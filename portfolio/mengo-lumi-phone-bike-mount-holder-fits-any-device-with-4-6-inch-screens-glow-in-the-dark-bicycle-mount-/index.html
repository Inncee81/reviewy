<p>Mengo Lumi Bike Mount Handy When on the Go
 
Just because you choose to ride a bicycle for transportation or fitness doesn’t mean you should be without the modern convenience of your cell phone, right? You can keep your device within arm’s reach with the stability of the Mengo Lumi Bike Mount during all your two-wheeled travels. This bicycle mount securely holds just about any device that has a screen size between 4 and 6 inches. Here are some of the Mengo Lumi Bike Mount’s other beneficial features:
 
The helpful glow-in-the-dark features provides up to two hours of illumination after just 15 minutes of exposure to a light source. That means you will always be able to locate your phone in low light and won’t have fumble for it while riding.
The mount is universal for both bikes and devices. No matter whether you ride a racing bike, mountain bike, old-school 10-speed, or fixed-gear cruiser, the Mengo Lumi Bike Mount will hold on tightly. The grip also fits any electronic device with a 4-6-inch screen. That could be a cell phone, a GPS, a training tool, or any other device.
The mount is made of durable silicone, which not only makes it very sturdy, but it also means your electronics will be held securely with no slippage, shaking, or falling. Regardless which terrain you choose to tackle on any given day, the mount will keep your device safe.
 The Mengo Lumi Bike Mount strap is adjustable for any diameter of handlebar or bike frame. If you’d rather attach the mount to your crossbar or even seat post, the strap can accommodate those locations as well.
The configuration of the bicycle mount allows you to still access the buttons and keys of your phone when it is in the mount. If you have an smartphone, the center button on the bottom is easily accessible.  The two bottom buttons remain exposed when the device is in the mount.
You can locate your bike more quickly in the dark if your Mengo Lumi Bike Mount is glowing. Or, if your ride is resting among a sea of other bikes, the illuminated mount will help you discern which is yours in a jiffy.
Slip your device in or out of the mount quickly and without struggle thanks to its thoughtful design and “sticky” silicone material. You can chart your riding time or track your distance easily because the bicycle mount’s strap configuration doesn’t block the crucial buttons of your device.</p>

<h5 id="dared-to-try-it-on-iphone-6">Dared to try it on iPhone 6+</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the iPhone bike mount products I was considering were disappointingly clumsy, until I came across the Mengo Lumi. Near perfect simplicity in design. Under a minute to install, no tools required, plenty secure, no bouncing, easy to move. I took a chance as I have an iPhone 6 plus with a low profile case. The silicone material is stretchy and strong and is holding my bigger phone just fine. Rather than the bottom cross-band interfering with the top of the home button as shown in the pictures, mine skims the bottom edge of the home button. No problems accessing any controls except for maybe the silencing switch, which is no big deal. If they come out with a version for iPhone plusses, I will upgrade, but for now I&rsquo;m very satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pricey-but-worth-the-money">Pricey but worth the money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A little pricey but does it&rsquo;s job well.At first I did not have it on tight enough and the phone was turning, but after stopping and stretching and tightening it another notch, it holds the phone perfectly fine. I mainly ride around the streets and there&rsquo;s a lot of jumping, bumps, etc. It holds the phone perfectly in place and I&rsquo;m able to tap and do things on the phone while biking.I have not used it at night yet, but when I get inside it&rsquo;s obvious that the mount is illuminated so it would be illuminated at night. Personally I would rather it just be a solid color and not glow, but it serves as a safety mechanism so that others can see you at night so it&rsquo;s fair.Worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-the-fact-it-is-one-piece-nothing-to-break">Like the fact it is one piece&hellip;nothing to break</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got a new bike and really wanted a phone mount. There are plenty of high rated mounts, but I didn&rsquo;t want one with a lot of different parts, then I looked at my handlebars and saw that they were not a uniform diameter, but tapered in size from grips to stem. The Mengo fit the bill in that it conforms to the handlebar shape. My first ride was in drizzly rain and I put my iPhone 6 (in an oversized case) in a sandwich bag for waterproofing, and it fit fine in the holder. No complaints, just hope it holds up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-simple-design-that-both-holds-its-position-on-the">A simple design that both holds its position on the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A simple design that both holds its position on the handlebar, if tightened enough, and secures the phone safely. A degree of shock is also absorbed by the material. The unknown is how long will the material continue its elasticity without failure. Hopefully it will last a long time since it is rather pricey for something so simple. I put a thin layer of rubberized shelf liner around the bar before installing this to increase the friction, but since I did this on the initial installation cannot say if it was necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="almost-there">Almost there.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it but have to work around the bottom strap&rsquo;s passing over the phone&rsquo;s home button. Not helpful but otherwise great device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-great-i-ve-only-gotten-to-use-it-once-so">This thing is great. I&rsquo;ve only gotten to use it once so &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is great. I&rsquo;ve only gotten to use it once so far but did a 16 mile road ride (really was on a paved bike trail) with it and loved it! I intended to listen to pod casts which I did, but I also chatted briefly with a friend and got a call from a doctor I otherwise would have missed. Probably shouldn&rsquo;t/wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I was really on the road but it&rsquo;s great for a trail. And if you needed to see a map it would work well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-the-best-bike-mount-i-purchased-it-may-not-look-like">This was the best bike mount I purchased it may not look like &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the best bike mount I purchased it may not look like it would work but it does . The reason I didn&rsquo;t give this five stars is because it does rattle your phone a bit and can disengage the Sim card. Taking the Sim card out and putting it back in again seems to fix it but it is a little annoying. However, even with issue which doesn&rsquo;t always happen it worked better than more expensive bulkier mounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-good-way-to-mount-your-cell-phone-to-your-bike">This is a good way to mount your cell phone to your bike &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good way to mount your cell phone to your bike while in a case. I don&rsquo;t know why it is glow in the dark. I have had this mounted for the last 3 months. The rubber is starting to stretch and it does not hold as well as when I bought it. I would expect this will only last 6-9 months before I will be looking for another one. This seems to be a short term solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mount">Great Mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this mount! I looked at the cheaper silicone ones but once you unmount the phone they fall off the handle bar. This one stays on!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="after-trying-many-bike-mounts-this-one-actually-hold">After trying many bike mounts, this one actually hold &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After trying many bike mounts, this one actually hold my iPhone 7 tight - even on bumpy roads and at high speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-the-bike-mount-holder-on-my-bike-but-it">I love the bike mount holder on my bike but it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the bike mount holder on my bike but it moves around on my scooter&hellip;.so I prefer it on my bike.. It is so cool and love the light up in the dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-but-a-little-tight">Very good but a little tight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The support is very good, simple and practical. The only point against it is that if the screen is 5.5 &ldquo;to 6&rdquo; the smartphone is very tight. It should be a little bigger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>ok product the glow in the dark doesnt last long</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-it-holds-my-iphone-7-with-battery-case">Works great. It holds my iPhone 7 with battery case &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. It holds my iPhone 7 with battery case no problem. I mounted it on a tapered handlebar without tape or a shim and it does not move. Even on rough trails.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-product-works-great-with-iphone-6s">Simple product - works great with Iphone 6s</h5>
