<h5 id="indestructible">Indestructible!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the TekHome Super Vacuum Fan for almost a year now and I love it! This was the best thing I&rsquo;ve bought for my laptop! The sticky stuff has warn off, it&rsquo;s been dropped, stepped on, yanked out of the laptop, and once thrown by an overeager three year old who thought it looked robotic! And the thing still does it&rsquo;s job! It&rsquo;s almost indestructible!I play some pretty heavy games (Skyrim/Dragon Age Inquisition/SWTOR) and the second it starts to get hot I just turn the dial and it&rsquo;s cool within a minute. My only caution would be to make sure the end isn&rsquo;t pointed toward something plastic. I melted a spoon I didn&rsquo;t realize was laying there until I glanced over at my bowl and saw it all twisted. HA!If this thing ever stops working, I will replace it with an exact copy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-product-worth-the-value">Very good product, worth the value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Price: got this on Amazon lightening deal for $10.Function: Very efficient, cooling my laptop all the time!Pro: No problem with the heat dissipation part, nice powerful design. Not much noise.Con: my laptop is thin and it doesn&rsquo;t fit so well, and thus I need something to fill the intake vent. This whole thing is bulky and not so convenient if you move the laptop a lot. User manual is too simple. Not a problem for me but I saw some reviewers complain about it.However, I can&rsquo;t ask more for 10 dollars. It solve my problem. I give 5 star.Environment: I have a ThinkPad twist and a cooling pad (Cooler Master). This laptop keep getting very hot and I guess it&rsquo;s because of the dust accumulated. The cooling pad doesn&rsquo;t work very well since it basically is a big fan that try to push more air for the laptop fan but the output vent size is fixed so it actually create a positive pressure and keep hot air in my case, which is bad. But this cooler works in a opposite way, it block part of my laptop fan, which prevent those damn dust and meanwhile increase the outward air flow as a negative pressure. It proves very effective!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-without-issue-and-solves-my-old-laptop-s-heat-issue-i-m-happy">It works without issue, and solves my old laptop&rsquo;s heat issue. I&rsquo;m happy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this to cool down my old Acer Aspire 4830TG-6450. It&rsquo;s a pretty dated machine, but it can still play some pretty decent mid-range games. The only thing is that eventually it heats up to uncomfortably dangerous levels. Which is where this little cooler comes in! I say &lsquo;little&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s a little bit larger than half the size of a desktop HDD, but much thicker. However it weighs next to nothing.The extendable appendage that slips under the laptop does a decent job of securing the device. Just be sure to keep the setup on a large flat surface to accommodate the laptop and cooler. Meaning, don&rsquo;t use this setup on your lap, couch, bed, or any other uneven surface. In my experience, the little double sided stickies that come with the cooler do little to secure the device. The heat from the laptop and ambient dust and particulates are enough to render the stickies useless.Unfortunately the rubber gasket doesn&rsquo;t fully contact with my laptop vent. Regardless of that, the pressure of the laptop fan pushing out and the suction of this device is enough to create a fairly powerful outward current. You are able to adjust the suction strength through the nob that sits on top of the device, and it works as advertised.</p>

<h5 id="its-ok-for-now">Its ok. FOR NOW&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its actually great, so far its keeping it cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-cooler">A great cooler!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Considerations:Why did I give it this rating?It works exactly as expected and promises. I am able to easily connect this device via USB to my laptop and have it cool the device down for gaming. Some more intensive games on my laptop stutter when the device isn&rsquo;t properly cooled, so this is a godsend.What do I like?I like the ease of use. Plug the device in and turn the knob - that&rsquo;s all you have to do. I also like the low price of the device, and that it is portable enough to burn with me should I need it on the go.Who would I recommend this to?Anyone who is experiencing throttling on their laptop due to overheating. Coolers like this mitigate that particular problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-decent-enough-laptop-cooler-for-the-price">A decent enough laptop cooler for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing this review, I&rsquo;d only used the product twice. However, it functioned as advertised and did so very well. The overall temperature of my laptop, stayed several degrees cooler than usual, when playing a graphically intense game. As a result, gameplay was smoother than when used without the device. The cooler is very simple to use and connect to the laptop itself. Time will tell, if I continue to have the same positive results.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-that-works">Great product that works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am really happy with TekHome Super Vacuum Fan. It connects easily and works right away right out the box, no software needed. The Blue light is bright enough to notice and makes it a cooler vacuum for that reason over others. Fan is a strong fast vacuum.Now for the bad. It is bigger than others out there. Also no temp display for it being so big is a bummer. BUT&hellip;BUT those 2 bads wont keep me from using it nor recommending it.Bottom line..It works ,its cool and I love it.Questions just ask ill try to answer</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-design">Great design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a cool laptop cooler. It has option to change the fan speed of the cooler. It can be placed near the laptop heat sink fan and turn On this using the knob on it. Due to work, sometimes macbook is getting too much of heat, it is hard to touch sometimes, with this cooler, it is letting out some of the heat from macbook and helps to work without worries.</p>

<h5 id="great-piece-great-product">Great piece great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost perfect product, excellent price I was very impressed with it&rsquo;s internal fan. Only issue is with it remaining attached.</p>

<h5 id="poor-quality">Poor quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste months on this product, low quality! Just used few days the motor or funs become ruff with super noise. No customer service at all. Waste my time.</p>

<p>Not very long life. I used it for about a month but it&rsquo;s not cooling as well as it used to now.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-fairly-awkward-to-use-if-you-plan-on">It&rsquo;s fairly awkward to use. If you plan on &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly awkward to use. If you plan on having your laptop in your lap at anytime this will not work for you. If you keep it on a table or desk it should be ok.</p>

<p>Works great, totally bitchin!Real</p>

<p>I tried it on a 2017 HP Spectre x360 13&rdquo;, which is very thin, but the vent sits too high, and the rubber adapter things don&rsquo;t work for it either.</p>
