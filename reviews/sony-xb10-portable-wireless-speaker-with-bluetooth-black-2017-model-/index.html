<h5 id="great-product-but-stereo-pairing-instruction-is-lacking">Great product but stereo pairing instruction is lacking!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 2 as I wanted stereo. They work wonderfully, with crisp clear sound, nice base, and plenty of power for my needs. Sony did a great job on the product itself, however they are lacking in the instruction for pairing when you have 2 of them&hellip; so I&rsquo;ll try and help.For Double or Stereo mode there are two separate pairings that have to happen.1) Pair one of the speakers to your phone via holding the power button until tones made then pair your phone2) Pair the two speakers to each other via holding the Add button until tones made, first on one speaker and then repeat on second speakerIf you pair both speakers to your phone then only one will be actively connected and both will show with the same name. After your pair the two speakers then the Add, volume +/-, and power off buttons on either speaker will actually control both speakers, power on is still separate though.Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-sony-speaker-for-beach-fun">Excellent SONY speaker for beach fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This speaker is very nice, with good quality and features. I was looking for something robust to take to the beach, with loud volume, and long battery life, but also light weight and with just the right size. This speaker has all these features. The sound is very loud and without distortion, even at the maximum volume. The build is of high quality, as it is always the case with SONY products, and it looks very nice too. The bluetooth pairing is very easy, and the controls are intuitive. I particularly like the added detachable support, which allows to place the speaker horizontally greatly enhancing the sound quality. Also, while the speaker is at maximum volume and even standing vertically, the rubber bottom keeps it steady without vibration. Overall this is an excellent speaker to carry anywhere outdoors, or to just use indoors, and it is very recommended.</p>

<h5 id="sony-srs-xb10-bluetooth-speaker-vs-beats-pill-review-sony-wins">Sony SRS-XB10 bluetooth speaker vs Beats PIll review&hellip; Sony wins!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m comparing the Sony SRS XB-10 to the Beats Pill+ Black which I also have.Design: Small with a rubberized outer coating the speaker is more portable than the Beats Pill and more rugged. The small rubber ring that is attached to the speaker makes it even more user friendly as you can hang it from anything like a bike handlebar or your dashboard or clip it to your backpack.There is a rubber gasket to cover the Micro USB port (cable included) and the audio in port.There are buttons for power, volume, play/pause, and bluetooth pairing. If you buy two of these you can set it up for stereo sound which is a nice option.Sound: Basically, they actually sound really great. I was skeptical but the BASS really is very good and I can feel it through the table for rap/hip hop.There is no distortion at loud volumes and the speaker is very loud for the size and would be great for the beach or by the pool or at a BBQ.Bluetooth setup: Hold the power button for 3 seconds and you are ready to pair it up. I used it with my Iphone 6 plus and it work flawlessly.I also paired it with a ASUS ROG Strix GL753VD 17.3&rdquo; Gaming Laptop GTX 1050 4GB Intel Core i7-7700HQ 16GB DDR4 1TB 7200RPM HDD RGB Keyboard and it really improved the sound of my laptop. Movies and games sounded much better when paired with the Sony XB-10.Battery life: 16 hours which is better than the Beats Pill at 12 hours. It makes a difference and I appreciate the extra battery life.Water resistance: It&rsquo;s not water proof but it is water resistant. IPX5 water resistant which means it can take a direct jet of water and still keep on working. &ldquo;Water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects&rdquo; per wikipedia.The actual brochure for the speaker says that is only water resistant to fresh water and tap water. Water resistance is &ldquo;not applicable to soapy water, pool water, seawater, etc.&ldquo;Overall, I really like this bluetooth speaker. It is more portable than the Beats Pill and has a longer battery life and has great bass and it is water resistant too. Works great with the Iphone and even as a computer speaker.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up below thanks!!!!!!</p>

<h5 id="love-this-speaker">LOVE this speaker!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this speaker! Great sound! Perfect size for my Beach bag! I originally bought the JBL clip and returned it because I was NOT pleased! Bought this one and LOVE it! I also use it at home! I am very please and recommend this! Great battery life!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-right">Just right</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a Sony Fan, this is a simple and good product. But I initially gave this 4 stars because I cannot pair it with the Echo Dot I bought on the Prime Day deal. So I ended up buying some aux cable as well.The stereo function is just fine, the bass is slight, enough to shake my table.One thing you should know is that if the output of your device is mono and use the stereo mode, only one speaker will do its job, the other one is muted. So you have to press add to bring both speakers back to do equal job.Edit: I edited this because I now managed to link it with the Echo Dot. It worked perfectly fine. The issues were actually from my poor understanding of how to use the Echo Dot. + pics for anyone who interested in my dual stereo set up.</p>

<h5 id="nice-and-even-better-if-paired">Nice and even better if paired</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound, small and portable and really works well and sounds nice when you have two speakers. Speakers can be set up to connect together, left and right. I recommend doing that. Small but fills the room with two.Speakers have volume button but not skip. You can use your phone for that though.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-great-i-had-gotten-another-one-that-was-just">This is great! I had gotten another one that was just &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great! I had gotten another one that was just $10 cheaper and had to return it because it sounded tinny (No bass at all) and didn&rsquo;t connect well. I bought this and took it to the beach this weekend and it worked great! Sound is really good (for the price!) and we were literally right by the water on a really windy day. It stayed connected and made it really easy to go from my phone to speaker. The size is perfect since I didn&rsquo;t really want anything really bulky at the beach. Love it!!</p>
