<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="stealthy-speed">Stealthy Speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have said, I don&rsquo;t use a hand mixer a whole lot, but when I need one, I need one. I love this mixer. I bought this mixer based on people saying it had a good low speed, and yes it does. My old mixer&rsquo;s speeds were high, super-high, and bat-out-of-hell high.To counter what others have said about the mixer&rsquo;s high speed seeming like medium, we put it to the tachometer test. Yes, the BF has a tachometer, so we hooked it up to the mixers. In the tachometer test, the old mixer&rsquo;s low speed started at 1050 rpm, with the highest speed being 1250 rpm- not a lot of range. The Kitchenaid 5 Speed&rsquo;s low speed was a nice mellow 260 rpm. Speed 2 was 450 rpm, then 650, 800, and 1100 rpm for speeds 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The thing is, even at the high speed, it&rsquo;s very quiet, and doesn&rsquo;t sound like a jet engine about to take off, so I believe it <em>sounds</em> like a lower speed, but it&rsquo;s more than enough to whip cream, egg whites, or whatever else you want that high speed for. As for power, I cannot comment; if I&rsquo;m going to mix bread dough, or some big heavy job, I get out the big heavy stand mixer. Right tool for right job and all that. It&rsquo;s certainly strong enough for some whipped potatoes- it handled creaming cold butter, no problem, so potatoes should be easy.</p>

<h5 id="this-mixer-does-a-great-job-at-a-good-price">This mixer does a great job at a good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great mixer, and I&rsquo;m not sure why someone said that the high speed wasn&rsquo;t enough to make meringues. It is. I have made several with it, and I&rsquo;ve only had this mixer for about six weeks. It also does a great job with mashed potatoes, and has mixed cookie dough as well. I really like the various speeds on it, and many thanks to the reviewer who put it to the tachometer test &ndash; that was the review that made me go ahead and order this Kitchenaid. The mixer is much quieter than other hand mixers I have had in the past, and I do think that that could make someone think the mixer didn&rsquo;t have enough power, if going by the sound. It&rsquo;s hard to tell your brain to ignore that, but you should, because this mixer has plenty of quiet power. I should also say that I am not a novice cook by any means, having raised eight kids in the past 35 years, and fed not only them, but crowds of their friends (and I do mean crowds). I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I would like the beaters, and they were actually one of my biggest hesitations in ordering this. I have always had the square, heavy duty ones, and these looked flimsy in the picture. After using this mixer a number of times, though, I have changed my mind on the blades. The wire blades seem to do a great job, and the dough, potatoes, cake batter, etc. doesn&rsquo;t cling to them as it does to the large square ones. Saves me a minute or two on scraping all the extra stuff off the blades and into the bowl at the end, and these beaters wash up much faster, without any residue clinging to the insides of the blades to gross out the next person who uses them. Hmmm &hellip; what else? Oh, the color. I bought the yellow, and I really like it. It is NOT exactly as pictured. The picture is honestly a cuter shade, and that was a small disappointment, but only a small one. I don&rsquo;t primarily buy a mixer for the color anyway (although I could if I weren&rsquo;t such a frugal person, because the colors are really cute). And the actual yellow color of the mixer that arrived reminded me of the yellow hand mixer my mother used when I was a little girl, so I can&rsquo;t complain. :)</p>

<h5 id="great-for-baking">Great for Baking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed to replace my old hand mixer that was slowly coming apart&hellip;and since I love my KitchenAid stand mixer so much, I thought I would get their hand mixer as well. Was happy that my favourite colour (red) was actually the cheapest option, which rarely happens. :PI tried this out on the weekend, and it worked great! I love it. The beaters are different from my last mixer (which were thicker and flat-ish), and I was a little worried that they might not work as well&hellip;but nothing to worry about, cause it works great. I&rsquo;m going to be making everyone around me fat for the holidays with all the baking I&rsquo;m going to be doing! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lacks-power">Lacks power</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really expected more from a KitchenAid product. I have the KitcheAaid stand mixer and it is great. But the stand mixer is heavy and a PITA to set up if all you want to do is mix something up quickly. But this hand mixer has very little power to it at all. Yes I know hey sell more powerful mixers, but I don&rsquo;t see why they would sell this one that is so lacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk-product">junk product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read of the reviews but I have had a kitchen aid mixer for at least 30 yrs so I simply couldn&rsquo;t believe the negative ones. Well I threw my last one away because one of the mixing blades would no longer fasten &amp; it was quite old. So now my new one has one mixing blade that fastens only with a lot of fiddling. This this is so cheaply made I think I could bend the blade with my bare hands (I am 84 yrs of age). No matter what you have thought of kitchen aid in the past DON&rsquo;T, DON&rsquo;T DON&rsquo;T buy one of these or like me regret it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-a-beast">This thing is a BEAST</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a BEAST! I use it literally almost every day and haven&rsquo;t had any issues. I like the multiple speeds and the auto beater ejector, I just wish it had a retractable cord. KitchenAid makes the best appliances and this is no exception. I&rsquo;d highly recommend it to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-mixer">Good Mixer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had a KitchenAid stand mixer for over 20 years and it is a quality product so when I wanted a hand mixer for quick mixing, I looked at KitchenAid mixers first. I loved the color of this mixer and I&rsquo;ve used it several times for everything from cookies, cakes and mashing potatoes and it does the job. My only complaint is the actual beaters seem thin and flimsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-very-versatile-beaters">Not very versatile beaters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I would like this, mostly based on the great reviews. But the fancy schmancy beaters don&rsquo;t work for what I want it to do. My old mixer that was barely clunking along with only one of its old fashioned beaters did a better job. Too bad I didn&rsquo;t find one that had free returns, now it&rsquo;s hardly worth the cost of returning and I have a mixer that doesn&rsquo;t work for what I need it for. (btw, I usually only use my mixer to shred cooked chicken. My old, cheaper mixer handled it like a champ. I should have just got the same model) This model has plenty of power, the problem is just with the design of the beaters, they don&rsquo;t cut like traditional beaters do. And i can&rsquo;t find any traditional beaters to order as an accessory. The red color sure is pretty though.</p>
