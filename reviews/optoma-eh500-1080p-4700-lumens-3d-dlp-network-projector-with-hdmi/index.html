<h5 id="image-quality-is-nice-fan-runs-quietly">Image quality is nice. Fan runs quietly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought two of these for a church setup. They are bright and come with a lot of connection option. Image quality is nice. Fan runs quietly.I do wish it had a horizontal keystone control. This caused a bit of a problem in the setup since it needs to be perfectly lined up to the screen. And it needed more distance than my older cheaper projector to fill the screen.However, considering the brightness and the price point, it&rsquo;s a nice projector.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bright-and-stable-if-arrives-working-out-of-box">Bright and Stable if arrives working out of box..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bright projector, and I have bought several for businesses, but have had several problems with them new out of the box. Easy to return and get a replacement, and once they work, they are solid and havent had any issues. Color is on point out of the box, brightness is almost too much for a smaller room, but can easily be adjusted down. Bulbs are cheap(er) to replace. Four stars only because three of them I purchased had to be returned/replaced due to a malfunction out of the box. Aside from that minor inconvenience Id still buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-projector-for-large-rooms-where-we-need-a-very-bright-display">This is a great projector for large rooms where we need a very bright display.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great projector for large rooms where we need a very bright display. We are using this for our church service at a middle school auditorium.I have only one complaint. The VGA output only reflects the VGA1 input. The output is used to feed a monitor so anyone on stage can see what is on the display behind them. And having a single VGA input works most of the time. However if someone wants to bring their own PC while they are on stage then we connect into the second vga input. That will not display on the vga output. If the HDMI 1 input is used there is no VGA output signal. It had been my home that I could do that. This was a feature I thought we bought.Outside of that it&rsquo;s great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-when-it-works">Great&hellip;When It Works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this projector because of the strong reviews and the number of lumens that it has. To be honest when it works it has a great picture and is very bright. The problem is &ldquo;When it works&rdquo;. The first one we got worked for about 4 months and the HDMI ports went bad. So after some effort I was able to get an RMA number and received an Optoma Official refurbished unit. I got that unit in on a friday. Installed it on a Saturday. Used it on a Sunday and it worked great. On Wednesday of that same week after being off for 2.5 days it will not turn on. Green power light flashes and nothing happens (we checked the lamp/lamp bracket/power cycled). I spoke with Optoma and now I have to be sent projector #3. Tom at Optoma has been helpful. I just feel like I am 1600 in and still do not have a solid projector solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-out-of-the-box">Great out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our church was looking to upgrade our entire video system including going to full 1080 HD. We needed a new projector for the sanctuary which holds around 850 people all on one level. The search was on for a brighter projector capable of giving us full HD capabilities as well as being able to bring in standard def video as well from a computer that is used from time to time. This had all the features we were wanting and a 3-year warranty that was one of the better coverages out there. We also purchased a new HD screen (16&rsquo; x 9&rsquo;) to replace the current screen we had which was for standard def. We swapped out the old one for the Optoma and nothing but great results! The video signal comes from a Tricaster 850 on 4.5 GHz cable and then we used an SDI to HDMI powered converter at the unit and have a 3&rsquo; HDMI cable from the converter into the Optoma. The unit hangs from our ceiling about 32&rsquo; from the screen. Adjusting the image to the screen was very easy and we have nothing but compliments from everyone.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-thrilled-with-it">Fantastic. Thrilled with it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful projectors, no problems, I&rsquo;m The IT and photographer for a large community center, I have a large studio, wow thrilled with it. Screen that I put together is 12&rsquo; by 19&rsquo; projector is around 25&rsquo; from screen.I can&rsquo;t find info on what 3d glasses it uses. Bought all kinds at best buy and returned them, they couldn&rsquo;t find the kind either. I&rsquo;m using a play station 3, and 3d blue Rays.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bright">Bright!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector is stunningly bright. We used it to fill the screen of a theater from a distance of about 75 feet. The image is rich and vivid.EXCELLENT purchase. GET IT!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="will-not-recommend-this-projector">will not recommend this projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A new optoma x600 can&rsquo;t be turned on again after turning off. Called Optoma technical support and they said that other costumers also experience the same issue and told us to bring to their repair center. But we return this projector to amazon instead. I, a IT support of campus, will not recommend this projector. Again amazon has A+ costumer service, thank you amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely amazing for the price, if I had the cash I would buy another one!</p>

<h5 id="this-projector-has-a-wonderful-view-for-our-church-sanctuary">This projector has a wonderful view for our church sanctuary</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector has a wonderful view for our church sanctuary. The picture is clear and the device cost less than several other options we were exploring that actually cost more.</p>

<h5 id="but-great-picture-in-the-dark">But great picture in the dark</h5>

<p>No high-definition sound output. But great picture in the dark. 3d works nice. Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend for a well light room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-brights-images-love-it">Pretty Brights Images love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this Optoma EH500 with 4700 Lumens as my main home theater projector at it was pretty power full with a very brights image.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-okay-not-worth-the-price-does-not-perform-as-stats-would-indicate">It&rsquo;s okay, not worth the price, does not perform as stats would indicate.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It did not wow me. At 4700 lumens I was expecting a lot better quality. Also, it does not have a horizontal shift, so you have to place it dead in the center of your screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice clear and bright picture</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived as expected</p>
