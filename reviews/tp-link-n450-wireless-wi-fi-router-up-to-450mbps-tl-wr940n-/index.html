<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-reception-and-easy-to-set-up-don-t-worry-about-the-other-reviews-like-i-did">Great reception and easy to set up. Don&rsquo;t worry about the other reviews like I did</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often write reviews but read a lot of them, and wanted to put this out there to help anyone considering this router.When I was comparing different lower cost routers it seemed like every product had negative reviews and pointed out flaws, to the point where it gave me pause on buying ANYTHING at all.But bottom line this is a very good router for the price, simple to set up, and I recommend it BIGLY1. Good reception in 2000 sq foot house. I have used multiple devices and streamed video with no problem.2. SO SIMPLE to set up - right out of box, connect cord, plug in power, and use the SSID and password printed on the S/N label - no need to log in and do any configurationDo not despair upon reading all the reviews and just order this if you&rsquo;re looking to stay under fifty buckaroos</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-router-i-ve-ever-owned">The best router I&rsquo;ve EVER owned</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I have owned this product for a little over two months.-First, set up was extremely easy. The SSID and password printed on the S/N label, there was no need to log in or do any sort of verifying online.-Second, range has been great. In a 1,100 sq. ft. apartment we are able to connect to a full strength signal in all rooms.-Third, SPEED! I have ran both 75 mbps and 25 mbps at different times and got almost my entire internet speed both separate times. If you check the speed test I ran we are getting almost the entire 25 mbps.-Fouth, streaming. We do ALOT of streaming and internet surfing. With this router we&rsquo;ve had two separate tv&rsquo;s streaming while phones and laptop were connected to the wifi as well. Not a single problem.My old router from Qwest used to crap out and we would occasionally have to unplug it and reset it. Also, it was almost impossible to stream from two TV&rsquo;s and use a laptop. Not anymore! This router is great. Some people in the reviews have complained about how bright the blue connection lights are, this has not been a problem for me. Granted we keep the router in the living room, but the lights have never bothered me. You can see in the picture they are not that bright.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-fast-verify-wi-fi-thermostat-compatibility">Easy to install. Fast. Verify Wi-Fi thermostat compatibility.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unpacking the router, reading the instructions and getting to the back of my computer took more time than the actual installation. It has very clear instructions and was a snap to hook up. The website and smartphone app are easy to maneuver. It&rsquo;s fast and works like a charm.My Echo found the wireless right away. My Sensi thermostat is still a work in progress. It is not listed on the incompatible thermostat list. But, it won&rsquo;t connect yet. If you have a Wi-Fi thermostat check compatibility.I&rsquo;m perplexed by the negative reviews.</p>

<h5 id="bought-for-my-sanity-at-family-member-s-house-well-worth-it">Bought for my sanity at family member&rsquo;s house. WELL WORTH IT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My mother has no idea what wi-fi is. It was terrible going to her house to have no connection. The only connection was to a single desktop computer in the office with the modem. For my own sanity I looked up the cheapest well reviewed router on Amazon and found this one. Set it up super easy and it works just fine for me and my mother who I taught to set up her phone on it.If you do this for your family member I highly recommend labeling all the cables with tape and neon sticky notes so if it gets unplugged they know what goes where. My mother had to rearrange the furniture and move it and she didn&rsquo;t have any trouble plugging it back in where the labels said. I also recommend taping a note to the router saying what the IP and password is as she did forget it a few times but was able to just look at the note I put there.She likes that she can have a password on the wireless as she didn&rsquo;t want people stealing her internet.For $20 you can&rsquo;t beat having access to the internet wirelessly. It has strong signal even on the second floor.No complaints. I haven&rsquo;t had her call me with any issues with it and I installed it 2 years ago. When I come over it is still working.</p>

<h5 id="there-s-a-caveat-to-buying-this-inexpensive-product-read-on">There&rsquo;s a caveat to buying this inexpensive product, read on&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes a lot of intricate work to get this router going, but eventually I was able to and I&rsquo;m happy it works.Here&rsquo;s the deal: the OEM firmware sucks. Speed was erratic and frustrating and some devices would drop out. We use the net for all entertainment like most millennials and between the kids&rsquo; Wii and all the iPads, iPhones and computers, I was skeptical that a cheapo router would be able to do the trick.The only way I was able to keep it is I also convinced my best friend to buy one when I did. He&rsquo;s brilliant and he traced the issue to the firmware and upgraded his to an open-source firmware. I followed suit and since then, mine has also been working.Bottom Line: If you are up to the potential task of replacing the factory firmware on this router with a better open-source version, spend the money and get it. If you want something that you just plug in and start using, spend a little more for something else.Range is readily accessible throughout my two-story 2500 square foot home and the speeds are up to snuff.Link to firmware:<a href="http://greggborodaty.com/installing-dd-wrt-tp-link-tl-wr841n/">http://greggborodaty.com/installing-dd-wrt-tp-link-tl-wr841n/</a></p>

<h5 id="best-bang-for-your-buck-great-speed-and-range">Best bang for your buck, great speed and range!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was very easy to install and update the firmware. Usually when you have the latest updates on your modem and router you will never have any issues unless they are PC related. I tend to look at a lot of reviews but in the end go with my gut and am glad I did on this one. The range is crazy on this thing. I get signal two houses away with this and my speed went from 15-20 mbps to 79 mbps with this one and I didn&rsquo;t even change my modem. Never crashed or failed on me once! If you don&rsquo;t get better speed with this I&rsquo;m sure you either need a new or updated modem or new internet provider!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easiest setup I&rsquo;ve ever done. Didnt have to deal with turning on/off everything six times like I&rsquo;ve done with most routers (lucky enough to only have to do it once and then bam:&hellip;</p>

<p>The wired connection works fine on this modem but the WiFi frequently fails forcing you to restart it. This happens at least once every 2-3 days and is very annoying.</p>

<p>I was kinda skeptical regarding some of the review I&rsquo;ve read and the price of this modem/router. However, I thought Id give it a try and it is great and worth every penny.</p>
