<h5 id="camera-comes-with-everything-and-has-tons-of-features">Camera comes with everything and has tons of features.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This camera comes with everything to get started including the camera, lens cover, attachable microphone, charging cable and block, protective storage case, and hdmi cable. The only thing it doesn&rsquo;t come with is an SD card, but most cameras like this don&rsquo;t include a memory card. The camera is well built, heavy and sturdy. The swinging screen door snaps open and closed and the lens cap also snaps on securely. The microphone is removable and screws on and does not move once fastened. The camera is basically the same size as a sony handycam and has many of the same features.The screen is bright and easy to view and the camera is so simple to operate. Just charge the battery, insert a memory card, open the door and hit record. The included hdmi wire can be used to connect to a TV to view recordings. Recording quality is pretty good with high resolution and pretty bright colors and good contrast. Darker lighting environments does create some challenges just like it does with other similar models. My wife used to have a Sony Handycam which had a similar issue with some graying. These camcorders don&rsquo;t have as large a sensor as professional cameras but they perform just fine for recording family videos, sporting events, and other everyday activities.The microphone is excellent because you can pick up sounds from longer distances. The db level can be adjusted depending on the distance from the audio source which is a very nice feature.Overall, for just over $100, there is a lot included in this package. It will be great for family videos and does record quality audio and video.</p>

<h5 id="son-used-it-for-youtube-videos">Son used it for youtube videos</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got it for my son because the price point was very attractive. He used it to create some gaming youtube videos and it has been working out well for him. I have not played with all the settings in the camcorder yet. He used the default record option and the video quality has been option. The attached mic has also helped. Without the mic, the sound quality does degrade. So happy that I got the combo.Pls note that it does not come with the SD card. It accepted by 64GB Samsung card with no issues. The first time I used it, it formatted the card and then it just records.</p>

<h5 id="capture-video-memories-and-pictures-quickly-and-on-on-the">Capture video memories and pictures quickly and on-on-the</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This little HD camera is all you need for high quality video footage on the go. I highly recommend this camera. It is so lightweight and the remote made it easy to control from my tripod or any stationary position and surface I placed it on. I really like the night vision function. The video footage with the night vision feature all came out crystal clear. The 16X zoom made it easy while I was on vacation, to capture footage of the 2017 solar eclipse and the stereo microphone made the sound quality impressive. I was able to record video and take photos all with the push of 1-button and then immediately connect the camera to my flatscreen television and playback it back on the large screen. If you&rsquo;re looking for a powerful take anywhere video camera, this is it!</p>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Price I purchased at: $103So&hellip;The reason I listed the price out first is because I am not sure if it will be changing in the future. But I will review this product based on its price. That being said, I won&rsquo;t go take it and compare it to a $500+ product side by side, because that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, and it is obvious the main sell point of this product is on its attractive price.The Pros&hellip;-The device is super lightweighted, an adult or teens would have no trouble holding it and film stuff at all.-The flip screen allows you to see easily what you are filming, and you can easily adjust the angle. When done filming, you can flip the screen outward to view what you recorded.-Picture and Video mode, switch in between very interactive without additional unessary click.-Support night version, the result is resonableThe Cons&hellip;-Not too much given the price it is selling at really&hellip;But I can be honest and tell you if you have an iPhone, you might find it havning better quailty in term of both fimiling product and voice capturing.-The mic does calls in background noise, and it is required in order for voice capturaizing.</p>
