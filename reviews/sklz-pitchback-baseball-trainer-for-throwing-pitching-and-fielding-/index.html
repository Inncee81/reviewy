<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-time">Don&rsquo;t waste your time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The ball went straight through the net the very first throw. The hole is growing to the size of a soccer ball now. Don&rsquo;t waste your time on this product,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="falling-apart-already">Falling apart already!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s already falling apart - the clips that hold the netting on are breaking. And the only person using it is a 6 year old, so the wear and tear is quite minimal.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-fine">its fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>that red square is a ribbon that you put on yourself. its good that you can customize the size but there should be something given to fasten the ends of the ribbon securely. tape eventually got dirty and would lose its adhesion.</p>
