Product Description
Canon VIXIA HF G40 Camcorder</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Advanced Video Capture On the Go</p>

<p>Compact, capable and easy to use, Canon&rsquo;s VIXIA HF G40 camcorder offers the optical refinement and dynamic advanced performance experienced videographers want in a lightweight and portable package. Using a Genuine Canon 20x High Definition Optical Zoom lens and a new, highly sensitive HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor with improved low-light performance, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder provides sharp, Full HD video with beautiful highlight and shadow detail in virtually every lighting situation. A DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor speeds up operation and enables the lens&rsquo;s powerful image stabilization for clear and stable images, even when shooting handheld. For fluid use in numerous situations, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder has a 3.5-inch touch-capacitive screen, plus a tiltable electronic viewfinder. A host of manual controls are complemented by two modes: Wide DR Gamma and Highlight Priority, which help capture color and detail virtually consistent with how they&rsquo;re seen by the naked eye. Creative options are expanded with a new interval recording option that can capture fast motion of up to 1200x the original speed. Ideal for an incredible variety of uses, the VIXIA HF G40 is a stellar choice for anyone who requires professional-quality videos on the go.</p>

<p>Genuine Canon 20x High Definition Optical Zoom Lens</p>

<p>The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features a Genuine Canon 20x HD Video Lens offering a 35mm equivalent of 26.8–576mm with a minimum object distance of just 23.6 inches (60cm). Incorporating advanced elements and coatings, it helps reduce flare, ghosting and other distracting effects, delivering sharp, clear images with minimal distortion.</p>

<p>The VIXIA HF G40 features an 8-blade Circular Aperture, which helps reduce the &ldquo;starburst&rdquo; effect found in camcorders with non-circular apertures. The result is that points of light in out-of-focus areas, usually the background of your shot, are beautifully circularly blurred, creating an authentic and artistic feel. The professional touch of a manual focus ring allows accurate and precise control. For extra flexibility, the manual focus ring can be easily set to control zoom instead.</p>

<p>New, Advanced HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor with Improved Low-light Performance</p>

<p>New, Advanced HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor
For incredibly sharp and detailed high-definition video recording, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features a reengineered, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.84-inch, 2.91 Megapixel HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor that captures approximately 2136 x 1362 pixels. Thanks to the sensor&rsquo;s enhanced sensitivity, the VIXIA HF G40 helps provide vivid, accurate recording through an improved signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p>Improved Low-light Performance
Featuring an improved, low-luminance noise rating of +3 dB, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is able to capture clearer, sharper images in lower light, with even better detail.</p>

<p>1080/60p Recording in MP4
1080/60p Recording in MP4
The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder gives you high-quality recording whether you&rsquo;re capturing MP4 or AVCHD files. 1080/60p recording captures twice the amount of information as 60i, and with images captured at a rate of up to 60 frames per second, diagonal noise is virtually eliminated so even fast moving subjects show up crisply with motion and patterns clearly recorded. This greater sense of detail and faithful rendering of moving edges, plus enhanced color and fine tonal gradation, gives your video everything Full HD has to offer. With the VIXIA HF G40 you can record in internet-ready, easy-to-share MP4 format at up to 35 Mbps. The VIXIA HF G40 also features a maximum bit rate of 28 Mbps for AVCHD recording, the highest in the AVCHD standard. So, regardless of the format you&rsquo;re shooting or viewing, image quality is outstanding.</p>

<p>Native 24p Progressive Mode
The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features the Native 24p Progressive Mode, which allows up to 24 frames per second to be captured and recorded (instead of the standard 60i) – a look that is evocative of traditional cinematic quality, and a must for serious filmmaking work.</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi Technology with FTP Transfer Capability</p>

<p>Click here for larger image
Built-in, dual-band (5 GHz/2.4 GHz) Wi-Fi technology on the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder lets you share your HD video easily, and in a number of different ways. Connect with compatible networks, wireless hotspots and iOS mobile devices using the free Canon Movie Uploader app*. Transfer files to selected FTP servers for back up or when a quick transfer is necessary. Share videos over the internet with CANON iMAGE GATEWAY – an online photo storage service that lets you upload to social networking sites. Watch videos stored on the camera&rsquo;s memory cards directly on your living room TV, or use your PC or mobile device to browse remotely through the previously recorded videos stored on your camcorder, without connecting a cable†. The Remote Browse function uses a standard Web browser and does not require a special app.</p>

<p>Additionally, Wi-Fi technology allows remote control of key camcorder controls, such as recording start/stop and zoom (in three different speeds), exposure functions (iris, shutter speed, gain and more) and focus settings, adding another level of freedom to your shooting abilities.</p>

With its 20x Optical Zoom HD Video lens, its new HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor and the powerful DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor working together to capture and process the images at hand, the VIXIA HF G40 is positioned to deliver HD video that is nothing short of stunning.</p>

<p>3.5-inch OLED Viewscreen with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio and EVF
3.5-inch OLED Viewscreen with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio
The touch-sensitive Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) panel on the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder boasts an impressive viewing angle, color reproduction, contrast and touch responsiveness. Your vivid, clear video will be reproduced faithfully with approximately 1.23 million dots of resolution. And the touch responsiveness of the screen is smooth and sensitive, enabling fluid control of camera functions like Touch &amp; Track, Touch Focus and Touch Exposure.</p>

<p>Electronic Viewfinder
The VIXIA HF G40 features a 0.24-inch, approximately 1.56 million-dot color electronic viewfinder with approximately 100% field of view coverage for detailed, accurate composition judgment. The viewfinder can be tilted up to 45° from its normal resting position to enable a great amount of shooting freedom. Settings can be adjusted with a handy joystick so you don&rsquo;t have to stop looking through the viewfinder. And, because it is positioned where your thumb naturally rests while holding the camera, you can shoot and adjust easily – even with one hand!</p>

<p>Dual SD Card Slots, Using Readily Available, Consumable Media
The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder allows you to record video directly to widely available SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards with capacities ranging from over 32GB to 2TB. They are available in ultra-fast reading and writing speeds and make it easy to share video.</p>

<p>Dual and Relay Recording
Dual Recording
Dual Recording and built-in transcoding help ensure that you&rsquo;ll have the right format available for your needs. Using the power of the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder can simultaneously record video in AVCHD format to one SD card, and in MP4 format to the other SD card^. The widely used MP4 format provides quick, conversion-free playback on compatible tablets and smartphones, and lets you upload videos directly to select social networking sites for easy sharing with friends, family and the world. AVCHD is ideal for watching videos on an HDTV or archiving them to Blu-ray discs. The camcorder also has a built-in transcoding function that converts AVCHD files to MP4s, making them easy to upload to the Web or save to an SD card.</p>

<p>^ Simultaneous recording is not supported when using MP4 (35 Mbps), AVCHD Progressive (28 Mbps) or Cinema-Look Filters.</p>

<p>*1 29.97P recording is performed when the format for the card in the main slot is 59.94i, PF29.97 or 29.97P; 23.98P recording is performed when it is 23.98P.</p>

<p>Relay Recording
Dual slots on the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder enable Relay Recording. The camcorder automatically switches to the second memory card when the first becomes full, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about running out of recording time during a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime shot.</p>

<p>Wide DR Gamma (600%)
For natural and realistic-looking image capture that faithfully represents the scene at hand, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features a Wide DR Gamma mode. By suppressing overexposure in high brightness areas of the composition, this mode helps achieve a wide dynamic range of 600% to produce virtually seamless tone gradations, resulting in smooth detail, accurate color and virtually no blown-out highlights.</p>

<p>Highlight Priority Mode
To capture highly saturated, realistic colors and to convey gradation characteristics as perceived by the eye, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder has a new Highlight Priority mode that achieves effects similar to HDR modes in other camcorders. By reducing the mid- to high-brightness compression of the standard gamma mode, the Highlight Priority mode helps to prevent loss of detail in high brightness areas. Designed for display on a bright LCD TV, videos captured in Highlight Priority mode should be shown at a high brightness setting to help ensure accurate portrayal of the effect.</p>

<p>View Assist Function that Supports Highlight Priority Mode
When using the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder in Highlight Priority mode, the View Assist function increases brightness and medium tone gamma in the camera&rsquo;s viewfinder or OLED panel. This allows images to be displayed with the brightness and gradation with which they are being recorded or reviewed, helping to ensure the subjects look natural and realistic.</p>

<p>Intelligent Optical Image Stabilization System with Powered and Dynamic Modes and Auto On/Off
Canon&rsquo;s sophisticated SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer corrects camera shake instantly, so even handheld video taken at long focal lengths can be sharp and steady. The power of Canon&rsquo;s DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor has made possible a versatile Dynamic Image Stabilization mode. In addition to providing continuous adjustment throughout the entire zoom range to correct a broad range of motion, with extra compensation applied at wide-angle focal lengths, the system stabilizes rotational camera shake. Controlling rotational camera shake – horizontal, vertical and roll axis – helps ensure smooth, virtually distortion-free video, even when you&rsquo;re walking while shooting.</p>

<p>Full Manual Control
Custom Key and Dial
A Custom Key and Dial feature allows you to assign functions to an easily accessible key and adjust the settings with a control dial. The functions include:</p>

<p>Tv/Av: Use the dial to adjust shutter speed (Tv mode) or aperture (Av mode), as needed. In this mode the key has no effect.
Manual exposure: When manual control is selected, the dial can adjust aperture, shutter speed or gain. Select items to adjust, such as aperture or other settings, with the key.
Exposure Lock can be set on or off as can the AGC Limit.
Composition Aids
With the Level Marker feature, it&rsquo;s easy to keep the camcorder level for more accurate framing. The Grid Marker provides a reference grid in your viewfinder. Depending on the background color of your shot, you can choose between two different colors (white or gray) for better viewing contrast.</p>

<p>Gain Control
Gain may be manually set from 0 dB to 24 dB in 1 dB increments. Additionally, Auto Gain Control Limit allows you to set the maximum gain limit for the image sensor&rsquo;s sensitivity. With this function, brightness and noise can be balanced as required, and image quality can be maximized in low-light situations.</p>

<p>Power Zoom
Power zoom is available in Variable and Constant settings in 3 modes: Fast (approx. 1.9–60 seconds), Normal (approx. 2.5–180 seconds) and Slow (approx. 4.0–285 seconds). To provide added control, there are 16 predefined steps in Constant mode.</p>

<p>Ergonomic, Portable Design
Weighing approximately two pounds including the battery and lens hood, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is ideal for high-action shoots when both speed and mobility are essential, and where keeping a low profile is an added benefit. Though small in size, this camcorder sacrifices nothing when it comes to professional functionality. It features a “seesaw” style zoom lever, manual focus/zoom ring and joystick for easy control and an electronic viewfinder that can tilt up to 45° for low-angle shooting. It also has five Assign Buttons to help it fit to your operational needs.</p>

<p>High Definition Peaking for Focus Assist
To enhance focusing capability, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder provides Focus Assist. It includes enlargement, which helps in capturing your subject in razor-sharp focus. It works by providing a 2x magnification of your subject, which is automatically cancelled when you start recording. Also included is color peaking, which shows the shooting object&rsquo;s focused areas in actual colors.</p>

<p>Assignable Buttons for Custom Shooting
The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is equipped with five assignable buttons so that the camcorder can be tailored to the specific preferences or needs of the user.</p>

<p>Connectivity to Various Inputs and Outputs
Not only does the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder provide the user with incredible control over the image, it also provides immense creative freedom when it comes to inputs and outputs, including:</p>

<p>HDMI Output (HDMI mini connector, time code can be superimposed)
Composite Video Output (3.5mm)
USB Hi-Speed Terminal
Microphone Input (3.5mm)
Headphone Jack (3.5mm)
Remote Control Terminal (compatible with LANC protocol)
Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe
High-capacity Battery Included
The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is powered by a high-capacity battery pack. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery not only lets you shoot for a long time, but features intelligent technology that accurately indicates remaining battery time for extra insurance that you won&rsquo;t miss an important shooting opportunity.</p>

<p>Linear PCM Audio Recording2 and Audio Scene Select
Linear PCM Audio Recording2
Professional-quality 16-bit PCM* recordings offer enhanced sound quality and fidelity and are fully compatible with video- and audio-editing software.</p>

<ul>
<li>Only supported in 28 Mbps and 24 Mbps recording modes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Audio Scene Select
Audio Scene Select offers five modes and one custom mode that automatically optimize settings based on the recording situation, making it easy to record realistic, immersive audio in a range of situations.</p>

<p>Compatible with Optional Canon WM-V1 Wireless Microphone
Canon helps you get more out of your camcorder with a range of optional accessories that inspire creativity and productivity. One such example is the Canon WM-V1 Wireless Microphone, which streams audio wirelessly from subjects up to 164 feet away. It can be ideal for adding your subject&rsquo;s voice at times when you can&rsquo;t get in close to shoot, and can also be used as a stand-alone transceiver to cue shooting and more.</p>

<p>Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe
The Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe allows you to attach optional Canon accessories, such as the Video Light VL-5, Directional Stereo Microphone DM-100 or 5.1-Channel Surround Microphone SM-V1.</p>

<p>Advanced Display Features: Zebra, Color Bars and Test Tone
Videographers with exacting needs will appreciate the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder&rsquo;s range of functions designed to pinpoint focus adjustment and exposure control while helping you get professional-level quality from the camcorder. Zebra pattern indicates “blown out” or high brightness areas to help you set proper exposure. Color bars and test tone can be selected and recorded in order to adjust video and audio quality.</p>

<p>Slow and Fast Motion, including Interval Recording from 2x to 1200x
Slow and Fast Motion Modes allow the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder to record a different frame rate than the playback frame rate (only in MP4 recording modes), for a fast or slow motion effect during playback. Since the camcorder is recording real frames and modifying the playback rate, there is virtually no quality loss and maximum image quality is maintained. Additionally, interval recording allows the user to record frames at specified intervals, providing time-lapse recording of up to 1200x and slow motion down to 0.4x of the original speed.</p>

<p>The camera itself has amazing quality, and is a huge upgrade from my consumer grade camera.You can search YouTube and see video quality of the camera (Amazon compress video so it is pointless me uploading a demo video here).The menu system is very cumbersome. Some items work with the touchscreen and remote, others the touchscreen only. Navigating is an infuriating drilling down in to menus. There is no quick way (save turning the camera off and on again) to get back out of a nested menu, you have to traverse all the way back up again to use the camera. That being said, these menus are typically going to be used once or very infrequently.The deciding factor on my election of this camera over others in the Canon lineup was the claimed WiFi ability. After literally hours of setting this up (which is problematic as there is no ability to test a setting before proceeding, so if it doesn&rsquo;t work you don&rsquo;t know if the camera is connected to WiFi, if the FTP settings are correct, etc) I recorded some video and set about uploading it to my Mac via FTP. What a joke. FTP is an obvious afterthought. To send a file is a complicated and multistep process, taking a couple of minutes to achieve. Conversely I can remove the SD card and copy the file much much quicker.I thought I would have more luck with the file browser app for iOS. Nope. This app is just a bookmark to a web address.The marketing guys said &ldquo;we need WiFi, we need iOS, we need cloud sharing&rdquo;. The engineers said &ldquo;it is Friday afternoon; the bar is beckoning; so here, use this collection of garbage we knocked up in-between playing Minecraft&rdquo;. Awesome camera but terrible WiFi and sharing &lsquo;features&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I have only had this HF G40 for 6 days. I have not yet used it much outside but the home videos I have taken at home and at my son&rsquo;s basketball game seem to have very good picture. Gymnasium lighting is always tricky but these videos turned out very well and I was on Auto Mode. I am not a pro, but I wanted a really nice camera to record our kid&rsquo;s activities (many in low or bad lighting such as cheer competitions, gymnastics and basketball). I also like that this was a bit bigger than a typical consumer grade camera. I realize the trend with technology is to go small but this is bigger than my last camera making in more comfortable to hold. This was a big upgrade from my prior camcorder (Canon HF M31). My main attraction was the good low light reviews. As of now it seems to handle low light better than my prior camera, for sure!My one complaint is that the wifi is very complicated to set up. I have yet to be successful at setting up the wifi. There are multiple uses for the wifi feature (link to iPhone, tablet, computer, etc., for controlling, viewing and/or transferring data) I am not able to figure any part of this out. They must be aware of the problem because the camera comes with a whole separate instruction book for wifi set-up. It&rsquo;s disappointing that in a computer age where it usually only takes one or two clicks to connect to wifi, that this is so complicated. I also downloaded their Movie Upload iPad app thinking that may help guide the process but that was no help. I consider myself pretty computer savvy and I usually figure things out pretty quickly. In this case, I eventually gave up on the wifi (at least for now). That said over all the camera is very nice, If I can figure some of these wifi issues out it may bump up to 5 stars.UPDATE: Two months after writing the above review I have gotten a lot more use out of this camera. I can confirm that the picture quality is excellent! I have been using it for my son&rsquo;s baseball games and have been blown away by the quality of the HD picture. Even more impressive, I recorded our daughter&rsquo;s dance recital in very low light. The picture is awesome. Absolutely no low light noise at all. The picture is crisp and has no grain or fuzz at all! Very good camera! I will try to submit some video clips soon&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p> I am a professional wedding videographer and use a Canon 6D as my main camera. I purchased the G40 as a secondary camera when shooting receptions and beauty pageants. My main interest in this camera is the &ldquo;dynamic range&rdquo; and so far it is really good compared to camcorders with no extra dynamic range.The 6D has a &ldquo;full frame&rdquo; sensor so I thought the G40 &ldquo;HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t compare in image quality but I was very surprised to see it looks very nice next to the 6D footage - not as detailed but very good!Other good points:1. The image stabilizer is fantastic for handheld shooting and ok while walking.2. The dynamic range option adds more detail in the shadows and lessons harsh highlights. *it also adds 6db to the brightness for some reason.3. The touch screen is very good quality4. The manual controls are very good although you have to adjust in the touch screen every time.Other points: It is a bit heavier than most camcorders but it is solid quality.I would highly recommend this for regular users and for pros as a second or &ldquo;wide&rdquo; video camera.If the attached video doesn&rsquo;t play correctly, See my video comparison at the link below:[&hellip;]</p>
