<blockquote>
<p>Bought a Vizio. Broke at 13 months, so Vizio said &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; and hung up the phone. These guys handled my call and figured out a solution. You talk to a different person each time you call, but they keep good notes. I did have to haggle with them to make sure they were doing their job, but in the end, they came through. I will likely use them again.</p>
