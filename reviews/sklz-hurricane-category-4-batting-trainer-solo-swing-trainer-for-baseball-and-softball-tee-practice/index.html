<h5 id="would-be-great-if-the-arm-didn-t-keep-breaking">Would be great if the arm didn&rsquo;t keep breaking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought this would be great for my son because the batting cages were starting to add up and the machines weren&rsquo;t always calibrated correctly. At first, this was great but the arm piece broke after about a month. The company sent a new one, which was ok. He was playing fall ball at that point and was getting enough practice so he didn&rsquo;t use it much. Then winter set in and it was put in storage. He got it out some this year to start warming up for spring ball and the thing broke again! First time, a defect maybe. Second time, poor quality workmanship or design. It was quite expensive especially as a single mother with little disposable income. One of the less than ideal birthday presents I&rsquo;ve ever gotten him!Update: upon seeing my review, the company contacted me and my son, and talked with him about the problem. They sent a new arm and he sent photos of the concern, which tells me they care enough to want to improve their product. I&rsquo;m impressed! Not many companies do that these days. I have seen other SKLZ products and would definitely choose them again for more training aids. I appreciate a company that stands by their products!</p>

<h5 id="great-batting-trainer">Great batting trainer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my kids use this every day and it is amazing. The height adjustment is a tad wonky, but my kids figured it out and can do it themselves, so that is all that matters. The varying springs to adjust resistance is perfect knowing that through the years they will get stronger. Glad I bought this one vs. the flimsy tee stands that I hear fall over all the time. This is super sturdy and no way is this tipping over. My husband even hits with this and no issues on stability or tipping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-our-team">Worked for our team!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked out perfectly for my kid&rsquo;s softball team! It&rsquo;s hard to wrangle 15 six year old girls and there&rsquo;s bound to be some idle time. But if you have idle time you&rsquo;ve lost the 6 year old! This created an additional station for practice. The girls could hit on the hurricane until their turn up to bat. We took these to warm ups prior to games and it helped the girls with hitting!Well built product and it definitely helps my kid with her hitting skills!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-hitting-aid">Solid hitting aid!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my 6 year old since I started him late in baseball. I was in shock at the turnaround. Before we got this, he was barely hitting off a tee. After a week of hitting on the hurricane, He was hitting 50% of coach thrown balls! This is a wonderful product for swing mechanics and hand eye coordination.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-waited-to-review-and">I waited to review and&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Still amazed. This was a Christmas gift for our 10 year old son. His admiration &amp; drive to be the best baseball player alive is strong. At 10 years old playing catch in the backyard is great but how often can you take full swings &amp; get the feedback needed to correct your form without breaking a window or 2? Trust us&hellip;. We know!The Hurricane is extremely sturdy. It&rsquo;s heavy when broken down but any adult or larger youth could carry it without much of a problem. It fits in my trunk just fine. Personally I went out into the backyard myself &amp; took a few pretty good cracks at it &amp; again, no issues.This machine is well built &amp; I have no fear that my child can go into the backyard &amp; swing away without worry of string snapping or rods cracking. This was a home-run purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="from-zero-to-hero">From zero to hero!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter is 7 years old and plays coach pitch baseball. She was striking out every game so I decided to try this trainer out. I&rsquo;m glad I did, she is now getting infield home runs and now the best hitter on the team. No exaggeration. A must buy!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-hitting-aid">Great Hitting Aid!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent hitting aid. Gives my son great reps and he&rsquo;s building power. He is constantly grooving it before games. I love the way we can simply set it out in the evenings and he gets a good workout rather than having to go pitch him BP every time at fields or depend $ at cages. It is helping a string level swing a lot and he treats it like s game.CON:It&rsquo;s the first item that&rsquo;s made me feel awkward because I am reluctant to allow a lot of others to use it because of all the reviews. Spending so much money and having it broken by others is not worrisome. Feels stingy which I hate but I want it last long time it&rsquo;s so expensive.</p>

<h5 id="best-tool-for-workin-on-form">Best tool for workin on form</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wish they had this when I was a kid. Purchased for my son, after opening I used it for an hour and had a blast. Best tool for workin on form, awesome for inside use on rainy days.</p>
