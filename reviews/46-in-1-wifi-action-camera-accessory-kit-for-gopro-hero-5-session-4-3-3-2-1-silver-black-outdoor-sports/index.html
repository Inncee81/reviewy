<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-great-starter-kit-for-your-gopro">A great starter kit for your GoPro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a generic GoPro camera that uses all the same attachments that the real GoPro uses. I was looking for a wide assortment kit that included a few key items. I needed it to have the extendable stick, as well as handlebar attachment, and sticky pad attachments. This kit contained the essentials I needed plus a lot more! I also really liked the pull-strap bag it came it. It&rsquo;s very convenient for bringing my attachments on the go.Quality:The plastic used in most of the accessories is very good. It&rsquo;s on par with authentic GoPro attachments and is very solid. The straps used are also very good and will hold up for a long time. The screws all work great and have no issues with cross-threading or not fitting properly.Variety:This kit has a great selection of attachments that will suit most anyone&rsquo;s needs. It has an extendable stick which is great and the body straps are pretty useful too. There is a floating attachment for water, and a tripod that can be used for cell phones too. There are a lot of smaller attachments for poles, dashboards, helmets, and basically any surface you can stick it onto.Overall I am very pleased with this kit. The selection is fantastic and the quality is very nice. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone who is just starting off and wants a nice selection. If you have most attachments you need and just want certain ones then it&rsquo;s best to buy them individually.Writing in-depth reviews to help other shoppers has become a hobby of mine. If you found this review helpful please mark &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; below. Also, feel free to ask any questions and I will answer them for you!Disclaimer:I did receive this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</p>

<h5 id="nice-set-with-good-choices">Nice set with good choices</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To disclose from go, this item was received for sampling purposes either for a reduced cost or for free. If this is an issue in any way, please skip it (hence putting this at the beginning).TL;DR, I gave this a 5, or an &ldquo;I love it&rdquo; rating, due to the fact that this has just about anything you would want in a set. This ranges from mounting gear, mounts, cutout casing, and more.When examining accessory kits, you have to think about what needs you truly want to meet and pick your items from that. Sometimes, in smaller kits, you have to become very selective, but in larger kits, you have a lot of options with a few selections varying from kit to kit. With this kit, you have a lot of items represented in other large kits, plus you have some items that appear in a few kits and one I have not seen (as of yet) popping up in kits. The size of the kit and the representation here make it good to pick up and have.With this kit, this is the first I have actually gotten that has the casing with it, and that is a GREAT and needed item. The reason you want it is to be able to optimize sound and maximize picture without obstruction while also being able to mount it. A lot of people opt for a skeletal case, which is essentially a waterproof case with a cutout side port, and that works when needing impact resistance. When wanting mounting but also wanting the aforementioned items, this is a great item and ends up costing roughly half the price of this set if purchased separately.When it comes to mounting accessories, you have plenty of items to assist with mounting on all types of surfaces. The 3M attachments and the differing mount types make it possible to attach a camera in a vehicle, on something like a bike, helmets, and more, plus you can also work on mounting them on small items. For example, mounting on a fishing pole is possible with creative use, giving you some interesting angles. You additionally have screws and a spanner included, which helps for mounting and closing something tightly, and with adjustments. I would suggest getting one other spanner if you are inclined to use one outdoors, as losing your sole spanner and needing to take something loose is a pain.For mounting, you have a number of options when it comes to body mounts, including a chest mount, a head mount, and a wrist mount. Each has its pros and cons and end up making a complete recording profile. For myself, I end up using a chest mount a lot due to the fact that I am tall and it gives me more stability. Now, were I in a kayak or on a bike and recording, I might use a head mount (with a lot of attention paid to securing) to get above the item and my movement. The wrist mount is great for directional use with the 360 swivel, and it makes for less stable but more mobile/directional use.Included here are also a monopod with more in common with a selfie stick than anything, and an adjustable tripod. I like the tripod type here because of the flexi legs, making it easy to situate and contort. This means it will work in lots of different places, making it adaptable to lots of placements and positioning.You also have a floater, which is something you absolutely need for water-related filming, and an alligator clip.Item breakdown per product page:Package Included:1 x Somate Chest Belt Strap Mount1 x Somate Frame Mount1 x Somate Flexible Octopus Stand Tripod1 x Somate Floation Handle Grip1 x Somate Head Belt Strap Mount1 x Somate 360 Degree Rotary Clip Mount1 x Somate Car Suction Cup Mount1 x Somate Remote Control Wrist Strap1 x Somate Selfie Stick Monopod1 x Somate Bike Handlebar Holder Mount1 x Somate Plastic Wrench2 x Somate Connections + Screws ( 1 Long + 1 Short)2 x Somate Tripod Mount Adapter2 x Somate Connections ( Long + Short )2 x Somate Helmet Extension Arm5 x Somate Curved Adhesive Pad5 x Somate Flat Adhesive Pad6 x Somate Long Crews10 x Somate Base ( 5 Curved + 5 Flat)Gift :1 x Somate Storage Fannel Bag</p>

<h5 id="the-best-bang-for-your-buck">The BEST bang for your buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This deal is OUTSTANDINGLY GREAT!For 46 pieces of quality equipment that come out to less than 50 cents each? Talk about a steal!This is a must have accessory if you own a GoPro or any type of outdoor sports camera!It uses the universal mount designed for action so you can rest assured that compatibility and realibilty will not be an issue.I was able to test out the equipment when I took a trip in the woods nearby and the accessories worked just as expected. The gorilla pod like tripod was pretty sturdy and was able to hold the GoPro while attached to a branch to get some cool shots of me playing disc golf.The floater worked flawlessly in the pond and my favorite mount suprisingly was the wrist strap mount!This company got it right when GoPros first attempt failed. This strap let&rsquo;s the camera ROTATE a full 360 degrees. Gone are the days of twisting your wrist to get the shot, you simply twist and rotate.They also included a BUNCH of sticky mounts so now you don&rsquo;t have to be scared of wasting them, you have plenty of them to mount to projects and boards and anywhere you can think of.I&rsquo;m really impressed by this company. They even included a bag to carry all of this with you! Now that&rsquo;s what I call care.I did receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest review but I absolutely loved this product. I am not affiliated with this company but man, they sure impressed me and made a very good product.</p>
