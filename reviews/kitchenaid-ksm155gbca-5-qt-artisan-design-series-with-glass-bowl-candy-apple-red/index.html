<h5 id="amazon-selling-used-refurbished-as-new">Amazon selling Used/Refurbished as New?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I speculate that Amazon is selling this KA mixer as new when it may actually be refurbished. After receiving two KA in antique copper here is why I think this:1. The first one I received has a motor issue and makes a loud grinding noise and smells like the motor is burning up. It was also missing a little paint but the antique gold color and texture were as pictured. I sent for a replacement.2. The replacement mixer, for the mixer I just discussed, is a mess! Its pieces are not put together correctly and their are large gaps between the silver metal pieces and the copper parts. It looks like it was taken apart with difficulty putting it back together.3. The replacement is a completely different color antique gold than the first one I received. The replacement is also lacking the cool texture the first one I received had. These look completely different from each other.4. The replacement had a wad of dried white goop in the glass bowl. I assume this to be a food remnant.Amazon is sending a third replacement. At this point I&rsquo;m not even sure I want this anymore. If these are not used/refurbished then KitchenAid has some terrible quality control issues that they are overlooking. This is such a shame as I have wanted one of these so badly for the past 20 years.UPDATE: The third KA mixer I received made a horrible clicking noise as if something in the inside of the machine is loose!!! This third machine is also lacking in the texture of the original machine I received! I am sending this back!! I also ordered this exact same model in the antique copper color from Macy&rsquo;s. It is perfect! It sounds normal. No grinding or clicking. It is also the correct shade of antique gold with the proper grained texture. Now I know Amazon is selling refurbished or factory seconds (the machines that didn&rsquo;t make the cut).</p>

<h5 id="lovely-to-look-at-and-it-mixes">Lovely to look at&ndash; and it mixes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, this thing makes me smile when I walk into the kitchen. I bought the metal-bowl version (KSM150) to make cookies after my hand mixer started to smoke during a particularly intense doughing session. I&rsquo;ve used it primarily for that and pizza crusts. Things that can be mixed with a handheld whisk, I opt for that instead.Do you need a stand mixer? No, probably not, but it sure takes the grunt work out of stirring and kneading. It also mixes more consistently than I could by hand and classes up the counter.If you&rsquo;re set on a stand mixer, should you buy this one? Maybe. It&rsquo;s not designed for huge amounts of heavy dough or constant use. It&rsquo;s built well, but it&rsquo;s not an industrial machine. It audibly strains with a double helping of cookie dough (around 25 oz of flour) and kneading wet, thick pizza dough. With that sort of load, there&rsquo;s no speed difference between setting 6 and 10, though of course you&rsquo;d never knead that fast anyway.KitchenAid has some mixers that are ostensibly a bit stronger. They&rsquo;re all lift-style: instead of tilting the head back, the head sits higher and you raise and lower the bowl. I prefer the tilt-head style. The paddles never get out of the way with the bowl-lift, getting the bowl to lock in place is a jerky movement, and it takes up a lot of vertical counter space. What you do get for the extra cost of the Pro series is a better dough hook, a metal gearbox, more power, and a slightly larger bowl. Even these higher-power mixers will fall short of alternatives from Bosch and Electrolux for serious breadmaking, however.If you go the other direction with the cheaper Classic Plus, you lose <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> QT of bowl capacity, a handle on the bowl, the splash guard, and color choices besides white. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s functionally identical to this model and about the same power. This mixer also came with a recipe book in addition to the splash guard. I haven&rsquo;t used either. The guard is a fiddly thing, you spill less just tilting the mixer up and dumping your ingredients in. I do think the extra <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> quart and the handle are worth something though (especially for double recipes) and could justify opting for the Artisan.This particular model has a glass bowl relative to the more popular metal style. The glass is a lot heavier and less durable, but it does have measuring units and a pouring spout. The translucency solves a problem that really isn&rsquo;t a problem. Likewise, for measuring, I have my metal bowl on top of a kitchen scale because doughs turn out more consistent if I go by ounces instead of volume. Different recipes may benefit more.There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about Hobart units. Prior to about 1985, these mixers were made by Hobart, a supplier of industrial kitchen equipment. Later models are made by Whirlpool. There&rsquo;s some debate whether the new models are as good as the old ones, particularly in regard to the gearbox. My take is that if you can find an old Hobart (e.g., K4SS, K5-A, K5SS with a metal &lsquo;Hobart&rsquo; placard) and it runs well, it&rsquo;s likely to keep running well no matter what you throw at it. But it won&rsquo;t be as clean and may not fit certain new bowls, paddles, or attachments.New or old, these KitchenAid mixers are dead-simple to repair. The motor brushes are replaceable without dismantling the unit ($10 or so and hidden beneath the black circular covers), the speed governor is mechanically adjustable, and the gearbox is straightforward and easily accessible. This means that they&rsquo;re intriguing on the used market. People receive them as gifts and put them in the local classifieds with minimal use or minor flaws you can fix. Typical transaction prices are $125-$175, and I&rsquo;ve seen this mixer as low as $75. For new units, Kohls has them on sale quite often.Here&rsquo;s the full list of KA mixers (updated December 2016):KSM3311X - Artisan Mini* Tilt-head, 250W, 3.5QT metal, soft-startK45SS - Classic* Tilt-head, 250W, 4.5QT metalKSM75 - Classic Plus* Tilt-head, 275W, 4.5QT metalKSM95 - Ultra Power* Tilt-head, 300W, 4.5QT metalKSM96 - Ultra Power Plus* Tilt-head, 300W, 4.5QT metal handle, pouring shieldKSM150 - Artisan / Architect* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shieldKSM153 - Artistan Flex* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, flex beaterKSM155 - Artisan Design* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handleKSM160PS - Ultra Power* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handle, 3QT metal, pouring shieldKSM160APS - Architect* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, 3QT metal, pouring shieldKSM500 - Pro 500* Bowl-lift, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffRKG25H0X - Heavy Duty* Bowl-lift, 450W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKV25G0X - Pro 5* Bowl-life, 450W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKP26M1X - Pro 600* Bowl-lift, 575W, 6QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKF2622 - Pro 600 Design* Bowl-lift, 575W, 6QT glass handle, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKSM6521X - Pro 6500* Bowl-lift, 750W, 6QT glass handle, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffKSM7586P - Pro Line* Bowl-lift, 975W, 7QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffKSM8990 - NSF Certified* Bowl-lift, 975W, 8QT metal handle, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffKSMC895 - NSF Certified* Bowl-lift, 975W, 8QT metal handle, bowl guard, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffIf you&rsquo;d rather have a more powerful bowl lift mixer, KitchenAid&rsquo;s refurbished store often has the Heavy Duty Series for as little as $175 (if you Google a coupon code). It&rsquo;s a doppelganger for the Pro 5 and includes the superior spiral dough hook. Whatever you buy, try to have it on (even with an empty bowl) for a few minutes at least once a week or two. The oil-leak problem occurs when the oil breaks down from disuse. If the mixer runs with any frequency, you&rsquo;ll never encounter it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used my mixer for making everything from pizza crust to various breads. It has worked wonderfully. It seems to have plenty of power without being too loud. It is pretty heavy if you have to move it around. This is one of my better kitchen purchases in recent years. I am starting to look at attachments for it so I can use it for more than just getting my dough ready.</p>

<h5 id="what-s-up-with-the-quality-control-on-the-finish">What&rsquo;s up with the quality control on the finish?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to question quality control on these mixers. I originally ordered one from a different site and it came with a gouge on the base and missing paint. Thinking it was a fluke, I returned it and ordered this one from Amazon because of a shorter delivery time. My husband unpacked this one and we found this one also had missing paint (this time where the top and the base come together. If this was a cheap thing, I&rsquo;d probably shrug it off &hellip; but at this price point it shouldn&rsquo;t arrive looking used. What gives? This one is going back, too, in the hopes the replacement that comes isn&rsquo;t blemished. Hubby&rsquo;s looking pretty miserable trying to fit it all back into the box. I&rsquo;m going to owe him a shoulder rub after this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-great">Looks great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for the MT house, so it doesn&rsquo;t get the workout my KA ProSeries goes through. The color is gorgeous, everything works as it&rsquo;s supposed to, but it does have some issues. The dough hook, paddle, and whisk attachments are flimsier than what I was expecting: I ended up ordering new ones directly from KA to replace them. Also, in retrospect, I would not have gotten the glass bowl. It looks pretty, but doesn&rsquo;t feel securely attached to the base. In addition, it doesn&rsquo;t work well with the pouring shield. You can order a metal replacement bowl from KA, as well.Not bad, overall. It does look fantastic.</p>
