<h5 id="trick-to-get-it-to-work-properly-with-the-iphone">Trick to get it to work properly with the iPhone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I spent a couple of frustrating days trying to keep a connection long enough to transfer a photo and was about to give up and send it back when I happened upon an idea I should have thought of myself. Credit goes to a user who posted on the Nikon site.You don&rsquo;t need to mess with all the network settings in the app - you can if you like, but it is not necessary. The trick to get a reliable connection is to put your iPhone into airplane mode (thereby eliminating all forms of potential network interference) and then enable ONLY the wifi connection to the camera. Do this and everything will work just fine. When you are done, simply disable airplane mode and all your original settings will be in place again and you can go on your merry way.As for all the other network settings in the app:Renaming the network is probably smart if you don&rsquo;t want to advertise that you have an expensive Nikon in the vicinity. Password protecting the network may be overkill, but it can&rsquo;t hurt. You really don&rsquo;t need to touch anything else.</p>

<h5 id="hard-to-get-started-but-smooth-sailing-afterward">Hard to get started, but smooth sailing afterward.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving this four stars because there was a serious lack of instruction on how to use this thing. I had to hit the internet and hunt down forums and ultimately watch a you tube video for a different model of camera to figure out how to pair this thing and get it to work. Perhaps it was due to my lack of research, but I was hoping to use this to attach directly to my computer, and was therefore disappointed to find out it had to attach to a tablet or smart phone as an intermediate step, then I had to send the pictures to my computer from my phone. I wish there was a desktop app. That being said, once I figured it out, it runs pretty well. I liked that remote feature, I hadn&rsquo;t expected that, and it&rsquo;s sort of a cool feature. I actually bought this at the same time as the physical remote, had I been aware this could utilize my tablet or smart phone as a remote, I may have saved a few dollars and some camera bag space by just buying this one item. Oh well.</p>

<h5 id="keeps-turning-off-freezes-p530-seller-will-give-refund">Keeps turning off. Freezes P530.Seller will give refund.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really looking forward to using this when I travel to move photos to my iPhone so I won&rsquo;t have to lug a netbook with me because I need to travel as lightly as possible. So, after seeing the great reviews, I bought it. Well, despite all the great reviews, mine is not working. I down loaded the multipage instruction pdf from Nikon and followed the instructions. I got it set up with no problem. It downloaded photos to my 4S with no problem. It took photos with no problem. HOWEVER it keeps disconnecting itself. To reconnect, I have to shut everything off and start everything over again. Finally it disconnected itself right in the middle of taking a photo. At that point, it froze the app and my P530. Because it froze the camera, I am sure this is a device problem and not a problem with my 4S. I couldn&rsquo;t even shut the camera off. I had to remove the battery from the camera to make it reset. I am soooooo disappointed. I called Nikon customer support. They suggested I use airplane mode. Gave it a try, but was only able to download one photo before it turned off. Cantacted the seller. They said because I had it less than 30 days, they will give a refund. I&rsquo;m really disappointed because this would have been a gizmo to travel with. Maybe I just got a lemon.</p>

<h5 id="it-works-with-my-d3200-and-ipad-iphone-finally">It works with my D3200 and iPad/iPhone. Finally</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok I FINALLY hooked up my WU-1a adapter with my new iPad Air 2 and finally my iPhone.One major problem for me was finding the app. It was like an app conspiracy. Before boxing up for return, I found a Nikon link on another help forum and went for it.[&hellip;]/wireless-mobile-utility/id554157010?mt=8The frustration mounted. But everywhere I read how users liked the device and I was determined to make it work. For some reason, certainly not due to my expertise, it paired with my iPad.After installing the app, inserting the adapter and turning on the camera, the trick was to go to Settings&gt;WiFi and choose Nikon_WU_227&hellip; as the Network (not your normal Wifi modem setting). I had to constantly switch the Wifi setting from my modem to the &ldquo;Nikon Wu_227&hellip;&ldquo;. I pressed the little button on the adapter several times, holding it down until it flashed red and green, then back to green flashing.ONE THING I DID AFTER A WHILE WAS OPEN THE APP CLICK THE LITTLE ANTENNA ICON.I became engrossed in another project having given up on the adapter as a dud THEN lo and behold the green light was solid green. I had done it! And it worked like I had seen on YouTube.My advice would be just to hang in there like a hair in a biscuit and soon you too will be remotely transferring photos. Be sure you have a full battery when you start.READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, WATCH A VIDEO OR TWO ABOUT IT. GO FOR IT&hellip;.GO FOR IT AGAIN and keep breakable objects out of reach.</p>

<h5 id="it-works">It works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works for me with advice I took from other reviews. It just seems odd that Nikon wouldn&rsquo;t have made this built into the camera. I thought I had gotten a camera with this built in but apparently not. The app that goes along could use a refreshed look. But it does what it needs to do. I use it to get photos off my camera onto my phone so I can get them emailed or shared on social media. I like it because the SD card has way more space for ALL the photos and and I transfer my best shots for instant sharing. Great for travel days when I&rsquo;m not tugging a laptop all over.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-neat-storage-i-wasn-t-expecting">so far so good - neat storage I wasn&rsquo;t expecting!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good! I haven&rsquo;t used it in its full capacity yet, but played around with it and didn&rsquo;t have problems with speed. Only quirk I&rsquo;ve found is that the flash automatically pops up when you try to take a picture through the app. The cool thing that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting: it comes with a handy little case that attaches to the camera strap so that you don&rsquo;t risk losing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="was-free-so-i-can-t-complain">Was free so I can&rsquo;t complain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This basically came free with the camera purchase so I&rsquo;m not one to complain. Does what it is supposed to. Very tiny. Even with the case I could see myself losing this.</p>
