<h5 id="very-effective-at-blocking-sound-comfy-and-durable-but-watch-for-wax">Very effective at blocking sound, comfy, and durable&ndash;but watch for wax</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these to replace the silicone buds on a set of Symphonized earbuds (which are cheap but sound surprisingly good for the price). I&rsquo;m not one of those people who always complain about silicone tips and how they don&rsquo;t fit, for whatever reason I was blessed with the proper shape of ear so that most of the time silicone works fine. The Symphonized set though was always loose for me, so I tried these. I was skeptical that they would keep their springiness over time, but so far after a few months they are still just as springy as they were originally. They really do work great. Takes a couple extra seconds to squish them properly in your fingers before putting them in your ears, but that&rsquo;s it. My only complaint is that they do slowly collect ear wax on the exterior that, because of the texture is just impossible to get off by conventional means. So your friends probably won&rsquo;t want to share them with you after awhile.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-say-enough-good-things-about-these">Can&rsquo;t say enough good things about these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say enough good things about these. This is my second set of the &ldquo;Isolation&rdquo; series which are super comfortable and really enhance the sound of my Jaybird bluetooth earbuds. They definitely don&rsquo;t eliminate any ambient noise but they help seal your ear canal (which really helps with sound quality) and keep the earbuds in place comfortably. I didn&rsquo;t need the wax guard version as my earbuds have a porous screen built in. They def help my wireless earbuds sound very close to wired quality.Couple hints from experience&hellip; you&rsquo;re most likely going to have to use some force to get these on&hellip; don&rsquo;t be afraid to deform the tip&hellip; it will come back to life after a couple minutes. I was a bit concerned that I damaged mine the first time. Second, buy the multipack to start. I was surprised to find that I needed the large size&hellip; I never would have guessed that. Sucks that you most likely have 2 throwaway sizes but its cheaper in the long run. I got almost a year out of one pair, although admittedly I should have replaced them a few months back. They start to lose their rigidity so they don&rsquo;t seal as well (plus they look gross).I personally think the wax guard is a gimmick and not worth the extra money. Have you really damaged a pair of earbuds from excess wax? If so you might be overly gross.Once you buy these and replace your worthless rubber tips, you&rsquo;ll never go back. I promise</p>

<h5 id="best-ear-tip-replacements">Best Ear Tip Replacements</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best ear tips I have found!! This is a great replacement tips for any head set. I workout 6 days a week and do not like talking to people in the gym or hearing others and these keep all sounds out of the room and keeps me focused. They are extremely comfortable and sweat proof, they keep the buds in place so while I am doing a HIIT they do not fall out and I can stay focused!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-and-durable">Comfortable and durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these foam earbud tips for use with my Jaybird Bluebuds X as well as a pair of Vmoda headphones. While they are a tight fit to install on my Bluebuds, they slipped onto my Vmoda headphones with ease. The inside of the earbuds is a rubbery tube to attach them to your headphones and keep them from sliding off. This package comes with three sizes of foam tips: small, medium, and large. Both the small and medium tips fit into my ear canal nicely without falling out or being uncomfortable.To insert the headphones, I gently roll them with my fingertips so the foam will expand in my ear creating a secure seal. The tips are soft and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, including during workouts. So far I have used these for approximately three months without any damage from daily use (or sweat). For in ear headphones, these do provide quite a bit of noise isolation though this was not an essential factor for my purposes. I will purchase these again if they do wear out because they are a good value and quality.</p>

<h5 id="will-fit-onto-the-jaybird-x2-but-not-without-effort-due-to-smaller-inner-core-diameter">Will fit onto the Jaybird X2 but not without effort due to smaller inner core diameter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Specific to fitment on Jaybird X2-I own the Jaybird X2 blue tooth ear buds and found the included ear tips (silicone SML kit, and Comply Sport SML kit) did not isolate for best bass response. So I ordered a set of these Comply 500 Isolation tips. Here is my experience so far:Sound isolation - much better than the Comply SportFit in my ear - better than the sport but still not what I need. When I start exercising I am constantly having to push these back into my ear to get bass response. I think this is due to the shape. I tried over and over swapping between all the different tips, silicone, foam and different brands as I also purchased a set of Rebound foam tips. I also have tried the more rounded Comply tips (200 model ) on my wired SOny earbuds but those do not fit well. Perhaps I just have unusual ear canal form. Of all the tips, the Comply 500 isolation in medium seem to come closest but still fall out of my ears as I exercise.However here is where I really take issue with these aftermarket tips for fitment onto the Jaybird X2: The Comply 500 says on the package it works with Jaybird but I found they require some effort to install. Using a digital caliper I measured the Jaybird x2 port and the inner core of each ear tip:Jaybird X2 port (or whatever it is called) = 6.5mmComply Sport tips SML kit (included with Jaybirds) = 5.5 mmComply Isolation 500 SML aftermarket kit = 5mmSo the Comply sport tip sizing is better and so I take issue with being unable to find for order additional Comply tips in the Isolation model that are 5.5 mm to fit onto the Jaybirds. Perhaps with the popularity of the Jaybirds, Amazon or Comply or Logitech would see fit to make available an isolation version with 5.5mm inner core tips to address the difficulty of installation onto the 6.5mm Jaybird X2 port.</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-the-best">Absolutely the best!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great! superior isolation and comfort compared to the old tips that comes with my Jaybirds. The old Jaybirds tips would make my ears hurt having it on for a while, but no problems with these comply tips. The comply tips are made out of foam as appose silicon; thereby, it better conforms with your ear canal and blocks sound from going in and out.. Note holes to install the comply are a little smaller than the factory Jaybirds tip so It will be a little hard to get them on, but once you got it on it is night and day difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love them, they change completely the quality of the sound compared to stock buds</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-good-isolation">Comfortable, good isolation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: Comfortable, good isolation, grey color is suitable for white earbuds, tight and didn&rsquo;t loosen.Cons: Last only 3–6 months of almost daily use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-jaybirds-and-really-stay-in-place">Great for JayBirds and really stay in place</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned some JayBirds for over 2 years and really hated the original ear plugs that came with them because they kept falling out on long runs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-white-color-becomes-kinda-gross-looking-after-a-while">The white color becomes kinda gross looking after a while &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The white color becomes kinda gross looking after a while. The buds work really well, but a darker color would have been a smarter purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great replacements</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-re-great-i-use-them-for-several-hours-every-day">They&rsquo;re great! I use them for several hours every day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what you&rsquo;d expect. The foam breaks down after a while, but I&rsquo;ve happily re-ordered several times now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-fit">Does not fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>went to their website to make sure I bought the correct ones for my headphones and they do not fit. Not even close. Very upset.</p>

<p>PRO: With regards to comfort and noise isolation, this does the job and does it quite well. Best upgrade.CON: I have a MEelectronic A151.</p>
