<h5 id="a-worry-free-chromebook">A worry-free Chromebook</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Chromebook hardly needs another review but I&rsquo;ve just been so happy with it lately I thought I&rsquo;d throw my two cents in here. <em>For a Chromebook</em> this device is fantastic. Of course it&rsquo;s limited in many, many ways, but that&rsquo;s the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I&rsquo;ve been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It&rsquo;s worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible.Pros:Very sturdy - I&rsquo;ve dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it&rsquo;s back in place. It&rsquo;s great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it.Fantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying.Great battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out.Good sunlight readability - The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare.Cons:Weight - Though it&rsquo;s not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it&rsquo;s not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is.Sometime slow - As you&rsquo;d expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them.All in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a chromebook fan for years. Because we travel a lot I wanted a more ruggedized model. I&rsquo;m more than happy with this device. And the battery has been lasting for a full 10 hours. Very impressive.</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-money">Worth the Money</h5>

<p>This little Chromebook is the best computer I have had in awhile. Setup is super easy and it runs incredibly fast. Many other computers take at least 2-3 minutes before I can do anything with them, but not this one! I can immediately get online and access documents without waiting or getting frustrated.The speakers are pretty good for the size of the computer, nothing super loud or anything, but definitely good and clear sound.The keyboard&rsquo;s letters are a light blue color and bigger than most other&rsquo;s. That does not make a very big difference to me, but it would help someone just learning how to use a keyboard or whose vision is not too great.I personally am not a huge fan of the touch pad because most of the time it is difficult or impossible to left click anything, but that was easily solvable by using a small, portable wireless mouse.It does effortlessly keep track of social media notifications, especially Facebook, which is a good but not overall necessary feature, at least for me.It has a good design and definitely would hold up to short distance drops or a little bit of water. I often take this to school and at times it sits in my hot car, but it always manages to work great when in use.My favorite feature of this computer? The battery life. Hands down, the battery life on its own is unbeatable. It lasts at the very least ten hours and I can get anywhere from 3-5 days use on one charge. I no longer need to take my charger out with me and worry whether or not there is an outlet nearby.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-portable-computer-for-the-price">A Great Portable Computer for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I suppose I&rsquo;m not super computer savvy but I spend a lot of time on computers and I know what I like. My wife and I own a Dell desk top computer which we share between the two of us. I&rsquo;ll be going back to school in the spring and we thought it might be nice to have an extra computer around the house so we could both work on projects, or watch videos, or whatever at the same time. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of money to spend so I really did my research before purchasing.I spent less than $200 for this little Chromebook and I think I really got my money&rsquo;s worth. With the exception of the storage capacity (which can be easily upgraded with an SD Card), it seems to be on a par with MacBook Air but for less than a third the cost. It&rsquo;s fast, easy to use, light weight, and durable. The last two qualities are especially important to me because I&rsquo;m a cyclist and a strap hanger. If you travel primarily by automobile, you can&rsquo;t fully grok how important it is for someone who travels primarily by bicycle and/or bus to pack light and have durable, water resistant gear. It isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the product description, but I was pleasantly surprised that this Chromebook came with a 12 month accident protection warranty. To me that says a lot about Asus&rsquo; confidence in the durability of their product.Admittedly, I am a big time Google user. I&rsquo;ve had a gmail account for years and I use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you&rsquo;re like me in this you&rsquo;ll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience.One thing I would strongly recommend to anyone who decides to purchase this product is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It&rsquo;s very intuitive and user friendly but you&rsquo;ll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it.All in all, I think this is an extraordinary product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, very portable computer for school or work. In fact, we liked it so much, we bought a second one for my wife. :-)</p>
