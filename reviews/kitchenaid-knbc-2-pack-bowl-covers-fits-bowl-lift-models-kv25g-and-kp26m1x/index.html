<h5 id="perfect-perfect-perfect">Perfect, perfect, perfect:)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are GREAT! I wish I had these years ago. They fit perfectly and snug on my mixing bowl. I have the kitchen aid artisan model. These are nice to cover your bowl when it is not in use and you can even seal the bowl with your beater, whip, and dough hook inside to keep the dust out of your bowl and off your attachments. Another super plus thing that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting is that the lid also fits perfectly on my large Pyrex mixing bowl so if I was making two recipes of cookies like I usually do, I can cover and refrigerate both bowls while waiting to roll the dough. I am ordering a set for my daughter.</p>

<h5 id="very-important-details-about-these-covers">Very Important Details About These Covers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t personally own this particular item which is model *<strong><em>KBC90N</em></strong>*, but having recently purchased KitchenAid KP26M1PSL Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, Silver for my fiance, I knew that getting accessories for the mixer was a must to get the most out of our mixer. Anyone who is familiar with KitchenAid products know that they have numerous different types of mixers. That&rsquo;s one beef I have with KitchenAid, make your product accessories a little bit easier to understand without having to go through research mode like you&rsquo;re studying for some kind of final exam that counts for 90% of your grade&hellip; but I digress.Being research-oriented for nearly everything I buy, I had to make sure all the accesssories I purchased fit/match the mixer I own. With that said, I checked with KA Online Help as well as that nifty accordian-folded accessories booklet that came with my mixer to get my information.The covers that I have are model &ldquo;KNBC&rdquo; (KitchenAid 2 Pack Mixer Bowl Cover). These do fit my KA Pro 600 mixer rather snug and nicely. From what KA support told me, all their covers are not sealing (meaning air can get in &amp; out of your bowl even with the cover on). Obviously these are ideal for mixing stuff that needs to sit for a period of time, such as bread but even works for &ldquo;saving&rdquo; batter such as cake/cupcake batter for a later use. Much more convenient than using saran wrap or a cloth for covering.From my research, here is what I found. KitchenAid makes THREE different types of bowl covers for their current line of mixers&hellip; obviously for their 50 gajillion models they have out in the world. I would highly advise you use this guide to make sure you don&rsquo;t have to go through the hassle of returning them&hellip; because everyone hates returns. It&rsquo;s an inconvenience! I&rsquo;ve even included a link to the product for each bowl cover model for convenience.KNBC KitchenAid 2 Pack Mixer Bowl Cover - Fits models that start with KV, KT, KD, KB and KP <strong>5 quart wide bowl</strong> (NOT REGULAR 5 QT BOWL) and 6 quart Bowl Lift models.KBC5N KitchenAid KBC5N Mixer Bowl Covers for 5-Quart Stand Mixer Bowls, Set of 2 - Fits models K5, KP50 and KSM5.KBC90N KitchenAid KBC90N Mixer Bowl Covers for Pivot Head Stand Mixer Bowls, Set of 2 - Fits Models K45, K45SS, KSM75, KSM90, KSM95, KSM100, KSM103, KSM110.Hope this helps!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this pair of KitchenAid bowl covers from Amazon a few years ago for $5.99 (with no shipping cost since I have Amazon Prime), but even at the current price of $9.99, I would consider them a good deal. I know they&rsquo;ve already saved me far more than that in aluminum foil and plastic wrap, which I try to avoid using anyway for environmental reasons. I had to really search to find them at that price, though. Even Amazon offers them at many different prices, up to $17.54 for exactly the same thing, so shop around.I use my KitchenAid bowls for letting bread dough rise and for temporary food storage, so the covers will get a lot of use. I also like using one as a dust cover for my mixer, so I don&rsquo;t have to wash the bowl and the attachment that I store inside each time I use them.These covers come in three different sizes, so double-check your mixer model before ordering. I have 2 4.5-quart bowls and 1 3-quart bowl for my K45 mixer. (I got the extra bowls dirt-cheap on eBay - don&rsquo;t pay list for those either!) Because the diameters of the 4.5- and 3-quart bowls are the same, my covers fit both bowl sizes. KitchenAid describes the covers as &ldquo;nonsealing&rdquo;, so I was afraid that they wouldn&rsquo;t fit tightly enough for my purposes, but they&rsquo;re fine.I usually wash these by hand because I don&rsquo;t run my dishwasher every day, but I have washed them successfully in the top dishwasher rack, which is safe according to the package and product description. Since I have a KitchenAid dishwasher, KitchenAid will certainly hear from me if I ever have a problem.</p>

<h5 id="they-don-t-stay-on-well-in-the-fridge">They don&rsquo;t stay on well in the fridge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t terrible but if I could do it again, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy them.I bought these mostly so I could just put a lid on a mixing bowl and put it right in the refrigerator, without transferring whatever I made into another container. The problem is that the lids shrink a bit when refrigerated, which sometimes causes them to come off all by themselves.You can also use these to keep dust out of your bowls when not in use. My lids are solid with an indent in the top (not a hole as pictured) to make room for the mixer&rsquo;s shaft. I used to store three heads (paddle, whisk and dough hook) in the bowl when not in use but they won&rsquo;t fit with the lid on. It&rsquo;s a close fit with just two.Save your money. Scoop whatever you&rsquo;re making into a proper storage container when you&rsquo;re done and clean your bowls before use if they need it. If they&rsquo;re going unused that long, it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;ll have to do that often. :)</p>

<h5 id="fits-new-5-quart-artisan-models-ksm150-perfectly">Fits New 5 Quart Artisan Models KSM150 Perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are looking for the lid (er - mixer bowl cover) that fits new 5 Quart colored artisan KitchenAids, this is it! This lid fits my bowl perfectly. The lid says non-sealing, but this is close to air tight. For example, when I proof bread dough in it the lids bows up due to the increased pressure inside.Couldn&rsquo;t be happier. No more plastic wrap.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-fit-ksm155-5qt-tilt-head-glass-bowl">Does not fit KSM155 5qt Tilt Head Glass Bowl</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the written description on both Amazon and KitchenAid&rsquo;s official website, this does NOT fit the KSM155 model with the glass bowl. The actual packaging makes zero mentioning of my mixer&rsquo;s model, so I&rsquo;m at a loss as to why it&rsquo;s included in the website&rsquo;s list. I&rsquo;m back to square one trying to find a storage option for the attachments, and angry that I&rsquo;m out money when this was not my fault.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are awesome. I use one as a cover and the other I cut the middle out of and use as a flour guard (since the actual kitchenaid flour guard with chute is useless).</p>
