<h5 id="i-got-the-real-one-and-this-one-to-compare-there-s-no-comparison">I got the real one and this one to compare, there&rsquo;s no comparison</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Straight out of the box there are instructions&hellip; I recognized them, they are the same instructions that came with my antsy lab fidget cube, word for word. (don&rsquo;t be surprised when the instructions are actually legible, they are copied from the real cube)A) the instructions say three buttons click and two dont (like in the real cube) problem is they all clickB) on the instructions it says the ball clicks as well, it doesn&rsquo;t. The gears barely move, and they are barely sticking out so it&rsquo;s hard to get traction on them.C) the glide is a far far cry from the legitimate cube, it&rsquo;s just a wobbly disk on a stick&hellip; This one DOES click, unlike the real one (it shouldn&rsquo;t)D) the worry Stone is a joke, it&rsquo;s practically not there, very slight indentation, unlike the real oneE) the spin seems to be working so far, albeit not as smoothly as the real one.F) now the flip switch, the switch is the only part which I might like more than the original, the original cubes switch is too easy to flip&hellip; There&rsquo;s almost no click, this one has a click (albeit very very loud) and it feels like you&rsquo;re flipping a switchIn all the real one looks a lot more compact this one looks bulky, especially with the wobbly glide.Still won&rsquo;t get an extra star for the flip since this is a horribly done knockoff which dosn&rsquo;t deserve a second of your time!</p>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really cool product! The material looks very durable, and doesnâ€™t feel like it will break like the others. This is the 3rdÂ Â cube I bought on amazon, and the quality is far better than the other ones. I highly suggest anyone to buy this FOCUS CUBE brand instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-this-is-not-the-original-antsy-lab-fidget-cube-but-this-is-the-next-best-thing-it-came-in-a-nice-little-box">No this is not the original Antsy Lab fidget cube but this is the next best thing. It came in a nice little box &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll save you guys the trouble from buying from all the other cheap knock offs on Amazon. No this is not the original Antsy Lab fidget cube but this is the next best thing. It came in a nice little box with their logo on it. Very impressed with the quality. A+</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-anxious-student-or-person">For the anxious student or person.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so I ordered two of these each from a different distributor. I absolutely love this cube over the other one, because the silver soothe ball also clicks when pushed. That&rsquo;s like one of my biggest fidgeting things. I like to click things. The only downfall with this one is the toggle doesn&rsquo;t click like the other one does. My only other issue is the price, if it was $9 or so I would buy 3 more. The other product was a lot cheaper and is roughly the same minus the clicky soothe ball. I take this thing to class use it when I drive and it keeps me from picking up my phone and helps my ADHD and anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-hate-it-so-i-got-her-one-of-these">I hate it. So I got her one of these &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this Focus Cube because my girlfriend drives me insane when she is trying to concentrate. She likes to make clicking noises with her nails&hellip; I hate it. So I got her one of these and it do not work well. The buttons do not push in, the silver ball does not spin and the circular plate on the back does not spin very well either. I ordered one on Ebay for one dollar and it is ten times better than this one. Save your money and find them elsewhere. Also this one is TINY. The only reason that I gave it two stars is because it stops her from clicking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-not-authentic">Great but not authentic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It ships from China so I got it in about 3 weeks.It is obviously a knock off of the one that had a kickstarter for it, but at the price I thought it would be worth it. I love it so much, but my only complaint is that all the buttons (beside the silver ball) have sound, so I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it around other people. I have ADHD and it works great for me when I am doing homework, reading, ect alone. The loudest noise is similar to clicking a pen, but there are some that are quieter than that. I would definitely recommend it, but if its for a child in school, it would be better to get the silent version (I&rsquo;ve heard the authentic is silent).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-a-must-buy">Amazing, a must buy !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have just gotten it today, I got the gray with black one and honestly I was expecting it to be really bad but it was so nice, it was in a beautiful box and just by holding it you can tell it&rsquo;s the real thing, it was so worth it considering the price I paid for it and I am absoluty exstatic about it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-satisfied">Overall satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It helps calm me by providing idle distractions at times and helps me focus at other times, still surprising how a little plastic bobble can have such an effect. That being said, delivery was on time, 2 of the 5 buttons don&rsquo;t click. The 3 gear wheels spin without resistance tho that is much preferred to the on that a friend received that the gears are practically too stiff to turn. Would have loved ro have a purple color option. The switch works fine, but the clicking drives my dog crazy, not a product flaw just kinda funny lol. Overall satisfied with the purchase</p>
