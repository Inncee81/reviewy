<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="i-am-very-pleased-with-them">I am very pleased with them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to take my workouts up a notch by incorporating High Intensity Interval Training sequences. However all the routines seem to require all kinds of jumping around. Being a mature gentleman with two surgically repaired knees, that was simply a non-starter. Enter the HomeGym 4U Gliding Discs. I use them in all my home workouts. They are fabulous. As advertised, they work on either wood or carpeted floors. Just a two minute set utilizing them for three different movements leaves me breathless. I am very pleased with them.They will be accompanying me on all my travels both for business and for vacation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-will-feel-so-out-of-shape-using-these-but-i-love-knowing-that-there-is-a-challenge">You will feel so out of shape using these but I love knowing that there is a challenge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These gliding discs are a mixture of amazing/devil. You will feel so out of shape using these but I love knowing that there is a challenge.I haven&rsquo;t had any issues on the carpet but haven&rsquo;t tried them on hard floors.If you are looking to mix things up a bit, try these out! I think they&rsquo;re worth the money!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are fun as playing with a toy as a kid. I have used them every day since I got them. Seriously, you could lie flat and still work your extremities and increase heartbeat and work muscles you forgot you had. I like the mountain climbers and I can do them without hurting my knees. I already feel an increase in strength, flexibility and endurance. I will have to work up to the example exercises included. It&rsquo;s doing my body good as is though and it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="customer-service-is-excellent">Customer service is excellent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought several other pieces of exercise equipment and I haven&rsquo;t used them much yet, so I&rsquo;m posting only 4 stars. But did try them out on both my hardwood floor and carpet and really like the way they engage your muscles, and they seem good quality. I have some arthritis in my wrists, so I&rsquo;m not sure I can use them for anything other than lower body. The customer service is excellent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-how-these-are-capable-on-different-floor-surfaces">I like how these are capable on different floor surfaces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like how these are capable on different floor surfaces. Super convenient for exercise. If you&rsquo;re just starting off using gliders, I&rsquo;d start off slow and work your way into a full stretcharge, the enclosed suggested workouts is also a nice addition with the gliders.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-addition-to-workout-routine">Excellent addition to workout routine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These gliding discs are a great way to push yourself further when working out. I have had them for about three weeks and have found them to be very efficient in helping me build on my regular routine. I&rsquo;ve also felt the effects post-workout of the discs. I know another review mentions a lack of instructions, but HomeGym 4U has excellent customer service and is extremely approachable for help. Not long after ordering the discs, I received an email thanking me for my purchase and telling me to reply directly if I had any questions. I did have a minor concern, but the concern was addressed immediately and taken care of with ease.One caveat: If you are not sure how to use the discs, please either look online or email the company for a prompt response. The discs have different finishes on opposite sides. One side is very smooth and plastic-like, while the other side is more of a fabric material. The discs are created like this so that you can use them regardless of what type of floor you have wherever you are working out. One side is meant for carpeted flooring while the other is meant for harder finishes. I use the fabric-like sides of the discs on laminate flooring with no scratches to the floor or discs. If you use the wrong side on your surface, you may wind up with scratches to your floor and/or the discs as one reviewer mentioned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-size-sturdy-quality">Perfect size. Sturdy quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I was looking for. Perfect size. Sturdy quality. Love that it&rsquo;s hard on one side and foam on the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-gliding">Good gliding</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are exactly what they are advertised as. I was happy with the quality and I use them frequently. The bottoms seem to get scratched up after being used on some surfaces, but they still glide and they don&rsquo;t do damage to my wood or laminate floors.</p>
</blockquote>
