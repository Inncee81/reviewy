<blockquote>
<p>I have used manual toothbrushes all my life. For a brief 3 months, I tried a battery powered Oral-B toothbrush but I was not very pleased with the result (it was definitely better than manual) but I hated the need to discard the entire product once the head started showing signs of wear. I decided to try an electric rechargeable brush with replaceable heads and found this product - it had great reviews and seemed like good value for money. This product thus became my first ever electric toothbrush.Now for the weak hearted - this thing fires up like a RAM truck. The Braun motor works very good with a manageable noise level and it spins the head very fast. If you switch it on before putting it in your mouth, it might spatter the toothpaste around - be careful about that. For people with sensitive gums, please consider carefully.Here is what I like and slightly dislike about this toothbrush.LIKE&ndash; My dentist is pleased with the condition of my teeth. This brush cleans my mouth real good. I can visibly see the difference.&ndash; It has flossy bits in the head of brush that do a pretty good job. It does not hurt or irritate my gums whatsoever. But, this is no replacement for actual flossing and that should always be a part of a good oral regimen no matter what brush you use.&ndash; The rubber grip on the brush is good and it remains firmly in the hand.&ndash; One time charge is good for a week&rsquo;s use at least. The charger is easy and convenient to use.&ndash; The cleaning effect is almost professional like.&ndash; I got a spare head with the brush. I am good for at least 6 months.WHAT I DESIRE IT HAD&ndash; An indicator for low battery or charge status. Towards the end of the week, I can see the motor is not running to full speeds. When the battery is gone, the brush just dies. It can happen in the middle of brushing!&ndash; The plastic cover on the packaging almost cut me. It was extremely difficult to get the brush and other components out of the plastic case. I wish it was more convenient.CONCLUSIONThis brush is no replacement for actual flossing. It runs solid and is almost like a deep clean; hence it might not be suited for everyone. CHECK WITH YOUR DENTIST BEFORE USING IT. I personally am very pleased with the effects it has had on my teeth.If I helped, let me know. Feel free to ask me questions about my experience with the product.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-but-rechargeable-battery-lasted-less-than-a-year">Works Well but Rechargeable Battery Lasted Less than a Year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought it for my daughter and she likes it. The timer is helpful in terms of extending her brushing time beyond a manual brush, and used properly it puts less pressure and force on the gums than a manual brush. I like the fact that it uses the same replacement brush heads as my Braun Professional model. The downside is that the rechargeable battery appears to have died after 11 months of use, and it is not replaceable. That seems too short of a life. Given the cost of brush heads, there is no savings using this versus a manual toothbrush. However, given that my daughter likes it and is brushing appropriately and effectively with it, we will buy another and hope that the short rechargeable battery life of the first one was an exception.</p>

<h5 id="great-electric-toothbrush-for-the-price">Great electric toothbrush for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before I found this toothbrush, I was never able to justify spending money on an electric toothbrush, since all of them were so expensive. Sure, I&rsquo;ll need to replace the heads down the line, but the brushing that this toothbrush offers is considerably better than what I can do on my own by hand, even with a nice toothbrush.The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable electric toothbrush is good for the price - it&rsquo;s a budget electric toothbrush with most of the main benefits of having an electric toothbrush. It&rsquo;s rechargeable, the brush head is small (a little larger than a tooth) and wiggles from side to side (so you can get everywhere around each tooth), and feels a lot like when you go to the dentist and they brush your teeth with the little toothbrush thingy. While I can&rsquo;t really say much about the &ldquo;Floss Action&rdquo; benefits (given that it&rsquo;s literally just a brush head, and it doesn&rsquo;t go between your teeth or anything), the brush itself is great for its price, and is a fantastic way to improve your oral care without spending a ridiculous amount of money.</p>

<h5 id="poorly-designed-product">Poorly designed product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very loud and vibrates strongly. Will rattle your jaw. Cleans OK at best. The round head is fairly large, too. Better to spend more money and get something that&rsquo;s not such a compromise. Regret buying it.</p>

<h5 id="from-one-hard-brusher-to-another-just-buy-this-toothbrush">From one hard brusher to another&hellip;..Just buy this toothbrush! :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My dentist told me I brush too hard (regular tooth brush) and recommended that I purchase an electric toothbrush. I did TONS and TONS of back and forth on which to buy (timer, no timer, sensor, supper floss mega action tilt mega spin&hellip;.you get the idea) and opted for this one. Once it arrived I was please to see that the handle wasn&rsquo;t HUGE (like some of the others) and it came with 1 replaceable head. Rinsed it and have been using ever since with no issues, no gross sneaky moldy areas (trust me I have checked), no charging issues, JUST A GREAT TOOTHBRUSH that leaves you feeling clean!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p>

<h5 id="it-s-the-best-electric-tooth-brush-i-ve-had-in-fifteen-years-of">It&rsquo;s the best electric tooth brush I&rsquo;ve had in fifteen years of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best electric tooth brush I&rsquo;ve had in fifteen years of owning one. Plus with the rebate and coupon inside the packaging the total cost came out at $6.96. Yes six dollars and ninety six, I had to write that out in case you thought that I had misprinted. I&rsquo;m going to buy another one for someone I know will be as impressed as me.</p>

<h5 id="recommend-though-might-consider-higher-level-with-30-sec-interval-alarm">Recommend - though might consider higher level with 30-sec interval alarm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wanted to get an electric toothbrush after recommendation from my dentist. Bought this more basic version and am not disappointed.I have used cheaper battery-powered electric toothbrushes in the past and found them to be kind of weak and frankly not worth the $$.Been using for the past 2 months and find it very powerful and my teeth feel very clean after using. Gotta be careful not to open your mouth too much unless you have the windex at the ready! Lesson learned there.This one has a 2-min warning only which is nice to make sure we brush long enough, but we have another Oral-B brush that gives a 30-sec warning for each section of the mouth which I find even more useful. But overall a good toothbrush.</p>
