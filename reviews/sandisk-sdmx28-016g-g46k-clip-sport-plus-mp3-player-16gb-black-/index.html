<h5 id="seems-to-be-the-sport-with-a-smaller-screen-no-recording-did-work-with-overdrive-sound-is-good-clip-plus-still-better">Seems to be the Sport with a smaller screen. No recording. Did work with Overdrive. Sound is good. Clip plus still better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are my first impressions, I will add more after I use this for a while. I bought one to compare to my Sansa Clip plus, which is my all time favorite of the Sansa Clips. I have owned pretty much every iteration of these since the e100 series, I love them for audiobooks and music, long battery life and cost. We literally have a dozen of them in my house.This is quite obviously based on the Clip Sport, with a smaller screen. In fact if you go to the site, the manual listed under the Jam is actually the Sport manual. I was not a big fan of the Clip Sport (or the Clip Zip) the larger screen sucked the battery, and I just do not care enough about screen art. But I decided to give this one a chance as it seemed more like the Clip Plus in the description.The Jam is the same size as the Clip plus. The clip design also the same as the Clip plus (non removable, unlike the original Clip which could be replaced). There is no longer an on button on the top, the middle oval button is the on/off as well as “select”. Not too happy about that, I tend to have problems sometimes with pausing the Clips accidently and having the on/off button in the middle is going to mean sometimes it will turn off when I happen to lean against something (or roll over when listening while going to sleep).I really think this is the same chipset as the Sport, which will mean you cannot Rockbox it.The Clip Plus has recording capabilities, this Jam does not.Build quality does not seem as good as the Plus. This Jam has a bit of a rattle to it, right out of the box.I do not like the buttons as much, it is harder to tell when you have pressed them compared to the raised button on the Clip Plus.Sound quality is still good, I cannot tell the difference between this and the Clip plus.The Jam does come with 8GB, some of the Clip Plus were smaller. Also can use up to a 32GB sd card. Mine is working fine with a 32GB sd card.I was able to transfer an Audiobook from Overdrive (mp3 format) which I downloaded from my library to the Jam. (Edit, someone asked for specific directions, I have added these in the comments of this review)I do not know what Sansa is doing. The Clip Plus was a great upgrade from the original Clip, with the addition of the ability to add an SD card. Since then they seem to be flailing around, each new version has added more problems and removed features. This Jam is better than the Fuze, Zip or the Sport, but it’s older big brother, the Clip Plus is still my favorite. I see, however, that the price for those is jumping over the last few weeks.*added after using for a few weeks*I really do not like that you have to hold down the middle button to turn it on. I like to be able to reach up with one hand to where I have it clipped on my shirt to turn on and off. The two button on also will turn off if I bump it.I also do not like that the sd card and the Sansa do not merge files. I have to remember where I put the file to find it (the Sansa plus shows you everything under, say podcast, on both the sd card and the Sansa. On the Clip plus, all audiobooks, or music or podcasts can be found under that file location regardless of if they are on the SD card or the actual device. On this Clip Jam they are separate.The battery life is a bit better, about 25% longer than the Sansa Clip Plus</p>

<h5 id="another-step-back">Another Step Back</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I reviewed the 2 gen older version of this mp3 player several years ago. The Sansa Clip+. Let me just direct you to that product since it is still the best mp3 player in this category/price range. It&rsquo;s successor, the Clip Zip, introduced a (crappy) color screen, slightly crappier build and a few less really useful features. It was annoying, but still a lot of capabilities in such a small form factor and under 50 bucks. Now the Clip Sport is here, and they&rsquo;ve gone another step backwards, shaving off a couple more features (including recording capabilities), enlarging the body and screen (but with the same low pixel density as before, and now regular LCD instead of OLED that the previous ones had), and making the interface just a tad less intuitive than before.I don&rsquo;t get it. They had several years to update hardware/specs, reintroduce features that consumers expressly missed in the last Clip, and maybe even <em>gasp</em> actually ADD features. Nope. Here&rsquo;s the crappiest Clip yet. Please pay $50 for the same slightly more worthless device because it&rsquo;s now LARGER.Bottom line: Screw this thing. Buy yourself a Clip+. Outside of not having a color screen here are the advantages of the Clip+: AMOLED screen (not full color but WAY easier to read in sunlight), more intuitive interface, better options including voice recorder, the ability to record and save radio broadcasts, better audiobook controls, smaller and more lightweight. If you need AAC (iTunes music format) compatability, go with the Clip Zip. It&rsquo;s not as good as the Clip+, but still better than the Sport.</p>

<h5 id="a-runner-s-perspective">A Runner&rsquo;s Perspective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A few points for perspective of my review. I&rsquo;m a Runner, so my review is from that perspective of primary use. Second, I&rsquo;m an Apple products user with a MacBook Air, iTunes as my primary PC. I&rsquo;ve owned multiple Apples Shuffles and Nanos and found the Shuffle was the best product for Running up to this point,.. with the exception that if the Shuffle gets wet it will die out.Because of your body sweating during long runs, I can go through 3 to 4 Shuffles a year. I know there are ways one can waterproof a Shuffle, but I&rsquo;ve not done this. The other issue I have with the Shuffle is it doesn&rsquo;t have an FM Radio (which the Clip Jam does).I know there is an Apple Nano that has an FM Radio, BUT it doesn&rsquo;t have a built in clip to the product and I wanted something smaller to the Shuffle that I could attach to my running shirt of short without any weighing my clothes down.I did a lot of research prior to me buying the Clip Jam and there is really nothing on the market that met my requirements of lightweight, small, that I could transfer my iTunes music to and had an FM Radio, except the Clip Jam.I was concerned how hard it could be to transfer my iTunes music over to the Sandisk Clip Jam, but it was extremely EASY to do. And from a quality of sound I find no difference in quality from the Apple Shuffle to the Clip Jam.And my main goal of having something with an FM Radio was achieved. The Clip Jam did great getting all my favorite local stations. The plus is that you can set stations for easy changing while on your Run.It is true the Clip Jam does not have the metal casing as the Apple Shuffle has. It&rsquo;s made out of a plastic type material,.. but it doesn&rsquo;t feel cheap or that it would break easily,.. it just feels light, which is what I wanted for my Runs.It also has the ability to use a microSDHC card to expand the 8GB it already has. Which will make it easy to download a lot of music for longer Runs where you may want more diversity.It also has a screen to search and put your music into folders which makes it easy to organize on the go,.. and to top it off it not expensive. Comparing it to the Shuffle, I was able to get the Clip Jam for $5 cheaper. A very small price to pay to keep one focused on Running to Music which is a life saver.I love it! I&rsquo;m a Clip Jam fan for sure,.. it will now be my new go to music product for Running.</p>
