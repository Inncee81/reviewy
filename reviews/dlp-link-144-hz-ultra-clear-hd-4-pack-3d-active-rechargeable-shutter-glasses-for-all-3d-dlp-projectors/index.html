<p>Please Note for BenQ 3D Projectors only we recommend Adult DLP LINK eD Elite 144 Hz 3D Glasses (eDimensional Active Rechargeable) for All 3D DLP Projectors. As certain newer BenQ 3D Projectors are putting off too strong of a signal. You can still use the 3DHeaven version DLP Link 3D glasses if you put a piece of scotch tape across part of the receiver on the front of the 3DHeaven version DLP Link 3D glasses. Thanks for Looking!</p>

<h5 id="great-price-and-great-quality">Great price and great quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These 3D glasses are perfect. They don&rsquo;t need to be charged very often, and I have yet to have one issue with them. They sync up instantly and work just as I would expect. Reviews of other brands complained that the glasses were too dark, but I don&rsquo;t find that to be the case with these at all. They are not perfectly clear, but the tint is barely noticeable. I increased the brightness just a few ticks up on my projectors 3D profile setting and it&rsquo;s really hard to tell the difference. I just wish that Amazon carried a kids size in these. I have been using a clip on strap to help them fit my 4 year olds head, which isn&rsquo;t the best solution, but works for now. Every pair comes with a bag, a cleaning cloth, and a charging cable. the cleaning cloths work pretty well, as my son likes to put fingerprints and popcorn butter all over the lenses. So far no issues. One thing I might consider doing is getting a multi-port charger so I don&rsquo;t have these all hanging off of one of my laptops when they need charging.</p>

<h5 id="get-these">Get these!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly as good as my Monster 3D glasses and got four of these for only $60 which is like half the price of the Monster glasses! They are just really good have not had any issues with the glasses losing sync, they turn on and connect quickly and are easy to turn off which means the batteries last quite awhile. For me the biggest question I had was would they be dark as they clearly have a tint on the glasses. But colors are excellent and I can&rsquo;t really notice much darkening from these which is awesome. I highly recommend if you are considering 3D glasses for your projector.I am using these on a Optoma HD33. Setup was simple just had to go and switch the DLP link option on via the on screen menu under 3D settings. Only have to do it once and then you are set every time you enable 3D mode.</p>

<h5 id="i-watched-the-free-3d-video-from-the-youtube-which-the-quality-isn-t-good-will-purchase-the-blueray-disc-for-better-quality">I watched the free 3D video from the youtube which the quality isn&rsquo;t good. Will purchase the blueray Disc for better quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works perfectly for my BenQ HT2050 projector. Just enable 3D feature from the projector and put on the glasses. I watched the free 3D video from the youtube which the quality isn&rsquo;t good. Will purchase the blueray Disc for better quality.updated:I love the glasses when it&rsquo;s working with full charge. Don&rsquo;t know if because of the malfunction or defect but the glasses don&rsquo;t hold the battery too good. Sometimes after the full charge, it flashes and ran out of battery after watching for 2-4 hours. I wonder if this true the glasses batteries can hold about 2-4 hours and have to recharge again&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="and-i-really-like-the-mat-feel-of-the-frames">and I really like the mat feel of the frames</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Optoma X312 projector that provides 3200 lumens and that&rsquo;s more than sufficient light with these 3D glasses. I&rsquo;m really impressed with the make of these glasses in terms of the materials and the size that can fit over prescription glasses but yet not droopy, and I really like the mat feel of the frames. Crystal clear and very sharp images. Thanks to these glasses I&rsquo;ve become a fanatic addict of 3D movies.It says you should charge the glasses&rsquo; battery once a month, but I found the batteries last quite long. I&rsquo;ve got my glasses for 6 weeks now but I&rsquo;m still using them without a charge. I guess that as long as we keep using them, we shouldn&rsquo;t need to charge the batteries too frequently.</p>

<h5 id="ok-in-general-but-some-not-working-and-need-to-return-those">OK in general but some not working and need to return those.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have ordered numerous of these in the past and have been generally pleased with their operation (except fort the nose guards that almost always fall off) but in my last order two pairs did not work, one appearing to charge but not work and the other not appearing to hold a charge. I tried to figure out how to return the two non-working pairs but could not determine out how to avoid saying the entire order of 4 were not working vs. saying only two of the 4 did not work. Need to know how to do this so I can return the bad pairs and get two working pairs to replace them. &ndash; RWD</p>

<h5 id="great-product-excellent-price">Great product, excellent price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first experience with 3d on the BenQ 1070, but it was a great experience. The depth and clarity on the 3d media with these glasses on was great and there was no major loss of brightness to the picture. The glasses sync up quickly and I had no problems with them up to today. We will see how they perform over time with multiple recharges. But my opinion this far is they are a good set of 3d glasses for the price.</p>

<h5 id="you-won-t-regret-em">You won&rsquo;t regret em.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordering another set. Work great with my BenQ ht1085ST.Would go active glasses over passive any day of the week.Multiple people have viewed 3D with them and have made comments on the drastic improvement over previous 3D experiences.Blows away color glasses.Avatar is a great Demo film if you want a reference, just blew me away after watching Jurrasic world or Up in 3d, a real 3d film just crushes the after thought processed ones.Glasses came with cleaning cloth and a usb cable. I have ample usb chargers so this was not a negative for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seem-to-be-the-best-price-versus-performance-around">Seem to be the best price versus performance around</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just push the on button and go. No setup necessary using my BenQ HT-2050 3D home theater projector. Light weight, and fit nicely over my prescription glasses. No noticeable flicker, and colors correct and vibrant. Walking out of the room, the glasses stay on for half a minute or so, and then go on standby. Walking back into the room and looking at the screen, the glasses start right back up. At a price significantly less than the big display &ldquo;name brands&rdquo; I definitely would buy again!</p>
