<h5 id="simple-useful-effective-but-not-for-power-users">Simple, useful, effective, but not for power users</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this for a Dell Latitude 10 tablet to make it a mini-computer for some simple tasks. Pairing was simple. The magnet for the case is solid. My only nitpicks are that one of the keys popped off on me (it was my fault, and the key popped right back on, but it still seemed a hair too fragile for what I had done) and the keys are small and close (again, this is for a mini-computer/tablet and not a laptop, so this is just something to be aware of and not a real problem). The tablet is held securely and the keyboard worked as expected. Again, be aware that this is a keyboard for a small tablet-type computer, so it&rsquo;s not a full-sized keyboard. That being said, once you get used to it, you can type fairly quickly on it and the keyboard keeps up. No power typing and no long-use typing, but simple document changes, emails, web searches, and other small tasks are adequately performed. And the case itself looks nice without adding more than expected bulk. Very pleased.</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Once linked through blue tooth it works great. Beats using the screen for typing. Recomend this product to any one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="generic-keyboard-case">Generic Keyboard Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very generic case and keyboard. The clamps do fit the Zenpad, but there is nothing else about this case that is Zenpad specific. That said I do like the case. It&rsquo;s thick with the keyboard, buit feels good in the hand, closes well, and works really well. So the case itself is good. What is not good, in fact, what is terrible is the generic keyboard that comes with it. The keyboard is okay for one finger typing, but for real typing it is bad. Do not buy this if you want a good keyboard. I replaced that keyboard with one I already had that is much better.The keyboard sticks to the case by magnets which are in the case, which works pretty well. So my replacement keyboard will stick to the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-item-for-surface-3">Must Have Item for Surface 3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great lil keyboard for those times you don&rsquo;t want to poke at the screen for writing. I love that the keyboards is held on magnetically, so you can easily leave it when you want to travel extra light! Looks very professional and it syncs up easily. Very pleased</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-made-the-poor-decision-of-purchasing-this-even-after-reading-the-negative">I made the poor decision of purchasing this even after reading the negative &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I made the poor decision of purchasing this even after reading the negative reviews. The package in general did not take long to come in, but that was the &ldquo;highlight&rdquo; of the entire process. Upon opening the box, the shipping box was not damaged at all; no dings, punctures, etc. However, after opening the shipping box, the box the keyboard actually came in looked like it was run over by someones bike, a moped, or sat on by Darth Vader. I tried to give the product box a benefit of a doubt, opened it and 3 kids were missing, completely broken off&hellip; Additionally, the keyboard looked the same the package did&hellip; the fact that this was like this PRIOR to going into the shipping box says there were zero eff&rsquo;s given in shipping my product&hellip; listen to the reviews. Spare yourself the annoyance and don&rsquo;t buy this garbage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-keyboard-connects-magnetically-to-the-case-and-comes-on-and-off-easily-but-doesn-t-fall-off">The keyboard connects magnetically to the case and comes on and off easily, but doesn&rsquo;t fall off</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got what I expected to receive. Perfectly sized for my Microsoft Surface 3, but anything larger would not fit. The keyboard charge lasts a long time, I&rsquo;ve had it for three months now and have charged it twice. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure if it needed to be charged the second time, I just did just in case. The keyboard connects magnetically to the case and comes on and off easily, but doesn&rsquo;t fall off. The grips that hold the corners are attached to elastic to the center which allows it to expand as needed to device size. The grips are made of plastic and covered with little pieces of rubber, I would assume those are to protect the corners of the device from being scratched by the plastic, and also to keep it from slipping. It holds snugly. My one complaint is that the rubber bits are already starting to tear a bit. The keyboard is smaller than a standard sized keyboard, but it&rsquo;s not so small that it&rsquo;s difficult to use. That being said, I have tiny lady fingers. I have been experiencing an issue with keys not working occasionally. It happen more with the numbers and upper letters of the keyboard mostly. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll stop working for a few seconds and you have to press the key several times before it will work, other times, which is why I&rsquo;m giving four stars, they won&rsquo;t work for several hours. This was a problem for me as I was filling out financial paperwork and only the numbers five and six worked. The other numbers did start working again several hours later though. It should be noted that the back is solid which means that you will not be able to use a rear facing camera. All of that being said, I think it is well worth the price I paid for it.</p>

<h5 id="georgeous-folio-but-it-doesn-t-work">Georgeous Folio&hellip;But It Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this keyboard case after trying another Bluetooth keyboard brand that I had to remove and re-pair every time I wanted to use it. I&rsquo;m not sure how other people with Surface 3 made this work, but I was unable to connect with this keyboard 90% of the time. I love the way it looks and desperately want to keep it. I contacted the seller for technical support to see if I might have done something wrong. There was no response from the seller and I didn&rsquo;t want to return for another potentially defective unit. So, I&rsquo;m returning it and bought the genuine Microsoft Type cover. I love the Microsoft Type Cover!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-design-for-many">good design for many.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting concept for connecting to any tablet by connecting at the corners with straps. Very innovative. Works well but i have issues with the tab hanging over the screen. I end up tucking it behind the tablet. I am using with my Samsung p500 amd it works well with the null keyboard application on the tab to prevent the keyboard from popping up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my husband and he loves the sturdy exterior and keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="i-wish-it-had-a-mouse-like-on-a-laptop-keyboard-because-there-is-no-way">I wish it had a mouse like on a laptop keyboard because there is no way &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish it had a mouse like on a laptop keyboard because there is no way to hook up a mouse to the tablet and my wife is kind of old school. Other than that, it works well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="other-then-that-i-love-the">other then that I love the</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>only reason I didn&rsquo;t give 5 stars is there&rsquo;s no opening for camera. other then that I love the product</p>

<h5 id="love-my-cooper-case-for-my-ipad-2">Love my Cooper Case for my iPad 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love my Cooper Case for my iPad 2. Description was exactly as written. Great for traveling because it protects my iPad and allows me to type on a regular keyboard</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Product is nice but it did not have wireless charging option on the tablet. I didnt want the inconvenience of charging the keypad separately from the tablet so I had to return and&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Product was great but the tablet needed to be returned. Then the keyboard had to be returned but I was forced to pay for the shipping which was 13.00 ,not a good deal for me</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-great-case-to-use-with-your-tablet">What a great case to use with your tablet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great case to use with your tablet. Easy to connect &amp; the battery lasts a long time. LOVE the color too.</p>
