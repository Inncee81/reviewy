<p>From the Manufacturer
Sleek and Serious</p>

<p>The PowerShot S100 is a sophisticated pocket-friendly point-and-shoot digital camera that has the power advanced users and enthusiasts need to create standout images. As with other PowerShot cameras, the compact PowerShot S100 incorporates all of the advanced Canon technologies that make capturing superb photos and video as easy as pressing a button. As automatic or manual as you need it to be, the PowerShot S100 is a serious photographic tool, which incorporates the Canon HS SYSTEM, now featuring the new DIGIC 5 Image Processor.  The fast f/2.0 lens helps you tackle unfavorable lighting and capture breathtaking portraits with beautiful, shallow depth-of-field. 12.1 Megapixels ensure crisp, richly detailed images, and a 5x Optical Zoom provides an excellent all-around range to shoot near or far. </p>

<p>Experience the Power</p>

<p>Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor</p>

<p>The latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power.  Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality.
Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results.
The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background.

<p>Canon CMOS Sensor</p>

<p>The PowerShot S100 digital camera employs a new Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. Inheriting much of the advanced technology developed for Canon EOS DSLR cameras, this sensor delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras, such as the PowerShot S100. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture without increased noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.
Canon HS SYSTEM</p>

<p>The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot S100 incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 6400. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.</p>

<p>Memorable Moments in Spectacular FULL HD
In addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot S100 makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot S100 can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.
HDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot S100. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot S100 supports HDMI-CEC technology, youíll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TVís remote control. (CEC ñ Consumer Electronic Control ñ is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)</p>

<p>iFrame Movie Support
It’s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot S100. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable (included). And because the PowerShot S100 supports HDMI-CEC technology, you’ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV’s remote control. (CEC – Consumer Electronic Control – is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)</p>

<p>Experience the Power
Full range of Shooting and Recording Modes Including RAW + JPEG</p>

<p>The PowerShot S100 lets you shoot in RAW mode, which captures images that are uncompressed and essentially unprocessed by the camera. Often the choice of advanced photographers, RAW images can be processed in your computer using Canon DPP (Digital Photo Professional) or other compatible third-party software. Creative control is completely in your hands as you adjust a wide range of variables to produce exactly the final image you want. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting.</p>

<p>Control Ring</p>

<p>Focus, Exposure, ISO, Step Zoom, or White Balance can now be adjusted more quickly and conveniently with the PowerShot S100’s control ring. Located at the base of the lens barrel, the ring is more intuitive than other types of controls for many experienced photographers. The functions that can be assigned to the control ring vary with shooting mode, and you can set your preferences quickly using the dedicated ring function selector button.</p>

<p>GPS Technology
The PowerShot S100 digital camera is equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)* technology. Now you can travel the world and let the camera automatically record the locations and local times of your stills and videos. The camera can also use the GPS unit to automatically set the exact time. You can maximize the usefulness of the GPS feature by using the special bundled Map Utility software that makes it fun to share the memories of your world adventures. In addition to displaying all your photos’ locations on a world map, the camera’s GPS system can also track your route from photo to photo – a great way to visualize each trip! You can also create and share custom maps and personal mini-travel guides with friends and family members.</p>

<p>A Steady Image is a Beautiful Image</p>

<p>Intelligent IS</p>

<p>The latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.</p>

<h5 id="best-truly-pocketable-camera">Best Truly Pocketable Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I owned five Powershot S Series (s30,s50,s60,s80,s90) cameras prior to purchasing the s100. I took close to 100,000 photos with my s90 in the two years that I owned it. I am a semi-professional photographer that owns multiple Canon EOS DSLR cameras with L lenses.First off, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to compare the s100 to DSLRs, APS-C, Four Thirds cameras. These large sensor cameras are in another class and even my really old Canon 10D with 6MPs will at low ISO have better image quality than the s100. If you don&rsquo;t mind a larger camera that is not pocketable and are willing to spend more, the s100 is not the best camera for you. For example, the Sony NEX-5N will give superior results to the s100 in nearly all situations.The s90, s95 and now s100 are all unique in that the are truly pocketable&ndash;all the competitors are too large for pant pockets (Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ-1, FujiFilm X10). Some of these cameras are quite good and all of them provide faster lenses across the zoom range (the s100&rsquo;s size precludes a faster zoom lens). But none of these competitors are comfortably pocketable&ndash;this means that the s100 has practically no competition for it&rsquo;s size as a truely pocketable semi-pro camera.If you don&rsquo;t need the manual control, the Canon 300HS will also take great pictures for less than half the price in a smaller/slimmer camera body. The s100 does have a great AUTO mode and multiple Scene modes which in most situations does an excellent job. But shooting both the s100 and 300HS in AUTO will lead to very similar results. The s100 differentiates itself by providing excellent manual control and the ability to shoot RAW images.Now if you are someone that wants pant pocketable camera with excellent manual controls and image quality, the s100 is very hard to beat. I take ten times more shots with my s100 than my DSLRs because I ALWAYS have it with me.If you already have a s90 or s95, there is little need to upgrade to the s100 immediately. The s100 has some worthy upgrades (24mm, GPS, better designed body) but the image quality is near identical to the s95/s90. My s90 took many falls and goo in an airplane pocket killed the flash otherwise i&rsquo;d stay with the s90. I have now taken close to 1500 photos with the s100 and here are my experiences of it&rsquo;s pros and cons:PROS:* The s100 is cleaner at high ISO (eg 1600 and above) but the difference isn&rsquo;t as substantial as Canon claims (for low ISO, there is no difference in noise)* s100 is even slimmer than the s95 which is was already quite pocketable* GPS is a great addition and quite accurate most of the time* rough texture finish makes the camera easier to hold and also looks great* rubber grips make camera easier to hold but don&rsquo;t expect miracles* mirror like shutter button is easier to find especially given the removal of the func button from the top of the camera* back wheel now has the perfect resistance and feedback* the delete button is not on the dial so I can finally delete while viewing a zoomed in on an image!!!* lens zooms very quickly (sometimes too quickly to get accurate zoom)* fast shutter speed (in fact in Continuous drive mode it is very difficult to take one photo&ndash;always get two photos and I am fairly fast releasing the shutter button&ndash;an additional slower Continuous mode option would have been helpful)* 8 shots in a second is a handy feature to have though not often used (limited to 8 shots and then have to wait for the photos to be written to the card)* 24mm wide-angle is very useful for indoor photography* lens is sharper across zoom range than the s90&ndash;with sharper corners (people have reported variation in the sharpness of the lens on early models)* ability to control max ISO and ISO selection criteria for Auto ISO* dynamic range correction works well* dedicated movie recording button* 1080p video recording (much better resolution but not as good low light capture than s90&amp;s95 but can&rsquo;t match Sony HX-9V)* can zoom while recording video with minimal noiseCONS:* all Canons Point&amp;Shoots have slower focus especially in the dark. The s100 is comparable or slightly slower than the s90. Fuji and Sony have made strides to provide faster focus and I hope Canon follows. Set shortcut button to Focus-lock to pre-focus&ndash;once focus is locked the s100 is really fast* NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHERS: a major con for me is that the s100 is locked to ISO80 for shutter speeds over 1sec. May not matter to most people but I loved shooting 15sec ISO400 shots with my s90* The display does not brighten as much in a dark room making composition more difficult. The s90 shows a very grainy but bright image in a near dark room where the s100&rsquo;s display is very dark (also if multiple shots are taken with the shutter button half pressed the display is darker for the subsequent shots)* The s100 is better in high-ISO short shutter speed situations but the s90 is better for long shutter speed photography* Auto mode is limited to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> (have to switch to P mode if you don&rsquo;t want to use a flash in a dim room)* HDR requires a tripod because camera does not align images (given the tech Canon really should auto-align the images).* battery life slightly worse than s90 (buy a second battery&ndash;I had three for my s90)* fast zoom with steps sometimes makes it difficult to get the exact zoom desired* Movies are great in well-lit areas but have a lot less gain than the s90 resulting in hi-res but darker movies* Sony&rsquo;s panoramics are fantastic and Canon is still using same approach as it did in the s30 in 2001!* always open flash if it is needed before handing the camera to anyone else. Everyone initially presses down on the flash resulting in a flash error.* price but you get what you pay forUPDATE 03/25/2012: Had to call Canon Support for the first time in a decade (lens error on s100). Discovered, that you have to pay to mail back the camera to their facility in Virginia and be without a camera and wait 2 weeks to get it back. Maybe I have been spoiled by the excellent warranty Amazon provides for it&rsquo;s products.UPDATE 05/31/2012: My Canon Service Center experience was much better than I expected. They kept me informed on each step of the process and got the camera back to me within a week. Yes, I had to pay to mail the camera to Canon and be without the camera for a week but the overall experience was excellent. (Have taken over 12,000 photos with S100 and still love it).SONY RX100 Announcement 06/05/2012: Sony has just announced what I consider to be the first pocketable camera that delivers better features and image quality than the Canon S95/S100. The only major con against the RX100 is that it costs $650. For that price you get a larger sensor, better iso performance, better video, much better auto focus, better features, ect. If price is not a concern the RX100 which will be released in July is the best pocketable camera to get based on early impressions of reviews and image quality comparisons. Sony DSC-RX100 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x ZoomUPDATE 09/18/2012: The Canon S110  was announced yesterday and is mostly unchanged from the S100 with the following notable changes: Wi-fi functionality, touchscreen, GPS functionality removed, presumably faster focus. Will cost $450.I will soon update this review to update it based on the options available today since there have been a number of changes in this camera segment in the last year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suppose that I am &ldquo;late to the party&rdquo; regarding the Canon PS S100. The S110 is already out as its replacement, and it is, of course, a fine camera. The time finally came to replace my venerable Digital Elph S50, and I did an enormous amount of research trying to decide what to replace it with for my &ldquo;pocketable&rdquo; walk-around camera. I tend to prefer Nikon for SLRs and Canon for small cameras (both are excellent), and my research continued to support the notion that Canon is right at the forefront for small cameras.Many recent reviewers have concentrated their reviews on comparing the S110 and the S100. I mostly will not. Since I have been absent from the small camera market scene for seven years, this review will instead mostly dwell on the improvements of the S100 over the earlier models, which observations I hope that someone will find useful. Very briefly, with respect to the excellent S110, for me the deciding factor in favor of the S100 are the analog controls and the non-presence of a touchscreen. Ergonomically I like the big shutter button and the all-analog controls of the S100. I tend to find touchscreen control of a camera non-intuitive; perhaps I am just a product of the baby-boomer generation. To further date myself, I miss the optical viewfinder that used to be standard on cameras of this class. Like almost all of its competition, the S100 uses the rear LCD as an electronic viewfinder. This is the wave of the future and the S100 is no exception. I am adapting.Examining the S100 I can see that Canon has improved much over the earlier generation of cameras. The first thing I am going to comment upon is the image quality &ndash; it is very, very good. Almost astounding, in fact for a camera of this size. Digital SLRs of a decade ago would be hard-pressed to take on the S100. Somehow Canon has squeezed a lot of performance out of the relatively small lens on the S100; partly due to its excellent sensor. This camera will effortlessly produce excellent images even under difficult light conditions. The image stabilization (&ldquo;IS&rdquo;) feature (together with this camera&rsquo;s excellent high ISO performance) made it possible for me to take reasonably sharp photos of nighttime Christmas lights, which is something my older pocket cameras could never accomplish to my satisfaction.The next improvement that I found pleasing on the S100 is the user interface. It is very intuitive. Canon has knocked most or all of the rough edges off of its interface. I found it very easy to quickly adapt to it, which was not true of my earlier Canon circa 2002. The AUTO function allows the user to be taking pictures right out of the box in a matter of minutes. The &ldquo;P&rdquo; (Program) mode has many more features but nevertheless is easy to figure out and master. To my surprise both aperture and speed priority settings are right there on the top control dial, so users who wish to really control their photos, e.g. depth of field or action blurring shots, will be at home with this camera.My final main observation concerning the S100 is its amazing feature set. As noted above, it features both Program, Aperture, and Focus-priority settings. Like a full-blown SLR it allows center-weighted metering, &ldquo;evaluative&rdquo; metering, and spot metering. It has a variety of different focusing modes. It also has scene settings mode and a &ldquo;filter effects&rdquo; mode which allows a number of interesting effects such as B&amp;W, sepia, vivid colors, and other effects. This camera allows the photographer to approach his or her shooting in a variety of different ways, and you really have to work at it to produce poor pictures with this camera. The AUTO or Scene settings will allow the shooter to let the camera make most of the decisions or, alternatively, the camera allows about as much flexibility as an SLR camera.Using a 32GB SD card the S100 will take approximately 10,000 photos, depending upon whether the shooter elects to shoot RAW, JPEG, or RAW+JPEG. Pretty amazing considering that only a decade or so ago we were all shooting 36 images on film and then paying ten dollars to get it developed so that we could see how our pictures turned out. There is no reason other than backup to worry about one&rsquo;s images on any vacation with this camera.I elected to go with the black version of the S100 and I am well-pleased with it. The black looks very snappy and professional. The aluminum body has a nice anti-skid texture that is very pleasing to the eyes and to the touch, and there is a rubber grip on the front that further aids in gripping the camera. The one issue as far as handling is concerned is that I do occasionally find my left hand blocking the pop-up flash at times. You have to watch that with this camera. Another nit: there is no recess or protective lip for the beautiful LCD viewfinder on the back of this camera. Buying one of the after-market protective products is an absolute must if you wish to avoid scratching this screen. Many are available and I recommend that users buy one at the same time as buying this camera. Last nit: this camera is a bit of a battery hog. Buying a spare battery is a good idea. A must, in fact, for the serious photographer.The camera features a 24-120 zoom lens that is F 2.0 when wide open. The lens becomes slower as you zoom in which is an inevitable trade-off for the smaller lens, but still, this is a fast lens for a camera of this class. Experienced users will know that to take good portrait shots a little zooming in from 24mm is a good idea; otherwise human subjects will be distorted. But for landscapes and other tight shots, 24mm is very nice to have.Canon has packed a lot of performance and features into the S100 and things have improved a lot since the last time I looked at the &ldquo;pocketable&rdquo; digital camera market.
