<h5 id="my-new-travel-and-hiking-buddy">My New Travel and Hiking Buddy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I&rsquo;m already making a list of things to use this bag for - it is that versatile. So far it&rsquo;s a definite hiking, carry-on, travel, shelling, beach, picnic, overnight, craft bag. I love that I can use it as a duffel or a backpack. The dimensions are airline compliant so you can definitely use it as your carry-on bag. I prefer this because I&rsquo;ve lost my luggage twice on vacations and had zero clothes. I just tested it when I unpacked my suitcase from my last vacation and I fit two weeks worth of outfits in it and still had room for toiletries. I use the rolling method that I found on a YouTube video to get the most room. Look it up, it will change your life. The side pocket is convenient for everything if you&rsquo;re traveling you can throw your passport and your boarding pass right in there and you don&rsquo;t have to go digging for it. If you&rsquo;re hiking you throw your water in there and it&rsquo;s easily accessible. If you&rsquo;re using it as an overnight bag you throw your toothbrush and your contact lens case right there so you have it. I take my bags to the beach a lot and the elements especially salt water really mess up my zippers quickly which is an expensive fix. This bag has the main zipper covered from the elements which I love and I also pictured below. My daughter already tried to steal this for school I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to get another one!</p>

<h5 id="great-bag">Great Bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was in need of a new travel bag and I love love love this one!It looks beautiful, it has the backpack strap option, has quite a few compartments, has lots of storage room, and I have already gotten 2 compliments when carrying it around campus.I got the large blackish green one, it has 2 outter pockets one is small, the other is large.The inside has a big opening where you can store anything, this size you could easily fit up to a 17 inch laptop in there if you wanted to, there&rsquo;s that much space! On the very back is a big opening which is where the straps for backpack is and the flap comes over the front which makes it a bit water resistant.There is also two hands on the back of it for duffle bag type of holding and then a side handle for sort of a brief case type of bag.There&rsquo;s nothing negative to say about this other than the slight smell, but that airs out within a day so there&rsquo;s nothing really bad! Great bag definitely recommend to travelers!</p>

<h5 id="nifty-bag-for-everyday-use">Nifty bag for everyday use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I purchased this bag because I needed something that I could but some gym clothes, shoes in and also take out with me out in town. When I received this bag, I liked the quality of the stitching and zippers used on this bag. It lets me know that this bag will last me some time. Also, the bag is pretty big. I decided to attach a video because sometimes pictures do not do the item any justice and this is one of those times. I highly recommend this bag for recreational use.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-quality-big-bag">Amazing quality big bag !!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to start with this bag ! The material is very heavy and you can tell it&rsquo;s very well put together! The many handles that it comes with are heavy duty plastic that are not gonna break easily! This bag has so much space it just keeps on giving, compartment after compartment! You can put it on your back like a book bag or you can carry it vertical or horizontal. The options are endless! In the photo below I put it compare to a 50 gallon tote so you can see the size! Love love love this bag</p>

<p>SAPPYGO Vintage Canvas Backpack Travel Bag Duffle Rucksack Men BackpackThis backpack surprised me. It is the size of what I am looking for whether a short or long trip. I put many clothes in and there is still room left over. It is amazing!!! It is canvas fabric with camo pattern leather and metal zippers. Very creative design!!! It has many ways to carry it, backpack, cross body, handbag, and double lift. I am going to use in the gym first. I do need a good size backpack for all the gears when I go to the gym.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Â Pretty cool bag if i do say so myself. It can be used both as a backpack or duffle bag. It is the perfect size to take with you everywhere you go whether it is traveling or just on a long hike. I personally got it to use as my new carry on when I am out traveling for a couple days. It is made of a canvas material and what seems to be feaux leather accents. It looks to be of very good quality and I have to say that I am overall impressed!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Pack is a beast!! I went camping this past weekend and I was literally able to fit everything in it. There was so much room and it wasnt heavy to begin with. I was able to put clothes, a pan and pot, some food, fire starters, a blanket, an extra pair of shoes, my hammock, and first aid kit with room to spare! I was amazed at how easy it was to carry. It is a very well made back pack and comfortable carry!</p>

<p>This bag is going to be great to travel with. I always struggle with a short trip. I have a business backpack, but I don&rsquo;t really want to take everything out to put my clothes in for a non-business trip. This is the perfect bag. It&rsquo;s got style and versatility. It&rsquo;s also a little rugged&hellip; Kinda fits my personality.</p>
