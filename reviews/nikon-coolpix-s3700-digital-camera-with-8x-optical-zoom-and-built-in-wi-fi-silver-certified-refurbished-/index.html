<h5 id="thin-is-in">Thin is in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned four or five digital cameras, going back to about 1999. Over the years, I have seen these cameras evolve, becoming more powerful, with more capacity and features, and at increasingly lower prices. I have a perfectly good Canon Powershot SX 150 and it takes fantastic pictures, although it is a bigger camera than this one. But like all people who are looking to find even more features at a better price-point, and also looking for a very thin, pocket size camera, after doing lots of online research, I settled on this Nikon.First of all, it is small. It is thin and it has many features that I will not go into, as they are readily available in the product description. Suffice it to say that I am impressed by this camera. The photos are crisp, the menus are intuitive, and making adjustments are straightforward. I will not be using the Wi-fi or video features, but would expect them to work very well indeed, based on the photos. The zoom. while not exactly earth-shaking is more than adequate for the amateur or serious amateur. If you ant more than 8X and are a serious camera enthusiast, get one of the $1K+ big boys.The EN-EL 19 battery is wafer thin, and takes a while to charge, but holds the charge quite well. I will probably get a backup battery and charger for trips. The camera took a 16GB SDHC class 10 card without a glitch. I am sure it will provide all the capacity I will need.One last thing, The instructions that come with the camera are pretty basic. But, as is becoming standard practice, you can go to the Nikon website and download the BIG instruction manual.1-22-2016: I have now had this camera for about 9 months. I recently took on a trip to Hawaii and took around 500 photos at the highest resolution. Also took about 16 minutes of videos. The SDHC micro card easily handled all this information. My experience is that you can get about 300-350 photos on a single charge. Beforehand, I bought a spare battery and charger to take along. It paid off, as there was one time I had run out of juice, and changing over to the new battery took about 30 seconds.All in all, this is a fine camera. It does, as you may suspect, have limitations compared to other more expensive cameras &ndash; wish the optical zoom was higher, but I do like the thinness of the camera. It fit easily into a small side cargo pocket on my shorts, and there was really no bulge at all. It&rsquo;s a keeper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nikon has my attention. Owning several cameras during my life, at 68 I am a more seasoned user since I did take photos for many years with a Mamiya 1000 DTL SLR and numerous lenses and filters. Now I am seeking the lightest weight camera, with the highest megapixels and a decent zoom ability - with a user friendly in-camera menu&hellip; and of course a better battery source than rechargeable alkaline batteries (which I find very frustrating at best). I own a ten year old Fuji Finepix E550 - and for it&rsquo;s time, a great little, light weight camera. I have reviewed the real manual (which is downloadable through the Nikon website) - and printed out pages I need to review until they are memorized. The in-camera menus are* intuitive and while the screen is tiny for my tired old eyes - put on your reading glasses and proceed! The buttons and menus are well organized - the &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; button is a little tiny, but unless you have super large hands - should not be an issue. Not having a &lsquo;view finder&rsquo; is a drawback - but in such a tiny camera, I will get used to using the screen. My first few photos taken were excellent and I am a happy camper. I hope this camera holds up well since I love it already.</p>

<h5 id="love-it-but-some-flaws">Love it but some flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this camera about a month now and I love it. The pics are great and it is small enough to fit in even my smallest purse. It does however have pros and cons like anything.ProsSmall size doesn&rsquo;t mean a teeny tiny screen.The pictures are great after you get used to the settings.Tons of settings.Nature shots turn out well even with varied light.It is very light.ConsLow battery life (I got an accessory kit with a rapid charger and 2 extra batteries so this isn&rsquo;t a problem for me.The battery/memory card area&rsquo;a cover is plastic and feels breakable and flimsy, so changing batteries is a little nerve wracking.It takes practice before you get good pics.The manual is not very informative.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="software-glitches-with-the-wifi-made-my-coolpix-nearly-unusable">Software Glitches with the Wifi Made My Coolpix Nearly Unusable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Nikon Coolpix S3700 crapped out one year to the date from which I purchased it. The software associated with the Wifi interferes with the functions of focusing or taking a photo with a flash. For example, trying to zoom in automatically engages the Wifi software, and there is no way to disable it, and no way to take a photo.The camera has become almost useless, except that one can still point and shoot for daytime photos, but cannot zoom in at all nor take a photo with a flash.There are also far fewer photo editing options as compared with the S3600.I won&rsquo;t buy another point and shoot that has Wifi.I may replace this one with a Nikon Coolpix S3600</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-light-weight-camera">Great light weight camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This small light weight camera has been a great gift for my husband who is a realtor and always carried around heavy, expensive cameras, as he takes his own photos for his real estate listings, and found this little camera he can carry in his pocket does as well or better on quality pictures!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-flashy-but-performs-as-expected">Nothing flashy, but performs as expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I was looking for. Nothing flashy, easy to use, nice quality.The only complaint I have is the awkward cover for the port plug and the plug itself. It feels like it will eventually get worn down, and the port is finicky with how the cord sits it it. But it isn&rsquo;t on my list of super important features so I&rsquo;m happy with the product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-happy">Very happy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wife loves it. Works great, and fairly easy to use. Good zoom feature. Only draw back is slow to take next pic. Takes a good couple of seconds between shots.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-good-with-indoor-photos">Not good with indoor photos</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law. I set it up for her so she didn&rsquo;t have to do anything. After taking 10 test photos I was hugely disappointed. Her main use would have been indoor pics of her grandchildren and children at family functions. Indoor pics came out blurry and the lighting is horrible in auto mode with flash. I wasn&rsquo;t looking for anything fancy or perfect but this quality was far from acceptable.</p>
