</ul>

<p>Onkyo continues to be a hi-res trailblazer with its DP-X1 Digital Audio Player. Backed by two ESS Technology Sabre ES9018K2M DACs and two Sabre 9601K amps for balanced headphone output, the DP-X1 is the only DAP with such an advanced configuration, the result of which is unprecedented power and control. The DP-X1 also has two types of balanced drives: ACG and BTL, for greater stability and clean, crystal clear sound. The unit is also among the first to support the MQA format, an anticipated new standard that captures and preserves the original studio recording, and delivers it in a package small enough to stream. From a storage standpoint, the DP-X1 can expand to 432GBs, thanks to dual micro-SDXC card slots and can supply up to 16 hours of playback.</p>

<h5 id="i-wish-i-could-give-it-6-stars">I wish I could give it 6 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am simply beyond the moon with this player. I&rsquo;ll try to keep this short and concise in case there are other people like me who are on the fence. I consider myself an audiophile. I have high-end audiophile equipment in my house for listening. I have a vast collection of CD&rsquo;s which have all been ripped to FLAC. My tastes range from lounge music to speed-metal.I am also a guy on the move and I DO NOT want to carry 15 devices and battery packs with me to listen to audiophile quality music on the go! I can&rsquo;t believe people do this?!?! I mean, no offense, more power to you but that&rsquo;s not me. With a set of B&amp;W C5 Series 2 in-ear (remember: guy on the move), I&rsquo;m in heaven. Here&rsquo;s the bullet list of everything I love about this full-on Android awesomeness of a player:- Not gonna go into all the guts of this thing but the separate boards for DAC &amp; amps makes total sense to me, read about it and it PAYS OFF. This thing sounds amazing. As with many great audio purchases, I&rsquo;m hearing details that I haven&rsquo;t heard before.- Massive storage - how great. The only thing that could make this better (are you listening Onkyo - Gen 2) is if this thing had a little 512GB to 1TB mSata drive in it. How awesome would that be?&hellip;and fast too. In any case 400GB of external storage is great with me, I can get much of my collection onto this thing.- It&rsquo;s a full-on Android device! Yayyyy!!!! It can do so many other things. For example, in my lifelong quest to find more good music to listen to, I use Rhapsody because it&rsquo;s inexpensive, you can follow other users with similar tastes and uncover cool new music, their stations are pretty good, their library is great, and you can download everything you want for offline listening to 320KB MP3&rsquo;s. Yeah, it&rsquo;s lossy but it&rsquo;s decent and the other pros make up for it. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll offer FLAC someday. Anyway, I can now put Rhapsody on this device! All my music (much of it anyway) with me on the go. Plus, what-ever other essential apps make sense on this device, you can install them- It&rsquo;s got a cool Stand-Alone Mode that turns off all extraneous electronics and screen to produce the most unadulterated output possible&hellip;Very nice.- It&rsquo;s got a cool &amp; simple Line-Out mode which I pipe into my car stereo&rsquo;s Aux input. Very nice again!- I have always hated EQ&rsquo;s - I don&rsquo;t like to color my music but I have to say, the EQ on this thing is legit! So flexible. It helps to bring out some lost detail in old CD&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s probably the best EQ I&rsquo;ve ever heard and I don&rsquo;t want to give myself too much credit but I have a background in this area and that is saying something coming from me.- At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure about the boxy look of the thing but then I ordered the Onkyo case for it. It&rsquo;s a thing of beauty.- The volume knob is dead-sexy. Very discretized. So nice.- I want Bluetooth! Not for listening all the time but I want the convenience of BT and in particular aptX BT. I really can&rsquo;t imagine who wouldn&rsquo;t? For example, if I&rsquo;m at friends house and want to play some tunes for them on their _____ BT device, on my buddy&rsquo;s speedboat, in a rental car, whatever, that&rsquo;s convenient! BT is everywhere, it&rsquo;s one more option when you&rsquo;re on the move. Even if I use it 5% of the time - I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s there! Because of this convenience, and my lifestyle, I would pick a BT enabled audio player over one that didn&rsquo;t have it. It helped me pull the trigger on this player and I&rsquo;m so glad I did.I could probably go on for days but hopefully that helped you make the &ldquo;core&rdquo; decision. Buy this thing. It&rsquo;ll be a favorite gadget of yours too, no doubt.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-thing-i-tired-in-recent-year">the best thing i tired in recent year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the best thing i tired in recent year&hellip;. for balance connection its far superior then ak120ii and i am a fan boy of astell and kern. but product design is far behind then ak players. it has very sharp corners and uncomfortable without a cover in hand which they dont include but all ak player comes with a cover. sound quality wise for balance connection its very close to chord mojo but mojo is more musical and doesn&rsquo;t break a sweat to drive larger headphones . this player is best for iem and headphone less then 150 ohm.other then sound quality display is very poor quality and buttons are stiff not tactile . i gave the 5 star only for sound quality and this is most impotent aspect of a dap. but if don&rsquo;t use balance connection then chose ak junior cause that player cost less and have more superior single ended sound quality.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-player-software-a-little-odd">Excellent player&hellip; Software a little odd?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received my player a few days ago and I have limited time with it. However, my initial experience has been largely positive. I only have a handful of lossless files but even my standard MP3s sound better. Great sound stage and spatial representation. I am not using any of the eq settings so I can&rsquo;t speak to that.The process of transferring files to the device is incredibly simple using the Onkyo software. Brings over playlists and all. Which brings me to some oddities&hellip; First, it brought over every playlist, not just those I selected. However, the unselected ones are empty. Huh? What&rsquo;s up with that? The other thing is that it will often show all playlists are empty. I need to go back out of music player and back in to see songs. Sometimes more than once.I have not checked to see if there is an available update so perhaps some of this has been addressed.The feel of the device is superb. Small and heavy, which I really like. Feels like a sturdy build. Nice screen with responsive touch.At this time, I give it 4 stars only because the software is a little glitchy. However, my initial impression of sound quality is great. No comparison to my iPhone 6 and Fiio 7 amp. And this is so much more compact.Oh BTW, battery life is pretty atrocious. You can probably get 5-6 hours if you are using WiFi and/or apps while you listen. Do not expect this to have battery performance like a cell phone or iPad-type device.Given all that, I would definitely buy it again.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-beautiful-sounding-and-looking-player">This is a beautiful sounding, and looking player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a beautiful sounding, and looking player ! I&rsquo;ve had it over a month and it works flawlessly. It uses the same fantastic audio solution (ESS SABRE ES 9018 ) as the world&rsquo;s best blue ray player, very clean !. Order the leather case, the edges of the DP X1 are somewhat sharp, and the case is really, really nice !. Turn the DP X! off when not in use, if not your battery will run down.Turn the equalizer off for best sound. If using J RIVER as a music source record your music using the F.L.A.C. solution, their own A.S.P. solution is not supported. Onkyo&rsquo;s own X-DAP music storage source does not load onto the X1 as neatly as JRIVER. I&rsquo;m using two 200 gb chips, and they work fine.</p>
