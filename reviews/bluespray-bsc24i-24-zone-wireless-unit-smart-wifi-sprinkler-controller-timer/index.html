<h5 id="limited-usability-must-keep-your-configuration-simple">Limited Usability &ndash; Must keep your configuration simple</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased this it appeared that this device had quite the interface to customize my sprinkler usage. I have 12 zones and very specific needs for time of year and watering times in each zone. Thus, I thought this product was perfect for me.Upon installing and using the device, there is a lot of bugs that I have found and general lack of tools and data to help you work around the issues. The issues I found include:1. Schedules must remain simple, or buggy scheduling occurs2. Lack of Logs - Can&rsquo;t tell what was watered, for how long and when3. Poor visibility - Calendar schedule doesn&rsquo;t tell you what will be watered today.4. Stability issues - 1 unit goes dark for hours at a time5. Long watering times &gt;45 minutes - unit shuts down every 3-4 minutes and then restarts 1 minute laterThis product could be very useful, but the issues above make the product more work than for me than my old controllers.Maybe if they release a 2.0 version of their firmware some of the issues above could be fixed.</p>

<h5 id="update-the-very-definition-of-codependency-but-bluespray-is-getting-better">Update&hellip; The very definition of codependency. - but Bluespray is getting better!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: BlueSpray has been working much better since auto-updates were enabled and having the repeater. It does still require occasional electroshock therapy (once every 3 months), but now isn&rsquo;t so demanding. I have even created a program called CatShooter, which will cycle through all the sprinklers for 15 seconds when the feral cats in the neighborhood get howling at night. Very useful&hellip; and I can tell that Bluespray likes it too.Summary: Codependency is defined as a psychological condition or a relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by another who is affected with a pathological condition; and in broader terms, it refers to the dependence on the needs of, or control by, another. If you are prepared for this, then this is the device for you&hellip;.My relationship with Bluespray started in 2013. After setting up the device, although easy to do, Bluespray seemed to require me to come back to it often. I quickly realized that Bluespray wanted and needed me to interact with it. If I didn&rsquo;t do this, Bluespray got upset. If I communicate with it when it is in one of these moods, I learned that it thinks the time is January of 1970 as this is the time the system clock always seems to reset itself to (also the zero time for Unix). Fortunately, if I connect my browser to Bluespray, it likes me again and picks up the time from my system and is happy for a while, but if I forgot to connect to it regularly, alas&hellip; back to 1970.Picking up when Bluespray lapses back to the 70&rsquo;s is fairly easy to see: I wake up in the morning and the garage door is open because Bluespray didn&rsquo;t close it last night, or if when coming home from vacation, I sometimes have dead plant because Bluespray has decided not to water them. But, connecting to it again usually fixes Bluespray, but not the plants (alas). And if I cannot connect to it via a browser which also happens, I just power cycle the device (like Electroshock therapy), and this makes Bluespray happy again.Bluespray does behave better if it has a good connection to the Internet, where I guess it like to talk to NTP servers all day because they keep telling it what time it is. However, because Bluespray comes equipped with a tiny low power WIFI antennae, it can&rsquo;t easily connect to my WIFI router which is less than 100 ft. This is strange because Siri has 3 WIFI bars.I think this makes Bluespray loney and sad, but by giving Bluespray a repeater (another $50-$100) and spending time getting that working with the security on my home WIFI network, Bluespray stays happy as long as both the repeater and router stay connected to the Internet, which also seems to be a problem in my Verizon DSL, but that is another woeful story, which I won&rsquo;t go in to.Talking to the creators of Bluespray, fortunately is quite easy, and they are very friendly being also from Texas. We have interacted a lot, trading funny stories about Bluespray&hellip; We both wonder why Bluespray acts weird, we tweak settings on Bluespray, and sometimes fully reset Bluespray which lets me reprogram the device, seasons, sensors, schedules, and zones all over again. Also, you can get Bluespray to act differently if you upgrade its firmware. This is fun because Bluespray acts very funny then making the garage door do funny things like go up and down every five seconds until, at last, the door finds its way all the way down and it stops. By fully resetting the device and reprogramming it, Bluespray acts nicely again.As with any codependent relationship, Bluespray and I are not as happy as we were at the beginning. What I had hoped to be a cool little helper has turned into relationship which requires attention often and is depressing us both (well at least me). My hope is that someday, Bluespray will act well and do as I ask, perhaps with another firmware upgrade, or perhaps with some hidden configuration setting, or perhaps Avidz would send me a new and improved WIFI antennae, or perhaps add a RJ45 ethernet port, perhaps perhaps perhaps&hellip;.I love you Bluespray.</p>

<h5 id="a-little-work-to-set-it-up-but-immense-flexibility">A little work to set it up but immense flexibility</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(Originally reviewed on Mar 19 with 4 stars. Updated to 5 stars following excellent interactions with Customer Support)Great product. Setup is a little bit laborious the first time, but once things are set it&rsquo;s painless to operate and I no longer have to go out and reprogram my controller every time the seasons change or daylight saving time adjusts.So that you understand how the programming works, you can set up an infinite number of programs (e.g., open master valve, water zone 1 for 4 minutes, zone 2 for 2 minutes, with 1 minute between zones, etc.) and choose either minutes or seconds for time units. You can then also set up an infinite number of schedules (e.g., run program X on Mondays at 5am). You can prevent it from watering if the weather forecast has specified % chance of rain, and/or high winds. It also has a rain sensor (sold separately) with the ability to conserve water by watering less frequently.As such, it is immensely flexible and able to perform just about any schedule you would like. It may take a little time to set up your schedule the first time, but after that you can forget about it.For my needs, I was slightly frustrated with a few &ldquo;simple&rdquo; programming concepts; one was repeating the same schedule multiple times at one hour intervals (&ldquo;cycle and soak&rdquo;). I had to put in 3 separate schedules starting 1 hour apart from each other. BlueSpray customer support has reached out to me and suggested their engineers will consider adding this feature. [EDIT 3/11/2017: I just went to add a new schedule and see this feature has been added! Six stars!]My other frustration was the limited flexibility of the &ldquo;seaonal&rdquo; feature. You can define seasons by start/stop dates, but its only use is &ldquo;only run this schedule during this season&rdquo;. I want to run the same program but on different days of the week based on season, e.g., &ldquo;Monday during Winter, M/W/F during Spring and Fall, and 7 days during Summer.&rdquo; To do this, I had to do three schedules, for Monday (all year), W/F (spring to fall), and Tu/Th/Sa/Su (Summer). Combined with the 3 start times in the earlier comment this meant 9 schedules to accomplish 1 essential task. Again, BlueSpray customer support has been proactive in reaching out to me, offering scheduling suggestions, and considering adding this feature to future firmware.I really enjoy having access both from my computer and my smartphone. The ability to turn zones on/off from my phone while checking and adjusting sprinkler heads (and/or to stop the dog from digging my freshly planted grass) is awesome.One note: this controller is not designed for outdoor use. Other reviews indicated BlueSpray used to sell an outdoor enclosure on their site, but they no longer do. I contacted them and they recommended the Orbit 57095 Sprinkler System Weather-Resistant Outdoor-Mounted Controller Timer Box Cover which works great.The reason for my earlier 4 star review was a glitch in network connectivity where if the signal was too weak, it would be difficult to re-sync without power cycling it. I purchased a wifi range extender to improve my signal from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> bar to 2 bars at the units and have had no issues since. This, combined with the great customer support, has convinced me to give the product a full 5 stars.I&rsquo;ve already personally recommended this controller to a friend and am extremely pleased with my purchase.</p>
