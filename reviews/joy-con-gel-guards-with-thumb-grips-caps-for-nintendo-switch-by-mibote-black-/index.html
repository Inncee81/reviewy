<h5 id="gel-guards-for-controllers">Gel Guards for Controllers.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Joy-Con Gel Guards with Thumb Grips Caps for my Nintendo Switch and the color is black very easy to put on and great to keep the controllers from slipping from your hands when playing games. Very well made and a must have for the Nintendo controllers. I would recommend this product to anybody that has the Nintendo Switch Controllers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="some-flaws-with-fit-but-nice-to-have">Some flaws with fit but nice to have.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The joystick covers fit well and make the Switch controllers much easier to use. These are my favorite thing about this product. The controller covers themselves are ok. My left (blue) one is fine, but the right (red) one tends to drift inward “off” the right Joycon over the course of several minutes. These covers are cheap so it’s not a big deal, but it’s annoying during an intense Mario Kart matchup.Like others have said, it can be hard to press the + / - buttons since they are recessed beneath the cover. I don’t mind, but it may be hard for those who keep their nails short.The one other minor complaint I have (which I think is true of all Joy-Con covers, not just these) is that you have to take them off in order to use the Joy-Cons with the Joy-Con grip. I assume this is also true of the Joy-Con steering wheels, although I can’t say for sure since I don’t own one. They do go on and off very easily, but just something to keep in mind depending on your plan of use.Eh, overall I like them. They have their flaws, but considering the price, they’re a decent purchase.</p>

<h5 id="i-know-a-lot-of-people-think-that-holding-the-switch-is-comfortable-etc">I know a lot of people think that holding the switch is comfortable, etc</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are a must for the switch on handheld mode. I know a lot of people think that holding the switch is comfortable, etc. but for me, and for a good number of others, the console is actually quite uncomfortable to hold. They just don&rsquo;t sit well in my hands. That being said, these cover cases for your joy-cons definitely help. The console is still uncomfortable for me to hold but these make it a little better. The bigger bottom and the silicone texture definitely held get a better grip on the device. On top of that, the two button covers that come with the case are absolutely superb. They stay on nice and secure and make the joy sticks far more comfortable to maneuver. Overall, great product for the switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-comfortable-joy-con-grips-at-a-great-price">Very comfortable joy con grips at a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these grips because the PDP ones I ordered weren&rsquo;t expected to ship for a month. These are very comparable to the PDP grips. I like the PDP grips slightly better because they have a lip on the top part (near the L/R and SL/SR buttons) that help keep the grips in place. These do not have that but they stay on rather well without it. Other than that, they are comparable.These come with a pair of covers for the joysticks, which I find an absolute must. My fingers occasionally slipped off the joysticks without them. They make playing with the joy con much better. The joystick grips with these are IMO better than the PDP ones.Overall, for $8, these do a really damn good job of improving the grip and comfort of the joy con. They aren&rsquo;t an absolute must have Switch accessory, but a convenient upgrade to have.</p>

<h5 id="easier-on-the-hands">Easier on the hands!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these as a birthday gift for my adult nephew. He LOVES them! He tends to play for hours on end after work and on the weekends and has complained about hand pain as well as sweat from holding the controls for so long. The covers are super soft and made of silicone so they are providing relief to his hands from holding the controller for so long.I was worried that the covers not being branded would interfere with the actual controllers but they do not and they fit just perfect with no slipping at all. They have also helped with his problem of his hands getting sweaty as they are soft and silicone so they help reduce the amount of sweating he has after playing for long periods of time. He is very happy with how they fit and work regardless of what mode he is playing in. With them being much cheaper than branded products I would highly recommend these as the grip of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="extremely-comfortable-grips">Extremely comfortable grips!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already had grips so buying another set had me on the fence. I was surprised at how perfect they fit and how comfortable they felt! I now use them as my permanent solution for keeping my joy cons clean and in good condition. The thumb stick covers also are much nicer as well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-got-the-colored-covers-and-they-look-great-and-fit-pretty-good-too">I got the colored Covers and they look great and fit pretty good too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the colored Covers and they look great and fit pretty good too, I also appreciate the colored thumb caps.The only issue I had was that the cover makes it a little hard to press the &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="essential-accessory-for-playing-in-handheld-mode">Essential accessory for playing in handheld mode</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Joy-Con guards are exactly what I was looking for to add a little more comfort to my Joy Con&rsquo;s, while at the same time protecting them. The Joy-Con&rsquo;s slide into these rubber guards securely but can also be removed fairly effortlessly if you need to attach them to the controller grip. They are not going to be super tight but they are the best I&rsquo;ve seen.I tried plastic covers that only protected the bottom and they were very hard to detach and didn&rsquo;t have as good a feel as these do overall. They also had a risk of scratching so I decided for my needs of sometimes having them on and sometimes off, these were the best choice.The attachable joystick pads are also great they go on easily and are tight. They give it more of a console controller feel and that is welcome.The only gripe I had but got used to is that the buttons will be harder to press since the gel guards surround each button, but I get used to it fairly quick. Small price to pay for keeping these expensive accessories clean and protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-a-grip">Get A Grip!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really good for hiding joycons in between your butt cheeks. The grip is superior to any other competing products such as condoms.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-keeping-joy-con-clean-only">Good for keeping Joy-Con clean only.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are good to protect Joy-Con, but not really is a good use. They not fit well, also too thick. I have a really heard time for pushing + and - bottoms, appreciatefor the&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-grips">Awesome Grips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great grips, makes it easier on the hands when playing games and fit nicely and is very comfortable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exceeded-expectations">Exceeded Expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well fitted. More snug than I imagined. Great product! Great price! I might buy the red and blue ones just because.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="package-not-complete">Package not complete</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the joycon gel guards but the grip/gel for the buttons were not included in the package for red and blue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loose-on-joy-cons">Loose on joy cons</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After placing these grips on the joy cons, I held the switch up and the grips came right off on the bottoms. No matter how I adjusted these they won&rsquo;t stay snug in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-price">Worth the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these for better grip because I have big hands. The price is great for these. I bought the Grey Nintendo switch and not the red and blue system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-covers-are-fine-just-not-the-same-as-the-ones-advertised">The covers are fine just not the same as the ones advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To start off the other reviews are fake. The covers are fine just not the same as the ones advertised</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works just as needed, a must have for on the go in my opinion, especially for anyone who gets sweaty palms as these protect the console as well. Easily clean with a wipe</p>
