<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>A compact all-in-one lens that&rsquo;s ready for anything.
If you&rsquo;re looking for an outstanding grab-and-go lens—the kind you&rsquo;ll keep on your camera for nearly every situation—check out the new AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR. Optimized to draw full potential from Nikon’s high-resolution DX-format image sensors, it delivers beautiful ultra-sharp photos and videos with softly blurred backgrounds. Its versatile 7.8x zoom range (18mm to 140mm) lets you shoot everything from wide-angle family portraits to telephoto close-ups on the sports field. 4 stops of VR image stabliization means sharper handheld photos and video, especially when shooting in low light or at maximum focal length. You can even get as close as 1.48-feet from your subject for macro-style close-ups!</p>

<p>Clarity within reach
7.8x wide-angle to telephoto zoom
Developed with high pixel count D-SLRs in mind, the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR delivers vibrant, detail-rich photos and videos across its entire zoom range. Zoom out for an 18mm wide-angle view that’s great for group shots, landscapes or any time you need to fit more into the frame. Zoom in for 140mm of telephoto reach—enough zoom to capture close-ups of your favorite player from the sidelines. In between, you have standard views similar to what you see with your eyes and medium telephoto views ideal for portraits. Whatever shot comes your way, you’ll be ready to catch it.</p>

<p>Sharper handheld shooting
The VR image stabilization advantage
The AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR versatility is strengthened by 4 stops of VR image stabilization. Capture sharp, shake-free handheld photos and videos in low-light situations, when you want to use slower shutter speeds, and at telephoto distances, when even the smallest amount of camera shake can ruin a shot.</p>

<p>Exquisite performance
Advanced Nikon technology and superb NIKKOR optics
AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR is an advanced lens designed to get the most from high-resolution Nikon D-SLRs. In addition to VR image stabilization, it uses ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass, which virtually eliminates reflections and lens flare for better contrast and Aspherical (AS) lens elements for minimizing aberration and improving image integrity and color. Nikon’s remarkable Silent Wave Motor (SWM) provides ultra-fast, ultra-quiet autofocusing, a major advantage when recording video. And, of course, the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR has NIKKOR’s renowned quality of construction and outstanding optics.</p>

<h5 id="new-dslr-owners-this-is-the-best-walk-around-lens">New DSLR owners - This is the best walk around lens!</h5>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>- - HELPFUL HINT - - -If you just purchased your first Nikon DSLR (DX format), want to upgrade from the kit lens, and don&rsquo;t know which lens to buy - This is it! Trust me, just buy it! Better yet, if you haven&rsquo;t purchased your camera yet, buy the body only, and then get this lens, (or buy it bundled as an alternative to the kit lens).This is a DX lens, so I assume if you are looking at this lens that you are not a professional photographer with a full frame camera. Chances are&hellip;you are either an amateur or an enthusiast, looking to upgrade from the kit lens, and wondering which lens to buy.When I purchased my first DSLR, I spent months pouring over reviews, reading DxOMark ratings, and trying to figure out which lens would fill my needs. Every new DSLR owner always wants to know which lens they should buy, and with the selection out there, it can get overwhelming. Luckily, I had a professional photographer friend who told me to get this.WHY YOU SHOULD BUY IT:1. With the 18-140 range, you are covering everything from wide-angle to a decent telephoto range that will fit most photographer&rsquo;s needs. Unless you need a super zoom, for photographing wildlife, this is an almost perfect range, and will replace a variety of lenses, enabling you to carry only this lens for the vast majority of your photography needs. I can&rsquo;t overstate how important this is. For instance, on vacation, you need only bring this one lens instead of 2 or 3. Very convenient, and enables you to catch random shots without having to change lenses.2. Great optics, nice and sharp with good color. Unless you are willing to spend over $1000, it&rsquo;s hard to beat the quality. There is a reason it is rated so highly!3. Solid build, acceptably fast autofocus, smooth, with no creep, and a nice metal mount. Some other lenses, (like the 18-105) have a plastic mount, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion (shame on you Nikon for making plastic mounts). If you have ever slightly knocked a lens with a plastic mount, you know that the plastic mount breaks insanely easily, and is expensive to replace, (and don&rsquo;t even bother trying to do it yourself). This lens feels good in the hand, nice and solid, yet balanced. It&rsquo;s a little on the heavy side, but considering you only need to carry this lens, instead of several&hellip;.it&rsquo;s a wash weight-wise.4. Considering that this lens will replace several, the price point is decent, particularly when you compare the optics to some of the other Nikon offerings.IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE 18-105:Don&rsquo;t do it. The 18-105 has less range, lower quality optics, and a plastic mount, which is a crappy flimsy thing that will eventually break, unless you treat it very, very gingerly. For approximately $100 more, you are getting much better quality optics, better range, and a solid metal mount that will take a beating. The $100 savings of the 18-105 is simply not worth it.</li>

<h5 id="great-lens-for-general-use">Great lens for general use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great walk around lens for people who want to spend more time composing shots and not missing the moment while switching lenses to get the right focal length. Its autofocus is very quick and very quiet due to its Silent Wave Motor. To me with a D7100 body it is very sharp and does everything I need. I have had experience using the Nikon 18-200 zoom and easily recommend this over that due to it being less expensive, less cumbersome to work with, and just as good in quality. The slightly lower difference of 140 vs 200mm telephoto range is not that significant. I carry a 55 - 300 mm for the really long shots. For me this is a great lens that is on my camera body for 90% of my normal usage and I could not be happier with it.</p>

<h5 id="my-two-week-trip-through-europe-and-couldn-t-be-happier-i-m-not-a-pro">&hellip; my two week trip through Europe and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I&rsquo;m not a pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took this lens on my two week trip through Europe and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I&rsquo;m not a pro, but I do a little bit of serious shooting and this lens captured everything with great color and clarity. And it was a huge advantage to be able to carry a single lens for pretty much every application for the trip! Definitely worth the money!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-distortion-great-all-around-lens">No distortion, great all around lens!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great all purpose lens for close ups and landscapes. Relatively decent weight for a good lens with no fringe or distortion on my photos. Highly recommended for step up from kit 18-55 Nikkor lens, with better outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-good-lens-for-nikon-d3300">Really good lens for Nikon D3300</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this lens to use as everyday lens on my Nikon D3300 but also to use for macro photography to get me more zoom than 55mm without switching to my large lens. I took a few shots around the house but really got to use it at the conservatory to photo butterflies and flowers.Lens worked great and put out some beautiful clear shots and I am and friends were very impressed with this lens and the shots I got. I will recommend it to other nikon owners.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-walk-around-lens">Terrific walk-around lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sharp, light and perfect for those day-to-day photo treks. I supplement with a long-range telephoto, but except for wildlife, this lens is perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-at-price-point">High quality at price point</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this lens. Replaced the included 18-55mm lens. This lens heavier and feels better constructed. Works flawlessly with silent motor drive. Auto focus fast and accurate. Optics clearly step above standard kit lens. These Nikon lenses all look similar but can vary significantly in their quality. You get what you pay for. I found this to be higher quality than usual at an ideal price point. I use this with my 70-300mm which covers 95% 0f my needs. Just need a wide angle and am set. Buy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-colors-were-great-and-sharpness-outstanding-for-the-price-point">The colors were great, and sharpness outstanding for the price point</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far this lens is outstanding! Took my first pics on an overcast day outdoors. The colors were great, and sharpness outstanding for the price point. Similar build to the 18-70 with the extra reach! I can&rsquo;t wait to get pics in bright sun. Sharpness looked to be consistent all through the focal range, shooting at 160th sec and f5.6 with a D90. Build quality and the focal range were my reasons for buying this! So far I am very impressed! Added thoughts on this lens: I find the feel and weight of lens to be excellent for the price point. The extra reach makes this almost perfect as an all in one lens. There is absolutely no zoom creep, but the lens feels a little tight in mounting. Fortunately this covers about 95 % of the focal range most people would need, so This lens will live right on my camera almost permanently.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice lens. I have notice some zoom creep, but not as much as my old 18-200VR.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great One! (Y)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent photos taken at graduation. Clear and crisp</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-hobbyist-lense-there-is">The best hobbyist lense there is.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The best hobbyist lense there is. If doing portraits or weddings I use primes, but when walking around this lense is on my D5300 80% of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-lens">Awesome lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very sharp throughout it&rsquo;s range. Great as walkabout lens. Used with a D7000 and no problems at all. I would definitely recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-pictures-came-out-great">My pictures came out great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works well as I expected, only that it is very heavy for traveling. I got the 18-105 before and it is much lighter. My pictures came out great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-seller">Great seller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>She shipped this quickly and this is a great lens.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bummed">Bummed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with all the scratches? I&rsquo;m aware it&rsquo;s used but come on.</p>
