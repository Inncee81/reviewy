<h5 id="wonderful-camera-for-the-price">Wonderful camera for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Wow, do I love this camera. I have been using a GoPro Hero for a while now but one of the main complaints I have always had with it is there is no viewer screen to see what&rsquo;s going on. While it isn&rsquo;t a huge viewer screen, it is plenty big to see what is going on. You can certainly make sure what mode it is in from the rear side. Sure, the GoPro has a little LCD on the front to indicate things, but when riding I can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on like is it still running or did the battery die.The programming on this is great and it is so easy to use. It comes with so many parts, a lot more than my previous action camera as well as an extra lock part and back door. There is everything from a wipe, helmet mounts and a mount you can use for your belt. It comes with 1 battery that seems to last for a long time. It was charged up a bit when it arrived.The pictures I am adding to the review are from the camera itself and were created by this camera. I took the video in 1080P. It does make the file big. Like near 1 MB per 10 minutes. But that is not too bad and it will be a while to fill up 32 GB. I like that is also has motion capture ability as well.I had already a 32 GB card that I used in my GoPro. I just popped that in there formatted it and it is using it fine. The only downside is it doesn&rsquo;t have Wi-Fi so all transfers have to be wired. I did not test the waterproof ability of the case. One thing I do like about the case compared to my other camera is the lock mechanism. It has a slide thing that has to be moved before you can open it to keep it from accidentally popping open. The camera is also a very tight fit in the case.it does not come with any software for editing. There is also plenty of apps out there though to do video editing as well. What else can I say but I am really happy with the camera. For under $40, it is a great deal if you want a more than starting level action camera with 1080 and 12 MP.If you have found my product review to be helpful, please hit the helpful button. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well. You certainly do not have to, I do not get anything from it, but I get a good feeling that I helped someone. If you have any questions about my experience with this product, please leave me a comment. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> This action camera was in good price so I purchased it without hesitate. I&rsquo;ve been using it ,so far so good . It is a good substitute for Go pro. I like this camera so much!!!Pros:-good for beginners to learn and use-lightweight design,small size ,convinces to carry anywhere-came with a lot of accessories( such as cases,cables) ,fits for multiple ways to use-multiple choices (video or pic,digital zoom, language setting,etc.)-pics and videos quality are pretty good, quite clearly!!!!!!-early to take out form the waterproof case-170° HD wide-angle lens-30M waterproof-longer working time up to 90 minsCons:-does not have remote control and a carry bagOverall , it is a good option for action camera!!! Affordable price, good quality product, and easy to use. Highly recommend!!!!</p>

<p>I was looking to purchase an outdoor/sport camera for my cruise in december . After doing a little research and looking at quite a few models I decided to go with that one.I am really happy with all the stuff comes with this camera, and how much it does. Every possible accessory I would need is included in this kit. lots of mounts, cables, and even an extra battery, The mounts allow me to mount it on a tripod, mono-pod, helmet, arms or chest mount, and it even has a bicycle mount.I really like about this camera is that even this is a ready-to-go, out of the box, point and shoot type of camera but it is also a professional style camera.lots of possible adjustment, setting or tweak that I would want to change is available with the on-screen menu. It is super east to get set up. And it has an amazingly clear and bright full hd LCD screen. And the 170 wide angle lens makes amazing wide angle video with no image distortion.The waterproof case is awesome. It is totally waterproof, dust and sand proof, even air proof&hellip; it floats! All of the control buttons on the camera can be accessed while it is in the waterproof housing &hellip; with buttons on the outside of the case. And I can still see the bright LCD screen while it is in the case. I&rsquo;ve used this underwater and it&rsquo;s is flawless! Works perfectly!I&rsquo;m very impressed with the picture quality. This records in full 4K HD video! And the audio and video are beautiful&hellip; especially outdoor scenes.. The 1080p HD recordings I have made are amazing. This is an incredible value for all that this does, and for all that I got with it!</p>

<h5 id="what-a-great-little-camera">What a great little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great little camera. Lightweight, compact, seems to be good quality and picture is clear! The case is very protective. It comes with a battery, waterproof case, Bicycle Stand, Fixed Frame Mount, Clip and some mount. The only downsides are that you have to connect the camera to USB charging cable to charge (not like those cameras that come with battery charging device) and it does not have a memory card. But with this price, it expected not include that much accessory too. Takes great pictures. It has small view screen which picture looks little but on the computer looks like big and clean. Easy to use in camera and photo modes (1080p with high resolution + 12MP photo ) than Go pro. The setting is not that complicated if you have to change the pixel size or timer setting. It does not have wifi but can upgrade to AC400 or AC600 which includes WiFi function and higher MP photo. Overall this action camera is good for the price.</p>
