NEW! Built-in Wi-Fi connectivity and FREE app turn your mobile device into a viewfinder and shutter remote from up to 30 feet away. Features include time delay, photo burst, time lapse and slow motion camera settings; resolution and framerate selection; viewing, editing, saving, printing and sharing photos on social networks; and more.</p>

<p>Huge, out-of-the-box fun. In little more than 1 cubic inch.
Standing at just 35mm, the Polaroid CUBE+ is here to prove that the best things do indeed come in small packages. This tiny action camera supports microSD cards up to 128 GB, and is ready to capture your most exciting moments in full HD video (1440p at 30FPS, 1080p at 30 or 60 FPS, 720p at 30, 60 or 120FPS) or 8-megapixel images. If you’re living a life that’s fit for film, make the CUBE+ your constant companion. It is weatherproof, splashproof and shockproof, and more than capable of handling anything you throw at it. But not only does it look after itself, it looks after you: With a 124° wide-angle lens, it sees the big picture and bears witness to your most outrageous shtick. And with a battery life of up to 107 minutes recording time (1080p at 30 FPS with Wi-Fi turned off), anytime is go time.</p>

<p>Packs a mounting magnet; sticks to any metal surface.
The fun rarely sits around waiting… That’s why the Polaroid CUBE+ features an integrated magnet in its bottom housing. Simply pop the camera onto your helmet, skateboard, bicycle, or any other metal surface, and it’ll stick with you through thick and thin. There’s no need to fiddle with bands, straps or other makeshift apparatuses. What’s more, the CUBE+ adds advanced auto image stabilization to the mix, helping you capture stable video even when you give it a run for its money, while its weatherproof design is perfect for wakeboarding, water skiing or just chillin’ by the pool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I honestly loved this little guy. The functionality is great and had a lot of fun with it while it worked.After a month and a half of use the camera just stopped working. It would not turn on and did not respond to charging or anything of the sort.Eventually it turned on again but after recording 1 video it stopped working again.unacceptable.I was really hoping to keep using this camera, but with such poor reliability I am returning this and getting a GoPro Session.</p>

<h5 id="fun-little-action-camera-great-for-kids">Fun little action camera. Great for kids.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fun little camera. My teenage child has no trouble using it. It uses its own wi-fi radio to connect to a cell phone, which shows a live video feed from the camera, good for aligning the image. You can control the camera from the phone or by the button on top. You can transfer images or video wirelessly to a phone, or by direct connection you can download to a laptop. Image quality is very good.As a bonus, there&rsquo;s a strong magnet on its base. This is pretty useful: It&rsquo;ll stick to the roof or hood of a car while driving, and we used it to fashion attachments to various objects without any extra accessories.Underwater housing works well too, though the button is stiff (softened up nicely with a dab of silicone grease).</p>

<h5 id="great-little-camera">Great little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I started with the original &lsquo;Cube&rsquo;- I got 2 in a row that had defective batteries- I cant recommend the original Cube cam..The new &lsquo;Cube +&rsquo; is far superior to the old model in many regards, I&rsquo;m glad I spent the extra money to get this camera.First, the form factor is great- it is less than 1.5 inches cube, and less than 2oz in weight,This small camera is fantastic mounted on my drones, they required very tiny adjustments to the PIDs to get make up for the extra weight.The magnet is a great feature and the rubber case with the recessed lens makes it nearly indestructible.This is a solid little camera for the money, great buy IMO.</p>

<p>Listen. I don&rsquo;t know how seriously you want to take my review as I am about a level 1 when it comes to tech. But hey, I really like this thing.PROS:1. It is easy to turn on and off - I found the last model confusing. Long hold, short hold, double tap? This one you just turn on, sync to app and control from there2. The video looks better than you think - really. It will look a little grainy on your phone and slow (it is over wifi), but it will look great once you upload it.3. The sound isn&rsquo;t the worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard - and I&rsquo;m saying this as a classical musician4. The magnet is strong!5. Look how cute it is!6. YOu can see what the camera is seeing before filiming - a big pro over the last oneCONS:1. It doesn&rsquo;t automatically sync - meaning that you have to turn the wifi on (fine), connect it to your phone (ugh) then open the app and connect to app (wtf), Update, polaroid.2. You need a gazillion accessories, and will want them. So don&rsquo;t think your purchase ends here.3. App could use more features, filters, types of filming.WORTH IT.What do I use it for?My classroom: Attaching it to instruments and creating fun videos for our recruitment pageTravel: Attaching it to my car and driving around a new town (just attach to roof and go, or use suction cup to window), taking video of high elevations (use tripod), underwater (with case)</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-camera">I love this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this camera! After doing tons of research including videos comparing this to the go pro sessions, I purchased this. I am so happy with this purchase! The small size makes it so easy to carry every were, and the simple design is essay to use. Those features combined make it so perfect for being able to quickly pull it out and take a photo or video with one hand while on the go. It is perfect for traveling, and has AMAZING picture quality. I was honestly stunned with how beautiful the photos I took on this were! The only draw back to this camera are that it is almost impossible to find accessories for it in store (this was a problem for me when I went skiing and the head mount didn&rsquo;t come on time. I thought I might be able to find one in store but couldn&rsquo;t, and wasn&rsquo;t able to take videos while skiing). The only other thing is I don&rsquo;t believe it has sound (or maybe I just haven&rsquo;t turned it on), but that hasn&rsquo;t been that big of a problem. I would recommend spending the extra money on the plus because the app means you can look at the photos and videos you took on the go, and it has stabilization to make it not shaky. All in all I really love this camera and would recommend.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well priced, small and feature rich camera. I had ordered one a year ago, but I accidentally busted the charging port recently, so I purchased another. I received the newest version that was relabeled to be the &lsquo;Live Stream&rsquo; version. According to Amazon, that version is $20 more than this, so I was okay with it. I believe the only change is software anyways.The camera shoots rather nice HD videos, and really nice time lapse videos (for the price). Pairs well with my phone and transfer of files is reasonably quick. It is only slightly lacking in the picture and slow motion world. Pictures are just okay, compared to the HD video, and the slow motion is lacking the quality of more expensive cameras. However, the image stabilization works amazing. You do lose some viewing angle, but it makes for a shake free video, even on my motorcycle. The App works well in my experience, and there are plenty of features to keep the average Joe happy. The magnet base is extremely nice to have, and actually holds very well. If video is started with the App, and the camera is 90 degrees to the ground, it will orient the image afterwards in the App.Overall, I would buy it again in a year if I broke it again. I do recommend getting a waterproof case for it so you can shoot underwater.</p>
