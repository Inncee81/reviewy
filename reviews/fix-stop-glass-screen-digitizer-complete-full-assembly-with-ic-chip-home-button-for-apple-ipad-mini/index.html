<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-product-educate-yourself-first">excellent product, educate yourself first</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item on a whim to fix my son&rsquo;s iPad mini. I was aware of the underwhelming reviews. The product works perfectly. My wife and I successfully replaced the screen in about one hour. It has worked flawlessly since. Educate yourself on how to do it on youtube. I would recommend using a blow dryer rather than a heat gun. We used a heat gun thinking the adhesive probably needed a lot of energy to release. This is not the case, with just a few seconds of heat, we were able to pry the glass off. In hindsight, slower heating would be safer. We did overheat the top corner of the iPad causing some damage to the LCD. A very small section of the screen is foggy due to over heating. Although not perfect, the damage is not a problem and has nothing to due with this product.This product comes with a pre-connected cable which is very important. Some models offered are not pre connected, don&rsquo;t waste your time with those. This product also has adhesive strips already attached that work amazingly well.This is an excellent product for what it is. It is simply a part! It is a quality part. It does not come with directions or hand-holding. If you are willing to do a little research on YouTube and have above average common sense, you can do this job. The product itself, is good!</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-product">Really Nice Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really impressed with the quality of this screen. I&rsquo;ve fixed quite a few Apple products and have used a few different vendors. I will say they did an awesome job preinstalling all of the parts (which you would otherwise have to transfer over yourself). 1) kapton and electrical tapes were perfectly installed on the IC chip preventing the frame from contacting the chip which if not done causes phantom touching among other problems which can drive a person nuts. 2) Home button bracket is solid and comes with the rubber gasket which makes for a nice click and prevents dust and water vapor from getting in. Nice job with tapes on home button cable as well. 3) Adhesive was better most I&rsquo;ve tried. Many times the adhesive is weak and you need to put some weight on it until it&rsquo;s locked down in place or it can pop up. This stayed in place right from the start. Nicely done. Now to see if it holds up!! Pics of finished repair.</p>

<h5 id="works-perfectly-45-minute-install-found-a-helpful-install-video">Works perfectly, 45 minute install (found a helpful install video)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I put of installing this because I was honestly afraid of the project. But my oldest don really wanted his mini back and do we dove in to it.First off find a great YouTube fix it video that you can follow along with. It&rsquo;s a must for a successful repair, unless you have experience.I&rsquo;ve done one other screen on an iPhone so it was not a foreign process. But Apple changes many things from design to design.I used the irepairfast video on YouTube. It&rsquo;s an hour and 9 minutes from start to finish. Depending on how smoothly your broken glass comes out you may be faster or slower. We were fortunate to get the glass out smoothly and we were able to fast forward. Out time to complete the project was 45 minutes.I had to charge the iPad for a while because it was completely dead. But upon plugging it in I got the charge icon, so I figured we were successful. I say we, because my 11 year old son was the sidekick on this job.After charging, the iPad powers up and touch function is perfect. The colors are correct and do far it appears we have a successful repair. I feel badly that I delayed doing this for so long.I suggest watching a few repair videos before ordering, just to be prepared. When you are ready to jump, this screen works great</p>

<h5 id="fit-is-good">fit is good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great. This not a easy project if you have never done this before. I have done many iphone screens, but this was the first Ipad screen I did, but it was easier than the Iphone screen. This item is fully loaded with all the parts needed including the home button assembly. Just remove the old glass, peel the plastic from the adhesive tape (glue) from the perimeter of the new glass, then install. The fit was perfect. The key is to make sure you remove all the old adhesive before you install the new glass. Any old adhesive will make the new glass sit incorrectly. . The heat gun helps to soften it and then rub it out with a cloth rag. I then used a combination of alcohol and acetone to remove any residue of the old adhesive. There is no instruction sheet or guide but you can youtube it and find many videos on how to install. The function and fit was very good. The only thing, a very minor thing, is that the home bottom seems to sit a tad bit higher than the original.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-fine-for-a-while">Worked fine for a while</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The item was shipped quickly and arrived soon in a safe packaging. The digitizer was installed with no problems and seems to work like the original one. The set of tools sent with the digitizer are clearly low quality plastic, but they do their job and they are quite handy for replacing the digitizer. Unfortunately, the device stopped working after a couple of days! There is no short-circuit or something else.. Having a closer look, I noticed that there are bubbles inside the digitizer. I don&rsquo;t know if this the root of its problems, but the fact is that digitized is not working anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-for-about-three-weeks">Works great for about three weeks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great and was rather easy to install for my hubby tho we break screens a lot so he is used to changing them out. Haven&rsquo;t noticed any bad spot where it doesn&rsquo;t touch or work well at so 🤷‍♀️ Will update if that changes. From 4stars to 1 (Update) after about three weeks one side no longer worked and would have to flip the screen till the home screen faced the other way then I could touch the app I wanted. Also dead spots along the middle and splotchy all over and will sense you pushed random spots verse where you did and start flickering. Then with a shock proof case my 6yr old dropped it from her hands to the table infront of her (screen up) cause it was having another one of its flicker fits and the screen cracked. Ugh.</p>

<h5 id="defective-part-waste-of-time">Defective Part. WASTE of time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Defective screen, thought I could try and get one on amazon but of course the screen was bad. No touch detection, tried re-connect nothing.</p>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits but doesnt seem to be compatable with my ipad&hellip;.screen glitches and starts scrolling by itself&hellip;.</p>

<p>Perfect fit!</p>

<h5 id="two-stars-1">Two Stars</h5>

<h5 id="sad-to-say-that-after-installing">Sad to say that after installing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldnt find my ipad for month since I purchased this product. Finally found my ipad last weekend and just installed it today.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>as expected</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tools-then-no-tools-make-up-your-mind">Tools, then no tools. Make up your mind.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>first one arrived with defective adhesive. I sent it back. Ordered a 2nd one after returning. The first one came with a nice set of tools to use. Guess what, 2nd one didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h5 id="pay-a-little-more-to-avoid-buying-2-screens">Pay a little more to avoid buying 2 screens.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked fine for 2 days and then it stopped. Now it doesn&rsquo;t work at all and now I have to buy a new screen.</p>
