<h5 id="cute-bowls-but-they-don-t-stick">Cute bowls, but they don&rsquo;t stick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bowls are really cute, but if you&rsquo;re buying them to prevent your toddler from sending food flying all over your floor, look elsewhere. My 12 month old can get the bowl&rsquo;s suction free in less than 1 second.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-can-t-buy-your-way-out-of-this-phase">You can&rsquo;t buy your way out of this phase&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pay the premium for the suction, it&rsquo;s not worth it. I wish I could give negative stars. Just use some sturdy bowls and some gentle, consistent discipline. You can&rsquo;t buy your way out of this phase.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-set-for-the-kids">best set for the kids</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have an almost 2 year old toddler who thinks that when he is done with something he should throw it on the floor. The dogs are getting fat from eating everything that ends up there. I originally bought these at a local store and loved them so much I bought more from Amazon. They stick great to the tray of his high chair. He can occasionally get the plates up but he has to really pull hard and it takes a while. Overall, they work great. They are microwave safe and have gone through dishwasher several times with no problems. Only con, and it is a little one, is that they scratch easily. If something needs to be cut up, do it before you put it on the plate. Not a big deal for us and not enough of a con to even deduct a star. Highly recommend.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="long-time-user">Long time user!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used these bowls with both my kids. They are awesome. They stick to the high chair so baby cannot pull it and throw food everywhere. My 4 year old still likes to use these bowl on our glass coffee table so he doesn&rsquo;t accidentally spill whatever snack he has in his bowl. They are durable, and go in the dishwasher easily. There&rsquo;s another set that comes with lids also that I have. I LOVE The lids. They are leak proof and I will often take baby food with me on the go in these bowlsREAD MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-find">A Great Find!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The suction cups hold well on a high chair, counter, etc. I appreciate the 3 sizes as well, would like to see multi-packs in the large size, to use in food prep, actually. LOL Arrived 2 days after ordering, in perfect condition. I am usually irritated by the type of packaging that all small items seem to come in, the plastic encased in cardboard kind of packaging, HOWEVER, I turned this over to find a way to open it and, VOILA, a tab pops up and it opens quickly. No going for scissors or a knife to pry it open. A small thing, but it was fun to find that thoughtful tab!READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-messy">Great for the messy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son is super messy when it comes to eating so we thought these bowls would make a big difference. It sort of did help with the transition from high chair eating to eating from a bowl but overall he still made a mess. It did help though with clean up in the sense that he could not throw the bowl off the highchair so easily. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about these bowls is that they are not microwavable, or at least I have not read that it is so if you&rsquo;re serving hot food you would microwave in something else and then have to put it in the bowl. I do like the set and the different sizes which helps and now my son is more comfortable using other bowls and plates but we still watch him because I think he&rsquo;s at that cause and effect stage where he drops the bowl, we pick it up and then drops the bowl and we pick it up and then this happens again so if you have one of those little rascals these bowls do make it a little easier to dampen this repetitious and messy cycle. Good luck mommies and daddiesREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="of-course-if-you-have-an-uber-well-behaved-little-one-then-sure">Of course if you have an uber well behaved little one then sure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are what you would except of &ldquo;suction&rdquo; bowls at the ready of eager, curious and curiously strong toddlers - either flying or spilling of its contents. Of course if you have an uber well behaved little one then sure, these would be perfect! I gave them 3 stars because realistically, they stay in place maybe slightly longer than a normal non-suction bowl would, and the little dude seems pretty entertained by them. I don&rsquo;t believe they are microwave safe which just created one extra dish I need to wash and only the smallest bowl has a lid - which makes storing/cleaning even more of an &ldquo;issue&rdquo; since i need to either put plastic wrap on tap or put it in a different bowl that does have a lid. I know, these are huge issues (just kidding) but they deserve to be mentioned none the less. Last thing - buy these at wal mart. I saw them there for 4-5 bucks less than on amazon.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="perfect-first-bowls">Perfect first bowls!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these bowls!! Our 9 month old is eating puréed food twice a day mixed with rice cereal so we need appropriately sized dishes to mix in and feed him out of. These bowls are perfect to suction to his highchair tray to keep finger foods fairly contained but mostly easier for him to grab while he&rsquo;s learning. The varying sizes help pick the right size for whatever puréed foods were giving him. Super cute, the suction works and they are easily stackable to save space in the cupboard!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work great! My daughter hasn’t figured out how to take them off her tray yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="their-suction-feature-is-useless">Their suction feature is useless</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were a total disappointment. From day one, they didn&rsquo;t stick to any surface for more than 30-60 seconds which means I could never let my grabby 1-year-old use these without&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="munchkin-needs-to-update-their-main-images-received-clear">Munchkin needs to update their main images - received clear &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Munchkin needs to update their main images - received clear bowls instead of the white and colored ones in main images.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality was far superior to what I was expecting. Very satisfied!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="has-great-suction">Has great suction!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these with the Inglesina table chair and table, and they work well with it. Sticks to the table and the grandson hasn&rsquo;t pulled them off yet.</p>

<h5 id="literally-the-best">Literally the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The suction is strong and the products are sturdy! Very well crafted. I’m extremely impressed my lil guy couldn’t figure out how to get it off!Customer Video Review</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great suction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-in-theory-but">Great in theory, but&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overview: My first thought when I saw this was that this would be so useful and clever but in execution I had a completely different experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-son-ripped-these-right-off-his-high-chair-table">My son ripped these right off his high chair table &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son ripped these right off his high chair table. They are cute and I do use them as bowls to mix his food, so not a total loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meh">Meh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great vowl, but doesn&rsquo;t hold suction long, which defeats the purpose of its use.</p>
