<h5 id="great-water-bottle-carrier-stylish">Great Water Bottle Carrier! Stylish!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve tried various methods of carrying water bottles, and this has proved to be one of the best! The item is a simple neoprene sleeve with a vibrant and attractive pattern of purple, light blue, and black. The graphics include a butterfly, flower outlines, and simple &ldquo;swooshes.&rdquo; The open end has a drawstring closure with a press lock to keep your drink secure in the neoprene sleeve. In the picture below, you can see my 500 ml water bottle in the sleeve; a nice, secure fit! This sleeve would accept most individual plastic bottles found in convenience stores, as well as the standard plastic water bottle. There are also a multitude of metal and glass water bottles that would fit this sleeve; just make sure they mimic the diameter of a standard 500 ml plastic soda bottle. The neoprene sleeve provides substantial insulation to help keep your item hot or cold. The item comes with a simple adjustable shoulder strap with two plastic clips, that fasten to metal &ldquo;D&rdquo; rings that are attached to the neoprene sleeve. The item is packaged in simple clear plastic &ldquo;bag&rdquo; packaging that allows the vibrant color and pattern to show through. I am very happy to recommend this product. I did receive a sample at no cost to evaluate and review. If you found this review helpful, please vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; below!</p>

<h5 id="love-it-great-insulated-water-bottle-holder-vibrant-colors">Love it - Great insulated water bottle holder - vibrant colors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent protection for your water bottle. There are many things I love about this holder:Pros:The colors are vibrantThe neoprene material is thick for maximum insulationFits Dansani, iron mountain 20 oz bottlesStitching is made very well and they utilize a wider stitch which I like as they hold better.This is perfect for me as I like to throw a water bottle in the freezer and grab it in the morning. The issue I normally have is if I place my frozen water bottle in my purse the contents get wet. This protects that, the neoprene material keeps the moisture on the inside.There is also 2 sturdy d rings, to attach the included adjustable belt buckle. The straps are long enough you can use it as a lanyard, crossover, over the shoulder or even to hang from your waist all your preference. This is also great if you are gonna be running errands all morning and want to keep a cold drink with you. With the pending summer heat this will be a must.Overall great quality, love the vibrant colors.I received this in exchange for my honest review and opinion.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-the-print-and-the-neoprene-is-thick-enough-to">I love the print and the neoprene is thick enough to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these. Pros: I love the print and the neoprene is thick enough to keep a bottle cold for a while. Cons: I use a standard 16.9 ounce water bottle. Unfortunately, if you use that size, the mouth of the water bottle is slightly below the edge of the neoprene. You either have to fold the neoprene material down or slide the bottle up, which is kind of a pain, especially if you drink a lot of water and/or want to sit the bottle on your desk etc (always pulling the bottle out and back in, in order to drink). Also, the holder has a strong chemical smell which dissipated somewhat over time but hasn&rsquo;t faded completely. Finally,the string around the top (that is used to tighten the holder around the mouth of the bottle) frayed and unraveled after 2-3 weeks of use. We had to just cut it off and make do without it.</p>

<h5 id="a-pretty-holder-to-carry-my-bottles">A pretty holder to carry my bottles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I always have a water bottle with me. Sometimes I like my water cold, but sitting out, it gets warm quick. I wanted something to help keep my water cold, and carry my bottle at the same time. I decided on the Red Butterfly 750ML Water Sport Bottle Cover Pouch Insulated Soft Sleeve Holder Case +Shoulder Strap 750ML:PBC-035This has a nice long strap so I can wear it across my body when I&rsquo;m out &amp; about at an event. It&rsquo;s pretty, so I don&rsquo;t feel like a dork carrying around my bottle. The neoprene material helps keep my bottle cool, even on a warm day. This could also be used to hold my thermal bottle full of coffee. I haven&rsquo;t had a problem with fitting any of my bottles in it. It has a drawstring clamp to close the top around your bottle. The straps unhook if you don&rsquo;t want to carry it by them. It seems stitched pretty well, and I don&rsquo;t foresee any problems with it.Overall I&rsquo;m happy with this pretty water carrying bag.I was provided this product free for evaluation, my honest opinion, and review of the product.</p>

<h5 id="cool-stuff">~ Cool Stuff ~</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Red Butterfly 750ML Water Sport Bottle Cover Pouch Insulated Soft Sleeve Holder Case +Shoulder Strap by: ProfessionalBags is EXACTLY what I was looking for! As an avid walker in Southern California, I needed a way to keep my water bottle cold for my up to 10 mile walks in very hot temps. It was impossible to keep a water bottle cold while simply holding it in my hot hands - even if I had it frozen to begin with. And I&rsquo;m not the type that buys an expensive, reusable water bottle that I have to wash. I slip this cozy on my <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> frozen water bottle when I start my walk, and by the end of my walk (1-2 hrs later), I have to actually take the bottle out of the cozy because there is still a block of frozen water inside, which I need to melt so I can drink it! I chose this style over a zip model because a lot of reviews mentioned the zipper breaking. Plus, with this toggle, it&rsquo;s able to fit more different sizes of water bottles. (fits up to a 34oz water bottle)Product Description:~Pros~- Lightweight.- Screen Printing is high quality.- Great stitching.- Neoprene can help to keep your beverage cold or hot.- Quality materials~Cons~-NONE!!!~100% brand new Neoprene bag~Includes shoulder strap,soft,Waterproof,Light and comfortable~Washable,easy to dry, Never Fade~Dimension :length: 21cm,width: 11.5cm,Thickness: 3mm, Diameter: 7cm approx <em>Please measure your bottle to make sure it will fit before bidding</em>~Compatible with :750ML Water BottleOverall a great product and I highly recommend to any/all that use a water bottle on a daily basis and do not want the hassle of holding all the time.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinion are based on personal use and are not in any way influenced by the seller.</p>

<h5 id="poor-stitching">Poor stitching</h5>

<p>The first time I put my 16 oz. water bottle into it, the stitching at the neck ripped out. The stitching is poor quality.</p>
