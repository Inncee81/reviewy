<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="lightweight-and-does-a-solid-job-of-keeping-batteries-ready-for-action">Lightweight and does a solid job of keeping batteries ready for action.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this charger for a Nikon Coolpix S7000 Nikon Coolpix S7000 16 MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 3-Inch LCD (Black). The camera&rsquo;s standard method of charging is to charge the batteries in the camera. My wife and I travel often and take lots of pictures. We wanted spare batteries and a charger separate from the camera to be sure the camera was always ready to go. This charger works great and the batteries seem to function as well as the original Nikon battery.Some reviewers have said the batteries don&rsquo;t fit correctly into the charger. They must be placed into the charger with the brand label facing down. The attached photos show 1) the charger is designed for more than one battery, 2 and 3) the contacts line up correctly when the brand label faces down, and 4 and 5) the contacts do not align when the battery is inserted with the brand label facing up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-nikon-w100">Great for Nikon W100</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well for my Nikon W100 camera battery. Batteries are compatible. Relatively quick charge. Please with purchase. Haven&rsquo;t used the protective film yet. Will update if I ever do, though I didn&rsquo;t purchase for the protective film. It was just a bonus with a package that was the best value for what I needed - an extra battery or two and a wall charger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-when-batteries-are-placed-correctly-which-is-easy-to-figure-out-thru-trial-and-error">Works great when batteries are placed correctly which is easy to figure out thru trial and error.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wall Charger works great when batteries are placed in it correctly. Every camera battery is different so you have to use trial and error. You&rsquo;ll know if they aren&rsquo;t placed correctly and charging as light will be green as if already charged. Should be red to charge them. Haven&rsquo;t tried screen protector or cleaning cloth. Seems like you would need liquid of some sort with cleaning cloth to clean off oily fingerprints but haven&rsquo;t tried.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="big-name-manufacturer-great-buy">Big Name Manufacturer - great buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my Nikon S3100 and could not be more pleased. The kit is comprehensive, as shown in the product description, even including a more powerful 1000MH battery. What I wanted was a charging unit which plugged directly into a wall outlet and since I travel quite a bit the EU style plug adapter and 220V is a big plus. For the price it cannot be beaten. You&rsquo;re not buying junk from some dodgy manufacturer.One note: it&rsquo;s counter intuitive perhaps, but the battery needs to be inserted into the charger with the caution notice facing out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-battery-terrible-lcd-screen-protector">Great Battery - Terrible LCD Screen Protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased the battery kit along with the LCD screen protector. The battery is great (fits in my Nikon S7000 camera perfect). The battery seems to last about as long as the original Nikon battery and also gives the battery charge read out on the LCD screen (which some of these non-OEM batteries do not). As for the LCD protector &ndash; it is junk &ndash; plain and simple. It is difficult to put on, and is not clear once it is on the LCD (kind of hazy). I would give the battery 5 stars but one star for the LCD protector. I hope this review is helpful. If so, hit the helpful tab under the review.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="alot-for-your-money">ALOT FOR YOUR MONEY!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked online for a new battery for my Nikon camera. Some places didn&rsquo;t have the one I needed, and others that did have it were very expensive. When I found this site, I found the battery I needed at one third the cost and even included a microfiber cleaning cloth and screen protectors for the screen on my camera! What a deal! On top of that, it was delivered within a week. Would highly recommend this business!!! Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-way-to-show-battery-level">NO WAY TO SHOW BATTERY LEVEL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure this is working or not because lamp doesn&rsquo;t blink or change color. They show always STEADY GREEN LIGHT either without battery or with full charged battery or non-charged battery. There is NO WAY TO RECOGNIZE HOW FULLY BATTERY IS CHARGED!! This confused me. I thought it was charged fully over night but it wasn&rsquo;t badly on the beach next day. Desperately!! Not recommended if you need to charge battery quickly on vacation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-at-a-great-price">Great product at a great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This battery was what I needed for a spare to carry with my Nikon S3100. It looks just like the Nikon battery and it performs just like it. There is no need to pay full list price for the OEM version of this battery.The vendor shipped my order very quickly and even cared enough to follow up with me to make sure that I was satisfied with the product. The vendor is very professional, so give them a try.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This charger does not work for Nikon S33 as stated in listing. I will be returning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="batteries-worked-with-the-camera-but-the-charger-did-not">Batteries worked with the camera but the charger did not &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Batteries worked with the camera but the charger did not fit the batteries and cord did not work with either the charger or camera</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Item as described</p>

<h5 id="good-deal">good deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great pack</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-trying-to-figure-out">I am trying to figure out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The charger pack came in good time but the batteries fit the camera but it seems to be the wrong size for the batteries</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="light-is-confusing">Light is confusing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is a little confusing as the light is always green, even when I put a flat battery in to charge. But it shipped in a timely fashion and was what I expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Meet our expectations worked as advertised and arrived on time. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-expected">as expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>exactly as expected</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="toc_20">❤️</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my travel camera! I don&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of juice when I have a fully charged spare</p>
