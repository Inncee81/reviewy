<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-product-for-indoor-outdoor">Perfect product for indoor/outdoor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly want I wanted. did hours of research to find the best one without breaking the bank. The spandex screen with zipper bottom keeps the screen rinkle free and after first time assembly it only takes about ten minutes from start to finish. Can be assembled with only one person. Would recommend two for hanging the screen just because of sheer size</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-for-one-person-to-setup-and-take-down">Easy for one person to setup and take down</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy for one person to setup and take down. The carrying bag is great too. The first night we used it the wind was about 10-15 mph with gust to 25. Using only the stakes thru the base the screen stayed in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="from-ugh-to-amazing">From ugh to amazing!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second screen I have purchased from silver ticket. My first being an indoor 110&rdquo; screen and now this for our outdoor events. I loved my first screen which rivals screens 4x its cost. I decided based on my first experience to go with this unit. When the unit arrived and I put it together I ran into a couple issues. I had the honeycomb spots on the screen as mentioned by other reviewers and one of my posts did not quite line up. Disappointed, I considered returning until I decided to contact their support email just to see what would happen. Within a hour I had a response back to my experience I had left for them. I was shocked!! Shortly after that I received a follow up email with confirmation of a new screen and pole being sent out with tracking numbers. Now while having to wait a few days for replacement parts, I am just grateful I chose this product from a company that&rsquo;s stands behind their product with such quick customer follow up. From what I saw when I first put it together there is no doubt this will make an excellent portable screen for my family to use. Can&rsquo;t wait and thank you silver ticket!</p>

<h5 id="it-is-an-excellent-product-the-fame-is-light-weight-and-the">It is an excellent product, the fame is light weight and the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to show outdoor movies for my children/family/friends. The screen came with some damage. I contacted the seller and they overnighted a new screen so that my children&rsquo;s first showing was not delayed. It is an excellent product, the fame is light weight and the screen is made of a nice elastic type material. The negative review stating that the bottom of the screen is curved is due to the purchaser not setting the screen up right. There is a zipper on the bottom of the screen that zips over the lower horizontal bar to ensure the screen does not curve. Great product, highly recommend based on the quality of the frame and the customer service by Silver Ticket Product.</p>

<h5 id="well-we-first-opened-the-bag-to-put-it">Well, we first opened the bag to put it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, we first opened the bag to put it together and there were many pieces! A few of them had elastic inside, meaning that they were supposed to be all attached. But when we were trying to assemble them, they were pieces that did not go together but they were attached with the last stick so we had to cut the elastic and figure out a new way to put it together. It was a hassle. So after we managed to figure it out and mix and match the pieces, it was OK. And what is shown in the pictures, in comparison to what we got were different.</p>

<h5 id="not-at-all-worth-the-money-sad-but-true">not at all worth the money. sad but true</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>when the item is called &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; that;s what they mean. it&rsquo;s a spandex material and not very sturdy or safe around kids or dirt. 100% the lowest quality item I think they make. let down for sure. elites DIYseries is much much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-and-seller">Excellent Product and Seller!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fantastic screen to use in the backyard. We ordered it to show a movie at our elementary school. It was easy to set-up and for our purpose a fantastic way to show an outdoor movie. Silver Ticket Products Company has excellent customer service. My screen had slight marks on it which made it distracting to watch the movie on. I contacted the seller and they immediately rectified the situation and sent me out a new screen. Excellent customer service. I would highly recommend this product and company.</p>

<h5 id="old-bedsheet-don-t-buy">Old Bedsheet&hellip;.Don&rsquo;t buy!!!!</h5>
