<h5 id="it-is-so-thin-and-flexible-and-actually-makes-typing-feel-better-it-stays-in-place">It is so thin and flexible and actually makes typing feel better. It stays in place</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased as Acer Chromebook 11 and wanted to protect the keyboard. I bought the GMYLE silicon keyboard cover. I was skeptical and worried that it would be too thick ant flexible enough. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived yesterday. It is so thin and flexible and actually makes typing feel better. It stays in place, does not interfere with the closure of the Chromebook and it definitely a must have. Plus the color sparks up my all white Chromebook!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="durable-and-useful-product-that-makes-typing-comfortable-and-quiet-4-5-stars">Durable and Useful Product that Makes Typing Comfortable and Quiet! 4.5 Stars.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to say that I really like this keyboard protector and find it very useful. I originally purchased it to make my typing more quiet, as I have a tendency to &ldquo;bang&rdquo; on the keys. While it does not make my typing completely silent (I don&rsquo;t think any protector can), the noise is significantly reduced. I am able to bang away on my Chromebook even in the &ldquo;quiet study&rdquo; areas of the library without disturbing others.It takes some time getting used to typing with the protector on the keyboard &ndash; maybe a couple of hours. But after that, that is very comfortable. I find typing to be more enjoyable and the keys to be more &ldquo;springy&rdquo; with the protector on. The material feels rubbery but soft to the touch. It becomes smoother the more often you use it as it absorbs the oils from your fingers. It is certainly a better (thicker) quality than the protectors I first tried on Ebay for $1-$5.It has been nearly 10 months since my purchase and it is still going strong. The silicone rubber has not torn or gone out of shape, despite being washed 6 or 7 times. It still adheres very well to the keyboard and does not fall off unless I turn the Chromebook upside down. Once on, the protector does not shift or slide underneath your fingers even when typing fast.However, the bright gold/champagne color of the protector has worn off significantly &ndash; it is only half as bright and vivid as it was when I first received it. The black color of the keys underneath is showing through, but when I first used it, you could not tell what color the keys underneath were (see picture for reference).The white lettering has also held up well, but is starting to wear off on some of the most used keys (see the pictures): E, S, N, I, A. This is with constant, daily use (3-4 hours a day). If you are touch typist, however, this will not matter to you. Though aesthetically it might not look so pretty.I cannot say anything regarding the protective qualities of the product. I haven&rsquo;t spilled anything on the Chromebook. But it has kept my keyboard underneath very clean and spotless.Overall, a great product, that has held up well under constant daily use and will probably last you as long as your Chromebook, or longer. There are not a lot of products out there which you can say that about. I only wish the price were lower so that I can purchase another one in a different color. 4.5 stars for with points docked off for color fading and wear on the lettering.</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is perfect!!! I have a white Chromebook, so all of the little hairs, dirt or crumbs getting in the keyboard are very noticeable. Therefore, I&rsquo;m always keeping it as clean as possible, but this can be annoying. Soooo, I bought myself this product!! The price is reasonable, and it comes as pictured. The gold looks good on the computer and it fits nice and snug. The gold is bronze-ish, but it is still gold. That&rsquo;s why I gave this product 4 stars. As with any keyboard cover, it takes a little bit of getting used to to type on it, but that&rsquo;s to be expected and that is temporary. Shipping was reasonable as well. Thanks!</p>

<h5 id="meh">Meh&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had this product for about 6 months now and I&rsquo;m not too pleased with it. First off, the color of the cover is not nearly as bright as pictured; I know that I&rsquo;ve had it for a while so it might just be that it&rsquo;s dulled from using it a lot, but it the color was similar to what it is now when I first received it. Also, within just the first day of using the keyboard cover, I noticed that the color wore off VERY easily. I would&rsquo;ve expected this to happen after weeks of heavy use, but just within the first day I noticed that there were dark marks on the individual keys from where the color had worn off slightly (so that I could see the black keys underneath). Also, another big thing for me that I really don&rsquo;t like about the it is that it the color from the letters of the keyboard cover transfers onto the laptop screen (since I keep my laptop closed most of the day when I&rsquo;m not using it). It&rsquo;s easy to get off with water and a paper towel, but it&rsquo;s still really annoying to see (see attached picture). I gave it two stars instead of one because it fits the keyboard for this laptop pretty well and it hasn&rsquo;t ripped or anything like that. Other than that&hellip;eh. I&rsquo;m not sure if this happens with the other colors that they have, but the gold colored one is definitely not the one you want.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-feel-right-at-all-when-typing-with-this">Does not feel right at all when typing with this.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This keyboard cover looks great, but from certain angles (with laptop right in front of me as I&rsquo;m using it) the black key color bleeds through the edges of the keyboard cover.When I&rsquo;m typing I feel the key cover lifting? from the key and it definitely does not feel pleasant or natural. It&rsquo;s almost as if the key cover is a loose glove which was not what I was expecting. I looked up reviews for silicone keyboard covers before making this purchase and I don&rsquo;t think people typically have this issue.I&rsquo;m going to try this out for a couple more days and see if the &lsquo;fit&rsquo; gets any better or else I might just send this back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="function-greater-than-form">Function greater than form.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great for keeping all the little debris of life out of your keyboard, also it totally deflected a major coffee spill today. The color does wear off really quickly, you can event see on mine finer lines where mostly a fingernail hits the key and the black keys show through so it looks grungy, but whatever. It makes typing quieter for sure, and saved my work computer for an untimely coffee spill assassination, worth it for those two things. Only suggestion would be to make them without color so it doesn&rsquo;t look gross when the color starts wearing off/disappoint people who were excited about having blinged out gold keys.</p>

<h5 id="great-attractive-protection">Great attractive protection.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very attractive way to keep dust and particles out of your keyboard. Makes my little chromebook have a little class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>total waste of money. It is very short and doesn&rsquo;t provide the protection needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-pretty-but-not-usable">It&rsquo;s pretty, but not usable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter just took it off her keyboard. It does not fit and stay on all that well. It&rsquo;s pretty, but not usable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-keyboard">Awesome Keyboard!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits my Acer Chromebook so well and makes my typing quiet!I would definitely recommend for people who love lots of colors and a softer texture on your keyboard</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-fit-acer-chromebook-11">DOES NOT FIT ACER CHROMEBOOK 11</h5>
