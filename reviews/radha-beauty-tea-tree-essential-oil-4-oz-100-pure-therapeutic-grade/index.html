<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-works">It works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Simply AMAZING! I just received this product TODAY. I bought it as an alternative to visiting a dermatologist to have a skin tag removed. Prior to purchasing this one I tried Tag Away with no results. In just one day there is a HUGE difference! See for yourself in the picture.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nail-fungus-disapearing">Nail fungus disapearing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After years of embarrassing nail fungus on my big toe I&rsquo;m happy to say my toe is <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> healed. Just the last <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; of nail is infected and I expect that to grow out in the next month or so. I&rsquo;ve been applying the oil 2-3 times a day for the last 2 months. Finally I can go barefoot with out feeling embarrassed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impressed-a-skeptic">Impressed a Skeptic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people who don&rsquo;t think much of natural remedies. If a pill or a shot will handle whatever ailment I&rsquo;ve got I&rsquo;ll take it. Against my nature, I decided to give this product a shot to clear up severe toenail fungus on both of my big toes. Wow am I impressed! Used in conjunction with a tree tea oil soap in the shower, this stuff began eating away the fungus within 2-3 weeks while leaving the healthy part of the nail alone. After 6 weeks I&rsquo;m almost completely fungus free. I&rsquo;ve been saturating the nail every night and sometimes 2x a day. Best results after filing down infected area and then applying oil. Highly recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="honest-review-from-a-discerning-buyer-please-read-great-stuff-organic-best-price-i-have-seen-for-a-pure-oil-many-uses"><strong>Honest Review from a Discerning Buyer-PLEASE READ: Great Stuff, Organic, Best Price I have seen for a Pure Oil</strong> Many Uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Real review and no I was not compensated or given discounts for it.I love this stuff and this is the real deal. Great price for such a large amount as well. I use this mixed with water in a spray bottle as an all purpose kitchen and bathroom cleaner and sanitizer. I also use it diluted with water as a great and effective mouthwash and I also squeeze a few drops in my homemade toothpaste of coconut oil and baking soda. I use a small amount mixed with Bragg&rsquo;s ACV as an excellent and gentle facial toner. (Please moisturize once face dries if you have naturally dry skin.) I put a few drops in my shampoo bottle as well to keep psoriasis of the scalp at bay (mine was really bad before I began using this regimen). I use it on my fiancee&rsquo;s feet in a foot soak that he loves and after 4 nights per week of tea tree oil foot soak with warm water, his toes look normal and fungus is gone! I also use a few drops in my homemade deodorant mixed with baking soda, cornstarch, and some coconut oil. I am an excessive and smelly sweater and the tea tree oil kills the sweat causing bacteria under my arms so there is no foul odor. Lasts at least 7-10 hours. I used to could not leave house without refreshing my deodorant every 3 hours. Tea tree oil is a god send. One of the best and most potent essential oils period. USE SPARINGLY! A lot goes a long way. I also use a little in laundry to freshen clothes and kill bacteria. It took me a while to post my review because I had to try it out and make sure it was effective and the real deal. I will now be a permanent customer.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-and-effectiveness-not-so-great-smell">Great value and effectiveness, not so great smell.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its great&hellip; it does what it is supposed to do for my skin (diluted) and other things I use it for like homemade cleaners&hellip;.. but the smell is that of pine-sol. It smells very much like a cleaner which isn&rsquo;t what I am used to from a Tea Tree essential oil. It is QUITE strong. With other essential oils Ive used the Tea Tree smell is more fresh and clean smelling where as this just smells like someone bottled up pine-sol. It works so I can complain for the price/amount you get its worth it but I won&rsquo;t be using this in my diffuser (which is part of the reason I wanted it) because of the wretched smell which I know now is from it being a really high concentrate of tea tree oil. If you have a tea tree oil that smells good most likely it isn&rsquo;t 100% pure tea tree oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stuff">Great stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This oil is fantastic, and with do almost anything. The reason for four stars is that the eye dropper that comes with the oil will not stay screwed onto the bottle. Did I just get a bad one? Maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="omg-this-stuff-kills-bugs-great">OMG!!! This stuff kills bugs, GREAT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff kills bugs!!! Depending on how you take this, it could be good or bad. I randomly found this out when I dropped sound drops on those black pincher bug with the pincher claws at the end and they died! Later, I caught a roach and threw it in the toilet so it was still alive and floating in the water. Decided to give this another try and bam a dead roach in under a minute. Considering this has been working for people with their conditions, this oil now serves another purpose. It doesn&rsquo;t have that chemical smell like other bug sprays, but the smell is rather potent. I have use this and I would say it works for certain treatments. I had a lot left since it stopped using it for a while and luckily found out another usage for this, bug killer spray! Kinda makes me wonder all the possibilities for the bug problems around the house lol like spraying this on an ant mound or wasp nest. I didn&rsquo;t want to post pictures of dead bugs on a treatment product for people usage, thought it would be odd. Try it and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>

<h5 id="a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words">&ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s been suffering from a fungus on his right hand for years. A friend of us recommended him this oil. He explained to him how wonderful this oil was for many things, and one of those things, was to cure fungus. I found it here on Amazon, and order for him.The item arrived July 19, we were in a cruce and got back home from it on July 24. Immediately he began to use it, this product is amazing, for the first time we see real results on his hand. &rsquo;m sharing some pictures. As the saying goes. &ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo;The first picture is from July 24, the last one is from July 30</p>

<h5 id="the-oil-is-great-however-as-other-buyers-have-posted-the-rubber-dropper">The oil is great however as other buyers have posted the rubber dropper &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The oil is great however as other buyers have posted the rubber dropper fell off rather quickly as a result of a chemical reaction from the oil itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective-oil-dropper">Defective Oil Dropper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The tea tree oil itself was fine. However, the top they provided with the oil dropper did not fit the bottle so I lost <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the bottle when it spilt in my bag. Waste of money.</p>
