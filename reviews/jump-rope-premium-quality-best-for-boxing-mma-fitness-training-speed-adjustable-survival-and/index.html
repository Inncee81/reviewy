<h5 id="very-good-rope-and-probably-the-best-value-on-amazon">Very Good Rope and Probably the Best Value on Amazon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â This is a good rope. I have been jump rope training for the better part of 20 years and have used every kind of rope imaginable, and I really like this one. First of all, it&rsquo;s a right angle-cable rope; common design for speed ropes. Great for speed skipping, double unders, triples, etc. These ropes are typically NOT great for variations like cross overs, side swings, etc. because the cables kink and bind at the handle. I was pleasantly surprised that this one doesn&rsquo;t do that. The grade of cable is just soft enough to allow some variations of hand position. The screw adjustment system works well and the handle design is good with the flange at the end, although I&rsquo;d prefer a handle that&rsquo;s about 1&rdquo; longer. All in all, a very good rope for it&rsquo;s purpose. I have this one in my gym bag along with two Buddy Lee Ropes (Areo Speed and Rope Master), a Jumpnrope.com R1 speed rope, and a basic beaded rope and for speed training, this is my go-to rope. And for the price, it&rsquo;s probably the best value on Amazon. I have attached a video review for anyone interested, and I recently used this rope to hit two PRs&hellip; max double unders in a minute at 130, and unbroken double unders at 210. Good product; happy to support it.</p>

<h5 id="handle-broke-from-rope-during-second-workout-ever">Handle broke from rope during second workout ever.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty sad. I was so excited to finally get this jumprope. It has such good reviews, and people seemed to love it. So it finally arrives, and i am really excited. This is exactly how it played out:Day 1: Received the product. Got an email from the company who made it letting me know that it was arriving today, and that if anything was wrong, feel free to replay to the email with any concerns or questions. I go to the gym, and try it out. It was fine, and i got my workout in. I did notice some lack of quality in the materials of the handle, because the handle was Super plasticy, and really light material; like something that comes from a super cheap kids&rsquo; toy.Day 3: I go to jump rope again, and after about 5 minutes, the handle just splits open and breaks from the rope. Just like that! My second time using the jumprope, and the handle split. my reaction: &mdash;_____&mdash;I thought, no worries, it happens; i replied to the email from the company that was sent earlier in the week, and i sent them what had happened, along with the exact pictures that I have posted here. All I asked was if they can replace the broken jumprope, so that I can try it again, or see if it was a one-off thing.I waited four days, and received no reply. Nothing. So this is where I am right now. I ordered another jumprope from another company, WOD, and their jumprope handle is of much higher quality, so i am going to try that now. For this one, I am simply going to return it back to amazon.I am sad that this company never gave itself a second chance&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="almost-like-a-burning-candle">Almost like a burning candle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At the start, this product exceeded my expectations as a speed rope. After 2 months of vigorous speed jumping, the outer plastic coating had worn down, exposing the metal wire inside. This in return caused the metal wire to wear down, to eventually become two seperate pieces&hellip; I&rsquo;m certainly no monster, but I had also hoped it could withstand torture from an active person.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-understand-the-high-score-of-this-rope">I don&rsquo;t understand the high score of this rope. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the high score of this rope. After about 10 times of use, the wire will be exposed and it&rsquo;s very dangerous! It can poke into your body! Be careful, this is a serious problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this rope to work on my double unders at Crossfit. It is good quality and easy to set up. You will need wire cutters to shorten it, but it is simple to do and the company has a video tutorial on their website. The rope itself is a cable with a plastic coating. I jump on a rubber mat so I&rsquo;ve had no issues with it fraying. I would probably stay away from rough concrete. After ordering this particular rope, I decided to order another item directly from their website. I had a small problem with the order, but it was very quickly resolved. The company is quick to respond to inquiries and i was impressed with the attention to customer service. Overall, a quality product from a quality company.</p>

<h5 id="great-speedy-durable-jump-rope">Great, speedy, durable jump rope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We search a lot for the right jump rope for my wife and I. The reason we chose this one was because of the material it was made of and ability to adjust the jump rope to our size. It has a durable thick rubber costing and strong wire/metal interior. As we are both under 5&rsquo;7, finding the right jump rope at an affordable price and still maintain quality was not easy. Once we got the jump rope we followed the directions given in an email to make sure the rope was the right size. Very easy to do.It took us time to get use to jump roping at the speed this one allows. Most other jump rope we tried don&rsquo;t allow us to go as fast as we wanted since the rope and handle are fixed and do not move independently like this one.The handle design makes sure it won&rsquo;t slip out of your hands if you get a lot of speed going.We use it everyday for 10 min each and it&rsquo;s great. We jump rope outside and durability is great. Although we jump rope on concrete we will be using a mat as I recommend not jumping on an abrasive surface. It&rsquo;s not good for the longevity of any jump rope. It also helps they back it up with a lifetime warranty.Overall it&rsquo;s fast, durable, flexible to use for people of different heights.We love it</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-setup-with-a-personal-touch">Easy to setup, with a personal touch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The handles are lighter than I expected and the hardware is simple and easy to use. I am an average height male and was able to make a small adjustment using only the hardware on the rope itself to make it fit me perfectly. No cutting was required. It is a really excellent thing that they include an addition set of hardware - I guess in case you lose or damage what comes on the handle/rope itself. I received a personalized email thanking me for my purchase and I get these sense from the communications that the company truly cares about solving my fitness needs through providing tools and service that exceed expectations. I am impressed and grateful I purchased.</p>

<h5 id="plastic-parts-are-made-to-break">Plastic parts are made to break</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After only a few workouts the plastic part connecting the handle to the rope broke in half. This apparently is pretty common as I read down through the reviews.</p>

<h5 id="solid-jump-rope-with-an-innovative-design">Solid jump rope with an innovative design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the design of the rope and it proved fairly effective on my first time around with it. My only tiny gripe with that the screws that come with the rope to extend or retract&hellip;</p>

<p>Absolutely love this jump rope.I was in a workout slump and always loved jumping rope. This rope is so light and I love the adjustable length. I&rsquo;m finally back on track.</p>
