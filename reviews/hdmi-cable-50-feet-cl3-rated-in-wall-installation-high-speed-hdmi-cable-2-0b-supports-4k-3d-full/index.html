<h5 id="i-ve-been-looking-for-the-best-way-to-connect-my-desktop-pc-in-the-third">&ndash;I&rsquo;ve been looking for the best way to connect my desktop PC in the third &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Short Review:&ndash;The 100 foot HDMI cable works perfectly for my setup, with no signal degradation at all.Full Review:&ndash;I&rsquo;ve been looking for the best way to connect my desktop PC in the third floor master bedroom to my home theater setup in the second floor living room and have tried several different methods prior to this purchase with less than ideal results. In addition to audio, video, and general web browsing I also do a lot of high resolution gaming and needed a solution that would allow me to play at my desk or on my TV without losing any visual fidelity. I first tried Steam&rsquo;s In-Home Streaming method, but there were noticeable moments of a/v latency. I then purchased a 50 foot HDMI cable from Amazon, which provided perfect sound and picture and ended up using that for over a year. But the cable was only just barely able to reach between the devices and had to be draped over the corner of the couch, so it wasn&rsquo;t going to work long term. After doing more research online, I looked into a HDMI via Cat5/6 method and purchased a Sewell Extender set that advertised the ability to convert the signal from the source through HDMI to Ethernet and then back to HDMI at the receiver up to a length of 200 feet. However, this did not work at all for me and after a lot of troubleshooting and testing a number of cables/lengths, I decided to return it and continue looking for other options. That&rsquo;s when I decided to take a gamble on this single 100 foot HDMI. I had stayed away from cables this long previously because it seemed that the general consensus was that the signal degrades after about 50 feet. But seeing as how this one had a booster built in and reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot. The package arrived very quickly and in good condition. Connected the cable, being sure to make note of the input and output ends, and the picture and sound came through perfectly without any signal degradation, artifacts, or latency. Works great! Now I can run the cable along the edges of the walls and behind bookshelves to keep it mostly out of sight.Hopefully this review will be helpful to anyone looking for a similar solution but has been wary of purchasing a cable this long.My components:&ndash;Desktop PC with nVidia GeForce 970 HDMI output &ndash;&gt; Ultra Clarity 100 foot HDMI 2.0 cable &ndash;&gt; Panlong HDMI Switch 5 x 1 &ndash;&gt; short HDMI cable &ndash;&gt; Samsung 60&rsquo; 1080p LED LCD TV</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the 40 foot cable to connect my laptop to my 60 inch Samsung Smart TV nearly 40 feet away. I&rsquo;ve hidden the cable behind furniture (only wish it was offered in black) and I&rsquo;m very happy with the clarity. I&rsquo;ve lost very little in clarity and speed. It is a heavy duty cable that carries the signal and sound very well. I would believe it would handle a printer/scanner/fax with no problems. I absolutely love this cable and would advise others to just buy it. My experience so far has been flawless&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 40 feet I have had trouble with other cables getting a good consistent signal to my three HDMI high def TVs. These work great and give me all of the extra features of a &ldquo;smart TV&rdquo; that I wanted. I highly recommend them as an economical, quality answer long run cabling. Don&rsquo;t try multiple shorter- run .cables. You are doomed to failure.</p>

<h5 id="the-cable-seems-to-be-a-good-mix-of-affordable-and-reliable">The cable seems to be a good mix of affordable and reliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 40&rsquo; cable started out working very intermittently (sending 1080p 60 hz to my projector). Passing it through my surround receiver made it not work at all. And when it did work (directly from my computer), it was hyper-sensitive to the cable being moved and would disconnect, show red and green dots spread out on the screen, and other issues that are usually related to signal degradation.However, I saw someone in the reviews mentioned that the cable needs to be in the right direction. What??? I never had any idea that an HDMI cable could be direction. In any case, I flipped the cable around and have had 100% solid signal ever since, even when being passed through my receiver. The cable seems to be a good mix of affordable and reliable. The strain reliefs are sufficient and the cable itself is quite thick.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-if-you-know-what-you-re-doing">Works great if you know what you&rsquo;re doing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent cable, great competitive price, works excellent after proper setup.We had minor issues, but they were expected. 100ft HDMI cables are already stretching the limit for the spec and really require an active cable such as this. That said, we were not running the cable directly from the source to the display, but rather were doing an in-wall installation, where the source uses a cable to a wall jack, the 100ft cable was an internal wall run cable to another wall jack, and then another cable from the wall jack to the display. This means you are running MORE than the 100ft (2x wall plates that usually have a 6&rdquo; female cable on the inside, and 2ft cables from source to wall and from wall to display). This means our total run was 105ft, plus 6 interchanges instead of 2. This can cause issues regardless of the cable you use, so I cannot knock the cable for it at all.Make sure you use the cable in the right direction (active cables regenerate a signal and &ldquo;push&rdquo; the data in a specific direction and are labelled &ldquo;source&rdquo; and &ldquo;display/TV&rdquo; on their respective ends), and double check that the source device you are using supports the resolution you are trying to output to the display (we were using a micro computer to power two displays in separate rooms and had to go into the BIOS and set which output was the main output to enable a larger resolution on one display than the other. Check with your manufacturer&rsquo;s user manual for this info)</p>
