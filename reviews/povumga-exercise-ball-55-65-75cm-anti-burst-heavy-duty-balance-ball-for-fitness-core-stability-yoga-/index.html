<h5 id="great-for-strengthening-core-and-also-for-releiving-stress-and-lower-back-pain">Great for strengthening core and also for releiving stress and lower back pain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I decided to break down and get this exercise ball as an aid in my abdomen workouts at home. I’ve used them often at the gym during classes and love the emphasis they put on the muscles I am working. This exercise ball is made extra thick, very durable, and easy to inflate. I feel safe putting all my weight on this and my favorite stretch is laying with my back on and arched around the ball. This exercise ball really works and strengthens your core and also helps you target those muscles that require strengthening after pregnancy. There are so many exercises you can do using this ball that will help you strengthen, tone, and increase balance. ** I rely heavily on reviews from others when purchasing items online so I try to be as thorough and honest in giving my opinion as possible. I appreciate your feedback, so if you have found my review helpful, please take a moment to click on &ldquo;yes” to let me know. **</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-ball-i-use-it-as-a-chair-when">This is a great ball. I use it as a chair when &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After browsing a bewildering assortment of balance/stability balls from different manufacturers, I settled on this Povumga exercise ball. In a word, it&rsquo;s fabulous. This is a great ball. I use it as a chair when I&rsquo;m working long hours at my computer. It is very sturdy and holds up very well and I have no fear of it breaking under me. I feel the difference it makes in my back and leg fatigue, and my muscles feel better now after a long day&rsquo;s work. You will be very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="one-for-three">One for three</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice ball. Everybody at our home tried this exercise ball already, even my little son got to sit on the ball with a support. For him, it is a new funny toy. But for my hubby and me, it is a great exercise ball. It is so solid and strong that it can easily support my hubby and my son&rsquo;s weight, almost 200 lbs. Since it arrived, every night we spent some time sitting on it, which did help train our back muscles. And this in some way relieves my hubby&rsquo;s lower back pain. I am also going to restart my yoga classes, so now I have my own yoga ball and I don&rsquo;t need to share the ones in classes.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent and well-made yoga ball that was easy to inflate. I purchased this item to do some exercises in the home, I was pleasantly surprised at how well made and durable this exercise ball was. It is far superior to even the balls that I found in my gym. The pump that was included made it easy to inflate the item and the instructions gave me peace of mind that I would not risk over-inflating the item so long as I used the pump. You will be very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="yoga-ball-good-for-muscle-training">Yoga ball good for muscle training</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Package arrived as expected. This yoga ball came with a pump,for blowing it up, that takes time to get it done. My back and knees have been hurting long time, as advised by physical therapist, I bought this yoga ball to train the mucsul of my back, laps and legs , by doing a series excise with it. When my back lying on the ball, I can hear the crack sound for my back, after excise, feeling loose and comfort. I think it helps.</p>
