<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="changes-don-t-work">changes don&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting those on auto-delivery for a couple of years now, used to be happy with spending a bit more for a stronger bag (I use them for diapers of special needs adolescents, that gets very heavy). The last time I got them though I noticed they changed. Now they keep breaking - it is very unpleasant to say the least to pick up dirty diapers from the alley way. Whatever they changed, they shouldn&rsquo;t have. I&rsquo;ll cancel my subscription and buy cheaper bags instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-happy-with-the-quality-or-the-scent">Not happy with the quality or the scent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I usually use Hefty bags with Odor Block, but I wanted to try the Force Flex bags, and was expecting to love the Gain scented ones. My husband loves the scent of Gain detergent, so I also thought he&rsquo;d like these bags. They do NOT smell anything like the detergent. Also, the flap that keeps the drawstring attached to the bag unfolds almost every time&hellip; even when the trash bag is not very heavy.It&rsquo;s very annoying when you are removing the trash bag from the bin or trying to tie it closed and then the drawstring comes detached from the bag!! Will not be buying these again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="need-sheild-from-the-scent-itself">Need Sheild From The Scent Itself</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We all know how garbage smells, well the scent to these bags are awful. It was so strong I was hit by the smell as soon as I opened my subscribe and save box. (There was food in my box too luckily only the outer packaging was scented.) The best two ways I can think to describe the scent : It reminds me of a romance novel when they describe a women&rsquo;s perfume as cheap and enters the room before she does. Maybe the discount perfume counter that nauseated you because they all don&rsquo;t mix together so the garbage smell plus the bag smell is the proverbial putting perfume on a pig.I tried using them thinking one bag at a time wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. This was not the case. Until I could get new bags I was dealing with itchy watery eyes as they triggered my allergies &amp; headaches (I have used Fabreeze for years with no problems on Fabrics). Had to get them into the garage felt like I needed a resporator mask. Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-kitchen-and-the-yard">Great for the kitchen and the yard!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will only use force flex trash bags from now on. It makes such a difference. They stretch instead on ripping and dumping the trash all over the floor. It is especially helpful in the kitchen. The kitchen trash tends to be smaller, heavier items and when you take the bag out of the can it doesn&rsquo;t rip. The old trash bags would usually tear either at the bottom or at the top where I was trying to pull it out of the can. I also love the febreze scent and it really does help to cover gross trash smells. It&rsquo;s also not overly scented to where it is overwhelming. I&rsquo;ve also started to use the Force Flex for yard waste. It really stretches and holds a ton of stuff. They can still tear if there is a sharp object that pokes the outside, but not as easily as plain trash bags.</p>

<h5 id="nice-strong-bags">nice, strong bags</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband is the grocery shopper in our family, and he does a great job on groceries. Unfortunately, he often forgets to buy things like paper towels, toilet paper, paper plates and garbage bags. I would sometimes stop at the local convenience store on my way home from work to pick these up. But this uses my time, plus they are expensive. I have found the answer through Amazon’s auto delivery – all these items come right to my door and are a great price! Plus I get 15% off because I order more than five things. These plastic bags for garbage are fantastic! They are thick and hold all of my kitchen garbage. I have not had them split on me…..ever. And I fill the bag up &ndash; the whole 13 gallons. The other nice thing is that they have a pleasant smell to them, so it helps control odor. (Particularly in the kitchen where I tend to use these most often). I also use these bags for a large trash can in my bedroom and for one in the office. I plan to keep on ordering these through auto delivery.</p>

<h5 id="my-trash-bags-need-to-be-durable-because-there-is-nothing-i-hate-more-than-a-trash-bag-that-tears-on-me">My trash bags need to be durable because there is NOTHING I hate more than a trash bag that tears on me &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I am weird with many things and when it comes to trash bags well I am still strange. As the sole person in my family of six to actually get off my toosh and do any work I want to make sure my bag is going to survive anything I throw it&rsquo;s way. My trash bags need to be durable because there is NOTHING I hate more than a trash bag that tears on me causing me to rebag everything and causing me to get behind on my housework. Glad forceflex bags have ALWAYS been my go to bags even if they are a little more expensive than other brands. At my local store I spend about 70 percent of what I spent on this LARGE box for only 23 bags. So I saved a bunch of money shopping with Amazon! Also, Glad recently started using febreze in their bags which help my trash smell wonderful throughout the time it gets to stay with me!</p>

<h5 id="great-for-special-types-of-trash">Great for special types of trash.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using Glad tall kitchen trash bags for a long time for kitchen garbage bin liners. But I needed a tough bag like these for cleaning out drawers and bins of computer and electrical wiring. I have accumulated many pounds of this type wiring over the years but now need to get rid of all that stuff. The normal kitchen plastic trash bags just can not hold this type of wiring without breaking but the Glad Force Flex bags are exactly what I needed. - no more breaking out of the bag.</p>

<h5 id="awful-compared-to-the-cheaper-off-brand-bags">Awful compared to the cheaper off brand bags!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worst bags I&rsquo;ve ever bought&hellip; I usually buy Berkeley Jenson generic off brands for about 4-5$ cheaper and this time decided I&rsquo;d go with these because I have a one year old and&hellip;</p>
