<h5 id="after-a-2-week-trip-with-my-new-gopro-my-conclusions">After a 2-week trip with my new GoPro, my conclusions&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve just come back from a trip for a couple weeks and put this camera to the test, it&rsquo;s now time for an honest review. Thinking back on my usage experience and reviewing my footage, here are my conclusions:PROS1. This little camera is so easy to pack, carry, and use &ndash; one can quickly get some nice wide-angle video and pictures, at those times when you suddenly see something you want to shoot.2. The wide angle lens makes it easy to point and shoot, as wherever you point you will be covering most of the view &ndash; and some of your shots will be stunning.3. Being able to take this camera in the ocean/water makes for some great swimming and snorkeling shots.4. The microphone works quite well also, picking up a fair bit of detail, as long as there is not too much extra noise around you.CONS1. This camera works very poorly for low light conditions &ndash; my night footage is not useable.2. This camera works very poorly for hand held moving shots &ndash; I filmed a lot just by holding onto a mounting accessory &ndash; any slight movement made pictures blurry (and useless) and videos hard to watch due to all the shaking. I will use it more in a mounted capacity in the future.3. No LCD viewer &ndash; of course it would be easier with an LCD screen on the back showing what you are taking, even a very rudimentary one &ndash; but the wide angle lens makes it pretty easy to guess.4. My new product did arrive with a couple of manufacturing imperfections (see pictures), which you&rsquo;d never expect for a company of this size. Of course they have no bearing on the camera&rsquo;s functionality (and don&rsquo;t contribute to my rating), but do speak about the company&rsquo;s supply chain and/or QA.Pictures: a) beneath the clear case the grey plastic has a dimple in itb) some plastic has been crudely shaved off the waterproof backdoor</p>

<h5 id="basic-and-affordable">Basic and affordable 👍</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I went and purchased this camera two days after it came out. I am new to the GoPro cams but I have done plenty of research on the cameras. Although this camera might not be the best out of there line, it sure did meet my needs and of course, my tight budget. It is super basic, even I knew how to work it, without even having held a GoPro before in my life . For the little filming here and there that I do, this little thing fits the bill forsure. One con is that the camera is non-removable from the case. Even though I knew about it before I purchased it, I didn&rsquo;t think I would mind. Now with using it, and knowing if the case breaks then basically the camera breaks, makes me a little more cautious then I would be with say one of the other Heros that I can simply just replace the case on. So besides being a little more protective of this Hero, I love the camera. For someone who wants something basic, super affordable, clear pics/vids, or for an extra camera on hand, it is perfect.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have only test &ldquo;flown&rdquo; my GoPro as yet. It looks good. I recently went on a cruise where my wife and I went ziplining for the first time. All I had was my cellphone to take videos. I now have two of these cameras (price SO reasonable) with headstraps. We are planning on going on the Apache Windrider zip line at Ski Apache near Ruidoso, New Mexico in July. It is over 8000 feet long in three segments over some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the U.S. The first segment is the longest in the lower 48. My wife and I will both have these helmet-mounted GoPros to record the ride and each other as we zip. I have downloaded the Wondershare video editor to put together a nice video for my Facebook page. I am thinking Steppenwolf&rsquo;s Magic Carpet Ride for a soundtrack. All from a small, affordable multifunction camera!</p>

<h5 id="great-camera">Great Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this camera during Black Friday for Christmas. Only recently used it&hellip; and boy is it great. I bought it mainly to record motorcycle rides and possibly cycling trips too. Although this entry-level camera doesn&rsquo;t have the additional perks it&rsquo;s more expensive siblings have, it works great.While on my motorcycle I wouldn&rsquo;t use the WiFi features. Nor would I use my phone to start/ stop recording. For my purposes, this model is great. When the memory card fills, I simply upload the videos to my computer. One drawback is the size of the memory card. I believe the camera only supports up to 32 gigs. The fact that I can&rsquo;t remove the camera from its plastic housing doesn&rsquo;t concern me. Again, for my purposes, this camera checks all the marks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-for-the-low-price">Great value for the low price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for 99% of what I want to use it for. If you accept the few shortcomings to save a LOT of money then it&rsquo;s a no-brainer. I wish I could plug an external mic into it directly, but I get better quality running separate audio with a Tascam DR-05 anyway, it just takes a bit more work editing.Honestly who really wants to shoot 1080p at 120fps? Have you tried editing with those file sizes? I use the 720p at 60fps for motorcycle videos and the quality is not distinguishable unless you zoom in or are watching on a giant screen. I&rsquo;m glad they made a nice small light entry-level GoPro as now I have purchased all sorts of GoPro accessories that will still work if I ever decide to spring for their top of the line models.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-go-pro-for-a-budget">Great go-pro for a budget.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 15 year old has had this a while now and has so much fun with it! He wanted to newer model but we had to work with a budget so he got this and it ended up being a very good deal. He&rsquo;s gone underwater, taken it to the soccer field and ziplined with it. Just to mention a few things. I think he also brought it to the golf course and on some rides at a local theme park. The videos are great fun to watch and I think go-pro is such a cool invention for techy kids and adults. I find no need for the more advanced models unless you use it very often so the regular hero is a good starting point.</p>
