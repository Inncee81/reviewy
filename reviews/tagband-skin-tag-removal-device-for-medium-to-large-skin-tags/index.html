</ul>

<p>TagBand&rsquo;s patent pending design is the only skin tag removal device available on the marketplace with its clever, innovative design allowing for quick and safe skin tag removal. TagBand works by stopping the skin tags blood supply and results can be seen within just a few days of applying a band. The bands are suitable for medium to large sized skin tags. The TagBand kit is suitable for skin tags with a widest point of 4mm-6mm. TagBand is designed to be used on skin tags on the face and body but we wouldnâ€™t recommend using it around the sensitive eye area. All orders come boxed and include 1 x TagBand cone, 1 x TagBand remover, 10 x TagBands + 10 TagBands extra free of charge (20 bands in total) and easy to understand instructions. Warnings: The bands contained within this kit are made of rubber and are not suitable for anyone with a rubber allergy. This kit is not intended for use on any other skin conditions such as, warts or moles. In all cases please consult a doctor before use. This product is not suitable for children.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-your-tags-will-fall-off-in-a-few-days">Great product! Your tags will fall off in a few days!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After spending weeks (unsuccessfully) trying to remove a large skin tag with Tea Tree Oil, Apple cider vinegar etc. I was about to give up and head out to the doctor&rsquo;s office. In a last desperate attempt to remove the tag myself, I looked up this product and I&rsquo;m so happy I gave these TagBands a shot! It took about 7 days for the skin tag to &ldquo;die&rdquo; and then all i had to do was to use a small nail clipper and remove the dead skin. Super easy! I will say though that the skin tag will swell and hurt a bit the first few days, but trust me, suffer through it and leave the band on because the tag will fall off eventually! I recommend that you clean the tag with hot water (or Hydrogen peroxide) twice a day to avoid infection. I should also add that my skin tag was located in a very embarrassing, private area - so these literally really work on ANY part of your body. Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="i-actually-had-an-anal-skin-tag-that-i-used">I actually had an anal skin tag that I used &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually had an anal skin tag that I used this on. And although it was a little uncomfortable it really did work!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It took from 5-12 days for my skin tags to fall off (and I &lsquo;helped&rsquo; several of them). One tag got either irritated or infected &amp; I had to get my daughter to cut it off after about 6 days. It ended up drying up &amp; falling off anyway. Although I considered any of my tags to be large, the base of the tag was quite narrow &amp; the micro kit would be necessary for those. I had tried apple cider vinegar &amp; tea tree oil previously &amp; had no luck. This works and I will order the micro kit for the smaller ones but will wait a while, as I was very much ready for these annoying bands to come off!</p>

<h5 id="this-works-really-well-i-was-skeptical-at-first">This works really well. I was skeptical at first &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works really well. I was skeptical at first but went ahead and ordered it. I had a skin tag growing on my inner thigh for probably around 8 years or so. This worked well to get it off. It was a large tag. It took about 10 days to get the entire thing off. I also had one on my back that I had to get help with applying the bands. After those fell off I got the other ones on myself. It worked but was a little difficult keeping the bands on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-device-is-very-easy-to-use">The device is very easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product is exactly what it appears to be. It is basically tiny Rubber Bands with a device to put the Rubber Bands around the skin tag. The device is very easy to use.My two main concerns for the product are the sterility of the method used and also the price.The are around my skin tag appeared to have gotten a little infected. For this reason, I would personally recommend seeing a dermatologist before using this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-1">It works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After years of thinking I had to see a dr to have my 3 skin tags removed, I thought id try this product because it was a LOT cheaper and seemed less invasive than having them cut off.This works!!! I had one on my neck, the back of my knee, and my armpit area. All three are now gone!The band did fall off the one on the back of my knee a couple of times because of moving that part of my body a lot, so I put a small bandaid on it and that fixed the problem.This does take TIME. At least 4-5 days before you see a result, and after it falls off, it takes a week or so to heal. But it does work exactly like it says!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-2">It Works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Something that actually works. I am still in awe, thinking how can I invest in this company? The product works exactly as promised. It doesn&rsquo;t get much better than that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="is-there-a-skin-tag-fairy">Is there a skin tag fairy?!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there a skin tag fairy?! Cause mine just fell off! This product works exactly as described. My tag fell off in 5 days. A lot of reviews do mention concerns about infection. This was a concern for me as well because my tag was in a dark, warm, humid area. To combat that, I put betadine on sterile gauze pads and applied that to the tag twice a day. The betadine also seemed to help the tag to dry up quickly. I now have a small wound where the tag was with a 50% cream colored, 10% red, and 40% pink granulated wound bed that&rsquo;s about half a centimeter in diameter. I&rsquo;m conflicted about which product I&rsquo;ll place on the wound bed, because ideally a wound heals best in a moist environment, but I don&rsquo;t think that will be a problem given the location of where this tag was. I&rsquo;m going to try to continue to use the betadine twice a day, and if the wound worsens I&rsquo;ll switch to something else such as Neosporin.Very important note! Anyone who is allergic to betadine, iodine, or shellfish should not use betadine.</p>
