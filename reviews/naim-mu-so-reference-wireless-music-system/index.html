<h5 id="and-what-i-got-was-an-education-on-how-good-powered-all-in-one-units-could-be">&hellip; and what I got was an education on how good powered all in one units could be</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I expected excellence and what I got was an education on how good powered all in one units could be. This will be an ongoing review as I have only had the unit for a few days but suffice to say it is the best $1500 I have ever spent&hellip;.so far. But I must quell my excitement and give a balanced review including what went wrong or less than stellar. This is my first Naim product and I was warned by another reviewer that it would be the gateway drug to their equipment, most of which is far more expensive. I should have listened but it&rsquo;s too late to turn back now&hellip;more to come.FEB 25th: Garbage in, garbage out. If you think this will turn a cruddy mp3 and etc into perfectly golden ear candy then keep dreaming. The more you upscale and I mean USB jitter correctional units as well, the more you&rsquo;ll enjoy. I&rsquo;ve heard the unit sound coldish and I&rsquo;ve heard it sound like a million bucks. All dependent on my source material and what presented it. Rejoice in that. It&rsquo;s an adventure.Feb 27th: How you position the unit will have a lot of effect on how it sounds. Ear level-Off Ear Level all sound different. Experiment. Closer to walls mean more bass, of course. Had a special night of watching the snow fall as I sat at my windows and the Muso was so captivating in its quality that I felt some sort of transformation within, not just enjoying the music but evolving in a pleasurable way. Delicate strings and thunderous bass&mdash;this thing sounds like its creator worships MUSIC not frequency responses&mdash;that&rsquo;s for sure. Had quite a few out of bodies while lost in the sound earlier in the day. Basically the Muso is a drug. Listening to it while writing this and I&rsquo;m glad to be alive. I am trying to stay away from flowery language and be objective but it&rsquo;s difficult to do because the pleasure won&rsquo;t stop.(Oh developing a &lsquo;cobra-like dancing neck&rsquo; sometimes when the complex rhythms do their thing. Happens automatically INTO it. Thank you, Naim.)Put on the iconic soundtrack &lsquo;Finding Nemo&rsquo; and now I have a newfound respect for Thomas Newman. The tapestry of moving colors that was revealed! My widening eyes while being caught up into the musical wind only to be sat down gingerly in a swinging arc. It was like coming in for a graceful landing! Ludicrous! I am ashamed I haven&rsquo;t felt this way before! Keep in mind I&rsquo;m listening to the TIDAL music streaming service WITHOUT ANY TONE CONTROLS WHATSOEVER&mdash;which can&rsquo;t be happening. I&rsquo;ve always been an EQ man my entire life. I still am&hellip;but the Muso can live happily Flat. How I loathe the connotation of that word in audio &ndash;FLAT. It should be called NATURAL instead. Sigh..ok enough poetics for today. I feel conned. Surely this child-like joy is the result of some sort of trickery? I need a nap.(More to come&hellip;.but it&rsquo;s starting to feel pedantic to go on&hellip;)March 1st:Put 9 serious hours on the M and I can hear it breaking in&mdash;becoming more refined. More clarity meaning more &lsquo;out of the black background&rsquo; emergence&hellip;a saxophone burnished out of nowhere today, slithering satin brass down the side of my face and my eyebrows reached for my hairline. Bass is taking on more texture with the impact becoming more localized vs. disembodied. I&rsquo;ll probably buy another M to keep as a back up. That&rsquo;s not hyperbole either. The M is part of my life now and I will call 911 with a code ADAM if it goes missing. Windows within the music are starting to open meaning if I allow myself to follow this instrument or that then the entire song is enjoyed from a slightly different perspective&mdash;meaning you hear the song AS the bassists then AS the pianists then as the singer&mdash; It&rsquo;s something we did as children quite naturally.Thought I heard a rattle from the speaker&ndash;it turned out to be a synthesizer from a song I had heard dozens of times before but never to this degree of detail. The Break IN phase is happening. Geez.*Tried the FLASH DRIVE MODE feature with WAV files burned from CDs in ITUNES (Meaning you put music files on a FLASH DRIVE and play them from the USB port) You can control the track changes via the WHEEL OF SEX atop but not even the track number is displayed so you have to use the NAIM app to see where you&rsquo;re going. The app screen layout is sparse so you get the name and number of the track and that&rsquo;s it. I would have liked more features such as a RANDOM button. Also of note: If using a wireless device to control the track changes make sure it&rsquo;s set to NOT fall asleep or else it will take the music into the arms of Morpheus with it.FLASH DRIVE MODE shows you what the Naim is capable of without all of one&rsquo;s ancillaries to change the sound quality. It was simply beautiful and dynamic, so you don&rsquo;t need a laptop or wires to play true CD quality music. The DAC handled WAV files burned from CDs with ITUNES perfectly. Again NO tone controls and it sounded fantastic NOT thin or lacking in bass or treble or midrange. (OH&hellip;perhaps I lie here&hellip;within the NAIM app I did have the loudness ON and the wall placement option was set to further than 25cm from the nearest sheetrock meaning it would give more bass to compensate.) Did I just confess to being a BASSHEAD??</p>

<h5 id="audiophile-in-a-box">Audiophile In A Box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound is wonderful for its size. Unlike impressive noise from a small enclosure this has a quality sound from a small enclosure. I have owned complete Naim systems in the past and have never been disappointed. It may not seem like it but the price is very low considering it is a Naim product. This is a true audiophile component.</p>

<h5 id="customer-for-life">Customer for life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Customer for life! Have always known Naim equipment was premium. Never had the money for what I really want&hellip;who does lol. If you enjoy music and don&rsquo;t have a lot to spend this is the way to go. This product will give you a new appreciation for your music and it is entry level audiophile. That being said&hellip;a new world awaits for music lovers who want to experience music the way it was designed. There is a lot of engineering into music and it only holds that the equipment that replays the recordings should also be highly engineered to match. Naim is one of those highly engineered products! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enter the world of true reproduction without breaking the whole bank. I have my sights on the supernait from Naim and then most likely individual components to get the full musical experience I am after. Good luck and good hunting&hellip;you could never go wrong with Naim products</p>

<h5 id="mu-so-wireless-speaker">Mu-So Wireless Speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this as an Airplay device, playing music files through iTunes and to play audio from the TV. I own several other wireless, Airplay/Bluetooth speakers, and enjoy them all; but the Mu-So takes the experience to another level. It&rsquo;s not an audiophile system costing several thousand dollars, but it excels at what it&rsquo;s designed to do. Visually, the design is aesthetically pleasing, and the DAC (digital audio converter) is top notch. Love it!!</p>

<h5 id="all-that-and-so-much-more">All that and so much more.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super impressive and modern right out of the box. It did take a bit just to figure the thing out. Great things take time, I guess. This unit replaces the sonos / play 1&rsquo;s / sub &amp; connect which sounded amazing for that ten minutes a month when it decided to function. No issues at all with this streamlined piece of art that happens to sound great.</p>

<p>Clear sound. Great functionality and versatility.</p>

<h5 id="everything-i-play-on-it-is-amazing-right-out-of-the-box">Everything I play on it is AMAZING right out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin. I saw this in an article and was curious. I want to hear the music as its intended. I started with Sony, Sennheiser, and Bose. I own products from each, but NAIM is a whole different realm. I mean the sound! Everything I play on it is AMAZING right out of the box! From what I&rsquo;ve been told the system has a break in period so I can&rsquo;t wait to hear what my music sounds like after that. I&rsquo;ve played Rock, Rap, Hip-Hop, Country, Gospel, Classical, Jazz, Contemporary Jazz, and R&amp;B. They all sound sublime! I also didn&rsquo;t realize that I could connect it to my TV and all I can say is WOW! If you have the money, buy this system!</p>

<p>I have spent thousands on Amazon and this is my first review. The Naim Muso makes me happy. I&rsquo;ll be purchasing another along with an xb for my other rooms in my urban lair. Thank you Naim!</p>

<h5 id="lives-up-to-my-expectations">Lives up to my expectations</h5>

<p>Sounds great. Have mine in a family room and the depth of sound fills the space. The best wireless I&rsquo;ve heard. I&rsquo;m sure there are others out there just as nice.</p>

<h5 id="astonishing">Astonishing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Truly astonished. I can&rsquo;t believe this is an all-in-one. It definitely sounds as good or better than separates you&rsquo;d spend $1,500 on.</p>

<p>I have listened to the Mu-So and the Devialet side-by-side. The bass is simply not comparable. Save your money and buy the Devialet Phantom.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-okay">It&rsquo;s okay&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Highs were high&hellip;clear as a bell. LOWs on the other hand where a bit flat. Bass was shallow and confined to the area where the unit was placed.</p>
