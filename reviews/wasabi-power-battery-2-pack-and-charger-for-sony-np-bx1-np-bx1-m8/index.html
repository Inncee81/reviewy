<h5 id="much-lower-capacity-than-claimed">Much lower capacity than claimed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much lower capacity than the original batteries, which is quite disappointing as they don&rsquo;t just claim to match the original batteries, but claim to be 30% more capacity. The first giveaway is that the battery weighs less:Sony OEM NP-BX1: 24.6gWasabi 1st battery: 20.9gWasabi 2nd battery: 20.6gI have a battery tester that will measure the capacity of batteries (first you fully charge the battery, then connect it to the tester, and it runs them down and measures how much output they give before dropping below a set voltage, I discharged the batteries at 1A, with cutoff voltage set at 3.0V. Setting a lower discharge rate or lower cutoff voltage would allow to squeeze a bit more power out of the batteries, but take much longer. As long as I used the same settings on all batteries, they can be compared directly against each other)Sony OEM NP-BX1: 1180 mAh (95% of rated 1240mAh)Wasabi 1st battery: 840 mAh (53% of rated 1600mAh)Wasaby 2nd battery: 835 mAh (52% of rated 1600mAh)So even though these batteries claim to be 30% bigger than the original batteries, they are actually 30% smaller! There should be a law against this sort of thing but unfortunately almost every 3rd party battery supplier lies about their capacity from what I&rsquo;ve seen. In terms of price per capacity, these are still a way better deal than the original batteries (2 batteries and a charger for $18 vs one battery for $30), but just be aware they wont last as long so you will need to carry more of them around.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-rechargeable-battery-and-charger-i-recommend">Very good rechargeable battery and charger, I recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have two camera I use on a daily basis. I like to shoot in RAW which uses up a lot of battery very fast. I also do quite a bit of cold weather shooting which also chews up battery power very fast.I did a search online and the reviews for the Wasabi Power Batter and Charger were almost 100% power. I placed my order and stated using them as soon as they arrived. They have stood up to months of daily use without a single problem.The charger seems to finish faster than the other chargers I have which cost almost twice as much as these. The batteries also seem to last longer than the other rechargeable batteries I have.I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for a rechargeable battery and charger.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-brand-batteries-and-rechargers-maybe-so-and-at-a-fraction-of-the-price">Better than the &ldquo;Brand&rdquo; Batteries and Rechargers? Maybe So, and At a Fraction of the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are very good quality &ldquo;off-label&rdquo;/OEM batteries. I&rsquo;ve owned and used Wasabi batteries for a number of cameras now, both DSLR and also point and shoot. They have not disappointed me yet. In fact, I struggle to find much operational difference between them and the brand batteries (and that includes Sony, Canon, and Fujifim versions). And then, to boot, they are very inexpensive, and come with a charger, and an adapter, too! So, they are quite a bargain. They wouldn&rsquo;t be if they did not work well, but I&rsquo;ve been very happy with them thus far, and, to be honest, the battery charger they supply is better than either the Sony or Fuji variants because it is lighter than both, and because it uses the flip-style plug, instead of the ridiculous, heavy cable (Fuji, are you listening?) that makes the brand rechargers a pain when you are traveling. I can&rsquo;t help recommend them more highly. Easy five stars, but I&rsquo;ll have to say &ldquo;Six Stars&rdquo; due to price and operational factors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adapter-broke-but-otherwise-good">Adapter broke, but otherwise good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the power pack to go with my Sony cybershot, and the batteries work great! The charger has an indicator light (red, orange, green) to show how charged the battery is. One battery lasted me two days in Europe, turning the camera on and off between shots. My only problem was the European adapter, which broke after only a month of use. I guess it didn&rsquo;t like being jostled in a bag. I had a better quality adapter with, so that didn&rsquo;t cause any problems as far as I was concerned, but I recommend others buy another converter just in case. It is always nice to have extra batteries, though, especially when traveling. I could plug them in overnight, and have three fresh batteries, which would last almost a week. However, when one died, I&rsquo;d charge it, so I almost always had two charged batteries and one in the camera. It meant I never missed a shot because my camera died. Absolutely wonderful!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-on-my-vacation">Worked great on my vacation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great on my vacation.. The adapter was very helpful and worked well since i was in France. On the tour, i was constantly taking pictures every 5-10 minuets. However, i have to constantly power on/off when not using. My Sony RX100 uses a lot of power during startup/shutdown. You definitely need 2 batteries while on vacation. Only thing was when it goes down to 3 bars of power, it can quickly go to 4 and then get power exhausted fr camera and is dead. Battery level not that accurate so need to carry spare. Also, this charger will not work with the battery that came with the camera. The batteries that come with this charger is a little thinner than the Sony battery. Would buy this again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-package-for-my-new-sony-cybershot-camera">Excellent Package For My New Sony Cybershot Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased a Sony DSC-RX1R and was surprised that an external charger was not included with the camera. Canon includes an external charger with my 5D3 so I expected this accessory would be included. No biggie. Wasabi to the rescue.This kit is fantastic. The batteries work great so far, and offer at least equal run time as the battery included with the RX1R. The charger is relatively quick. I love the fact that they included the automotive power plug for charging on the go. Extra batteries and an external charger are essential with the RX1R, especially if the shooter is using the camera for video or extensive still shooting.I have to question the negative reviews about these batteries, I have had no problem with them at all so far. If I did have an issue I would immediately contact either Amazon or Wasabi for a warranty exchange rather than slam the batteries with a bad rating. Any electronic device can suffer a manufacturing defect. Give them a chance to make it right.</p>
