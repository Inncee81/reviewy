<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-for-maxiumum-adustments">Perfect for maxiumum adustments.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered one for the living room as we needed the TV to come out about 20 inches to match the built in shelves. Liked it so much, ordered another one for the bedroom where we need to to be flat to watch from the bed, and to rotate out 45 degrees so the gradkids can watch from the couch in the bedroom. It does cause the TV to sit out about 5 inches to compensate for the swivel arms, but since we want it to swivel and we will be putting in shelves in the bedroom requiring the TV to come out 12 inches, this isn&rsquo;t a problem for us. If you don&rsquo;t want it to swivel and want it flatter to the wall, this isn&rsquo;t the mount for you. It also comes with all the mounting hardware for most situations (lag bolts, block expansion anchors, those spring loaded T mounts), plus all the hardware to connect to your TV. Has a built in bubble level, and adjustments on the plate that the TV sits on to rotate it, ensuring a perfect level. Also rotates facing up and down. Works great.</p>

<h5 id="really-great-mount-and-excellent-value-read-why-only-4stars">Really great mount and excellent value - Read why only 4stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So after having it for about a month, finally installed the television. I would give it 5 stars but it had some shortcomings that some might agree with.SETUP:Samsung 55&rdquo; 8000 seriesMounted in basement above fireplaceTop row screwed into horizontal studBottom row screwed into drywallPROS:* First, for what it&rsquo;s worth it weighs a metric ton. Okay, maybe about 45lbs of which is mostly the arms. I&rsquo;m not concerned about a mechanical failure resulting in my &lsquo;baby&rsquo; getting dropped onto the fireplace mantle* The installation package is possibly the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It literally has every possible screw/bolt/nut/washer you could need. I would say the installation package is what you would expect from a $200+ kit.* TV installation and mounting was super easy: install brackets on back of TV and hang it on the plate with the circle cut-outs, tighten bottom screws to lock in place&hellip; done.* Built in level on the back ensures an even install* Price: just an excellent value for what you getCONS:* Weight: I know it&rsquo;s also in the pros but the weight of this makes it almost a 2-person installation. I did it myself, but I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; and pretty strong.* Flexibility in installation: I had a horizontal stud which makes it VERY secure along the top but this left me with basically NO flexibility in the height. I would have liked it about an inch higher but didn&rsquo;t have a choice. Now if it&rsquo;s moved it kind of scrapes against the fireplace mantle which the wife is NOT happy about. This is why a star was subtracted. If you have vertical studs, it would be a 5 star product.* Ease of Movement: I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just how it is out of the box but some of the joints are very difficult to move. With the multiple joints it&rsquo;s hard to move but nearly impossible to get it back flat against the wall.OVERALL: I would suggest this product based on the construction and value. Again, if there was any vertical play it would have gotten 5 stars, but still a great product.</p>

<h5 id="too-few-hardware-adapters">Too few hardware adapters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount came with very limited hardware for the actual TV, but I assumed that the manufacturer would provide the screws that would fit my 2016 Samsung 43 inch TV because every TV wall mount I have ever purchased came with a generous variety of screws to adapt to most popular brand TVs. However, this wall mount had very little mounting hardware to choose from and nothing fit my TV.Luckily I found the extra screws from my last wall mount purchase (different manufacturer) in a marked baggie in my garage and behold! The bag contained the screws that I needed.For this reason, I will not recommend this product to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strike-2">Strike 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second mount that I&rsquo;ve tried with my 50&rdquo; Panasonic plasma and the second time that it&rsquo;s sagged so bad that I&rsquo;ll be returning it. My first mount was the similar Cheetah Mount (Cheetah Mounts Plasma LCD Flat Screen TV Articulating Full Motion Dual Arm Wall Mount Bracket For 32-65&rdquo; Displays Up To 165LBS With 10&rsquo; High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet Fits Up To 24&rdquo; Studs). When I hung it I was surprised at how far the TV sagged. When I contacted the manufacturer they said that this was a known problem with recent shipments and I should return it to Amazon. They also went as far as to say they were recalling them from the resellers (not an official recall though). Back it went and I ordered the one from Mount-it!. Not only does it have the same problem, it is the same mount. The ONLY difference being where the TV attaches to the two vertical supports. The rest of the articulating mount is IDENTICAL to the Cheetah mount. Now that I&rsquo;m looking for it I see others such as the one from VideoSecu that use the same mount as well.I am sharing some pictures to show the sag which seems to come from both the links and the TV side plate. The later plate twists significantly between where it is suspended in the middle to where it supports the TV at the ends.</p>

<h5 id="best-wall-mount-ever">Best wall mount ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As the headline says, &ldquo;Best wall mount ever&rdquo;.I have now purchased 3 of these for me and 2 more for people who have visited my house and wanted one.For those of you who have used traditional mounts and struggle to access the back for plugging in HDMI or other cables, this is MUCH better. With this mount, you can pull the TV all the way out, do all of your cable connection and management, then slide it back up against the wall.It also lends itself to rotating easily, so if you wish to rotate the TV up to about 45 degrees, this works perfectly.As far as sturdiness, even full extended, this holds the TV well (I currently have 1 55&rdquo; and two 65&rdquo; TV mounted on these).The last feature is really cool too - you can actually rotate this vertically as well to make final adjustments to ensure it is level. Even with the most careful measurements and leveling attempts, the TV can be off just a few degrees from level, so being able to make that final adjustment is really handy.I highly recommend this wall mount.</p>
