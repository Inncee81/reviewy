<h5 id="this-is-a-great-first-telescoe">This is a great first telescoe!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This telescope is great for an amatuer astronomer. It is a great first telescope. I purchased it to help get my son into astronomy and now I am hooked. We have seen Jupiter w/4 of its moons, the rings of Saturn, Mars, the Moon, the Orion nebula and more. I love the challenge of finding objects in the sky. I didn&rsquo;t think I would like the red dot viewfinder, but I was wrong, it works great and is simple to use. While this telescope may not be the best, it has allowed us to see things we have never seen and it has really gotten us into astronomy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-entry-to-space">A great entry to space</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am really enjoying this telescope. I was able to see Saturn, Jupiter with 3 moons and a gorgeous full moon craters big as can be. I did buy an accessory pack including 3 additional lenses and moon and planet filters which have enhanced this nicely. I would recommend this to the casual star gazer, I love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-kids-just-getting-started">Great for kids just getting started</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids love the sky especially the stars. This is a great telescope to get them started in astronomy. They love setting it up outside and seeing what they can find. The adjustable height makes it great for all the kids. The telescope brings everything especially the moon in very good. My daughter was able to see mars the first night she used it.</p>

<h5 id="quality-at-a-good-price">QUALITY AT A GOOD PRICE!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The Gskyer refractor 90mm x600mm telescope came professionally packaged and the instructions were very simple because they were mostly pictures. I assembled this in roughly 20 minutes with the help of my four and five-year-old, LOL. It could&rsquo;ve probably been done in 10 minutes or less if they weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;helping&rdquo;!The Alt-azimuth Mount was already on the tripod when unpackaged. The only thing I had to do was slide the telescope tube, which was already attached to the D mount clamp, onto the tripod and tighten down the screw. Next I inserted the view finding scope which was a alittle tricky because it has a retaining ring around the tube. Just make sure that the retaining screws are backed all the way out and you hold the spring-loaded pin down while you&rsquo;re twisting the scope in until the black meets the white. Next, the only thing else I did was placed the tray on the tripod and put the diagonal mirror into the telescope tube. Now you&rsquo;re ready for viewing by throwing in the 25 mm eye piece, removing the lens cap, and adjusting your focus.When you&rsquo;re viewing terrestrial objects or space/Celestial objects&ndash;make sure that the tripod is on the ground. That means concrete or earth/dirt. Don&rsquo;t put it on your deck because any little movement will make the scope vibrate. Put your 25 mm lens into the scope and place it on an object that is about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> mile out. Then adjust your finding scope so what your viewing through the eyepiece is in the crosshairs of the finding scope. Get well versed with your telescope looking at terrestrial objects before you look into the nights sky. The reason that I say that is because you need to know everything about your telescope before you put yourself into a dark environment and not being able to see your telescope. Turning on the light every few minutes to see the telescope will mess up your night vision and diminish your fun and enjoyment of viewing the night sky.In conclusion, this is a very well-made scope that is solid and robust. It is metal throughout and only has a few plastic pieces. Alt-azimuth mount is smooth and secures well with the pan/tilt handle. The eyepieces are of good quality and make a good starting set for your telescope. I was able to see the craters of the moon like they were 2 feet from me, I was able to see the red bands of Jupiter with no problem and I was also able to see Saturn&rsquo;s rings. This is a good intermediate scope that encompasses terrestrial and Celestial viewing with ease. It has a lot of highend options that other cheap scopes do not have, i.e., camera securing screw ins, piggyback mounts, and threaded camera screw in attachment. I was in astronomy club when I was in middle school/high school and have friends that are astronomy nuts, &ndash;I have used high quality scopes and eyepieces and this telescope is right up there with a $400 telescope. This is easily transportable and very durable scope that will last for many, many, many years! It is very easy to use and even my five-year-old was able to figure it out and was amazed at the moon was so close.I really didn&rsquo;t have any cons with this telescope for the price except for maybe that an equatorial mount would&rsquo;ve been nice to keep in sync with the earths rotation.I received this product for free/ nicely discounted price in exchange for a fair and unbiased review. I am a registered nurse and my word/trust is my reputation! Any negative ratings will be posted here.</p>

<h5 id="great-telescope">Great telescope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first telescope and I tried out mounting my NIKON D3300 to it. For a new person this thing is pretty straight forward and easy to use. Good overall zoom, great detail of the Moon, I was blown away. Came with several accessories, even a 3x Barlow lens, which is really nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a gift and it looked good to me when set up. The recipient replaced the tripod provided with a sturdier model but said he liked the telescope itself very much. A great price I thought for something which is likely to give a lot of pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-scope-for-the-price">Good scope for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Light weight but well built. It came neatly packed and the setup, with the included instructions, was fairly easy. The instructions do not mention all the thumbscrews that you have to loosen or tighten to use the unit or change the lenses. For terrestrial viewing, this is a very powerful device. The included stand is quite solid and the adjust controls for positioning the telescope work well and have a fairly wide range of movement. The red dot aiming device is very helpful and reasonably accurate, I made no adjustments to the aiming device but I see that it can be tweaked. Much of the stand and controls are lightweight materials and strong plastic. I doubt it would survive a fall down a flight of stairs. The tube of the scope is shorter than others I have seen but for moon and solar system objects did well. We&rsquo;ve already seen the moon so close that we can easily make out smaller craters and other features. Jupiter was viewable and so were a four of it&rsquo;s moons. But just looked like a big spot and four smaller ones. I have not played with the included software yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="saw-jupiter-and-it-s-moon-for-the-first-time-in-my-life">Saw jupiter and it&rsquo;s moon for the first time in my life.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The instruction manual for setting this up could use cleaning up. The images which correspond to the steps provided are randomly placed creating some unnecessary confusion. The instruction themselves are easy to follow and understand. This was my very first telescope and something I have been meaning to get for a very long time. Once I had it set up, I managed to point it to Jupiter which was the first thing to appear. Seeing it&rsquo;s spherical shape along with it&rsquo;s four moons for the first time in my life was quite an experience. This telescope is really quite impressive for it&rsquo;s price and is definitely a great buy as a first telescope</p>

<p>This telescope is excellent and works fine according to our needs. Thanks for all</p>

<p>This is a really nice telescope for a novice person. I would consider this a perfect item for someone who is interested in astronomy.</p>

<p>Works great, grandkids love to use!</p>

<p>I found and observed Jupiter and the Galilean moons on my first attempt with this telescope. It was my first attempt with any telescope at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great telescope for looking at the moon (which is the main reason I got it) but it also has a 3X Barlow lens that lets you see pretty far.</p>
