<h5 id="product-works-but-images-are-very-misleading">Product works, but images are very misleading&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received 3 of these and I can say the product images are very misleading. There are not led light indicators for the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys as shown in the images. Also the battery compartment is very difficult to access&hellip; I was afraid the first few times that the battery compartment slide would break, that&rsquo;s how much force I had to use. Not all the function keys seem to work, but a good number do work. Overall I&rsquo;m a little disappointed as one of the main reasons I purchased these over other wireless KBs was the led light indicators for Caps Lock and Num Lock.In their defense it does mention &ldquo;actual products may vary from images shown&rdquo;, however in my book it&rsquo;s still false advertising. Please fix the images in the description to match that of the actual product.</p>

<h5 id="hp-k3500-wireless-keyboard">HP K3500 Wireless Keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this keyboard for a couple of months now and am very pleased with both its space saving design and performance. Typing is smooth, with no lagging and no skips or inadvertant repeats, and although the sound is audible, it is not annoying or destracting. Build quality is sturdy, but light weight and compact. I use mine as a desktop keyboard, but it works equally well with my mini laptop, when I want a full size keyboard with numeric pad. I use this keyboard with a Microsoft Sculpt Mobile Mouse, and the combination for me is close to ideal. The only real shortcomings are no battery indicator light and no caps lock light: in fact, there are no lights at all, which I am sure contributes to the extra long battery life, but can lead to some confusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="greatest-keyboard">Greatest keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little keyboard if you don&rsquo;t use a mouse. I am sure there are some people out there who are not mouse users, or have one in particular that they like. In that case, this is the perfect keyboard (only) for you. It is laid out in the standard key lay out, the keys are very quiet, and it is just a nice keyboard all around. I am a blind person, and cannot see the mouse cursor, so naturally, this was the perfect choice for me. I have a mouse from an older keyboard/mouse combo that I bought for the occasional sighted user that I have on my computer, so that works out fine. Other wise the mouse stays stowed away in a drawer. I recommend this keyboard to anyone, hp will register it for you, and they support it well, as they do with all of their products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far, so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good keyboard feel, like the short travel chiclet style keys.Very similar to the Dell 636 model that I had previously purchased on Amazon but had to send back because some of the keys stopped functioningafter a few weeks.Would have preferred to have num and caps lock led&rsquo;s, but at this price point that is hard to find.Only thing that is a neg for me right now is that the space bar is a bit louder than I would like but I can live with it.I like the oversize delete key which is getting harder to find in keyboard config&rsquo;s nowadays.This is a very good value keyboard assuming of course it continues to function. Only had it for a few hoursso time will tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="caps-lock-light-doesn-t-work">CAPS LOCK LIGHT doesn&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the HP keyboards because they are not bluky. But the HP and Amazon websites just cannot seem to get a correct description. I went to my local blue and yellow electronics store to look at this K3500 model to see for myself that it has a caps lock light, and it did. But local store didn&rsquo;t have any in stock so I ordered this through Amazon, and even though there is a tiny LED light on the CAPS LOCK key, it DOES NOT illuminate. I tried updating the driver, looking for settings solutions and even just reasoning with it, but no dice. What kind of crazy manufacturer puts a LED light indicator in the key, but doesn&rsquo;t connect it to anything! Also, the battery compartment is extremely difficult to open; I was certain it was going to break when trying to pry it open.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-only-disappointment-is-the-fact-that-the-lights-do-not-function">My only disappointment is the fact that the lights do not function &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this with the HP Z3700 mouse in black, just to give my computer a slightly more sleek and updated look, plus my old logitech was finally just about dead. First the upside: it connects very quickly and the buttons are very smooth with not a lot of clacking when you type, so it is relatively quiet. My only disappointment is the fact that the lights do not function on the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys, and (I know it&rsquo;s silly) the logo is the little hp in the circle in the top left corner, not Hewlett-Packard spelled out along the top center. I know my gripes are a little silly, but I&rsquo;m very visually oriented, and I liked the appeal of the logo and the fact that there were indicator lights in the images for the product. HOWEVER, these things in no way detract from the usability of the product and how well it is made, so I&rsquo;m still giving it 5 stars and I would highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-wireless-keyboard-come-with-usb-receiver">Decent wireless keyboard come with USB receiver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent wireless keyboard come with USB receiver. Very light weight, looks really good keyboard. When I type on this keyboard is quite smooth and responsive. The noise when I type is not that noisy. The color matches with my laptop which what I will use it with. Compatible with windows 8, I haven&rsquo;t got any issue with it. This doesn&rsquo;t come with the on/off button so I guess it turns off by itself after computer turns off</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hp-wireless-keyboard">HP Wireless Keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To set up this keyboard, plug in the connector piece to a USB port on your computer, Flip the keyboard over and press the blue &lsquo;connect&rsquo; button until a small orange light flashes on the upper right corner of the keyboard. It did not always flash when I pressed the blue button but of course the real test of how it works is by how (or if) it types. Mine typed when it was properly connected and the typing is smooth and quieter than other keyboards, less clunky and click-y. There is still a definite click sound but it is more muted. The keys have a more firm feel and are lower to the keyboard, not sticking out so much like some keyboards. The wireless feature is great, gives the whole keyboard a minimalistic style.</p>

<h5 id="sleep-mode">Sleep mode</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the keyboard but it constantly goes into sleep mode while I&rsquo;m typing. I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a way to fix this?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-junk">Cheap junk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t pair every time my computer wakes from sleep. Odd delete home key configuration.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="favorite-keyboard-ever">Favorite keyboard ever.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of ordering another one of these to replace my keyboard at work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-it-and-it-works-well">Like It and It Works Well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly, I use it with the laptop connected to my tv so the keyboard is ten feet away from the computer. Keys have a good feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fine-for-some-but-not-for-me">Fine for some but not for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not crazy about this. It&rsquo;s just my personal preference but the action is a little weird. The keys are set too close to the base and they don&rsquo;t really push down the way I&rsquo;m used&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-similar-to-hp-kt-1087-plastic-and-cheap-meh">NOT similar to HP KT-1087. Plastic and cheap, meh&hellip;</h5>
