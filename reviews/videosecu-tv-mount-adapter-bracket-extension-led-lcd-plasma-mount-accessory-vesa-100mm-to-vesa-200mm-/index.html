This set includes 4 adapters; which convert VESA 100X100 to 200x100 or 200x200mm. It has been tested to hold heavy weight. However the actual loading capacity is limited by the wall mount.

<h5 id="solved-my-problem">Solved my problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solved my mounting problems for a 27&rdquo; LG monitor who&rsquo;s screw mounts were 100x200. The plate that came with the mounting arm ran into some problems because the holes were too small initially. I debated going to a hardware store and getting the right size, but having a dremel tool on hand I just bored out the holes slightly to make the screws that came with it fit cleanly through the enlarged holes. Took me about 10 minutes all told and only because I was being a bit overly cautious. Once that was done, figuring out how to orient the 4 arms involved a little trial and error as what seemed like the better fit turned out not to be due to the molding on the back of my monitor. But once I had that figured out, it went quick and smooth, the extender arms secured the backplate to the monitor snugly and solved my problem for a lot less than many competitors were asking for.Now that said, there are differences in the screws that you should be mindful of, if you did like I did and read Plutarch&rsquo;s top spot review in full, you&rsquo;ll have everything you need to know before these brackets show up in your mailbox and minimize any frustrations in the process.</p>

<h5 id="disappointing-won-t-work-with-samsung-monitors">disappointing - won&rsquo;t work with samsung monitors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disappointing. I have tried to use this with two Samsung monitors, and it won&rsquo;t work. First - the samsung (275t and 2494) have a recessed 200x100 vesa area. If your monitor or TV has a recessed area, this setup is not likely to work. Second, the holes for the screws are very large. No small screws will work - the screw heads will slip through. You would have to add washers or use a large thumb style screw. Third, the bar extends past a 200x100 VESA type setup.So - in short - flush mount only, supplied screws are unsat.</p>

<h5 id="several-mounting-styles-and-strong">several mounting styles, and strong</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When the package arrived, smaller than a pack of cigarettes, I was worried I&rsquo;d bought a pig in a poke.Nope, these little straps are sturdy, packaged with exactly the right nuts and bolts, and configurable to a few orientations to make sure you can get your screen mounted.My use case: I wanted to mount my Vizio m43 monitor, 43&rdquo;, to a stand designed for smaller monitors. The stand was rated to 32 pounds, pretty normal for a 32&rdquo; monitor a few years ago. The Vizio m43-C1 is only 22.5 pounds, so it&rsquo;s plenty strong to hold the device.the vizio has a standard 200mm X 200mm mounting hole pattern. Note that neither this adapter kit nor the TV itself came with the M6 screws I needed to mount into those holes, but the local hardware store provided those for $2.the little &lsquo;bend&rsquo; in each of these straps makes it easy to position them correctly, either lying flush with the mount or adding some headspace if necessary.My monitor is mounted in a workspace and I regularly grab its corners and rotate or tilt it. This adapter has held firm through all the moving around. If your monitor isn&rsquo;t moving it will certainly stay firm with no adjustment for a long time</p>

<h5 id="works-get-washers-and-correct-screws-from-the-hardware-store-fot-the-monitor-tv">Works, get washers and correct screws from the hardware store fot the monitor/tv</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works, be sure to get washers and correct screws from the hardware store for the monitor or tv side as this item only includes screws and lock nuts for extending the mount. Used to extend 100 x 100 to 100 x 200 vesa arm.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="working-great-holding-up-a-42-led">Working great holding up a 42&rdquo; LED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Already had a wall mount from previous home owners and did not need a new one since my 42&rdquo; LED is light enough. The mount was capable of 100x100 or 200x100, but with these adapters was able to mount my TV with 200x200. As noted by other reviewers, this comes with 4 brackets and 8 M5 bolts and nuts; you will need to go to your local hardware store (ACE, Home Depot, Lowes, etc&hellip;) and buy screw to mount the TV if you do not have them. Most likely you will need four M6 bolts. Also make sure to check your TV mounting bolt depth (15, 20, 30, 35mm) as your TV may have recessed bolt holes. I had to buy at least 30mm M6 bolts (M6x30mm), but each TV may vary.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>does what it says it will do - converted my vesa 100x100 to 200x200definitely a nice thing in a small package; you get exactly what&rsquo;s picturedthe only bad thing was that i had to scrounge up 4 new bolts for my new 32&rdquo; Vizio (fortunately i had a set on hand)so make sure you have a set for your new TV on hand when you go to hang it using this adapter!this is one of the better bargains out there&hellip; believe it or not, i asked for a wall mount when i got my TV at the Wallyness of World, and was told, &lsquo;Nope. Don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;em. Haven&rsquo;t had any in stock for four months.&rsquo; - boy howdy, was i surprised!so amazon to the rescue - again!</p>

<h5 id="great-adapter-but-you-may-need-your-own-screws-bolts">Great adapter but you may need your own screws/bolts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to use with a monitor stand that was VESA 100x100 that I wanted to use to mount a 40&rdquo; TV with VESA 200x200 holes. It more or less works perfectly - it&rsquo;s definitely sturdy enough, and easy to assemble. For the money, it&rsquo;s a great adapter.The only con is that it doesn&rsquo;t include VESA 200x200 size bolts, so you will need to use your own (I had to go buy some). Also, the bolts for the 100x100 side of the adapter are not very long, and you may need to use your own (longer) bolts, as I did.But for the money, the need to acquire/use some of your own bolts isn&rsquo;t a big deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-adapter-for-vesa-75-100-mm-mounts">Great adapter for VESA <sup>75</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> MM mounts.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They seem very sturdy and they don&rsquo;t block any of the inputs on most tv&rsquo;s unlike large plates can. The double bolts worked perfectly with my VESA 75-100 MM mounting hole already. Nice alternatvie to installing an entirely new mount. My 40&rdquo; id only 17 LBs and my smallish mount seems to work just fine. Screws and nuts are top notch. Just be sure you buy the proper bolts for your TV (generally M4 to M6).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="check-mounting-bold-size">Check mounting bold size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The item would work for my television except the bolt size is 4M and I need 6M screws. Which would not be a problem since I could go to the hardware store and get the screws.</p>
