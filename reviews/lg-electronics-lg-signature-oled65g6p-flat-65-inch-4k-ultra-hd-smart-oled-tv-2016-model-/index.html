<h5 id="finally-lg-has-made-an-uhd-oled-that-s-matured-into-a-capable-future-proofed-visually-stunning-tv">Finally, LG has made an UHD Oled that&rsquo;s matured into a capable, future proofed, visually stunning TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update 01/20/17- It is official, I finally purchased a 2016 Oled (65in E6)! As expected, completely gorgeous TV which excels at everything I throw at it. Few observations now as an owner: 1) I&rsquo;ve noticed no issues with blurays being up converted on this TV, and as a 3D fan, I am EXTREMELY happy with the turn out of 3D compared to my 2012 LG LED. There is an Auto setting with 3D on these models which I assume change settings scene by scene, eliminating some of the ghosting I had on my previous model. Avengers 2, Civil War, Jungle Book all look amazing in 3D on this TV. 2) I&rsquo;ve bought a few 4K HDR movies during black Friday and tried a few on my Xbox S. To be honest, I feel that most of the bluray versions of the 4k movies I bought look about the same, I have a hard time distinguishing between the two unless I pay close attention. Though not all 4k movies are HDR (and I will definitely not replace all my blurays to 4k), there are select 4k HDR movies that just seem perfect for OLEDs. For instance, movies such as Mad Max Fury Road and The Martian with a wide range of colors really stand out on this TV. I noticed on Mad Max the improved resolution with 4k, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I saw explosions and lightning (the dessert storm chase scene) that I was truly impressed with the TV&rsquo;s HDR capabilities. Basically, pick and choose your 4k HDR movies since not all really take advantage of the TV&rsquo;s abilities. 3) I had a hard time getting my Xbox to &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; my TV as HDR capable. I tried different HDMI cables, restarted the TV and Xbox, and was still not able to play 4k discs. I finally realized that you need to go into settings under General (not picture settings), and turn ON HDMI ULTRA HD DEEP COLOR for whichever HDMI ports have a 4k capable device connected. This solved my issue with playing 4k discs and getting my XBOX to recognize my TV as HDR. 4) The plastic brackets holding the TV to the stand break pretty easily. I can see a hard rocking motion or an earthquake cause the TV to break away from the stand. Not a problem since I mounted the TV but an observation to earthquaks proof your TV if possible. 5) I will be writing a review on the 2017 Oled models (which look fantastic), and though they do have improved HDR features, wider color gamut, and improved peak brightness, unlike 2015 to 2016 where 2016 signature Oleds were clearly superior, 2016 models are a great choice even after seeing the 2017 models.ORIGINAL REVIEWAs a big follower of OLED technology for several years now, I was almost 100% sure that I was going to buy the EF9500, which I almost did during the Holiday season of 2015. But like any electronic, the most important question to ask is &ldquo;will it worth it to just wait until next year?&rdquo;. This question kept me curious to wait until CES 2016 just to see if LG had anything really worthy up their sleeves. Turned out that LG did have something worthwhile to show to the electronic world with the new 2016 signature line of OLED TVs. Although nothing would make me happier than having a 65&rdquo; OLED of my own right now, patience for the right TV has kept me from making an $10,000 investment in Oled a few years ago when the technology was just taking baby steps. Patience is also what&rsquo;s going to get me a great deal on a 2016 Oled this holiday season. Along with the rest of the 2016 signature Oleds (G6, E6, B6, C6 all share the same video processor and specs), this Oled is THE TV you&rsquo;ve been waiting for, and if you were on the fence on just buying an older model for a steep discount, allow me to explain why I feel its worth the wait to buy a 2016 Oled instead.I have looked into specs for both the 2016 and the 2015 lineup, and it all boils down to one simple question. For the price (above $2,999), am I getting a TV that is future proof? When the EF9500 was released, no one can deny that it wasn&rsquo;t amazing to look at. Compared to the EG9600, it got rid of the curved screen, and it included all three HDMI 2.0a &amp; HDCP2.2 ports that would allow for UHD HDR content through HDMI (not just apps) which made me feel like it was future proofed at the time. Then the price dropped from $6,999 to $5,999, to $4,999, (I&rsquo;ve even seen the 65EG9600 for $3500 on Ebay as a daily deal) so I was tempted to buy and came close. So why should you wait to buy the EG instead? Simply put, the Oled technology in the EF9500 (also EG9600) will not be able to keep up with UHD players and UHD content hitting the market in the coming years in terms of ability, and in terms of the level of maturity in the OLED technology itself.To further elaborate on the subject, as another reviewer for the G6 2016 Oled did, as another reviewer did I&rsquo;d like to refer to a great article from tvevaluate.com with did have some great comparisons between the 2015 (EF9500,EG9600) and 2016 lineup (G6, E6, B6, C6) to help explain what the EF9500 can&rsquo;t do well. I also have added some information on HDR, HDMI 20a, and brightness comparisons that I found out through research as well.1) The 2016 Oled lineup features ColorPrime Pro technology allowing them to display 99% of the DCI-P3 expanded range of colors for better true to cinema visuals. The EF9500 and EG9600 models only cover less than 90% of DCI-P3 which affects their abilities to truly recreate cinema type visuals and colors. Blacks are still on par and similar on all models.2) The 2016 Signature models meet the criteria for “Ultra HD Premium” which requires at least a 540 nits peak brightness and less than 0.0005 nits black level. On the other hand on some calibration tests the EF9500 and EG9600 could be pushed to the upper 370 nit level range, but still not on par with the 2016 Lineup. Brightness levels may not come close to some 2015-2016 TV models from other reputable brands such as Sony and Samsung which can reach close to 1000 Nits or even more. However, LG&rsquo;s Oled&rsquo;s ability to decrease black levels in individual pixels to virtually off levels while displaying rich and vibrant color images creates enough of an image contrast to create superb HDR images and video. Athough HDR was added by a firmware upgrade on the EF9500 and EG9600 models, the increase in brightness in the 2016 signature lineup and wider DCI-P3 color range of 99% changes HDR and UHD video on an LG OLED from a Gimmick, to a industry competitor.3) Speaking of HDR and keeping up with future standards, one of the reasons I held out on OLEDs each year was the eventual introduction of HDMI 2.0a &amp; HDCP2.2. Originally, 4K content was possible with the older HDMI 1.4 but only at 24-30fps. HDMI 2.0 then came out and has become a standard on all 4K TV&rsquo;s which allowed 4k content to be played seamlessly at 50-60fps. Then out of nowhere, this thing called HDMI 2.0a and HDCP2.2 becomes a standard, and older (and still very decent) 4K TV&rsquo;s became outdated. What is HDMI 2.0a? It&rsquo;s the ability for UHD content to display content in HDR. HDCP2.2 is the copy prevention technology standard moving forward to prevent illegal copying of 4k content. If your TV doesn&rsquo;t have HDCP2.2 embedded into it&rsquo;s connection, (even if it had the ability to) your content will not play to its full potential. As stated before, through a firmware update the 2015 EG9600 was able to play HDR content but only through the third party applications like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, etc. The HDMI ports were all 2.0 and not HDCP 2.2 which meant future UHD players with the ability to play content in HDR would not work through HDMI. The EF9500 came out later in the year and actually included all three HDMI 2.0a/HDCP 2.2 ports. The 2016 Lineup includes a total of 4 (the rest of the 2016 OLEDs have 3) HDMI ports all of which are HDMI 2.0a and HDCP 2.2 compliant. The difference with the 2016 models is that they don&rsquo;t just display HDR, they execute it well. Simply having the HDMI port doesn&rsquo;t mean anything is the design and ability of the TV can&rsquo;t showcase the content however. This is where the G6 and all the other 2016 OLEDs impress. The combination of the 2016 Signature lineup&rsquo;s increased brightness and color range, creates a new level of vibrancy and authenticity to UHD video content. These improved capabilities have also made the 2016 signature lineup compliant with HDR (High Dynamic Range), HDR10 (2015 EF/EG are not compliant), and Dolby Vision formats (2015 EF/EG are not compliant). These are all important standards of UHD that Netflix, Amazon, and Movie Studios are incorporating into movies and TV shows that are available now, and in the future. Gizmondo wrote a great article on the comparison and extremely improved visuals of Netflix&rsquo;s Daredevil with HDR (Dolby Vision to be exact) on a 2016 Oled when compared to the 4k TV he already had, which just means I&rsquo;m going to rewatch both seasons when I do get the TV :-)Between the comparison of 2015 and the 2016 lineup, and keeping in mind the progress made in the last few years to elevate 4K content and UHD content, I realized that a shift was made in the entertainment industry from not only focusing on acquiring a higher resolution (4K), but to display video content to near flawless levels. The goal being to bring you elevated visuals straight from the imagination of movie makers, directors, etc. in a manner that balances fluidity, contrast, and color. This is where HDR comes in. And why is HDR so important? Because HDR is like a composer that pushes every visual component of your TV to play gorgeous and fluid visuals. It brings out light where it needs it, pushes black where it should be, and coordinates the color spectrum in an image with an end result that can be described as &ldquo;balanced, natural, and life-like&rdquo;. The future of TV is not just about the higher resolution, but about what&rsquo;s behind that resolution. The downfall with the EF9500 (and the EG9600 for that matter) is that what it visually displays, it does it well, but where it matters in regards to UHD HDR, HDR10, and Dolby Vision, &ldquo;well&rdquo; won&rsquo;t cut it in the near future. With an improved color range/spectrum and brightness levels the G6 can really make UHD HDR content justice. For those still on the fence on whether or not to go 2016, I suggest finding an in store display 65G6 from one of the available locations on LG&rsquo;s website (I went to a Best Buy in Los Angeles) and see the comparison for yourself. To me, there was NOTICEABLE difference in color and brightness when compared to the 2015 models, and if the content is HDR capable the distinctions were even larger.So what in particular is different with the G6 compared to the other models? Well as the top tiered Signature Model, the G6 includes an extra HDMI Port, an extra card slim TV remote (all models have the Magic Remote Control), and includes the a Harmon 4.2 channel, 60 W speaker soundbar that doubles as a wall mount if need be, a smart trick by the LG design team. For comparison the rest of the lineup include a 2.s channel sound system at 40W. Just like the E6 model, the G6 also has a distinguishable screen setup called &ldquo;screen on glass&rdquo; which places the oled screen on a glass backing only a few credit cards deep. This gives the Oled TV a much cleaner, classy, and unique look in addition to the gorgeous display. The lower end C6 and B6 models will have more of a 2015 EG/EF screen setup. For the Price, the 65E6 ($6,999) is my choice between the 2016 Oled Lineup just because I already have a surround sound setup. But after seeing the G6 instores, the inclusion of the Harmon sounbar/wall mount does a good job at providing a better audio experience for those without a current surround sound setup. As last years holiday season showed, I expect that the price for the 65G6 should drop by at least $2,000 this holiday season, on par with the price drops of the 2015 models last year. The pictures taken are from the instore G6 65 in model from bestbuy, the E6 looks similar minus the soundbar, and you can see the screen on glass look I’m talking about.This year, LG was able to break the standard of what a home OLED TV can really do. I am choosing the 65E6 OLED TV for my household because for the price, you&rsquo;re not just paying for a TV that looks good, you want a TV that hits a homerun for everything. Because in that case, there are plenty of television larger than 65&rdquo; and cheaper than $3,000 that can make current Bluray HD content look &ldquo;good to great&rdquo;. But unlike the transition from DVD to Bluray, Bluray to UHD standards now go above simply reaching a desired resolution and are now focusing on how that content is being visually displayed. Every 4K television before 2015 attempted a guess at what the future of TV would hold, but very few were future-proofed for what is yet to come in the next five years. So take it from someone who has been price checking and following Oleds for years, the 2016 LG OLED lineup successfully achieves the perfect balance between, OLED maturity, technological ability, and price that I and many others have long been waiting for. So if the price hasn&rsquo;t stopped you and you want the very best, look no further than the 2016 OLED lineup.UPDATE 04/13/16- I have recently come across a CNET article which goes over HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR more in depth, and I want to share some information for those on the fence of buying a new TV of any brand in the next coming months. When the signature line was announced, LG stated that their 2016 Oled Signature line was both HDR10 and Dolby Vision capable, this I thought had more to do with capability rather than actual hardware. As the CNET article explained, VIZIO and LG are the only major TV brands at this time to support both HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR on their newer TV&rsquo;s (Vizio will add HDR10 through a firmware update). HOWEVER, Samsung and Sony have pledged support for only HDR10. Unlike HDR10 which can be downloaded through a firmware update, Dolby Vision is only capable in TV&rsquo;s that have their Dolby Vision Chip imbedded inside the processor of the TV. Which means that is your TV isn&rsquo;t Dolby Vision capable from the beginning, it won&rsquo;t ever be. At this time, all 4k HDR Blurays are HDR10 and all UHD 4K Players are also HDR10, with neither supporting Dolby Vision at this time. However, most of the Dolby Vision content is coming from online streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and Vudu to name a few. As the CNET article also explains, Dolby Vision and HDR10 act differently on how the video content will be displayed in HDR, with some studios, directors, and producers showing a preference for Dolby Vision for some content, and HDR10 for other content. From what Netflix and Amazon have explained, shows that are HDR capable may be available in either HDR format which means that your TV or the streaming service will choose whichever HDR format looks best on your TV, or whichever they are only capable of. If a show was made in Dolby Vision and not in HDR 10 however, you&rsquo;re out of luck if its not an LG or Vizio. From what the Article explained HDR10 is open format which means more user friendly, but the HDR settings are static and don&rsquo;t change throughout the Movie/TV show whereas Dolby Vision might take some more time to work with, but it has the ability to adjust HDR from frame to frame which sounds great. Dolby Vision is also heavily backed by Google if that means something. Either way, HDR10 and Dolby Vision are just becoming known by most people, but it&rsquo;s important for those on the fence for either an LG, Vizio, Samsung, Sony, or other to understand what their TV is, or isn&rsquo;t actually capable of before buying.</p>

<p>The OLED picture is simply outstanding and breathtaking. The color is as good as a movie theater. Have hooked it up to a theater sound system to round out the &ldquo;total experience&rdquo;.The instructions are for the 65 and the 75 inch. The set-up is different for each - do make sure you don&rsquo;t follow one set-up when you have the other as the back side connections to glass face are different. There is optional wall-mount fixture available. The unit ships as a table-top configuration. Shipping and delivery is labeled as &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo;. Enhanced is described as delivery by appointment, two person in-home set-up and unit starting check-off (not full theater-system connections) and crate removal. With our delivery, the unit was air-freighted from Phoenix to Hawthorne California. Then trucked to our place by Pilot. We received an e-mail from Pilot asking what calendar day we wanted delivery (NO APPOINTMENT TIME-CHOICE) certain days were grayed in as available. Confirmation was for a Tuesday from 0900 to 2000 Hrs. Hawthorne is several hours away. We waited until 1458 Hrs for delivery. Rented truck arrived with one driver. He had a drop-gate but hoisted the box over the tail-gate without use of drop-gate. We told him we were not ready for in-house set-up. The TV was double-boxed with unusual tri-corner shock material. Driver removed the outer boxing and shock material. He wheeled unit just inside our front door, we signed and he departed. After a few days, we removed our old dying DLP large-screen, installed the new LG 65 4K and completed connections. Do remember to use gloves when installing as the oil from you hands will effect the glass screen.There is a firmware update, haven&rsquo;t had the time to install that. Go to their web-site for the firmware. I will be checking on this but I have seen a quick white flash on occasion - this might be my imagination or from the original video source or even a static discharge. This is NOT a major problem.Lots of money for the unit but if you enjoy a truly &ldquo;Non LED Blue-light&rdquo; picture, buy LG OLED!</p>

<p>After LG service never attempted to give me a new replacement, I called Amazon, told them what I went through and they asked when I want the new one, that is the way you treat your customers, I sent a letter regarding my problems to LG Corporation USA and LG Korea.So if you have problems just call amazon, they were great.I gave four stars, as LG service giving me a refurbished panel sucked.When I first turned on the TV I noticed fine horizontal lines, these seem to get worse, called LG customer service, who directed me to LG VIP customer service, LG Tech came out and told me the panel (TV screen) needed to be replaced, after replacing the panel the picture was noticeably better, however, when I was cleaning the finger prints off the panel I noticed marks on the bottom and fine scratches towards the top, the original panel was pristine, I was told this was a new panel, however, it was either not well handled or used.The next day I put in a 3D movie which I had played fine on the the original panel but would not play correctly on the replacement panel, even tried the test 3D image in setting, and that didn&rsquo;t pop out like it should, so I called LG customer service again, in short I told them LG should stand by there product and send me a new tv, this is there new flagship OLED signature series, customer service told me he would make a few calls, and the tech will come out again.With the money you pay for this tv and the problems I have had, LG should stand by there product and send me a new replacement tv.I will update this review after seeing what they plan to do for there customer, I would like to think they would send a new tv.</p>
