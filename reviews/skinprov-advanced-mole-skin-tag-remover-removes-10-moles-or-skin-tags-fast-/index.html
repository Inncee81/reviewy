<h5 id="ultimately-it-worked-cheaper-alternative-than-surgically-removing">Ultimately it worked. Cheaper alternative than surgically removing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If this review was solely based on customer service Skinprov would get a 5-star rating. I ordered Skinprov and used on skin tags I had on my neck but at first, it didn&rsquo;t work. I reached out to Skinprov and they gave me more thorough instructions. Unfortunately, I used almost the whole rather small bottle of Skinprov. I told them this and they offered to send me a new tube for free. So I took them up on the offer and ultimately Skinprov worked. But since it can be a bit tricky to use if not used correctly and because there is so little in a bottle (even though a little goes a long way) I am giving it a four-star rating.Here are the steps I took to make this product work for me. Hope it helps someoneStep 1. Use an emery board on skin tag / mole. I used a Revlon emery board that comes in a bundle pack from Wal-Mart, not the one that came with the product. You need to scratch your skin tag/mole until it is red and very tender. The longer the better. This will allow the product to better penetrate your skin tag/ mole.Step 2. Put Vaseline on the skin around the skin tag or mole. This will make sure that the product doesn&rsquo;t burn this area. I didn&rsquo;t do this the first time and the area around the skin tag became red and scabby. Ultimately it healed but it was not the most pleasant.Step 3. Shake and rub the bottle to mix it up a bit. You want a thick consistency. If it is runny I would close the tube and try and shake it up a little more.Step 4. Place the Skinprov on the skin tag or mole. I would recommend using a Q-Tip and cover the skin tag very well especially around the base.Step 5. Place a band-aid over the skin tag.It should sting a little if it doesn&rsquo;t, you may want to put more on or go back to step 1.Step 6. Go to bed and in the morning a scab should have formed over the skin tag. The skin tag should now be dead. In a few days, it should fall off. If possible I would keep a band-aid and Neosporin on it. Mine took 3-5 days to fall off completely. I also used vitamin E oil and Neosporin after my skin tag fell off to prevent scarring.If this doesn&rsquo;t work I would try again and rub your skin tag with the emery board even more. On larger skin tags it may take a couple tries. If it does not work. Reach on to Skinprov. Their customer service responded right away and was very helpful.</p>

<h5 id="it-work">It work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff works. But it&rsquo;s not an over night fix. Expect it to take at least two days to remove the mole and another few days for it to heal.</p>

<h5 id="5-star-product-just-be-sure-to-read-the-instructions-thoroughly">5 Star Product, Just Be Sure To Read The Instructions Thoroughly!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a great product. I highly encourage you to read the instructions thoroughly though. I applied it twice after skimming the instruction pamphlet and didn&rsquo;t see any results. After rereading the instructions, I concluded I wasn&rsquo;t scratching the mole enough. So, before the third application, I used the included emory board and scratched around the entire mole until it felt a little tender. After that I applied Skinprov, put a band aid on and went to bed. When I woke up I peeled the bandaid off and to my surprise the mole had flattened and turned into a scab. From there the scab took about a week to heal and the mole was gone! I would recommend this to everyone, just be sure to scratch the mole or skin tag well enough to allow Skinprov to really get into the skin.</p>

<p>Worked exactly as described !!! 5 full size skin tags off in less than a week with plenty left over..</p>

<h5 id="works-great-definitely-recommend-to-anyone-really-works">Works great, definitely recommend to anyone! REALLY WORKS!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great, and removed my moles that I have had for my whole life. It is so relieving to finally be rid of them once and for all. I highly recommend this product because it definitely helped remove my moles painlessly and also within two weeks. I have removed 4 moles with this product, and they were even kind enough to send me a free tube when I said it wasn&rsquo;t properly filled. Great customer service. I am currently waiting on a mole on my back to fall off, but it has already hardened into a scab within 24 hours, so it&rsquo;s amazing! This product deserves more traction than it is getting. I feel it&rsquo;s a great product that does what it says it will do. I spent 39.95 for the Advanced formula and was not disappointed. I have always been embarrassed of my moles and now I feel I can be proud of my body again.This product is easy to apply, just make sure you rub the mole or poke it to open the pores and the Skinprov should soak into it and a light stinging sensation should follow. Then wait 30-40 minutes, remove, and your mole should be soft. It will harden over the next 24 hours, and slowly it will start to die. I am so happy this product works, and if you are unsure about it, I&rsquo;d say go for it. It&rsquo;s a lot cheaper than going to a doctor to remove it when it&rsquo;s non-cancerous and it&rsquo;s completely safe.</p>

<h5 id="worked-for-me">Worked for me! 😜</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a small raised mole on my neck about two inches below my right ear. I followed the directions exactly. WARNING! &ldquo;File the mole ever so gently. You do not want it to start bleeding.&rdquo; My advice: Don&rsquo;t file the mole at all. Wash with soapy wash cloth in the shower and rinse with hot water for about ten minutes.I covered the mole with the Skinprov useing my fingertip then let it sit and dry for about 15-20 minutes. Yes it will sting a little bit! That&rsquo;s normal. Don&rsquo;t be a baby 😢Then back to the shower for a good rinse. Gently pat dry.Now the wait game. By the next day a scab formed and in my case it looked a lot worse before it looked better. &ldquo;I was feeling a little skeptical&rdquo; By day five or six the scab had fallen off leaving a small light red bump. By day twelve I could see no evidence of ever even having a mole😜😁Note: During the healing process, do not touch or pick at the scab! Rinse it well in the shower daily! Do not rub dry with towel. PAT DRY! You do not want this to start bleeding!I am very happy! This stuff works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Went in very skeptical &amp; nervous.Took the chance and applied it to 3 moles at once on face. Did scab over and was worried the scabs were not going to ever fall off (even though it said it would take a week or more) and was beginning to question why i did 3 at once. :) They did fall off within 7 days. It has been almost a month and I do still have red marks but they are slowly fading, but I rather have that than the moles! Would recommend! Planning on using it for a couple more moles! Couldn&rsquo;t get my before &amp; after pics to come in clear so I didn&rsquo;t post them. But this stuff works!</p>

<h5 id="garbage-that-doesn-t-work">Garbage that doesn&rsquo;t work!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A waste of $37! It does NOT work at all! Very disappointed, this did nothing at all</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product works great. After trying multiple &ldquo;home remedies,&ldquo;Compound W Freeze Off, and Tag Band, none of which worked, this product didthe trick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="1-2-the-size-of-what-the-details-says"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the size of what the details says!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is only 0.17 oz. The detail page says it is 0.3oz, so the actual product is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the size of what it is supposed to be!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-really-works">It really works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SkinProv is amazing! It worked for me in about 10 days. You can&rsquo;t even see where the skin tag was, it&rsquo;s gone! I had a really ugly skin tag on my inner thigh that I just hated!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works">Works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. Did not expect it to work this well. Just follow the instructions and the mole will come off. My two moles came off in 4 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-truly-does-work">IT TRULY DOES WORK!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I have to tell you that I didn’t think this stuff was working. I applied it three weeks ago and for two weeks, there really wasn’t anything going on - a tiny little scab&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised</h5>

<p>I had a skin tag about 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches below my eye (lower eye socket) and it was beginning to get annoying&hellip;</p>

<p>The product is very easy to apply. Preparing the mole before application is the most important. I left mine on overnight, it had made a scab, but after about 3 weeks I still had&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="not-as-advertised">Not as Advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t do anything for my skin tags. I have been to the doctor to have them removed after purchasing this product. It didn&rsquo;t change mine at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-good">It works good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still healing but most of the mole was removed in a few treatments. It&rsquo;s absolsutely worth a try compared to spending hundreds of dollars at a skin doctor&rsquo;s clinic.</p>
