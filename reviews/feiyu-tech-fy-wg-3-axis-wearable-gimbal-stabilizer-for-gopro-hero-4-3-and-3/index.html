<h5 id="little-help-for-those-who-has-a-dead-unit">Little help for those who has a &lsquo;dead&rsquo; unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mine actually arrived and it worked right away. Well, at least AFTER the camera has mounted on it, and some troubles that I almost going to send it back.!!!WARNING!!!DO NOT start the unit WITHOUT the camera on it!DO NOT play around the panning axis by making it to turn multiple round!!!The above warning has no where mention in the user manual as extreme caution, and I believe that happened to quite some users especially couple units that I saw posted on YouTube seeking for help to resolve their problem.Doing so for what I warned for, actually pull the connector wire which is inside the panning axis which render your unit - dead. Whenever you turn on the unit, it will try calibrating, making a spin on the turn axis, and then stop - like a near dead fish making its very last stroke then, dead. You turn off and turn on again it does the same time - like you tried reviving it with your deepest soul&rsquo;s prayer. Nah.I was packing and about to return and saw the L-key that matches the screws of the unit. I thought about it and open up - sure enough, there the connector pulled out with the wife curled up inside the tiny chamber. You will need very very, fine, skillful hands to put it back. I was kidding. It was just not that hard.I attached some pictures here so you could see what I mean.1. Before removing the cover make sure batteries are removed.2. Unscrew the panning axis screws (3) on the side, and slowly pull it out by holding the GoPro bracket.3. See the 2nd picture for the closeup. When you pull it out if the white connector is already disconnected, you found the problem. The male connector should reconnect to the female. You will need 2 tiny tools to help push the connector back in as the chamber is small.3. Match up the 3 pin (black) when closing the unit.4. Put back the screws and batteries.5. IMPORTANT: mount the GoPro!!!!6. Start the unit (press and hold for 2 seconds) (did I hear some HOORAY already?)I hope it helps to some who are broken hearted. Help is on the way!Performance: the unit works pretty well except that I do not like the horizontal turn axis (turning left and right), not sure what this is called. When I was expecting the unit to make a smoother turn it would randomly make a sharp one. I have updated to the latest version but it seems no improvement. Perhaps I am using it with a selfie stick/GoPro stick so turning movement is a lot more than using it with a chest mount/helmet mount/bike mount, which you only need to face it to the same directions without making sharp turn of the angle.All in all a nice gimbal for a first time user like me! I wish I will get some time and would like to take some footage to show you guys. Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="nice-gimbal">Nice gimbal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice gimbal for my gopro hero4. Compensates for high frequency vibrations very well. Makes videos a lot smoother than without it. As for neg side, Just like any other gimbal, when you do fast turns and corners, the pan motion will be delayed and not look natural. Doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of features like osmo, karma grip etc, but it just does what a gimbal is for so is good enough for me. Keep a lookout, if it runs out of battery&hellip; all the arms/axis goes loose and free motion so don&rsquo;t leave it hanging around after it runs out of juice, store it in your bag else it will slam around. But anyway, battery seems to last 3-4hrs as advertised so good enough for a usual moutain bike ride and i&rsquo;d be carrying spare bat anyway. Other than that, it is a nice gimbal, does its job.</p>

<p>Hey Amazon people!Just showing you guys some footage from a GOPRO Hero 4 Silver, using the Feiyu Tech FY-WG 3-Axis Wearable Gimbal. Also I admit this is not some of my best riding, but I was so eager to test it out that I just tried it the next morning and these are the results. It does what it suppose to do, its a wonderful little device. However it could use some upgrades, the only thing that holds the GOPRO are 2 very some what small and thin screws and the one screw where the batteries go. Its not water proof as well. To sum it all up, if your tired of shooting really shaky video, buy this. I also read a lot of reviews saying that they wouldnt dare use the Gimbal in fast or shaky activities and I disagree, it holds up well. Just dont crash hard with it, easier said than done right? lol Happy riding or whatever the hell sport you do :) Thank you for watching![&hellip;]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At first it goes well and everything seems perfect, but after about 2 days it started to work very strange. When it is turned on it is rotated to a very strange direction, and keeps in that way afterwards no matter what you do. Sometimes it even has some funny noises inside. I have tried many ways trying to fix this problem but it hasn&rsquo;t been resolved yet, very disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="just-okay">Just okay</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this product because it makes my videos crispy smooth however the shape of it makes it awkward to mount. I understand you can orient it and adapt to whatever the object you are mounting it to but the bulkiness of it makes it interesting to work with. I find it works better when you mount it onto something that has a stable base for the gimbal to lay on compared to it being free floating.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-product-if-a-little-immature-on-the-software-side">Fantastic product if a little immature on the software side.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This miniaturized 3 axis gimble from Feiyu Tech is a marvelous piece of kit but it&rsquo;s not perfect. Mine arrived and was leaning quite heavily to the left, with a quick search I realized I needed to update the Firmware and this is where my problems began. Upgrading the firmware on this is not for the faint hearted, you must read the instructions numerous times before embarking and even then the software to do so is immature and certainly not intuitive. I bricked my Gimble after accidentally clicking the wrong button. Feiyu customer services are very friendly and tried their best to help me resolve the problem before giving up and asking me to send the unit back to China. The cost to return is quite high but Feiyu didn&rsquo;t charge me anything to fix the problem or to return the unit. Now my Gimble is working fabulously and I am very happy. It&rsquo;s a fragile unit and I certainly won&rsquo;t be attempting to update the firmware anytime soon but as long as you are somewhat tech savvy and patient I would recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="cheapo-car-dash-cam-works-better-than-this">Cheapo car dash cam works better than this&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thought it was car vibration making the gimbal tilt, but just used it for a sunset capture on a stable surface where no outside influence could impact it. It leans to the left every time no matter what. Spend the extra money on a product that actually works*Old Post*Mounted to car dash but vibration of car made camera tilt to side, and gimbal couldnt cancel out all the vibrations. Cheapo car dash cam was better quality. Gonna mount on backpack shoulder strap in a month for a hiking trip and will see if results are better during walk/run. Will update response in a month with results.</p>
