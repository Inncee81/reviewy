<h5 id="durable-a-simple-solution-to-a-persistent-problem-of-mildew">Durable, a simple solution to a persistent problem of mildew</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through a couple of insulated lunch bags, as one does with small kids, but this one is particularly great. Yes, I&rsquo;m a dad and yes I pack the lunches and yes I love Totoro. So should you. But what&rsquo;s really great is that the bag is just simple neoprene. Other bags have more complicated construction with different materials, lots of seams and areas where mildew develops (we live in the tropics so good insulation and mildew are constant issues here). And once mildew starts, it&rsquo;s often hard to get rid of. And some bags just don&rsquo;t handle being put through the washer very well. Neoprene is a very tough materials, it can easily handle runs through the wash when it gets dirty, and so far no problems with mildew since March. Of course, it&rsquo;s black inside already so I&rsquo;m not sure I would even be able to SEE mildew. But really I&rsquo;m not concerned, this is what wetsuits are made from and they are quite hardy. It also insulates quite well, comparable to more traditional insulated bags. The shape is a little awkward as it&rsquo;s not a rectangle, so some things may not be able to fit that you would otherwise be able to fit in similarly sized but square container. But overall we like the simple design and the durability of it. And Totoro.</p>

<h5 id="shipping-from-china-very-cute-and-perfect-size">Shipping from China. Very Cute and Perfect Size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received my order. It is just as I expected &ndash;brightly colored and large enough to fit a lunch box. See photo&ndash; it can fit a 5.2 cup Rubbermaid Red top container with some extra room for two cans of soda or a bottle of soda on top. It is cute. But buyers please take note that this will be shipping from China. I did not see that in the product details when I ordered on Jan 30. I live in New Jersey and I was afraid it won&rsquo;t arrive on time for a Feb 8 birthday present. But it arrived today Feb 8. So if you order just be aware of that fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-graphics-and-easy-to-clean">Great graphics and easy to clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The lunch bag is neoprene or something like that which makes it soft and pliable as well as light. The top zipper&rsquo;s shut which works well for my daughter who sometimes likes to swing her bags around so nothing falls out. The bag keeps things cold with a cold pack throughout the day until we get home after school and work. What I loved most was that when my daughter squished blueberries from her lunch all over the interior of the bag, I just put it in the laundry and hung it to dry. The easy clean up and having one of her favorite characters on it makes this a super bag that I hope we can use for years to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-and-durable">Cute and durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this for a while to take my lunch to work, and I love it. It&rsquo;s really cute and durable, and it keeps my drink cold on the way (I do have a fridge at work so I&rsquo;m not sure the maximum length it will keep things cold). It did have a little bit of a chemical smell but not too bad and one trip in the washer did away with it. I get lots of compliments on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-that-s-why-you-re-going-to-buy-it-and-you-won-t-be-disappointed">So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re going to buy it and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made, durable. It&rsquo;s not huge. You could fit a 20oz soda and a sandwitch in there. It&rsquo;s not going to zip if you put a sandwitch size Tupperware in there. The color is vivid and the zipper is durable. It&rsquo;s got Totoro&hellip; So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re going to buy it and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="i-bought-this-for-my-daughter-who-loves-totoro">I bought this for my daughter, who loves Totoro &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my daughter, who loves Totoro, and it is really cute. It fits her lunch, her snack and something to drink.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-that-when-a-yogurt-spontaneously-combusts-inside">I love that when a yogurt spontaneously combusts inside</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Two of my boys (9 and 11) are very hard on their lunchboxes but so far, these have stood up well. The boys are thrilled with the designs, they hold their shape well even stuffed with a full meal, they insulate well (at least from the time they get on the bus till lunchtime at school), they fold flat when they&rsquo;re empty, and so far, they can take whatever abuse little boys can dish out. I love that when a yogurt spontaneously combusts inside, all we have to do is rinse and all is well in the morning (unlike the Walmart lunchbags that were a layer of nylon, a layer of foam, and a layer of poly that never came/stayed clean). I&rsquo;ll be ordering these lunchbags for the other kids (and me!) when replacements are due!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adorable-and-hilarious">Adorable and hilarious</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Adorable and hilarious. Bought it because this is what I look like when I don&rsquo;t get fed. Athletes don&rsquo;t like to starve &ndash; they get Hangry (anger caused by hunger). As with other neoprene products, it has a chemical smell at first. Don&rsquo;t be a wuss &ndash; wash it. Like you should be doing with any fabric item before using it for the first time. The odor will be greatly reduced and any residual odor fades within a week. Like your hunger will fade when you use this bag, which insulates tasty vittles very well. Forget the doggy bag. Take the angry cat bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="10-10-would-buy-from-this-seller-again"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would buy from this seller again!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> the smell that people keep talking about literally went away after two uses. meant for small lunches. not recommended to store tupperware in. keeps food and drinks cold.</p>

<p>Too cute</p>
