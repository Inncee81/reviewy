<h5 id="it-just-works-have-patience">It just works - have patience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As other reviewers have stated, this does work but it takes some time. I applied it to a shingle roof that was almost black with mold/fungus that was a result of being under a tree and partially shaded. I only bought 1 gallon which makes 6 sprayable gallons when mixed with water. I applied it in June and had my doubts since there was no immediate gratification, however over the next few months it was startling how it changed. See picture taken in October. (taken from a quadcopter in case you are curious) Since I bought only 1 gallon I didn&rsquo;t have enough to do the whole (roughly 1800 sq ft) roof and wasn&rsquo;t going to buy more until I was sure it would work. You can see where I sprayed. It does need to be exposed to rain to be cleaned off over time as the product directions state otherwise you&rsquo;ll need to brush/spray it off after a few days. The product description is a bit misleading with regards to the hazards. If you peel back the label or go to the manufacturer web site you&rsquo;ll see the specific hazards. It is a corrosive, so don&rsquo;t spray it when the wind will blow it back in your eyes or on your skin. Don&rsquo;t let pets on it unless it is dry. I have used Jomax with bleach and it did not clean my roof like this product has.</p>

<h5 id="great-results-on-concreat">Great results on concreat !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Started using it last year and this year I see the results. OUTSTANDING! This year I bought more.Does what it says. SLOW to react, but well worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-roof-mold">Great for Roof Mold</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this last year and used it on one house of mine in the late Fall. Went up on the roof with a sprayer and sprayed the roof. By this Spring the mold was all gone. Between the snow and rain it worked gently and cleaned the roof. What went down the gutters did no damage to my lawn or rain barrel water. I just bought this container for a second home with the same issue. I sprayed it on it last month so we&rsquo;ll see what Spring brings but I am sure it will work. This second home does not have gutters so this will wash onto some brick steps with the same mold problem. I am hoping it cleans those also.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-did-not-spray-a-small-section-so-i-could-better-determine-the-results">I did not spray a small section so I could better determine the results</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have grey asphalt shingles on my roof with the black discoloration that comes from mold over many years. I followed the directions and mixed with water. I applied this onto the roof shingles with a garden sprayer in late August in Raleigh, NC. I did not spray a small section so I could better determine the results. One month later I questioned whether the W&amp;F stuff was working at all. Even two months later with probably eight rains I still questioned it. However, now it&rsquo;s been four months and I must say this stuff works well in removing the black discoloration on asphalt shingles. My asphalt shingles were probably a 7 on the scale of one to ten in how bad they were (ten being the worst). This stuff probably removed about 75% of the discoloration. I&rsquo;m going to apply a second application of this W&amp;F stuff again in the Spring. My conclusion is this stuff definitely works. It might take three or four months, but it works.Update Feb 22nd, 2016: After the second application, it&rsquo;s probably been six maybe eight months, not sure. My roof (asphalt shingles) looks incredible. I had also sprayed portions of my driveway about five months ago. Those sections that were sprayed look MUCH better than the sections not sprayed. I&rsquo;m ordering two more gallons today to spray my entire cement drive. I&rsquo;m upping this from four stars to five stars.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-a-metal-shingle-roof-that-had-mold-and">I have a metal shingle roof that had mold and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a metal shingle roof that had mold and moss growing on it because we have large oak trees. I sprayed the bottom 5 rows of shingles and the next day they already started to look cleaner, by the next week you can visibly notice a difference. I ordered more to finish the roof and do my sidewalks.</p>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised-took-a-little-additional-scrubbing">Works as advertised. Took a little additional scrubbing, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised. Took a little additional scrubbing, but it removed all the mold spots from my Vinyl House Siding and Aluminum Rain Gutters. To my pleasant surprise, I noticed the side of the House I treated last summer did not have the mold return this Spring :-) !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-may-be-disappointed-i-ve-been-using-it-for-a-couple-of">you may be disappointed. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a couple of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff works for me, but you have to give it a lot of time. I spray it on my asphalt shingles to stop the mold/mildew stains that tend to build up on the more shady sides of the roof. I also get some moss on the shingle edges at certain locations. I apply it as directed with a garden sprayer. After a few months, the stains go away and any moss dries up and dies. If you&rsquo;re looking for something to happen after a few days or even weeks, you may be disappointed. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a couple of years, and I think I&rsquo;ll plan on a yearly retreatment. It&rsquo;s way easier and cheaper than using a roof cleaning service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works really good on vinyl siding mold and mildew. Applied as directed all traces of mold and mildew were gone within 6 weeks without pressure washing. Easy to apply and could see results within 48 hours, applied second coat at two weeks in heavy area per directions siding looks like new now.</p>
