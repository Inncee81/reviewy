<blockquote>
<p>Just my background - I run an eCommerce company and I have always been a laptop man. I haven&rsquo;t been able to get used to mobile operating systems with the programs I use. I tote around my 17&rdquo; laptop using a hotspot and when at my desk, I&rsquo;m always hooked up to external monitors. I just can&rsquo;t do intensive work with anything smaller. I&rsquo;ve used iPads a lot and they&rsquo;re fun but I can&rsquo;t work on them. I&rsquo;ve been eyeing a Surface Pro for years, but for $1500, some of the reviews just had me concerned. And I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d even like the tablet for work. But for meetings and sales calls, the laptop is just a bit too much, so I started hunting for something that might work. Here&rsquo;s my review - I hope it helps:First off, let&rsquo;s just give this 5 stars out the gate. I&rsquo;ll go into more detail but guys, this thing costs about $150 and runs full Windows 10! For the price, complaining about minor things would be silly. Bottom line - it does the job and exceeded any of my expectations. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. But just make sure you get the 32GB version.So for the most part, I just use this for web browsing, email (Thunderbird), eCommerce chat/customer service, Netflix streaming, etc. I haven&rsquo;t installed Office yet and it probably won&rsquo;t run Adobe products, but that&rsquo;s not what I bought it for. It does everything I need just fine. No complaints at all.Startup is very fast. Maintain your start up programs and don&rsquo;t bloat the device. Wake from sleep can be 4-5 seconds at times, but let it chug along and she&rsquo;ll be fine. Overall, I was impressed with the speed but obviously it&rsquo;s not lightning. I was pleasantly surprised with the overall performance. (Haven&rsquo;t frozen yet and I&rsquo;ve been using it 3 weeks.)The size is perfect. I like a larger screen, and this thing is slim. Screen is crystal clear, and is the touch responsiveness is right on.Of course, it has its quirks. These aren&rsquo;t complaints because again, this is $150. For example, sometimes Chrome won&rsquo;t let me switch tabs anymore. To resolve, I just hit the Chrome icon in the task bar and it seems to reactivate it. Takes half a second and problem solved.The screen will scratch very easily. Don&rsquo;t wipe it with your T-Shirt. Order a screen protector right away and you&rsquo;ll be fine, though I had to cut mine to fit with a razor. Problem solved.Camera is pretty low resolution but I wasn&rsquo;t buying this for the camera anyway. For Skype it will be fine. But I had to take a photo of my driver&rsquo;s license for banking purposes and it was too blurry for them. No worries&hellip;my phone works for that.I have yet to find a good case that will sit on your lap well. The Fusion5 case doesn&rsquo;t do the trick, but I won&rsquo;t ding the tablet for this.Battery life is pretty impressive. However, it does seem to take quite a long time to charge. Not really an issue for me and again, at this price point I&rsquo;m not complaining. As long as it doesn&rsquo;t catch on fire we&rsquo;re good here.I like Windows 10 a lot, but it has some things that aren&rsquo;t so great on a smaller screen. But that&rsquo;s Windows 10 - not this tablet. Like adjusting sliders on web pages for sorting by price and moving windows around. The sliding/dragging motion in particular takes some getting used to. I wish you could also zoom in on anything (not just a web browser.) Sometimes in some of my programs the icons are so small and my fat fingers hit everything at once. But again, not the fault of the tablet at all and I have always been able to make it work for me.I will say this - the first unit I received had been used. There were programs installed and web history. It was fulfilled by Amazon, so that is Amazon&rsquo;s fault when they processed a return. I got a replacement and that&rsquo;s all good. But, what I will say is that the replacement I received was not the exact same model as the first, though they both shipped from Amazon days apart. The first one was gray (vs black) and some of the plug-ins like headphone and power were swapped around. Startup screen was a bit different too. That said, performance seemed the same among them. Just something to mention.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. Best $150 I&rsquo;ve spent. I have considered purchasing these for our entire sales staff since they&rsquo;re so cheap, but want to give it a little more time before I do that. And hats off to the product developers/designers. It&rsquo;s great!PS. For those complaining about a manual&hellip;not sure why you really need one. Just turn it on and go. The startup manual does have some good information about how to charge it for battery optimization the first few times, and had other instructions too. And the seller is supportive through Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="false-advertising">FALSE ADVERTISING!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is advertised as being new, but it is not! I&rsquo;ve bought and returned this tablet twice, thinking the first time it came with the factory seal broken and the small box with the accessories left open, was a fluke. It was not! The 2nd one I bought came just like the first one. The factory seal was removed completely from the second one and the accessory box was also left open. The price was very attractive for a &lsquo;NEW&rsquo; tablet. DON&rsquo;T BE SWAYED BY THE PRICE. You&rsquo;re not getting what you think you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-portable-desktop">A portable desktop!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Such a lovely little tablet! My only problem was that the text is pretty tiny to hit the right place with touch screen, but that was solved by connecting my bluetooth mouse, which has a fine little pointer. I am using this for all the many things that don&rsquo;t work on a Mac, such as Quicken and Turbotax and my genealogy package. Handier to tote to the field than my old desktop, too! I haven&rsquo;t added storage via SD card yet, but am happy to know that option is there.</p>

<p>we bought the fusion5 for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it , he use it for work . The price point on this unit was excellent . The unit was loaded , huge hard drive loads of ram and tons of software. The unit came by mail and was delivered on time and in excellent shape . No damage to the shipping container and to the product . I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great tablet .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Fusion 5 to take the place of my laptop while traveling, without breaking the bank. So far I have found it to be very fast . It takes a bit for it to turn on but I don&rsquo;t find that bothersome. I able to to remote in to my office fine, with not issues. I purchased the case with the keyboard as well to make it easier for me to right click, etc, instead of touch screen which I love the keyboard case, I love the fact that is light weight . The only reason I didn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars is that the graphics aren&rsquo;t crisp and the lettering is small to read, not really crisp.and clear. Otherwise so far everything is great and it works great for what I use it for and at a price point that is affordable.</p>

<h5 id="super">SUPER!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this a couple times in the last two weeks since I bought it- both for brief times, so far. It connected to my Samsung camera to upload photos to it, which I was then able to put on One Drive for easy access to my prepaid cell phone, when needed for emails or websites when on the go.It has sometimes had mild gliches with timing of processing, or locking up for short while, having to restart once, as I recall, in initial use. Therafter, all worked well, and fyi, no other software/apps have been added, although I&rsquo;ve customized my desktop screen shortcuts.Once I know more, will update my review.Thank you!I&rsquo;ve yet to use it for playing videos or typing much with a wireless keyboard because the case I bought malfunctioned, which is in another review.</p>

<h5 id="power-swith-broken">POWER SWITH BROKEN</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this October 2016 and for a variety reasons not related to computer, it was only used 2-3 times. I pulled it our yesterday to use and found the power button only works sometimes and can take 5-10 minutes of pressing button before it comes on _(maybe).Since I hadn&rsquo;t used it for several months, I charged the battery and tried to turn it on&hellip;.it wouldn&rsquo;t without attempting multiple times. Once I did get it on, battery was 100 % fully charged and it works like a champ&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.until I turn it off and tried to turn on again&hellip;.grrrrrrrrrrrrrSo, now I left to either leave in plugged in and on <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> or toss it&hellip;..double grrrrrrrrr</p>

<h5 id="power-house-of-a-machine">Power-house of a machine!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband and son helped me pick out a new &ldquo;tablet&rdquo;. Needless to say I did not realize that I was getting a little power-house of a &ldquo;tablet&rdquo;. My first package to arrive was the keyboard case. Second package was the case for the tablet and than a couple of days later the Fusion5. I love this little machine. I am still working on learning how this pc really works. The Fusion5 far exceeds my expectations. I really am enjoying this little computer. Good things do come in small packages.</p>
