<h5 id="i-m-glad-i-got-it">I&rsquo;m glad I got it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do Brew In A Bag (BIAB,) and installed this on the Bayou Classic 42 qt SS Pot along with the Heavy Duty <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; Weldless Bulkhead w/ Stainless Steel Valve Heavy Duty <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; Weldless Bulkhead w/ Stainless Steel Valve. It was an easy install using a step drill bit Neiko 10194A Titanium Step Drill Bit, and now I don&rsquo;t think I would brew without it. Yes, you can use a remote digital thermometer, but once this is in the pot, no more worries or wires. It&rsquo;s a breeze to calibrate, very accurate, and easy to read. I can get my water temp up to strike, dough-in, watch my infusion temperature, then heat to mash out without having to screw around with an external thermometer. The first time I used it, my bag got hung on the probe, but now, I just pull the bag from the far side of the pot, it goes right past it. If you BIAB, do yourself a favor and get this.</p>

<h5 id="exceeded-my-expectations">Exceeded my expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am new to homebrewing and I have had a hard time getting a decent thermometer. This is my 3rd thermometer. I opened the box and was immediately impressed. The dial face is large and easy to read. Ambient temperature is spot on out of the box but allows you to adjust if necessary. Installation was easy and took a whole 10 minutes including walking to the garage and grabbing all the tools (I used a step drill bit). No leaks after boiling 3 gallons of water. Came with great instructions that are easy to read and hit all the important stuff.Note: the instructions say that this can not be used for a turkey fryer and you should avoid water contact with the dial face when hot to prevent the dial face from breaking.The only con I can think of is that I can no longer do an ice bath because the dial face may break. Can&rsquo;t fault the product for problems with physics.Dial face is 3.25 inches in diameter. When installed the dial face sits 1 inch from the wall of the stockpot and temp probe enter the pot 2.5 inches.I only wish I would have saved time and just got this thermometer first and wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to use the other 2 shoddy thermometers.</p>

<h5 id="warning-check-it-before-you-use-it">Warning - check it before you use it !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this thermometer with high hopes of using it on my new mash tun build. In the box it looked like a solid product; I was even very impressed that the thermometer came with the necessary wrenches. Before using the thermometer on brew day I decided it would be a good idea to check to make sure it was reading proper temps. I work in a Quality Control lab and have access to calibrated temperature monitoring equipment. I was surprised to find the BC thermometer reading 20 - 30 degrees off. I used the set screw to make the appropriate adjustments and rechecked the thermometer. As it turns out the thermometer would not go above ~120ºF; it appeared to be stuck. Needless to say, I returned the thermometer for a refund and purchased a Blichmann thermometer. Maybe this BC 800-770 was just a defective unit; most others that have purchased the same thermometer seem to be pleased. My advice; check it before you use it. I can&rsquo;t afford to ruin an all grain batch due to something as stupid as a faulty thermometer. As a side note: the Blichmann thermometer I purchased resulted in precise temperature readings right out of the box; no adjustments required.</p>

<h5 id="a-brew-thermometer">A Brew Thermometer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this thermometer as well as a valve to convert a cheap aluminum stockpot into a cheap featured brew vessel. This is the same model thermometer used in a brew kettle I also purchased Bayou Classic 10 Gallon Stainless Steel 6 piece Brew Kettle Set and in addition to the temperature, it has marked ranges for different parts of the brew process, from boil on the high end, to sparge and mash temperatures, and down to a &ldquo;chill&rdquo; range, where you would be lowering the temperature to pitch yeast. I use my newly converted vessel for three purposes involving the thermometer: The first is a HLT, where I can heat my mash and sparge water on my kitchen stove. The second purpose is to act as a mash tun, where I can place the vessel on heat to step the temperature up. The third purpose is to use as an all-in-one brew vessel for extract or partial mash recipes. So far, the o-ring seal has held up, and the thermometer has been accurate enough.</p>

<h5 id="go-buy-a-quality-item-this-is-not-it">Go buy a quality item&hellip;this is not it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the group of people who really dislike this thermometer. I&rsquo;ve had it about a year. Initially I didn&rsquo;t use it for reading temps much. It seemed to work well. However this thing is extremely slow to respond. what do I mean by that? So if I have 180* water sitting in a pot ..this is great. It hits the highest temp spot on. As the water cools it takes at least 20 min for this stupid thermometer to catch up. I would not recommend this item for a mash tun. Those guys who use it I would suggest double checking it with a laser thermometer. This thing is just unacceptable.</p>

<h5 id="great-addition-to-my-brew-kettle">Great addition to my brew kettle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am completely in love with this thermometer. I recently upgraded my home brewing equipment so that I could take on all grain recipes. I picked up the 16 gallon Bayou kettle that didn&rsquo;t have a thermometer already built it. I decided that was something I wanted so that I could keep an eye on the current temp at all times.At first I was planning on using a step bit to drill the hole like a lot of others had recommended, but I decided against it in favor of a knockout tool. If you are planning to install this like I did, I would highly recommend taking this route for a clean, neat hole. You&rsquo;ll want to start out by making a small pilot hole with a drill bit while using drilling oil that is rated for stainless steal, and then stepping up a little bit each time until you make it to the right size for you knockout tool. I used a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; knockout which is slightly bigger than you really need, but the o-rings take care of that. You can pick up a decent knockout set at Harbor Freight for pretty cheap if you don&rsquo;t already own one.On brew day, I was very pleased at how accurate the readings were with no adjustments needed. I was able to read it from over 15 ft away without any issues!</p>

<h5 id="yellow-face-not-white-face">yellow face, not white face</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the one I got has a yellow face, and the numbers are on the inside of graduations, with the brewing temps on the outside of the graduations, it does not seem to be as easily&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="its-nice-and-easy-to-read">Its nice and easy to read</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was surprised by how big the dial is&hellip; I had forgotten or missed the part that said its 3in diameter. Its nice and easy to read. Works fine for my 1bbl system.</p>

<h5 id="completely-worth-the-few-bucks">Completely worth the few bucks!</h5>

<p>This was so much nicer than using my wife&rsquo;s meat thermometer that kept falling off the edge of the pot!</p>

<h5 id="worked-great-and-easy-install">Worked great and easy install</h5>

<p>My <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in step bit was not big enough but with minor sanding and working the bit around I got it slightly larger and the thermometer fit perfectly, after one test boil with no&hellip;</p>

<p>Great installation. Bought two for two different Bayou pots. Great fit and seals great with the 2 rubber washers provided.</p>

<h5 id="wish-it-was-better-built">Wish it was better built</h5>

<p>Love the large easy to read face, but the seal on the dial only lasted two brew days before it started to melt and ooze out the front.</p>
