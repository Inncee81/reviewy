<h5 id="excellent-for-beginners-a-few-suggestions-on-accessories">Excellent for beginners. A few suggestions on accessories.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: For those looking to capture action photography when the subject is not near the camera (e.g., throwing a toy as a dog is running away from you, wildlife and bids), I highly suggest looking into the following lens: Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED Vibration Reduction Zoom Lens with Auto Focus for Nikon DSLR Cameras.Great camera, I purchased this mainly to take action shots of my dog. Luckily I purchased this around Black Friday and it was considerably cheaper than the normal selling price. I love this camera, I have no issues using it and by exporting the images as RAW format I am able to do post-processing in Adobe Softwares (i.e. Photoshop, Lightroom).I am by no means a pro photographer, simply someone who reads information online and then tries to go out and take pictures. Attached as some pictures I have taken as-is (i.e. no post-processing).I also have a few accessories that I found great, they are:- Remote Time Shutter SHOOT MC-DC2 Timer Remote Shutter for Nikon D90 D600 D610 D3100 D3200 D3300 D5000 D5100 D5200 D5300 D7000 Digital SLR Cameras. This is great for wanting to take long exposure shots, as well as when the camera is on a tripod.- Tripod AmazonBasics 50-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag- Telescope/Microscope T-adapter VITE T Adapter 1.25&rdquo; and T2 T Ring Adapter for Any Standard Nikon Lens and Telescope Microscope Metal. Great for taking images of the sky via a telescope, as well as microscope images.- Camera bag Medium Soft Padded Digital SLR Camera Travel Case/Bag with Clip-on Detachable and Adjustable Strap. Large and comfortable to carry.- Camera Cover EasyCover ECND3300B Silicone Camera Case for Nikon D3300/3400 (Black). Gives protection and nice grip.- Starter Filters/Lens Kit 52mm Starter Accessory Kit for Nikon DSLR Bundle with Vivitar Wide Angle and Telephoto Lenses</p>

<p>I LOVE this camera. Its been on numerous trips with me, such as North Carolina, Washington DC, the Adirondacks, Cape Cod, Baltimore, and so many more. The quality is SUPER nice, and the audio from videos is VERY crisp. This was my first DSLR, and I would recommend this to anybody whos looking for a nice simple DSLR with auto and manual settings. Ive had this caera for almost a year now as well and its highly durable! Its been in boats, cars, tree tops, boxes, waterproof bags, you name it. I love my little D3300 and I hope you will too!! 100 outta 5 stars! (if you like my photos follow me on instagram @emmie.phorourke)</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nikon D 3300 is my Christmas present to me. I have used a variety of other brands and have no complaint with them. But when I used my husband&rsquo;s Nikon, I understood what quality is. It is difficult to explain, but if you ever driven as well engineered and fast car, you know what I am saying. I love the colors. Recently I posted a photo of a floral display to Facebook and the brightness of the flowers jumps out.Just borrow someone&rsquo;s Nikon. I think you will understand what I mean. I was concerned about the complexity of the controls, this is my first DSLR. Nothing to worry about. The menu explains itself and is easy to access.</p>

<h5 id="best-picture-quality-of-most-dslr-s-today">Best Picture Quality of Most DSLR&rsquo;s Today</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nikon D3300 has some of the best low light and best picture quality of mid level DSLR cameras, in the APS-C sensor size (this is not a full size sensor, but to get a full size sensor you will need to spend about $2000 or $3000 more).Nikon D3300 is rated 30% higher in image quality compared to the Canon 70D.The Nikon D3300 has a slightly larger sensor than the Canon 70D.I was torn between Canon and Nikon. If you look at all the complaints about Canon in the last 1 or 2 years, you will see that they have been going backwards or sideways, while other companies are making huge strides. The Canon 70D is a smooth fast auto-focusing camera that is silent, however if you set it to auto mode and go take pictures they don&rsquo;t look as good as the Nikon D3300 on auto mode.Comparing pictures side by side with the Canon 70D, the Nikon D3300 has sharper pictures. Zooming in on the photos I took with the 70D yielded a loss of detail. At the same quality settings, same aperture, and shutter speed settings, and with the exact same scene, I am able to zoom in and get better photos from the Nikon D3300, the D3300 really captures crisp photos.The D3300 may be the only camera that doesn&rsquo;t have image quality problems with the 24 Megapixels. There is a megapixel war going on, although sensor sizes aren&rsquo;t increasing, which means the image quality isn&rsquo;t getting better with many cameras, because they are simply trying to cram more pixels with even less light per pixel, which doesn&rsquo;t help matters. However, the D3300 pulls off the impossible and gets beautiful very sharp photos every time.The D3300 does very good video, it&rsquo;s glassy smooth and has tremendously good low light video performance, although the focus noise of the lens will intrude on your videos, because you can hear the little motor churning away to maintain focus. You can alternately use manual focus which works just fine for video. Or you can just push the focus button momentarily to get focus and then maintain your distance, and that will allow the lens to stop hunting for focus, which means you won&rsquo;t hear any noise in your video. To eliminate video focus noise you will need an external mic. The auto focus isn&rsquo;t super fast in video mode but it does have video auto focus mode, and if you had an external mic you could do simple documentaries or YouTube clips just fine and have very clean, very smooth video.For video you could also consider a Sony HX-300 1080 60P, or the HX-400 which has 24P mode too. I&rsquo;ve tried the HX-300 and it has nowhere near the low light performance of the Nikon D3300 but it does do really good video and has smooth, fast, silent auto focus, even at up to 50x zoom, which is ridiculous.The Nikon D3300 takes noise free pictures in any lighting conditions (I haven&rsquo;t tried in total darkness of course). I set it to auto on a black cloudy day, just before rain, and it takes extremely clear pictures with no noise. The same pictures in sunlight were much less sharp, on the Canon 70D. The Canon 70D may be able to match the Nikon if you manually tweak things, but the Nikon doesn&rsquo;t take bad pictures on Auto mode, where as, the Canon 70D on Auto mode takes very average pictures.I noticed the Canon 70D JPG pictures looked very digitized, and not natural, some were not even usable on auto mode, but the Nikon default JPG pictures look more natural. This is probably caused by better JPG compression on the Nikon? In &ldquo;Raw&rdquo; shooting mode I&rsquo;m sure the Canon 70D has nearly equal image quality but I never did try that.Something to note, the Nikon D3300 does not have a low pass filter on the sensor like most current DSLR&rsquo;s, so in theory it should shoot sharper photos more easily. The purpose of the low pass filter is to slightly blur pixels to prevent artifacts, and moire. The Nikon figured out a way around this, so it can shoot sharper without a &ldquo;blur&rdquo; filter. Canon people don&rsquo;t seem to care about anything except loyalty to one brand, so good luck explaining this to them! hehe.This is a very small camera, I would say it feels about 50% smaller than a Canon 70D. It is very light. The buttons are all exceptional. The shutter is very loud as most DSLR cameras probably are. Taking pictures is as easy as turning it on and snapping photos. You&rsquo;ll get amazing results in almost any lighting with this camera.If you want the best quality pictures, and you want to step up to a professional camera without the professional price, here is the camera you want. Image quality is within 1 point of the Nikon D7100. The entry level Canon DSLR mid-frame cameras cannot match the image quality of the newest Nikons.Purchase an 18-200mm lens in the future to give you wide angle room shots, or scenic shots at 18mm, or to zoom in, at 200mm. The stock lens works fine, but it doesn&rsquo;t zoom in very far. That is something to consider in your purchase because of the price of lenses. However, this camera will last you for years, and it is a good investment.Edit: The low light performance of the D3300 is supposed to be very good compared to older Nikon models. I can attest that this is true. In fact, I am shocked at how good the low light performance is. With the use of a tripod, you can turn down the shutter speed so it stays open for several seconds or longer. The picture I took in a non-lighted region of my house looked identical to a normally lit room with bright crisp exposure, and I was able to use ISO 100 setting, there was NO noise. Now this is something you simply cannot do with a point and shoot camera with a smaller sensor. So exciting!I highly recommend the Nikon D3300 because it does everything very well.</p>
