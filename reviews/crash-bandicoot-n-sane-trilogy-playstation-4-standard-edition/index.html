<blockquote>
<p>I got my copy in a day early so I&rsquo;ve had time to get up to &ldquo;The Native Fortress&rdquo; in Crash 1 and about halfway thorugh Crash 2, and I feel safe to say that Vicarious Visions has created an extremely faithful, almost to a fault, reproduction of the original Crash games that should please any fans of the classics.Gameplay wise, these are basically one-to one recreations of the original trilogy. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s probably some small tweaks here and there that I don&rsquo;t notice, but it feels the same as playing the original games. The only really noticeable gameplay change is that Crash 1 now saves after every level, which is a welcome change from the bizarre save system the PS1 version had. You can also use the analogue sticks now, and I found myself switching between the d-pad and the analogue sticks depending on the situation, which was useful. Being so faithful though, means that some of the less savory bits of the original level designs are still problem points here. This isn&rsquo;t so much a problem for Crash 2 (I haven&rsquo;t played either version of Crash 3, yet), but Crash 1 has some needlessly brutal levels, such as The Native Fortress, which is so cheap and full of fake difficulty I moved on to Crash 2 instead. This is no fault of the remaster, I had problems with these levels in the originals too, but coming from today&rsquo;s platformers it may be jarring for new players. Crash 2 is still a phenomenal game, and it doesn&rsquo;t so much have bad levels as it has little gotchas here and there that feel a bit cheap, such as a jump in one of the snow levels where you basically have to be off the ledge before jumping to make it, or some spots in the levels where you&rsquo;re running away from something where you just can&rsquo;t see an obstacle coming up and have to memorize the layout after a few failures. With that said, the parts that are great are still great. Crash is still a joy to move and play as, spin attacking enemies is still super-satisfying, most of the levels are pretty well designed, and the boss fights are fantastic.The visuals are incredible. Every level is filled to the brim with as much detail as possible, and yet it stays completely faithful to the original artistic idea of Crash Bandicoot. Some pretty amazing lighting is on display and you can now see every hair on Crash&rsquo;s hide, which is impressive to look at. What really takes the cake though, is the animation. The original games were a lot more expressive than other PS1 games of the time, featuring some pretty advanced lip sync for their era, and the remaster team has taken that up a notch for the N. Sane Trilogy. Every animation, be it an idle, a victory pose, or the beautifully reworked cutscenes, is fluid and full of character, looking more like something out of an animated movie moreso than a video game. The sounds are all there as well, from the amazing music to Crash screaming WHOA and everyone&rsquo;s favorite, BOODABOOGA.Overall, this is a great value, considering you get three full games in one package, each remastered with astounding care and attention to detail. Some aspects of these games haven&rsquo;t aged well, so newcomers may want to try it at a friend&rsquo;s house or wait for a drop, but if you&rsquo;re a lifelong fan of classic Crash, feel safe jumping right in.</p>

<h5 id="nostalgia-happiness-perfection-must-buy">Nostalgia + Happiness = Perfection + Must Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This game has done what every PlayStation Fan has wanted for the last 11 years since the PS3 came out: a remake of Crash Bandicoot. And it is a VERY well done remake that hits almost every mark. There will be certain things that don&rsquo;t feel or look right but, come on, it&rsquo;s been a long time since we played the originals. The N-Sane Trilogy captures the nostalgia and brings enough new things that make it feel like it wasn&rsquo;t just a cash grab. This is TRUE FAN-SERVICE. You get 3 games remade!? For $40!? Of the once mascot for PlayStation itself!? Don&rsquo;t hesitate. Get it. It&rsquo;s pure clean fun that takes you back down memory lane. Now someone remake Spyro!!! Seriously, just do the same thing you did on Crash for Spyro. Nothing more, nothing less, it&rsquo;ll be a hit.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-so-glad-they-did-a-remake-on-this-game">I am so glad they did a remake on this game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so glad they did a remake on this game!! I felt like I was reliving my childhood while playing. The first 3 Crash Bandicoot games are on this disk. The graphics are great and everything is exactly how I remembered it in the originals. I&rsquo;ve played thru the entire 1st game and I&rsquo;m getting ready to start the 2nd.My 1 and only complaint is that the first game is a little glitchy in certain levels. There were a few levels that my cousin and I played thru where they were very tedious, jumping from platform to platform and we would die every time and couldn&rsquo;t figure out why. Well after dying a million times we figured out that Crash was not jumping straight, even though we were carefully holding the left/right button down on the D-pad. Crash would either jump slightly in front of or behind the platform. It drove us crazy. The only way we could get thru the part is by using the analog.</p>

<p>Only just starting the game but already loving it! Bringing back memories for sure..</p>

<h5 id="a-great-example-of-a-remake-remaster-game">A great example of a remake/remaster game.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This game is really beautiful. As an old fan of Crash Bandicoot games, I greatly appreciate what Activision and Vicarious Visions have done in terms of bringing back Crash Bandicoot. After 100% completing this game, I can safely say that this game is a MUST have for PlayStation fans, especially if you have played the original Crash Bandicoot games on PlayStation 1: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, and Crash Bandicoot: Warped. Everything in this game is beautifully recreated while staying faithful to the original games. So, what are you waiting for? Purchase this game now, pick up a controller, and let yourself be transported back twenty years when playing it. Finally, I would like to say thank you to Activision and Vicarious Visions for creating this beautiful game!Disclaimer: In order to fully appreciate this game, you MUST play the original games on PlayStation 1 first. Otherwise, you will have a hard time when playing this game since Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is challenging but rewarding at the same time if you are able to complete it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always skeptical of a remaster, reissue, reimagining, or whatever. But this is great, very faithful to the originals (of which I have some control issues, kind of wish those would have been addressed), and looks fantastic.</p>

<h5 id="first-time-playing-crash-bandicoot">First time playing Crash Bandicoot</h5>

<p>Have played the first Crash for the very first time and have to admit, the game is pretty fun to play when you are not trophy hunting. It is well worth the money and if you never played it before I think you should give it a shot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love love love how much better the graphics are! This game has three games in one. You get to chose which game you want to play at the beginning. The game is the same as the old games but the new graphics give it a whole new feel and a refreshing feeling as if you were playing new levels. All the same bosses are there and all the same music is there but slightly better. Graphics aren&rsquo;t as boxy and pixally as before.</p>
