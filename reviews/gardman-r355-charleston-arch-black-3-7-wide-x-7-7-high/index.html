<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-good-value-for-the-price">A good value for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to put together and is a good value for the price. To anchor it, I went to Home Depot and got four <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in x 3 ft pieces of rebar. I set the trellis in place, marked the position of the legs, moved the trellis out of the way, pounded the rebar halfway into the ground at those positions, and then slid the trellis right over the rebar. I believe that it is sturdy enough to survive the high winds that we can get at times. Now, all we need to do is go to the nursery and get some climbing flowers to plant next to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shiny-arch">Shiny arch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a lovely trumpet vine growing up an oak tree. The tree succumbed to disease and I was left with my vine lying on the ground. An arch seemed the perfect solution to keep my vine blooming. This does support the large vine. It isn&rsquo;t thick but it is bushy.The arch has a shiny coating which frankly does not look as rich as another one I purchased with a matte finish. I would not have a very strong vine growing on this such as wisteria, but for lighter weight ones, it seems to be adequate.My 13 year old grandson put it together, so it was not that complicated. It is lightweight yet went into the ground solidly without needing extra supports; although I had to drill a hole in one of the former tree&rsquo;s roots.The listing claims you get a ground hole-maker to provide for easy fitting. There was none in our box.The directions were simple and the arch serves its purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-no-stability-in-ground">Great But NO stability in ground</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pleased with quality, easy to assemble, (although two people would have been a lot easier when moving upright and placing in yard.) I&rsquo;m only a little disappointed there are no strap-down type of metal stakes, or a place to insert them. What you see is what you get. The square legs are hard to insert into the ground, and in doing so I&rsquo;m aware they will rust/wear out, much sooner than an arbor should last me. Also, directions unclear for placement of bolt for top of arbor: top? bottom? Bar on top? Bottom?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-looking-arch">Nice looking arch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a couple of trees are starting to impinge on my path to the backyard and it does the job of holding them back a bit. And it looks good doing it. It is kind of light, but as the trees are pushing on it, it is held quite steady, even when I&rsquo;ve run garden carts into it. It was easy to build&ndash;I had my sister and nephew with me and we put it together in about 10 minutes&ndash;including throwing away the waste. It would have taken me longer alone, but not much longer. The hardest part alone would have been moving it into place. Glad that I had assistance for that. I bought it this spring, so I don&rsquo;t know how it will hold up yet, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that it will.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-sturdy-archway-for-the-yard">This is a sturdy archway for the yard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a sturdy archway for the yard. I purchased it to use for some parties I am having this summer and recently decorated it for a baby shower. Everyone loved it and it made a great backdrop for photos. It stakes easily into the ground and was easy to put together. Once I am done with my parties I will add it to my yard, permanently, and plant some vines near it. It seems like it will hold up for many years to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-sturdy-attractive">Easy, Sturdy, Attractive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked the look of this arbor and plan to plant wisteria to grow over it. My husband said it was very easy to assemble. He had to reposition it several times because our yard is uneven, which is no fault of the arbor lol! Also, we were going to paint it white but, the finish is so nice we kept it black. It&rsquo;s very sturdy, but will probably need realignment, each Spring, as our clay soil heaves up. You should see our street sign! Again, not the fault of the arbor. We love it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adequate-for-the-price">adequate for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not going to get good quality wrought iron at this price. However, this metal arch is good for temporary use or where it can be attached to a fence or wall for added support. It would not support a heavy climbing rose out in the open. But if attached as noted above it will support the weight just not much sail effect from high winds. The design is basic and fits a lot of different styles. It is very easy assemble. I would drill holes at the unions and add some extra screws for added stability. You can use re-bar stakes with hose clamps for added strength too&hellip;.enjoy&hellip;it&rsquo;s a nice arch for the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-peasy-and-i-love-the-trellis">Easy peasy and I LOVE the trellis</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My order came and i was short one stabilizer bar. I called the company to just see if they could send that one. They do not sell pieces. What did I do? A return&hellip;.. However, I put up the trellis in my yard while waiting the new one. When the new one arrived I pulled out the stabilizer bar and returned that one. No repacking, no problem really. Easy peasy and I LOVE the trellis.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-and-looks-great-i-really-like-it">Well made and looks great, I really like it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made and looks great, I really like it. The only thing I would change is some exposed bolts on the arch where the cross supports attatch</p>
