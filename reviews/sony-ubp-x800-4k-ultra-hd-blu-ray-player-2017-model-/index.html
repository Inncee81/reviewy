<h5 id="worth-the-wait">Worth the Wait</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to see that this player is finally showing up on the actual store shelves here in Houston. I tried for at least a month to buy one locally without being able to find any place that could actually deliver one. Finally broke down and bought one via an Amazon partner vendor, and I&rsquo;m happy as can be to have one now. (Coincidentally, they started showing up on the shelves of the Best Buy stores here in Houston about three days before mine was delivered to me&hellip;on the bright side, I saved a few bucks by not having to pay Texas sales tax&hellip;and delivery was free.)Unfortunately, the player does not come with the cables necessary to get the best picture and sound, so if you order it for delivery, you will need to have the high quality cables on hand when it arrives. That aside, hook up and system set up are very intuitive and I was up and running in a matter of minutes. I&rsquo;m running the player through a Sony 4K television set and have been generally pleased with the picture and sound quality that I&rsquo;m getting (also using a Sanyo sound bar system).4K discs are still relatively limited and relatively expensive when compared to the other types, but prices should begin dropping as soon as the demand rises for the discs, so that will get better. Right now I&rsquo;m fairly dependent on Netflics and Amazon Prime Video for my 4K content, but I&rsquo;m also very pleasantly surprised by the high quality video that can be had by playing a standard Blu-Ray disc through the system. Even regular DVDs look better than ever.I did have to do an immediate system update on the player before I could get it to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; and connect to my home network without having to do set it up again, but since that was done I have had no problem with the player connecting to the network. The system, it appears, will be updated at least once a month for the time being, so that&rsquo;s something to keep in mind if you don&rsquo;t set your preferences to automatically check for updates.One more tip: the player, believe it or not, actually comes with a physical user&rsquo;s manual&hellip;and it is well written. Take a few minutes to go over each of the settings that you can control via your preferences because the system defaults may not be best for your individual needs. It&rsquo;s worth the time, and it makes a huge difference in video and sound quality.Overall, I&rsquo;m very happy with the system right now and use it several times a week. I&rsquo;ve been told that it&rsquo;s state of the art in 4K dvd players, and I can easily believe that based upon what I&rsquo;ve seen so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes! If you&rsquo;re looking for a great player, this is a definite buy. Things were a little problematic at first, being an early adopter and It wouldn&rsquo;t update the firmware, the apps were coming in slow. Now all I&rsquo;m missing is a YouTube app and I could get rid of my Roku 3&hellip;.that&rsquo;s how happy I am with it. It does an excellent job on upscaling 1080p, excellent 4K pictures with a non HDR set. Impressive!&hellip;.. a lot of bang for the buck.</p>

<h5 id="heavy-behemoth-player-that-whelms-you-with-an-ultra-high-resolution-watching-experience">Heavy Behemoth Player That Whelms You With An Ultra-High Resolution Watching Experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, this is a large, heavy, and beefy (functions) 4k blu ray player. If you remember the first DVD players that came out in the early oughts (2000) and how heavy they were &mdash; and also how they long they lasted, this is the feeling you will get with the X800.Weight: 8.5 lb (~4kg)Dimensions: 17&rdquo;Width x 10&rdquo;Depth x 2.2&rdquo;Height ( ~43cm x ~25cm x ~6cm)When picking it up, it feels like quality because of the weight, the metal casing, and the &lsquo;solid&rsquo; placement in your hands or if things are stacked on top (which I don&rsquo;t recommend).The main purpose of this player is to play 4k Blu ray movies. The latter is usually labeled fairly conspicuously over the top of the movie box. The reason for the new player is mainly because regular blu ray players cannot play 4k movies, not to mention if you have a 4k TV you want to be able to get full use of it. The good news is that regular blu rays <em>can</em> be played on this 4k player, with them being upscaled to match the 2160p format. What this means, if you don&rsquo;t already know, is that a program within the 4k player will &lsquo;guess&rsquo; at what pixels should be used from your 1080p source to expand the pixel count/resolution to match the 2160p resolution. Going further:[&mdash;Upscaling&mdash;]2160p (4k) has ~8.5 million pixels. Anytime you watch anything 4k on your TV, the screen is being filled with that many pixels.1080p (HD) has ~2 million pixels.If you are watching a regular blu ray on this 4k player in a 2160p resolution setting, there are ~6.5 million &lsquo;missing&rsquo; pixels. So the player will guess the 6.5 million pixels based on what&rsquo;s available in the original 1080p source. I can say this turns out really well with this player. 1080p blu-rays, while still being eye pleasingly sharp and detailed, look even more so with this player on a 4k TV. While it&rsquo;s not as &lsquo;organic&rsquo; as a regular 4k blu-ray, it still is very impressive to watch your old collection with this upscaling.That being said, let&rsquo;s get to the player:[&mdash;Speed&mdash;]Loading of 4k movies is relatively fast and about the same as my blu-ray player. Nothing really to notice here. Even when navigating and using the included apps, it is fairly snappy.[&mdash;WiFi&mdash;]This uses a WiFi card with MIMO and maxed out my connection. Nothing to be said here: fast, responsive, no drops. Just like my PC card.[&mdash;Bluetooth&mdash;]Has a bluetooth connection where you can use bluetooth headphones to watch your movies in silence. Worked great with me sitting about 15ft away.[&mdash;Quality&mdash;]Not much to say here except that for what my 4k TV could give was a beautiful, clear and as precise a picture you could want. In result, I don&rsquo;t believe the X800 is the bottleneck as it outputs exactly &lsquo;as is&rsquo; from the source material.[&mdash;HDMI Cables&mdash;]Hopefully you read this portion before you purchase new cables. First: If you need a HDMI cable longer than ~30 ft, then you actually would do well to purchase an HDMI 2.0a, for example. For those of you that do not need a &gt; 30ft cable, you can be happy to know that you likely can keep your existing HDMI cable and have zero issues. I know I did. Generally you need a certain throughput (around 18 gbps I believe) to get 60fps from a 4k source. Below 30 ft HDMI cables (of all types and version) can usually handle this with no problems. Moreover, remember most movies are 24 fps, so this is all moot for the most part and generally only tied to live action 60fps 4k television. To sum up, though, if you aren&rsquo;t using a cable greater than 30ft, you can probably keep your regular HDMI. Save the money for some 4k movies![&mdash;Outputs/Inputs&mdash;]1 x Rear Coaxial1 x Ethernet2 x Rear HDMI1 x Front USBThe idea here, then, is to have an HDMI running to your TV box/TV and one HDMI running to your surround sound.[&mdash;Freebies&mdash;]This player comes (in the box) with 4k Blu rays: 1. The Magnificent Seven (2016) and 2. Ghostbusters (2016). It says you also can pick two more if you register when you first get it. I suppose this means you get 4 free movies.<strong>UPDATE</strong> I initially said this player comes with 2 movies in the box, and I don&rsquo;t believe that to be true when you buy at retail. The reason why my unit came with 2 movies, I believe, is because mine was a review unit. So, being on the safe side, assume it does not come with movies but you can send off for them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;New technology and early adoption usually means higher pricing. However, the price tag for this is not outlandish and in line with how much I paid for a fairly early, premium blu ray player. It is still running flawlessly. For a player that will keep you future-proofed&hellip;until 8k&hellip;this is a premium player that will keep you streaming, &lsquo;bluetoothing&rsquo;&hellip;all in high resolution HDR/UHD.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-player">Love This Player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I see that many of the negative reviews are regarding the apps. I have an Amazon Fire TV for that. My rating is strictly for the performance playing Blu-rays and DVDs, and for that this player is great. Only negatives I can find are that for a high end device the remote is not backlit and I did have one very short one second glitch on a disc where the picture went black. Could not repeat the error. Fantastic build quality, easy to use menus, excellent color accuracy. I just hope that a future firmware update will add Dolby Vision support, otherwise I might have to reduce my rating to 4 stars.</p>
