<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="moving-into-vr">Moving into VR</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first I was nervous to buy these for my PS VR because I heard some people (even Sony) saying that the batteries from the PS3 models may not even work after all the years of sitting in their boxes unused, and that we should just buy the new ones. However, I&rsquo;m here to say that these do indeed work. Now I&rsquo;ve only used them once so far, and I don&rsquo;t know how long the batteries will last for, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re not as bad as Sony described and they just want you to spend twice as much for the &ldquo;new&rdquo; ones. Overall if you&rsquo;re looking to buy a PS VR and your the 85% of people that didn&rsquo;t already own a Move Controller, then I&rsquo;d say just buy these. If you do get a dead one in the mail you can always get your money back. Also keep in mind that these do not come with a charging cable (just the remote and wrist strap) and that a PS4 controller cable will NOT fit, it needs to be a PS3 or any other type of Mini-USB lead cable. .To sync the Move Controller with your PS4 do the following:- Make sure PS4 is on (lol)- Plug a PS3 controller cable (or any other Mini-USB lead) into the PS4&rsquo;s USB port and the other end into the Move Controller- Hold down the PlayStaion button on the Move and wait for the ball to light up.- Then it&rsquo;ll ask you to do some onscreen excises to help pair the Move with the Camera.- Enjoy, and let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<h5 id="works-great-fast-response-younger-kids-may-have-a-problem">Works great, fast response. Younger kids may have a problem.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought three of these motion controllers to go with the starter bundle pack which already came with one controller. The response is great and appears to feel like it&rsquo;s &ldquo;real time.&rdquo; Even games in which you can rotate your wrist when throwing a ball (to simulate a spinning motion) are accurately picked up.The controller&rsquo;s buttons are well placed and even our six-year old son has no problems with gripping the controller and pressing the buttons with his thumb or forefinger. With games that require the pairing of two devices, there is no issue with them working together and responding as you would expect.We did have a problem with our three-year old trying to calibrate the system to himself. At first we thought we may have a bad controller, but after I was able to calibrate the controller to myself, we figured our son was just too short for the system to recognize him and for it to work properly. For that reason only I didn&rsquo;t give it a full five stars. For now, he simply uses Daddy&rsquo;s controller so he feels like he&rsquo;s a part of the fun too.When you&rsquo;re in between games, the motion controller will also navigate the PS3&rsquo;s main menu. I don&rsquo;t understand why Sony makes a navigation controller to do this task. Buying a navigation controller seems to be a waste of money; at least to me. I would suggest not purchasing one.I haven&rsquo;t played any other motion games (i.e., Wii), so I can&rsquo;t make an intelligent comparison among the PS3 and other gaming devices. It&rsquo;s my opinion that the PS3 motion controller has excellent response with the games we&rsquo;ve played so far. To date, we have only played the Sports Champions game that came with the starter bundle. Given the family fun we&rsquo;ve had so far, we&rsquo;ll will certainly be looking for other games to enjoy as well.</p>

<p>Works great! Fully compatible with the Playstation VR. However, they do not come with a charging cable. At half the price, they are a much better value than the new PS4 version.</p>

<h5 id="a-wii-bit-better-than-nintendo">A Wii bit better than Nintendo</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Playstation Move was a product that I was excited about as soon as I heard it was coming out. I know some people might think that this is just a rip-off of a Nintendo Wii controller, but that would really be selling this controller short. It has the added feature of being tracked by the Playstation Eye camera in addition to having built in accelerometers. This means that when you tilt your hand or orient the controller in a certain way, that it will be mirrored on the screen and in turn affect your gameplay.The controller feels very solid, and it is powered by a rechargable battery just like the standard PS3 controllers. I plug mine into the PS3 when I&rsquo;m not using them so when the PS3 is on, they charge in 3-5 hours and are back to full. I would probably recommend getting a standalone Move controller dock that will plug into the wall and keep the controllers charged at all times if you don&rsquo;t use them frequently.The setup is very easy, just a few clicks of the PS Move button near your shoulder and torso is about all it takes to sync. It is also kind of cool how the orb on the top of the controller changes depending on the game and the player (when playing multiplayer).The only thing I did find a bit annoying is that sometimes it is difficult to use this controller to navigate the PS3 main menu and then some of the game menus outside of basic PS Move play. Other than that, this product is very good, and really does work as well as advertised.</p>
