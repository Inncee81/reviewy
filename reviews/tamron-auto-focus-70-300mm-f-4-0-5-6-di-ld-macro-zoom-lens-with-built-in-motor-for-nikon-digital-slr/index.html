<p>From the Manufacturer
Designed for optimum handling ease and portability (it weighs only 458g <16.2oz.> ), it’s ideal for handheld shooting with full-frame and APS-C format SLRs. Its unsurpassed close-focusing ability (down to 0.95m (3.1 feet ) or 1:2 in macro mode) makes it perfect for nature and portrait photography.</p>

<p>Zoom in to 300mm from a distance</p>

<p>AF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Di LD Macro Zoom Lens Features
Low Dispersion (LD) Glass for Greater Lens Sharpness
Low dispersion (LD) glass elements in a lens help reduce chromatic aberration; the tendency of light of different colors to come to different points of focus at the image plane. Chromatic aberration reduces the sharpness of an image, but glass with an extremely low dispersion index, has less of a tendency to separate (defract) a ray of light into a rainbow of colors. This characteristic allows the lens designer to effectively compensate for chromatic aberration at the center of the field (on axis), a particular problem at long focal lengths (the telephoto end of the zoom range), and for lateral chromatic aberration (towards the edges of the field) that often occurs at short focal lengths (the wide-angle end of the zoom range.)&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="amazing-lens">Amazing lens.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this lens. I purchased this for my Nikon D3300 and am incredibly impressed with its quality. I have taken some nature photos and sports photos and am delighted with the sharpness of the photos. For the price and the end results this lens is nearly perfect. I love the fact it has autofocus as well but is easy to use in manual mode as well. Great lens for both up close and far away photos.</p>

<h5 id="loving-taking-photos-with-this">Loving taking photos with this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Lens for my Pentax Camera!! I recommend buying this when in stock because it was out of stock for several months.. Quality of this lens is excellent and I feel it takes GREAT photos for a beginner like me!! I didn&rsquo;t want to put a lot of money into my camera because I am just learning and I want to make sure I will stick with this hobby BUT I am very happy with this lens and think it will last me for a while!! I love the MACRO mode and the price is excellent! Autofocus works great as well!</p>

<h5 id="a-good-lens-for-a-canon-camera-at-a-great-price">A GOOD LENS FOR A CANON CAMERA AT A GREAT PRICE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m using this Tamron lens on my new Canon 5D MKIII, it works great and the price is amazing. I&rsquo;ve been taking pictures of little lizards and birds flying over head with it and could not be happier. I&rsquo;ve even used it with the Tamron 1.4x tele extender and the camera will still auto focus with that set up. The pictures are sharp, the mechanisms feel good in use and it feels like a Canon high quality product even though it&rsquo;s not. Did I mention the price? Amazing quality for such a tiny purchase price.This lens worked so well I&rsquo;ve purchased some other Tamron products and have been quite satisfied.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-lense">amazing lense</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome lense for the money arrived in great shape works really good on my D3200 Nikon. takes really great pictures. i am very pleased with the peformance, would i purchase this lense again absoloutly without a doubt as faras the pros are cocerned, we all know there are better high priced lenses out there. you would be hard pressed to do better in this price range, remember if its a great picturei its mostly on the photographer and your approch to the subject matter. i have been out done by a bronnie , by my dad, he did it just to make a point while teaching me about photography, and he was a pro.</p>

<h5 id="got-mine">Got Mine!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the reasons why Amazon is so awesome! I have been looking for a second lens for my D5000 for about 6 months. Lenses aren&rsquo;t cheap, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make the wrong decision. I purchased my Nikon with the 18mm to 55mm lens. But, as a nature photographer, some of the shots require a lens with a longer focal length. So, after consulting some of my photography friends, and reading the many reviews, I settled on this one. The zoom is smooth and the lens is very high quality; the optics, everything! My expectations, from reading the reviews, have been met. The lenses auto-focus is slow, but most of my work does not require a fast focus as it would in sporting events. Everything else about this lens is high value. I expect this lens will continue allowing me to win awards for my work, as well as continually inspiring people that follow my work. While I do not make any money for my photography, it is one of the most serious hobbies I have ever had. If you are like me, and enjoy nature photography, I strongly encourage you to consider this lens. Tamron, thank you for producing such a high quality lens at an affordable price - you have won over a new customer today!</p>

<h5 id="great-buy-for-your-money">Great buy for your money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Novice photo hobbyist here,Quite possibly the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon. As a refurbished product I would have expected to find some flaws (as I have with other refurbished Nikon lenses), whether it be scratches on the body or a hitch in the focus ring, but I found nothing. Wonderful image quality, fast autofocus, and amazing zoom. I bought this as an entry level macro lens and it has blown me away.For those of you who are concerned about shipping lenses: Don&rsquo;t worry. All you get is the lens, it was tripled wrapped in bubble wrap, suran wrapped to a piece of elevated cardboard. It was essentially in a box within a box. I wish I had thought to take a picture because it was better packaging than some other lenses I&rsquo;ve had shipped.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-lens-i-use-it-on-my-nikon-d3200">This is a great lens. I use it on my Nikon D3200</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great lens. I use it on my Nikon D3200. I use this mostly for action shots, soccer games, horse shows and sleigh riding. I also get great action shots of the dog playing, running, swimming. I do use it for still pics of the kids too and get amazing pics! However, the main reason I chose to purchase this lens was to use it for action shots and I am not disappointed. The zoom was very much needed because many times we are seated in the bleachers quite a distance away from the soccer players and I get some pretty nice shots. The price is great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-lens">Awesome Lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lens is absolutely amazing! The versatility alone makes this worth every penny. Item arrived very quickly and in great packaging as to avoid damage. I love every picture I have taken with this lens, be it up close or far away. A definite must for beginners like myself.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-amatures-or-enthusiasts">Good for Amatures or Enthusiasts</h5>

<p>For the money, this is a pretty good lense. Used it at an airshow and got some great shots. It can be a little slow at focusing but it usually does alright.</p>

<p>Very good zoom lens. Oddly, it is much sharper then my Nikkor 18-200mm - @ <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> the price. I was not expecting that.</p>

<p>Amazing lens.. sounds like parts are loose inside but it&rsquo;s just the way the lens is made. Also slides out when gravity takes over. Still&hellip; awesome lens for the price.</p>

<h5 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has a tendency to jam and freeze, but with patience it will take a good photo. However I&rsquo;d recommend saving up for a better quality Nikon Lens.</p>
