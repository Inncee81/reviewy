<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="tough-day-on-the-mountain">tough day on the mountain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>we have used Lucky Bum Ski Wedge in the past - with quite a lot of success. However, this time, the conditions were wet, and raininy - and not really a ski weekened&hellip; but we went anyway. we had a really hard time tightening this product enough to overcome the set slippery conditions. They kept sliding off the ski tips. in those conditions, I was really wishing that it had a larger handle for tightening the screw. I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s a defect in the product, or just that we were using it in undesirable conditions&hellip; either way, at the end of the day we had given up trying to put these on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-friend-got-the-velcro-kind-and-they-were-much-better">My friend got the velcro kind and they were much better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking at the pictures, it&rsquo;s hard to tell but the black plastic &lsquo;C&rsquo; part is not big enough to put the screw through the holes in the front of the skis. Therefore, installing this product on the skis requires you to really tighten the screws on the sides of the skis and damage them. They actually came off a few times for my son. My friend got the velcro kind and they were much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-work-well-with-lucky-bum-skis">Does not work well with lucky bum skis.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the lucky bums easy wedge as well as the lucky bum skis and harness, I was disappointed that the easy wedge did not fit easily onto the lucky bum ski, it would pop off easily and broke when I ran over it with my ski. The lucky bum ski comes with holes in the tips but the easy wedge was not able to attach to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-little-ones">Great for little ones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this with my 4 year old son. It was great. The ski instructors at whitefish were using these on the little kids as well. He still was able to &ldquo;walk&rdquo; around with his skis to get around on flat areas by the magic carpet. My 8 year old was strong enough she didn&rsquo;t need these and they would have gotten in the way. I strongly suggest the co-pilot ski trainer as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-wedge-helper">Best Wedge Helper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the first wedge tip holder I bought and it&rsquo;s definitely the best of the three that I&rsquo;ve tried. I bought the Edgie Wedgie for a friend, and a velco one came with a harness I bought.I liked the Lucky Bums the best because it seemed to be the sturdiest; I liked that it was made of elasticized cord rather than just tubing. While it might not be the case, the Edgie&rsquo;s tubing seemed like it would come off whereas the Lucky Bums&rsquo; band seems firmly attached to the clamps. The clamps on the Lucky Bums Easy Wedge are also slightly wider and fit a wider variety of skis. We actually had a pair of skis that the Edgie Wedgie&rsquo;s clamp was too small for. Overall, I&rsquo;m very pleased with the Easy Wedge. It does exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to do and rarely comes off the skis; when it does come off, it&rsquo;s very easy to reattach. I feel bad that I purchased another brand for my friend as I thought they were pretty much the same but they&rsquo;re definitely not!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-the-first-time">Broke the first time&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used for the first time today at Keystone and the plastic clamp cracked when I screwed it down slightly. Was hoping to get a season out of this and disappointed by the quality. Purchased 1 year ago and used for the first time today, maybe there is a short shelf life?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-d-like-my-money-back">I&rsquo;d like my money back</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The black plastic broke in half when I installed it on my daughter&rsquo;s skis - it broke immediately.Later I glued it back together and we tried it on the slopes; it didn&rsquo;t really help her make a wedge to slow down. I&rsquo;d like my money back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-10-you-will-ever-spend-a-must-for-groms">BEST $10 YOU WILL EVER SPEND. A MUST FOR GROMS.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our one previous outing was a disaster, but a couple runs with this on, and my 8 yr old boy was hooked. Now he can&rsquo;t get enough. Best $10 I have EVER spent. We didn&rsquo;t have any issues with it coming off, like some have reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of-money-breakable-plastic">Waste of money. Breakable plastic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Horrible. Broke before was able to use it! Was screwing in the screw onto the ski tip and the black plastic portion broke.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeps coming off skis</p>

<h5 id="this-was-recommended-by-amazon-to-go-with-the-lucky-bums-skiis">This was recommended by Amazon to go with the Lucky Bums skiis &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was recommended by Amazon to go with the Lucky Bums skiis I bought and they do not work together. Disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-great">Work great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very effective but you do have to have them tight especially when the kids are walking they can yank off</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dont-stay-attached">Dont stay attached.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These never stay attached. They dont clamp on deep enough so they are always popping off. I spend more time trying to reattach these then I do skiing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-work-great-older-originals-do-not-fit-newer-type-skis">These work great. older originals do not fit newer type skis</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work great . older originals do not fit newer type skis, thee are a great replacement</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-bother">Don&rsquo;t bother</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not pair with the Lucky Bum skis we bought. Did a lot of damage to skis. Totally ineffective clamps</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic product! Worked great. Easy to use and great results!</p>
