<h5 id="works-great-everytime">Works Great Everytime!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this garden sprayer now for about 5 months and It has always worked perfectly. This sprayer is so easy to use. The way it works is you fill the sprayer with your choice chemical, pump the handle until the air pressure builds (you will feel the resistance in the handle when the pressure is built) point the nozzle and spray. So easy! The container is a good thick quality, wand is 12&rdquo; and the hose is 28&rdquo; which makes maneuverability nice and easy. This sprayer has a convenient funnel top which helps prevent liquid from running down the sides when you are filling it.I use this with insecticidal soap on my houseplants and on my garden plants. The spray is nice and even and it has a nice wide spray width. The nozzle is adjustable and the wand is easy to reach into bushes or up into small trees. This sprayer mists everything leaving a nice coat on the leaves without dumping out too much product. This is nice because my liquid lasts longer. I have never had any issues with this sprayer and would recommend this. If this review is helpful to you in any way, please let me know by clicking on helpful. Thank you so much!! :)</p>

<h5 id="four-years-later-still-working">Four years later, still working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the Chapin four years ago and it&rsquo;s still working, with occasional tip cleaning using vinegar or CLR. It&rsquo;s never quite as &ldquo;misty&rdquo; as I&rsquo;d like, but it&rsquo;s adequate for spraying weeds, and for the price I can&rsquo;t complain. The wand and tips are usually the weak points in these home sprayers, so I looked into buying new ones but it was more than the complete tank.It probably doesn&rsquo;t help that I leave chemicals in it for extended periods. I once left liquid in it so long that I forgot whether it was weed killer or insecticide, so disposed of it by spraying an area that needed both. I then decided to get another dedicated sprayer and label them. This seemed easier than cleaning them out after every use because that&rsquo;s just not gonna happen, to be honest.The lock and release action of the pump mechanism for carrying is smoother and easier than with others I&rsquo;ve tried, and given the abuse it takes it&rsquo;s a great deal.The Smith was twice as much, and the wand is a bit longer. It feels more robust and sprays mistier, but that could change. The twist and lock action isn&rsquo;t as smooth as the Chapin, but other than that they&rsquo;re pretty similar.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-has-12-inch-wand-28-inch-hose-and-compatible-with-the-chapin-32-inch-extendable-wand">Great product has 12 inch wand, 28 inch hose, and compatible with the Chapin 32 inch extendable wand.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an extremely well made garden sprayer, easy to use, maintains good pressure, clear volume markings.It takes about 3 pressurizations to empty the sprayer. I have to give kudos to Chapin. Not only is this a great sprayer, but when I called them to make sure the extendable wand I wanted to add was compatible, the person who answered knew immediately what I was doing, and was also aware that the nozzle that came with this sprayer would NOT fit the wand and sent me one that would fit at no charge which arrived before the sprayer and wand did! Now this is just a small plastic part, but essential for operation. I am very impressed with this company&rsquo;s foresight and service and will look at other Chapin products in the future.Now I&rsquo;d like to also rave about the wand purchased through Amazon, Chapin #6-7770 32-Inch Extendable Wand with Viton. The extendable part is brass and is slightly bent at the tip. The bend is important because just by turning your hand slightly while spraying, you can get the underside of the leaves. It fits the hose that comes with the sprayer. When it is fully extended, I can get the top branches of a pear tree that is roughly 15 feet high.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-but-life-expectancy-about-one-year">good product, but life expectancy about one year&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for sprayer compression bottle listed her under name &ldquo;Chapin 20000 1-Gallon Poly Lawn and Garden Sprayer&rdquo;.It works, I was able to spray all my weeds with success. Long handle very useful and allows you to direct spray where it is intended.So why is the four star and not five? The reason is simple, quality of the product and plastic used is very poor. Bottle quality is OK, it has to be or it will not hold pressure, but the actual sprayer is very flimsy and will not last. To be honest, this product never lasted me more than one year. I get it every spring and no matter what company or how much I pay for it lasts the same. It is true you can replace broken/clogged parts, but it will cost you about the same as replace the whole thing, so why bother&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-squirty-and-spraying-pump-pressure-pot-squirt-gun-works-really-well-and-made-well">It&rsquo;s a squirty and spraying pump pressure pot squirt gun! works really well. and made well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have two of these and I use them for multiple things.I spray ant hills with a natural ant hill irritant to make them move off my general walking areas like around my fence gates that i can&rsquo;t open when they build mounds there.I use it to stain my fences, spray the stain and wipe it with a cloth to evenly coat surfaces, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I carry two. you could paint like this too. screw Huckleberry Finn&rsquo;s method of scamming everyone to do it for me, use this. it&rsquo;s simple.I use it to spray a chemical called Wet and Forget, it&rsquo;s mixed with water and i can pressurize it pretty good to hit the high areas with an even spray and put enough on it to wet the entire surface. - that product is great - this pump sprayer is cheap and effective to deliver it.I live in the south and we get mossy surfaces that don&rsquo;t get direct sunlight. I could build an Archimedes laser system to bounce the sunlight across the side of the house to kill that stuff but this pump spray and a low-cost alternative that works.It would be cool if you cold make something to look like a Ghostbusters thing. I would love to run around my yard and house with two of these engineered into mock ghost busters piped system and do my yard work and useful type things with these tanks on my back like a slime shooter or something.. pew pew. yay for home ownership.But you have to pump this a lot. and it gets really pressurized, so if you have chemicals that are slightly toxic or irritants, make sure you depressurize it by holding the trigger until it doesn&rsquo;t spray before you open it. and I suggest doing that for storage. don&rsquo;t keep it pressurized. the thing will explode under pressure in a hot garage.Safety first.</p>
