<h5 id="an-upgrade-in-read-speed-write-speeds-vary">An upgrade in READ speed, write speeds vary</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The SanDisk Ultra 80MB/s is a new card that replaces the Ultra 40MB/s. The 80MB/s is the read speed only. SanDisk refers to the write speed as Class 10, which means the card maintains at least 10MB/s continuous write, but does not state a maximum write speed. I tested the following Ultra 80MB/s cards: (2) 32GB, 64GB and 128GB and compare with the previous Ultra 40MB/s cards. I use CrystalDiskMark benchmark (5 passes, 1GB random data) and USB 3.0 card reader.SanDisk Ultra 80MB/s (new version, September 2015)32GB (1) Read: 94.2 MB/s Write: 43.0 MB/s32GB (2) Read: 97.7 MB/s Write: 20.9 MB/s64GB Read: 82.4 MB/s Write: 19.1 MB/s128GB Read: 97.7 MB/s Write: 38.5 MB/sSanDisk Ultra 40MB/s (old version, 2014-2015)32GB Read: 47.8 MB/s Write: 19.9 MB/s64GB Read: 47.8 MB/s Write: 16.2 MB/sREAD Speed: Ultra 80MB/s cards exceed 80MB/s read speed and are much faster than the old version. This allows fast downloads from the card to your computer when used with a USB 3.0 card reader. Using USB 2.0 it limits the speed to about 35MB/s.WRITE Speed: Benchmarks can be deceiving! The benchmarks show a big difference in write speed between cards. One 32GB card measured 43MB/s but one from a different source was 20.9MB/s. When writing actual files the write speed varies during transfer. The 128GB card benchmark was 38.5MB/s write, but transferring a large file I see a range between 16-24MB/s throughout the transfer. Only the faster 32GB card was able to maintain above 40MB/s write speed for the duration. There was also a big difference in 512K random write performance between cards (~1MB/s vs 20-24MB/s).Write speed of 15-20MB/s seems to be typical of Ultra cards. They are good for general photography, but not fast enough for extended continuous shooting. Once you hit the buffer limit in the camera it can become very sluggish if the write speed is not high enough. If you only take one shot at a time the write speed speed should be sufficient.I am tempted to remove a star because of the variance between cards, but all cards exceeded their speed ratings. The improved READ speed over the previous version is a benefit. Actual write speed may not be much better than the older cards. You might get an extra fast sample, but do not buy this card expecting outstanding write performance!</p>

<h5 id="do-you-know-what-you-re-looking-for-in-an-sd-card">Do you know what you&rsquo;re looking for in an SD card?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely a great buy. For the money I am very satisfied with my purchase. I think I may share something that a lot of people may not be aware of, since I have informed many family and friends and they said they we unaware and glad I had told them. When shopping for this type of memory card, there are a couple of things on the card to look for. The obvious one being the size of the card, this one being 32gb for instance. It&rsquo;s also extremely useful to know that the very small number with a circle around it is of importance too. This one has a 10 with a circle around it. These cards will have 1-10 on it. The significance is Minimum Serial Data Writing Speed,meaning Class 10 cards have a minimum transfer rate of 10 MB/s. Your card may also display a U with either a I or II in it, signifying the ultra high speed bus (UHS). Now apply this to what you&rsquo;re using this particular card for. I bought it for my trail camera. A class 10 card is used for full HD (1080p) video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills. UHS Class 1 cards are used for real-time broadcasts and recording large HD video files. Other cards would have worked for my trail cam but this one was ideal, and affordable.</p>

<h5 id="16gb-stores-3749-photos-on-16-4mp-camera">16GB stores 3749 photos on 16.4mp camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>16GBWorks great. Using it in a fujifilm xp120 16.4mp camera. The camera I have displays on screen that this card can store 3749 “normal” quality photos. If I change the settings to the “fine” (highest) photo quality it says it can hold 1188 photos. Not bad for under $10. Write speed allows me to take one photo a second just fine, which is pretty much as fast as this camera can take pics. My camera doesn’t have burst mode so I don’t have experience with taking photos that quickly. Would recommend.</p>

<h5 id="great-upgrade-read-write-speed-a-little-slow-in-my-sony-a6300">Great upgrade! Read/Write speed a little slow in my Sony A6300</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A little pricey when I got it, but it was a big step up from by 2gb and 4gb lexar cards. I use this in my Sony A6300 and it works great. There is a little bit of lag when saving after a long video, or a burst of photos that you need to keep in mind. You can keep shooting, but if you need to review the images, you need to wait for the card to finish writing. Next time I need an upgrade, I will buy one that has a faster read/write speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-capacity-for-the-price-no-errors-after-a-year-write-protection-switch-is-fussy">Great capacity for the price, no errors after a year. Write Protection switch is fussy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought for Game console well over a year ago and haven&rsquo;t experienced any failures. Sequential writes are significantly faster than my older 16GB SD card. Random access reads are painfully slow, but you can&rsquo;t beat the capacity for the price. The write protect switch on the side is kinda loose. If you get write errors, double check to make sure the switch is in the fully unlocked position.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-in-my-nintendo-2ds">Works great in my Nintendo 2DS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this to go in my Nintendo 2DS. It did not even require any formatting as it was already formatted correctly. Just had to move the files from the old card over and viola, ready to go!Much faster than the class 4 card that came with the system as well!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using this in my Brinno time lapse camera&hellip;. has been outside in a blizzard (inside a housing) &hellip; indoors&hellip; and everywhere in between and has worked perfectly. SanDisk has been a product that I have never had a problem with over many years of using them&hellip; expect this will be the same and so far&hellip; so good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine">Works fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as extra memory to hold my movies for a laptop I bought with a limited size flash memory hard drive. So far it seems to work fine. I was able to copy my movies over and they seem to play well from this disk. I was fairly happy with the cost of this disk and its performance as extra storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SanDisk is a good brand, I&rsquo;ve been using for many years. This format is also faster than older ones, so no issues on that. I use it to capture video from security camera.</p>
