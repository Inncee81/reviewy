<h5 id="garmin-51-driveluxe">Garmin 51 DriveLuxe</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very hesitant on purchasing the new 51 DriveLuxe LMT-S since I owned and really liked the Nuvi 3597 version. I recently took a 250 mile trip through Illinois and compared the 51 DriveLuxe to my cars 2016 Lexus Enform navigation system side by side. Also compared the 3597 to the new 51 DriveLuxe prior to the trip.First impressions comparing the two units 3597 &amp; 51 DriveLuxe:• DISPLAY: The 3597 wins hands down in visual display. Why Garmin has chosen to change the graphics look of the display is beyond me. See attached picture showing the 3597 on the left. It has more contrast in colors and also shows green when driving in wooded and grass areas where the 51 DriveLuxe looks like a water color painting with no contrast within the colors. It looks like the surrounding areas are all concrete.• VOICE COMMAND: I give the 51 DriveLuxe the edge on this. I recently started using the “Voice Command” features on both the Garmin’s and my cars navigation system. The 51 seems to understand commands slightly better over the 3597. I’m using the voice command function as much as possible, it just makes sense and it works most of the time.• LINKING to iPhone: I have switched to Garmin Smartphone Link live traffic updates over a year ago because of trips to Nashville and found it to be better than built in HD traffic on the 3597. Since the HD traffic cable does not come with the new Garmin it was not a deal breaker. At first I had trouble linking to the new 51 DriveLuxe but blame the fact I had my 3597 linked at the same time. Once I figured out the linking process it connected without issues also I disabled making and receiving phone calls through the Garmin in the Bluetooth settings on the Garmin.• FOURSQUARE and TRIPADVISIOR: Too early to tell if these have any real benefit but currently call them a plus since they come with the unit. If you have a companion with you searching for restaurants or other POI with a smartphone it’s no big deal. I know down loading Foursquare app on my iPhone prove to be another annoying app so I disable notifications.• GPS: It appears the 51 DriveLuxe boots and connects quicker to GPS signals. What is annoying is why Garmin does not publish process speeds and storage capacity of their units. I’m sure a lot of this has to do with how the software is written.• ON SCREEN NOTIFICATIONS: While both units have these the new DriveLuxe has refined it and added a few more touches. Adding, reduced speed, curves are the ones that come to mind and although not necessary they are there and may come in handy.• WiFi UPDATES: No big deal one way or another, no problem connecting to my Wi-Fi but did notice it showed no updates available but when I connected using a cable to Garmin Express it showed map updates available. My thoughts are you still need to be connected to power for long updates why not just use Garmin Express since you have to be cabled anyway.• NAVIGATION: 3597 and DriveLuxe seem to mimic each other.Comparing the Lexus Enform navigation to the DriveLuxe. Both were basically the same as far as navigation except when getting off the interstates. The Garmin’s route guidance seemed to be not as efficient in saving driving time. Obviously the Lexus Enform system display is much better due to its size but also was better at Birdseye view when it came to interstate changes some of which the Garmin did not pickup. These were not critical lane changes but should have been shown. The voice command feature hands down goes to the Garmin. Even after voice training on the Enform navigation I gave up on using it.Conclusion it’s a judgement call between the 3597 and 51 DriveLuxe, both work well and as usual the new version offers some nice updates but overall nothing that really jumps out and makes you feel money well spent. The display is my biggest disappointment.</p>

<p>Wow. There is quite a bit of things packed in this little unit. Love it so far and still have much to learn.</p>

<h5 id="updating-review-after-a-couple-weeks-use-adding-some-stars">Updating Review after a Couple Weeks Use Adding some Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After using this device for a few weeks I have changed my view of this product. I now think it is a great device with lots of functions and enhanced functions when paired with a mobile phone. Really impressed with the way it displays your lanes as you approach exits within a congested area. It steers you to the correct lane and give the audible cues to cut the guesswork. Processor is much faster than the older models. Voice Command quick and responsive. Traffic seems to work but randomly. Not sure what the reason is for that.</p>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Is an excellent buy. But you need to read the instructions, have good features is a great GPS.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it-but-they-ship-it-with-a-cable">I like it, but they ship it with a cable &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it, but they ship it with a cable without a traffic receiver, so I had to order one, since I didn&rsquo;t want to use up my cell data on traffic. functionality of unit good as usual with Garmin.</p>

<p>Works like a GPS should not like the stupid Cell phone apps. No lost signals just when you really need them, like in downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Costs as much as my phone but has none of the impressive features that the Garmin App on my phone has, not even as options. Hopefully Garmin will provide better maps and options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-expected-more-something-entirely-independent-of-my-cell-phone-this-isn-t-it">I expected more, something entirely independent of my cell phone. This isn&rsquo;t it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not planning to return this GPS, but based on the Garmin website advertising I expected more from this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">Do Not Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This GPS depends on data from a iphone / phone and the software used for this is buggy!!! You keep getting a message phone disconnected!!! Very annoying. Would not buy again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="top-of-the-line-accuracy">Top of the line accuracy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this after just totally fed up with Toyota Scout app. Wish Garmin made in dash OEM navigation systems. But until then, Garmin Driveluxe is awesome and very accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-on-the-market">Best on the market.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very Nice GPS. Magnetic mount a real plus. Plug goes into mount not unit so you don&rsquo;t have to remove the plug from the unit and wear out the plug. Great routing.</p>
