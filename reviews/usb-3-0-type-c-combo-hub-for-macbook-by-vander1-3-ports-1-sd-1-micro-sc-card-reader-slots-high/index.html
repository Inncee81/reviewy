<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We just received this USB-C adapter and love it. It sure saves on the dongle wire pull on the plug .Works exactly as explained. Solid build quality and ports work well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-and-useful-for-my-macbook">Nice and useful for my macbook</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This USB Hub makes it and convenient for taking it with you on-the-go.The thing&rsquo;s being held to the side of the computer by a single connection - of course it&rsquo;ll wiggle a little.To sum it does what i needed, to have ability to utilise USB sticks SD etc., this product is very good and highly reccomendable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-actually-bought-two">Great price! Actually bought two</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, this is a well-made hub. I use it to connect my Logitech mouse and my favorite FUGOO speaker to my computer, and it does that job well.Beautiful! it is made out of strong aluminium alloy. I really am happy with this thing. There have been no issues so far. No needs drivers(!!))).Powered - so no issues. Compatible with everything!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought new Mac 2016 and I was shocked to find out that the device I was spending a lot of money on has no damn USB ports! (can&rsquo;t even plug my iphone into it to sync with itunes). Then I found this hub&hellip;and I&rsquo;m almost happy)) I use this mainly for the card reader and 1-2 usb, but it&rsquo;s not bad to have extra usb-c pass-through charging slots.No issues worked as expected. Great buy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-wish-it-had-a-power-port-as-well">I wish it had a power port as well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall for some minor flaws I&rsquo;m a little annoyed. Why, you might ask? It would be badass to have a type c input as well for charging the laptop, maybe instead of the first usb port.Pros: This is a good USB C hub with a decent port selectionCons: Not being able to charge the computer during use of the connectorIn conclusion. Overall it&rsquo;s a good way of expanding your USB 3 slots, especially when it uses a single USB C slot on your macbook/device as not many peripherals have USB C connectors anyways.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-and-beauty-in-one-product">Excellent. Quality and beauty in one product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small and light and fits with the Macbook very well. USB-C also plugs in full depth so it aligns with side side of the Macbook. I can now transfer photos from an SD card whenever. Very good combination and better design than Apples own clunky dongles. I&rsquo;d be unkind to knock a star off as the only drawback is that you you have to be a little careful that the hub remains alongside the laptop because the only attachment is the plug itself. Don&rsquo;t drag the laptop about with this in place, it may disconnect. However, would be difficult to get it to clip firmly against the svelt side of the Macbook shell. In summary, at last a decent port extender that matches the form of the Macbook.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very affordable USB-C hub. I&rsquo;ve only used it a little, but so far it has worked for a monoprice Display-Link USB3 to DP adapter. Also ran two Seagate 2.5&rdquo; USB3 hard-drives simultaneously without the need for extra power, plus a logitech mouse. Very satisfied, especially for the price.Only downside is the lack of pass-through charging, but that&rsquo;s understandable for the intended functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-not-great-but-okay">Okay. Not great, but okay.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a USB C hub with various options. So I&rsquo;m happy I found this one from Vander1. It is built small &amp; sturdy, from high quality metall in a silver color. It&rsquo;s compact &amp; lightweight and transforms a single USB-C Port into 3 highspeed USB 3.0 ports for keyboard, mouse, hard disk etc. Comes with 2 SD Memory Card readers for your MacBook or e.g. a Google Pixel with USB-C - all, in a very small box.Highly recommended product. It is so easy to carry with you. Makes also a nice gift for a friend who is a Apple junkie&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cable-free-hub">Great cable free hub</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this when traveling to add cable free additional storage by putting a 128gb micro SD in the micro SD slot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="effective-and-affordable">Effective and affordable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an affordable alternative to the Apple version. Card readers are a plus as well. Great fix for any new Apple that doesn&rsquo;t have the inputs we all need.</p>

<p>ok unit with design issues that shouldn&rsquo;t exist. When plugged into the larger newer macbook pro there is the potential for a good bit of torque to be placed on the usbc plug since&hellip;</p>

<p>When I have a hard drive running through one of the usb portals and plug something else in, my hard drive ejects itself briefly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-place-to-plug-in-power-source">NO PLACE TO PLUG IN POWER SOURCE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to be working fine in terms of USB ports and SIM cards. But the WORST THING is that I cannot have my power source plugged in at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-well-good-value">Worked well, Good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was expecting some flaws but it&rsquo;s working perfectly, good price for a multi usb hub. The USB ports are all 3.</p>
