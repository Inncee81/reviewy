<h5 id="great-pump-even-better-if-you-change-the-pump-seal-see-picture">Great pump&hellip;even BETTER if you change the pump seal. See picture.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best sprayer I&rsquo;ve used, and I&rsquo;ve gone through many.Word to the wise, if you use vinegar and dish soap instead of the expensive store bought weed killer, don&rsquo;t leave the pump immersed in it for long periods of time. I did exactly that and it caused the bottom seal of the pump mechanism to shrivel up and lose the ability to seal.I bought the &ldquo;Roundup 182349 Universal Lawn and Garden Sprayer Repair Kit with O-Rings, Seals and Gaskets&rdquo; for $4 on Amazon to fix it. In fact, after I installed the seal from Roundup, the pump worked better than the day it was new. With the 3 gallon tank about 90% empty (meaning a lot of room for air), about 10 pumps is all it took to fill it up with air! Even when this was new, I had to pump it 20-30X to get it full of air.For the price you can&rsquo;t beat it! I&rsquo;ve own three other tanks prior to this, one being an expensive backpack type, and none lasted more than one season of 1-2 month usage. Even the $150 backpack tank failed after three months&hellip;and with no rebuild kit available, it went in the garbage.</p>

<h5 id="original-problem-solved-sprayer-now-is-a-winner">Original problem solved. Sprayer now is a winner.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>ORIGINAL REVIEW - UPDATE IS BELOWThis should have been a five star review. Unfortunately, there was a significant problem with my sprayer.After trying other sprayers I thought I had found &ldquo;the one&rdquo;. Specific features I wanted were a discrete overpressure relief valve and seals resistant to most chemicals. Got them, good. What I didn&rsquo;t get was unexpected. I didn&rsquo;t get a sprayer that pumped up well ,or at all, right out of the box.After contacting e-mailing the manufacturer and getting ZERO response I decided to investigate. I found the large o-ring surrounding the pump piston to be too small to get a good seal during pumping. This could be due to (a) The groove the o-ring is in is too deep or (b) the o-ring used was not thick enough. In order to get it to pump I had to put an expander behind the o-ring to increase it&rsquo;s diameter. I used several turns of another Viton o-ring as the expander. So now it works but only by using a work-around and with no help from the manufacturer.UPDATE: After writing the above review I was contacted by the manufacturer who immediately sent me a new pump assembly. The manufacturer admitted that my original pump may have been shipped with the wrong size o-ring. So, to be fair, I think the problem I experienced is unusual and should not take away from what is otherwise a fine sprayer. I think 5 stars is now in order.</p>

<h5 id="quality-and-performance">Quality and Performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually I am kind of proud of myself for getting this Smith Max Contractor sprayer. I have had four sprayers over the last 20 years of gardening and landscape uses. My current need was to spray seal my concrete driveway. I choose the Smith because it gives me a choice of four spray heads. Adjustable won&rsquo;t do it, I wanted a high volume fan spray pattern. Now I have it. But I am totally impressed with the quality and design of this unit. It appears very durable, not cheaply made at all. And one must rate these sprayers by the number of pumps and stroke length to pressurize the tank. This unit is a short stroke and very quickly pressurizes the tank (the pump unit inside the tank is longer than most for this purpose). The shape, well, it is easier to stay upright, as to move around. I will not be lending this unit to my neighbors, they may use the old one. Finally, included is a 45 deg angle nozzle coupling. It gives a variety of comfortable wand positions and e.g. when spraying downward, say on ground or driveway, the spray is perpendicular to the surface, a real plus. Similar for spraying higher up like tall roses and shrubs. I&rsquo;d buy it again.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-sprayer-i-ve-used-bar-none">The best sprayer I&rsquo;ve used bar none</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used (and discarded) a number of sprayers over the years. I started with the dirt cheap ones, and they tended to last about a season or two at best even when well cared for. They didn&rsquo;t work well even when they did work, however.So, I upgraded to the &ldquo;better&rdquo; ones at the big box stores. Those lasted longer, but still didn&rsquo;t function all that well.So I thought I&rsquo;d step up to the DB Smith &ldquo;Professional&rdquo; model, having read the good reviews. I am just floored by how well this is put together! All the parts and pieces are sturdy; the pump action is smooth; and everything works perfectly.It also has a number of convenience features such as a clip to hold the spray wand in storage, and a cap at the base that catches any dribbles from the nozzle when it&rsquo;s not in use. The control lever is comfortable to use and has an on latch that flips on or off easily. It has a pressure release knob to quickly bleed off the pressure after you&rsquo;re done. It comes with a shoulder strap, and the main body is translucent so you can see the fluid level easily.It comes with a collection of tips including a foaming nozzle, a fan nozzle, and an adjustable cone nozzle. The manual is nicely detailed with tips and photos on maintenance.Icing on the cake: it&rsquo;s made in the USA.They make a similar model called the &ldquo;O&rdquo; style which has straight sides to the tank. This model (they call it the &ldquo;R&rdquo; style) is teardrop shaped. It offers more stability since it has a lower center of gravity, plus it has the cap at the base I mentioned earlier, which the O style lacks. But, according to the manual, the guts are the same for both styles. The only difference is the shape.I can&rsquo;t speak to the longevity of this since I&rsquo;ve only used it a few times, but it seems like I&rsquo;ll be able to get several years out of it. I&rsquo;ll update the review as needed should problems occur.They also make a 3 gal. version. I went with the 2 gal one since I already have a 3 gal sprayer that is working well. But, should that die on me, I&rsquo;ll certainly replace it with another DB Smith.Highly recommend!UPDATE June 2017: Still going strong. Zero problems and everything (including the seals) has held up very well.</p>

<h5 id="won-t-build-pressure">Won&rsquo;t Build Pressure&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although this sprayer appeared to initially work, now the unit won&rsquo;t build pressure. I&rsquo;ve applied a liberal amount of petroleum jelly to the piston, but still no good. The piston o-ring appears to be under sized. I attempted to submit a question on their website, but the website form submission reported errors&hellip;ugh. I&rsquo;ll have to try to find the appropriate o-ring, or toss this thing out.</p>
