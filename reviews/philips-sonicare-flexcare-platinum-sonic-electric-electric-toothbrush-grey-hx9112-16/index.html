<h5 id="initial-great-performance-marred-by-slow-company-support">Initial Great Performance Marred by Slow Company Support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated on 5/12/2016After no contact for about a month, I did receive an email stating that a replacement was being shipped. I&rsquo;ve upgraded my rating reflecting this. Having gone weeks without any acknowledgement, I did purchase a replacement, another Sonicare (similar model). Now, I&rsquo;ll have a backup.When first delivered, this unit worked very well and I was quite pleased with it. But after about 6 months, it started increasing in volume and decreasing in brushing intensity. This model can detect when the user is brushing too hard, and it seemed like something broke causing it to act as through it was always under excessive load. Contacting Sonicare, the tech I talked to on the phone agreed that it seemed to have a problem. I was asked to send the vendor invoice info (from amazon) which I did. Weeks have passed and no follow-up from Philips Sonicare.This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I&rsquo;ve purchased. The first lasted several years before the linear motor deteriorated. That seemed like a reasonable life expectancy. But this new brush had a two year warranty and Philips doesn&rsquo;t seem to be interested in keeping their customers happy.</p>

<h5 id="i-took-pretty-good-care-of-it-since-i-had-it-but-the-battery-is-beginning-to-die">I took pretty good care of it since I had it but the battery is beginning to die</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it clean your teeth well? You bet it does but is it a product that you will have for awhile? Probably not. Mine is actually starting to fail at this point. I took pretty good care of it since I had it and only charge it when it ran out of juice. It needed charging almost every two weeks when I got it. Now, it needs charging after every use. This is my 3rd electrical tooth brush and my first from Sonicare but I am going back to manual brushing. Way too expensive of a brush like this that is failing less than a year of use. Planned obsolescence</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="oral-b-vs-sonicare">Oral B vs. Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a long time Oral B user, I really debated whether to stick with Oral B or try something new. But after reading the reviews of the Oral B, I was turned off by complaints about the bright blue charging light and also did not like the charger being so huge (I don&rsquo;t need multiple brush heads on display nor do I care about a big timer or app!)My immediate, out-of-the-box impression with the Sonicare was that I made a mistake&ndash; it felt cheaper, more plasticky. And the travel case it comes with is so cheap and poorly made that it really made me think about returning everything (when will manufacturers realize we just want a tiny travel case, not one to accomodate multiple brushes?!).But what really mattered was the quality of the cleaning and, wow, it was a huge difference&ndash; night and day. It does take some getting use to&ndash; the vibration cleaning as opposed to the Oral B&rsquo;s mechanical cleaning&ndash; but it make my teeth feel like I just got a professional cleaning. Amazing difference. And what felt a bit cheaper out-of-the box&ndash; the more lightweight plastic feel&ndash; is actually a plus now, I like it being not as heavy as the Oral B.My only real gripe is that the buttons are too flush and that their placement often leads me to accidentally turn it it off mid-brush.That said, I&rsquo;m very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dirty-mouth-clean-it-up">Dirty mouth? Clean it up!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this as an upgrade when an older Sonicare that I have had for 6 years began to pass away. I have sworn by these things since I first started using them. As far as this model goes, I like it, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel as solid in my hand as my other one did. Normally, consumers enjoy lighter products as things evolve, but when it comes to a toothbrush, I like to have a little weight so that it doesn&rsquo;t slip from my hands. Once you get used to that, it&rsquo;s fine&hellip;just something that irked me a bit.I won&rsquo;t go into the different modes, as there is plenty of information about that, but I do like the options. It&rsquo;s really just timing&hellip;the modes do do anything different from each other.I deducted a star because of the price. I can&rsquo;t see where this model is any better than the lesser model. I did get it on sale and with a coupon, which brought the price down, but I think it&rsquo;s still a bit overpriced.Since I started using these things, my dentist routinely remarks how clean my teeth are when I go for my semi-annual visits.The included carry case is very nice. I had a cloth one with my last brush, and when I traveled and the wet brush had to be in there for the trip home, it generally smelled sour by the time I got home. This plastic case seems to solve that.All in all, a great toothbrush, and I will definitely be sticking with this line!</p>

<h5 id="sonicare-worth-the-money-and-it-delivers-what-it-says-it-will-do">Sonicare&ndash;Worth the Money, and it Delivers What It Says It Will Do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave it four stars, (instead of 5), because when spending upwards of $150.00 for a toothbrush, (including some discounts), I&rsquo;d expect it to completely whiten teeth, then correct years of periodontal disease overnight, (so we&rsquo;d all look like the young models on TV)&ndash;however it doesn&rsquo;t, but I feel I&rsquo;m on my way.The Sonicare is a serious product in the field of dental care&ndash;you can feel its power the first time you use it. For example, if you don&rsquo;t hold it exactly as instructed, and the handle should touch your teeth, you can rattle your whole mouth in an eye-opening way. It really pays to read the instructions before using the product in order to get the maximum benefit.You DO feel like you are giving your mouth a work-out and your teeth are completely cleaned each time you use it. The design is such that it is easy to reach everywhere to get all the hidden spots. When reading about the different models before ordering, I was a bit concerned that the features seemed relatively complicated, what with all the &ldquo;modes&rdquo; and intensities, and I was afraid I&rsquo;d only use a couple of the features, but the unit is extremely well designed, and its use is intuitive and easy.The Sonicare has the feel of a quality instrument in your hands, and the materials and workmanship make it worth what you pay. A lot of thought and effort was put into the product, (there is a built-in timer), so you quickly learn how long to stay in each area, and when you&rsquo;re finished, you feel confident that the best possible cleaning has been done,Easy to use, easy to reach &ldquo;hard&rdquo; places, and you will use all the features and appreciate the quality.Duane</p>
