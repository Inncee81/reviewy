<h5 id="i-love-this-tablet">I love this tablet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this tablet. I was looking for a cheap tablet to use outside, in the shop, and while traveling that was inexpensive so if I accidentally broke it I wouldn&rsquo;t be as heart-broken. This one fits the bill perfect. While it was a cheaper PC/Tablet it definitely is not cheaply made. Made of a hard durable plastic material. The screen is not the cheap plastic screen I was expecting, it is actually a quality screen. Flawless version of Windows 10. Couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Everything is working perfect. I would have felt I got my money&rsquo;s worth if I had to pay twice this cost. Highly recommended if you have children that need a PC or tablet or if you need a durable inexpensive tablet to use in a shop environment or outside. This one is great for it all. Been using it for a few months so far and it still runs like a champ.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-lasts-longer-than-30-days">It lasts longer than 30 Days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; Tablet expert at this point. I began trying to purchase Windows Tablets as Xmas presents and for personal use in August of 2015. To date, I purchased ELEVEN Windows Tablets. I returned EIGHT of those Windows tablets before buying two excellent RCA Windows Tablets. They do what the others could not&ndash;THEY WORK! Although others tried and failed, this tablet lives up to its hype. Ease of use, excellent screen resolution, tons of productivity, loads of storage, lightening quick response, durable, portable, expandable, plus full sized and micro USB ports. Connected to my Home Network via Bluetooth, I can print and share with ease. The HDMI port expands usability with other devices.</p>

<h5 id="good-value-for-the-price">Good value for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;netbook&rdquo; style windows 10 computer with a detachable and reversible keyboard is a very good value. Though not a big processor, it is fast enough for all the basics computer needs: word processing, spreadsheets, web surfing and basic games (though &ldquo;RPG&rdquo; and other heavy duty games probably would suffer some lag). You could do video editing on this machine but it would be a bit slow going - however, you probably didn&rsquo;t buy it for that reason!Screen is decent at 10.1; it is as big as most windows and android tablets. Weight is comfortable (even with the keyboard attached). and it allows you to bring your work with you to the office without lugging a heavy notebook computer.It does not have a big battery capacity so don&rsquo;t expect 9 hours from it, best would be around 3 to 5 hours depending on the tasks and energy saving configurations. There is only one speaker so stereo is out unless you use a headset (either wired, USB or Bluetooth). It has a plethora of connection: mini-HDMI, Full and Micro size USB, and Headset. It is unique in that it can be powered or charged with either the dedicated A/C adapter (included) or through the micro USB port.The other nice feature is the detachable keyboard. You can put it on in two configurations, regular &ldquo;clam shell&rdquo; to work like a small notebook or reversed to create a &ldquo;tent&rdquo; to view the screen or to use as a tablet stand. This is a useful feature and not found in similar priced 2-in-1&rsquo;s. There are forward and back cameras though I have never liked them being place on the the landscape orientations left side middle as opposed to the top middle in landscape mode.And then there is the price! A fully implemented Windows 10 tablet with a detachable, functional keyboard under $130.00 - nothing else at this price range and quality!Yes, recommended with just two considerations - the battery is not nearly enough so keep a charging cord (either the A/C adapter or micro USB) on hand for long time use and don&rsquo;t expect to listen to stereo without a headset of some kind. Beyond those minor concerns this is a solid hit for RCA in the tablet / 2-in-1 category!</p>

<h5 id="pleasantly-amazed">Pleasantly Amazed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this tab/laptop!!! It was much better than I expected. I have had a few Samsung tablets for a few years now, I have to say I love the RCA so much more! There is so much you can do with it. I also love the USB port, the mini hdmi port, and it works so well with my bluetooth headsets. I hope that it still works as well in a year. I&rsquo;m planning on buying three more&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-computer">Really nice computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This device is terrific! It was easy to set up. It&rsquo;s fast. Great images. My husband and I use computers mainly to browse the internet or watch Netflix. He is just starting to even delve into computers so I looked for something easy to start with. The price is fantastic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="versatility">versatility</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the versatility of this little laptop/tablet. It is so convenient to be able to detach the screen and use as a tablet or turn it around to use as a stand. It is the perfect size for a tablet, not too small or too large. I have a compartment in my purse padded to accommodate a tablet. I thought it would be too large to fit, but it fits perfectly. I love that it is Windows so I can load any software and use it just like a pc. Cons: the keyboard is small, large hands may have difficulty. Also the battery runs down if I don&rsquo;t turn it off or keep it plugged in. It lasts about 3 hours without power. Its biggest problem is that if you let it run completely down, you may not be able to get it to turn back on. When this happens you either have to leave it plugged in and off for about an hour or plug it into another computer to charge. As long as you do this it works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-job-rca">Nice job RCA.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had one other windows type tablet, a Toshiba that was total junk. This unit has exceeded ALL my expectations. It does everything the write up says and more. Between 2 GB of active RAM and 32 GB on board storage, you can get by fine. Then add a 64 GB micro SD card (boy, have they gotten cheap) and you&rsquo;re well covered. It&rsquo;s not for gamers, but if you&rsquo;re a gamer you already knew that. It&rsquo;s great for surfing , basic stuff and runs apps like Hulu, HBO Now and Netflix without a hitch. I use it for books for both Kindle and Nook. As long as it keeps running like this I&rsquo;ll be a happy camper. BTW with Windows 10 Home for an OS I don&rsquo;t think you can do much better. It&rsquo;s beautifully lightweight and sure beats ligging my Lenovo laptop around.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-purchase-it-does-everything-i-do-online">This is a great purchase. It does everything i do online</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great purchase. It does everything i do online. It has plenty of internal memory, with a slot for a micro sd card for even more expandable memory. HDMI. and standard usb and micro usb. detachable keyboard, and earphone slot. Look&hellip;at this price, you can not beat this deal.</p>

<p>Quit working at two months. I think it charges, but it just won&rsquo;t turn on. Apparently this is a common problem with RCA tablet.</p>
