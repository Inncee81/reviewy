<h5 id="good-value-for-money-but-spare-backdoor-is-not-waterproof">Good value for money but spare backdoor is NOT waterproof</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I almost give this product a 1 Star review due to an unfortunate mistake on my part caused by something I think is stupid in the bundle that came with the camera.Here&rsquo;s my story:I purchased this camera for a trip in the Pacific. The camera worked great and I am pleased with the results for a &lt; $100 purchase. I mainly used the camera for underwater shots while snorkeling. But one afternoon while getting ready for a swim, we were being pestered by bugs, so my wife sprayed insect repellent on my arms and legs. There was a pool of liquid on one leg which I rubbed in. However, the spray contained DEET. And I then touched the back of the waterproof case which has made a mess of the backdoor. I DID NOT KNOW THAT DEET EATS PLASTIC! You have been warned. But I was not concerned since I knew there was a spare back in the accessories. What I did not realize was that the spare back IS NOT WATERPROOF! Why on earth does the manufacturer supply a second back for the waterproof case that is not waterproof? Upon my return to the US, I went to use the camera in my pool with the non-waterproof back and guess what - the camera got wet, the screen went white, and I thought I had ruined the camera leaving me with a bag of bits that I would never use again. However, I quickly removed camera from the case, removed the battery and memory card, put camera into a bag of rice and left in a warm place for 48 hours. I am happy to report that the camera appears to be working just fine - only time will tell. But I re-iterate - why would someone supply a spare back for a waterproof housing that made the housing non-waterproof?So two warnings here:Stay way from insecticides that contain DEETThe spare backdoor for the housing is not waterproof.</p>

<h5 id="great-deal-but-some-quirks">Great deal! But some quirks.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great deal for a great little camera! Bought this for taking pictures in / under the water for a trip to the Philippines and didnt feel like spending hundreds. It certainly has some quirks and a learning curve, but it works great and definitely can&rsquo;t beat the price! Photo quality is great, would give 4 stars for some of the quirks but gets a bonus star for the great price!Some notes:- Takes a little time to figure out how to use it since there aren&rsquo;t many instructions provided. For example, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to open the underwater case and I was afraid of breaking it! See my photos here for help on that.- App recommended in provided instructions didn&rsquo;t work for me, but another one called PNJ iCam (iOS) works perfectly. So far I have just downloaded and deleted and taken pictures through the app.- Photos and videos sometimes show up out of order on the app, which can make it hard to figure out which ones you have already downloaded vs. which are new.- WiFi functionality for this is similar to what other things like headsets or speakers use Bluetooth for, but since it connects over WiFi, you will not be connected to other WiFi networks during that time.- When in the underwater casing, it doesn&rsquo;t quite line up so you get a little black on the edge of the frame where the casing blocks the lens. Slight annoyance as you can crop it out of the photos. Need to figure out how to crop my videos.</p>

<h5 id="updated-a-solid-month-of-hard-use-after-2-video-reviews-the-verdict-is-in-all-good">UPDATED: A solid month of hard use. After 2 video reviews the verdict is in. ALL GOOD!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price you should not be allowed to complain. I have been shooting with this camera all weekend and love it. It comes with a ton of accessories, and the quality is just about as good as the Gopro costing more than 4 times as much. It is easy to operate and has a LCD screen on its back. It feels sturdy and did not break when I dropped it&hellip; only once. Sound is just ok but that really is not what these action camera are for. If you want to see the quality of both photo and video, check out the video I made. I definitely recommend this camera. To see the video type in, &ldquo;photojunky drone zone&rdquo; , and there is a full review with a lot of footage.UPDATED: I have shot with this camera over a month and have made several videos. My final conclusion is&hellip; Gopro has set the standard, so most people use the quality of the Gopro as a measuring stick. This camera although good and incredible for the price is not as good in some aspects when compared to the Gopro. The image is more contrasty than the Gopro so in shadows you lose some detail. The colors seem a bit saturated and produce a less realistic image. This can be changed with an editor if you really need to, but not the loss of shadow detail. Build quality is good especially when you take into account the price. and the LCD screen on the back makes everything a lot easier such as settings and actually being able to see what you are filming. After a month of hard use I definitely recommend this camera. If you want to see a side by side comparison, go to youtube and seach &ldquo;Photojunky Drone Zone&rdquo; . There you will see two video reviews.</p>

<h5 id="run-away">Run away!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, I read the reviews warning about the wierd 4K frame rate. That was ok I wasn&rsquo;t looking for 4K. I put a 128GB NAME BRAND card that spent two years in a Galaxy Tab S2. Let&rsquo;s talk 1080 though.., 1080 60fps recording it drops recording video and image freezes while still recording audio. Ok, switch to 1080 30fps &hellip;. Better BUT! Today I went out and recorded 6 videos. Because the wireless app doesn&rsquo;t work with Samsung Galaxy S8+ with Qualcomm CPU. I removed the card after turning camera off. One video and only was playable, all others were corrupt. The wireless app btw did work on my retired Galaxy S6 edge(nougat), a retired S4(lollipop) and my Galaxy Tab S2 (Nougat, currently with a 256GB card).I tried, I really tried for a couple of days to get this to work. It simply does not deliver as advertised.</p>
