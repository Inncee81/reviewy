The Ultimate Wi-Fi Controlled Quadricopter
Easily controlled by Wi-Fi using a smartphone or tablet, the latest Parrot AR. Drone 2.0 Elite Edition collection offers enthusiasts a choice of three classic camouflaged styles: sand, snow or jungle. Inspired by desert, arctic and rain forest landscapes. Each individual product is supplied attractively packaged in its own specially designed printed carton with a distinctive indoor and outdoor hull, plus one pair of black propellers and another customized pair of propellers to compliment the color scheme. The exclusive Elite Edition packaging includes one 1000mAh lithium polymer battery to provide up to twelve minutes of flying time, plus a convenient battery charger with international adapters. Featuring a high definition camera with a video recording facility, plus flight data sharing, a patented piloting mode, and an innovative pressure sensor for increased stability at any altitude, Parrot&rsquo;s amazing AR. Drone 2.0 Elite Edition quadricopter can even perform four axis flips on command.</p>

<p>AR. Freeflight
AR. FreeFlight is the primary application used to fly and pilot the AR. Drone 2.0. Use your smartphone or tablet to fly the AR. Drone 2.0, with or without the accelerometer, and switch from the frontal camera to the vertical camera.</p>

<p>Director Mode*
The Director mode lets you program automatic movements so that you can shoot great videos just like a movie director. The new AR. Drone 2.0 firmware will eliminate most of the hiccups due to light wind conditions or sudden stop to deliver the smoothest video you&rsquo;ll ever shot with an AR. Drone 2.0. The settings menu lets you fine tune exposure, color saturation, and white balance or choose from an array of presets to quickly find the setting that will fit your needs. *In-app purchase on ar. freeflight</p>

HD 720p Camera
The AR. Drone 2.0 is equipped with a high definition front camera that will let the pilot view exactly what the AR. Drone 2.0 sees, just as if they were in the pilot seat. Download the free AR. FreeFlight application (available on the App Store and Google play) and take control of the AR. Drone 2.0 in just seconds. The user-friendly control interface will appear over the video feedback streamed straight from the AR. Drone 2.0 with no latency, thanks to its self-generated Wi-Fi network. The automatic stabilization system of the AR. Drone 2.0 will ensure an image of high quality indoors, or outdoors even in light wind conditions. Whether using a smartphone or a tablet, the pilot will see a clean, crystal clear image straight from the sky.</p>

Absolute Control Piloting Mode
A brand new and exclusive piloting mode, patented by Parrot for the AR. Drone 2.0. The Absolute Control piloting mode makes life much easier for beginners, by only using your device position as a point of reference. The result is simple, regardless of which direction the front of the AR. Drone 2. 0 is facing, you just have to tilt your smartphone in any direction to see the AR. Drone 2.0 fly towards it. A beginner can now become an expert pilot in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>View larger
Record Directly on Your Device
AR. FreeFlight lets the pilot record video and pictures while flying the AR. Drone 2.0. Simply press the record button to start and end the recording, and use the dedicated photo/video section of the application to watch what you&rsquo;ve shot immediately after you have landed. No cables, SD card or PC required. Everything has already been pre-programmed in your smartphone/tablet, so that can watch your performance instantly.</p>

<p>View larger
Higher &amp; Faster
The AR. Drone 2.0 offers unique stability, thanks to its embedded sensors and navigation system. Any movement not solicited by the pilot will be automatically corrected by the AR. Drone 2.0 to maintain a perfectly still position in the air, while you are not controlling it. Push it, fly it in windy conditions (up to 15 m/h), and it won&rsquo;t move an inch until you decide to make it move. Thanks to its new pressure sensors, the AR. Drone 2.0 will provide this automatic stability even further, by making sure it remains stable whatever the altitude.</p>

<p>View larger
Record &amp; Share on USB
For users wishing to shoot longer videos, without using their smartphone/tablet memory, a USB plug is located inside the AR. Drone 2.0 for easy USB recording. Shoot as much footage as you want, and share easily on YouTube or Picasa when finished, thanks to the embedded options of the application.</p>

<p>View larger
The Flip
A unique acrobatic move specifically designed for the AR. Drone 2.0. Press a button to perform an impressive forward or backward flip, or barrel roll as you are flying. The embedded navigation system of the AR. Drone 2.0 will automatically recover, enabling any new pilot to enjoy this move.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="probably-the-second-best-drone-on-the-market-would-be-5-stars-except-for-a-few-shortcomings">Probably the second best drone on the market. Would be 5 stars except for a few shortcomings.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This can be found on Amazon for $300Ok, I own one of these as well as a DJI Phantom. The Phantom is the best drone ever made and some of the best money I ever spent. However, the Phantom v1 with built-in camera costs $500, which is $200 more than the Parrot. The basic model Phantom is $400, but you need to have a GoPro camera to take video.What this drone does good:It is simple to fly and pretty stable. I&rsquo;ve taken it out in 15mph winds and it handled fine. Anyone can fly it without experience, and after a few hours of flight time you will be a master. The camera takes decent video which streams to your phone or tablet real-time and the video is automatically saved to your photos. It is pretty rugged and can hold up to some crashes. At $300 it comes with everything you need to fly, and it is ready to go right out of the box.So, why only 4 stars? The main drawback is the control system. It connects to your phone or tablet via WiFi. In other words, the Parrot creates its own WiFi network, and when you connect to that WiFi network you can then use the app to fly the drone. There are two problems with this: First, it only has the range of a WiFi network, which means that at best you can only fly it around 35 yards away from you before the signal gets weak. Compare that to the average standard 2.4ghz R/C transmitter (like the Phantom uses) which has a range of about a mile. Second, since you use the phone as a control, you control it using the touch screen. If you have ever played a FPS or other type of video game on a touch screen you know how much less sensitive it is than using joysticks (i.e. like the joysticks on your PlayStation or XBox remote). You can also use motion control to fly the Parrot. This means when you hold down a &ldquo;button&rdquo; on the app, it will move in the way you tilt your phone. Tilt your phone left and it flies left, tilt it forward and the Parrot flies forward. This works really well, as well as it possibly could- but it&rsquo;s STILL not as sensitive as a joystick would be. If they gave you the option to use a transmitter to control it rather than just your phone, this would be a 5 star product.So now I will talk about it compared to the Phantom: the Phantom is more stable, more powerful and faster, can fly farther, and is easier to control. I have taken the Phantom to the edge of the legal flying height for R/C vehicles (400 feet), I have made it zip around at 20 meters per second (45 mph) and with the GoPro3 it takes insanely good HD video and photos. However, the Phantom v1 with a built-in camera is $500, and the basic model (which I bought for $400) needs a GoPro to take video.So my final verdict is this:If you already have a GoPro- it&rsquo;s a no-brainer. Get the Phantom. The extra $50-$100 is TOTALLY worth it. Same if you want a drone and don&rsquo;t care about recording video.If you don&rsquo;t have a GoPro and don&rsquo;t mind spending around $500, get the Phantom.If you don&rsquo;t want to spend any more than $300 because of your budget, or because you want a drone but don&rsquo;t want to spend more than $300 for what is essentially a toy, get this.It is worth the price, and you will have tons of fun with it.TIP: Buy an extra battery. Each battery has approximately 10 minutes of flying time and takes about 1 hour to charge.</p>

<h5 id="i-was-really-hoping-to-like-this-a-lot-more">I was really hoping to like this a lot more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really hoping to like this a lot more.It&rsquo;s definitely quite finicky to connect with the app - I often have to reset my Nexus 5 and the ARDrone before the app lets me connect, even though I&rsquo;ve connected to the ARDrone WiFi network and checked I have the right IP.I&rsquo;ve also realized that, while controlling with the app is pretty simple once you know what you&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s not as accurate as stick/throttle combo.My biggest bugbear is the fixed camera, which I knew was there but didn&rsquo;t realize how much more fun this would be if it had a gimbal camera.All these points I knew about before I bought the drone, but it&rsquo;s just not as exciting as I had hoped it would be.</p>

<h5 id="quality-control-could-be-better">Quality control could be better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one i received flew fine, but when I tried to record video in flight the quality of video was terrible; fully of wavy interference to the point of being completely useless. Researched this and found the problem is due to vibration from props being out of balance. Returned it to Amazon, they quickly shipped another one. This one had satisfactory video in flight but when I hooked up a thumb drive for recording, it would function intermittently and stop recording on its own mid-flight and a message would appear,&ldquo;USB drive disconnected, recording stopped.&rdquo; Tried other drives, didn&rsquo;t work, problem was in the unit. Then I hooked up the flight recorder/GPS (from parrot) and it recorded to that drive without a problem. Both times the boxes delivered were dented, re-taped, and looked like then had either been abused or mailed and returned multiple times. The shipping box is also quite flimsy. The GPS/Flight recorder option is a lot of fun. Controls are easy but WiFi limits distance. Overall I&rsquo;m satisfied but not delighted. If you order one, don&rsquo;t be too surprised if you have to return it. Amazon has always been great on returns. I wouldn&rsquo;t order it from anywhere else as their return policy may not be so accommodating.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-fun-although-camera-quality-battery-life-aren-t-great">Fantastic fun, although camera quality, battery life aren&rsquo;t great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had such a blast taking this thing out. My only complaint is that the standard battery doesn&rsquo;t last longer than 15 minutes.I bought a replacement, 1500mAh battery to extend the life of the drone. I am experimenting with mounting iPhones and GoPros on the drone, and the shots are unbelievable. Shots that would&rsquo;ve once taken the budget of a Hollywood film can now be done by a geek like me in his gym shorts.One note: The stock cameras are not great. If you&rsquo;re serious about filmmaking, they&rsquo;re not to be used. The downward facing camera is almost useless for recording.</p>
