<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-nice-hood-but-lousy-lighting">Very nice hood, but lousy lighting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This hood has a very clean design and look and the price is very affordable. I have it vented out through my roof, and the fan seems to perform very well. It has removable traps which is a nice feature. I am very un-happy with the lighting. You get two dim blue led bulbs that are installed at the very back of the unit. I have led lights throughout my house that I am happy with. For one these do not throw enough light and for two they are mounted at the rear of the fixture. This is over my stove, the primary preparation surface for food, I want to see what I am doing. These need to be about 3x more powerful and placed in the front of the hood or in the middle so they throw light over the area you are working under. You can replace the bulbs but the instructions say specifically not to increase the wattage. I might try to anyway because I am very unhappy with the light this unit provides.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beeping-is-loud">Beeping is loud</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The looks and quality of build is above expectation. The biggest complaint is when taping the buttons for lights, timer, and speed, there is a beeping noise that is very loud. I would say louder than to be expected. After install, I could hear the beep from outside my home. It&rsquo;s the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5. Everything else: look, quality of material, ease of use: was nice and to be expected. I did notice that the LED lights were positioned at the back of the stove, and were not as bright as I expected. As most LED lights go, they are a blue tint, and the rest of my kitchen uses warm bulbs, so the lighting colors are different. Install was fairly easy, the electric is a plug, not open wires, which was designed for a plug and play ease of use. We had to pay someone to install and it took about 1-2 hours.We were told the anchors that were provided were not good quality and slipped out during install which had to be replaced. Could you DIY? I watch the whole thing, and I&rsquo;d say if your a bit handy and feel comfortable with drilling into a wall, and perhaps had an extra hand during positioning anchoring, it can be done DIY. Get some stainless steel polish, You&rsquo;ll want that after install with the finger prints you will make during install.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-unit-at-a-great-price">Awesome Unit at a great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unit is exactly as described. Looks fantastic. It is the focal point of our kitchen and we have already gotten many comments on how great it looks. My install was a little rough, but that had nothing to do with the unit. We were going from an under cabinet mounted one that vented out the back. I know you can make this one ventless/ductless with the filters, but from the research I did everyone said if you can vent it outside your house that is the way to go (plus the cost of filters over time add up). Although when I asked the seller if the unit could be vented out a wall as opposed to up through the ceiling, they said &ldquo;no, only can be vented up&rdquo; I was able to vent it through the wall by redoing some of my existing ductwork. Instead of using the flexible 6&rdquo; exhaust tubing that came with the unit, I put an elbow directly on top of the unit and vented it right into the wall and out (I will try to post some pictures). One tip when installing, make a template of the back of the unit with paper or cardboard to help with locating where to drill holes. The instructions aren&rsquo;t great, but like many have said it&rsquo;s pretty self explanatory once you start putting it together. I would recommend an extra set of hands for the job. All in all the unit looks and works great and is a fraction of the price you would pay if you walked in any home improvement store! For a nice added touch we added a stainless steal sheet underneath as well as a stainless shelf.</p>

<h5 id="installation-was-pretty-straight-forward">Installation was pretty straight forward</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installation was pretty straight forward. Took me about 3 hours with no help (recommend having someone to help hang it but it&rsquo;s manageable). Fit and finish is nice. Comments about the lights being on the dim side are correct but I have high hats over the range anyway so not a big deal. As far as others complaining about noise; I purchased this to replace a Broan unit I had that sounded like a Bell UH-1 starting up its rotors. This thing is very quiet comparatively to that one. My unit is vented through the roof so it does extremely well on clearing steam, smells, etc; not sure why others have mentioned it doesn&rsquo;t work for them but maybe it&rsquo;s b/c they&rsquo;re using the non-vented charcoal filtered version. Also worth noting for those that mentioned that it didn&rsquo;t line up on the corners you have to have patience and take your time to align the steel vent stack to the unit. Also cannot figure out how anyone is saying the unit has become dented? Again, take your time hanging the unit and you will have no issues. The beeping of the panel is no more louder than any standard microwave keypad. Well Worth the price; and if you&rsquo;re looking for value with a nice finish this is the fan for you.</p>

<h5 id="highly-suggest-most-may-need-professional-installer">Highly Suggest! Most May Need Professional Installer:</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Incredible value. Looks stunning! Everyone who sees it thinks it cost quadrupile the price! We have a 10&rsquo; celing and had to go to the AKDY website and buy a hood extension for the stack to reach the ceiling. This cost an additional $65 - no shipping - which is also a great price. If you aren&rsquo;t EXTREMELY handy you will not be able to install this yourself. A couple of problems we ran into when installing: If you are installing over tile you will need to drill through the tiles to mount and will need a drill/proper drill bits not to crack them. The size of our chimney hose was larger in diameter than the products and we had to buy a hose transition piece, clamp, and flu tape to connect the two which cost about $30 all together. If you are looking to have the flu reach the ceiling you may need the extension and the right size and finish is only available through the manufacturer. If you have a 10&rsquo; ceiling and don&rsquo;t want three seams showing on the flu you may need to do some fabrication which requires very precise measurements before hanging and some fabrication of the product and the additional extension (drilling custom holes through the initial product piece and the additional extension piece to connect them which requires a drill and screws/bolts).</p>

<h5 id="ok-while-it-works">OK while it works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This hood worked fine and was easy to install. It is rather cheap and broke exactly after a year. We filled out the customer service form online but no-one has reached out to us&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="our-customers-have-loved-the-modern-design">Our Customers have loved the modern design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We use this in many of our home remodels. Our Customers have loved the modern design, it works perfectly every time and you can not beat the price for the quality that is&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. Fits right in our kitchen, looks great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-happy">Not happy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about it. THE CLOCK RUNS ON MILITARY TIME ONLY! would not have bought it. Every time I look at it I am annoyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought it for my parents, was very easy to install, lightweight. Wish the lights were in the front; but it is not a big deal.</p>

<h5 id="great-range-i-have-2-of-these">Great range. I have 2 of these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great range. I have 2 of these. This one came with a little dent and I just noticed it. I don&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;return&rdquo; option so we&rsquo;re stuck with it as is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-re-getting-what-you-paid-for">You&rsquo;re getting what you paid for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came dented, poor design, weird set up. I made it work with some modifications. It&rsquo;s cheap, but I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it again. Because it&rsquo;s really, really cheap.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<p>some manufacturing dents and marking, but was able to hide to the rear&hellip;</p>
