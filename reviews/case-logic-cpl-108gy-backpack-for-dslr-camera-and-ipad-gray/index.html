<h5 id="but-this-bag-is-perfect-for-me">but this bag is perfect for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit unsure with everyone saying how small it was&hellip;but this bag is perfect for me. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;3&rdquo;, this fits like a normal bag. It&rsquo;s super comfortable. The rain guard is great. The quality is great. I can fit my Nikon D3100, the 18-55 kit lens, 55-200 lens, filters, cleaning tools &amp; lens hood and I still have a ton of room. I can put my tripod on this, too, so I&rsquo;m very happy overall with my purchase.In a few months after using it in the field, I&rsquo;ll edit my review with my experience. x3</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-thought-it-was-bigger">I thought it was bigger.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave it three stars because I honestly thought the backpack was much larger. I guess I should have paid more attention to the details when purchasing it. I am able to fit my Nikon D3200 with a 55mm kit lens pretty easily. I also am able to fit a full sized flash and a 200mm lens in it. Most of the cleaning equipment, extra batteries, chargers, and stuff fit in it pretty well. I like the top zipper - because it is roomy for odd-ball items that you wouldn&rsquo;t have any other place for. I am disappointed that I can not fit my tablet with the case in the back zipper. I am sure that i could fit the tablet in there by itself, but I have to have the keyboard on it to be able to use it efficiently.All in all, I wish that it was larger so that I could carry additional lenses and equipment when I go walking. I am not exactly sure how you could attach it to an additional backpack and keep it safe enough not to be stolen or keep something from breaking. I think that it would be easier to keep the backpack on hikes if there was a way to attach it to a larger backpack.I would recommend this backpack for people who need the extra room more than one of those small cases, but not for a professional photographer who carries a lot of extra prime lenses and things that need the extra room.</p>

<h5 id="good-backpack">Good Backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were planning a long trip and I wanted a lighter weight, easy access backpack for tours when I found this Case Logic bag. It is smaller than my other bags but will still take my d7000 with a 300 lens although it is tight. I could also fit a few other things like my point and shoot camera in the lower back section with the dslr (case comes with some velco shaping pads but I modified with some other velco pads I had too) and misc. small items in the top zippered section. When I flipped it on the side to get the camera out during a tour, someone commented on what a nice feature that was. Also liked that it had a section for ipads. We carried a Fire tablet in it but it fit the ipad too. Both my husband and I used it and the size was a relief after a long day. It did not look out of place with its smaller size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-dslr-bag">Fantastic dslr bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This bag is perfect. PERFECT. I cannot wait to use it for my upcoming travels overseas this year. It is lightweight and compact without being too small. I am a petite lady and this bag is not overwhelming in size on me. The design is lovely and modern. The bag features a good amount of pockets to carry snacks, sunglasses, and other travel pamphlets and passports and whatever else. This will be great for excursions and day trips. My canon rebel t5i fits just fine and has plenty of padding to keep it safe and in place. I love that the weather guard is included (though it took me a hot minute to find it in a small pouch on the bottom of the bag). The straps have been thoughtfully designed as well, with velcro pieces that keep everything nice and tidy. The zippers are great quality and glide nicely, so I know they will hold up for a long time. I have had Case Logic camera bags in the past and they have worn very well, so I know I&rsquo;m getting a quality product. So happy with my purchase!</p>

<h5 id="great-little-camera-bag">Great Little Camera Bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Sony A6000 and it&rsquo;s a little small for the case but I really like the case. Very well padded, it&rsquo;s got a slot for an ipad and enough little pockets so you won&rsquo;t lose your memory cards and what not. Overall great bag for the money. I also want to add one more thing. The bag is somehow very well balanced in that no matter what you put into it, it always stands up. Wish my Swiss Made backpack did that! Nice job people!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-perfect-i-carry-a-canon-5d-mark-ii-with">it&rsquo;s perfect. I carry a Canon 5D Mark II with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a camera bag forever. Couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind what I wanted and most bags are laid out awkwardly (in my opinion). This bag won&rsquo;t be ideal to shoot out of (unless you&rsquo;re able to set it down), but to travel with all my gear, and to have all my gear kept in one safe place when I&rsquo;m not using it, it&rsquo;s perfect. I carry a Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm, an 85mm, Speedlight, battery charger, extra batteries, extra cards and flash triggers in it. There&rsquo;s also a zippered pocket in the back for a tablet or notebook. Could probably fit a 3rd small/medium size lens in there. Very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-for-my-specialized-use">Very nice for my specialized use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I play guitar as a street performer. I use mine as a gig bag. I carry mine with me every day. It is very durable. Because the padding is so much thicker than a back pack, I have never damaged any of it&rsquo;s contents. And I pack it full. Very nice for my specialized use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing!The backpack pretty small but fits a lot of equipment. i usually do city travel and its perfect for this purpose.the quality of the bag is great, it&rsquo;s very soft, comfortable and doesn&rsquo;t feel heavy on your back.i usually travel with a 10-18mm lens, 50mm, 18-135mm, a flash, a few accessories such as remote, filters etc. and a few personal stuff like a wallet, a water bottle, two pairs of glasses and a kindle. compared to its&rsquo; size - it&rsquo;s A LOT of equipment.i also attach a tripod to it, specifically Hama Mini Traveller Pro.if you want a small bag, that can fit two-lenses, a body and personal stuff - i think this one is great!if you want quick access to your camera - go for to CPL-109BK backpack.i got the backpack a week earlier than expected, the packaging was farely big but wrapped good.</p>
