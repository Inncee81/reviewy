<h5 id="yes-i-had-the-battery-issue-and-you-re-pretty-much-guaranteed-to-as-well">Yes, I had the battery issue&hellip; and you&rsquo;re pretty much guaranteed to as well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Man&hellip; this thing is so cool. Quadcopters are so cool.I got this with the intent of scripting interactions with it. As it communicates over bluetooth, one can actually pair with it using their laptop/computer and if you know how, you can get it to fly using a program (and have it do scripted interactions).That&rsquo;s really hard though, and I can spin the motors but I&rsquo;m too cautious to programmatically control it just yet.And yes, I had the bloody battery issue. I was very busy and am only just getting around to fix it. If you submit a warranty claim though, they&rsquo;ll take it.. however they&rsquo;ll also offer up this advice:If you would like to try a potential fix, it may resolve the problem. Inside the drone there are 3 battery contacts that stick up from the bottom of the battery tray. Slightly bending these inward toward one another will allow them to make better contact with the battery and should resolve the problem. You want to be careful when doing these that you don&rsquo;t cause the pins to touch, or bend too much. This adjustment is best done with a small pair of needle nose pliers.The little guy does take a beating though. I still haven&rsquo;t broken a prop and I&rsquo;ve banged it around a bit, with and without wheels.It&rsquo;s balancing/position holding isn&rsquo;t very strong, and it seems to have some issues over grass where it&rsquo;ll start going down for landing and then just get stuck in the air, no longer responding to communication.Stuff like that actually seems to happen a lot, especially with landing/taking off, where it&rsquo;ll receive the action and just lock up. At least it doesn&rsquo;t fly away like it apparently used to!Overall, this is a nifty little device but quite expensive. If you want an intro quadcopter and don&rsquo;t mind a regular controller there are far cheaper ones of at least the same quality. However, the novelty of bluetooth connectivity was worth it to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this item for approx. one month now. I have not had any issues with battery life, other than being shorter than I would like. On average the battery tends to last the manufacturers quoted time of eight minutes without the wheel attachment. However, when performing flips and barrel rolls the flight time is significantly reduced. The controls, through a phone or tablet, did take some getting used to, but after a few flights are relatively easy to get the hang of. My only complaint is photos taken while flying are not automatically placed into your device&rsquo;s photos. I still tend to think the manufacturer website implies this capability. Overall, this thing is a blast and everyone I show it to wants one.</p>

<h5 id="great-drone-but-follow-this-rating">Great Drone But follow this rating!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok on here people are complaing about it taking off and being hard to use here is the truth I thought that at first too. Some things you will need to buy with this are extra blades and an extra or a couple extra batteries so you can practice. I have not had a problem with any of the batteries like some people have put either.Now to controlling it there are three sets of controls one is ace one is joystick and there is one normal. I have found anything other than the joystick a pain and seems to just go up and down the joystick gives you more control of the drone.Problems you may have: something&rsquo;s that I have found that messed up flight are one not charging the battery all the way because it seemed to just take off when I did that with no control and that&rsquo;s probably because the battery was dead. Two it didn&rsquo;t take off for me for a while and I figured out that I had the blades on the wrong parts even though they look the same they are different sizes. And three and this is going to happen when you first get it you are going to hit someone or something and hurt the blade meaning it will be off and it won&rsquo;t work quite right like I said before buy extra blades.Once you get the hang of it it does work I bought this because it was 100 bucks and I also bought the bebop drone and I wanted to practice with something that is a little more replaceable than the bebop. It is a good product you do need to do updates and things before you use it as well.I have seen many complaints about its range and it taking off but keep the battery up and have spares and it won&rsquo;t take off. Make sure the blades are good. Practice before trusting it out and if you have a house big enough to test the range try doing that before going outside so you know what the range is. And if you do wanna test it outside tie a string to it because I have also read that if its out of range it may take off so until you are comfortable with knowing what&rsquo;s going to happen test it out first.It&rsquo;s a good product follow this post and you will be successful trust me I got a little flustered a few times but once I got it down it works very well.</p>

<h5 id="this-drone-is-a-blast">This drone is a blast!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading all of these apocalyptic reviews of how horrible, terrible and downright evil this drone is. And I have to say that I&rsquo;m thinking that these &ldquo;reviewers&rdquo; might have some vested interest in trying to destroy its reputation.I do have to say that I&rsquo;m less than impressed by the documentation, but other than that I love this thing. It works beautifully with my Galaxy Tab S.The drone is fast and very responsive. I have no trouble at all controlling it. And if you are having any trouble learning how to control your drone there are some great videos on YouTube.</p>

<h5 id="parrot-minidrone-is-not-woth-the-price">Parrot MiniDrone is not woth the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy if this is your first drone. I owned several drones and have had this model for over 6 months. I replaced several batteries as well as propellers several times. When the propellers are damaged but still able to fly, the batteries will drain faster. I imagine this is expected. However the software that controls the drone will do what it wants to do with the drone at random interval - thus my needs to change propellers often. You can protect the drone by using the wheel but you will then give up precision flying experience.Pro:Easy to fly when Bluetooth connects correctlyCon:Bluetooth does not provide precision control.You are dependent on how well the software was tested for each update.When flying indoor, it randomly gets out of control and crash into a wall or furniture</p>
