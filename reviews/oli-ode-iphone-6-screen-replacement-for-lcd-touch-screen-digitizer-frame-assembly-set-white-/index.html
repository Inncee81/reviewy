<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the Price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works fine as a replacement, but just keep in mind that it is not the original apple replacement!Like the screen does not have the same &ldquo;vibrant&rdquo; colors or fonts as the original apple screen&hellip; now that isn&rsquo;t to say that the screen is horrible, just simply that for the price you pay there is some loss to the quality compared to the original screen!Overall: If you just want to repair your phone at a low cost, then this product works fine!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine-with-the-phone">Works fine with the phone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The item arrived on time and with the tools needed. I had it replaced by a technician. I didn&rsquo;t want to damage the phone, I am not skilled at this. The phone works fine with the new screen. The item came in a very well protected case that kept it safe. All the tools that came with it are very useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-value-and-perfect-fit">A GREAT value and perfect fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I usually do not write reviews because things generally don&rsquo;t deviate from what I expect and match reviews pretty well. This is an exception, and a good one. I was very weary of ordering a screen replacement at this price point and my expectation was that it MAY be ok but would not be a GREAT deal.It WAS a GREAT deal!!!It arrived per normal prime timeline.On the product itself, perfect fit, great quality and it works like a charm. No resolution issues and looks great with great fit.Installation can be tricky, it&rsquo;s moderately difficult. I wouldn&rsquo;t do this if your not comfortable with pulling apart an iPhone. You can find many online instructions on this.The wires on mine weren&rsquo;t a perfect fit. I had to do a little twisting but it didn&rsquo;t impact the final result.I know these items can be a gamble but this one was definitely a great deal. It&rsquo;s a BUY.Hope this helpsAnd thanks for a great product to the vendor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen-and-replacement-kit">Great Screen and replacement kit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: I&rsquo;ve been using the screen for about a month now and it is working perfectly fine. I changed my review to a 5 star because the LCD just needed some time to kick in. The screen is working just as if it was a new one..I ordered the screen and assembled it myself. The assembly went fine and the screen is responsive. The disassembly kit has all the tools you need to do it yourself. The reason I gave it <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars is because the quality of the screen isn&rsquo;t too great. I&rsquo;m writing this right after I assembled it and the colors don&rsquo;t calibrate like the apple Retina display screen.P.S.if your going to disassemble your phone yourself be aware of where you put all the screws in the iPhone.Also the screwdriver In the kit might not work for each screw.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-fit">awesome fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very good fit, please note that you have to be very careful when putting on, I rarely get a defective lcd from any vendor but I see a lot of negative reviews and makes me wonder is the buyer installing correctly? does the frame in any way bent? in case it is bent and sometimes is not visible your lcd won&rsquo;t flush correctly, that being said this is by far the best lcd I&rsquo;ve got</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="find-a-good-tutorial-online">find a good tutorial online</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As described! The install was simple. Just take your time; find a good tutorial online. There are many of them. Screen appears to have the same quality as OEM. Capacitive touch seems the same as OEM.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-phone-works-perfect-now">My phone works perfect now!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as expected. My phone works perfect now!! $30 kit so worth not paying a professional $150. I just picked up a micro Philip&rsquo;s screwdriver from Home Depot and did the job!Kit contains all the pieces necessary. Watch a youtube video on how to do it - you&rsquo;ll have the screen swapped out in &lt; 1 hour. (experienced people will be quicker, but my 13 year old son and I took our time so he could see the inside of it - even then I bet it was 45 minutes to an hour)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tool-kit">great tool kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been looking for an iPhone repair kit for a while,in case you don&rsquo;t know, IPhones and IPods are [packed extreme alt tight during assembly and you just cant take a regular screw driver and just pop out a few screws to do repairs ,they require Special tools in order to do the repairs the right way,My iPhone tool case arrived on well before expected with minimal packaging.. all the necessary tools were included,,, 3 Professional grade screwdrivers suction cup to help install Screens Easier, a SIM card tray key a pair of stainless steel heavy duty tweezers , two tool to help. When reinstating the screen and adhesive foam backing pieces to make sure reassembling goes smoothly, why waste money on a pro install when you can just purchse a tool kit and do it your self ,, .</p>

<h5 id="this-was-way-better-than-my-expectation">This was way better than my expectation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was way better than my expectation. I was expecting a screen with a lower resolution or a darker screen, but everything works amazingly.</p>
