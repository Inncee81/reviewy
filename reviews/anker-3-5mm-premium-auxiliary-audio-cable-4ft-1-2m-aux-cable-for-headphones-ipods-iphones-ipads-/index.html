<h5 id="you-would-expect-that-a-premium-cable-would-be-sturdy-and-last-years-to-come-but">You would expect that a premium cable would be sturdy and last years to come but</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately it did not last a year. You would expect that a premium cable would be sturdy and last years to come but, just as many people reported, the connector falls apart after some non intense use. Check attached picture.Update 1/26/2017:Extremely pro-active customer service from Anker (I was genuinely surprised), they just asked for the S/N and shipped me a brand new one. Apparently I had a cable from a bad batch. 5 stars for the customer service, will replace my cable and keep using it on a daily basis, will update the review if anything else comes up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-customer-service">Good Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cable that I had purchased originally had broken within three months, as shown in the picture, so I had written a negative review on this product. However, Anker reached out to me a few days after I posted the review informing me that the one that I received may have been defective and they offered me a free replacement. This whole process went very smoothly and I now have a new one in my possession that works great. Here&rsquo;s to hoping that this one will last me for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-product-has-lasted-me-a-long-time">Amazing product, has lasted me a long time!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this aux cable. No I did not get this product for free! I have a phone case that is tight around the audio jack and I required a cable with a small casing around it. I was tired of cutting the casing off of all my other cables.I find that with aux cables in particular they tend to break SO EASILY and I have to replace them all the time. This has been such a life saver! It has not broken and I&rsquo;ve had no issues with it at all.The rubber of the cable itself is a nice texture and I&rsquo;ve had no problems with it breaking in any places. I really trust anker with my tech accessories, and this cable is amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-cable-even-more-solid-company">Solid cable, even more solid company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>: Anker contacted me after reading my review and sent me an extension that is slim and fixed any issue I had with the cable. As in the past Anker has gone above and beyond my expectations to provide stellar customer service. Thank you for being a great company!Really high quality cable, feels nice and solid. My one complaint would be I still have to take my case off of my phone to plug the jack all the way in. the inner lip is fine but its the larger outer lip that catches. Really annoying! I guess i&rsquo;ll keep looking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="anker-makes-quality-products">Anker makes quality products!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As with every Anker product I have purchased, it exceeds my expectations! This audio cable feels like it is high quality&hellip;well-made, high quality materials&hellip; and upon first using it, it performed perfectly! One thing that was unexpected was an email I received from Anker asking if the cable had &ldquo;lived up to my expectations&rdquo;. Scrolling down the way, it had an attachment on how to wrap the velcro strap to bundle the cable. I had not figured it out yet so that was appreciated!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-but-one-problem">Works great but one problem..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The aux cable works great.. rating a 3 star because for some reason it produces a pitch noise while charging my phone in my car. The charger cable that I&rsquo;m using is the Anker 6ft red nylon cable. I&rsquo;m not sure what is causing the pitch noise&hellip;(maybe incompatible) also the little silver thing that has the Anker brand on it keeps coming off if I pull it firm. I have to remove it slowly.UPDATE: Anker reached out to me by email to issue me a new cable without having to return the defective one due to inconvenience. So far so good with the new cable. Their customer service is really great. Will continue buying Anker merchandise due to their great customer service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="over-a-full-year-of-use-and-still-working-perfectly">Over a full year of use and still working perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great so far. I use it in my carpool car and we haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it so far. The jack in the car is at the very front and this just barely reaches people in the middle row. Keep in mind that if you want to have people in the middle row use it often, you might want to get a 5ft cable for maximum comfort. Been using it for over a month now.Update: After over a full year of use between a few different cables in different cars, it is still working just as it did on day one. Perfect cable and cheap, too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-for-use-in-the-car">Amazing for use in the car.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this cable to plug my cell phone (android) into my Car stereo via the AUX port. I&rsquo;ve used other cables in the past and thought it was good enough. This cable is flexible even in winter and the sound quality is beyond believable. I don&rsquo;t have to turn my phone all the way up to hear the music and the static that happened occasionally with other cables was completely gone. I can&rsquo;t believe how big a difference one cable made.Thanks Anker</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-very-durable">Not very durable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I usually buy Anker products and don&rsquo;t have a problem at all with them, but this cable broke within a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-quality-of-this-cable-has-to-be-seen-to">The quality of this cable has to be seen to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality of this cable has to be seen to be believed. I think I&rsquo;ll become an Anker evangelist.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-stars">5 stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality. Been using it for almost a year and hasn&rsquo;t torn like all the other aux cords out there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-pretty-good-it-sits-in-my-car-all-day">It&rsquo;s pretty good. It sits in my car all day &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good. It sits in my car all day and all night and I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well and is durable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-choice">Good choice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good quality. Cable itself is like a &lsquo;mini hose&rsquo; that is difficult to get mangled. Metal connectors seem durable and strong. The cable strap is a nice premium detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simply-the-best">Simply the Best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is with aux cables, but most of them are junk. I&rsquo;ll use them for about a month, and then they get to the point where you have to hold it completely still in&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-em">Like&rsquo;em</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked fantastic, until I slammed it with my car door. Lasted awhile considering the daily use I put it through.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great aux cord. It&rsquo;s a good length for use in vehicles and it&rsquo;s pretty sturdy material for a cord.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of-your-money">Waste of your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this yesterday. Worked great and it&rsquo;s already full of static and doesn&rsquo;t work right. Waste of my money..</p>
