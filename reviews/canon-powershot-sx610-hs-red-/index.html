<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Superb Zoom for Spectacular Range</p>

<p>18x Optical Zoom
The powerful 18x Optical Zoom range (35mm equivalent: 25–450mm) on the PowerShot SX610 HS camera is ideal for capturing memories of kids&rsquo; achievements on the sporting field, recitals, plays and concerts – all those times when your access to the action is limited. From landscapes and wildlife to city scenes and more, this camera has you covered – all while fitting in your pocket. Zooming action is quick and precise, and genuine Canon optics help ensure brilliant clarity. Chromatic aberration is compensated across the entire range, and the lens&rsquo;s high optical resolving power works with the camera&rsquo;s high-resolution sensor and advanced image stabilization systems to produce clear, sharp, beautifully detailed images at any zoom length.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Connect and Share With a Touch</p>

<p>Beautiful Images and Incredible Performance Start Here
20.2 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor
The PowerShot SX610 HS camera employs a 20.2 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels</li>
</ul>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot SX610 HS camera&rsquo;s advanced functions and capabilities, including Hybrid Auto, Creative Shot, and Full HD video shooting at 30p in the easy-to-share MP4 format. Its accelerated processing speed creates fast, responsive performance, for a shooting experience that&rsquo;s easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations, and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system compensates for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur, and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The result is images that are reliably sharp and clear at all lengths of the camera&rsquo;s powerful zoom. The processor&rsquo;s highly efficient design also extends battery life.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM helps provide excellent low-light performance
The slim, compact PowerShot SX610 HS camera gives you the power to capture beautifully detailed, naturally lit images even in low light – reducing the need for flash and the occasionally unwelcome effects it produces. That&rsquo;s because the camera&rsquo;s 20.2 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works with the DIGIC 4+ Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM, specifically engineered for spectacular low-light performance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you&rsquo;ll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at ISO speeds up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Capture Your Adventures in Stunning Full HD
Full HD Video
Gorgeous high definition video is yours throughout the camera&rsquo;s impressive zoom range, and starts immediately with a touch of the dedicated movie button. The PowerShot SX610 HS camera captures Full HD video at 30p (selectable for resolution), for notably smooth, lifelike quality that is truly at home even on a large screen HDTV. And now you can record in convenient MP4 format for the easiest online sharing.</p>

<p>Clear Viewing, Easy Shooting
3.0-inch High Resolution (922,000 dots) LCD
The large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of 922,000 dots makes even the smallest details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle, so showing others what you&rsquo;ve captured is easy, too.</p>

<p>Rethink Photography with Creative Shot
Creative Shot mode
In addition to the versatile power of its amazing 18x Optical Zoom, the PowerShot SX610 HS camera also turns out impressive artistic photos with Creative Shot mode. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.</p>

<p>Shoot Carefree with Advanced PowerShot Technologies
Hybrid Auto
The PowerShot SX610 HS camera features Hybrid Auto, which records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, or any time you&rsquo;re shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this &ldquo;highlight reel&rdquo; is stunningly beautiful. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smart AUTO
Sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button, Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. On the PowerShot SX610 HS camera, detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to help ensure the best possible image capture, whether you&rsquo;re shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<p>Shooting Modes/Special Scene Modes
Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Movie Digest &amp; Hybrid Auto  Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day&rsquo;s worth of clips are then combined into a single video.
Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.
Creative Shot   Analyzes the scene and applies a number of creative filters to automatically create five variations in addition to the original image.
Portrait    Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background.
Smart Shutter   The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame.
High-Speed Burst    Captures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down.
Handheld Night Scene    Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod.
Low Light   For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Fisheye Effect  Now you can get the fisheye effect – a classic photographic distortion – without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect    Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with &ldquo;toy&rdquo; or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Snow    Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.
Fireworks   Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.
Movie   Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.
Actual results may vary from examples shown above.
Final image may vary depending on picture composition.</p>

<p>Perfect Zoom Shots Made Easy
Auto Zoom
Now, beautifully framed shots using the powerful 18x Optical Zoom are as easy as pressing the Auto Zoom button. With Auto Zoom, the camera automatically determines the correct size and framing by detecting the number of subjects. The system also detects faces that are too small, then zooms in to the proper length. Auto Zoom is a great feature for spontaneous everyday shooting, and especially useful for times when someone else (even a child) is using your camera, for instance at a tourist spot.</p>

<p>I had a Canon SX230 forever and decided to try a new Canon camera. So the SX610 (in white) it was!PROS:* The picture quality is stunning!* The zoom lens works VERY fast* There is image stabilization with the zoom and pictures at 18x zoom actually look pretty good* Movie quality is awesome!* Low light pictures turn out well* Camera itself is very lightweight* I like the little rubber thing on the front to help hold the camera better* Battery seems to last much longer than past Canon&rsquo;s I have owned* Has a dedicated movie button for those (like me) that take a lot of video* Has High Speed BurstCONS:* The normal dial I am used to on the top of most Canon point-n-shoot cameras is not there anymore (you have to change your options through the function set button)* There is no &lsquo;sports&rsquo; mode (I used that mode quite a bit on my SX230)* The manual flash is pretty annoying (sometimes very annoying!)* When recording video, the focus sometimes goes in and out* The &lsquo;creative shot&rsquo; is weird in my opinion and useless (it really doesn&rsquo;t do much of anything CREATIVE to the pictures)I have not tried using the WiFi so I cannot comment on that (I have a USB cable and upload the old fashioned way!) All in all, I really like this camera and I find myself shooting mostly in Portrait mode or High Speed Burst (for my kids&rsquo; fast movements). I will hang onto this camera for a long time and consider it a great purchase!Oh, and I love the white color of the camera body!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved the ease of videoing with this camera. I was looking for a digital camera I could use from the back of a horse while walking down the trails. This one does OK but not wonderful. I take 200 to 300 pictures per ride just to get a few that aren&rsquo;t blurred. Wish it had better image stabilization. I have not found anything that is as good as my old S700 Fujifilm which died. Even the Fuji cameras can&rsquo;t do as good a job while in motion as that old camera did :( So if you can be still to focus and shoot this camera would likely be very good. The weight it good and it fits easily into a little bag on my saddle. Love that much about it.</p>
