<h5 id="wonderful-ell-sport-s-set-massage-ball-is-for-mobility-the-ball-helps-with-my-painful-arthritis-the-jump-rope-will-help-alot">Wonderful ELL SPORT&rsquo;S Set. Massage ball is for mobility. the ball helps with my painful Arthritis, the jump rope will help alot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally amazing ELL SPORT&rsquo;S Set Massage ball is for mobility!! I love this massage ball so much, I suffer from Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis as well &amp; the ball helps to work out pain and working on the joints to massage and loosen the muscles rubbing against the bones. I am looking forward to using the Jump Rope as well.. Hopefully once I get my Arthritis under control I will be able to jump rope to tighten muscles and get into shape as well!! Awesome products and very well made. Will spread the word about these amazing products!!</p>

<h5 id="my-tired-feet-thank-me">My tired feet thank me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I try and run 3.1 miles 3 times a week. Between that and chasing after my 3 kids each day my feet are tired. I try my hardest to get my husband to massage them but he just doesn&rsquo;t seem to go for it. I had read reviews that this worked wonders on your feet so I decided to give it a try. So far I am really enjoying it. It is so easy to roll my feet over for a few minutes each night.I hope you found this review helpful. If you did I would appreciate it if you would click YES below!</p>

<h5 id="finally-help-for-planter-fasciitis">Finally Help For Planter Fasciitis</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband has planter fasciitis and suffers from pretty bad pain after a long day at work. We were using a frozen bottle for his feet but it wasn&rsquo;t helping very much so the doctor suggested to buy one of these balls. This ball works wonders on his feet. Unlike the smooth texture on the bottle this ball has an uneven texture which seems to be much more effective. The jump rope was an added bonus for my daughter. We love this set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have seen how my friends are using lacrosse balls after training, in order to massage the body. I wanted to try too! I&rsquo;ve searched for something similar on Amazon. I&rsquo;ve ordered this particular set because I buy the ball and skipping rope separately anyway. When I received it I was amazed with quality of the product. Everything taken care of- skipping rope complements the ball accompanied by a travel bag!�I&rsquo;m rating 5</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="toc_7">:)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This massage ball is absolutely fantastic. I purchased this massage ball has a gift for one of my good friends who is a personal trainer. He often times is caught using tennis balls to massage sore muscles and I thought it was time for him to get an actual professional product to use. This massage ball has been fantastic has held up very well and everyone comments on it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having some foot pain - with work and then with my son sitting on my foot - so I was looking for something to help with the pain and to massage it - Saw this from Ell Group - very well made - simple to use - helped with my foot pain - you can use this on your elbow, your chest, your butt, neck, back, shoulder.Nice jumping rope!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-feet-also">Great for the feet also</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I never thought to use a massage ball on my elbows - I&rsquo;ve only done feet, calves and back. I wish I had known sooner. Great for the feet also, Charlie horses, and your lower back/hip. It&rsquo;s a hard ball, you really want to get your trigger points with it as not much sticks out from the ball. Great storage bag. Cross fit jump rope is good too.</p>

<h5 id="it-uses-a-pressure-point-feeling-to-alleviate-the-tightness-which-i-like-it-was-a-mbonus-to-get-the-jump">It uses a pressure point feeling to alleviate the tightness which I like. It was a mbonus to get the jump &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this massage ball works so well when the low back is tight. I lay on the floor with the ball under my midback and roll it back and forth with movement. It uses a pressure point feeling to alleviate the tightness which I like. It was a mbonus to get the jump rope with this order. I can work out and relax at the same time frame.</p>
