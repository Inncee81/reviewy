<h5 id="great-receiver-awesome-value">Great receiver, awesome value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This receiver has met or exceeded all of my expectations. I used it with a 5.1 Polk speaker setup. There are connections for two subwoofers but you only need one.The sound output is great. The higher sounds are clear with no tinniness, and the bass sounds from the subwoofer really help bring the overall sound to life. Use the Auto Calibration to start, then use the Manual setup to adjust to your liking. I ended up increasing the volume of the rear speakers a lot so I can really hear the sound behind me.The inputs offer both HDMI for newer devices and A/V inputs for older devices.The only critique I have is that there was a quite a lot of setup necessary to get everything working properly. The HDTV setup was fine, just make sure that the input is set to ARC, if your TV offers it.The main difficulty I had with the setup was to get my Wii and Blu-ray player hooked up with the older video settings. First, when I plugged it in, nothing worked. Then, I got the video but no sound, then the sound but no video. I think the receiver may not identify the input at first. Try turning the receiver off and then on again to get it to recognize the input. Also, the input from the TV will be different for A/V input.Once I got both the sound and video working, the sound came through the speakers but only the front ones, not the rear. I tried changing all of the settings on the Speaker settings menu with no luck. The speaker pattern only listed options with two or three speakers so I thought I was out of luck. Then, I spotted a clue in the manual under the Audio Settings. It was the Sound Field. The default setting was 2 ch stereo. I changed it to Multi Stereo and TA DA! It worked great. I learned that there is a difference between Linear PCM (what the TV uses) and Dolby Digital (what the Wii and Blu-Ray player use), which is why the TV had been working but not the other inputs. So to sum up, the process took a long time, but in the end everything works exactly as I had hoped.I would definitely recommend this as a first time receiver to anyone interested in having surround sound for their TV, Blu-ray player, or video game system.</p>

<h5 id="great-when-it-worked">Great!&hellip; when it worked.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked Great&hellip;. for a month.Really like the on screen programing, and anything attached via HDMI powers up the unit when turned on. cool feature!The video and sound quality was excellent when it worked.4K compatible!Sadly the HDMI video out stopped working one day, no reason or warning. Not sure why the failure.but only working for a month, I can&rsquo;t recommend it. It may be a fluke, or it may be a problem with this model. Not sure, for now it&rsquo;s going back, and I guess I&rsquo;m in the market once more for a receiver.</p>

<h5 id="receiver-good-customer-service-bad">Receiver good - customer service bad!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great receiver. I purchase new speakers to use with it and I&rdquo;m very satisfied. The instructions are a little vague, but eventually you&rsquo;ll figure it out. Customer service was terrible. The first receiver I got was defective. I called customer service and couldn&rsquo;t get the guy to understand that I had an older tv that didn&rsquo;t have the same menu as the instructions. He finally hung up on me. The second guy I got told me I had to buy a new tv! I finally got a woman that said I must have a defective receiver and made arrangements for mine to be returned and a new one sent. For the price it&rsquo;s a good little receiver.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-receiver-for-medium-size-room">Excellent Receiver for medium size room</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy setup. I needed a unit to support the following equiptment: Sat (Directv) receiver, Xbox 360, Roku 2. As I have a Sony HD TV, the remote for the receiver powers both units. After connecting all the speaker wires for surround sound, I then connected HDMI cords to each unit, plugged them into the associated HDMI input ports on the receiver, then used one HDMI cord, plugged it into the &ldquo;HDMI Out&rdquo; port on the receiver, and to one of the HDMI input ports on the TV. Piece of cake! Using the remote, all I have to do is select &ldquo;Game&rdquo; for the Xbox, &ldquo;Sat/Cable&rdquo; for TV, or &ldquo;BD&rdquo; for the Roku. I have high speed internet, so streaming is terrific, oustanding HD and sound! Great little unit , sounds almost as good as the large Yamaha we have in the great room.Would highly recommend it especially for those with a modest budget like me.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-receiver-with-one-issue">Great value receiver with one issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not need a big, fancy receiver. Just something to plug my speakers into to get surround sound. I am very pleased with this one. The price is great and it does everything I need. The only problem I found with it, is that the hdmi ports seem to be very loose. I plugged my hdmi cables in, and every time I would try to move the receiver into place, they literally fell out. I knew something was wrong. It wasn&rsquo;t my cables because they were brand new and fit beautifully into my tv, cable box, etc. I contacted Amazon for a replacement. They shipped it out immediately. The new one is better, but connections are still way looser than they should be. I wonder if others have had this same trouble. Usually the cables click right into place and don&rsquo;t move. I hate that they wiggle around, which is why I only gave this 4 stars. I would still recommend this receiver however.</p>

<h5 id="nice-receiver-amp">Nice Receiver / Amp.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice as it has HDMO inputs which keeps volume control consistent among various devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="couldn-t-be-more-pleased">Couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are always things that a fussy electronics user (as in yours truly) would do differently; but, that aside, this thing is great. Lots of functions and lots of usage possibilities make for a bit of a learning curve, but once I settled in on what I wanted, I really started to appreciate the receiver. In fact, there were a couple of features that disappointmented me, and then I discovered settings that resolved what I didn&rsquo;t like.I use it in conjunction with a large-screen TV with multiple sources (DirecTV, Roku, and a desktop computer). The only thing missing for me is caller i.d. Other than that, I like the sound; I like the range of settings; I like the remote control; I like the display; I like its aesthetics; and, I like the price.</p>
