<h5 id="well-designed-pack-to-comfortably-carry-a-medium-load">Well-designed pack to comfortably carry a medium load.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mardingtop Tactical Backpack will comfortably carry a medium load. It is designed well, with a large main compartment, a small second compartment (both of which run about 20&rdquo; from top to bottom of the pack), and a front half-pack flap compartment.The main compartment has a sleeve for a hydration bladder and a port for the drink tube. The second compartment has a mesh sleeve with zipper access. The flap pocket has small organizing slots and a key swivel. The shoulder straps are ergonomic and comfortably handle a medium load. The zippers are heavy duty, the buckles appear to be fastex buckles, and the 600 cordura nylon is treated on the inside to repel water. The only drawback on the pack is its lack of drain holes on the bottom, thus the 4 star rating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-solid-pack">Good, solid pack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this pack and have a lot of experience and miles in the woods. I spent an afternoon at my local Cabela’s looking for a daypack to hike with and keep in my truck <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> and feel this Mardingtop is basically the same, if not from the same factory, as the 5.11 “2 Day” for a third of the price. The stitching is well done and the coil zippers are heavy duty. I use this pack loaded for 4-hour hikes in the woods weekly with my German Shepherd and it is comfortable and well thought out. There are many good packs out there from Vertex, Mystery Ranch and Maxpedition to name a few good ones but for my purpose and budget I have been very pleased with the quality.There are two things I will point out: First, the grab handle is integrated into the yoke of the harness, which I like. I’m also 5’ 11” 165 pounds and at 50 getter shorter by the day. If you are barrel-chested the grab handle may rub against your neck around C6 since the design does take up some adjustability. If you are 300 pounds and are Googling “tactical packs” go back to the basement and watch more shoot ‘em up YouTube videos because you will have a heart attack walking up a flight of stairs so the fact that this pack will not fit you is irrelevant.A minor thing I would change if I had design input would be the two zippered pockets on each side: The zippers are designed to be accessible from the rear with the pack off and they travel about half way around the pocket. I would like to see the zipper continue around the whole pocket so you could access some food by reaching back with the pack on and grabbing a zipper tag. It’s not a deal breaker but I feel it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<h5 id="ehh-it-s-ok">Ehh it&rsquo;s ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very very disappointed in the MOLLE points they&rsquo;re very very weak and not the best for MOLLE attachments. If using as a school back pack or for traveling then it&rsquo;s worth it other wise it&rsquo;s not. Seeing it&rsquo;s made in China I think I&rsquo;m going to send it back and spend a lot more on something Amarican made.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-military-backpack-mardingtop">the best military backpack mardingtop !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i&rsquo;m loving my new military backpack in blacki uesd it for work in it a good quality i well buy again from mardingtop in khaki color .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-spacious-bag-for-a-good-price">High quality, spacious bag for a good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this backpack for a trip to Switzerland for using as a day hiking bag. Also used it to travel around and carry a couple laptops. The main compartment is very spacious, was able to fit several jackets and food inside. This bag is very nicely designed, the quality is top and the zippers are not only smooth but well positioned opening enough for easy access. I really enjoyed the side pockets that were large enough to fit a good size water bottle being accessible without having to remove the backpack. The other side bag I used for snacks. Inside you have plenty of space and dividers to accomodate and organize lots of things. It was comfortable to carry for many hours and for my use more than sturdy enough. The only two things I would like to see are a greater color selection and having a velcro to secure the waist straps when not used. I looked into the 5.11 but the price was quite higher with less space. Other backpacks were either smaller or didn&rsquo;t have side pockets or quality did not seem good. This is a great bang for the buck with a perfect size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-a-little-bit-bigger">Just a little bit bigger!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. everything is good, but I wish they made the side water pouch a little bit bigger because it fits the nalgene 32 oz bottle but its a tight fit.and for the organizing pockets it needs some depth/width to it, at least 1 inch rectangle in the bottom because it is , its very flat to the bag (kinda like a manilla folder with no rectangle base, opens like a v shape not a U shape</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-design-is-good-it-puts-the-weight-on-your-hips">The design is good. It puts the weight on your hips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The design is good. It puts the weight on your hips. Material is very good. However, the stitching for the molle strip wasn&rsquo;t properly done near the velco patch. I would have returned it, but had to use it on a trip. The location is not a typical place to attach something and there were more than enough molle strips elsewhere to attach what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-everything-school-gym-hiking-bug-out-etc">Great for everything; school, gym, hiking, bug out, etc.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality backpack at a great price. The hip pads have a spot made into the back area to fold away for more casual use. Zippers are very nice, Padding is exceptional. I use this for school and with a fully loaded pack it feels much lighter than with previous backpacks.</p>

<h5 id="100-cheaper-than-5-11-with-80-of-the-quality">$100 cheaper than 5.11 with 80% of the quality</h5>

<p>For the price, 5 stars is accurate. No weak seams found, some zippers are double zippers (but not all unfortunately) and it seems that it will hold up well long term.</p>
