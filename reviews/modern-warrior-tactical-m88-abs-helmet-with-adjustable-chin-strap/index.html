<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-for-what-i-need-it-to">Works for what I need it to</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this helmet as part of a display project. For that it worked great! I painted it using krylon and it came out real nice. It shinier now that I added a clear coat and water sealant.If you wanted this for cosplay or Airsoft I would say it&rsquo;s nice for that. The straps are a bit cheap and chinsy but still decent for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-this-price-it-s-a-great-deal-but-it-depends-on-what-you-plan">For this price it&rsquo;s a GREAT deal, but it depends on what you plan &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It gets 4 stars mainly for the price. For this price it&rsquo;s a good deal, but it depends on what you plan on using it for. I got it for my sons costume for Halloween, and for that it is fantastic. However I would think if you were using it for paintball or airsoft you might want to make some adjustments. It uses rivets instead of actual hardware, and cheap webbing so i doubt it will hold up under rugged conditions. The chin strap itself is horrible. Expect to wobble everywhere. Then again the actual old PASGT chin straps were not very good. It would drive up the price a bit, but a surplus 4 point retention strap would make it far more comfy and a better less wobbly fit. Also if you really wanted to make it nice you could replace the webbing with pads&hellip;.you&rsquo;ll have to drill out the rivets and use your own hardware though. Still for 15 bucks this is a great lil ABS knockoff. (EDIT: I purchased an actual USMC 4 point made for the LWH system, I had to drill four holes and the thinner helmet then a real one means you may need some spacers but this works much better, and my son can run with it stable even with webbing and no pads. If you are an airsofter I strongly would suggest getting a 4 point retention system, though it will cost twice as much as helmet. The different hardware stands out, but with a camo cover you won&rsquo;t see the different hardware. This works so well I am giving it 5 stars because again the price and durability of helmet itself is incredible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-good-looking-piece">It&rsquo;s a good looking piece</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good looking piece, good replica of what the real combat helmets look like, I give it four stars because I inspected it&hellip; when it came the metal pieces had rust on it&hellip; It&rsquo;s not designed for real combat though, perhaps airsoft, but a knife and bullet would go through it without much force. That being said, if you think it is Kevlar&hellip; it is not, it is plastic, a toy, a replica, so if you are buying it because you think that it would offer you protection don&rsquo;t waste your money.At the most part it could be a good costume piece for Halloween or something like that, but again, not to be used for combat. If you want a real tactical helmet, your going to need a Kevlar helmet, and they start anywhere from $45.00-$1,000.00+ depending upon origin, grade, and design. So if you want a real helmet&hellip; buy a Kevlar helt, or you can even find an M1 Helmet from Vietnam or WWII in good condition, and parts, covers, and add-ons for them as well, much cheaper since we have Kevlar helmets in use now, but still durable and combat worthy, as they were designed for that sole purpose. Have a great day, I hope this helped some of you choose to save your money.</p>

<h5 id="awesome">AWESOME!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is the situation. I bought this to use WITH my paintball mask. I wanted a swat team look while I played. You can see from the photos that this helmet fots perfectly for that purpose. All you need to do is remove the visor of your mask and adjust the helmet&rsquo;s chin strap to your comfort and so that it is secure while you play! The helmet itself was surprisingly heavy and did not feel cheap at all. This will protect my head from paint 100%. I would highly recommend this! this doesn&rsquo;t add to &ldquo;more fog&rdquo; or anything like that either. I have an anti fog mask and it works fantastic and the helmet does not make it hotter or more foggy or anything like that. AWESOME PRODUCT! Shipped quickly with NO PROBLEMS!!</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great, I turned mine into samurai helmets for my 2 lite samurai, take a look</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-a-cosplay-but-my-head-is-tiny">Great for a cosplay, but my head is tiny</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for a Tank Girl cosplay I&rsquo;m working on. I love it. It&rsquo;s easy to paint on, it has netting inside the helmet, and it has an adjustable chin strap. I do have a tiny head, so it&rsquo;s rather large on me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-reviewers-were-right-about-this-one">The reviewers were right about this one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Picked this up for a costume piece and I am pretty pleased with it. Searching for one on Amazon can be quite the daunting task because there are so many manufactures, styles, prices, and quality. I didn&rsquo;t need one for paintball but I wanted it to look fairly authentic, good quality, and at a decent price. Thankfully, reading the reviews on Amazon eventually brought about the decision to go with this particular one. It comes exactly as pictured and the other reviewers pictures helped in determining if this was going to work or not as well. It&rsquo;s made out of a pretty hard thick plastic and I can see why those who participate in paintball activities would like this. Up close, you can tell that it isn&rsquo;t metal or ballistic grade material, but further away&hellip;it looks like the real deal. Some sort of steel/metal rivets hold the chin strap and head mesh in place. The straps themselves seem to be the weakest piece of the helmet. They definitely are not the thickest quality straps out there but I think they will perform well for what I need them for. The adjustment buckles are made out plastic and this doesn&rsquo;t look too robust either. Make sure to set the straps correctly so you don&rsquo;t have to keep making adjustments and don&rsquo;t go ripping this off your head in a fit of rage when someone gets the best of you in the game!The helmet is quite comfortable to wear and is light on your head. It looks great and at the time that I purchased it, the price was $15. It&rsquo;s going to work great for me as a costume piece, but I think with the proper care, this would be excellent in keeping those paintballs from giving you a headache. The pictures from the other reviewers and the one in the product window are very accurate. The high review feedback was also a plus in helping me choose which helmet to go with. I recommend.</p>

<h5 id="won-t-stop-a-bullet-but-it-looks-like-it-could">Won&rsquo;t stop a bullet, but it looks like it could&hellip;&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a youth or child&rsquo;s helmet. It is a full adult size. Overall I was impressed by the quality. If you are a paintballs or airsoft enthusiast, then you need this helmet. Made of pretty thick plastic and has a pretty decent suspension system inside. Good quality webbing adjusts inside the helmet to fit your side and nice chinstrap to help hold it in place on those tough tactical assaults.</p>
