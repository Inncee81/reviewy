<h5 id="great-monitor-with-power-adapter">great monitor with power adapter.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really need a wireless camara to monitor my yard. Now I don’t have to worry about some stranger approaching my yard. The video is clear enough to see a person’s face, and even for little animals. The night mode (IR) video is also clear. It operates with a power adapter, not a battery. So you have to find a way to get the power outlet connect to the power adapter.I didn’t test with the motion detector. I would like to try it later and may update for that.</p>

<h5 id="live-coverage-is-great-will-not-record-motion-activated-image-video">Live coverage is great, will not record motion activated image/video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this camera specifically for the ability to record to the micro SD card via motion activated capability. All the other specifications seem to work fine, given that this is a very inexpensive unit. However, the motion activated images &amp; video capability does not work. The manual recordings record fine to the micro SD card. I get the alert on my iphone when a motion activated recording is saved but when I access the recorded file from the list, the app advises that the &ldquo;Alert has Expired&rdquo;. When I refresh, it advises that there is no video recorded in the file. I&rsquo;ve tried everything I can think of (I consider myself an above average user) and have contacted via email the listed contact on the Amazon page and am awaiting their response.</p>
