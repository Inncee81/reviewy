<h5 id="amazing-it-works-great-with-my-kindle">Amazing! It works great with my kindle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing! It works great with my kindle! The best part is that you can bend it and it has 3 levels of brightness. Would buy it again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-didn-t-need-a-new-kindle-i-needed-a-new-light">I didn&rsquo;t need a new Kindle, I needed a new light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased and tried just about every clip on reading Book light for my Kindles that I could think of. I tried the Kandle and several others, but nothing worked. They either were so big that the front clip on part blocked some of my page print area, kept falling off because the were designed poorly or they did not illuminate the entire Kindle screen area. Most did all of these. I was so beyond frustrated that I wound up purchasing a Kindle Fire so that I did not have to purchase a book light, only to find out that with my aging eyes and beginning cataracts the LED light shining right into my eyes hurt my eyes terribly, and I was afraid of doing further damage to my eyes. So i considered purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite so that the LED light would be guided toward the surface of the display instead of right into my face, but I just did not want to spend anymore money on Kindles if I did not have to. I only use my Kindles for reading and not for web surfing or other internet activities.Ergo, before I spent another expensive dime on a new Kindle I decided to make a last ditch effort in finding a suitable Clip on light for my 2 older Kindles. Well, I finally hit pay dirt with this GTMax clip on light. It is GREAT! It clips on tightly to my Kindle with its silicone sleeve, the short front clip on part does not overhang and block any of my screen reading area, the longer back clip on part is not too heavy to weigh down my Kindle, and it even seems to stabilize the book light on my Kindle that much better than the clip on lights I tried that were short both on the front and the back. Best of all, the light illuminates the entire screen area, it takes regular AAA batteries you can buy everywhere, and the price is just right.If you don&rsquo;t use your Kindle for more than reading, and you don&rsquo;t want to spend the extra money for a Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Fire to be able to read in the dark, just get one of these GTMax clip on lights and you will be all set. I am so happy with mine I came on here to purchase a second one and then decided to also write a review to help anyone else looking for an inexpensive reading light for their basic Kindle that actually works.</p>

<h5 id="too-bright-tinker-fix">Too bright???! Tinker Fix!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed some reviews remarked on how the light was still too bright on the lowest setting.The following is for tinkers or those who dare to live on the wild side and void warranties (it&rsquo;s a $15 light and no harm will come to it.):To solve this take a 6-8 inch strip of aluminum foil, then fold it (long ways) the height of a AAA battery PLUS about 1/16th inch higher (aprox. 2mm). Roll that aluminum &ldquo;battery&rdquo; up into the rough shape of a AAA battery. Put the aluminum &ldquo;battery&rdquo; in one of the two slots and place two real batteries in the other slots. Still too bright? Make another aluminum &ldquo;battery&rdquo; and run the contraption on just one real battery. P.S. Also works on remote controls.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-have-an-ereader-without-a-light">If you have an ereader without a light,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted a review in a long time, but this definitely warrants it. I would say its the best under 20 dollar purchase I have ever made. I read a lot and I have a Nook Simple Touch ereader. I thought about upgrading to get the one with the light, but there is no reason to. Mine works perfectly and I would actually lose some features that I like, such as the side buttons and no memory card.But on to the light. Uses 3 AAA batteries. I put Eneloops rechargeables in mine. Left it on over night and woke up light still shining bright. Good stuff. Light is bright and even. I tilt mine slightly off edge to the side and there is no hot spot or halo on the screen. Just even brightness. It has two brightness settings but the lower intensity is plenty fine for me. I have no idea why I waited years to buy one. Love the light, keeps me from using a light bulb that heats up my room when reading at night!I will be posting a picture as well. Hope this review keeps you outa the dark!</p>

<h5 id="great-little-light">Great little light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used a couple of other Kindle lights and this is my favorite so far.Two levels of illumination allow me to choose which I prefer. The spring mechanism snugs my Kindle keyboard model at just the right pressure and angle, and the flexible arm for the light works well and stays put. And even with three AAA batteries installed it&rsquo;s still a pretty light affair.I don&rsquo;t get what the blue velcro strip is for, though. Just a freebie gift? I think so.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-good-as-i-hoped">Not as good as I hoped.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using this for a 4th gen Kindle. It gets the job done but the back of the unit does not sit flush with the back of the kindle. And either because of or in addition to this it is kind of wobbly. You have to hold onto the light or it will fall off unless you are very vertical or very still. I was debating between the iKross and a standard clip on style book light. This one in particular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009T2FQ4/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_7?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009T2FQ4/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_7?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER</a> The Mighty Bright 50410 XtraFlex LED Music StandI decided to go with the iKross for whatever reason, I can&rsquo;t remember right now. But in all honesty I regret purchasing it and if I could go back would have probably bought the Mighty Bright. I still give it three stars because I think it would work fine on a thicker device. I bought it knowing that my kindle was a little thin for it(I think I saw it mentioned on another review). I&rsquo;m thinking of maybe putting some thicker foam padding on top of the existing foam padding. This might give a tighter fit that will at least keep it from falling off. If I do such a thing I will give an update to this review.</p>

<h5 id="light">Light</h5>
