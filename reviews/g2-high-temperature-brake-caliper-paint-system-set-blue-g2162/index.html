<li>G2 High Temperature Brake Caliper Paint System Set</li>
<li>G2 is available in 11 standard, high-gloss, wear-resistant colors</li>
<li>This top-of-the-line BRAKE Caliper Paint System Set from G2</li>
<li>The most complete and easy-to-use kit available and includes everything necessary for application</li>

<li><p>Not only is the G2 system attractive, but it offers great chemical and physical protection</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>G2™ has specially contracted chemical engineers to research and develop our two-part paint which now offers the highest heat resistance on the DIY aftermarket (up to 980 degrees). Easily applied as a brush-on, the paint adds a great styling touch to any brake caliper ultimately highlighting already stylish show-through rims. The G2 BRAKE Caliper Paint System™ has many advantages over spray-type paint because it will not flake, and it dries much harder than any rattle-can product.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-results">Excellent results</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What I like:+ Simple to use+ Large can of brake clean+ Good looking end resultWhat I don&rsquo;t:- Included paint brush is worthless- It is pretty expensive for paint- Foam packing peanutsFairly simple well packed kit, paint, hardener, crappy paintbrush, decals and a lots of little messy foam peanuts.Please keep in mind that this G2 Paint Kit only only one part of the entire painting process (the other is labor). If you&rsquo;ve ever painted anything half decent you&rsquo;ll know that to get good looking results you want to put a lot of effort into preparation. What this means if you&rsquo;ll want to take your time getting your caliper surfaces spotless to give the paint a good surface to bond to. The kit includes a fairly large can of brake clean to help you do just that. You&rsquo;ll want to take a 3M Scotch Brite Heavy Duty Pad (not included) and work it until the metal is spotless. My calipers went from a graphite gray to stainless steel gray after a few brake clean / scrub cycles. If you don&rsquo;t do this well you risk having paint flake off in the future forcing you to redo the work.Important note: Use proper respiratory protection, brake dust is nasty and you&rsquo;ll be kicking it up while cleaning and you certainly don&rsquo;t want to breath it in. I used a 3M N95 (not included) particulate mask but recommend considering something stronger since the fumes from the solvents (brake clean + G2 paint) had me feeling pretty nauseous by the end of the experience.Once you&rsquo;ve cleaned and optionally masked your surfaces you get to the fun part; painting. Pour the entire little jar of hardener into the G2 paint, shake vinously and wait for it to bubble and start applying. This starts a count down timer and leaving you with only 3 hours to finish. You should finish with plenty of time since you will probably spend a little over an hour coating all four corners (2 - 3 times). I <em>highly</em> recommend buying quality paint brushes because as soon as the hardener is mixed in with the paint it rapidly starts turning viscous and sticky the little paint brush that is supplied is poorly made and will not hold up as it gets thicker and stickier. I used some Behr&rsquo;s nylon paint brushes (not included) to give thin even coats.The first coat of G2 is one of the most important and you should definitely heed the instructions and apply a thin coat. The instructions say to leave 15 minutes between coats for drying time. This should be perfect for you to go around and paint the three other calipers and come back and do another coat. You can use a slightly heavier second coat to fill in gaps in coverage. I let the second coat sit for a little bit longer and while the paint claimed to be self-leveling there were tiny ridges / rivers. I took a 3M 150 grit sanding block (not included) and smoothed those out. I added one additional thin coat to this and according to the instructions you&rsquo;re done. If you have decals this would be a good time to add them in. Otherwise the wait 2 hours and put your wheels back on. If you purchased scotch brite pads like me for prep you might as well take one (not the same one soaked in solvent b/c brake clean will damage OEM clear coat) and clean the inside of the rims; clean rims help reflect light / glow that will enhance your freshly painted calipers. :)Important note: the instructions state you should give it 24 hours time to cure before driving, plan accordingly.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-blue-when-dry-not-purple">It&rsquo;s BLUE when dry! Not purple.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FIRSTLY - it does look purple in the can, it dries blue, I&rsquo;ll post after pics. This is an obvious concern, and a few reviews here made me sketchy. Wet paint and dry paint don&rsquo;t always look the same people, especially when it&rsquo;s special purpose paint with add-in activators.I used this a 2004 Mustang with Sonic Blue paint (one of the pics has part of the car in it so you can see the compare of the blues for reference). G2 will send you a color swatch free in the mail from their site btw, that&rsquo;s what I did. I also copied it from thier site and used Photoshop to place it on a pic of my car to give me an idea how it&rsquo;d look.Got the package promptly, inspected it. It was packed like crap but unbroken. In the product box you&rsquo;ll find -A spray can of brake cleanerCan of paint, a little more than half full, this is so you have slush and mixing room.A glass vial of activatorA paint brush. Brush itself isn&rsquo;t bad quality, but way to small for this use, it would take you all day!A Popsicle stick mixer, works fine.InstructionsOther things you&rsquo;ll need and/or want -Better brushes! I got 1 inch wood chip brushes locally for $7 cents each, I got several. These worked well, but be careful as the bristles come out easily and stick to the paint. I also got some smaller detail brushes for the little spot the bigger brushes couldn&rsquo;t hit.Tape, I used Scotch Blue Painters tape, worked great.Gloves, masks.A can of brake cleaner, just in case. I&rsquo;m sure the one they give you will be enough if all you&rsquo;re doing is calipers. I think I went through about 1.54 cans. I actually used some Brakleen I already had on hand.PATIENCE! Seriously, take your time on the cleaning part, it&rsquo;ll be worth it!Can&rsquo;t thing of anything else I used that was specifically caliper paint related.Here&rsquo;s how I did this&hellip;Read the instructions.Put the car up on stands. The paint is only good for a few hours after you mix it so you can&rsquo;t really do one caliper at a time.I was painting my rotors, dust shields and wheels as well on this project, so I took the calipers off the car.I did not disconnect the lines, just placed them on boxes under the wheel well.Cleaned everything on the car extremely well, steel brushing, sanding, steel wool, spraying, etc.Since the calipers were off, I didn&rsquo;t worry about taping anything off for that part. (I taped and placed cals under paper when spraying the shields)Read the instructions - again!Mixed the paint and activator in can using the popsicle stick.NOTES on color - IT LOOKS PURPLE IN THE CAN!!! It DOES turn blue as it dries, I&rsquo;ll post after pics.Paint time! I did one light coat all around. I took time, about ten minutes from start to reach the first caliper again, which is the coat time, perfect.Second coat was a little heavier, filled in gaps missed on first coat.Third coat, about the same heaviness of second, any heavier you&rsquo;d have runs and dripping.Fourth, and final, coat. By this time, it was clearly blue in color.Three coats probably would have been fine. There&rsquo;s plenty of paint for more though, probably could&rsquo;ve gotten a fifth still.Since I bought a ton of those 1 inch brushes, I&rsquo;d used a new one for each coat.Allow to dry overnight before use.Since I still had the rest of project to do, it was actually 2 days before I put anything together again.Pay attention to your weather too. I started this in the morning, but being in San Diego, it got real hot, real fast. I did the whole project in about a week as a result of the heat and sun.I put everything back together, wiped some grease of the calipers - that was awesome, it just wiped off cleanly with a towel!I choose to add a &ldquo;Mustang&rdquo; decal to my calipers, this would be the time to do so if you choose (for your car of course).Remember to push your brake pedal a couple times before drive off. Enjoy!There are tons of vids available for this, I watched a few, learned a little :)Also of note, I did smell some paint burning when driving the first few days, especially when braking hard. Not sure it this was the caliper paint or the rotors, or the heat/dust shield (I used a different black caliper spray paint and high heat spray paint paint for those).I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this product if you want a little extra class on your ride. It&rsquo;s been only a couple weeks since I applied it, but it still looks great! It&rsquo;s comes out a glossy medium blue. G2 also sells color coded paint too, for twice the price.</p>

<h5 id="the-color-looks-absolutely-nothing-like-the-image-shown">The color looks absolutely nothing like the image shown</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure how people ended up with blue, I followed the instructions correctly and let it cure for 24 hours but it still came out a light purple not blue. I contacted G2 and was asked to send in pictures of it. I was then told that was the correct color, I even had a sample of the color shipped to my home and to my surprise it was also not blue. I am not sure how the person who submitted the blue lexus image was able to obtain that color, as I also sumbitted that image to G2 and was told that, that certain color was a custom order color.The color looks absolutely nothing like the image shown. I tried to contact the seller Car-Accessories they asked I send in pics as well, sent it to them multiple times but was given the run around. Not sure why they choose to use a false image.Simply put do not buy this and expect it to be &ldquo;blue&rdquo;! You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<h5 id="best-caliper-paint">Best caliper paint</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This paint for the calipers is the best on the market. I was able to have enough paint to do three coats on all four calipers. The paint has held up for three years. I had to order more paint because the repair shop chipped a good amout off installing my new rims. I live on the east coast where winters can be brutal on cars but the paint has held up under all conditions so this is why I recommend this paint.</p>

<h5 id="wow-really-makes-the-wheels-pop">Wow! Really makes the wheels pop!</h5>

<p>The G2 caliper paint kit was a breeze to use! The color was a perfect blue for my sons Camaro Gen 6. The results are in the prep work!</p>
