<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for gifts to friends and family.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little flashlights! Hubby loves them!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine-but-it-a-little-weird">Works fine, but it a little weird.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a fan of cheap flashlights, these Aukeys do some things really well, but don&rsquo;t totally follow through with the execution.The flashlights themselves look realy cool and well machined. The focus feature is smooth and the lens is clear. I&rsquo;m also surprised that no matter what mode you turned it off in, if you leave it off for a few seconds, it restarts again in high beam. That&rsquo;s a feature common in much more expensive lights.The downside is that my black flashlight had a stray metal shaving in the switch base that kept the dust cover from seating until I removed it. Also, the switch is so deep you have to work to turn it on and off. There&rsquo;s no hole for a lanyard either, which is kind&rsquo;ve essential in these tiny flashlights. Usually there&rsquo;s a groove on the back of the flashlight to allow reversing the pocket clip. The Aukey has plenty of grooves in back, but none fit the clip. The weirdest aspect of this light is that the battery compartment has an O-ring, but the lens parts are completely unsealed. Other than keeping battery cover from falling off, why bother sealing any part of it?Aukey is about 80% of the way to making a great flashlight. It&rsquo;s much nicer looking and more compact than alot of the AA flashlights on Amazon. They just need to refine their product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointing">Very disappointing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already own an AUKEY LC90. That is a great light with excellent build quality. I was expecting similar quality with these lights, despite the great price. With that in mind, I bought two sets. After I received them, I immediately noticed a few things. In both boxes, there is a distinct difference in quality between the grey and black lights. The gray light is brighter and has a better switch. The black light often switches into the strobe mode for no particular reason and is noticeably dimmer. The grey light is still cheaper quality that I had hoped. I wish that AUKEY had tried to create a better simple light rather than putting the extra effort into making these light zoom, which they do poorly. A better LED, lens, and button without the zoom would have made these much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-flashlight-was-doa">one flashlight was DOA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Gray flashlight works OK. Black flashlight was DOA. Company gave me a prompt refund.2 stars for quality + 1 extra star for giving me a full refund even though only one light was bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="convenient-and-more-useful-than-your-phone">Convenient and more useful than your phone&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Found a great deal on these and bought 4-one for me and the rest for the purses of some friends who were thrilled. Cell phone flashlight wear down the phone battery quickly and do not have the range and power options.They seem well made at their price point and I use mine just about every day. I like the use of common batteries instead of the specialty batteries many this size use.Not blindingly bright but does its intended purpose well. Of course, I dropped mine on the garage floor but no damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-when-on-sale">Okay when on sale</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Both will not function reliably&ndash;the light will not switch on or switch modes at every button press and half press. Sometimes, they will recover and turn on if left alone but it works better to ensure they&rsquo;re off and leave them alone for 10 seconds before continuing to use them.They take longer to switch modes after a couple of quick rounds. Turning them off for a about 10 seconds resolves this as well.They do not function well with batteries that are towards the end of their life unlike incandescent flashlights.The grey one rattles without a battery in place. It also has a reddish light on the circumference.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-light-at-excellent-value">Excellent light at excellent value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Aukey has a solid history of producing quality electronics at a decent price. These lights are no exception. They are well built and priced much lower than competitive models. They&rsquo;re very bright, easily exceeding the advertised lumen rating. Increasing or decreasing the focus is simple. The light is compact, smaller than similar Cree LED AA lights. The pocket clip is easily removed if you want to slim it down even more. It fits easily in a pocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-quality">Decent quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well built, aluminum body, O-ring on battery cap, all feel very solid. Amazing for such a low price. Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-buy">Excellent buy!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love these flashlights. They are small enough to carry in my purse, has a clip to keep it in place and have a hugely bright light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="rock-solid">Rock Solid.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These have a much more solid feel than I expected. Light is bright and has held up well to normal use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-battery-life-also-seems-to-be-good-so-far">The battery life also seems to be good so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Work as expected and are very bright. The battery life also seems to be good so far! Great thing to keep in your glovebox or your purse since they are so small.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value for some very solid flashlights.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-flashlights">good quality flashlights</h5>
