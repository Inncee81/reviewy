#4 Perform the replacement under a electro-static discharge (ESD) free environment. Wear a anti-static wrist strap or put a anti-static mat on the working table to prevent any ESD damage on your phone device.White and zebra strip lines sometimes results because of ESD as well.If you are not confident about that, we suggest you to locate a repair shop at your neighbourhood.

<h5 id="the-screen-works-well-but-there-are-several-issues">The screen works well, but there are several issues &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen works well, but there are several issues&hellip;First of all, the screen arrived with fingerprints all over the metal housing on the back (picture is attached), so obviously it was not a new item, they sent me a return.Second of all, the proximity sensor does not function with this replacement. This means that when you are on a phone call, the phone will not turn off the touch screen so that your face doesn&rsquo;t dial buttons while you talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-but">Great product, BUT&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this screen to do a replacement on my daughter&rsquo;s phone, and I do love the all-in-one part for sure. I didn&rsquo;t have to remove the home button or the camera and have to keep up with tons of little parts, it was just a switch out of the screen, and VOILA! However, I&rsquo;m giving this only three stars because there is a defect in the screen at the upper left, and the light from the digitizer shines through the black screen. It&rsquo;s really only annoying, and I hope it doesn&rsquo;t mean there is a weakness in the screen that might become a problem later. I considered sending it back and getting a new one, but that would mean my daughter wouldn&rsquo;t have her phone until the exchange took place. I&rsquo;ll post a picture or two of the defect. It&rsquo;s barely noticeable, but when I replace a screen, I prefer for it to be as close to perfect as possible. Anyway, otherwise it works great and was an easy swap.</p>

<h5 id="please-read-don-t-purchase">PLEASE READ!! DON&rsquo;T PURCHASE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PLEASE READ!! DON&rsquo;T PURCHASE. When I was reading reviews for this product and saw that many people had received &ldquo;used&rdquo; products I thought it was just some rare occurrences. When I got the screen it was out of the box and the sucky cup(btw was so old and used it couldnt suck up the screen) had sometime of residue on it that just proved it had been used before. GROSS. The screen was in good shape but the one of the digitizers that is highly important was taped on very unprofessionally. The digitizer also did not have the padding it should have if you check your iphone. All in all I tried to get it to work, I followed all the directions but it DIDNT WORK. I am guessing it is due to the ripped digitizer that was provided to me. When I clicked on the screen with no crazy strength it broke. Please do yourself a favor and take this review seriously because even if the repair ends up working your screen will break very easily. NOT WORTH IT.</p>

<h5 id="5-stars-excellent-service-easy-to-install-thorough-review">[5 STARS] EXCELLENT SERVICE. EASY TO INSTALL. THOROUGH REVIEW.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>[5 STARS] This overall is a great product, everything on the photos came together. Although the tools were <em>NOT</em> Inside the box with the screen, they were still in the packaging. Great service, no problems or marks or any damage to the screen. I took off my old cracked screen off my iPhone5c and put this new Screen on, and everything ran smoothly. No weird marks or anything wrong with the LCD or Digitizer.P.S &ldquo;The Screen has a screen protector on it, to prevent dust and marks while installing, You can peel it off :)&ldquo;The picture I have provided, The Left is my iPhone 5c with the new screen. Right is the old cracked screen.I have fingerprints on the new LCD, btw.</p>

<h5 id="installed-it-and-now-my-iphone-stuck-in-boot-loop">Installed it and now my iphone stuck in boot loop &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed it and now my iphone stuck in boot loop, have to repeatedly hard reset and try putting it into safe mode to get it to boot out of it. Don&rsquo;t buy!!!!!OK&hellip;I must edit this review from 1 star to 2 star. For price it def is good deal&ndash;Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the camera causes your iphone to get stuck in a boot loop though. After 2 week headache trying to find a solution for why iphone would not boot (boot after spending an hour hard resetting and trying to boot in safemode) I figured out the camera was causing my phone to get stuck in a boot loop. If you get a 4013 error or get stuck in boot loop from this product it is either the camera or the proximity sensor. Best advice is try booting device without camera or proximity sensor attached to motherboard while iphone open, if boots then it is one of them. You can either keep ribbon disconnected and lose hardware benefits in iphone function or install hardware (camera/ proximity sensor) from old screen.If this happens to you best of luck hope this helps!!</p>

<h5 id="complete-crap">Complete crap!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Complete crap! I installed it and it didn&rsquo;t work at all. Also, when I opened the package the first time the item appeared to be used. Fingerprints on the metal, even marker drawn on one part. I wanted to do an exchange but because the item wasn&rsquo;t sold by amazon I had to return the first one and place a separate order for another one. Even though it was only 2 days after my original order I had to pay $4 more! BS.</p>

<h5 id="bad-quality-connector-do-not-waste-your-money">BAD QUALITY CONNECTOR, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a friend who fixes anything electronic. He has done (no bs) thousands of iphone screens, computers, tablets, you name it he could fix it. When he went to put this screen on the connection did not want to click in right, and when he finally got it, i went to turn my phone on and it lit up&hellip;&hellip;.but then the touch screen itself did not work. He took it apart again and put it back together and nothing worked on my phone. I am disappointed that this screen was a waste of my money and i ended up buying another one and it worked PERFECTLY FINE. BEWARE OF SELLER. Just because this product has had a couple good reviews and is priced higher than normal, the quality where it needed to be, was just not there.P.S I am never one to write bad reviews, but when i spent $40 for absolutely nothing i need to let the people be aware of the product they could potentially get.</p>
