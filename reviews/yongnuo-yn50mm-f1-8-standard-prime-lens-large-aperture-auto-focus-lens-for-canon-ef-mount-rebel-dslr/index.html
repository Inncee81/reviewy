<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>YONGNUO YN50mm F1.8 Standard Prime Lens Large Aperture Auto Focus Lens For Canon EF Mount Rebel DSLR CameraLove this lens. It arrived last week and I tried it out right away with a senior portrait shoot and used it the entire time, despite having an 85mm 1.8 in my bag as well. I&rsquo;m obsessed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="remove-the-protective-stickers-before-drawing-any-conclusions-on-this-lens">Remove the protective stickers before drawing any conclusions on this lens!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first I was disappointed in this lens as it seemed to lack heavily in the sharpness department and it seemed to hunt for focus. However, I soon discovered the manufacturer had placed a protective plastic sticker over the inside element of the lens (the glass closest to the sensor) that I had not seen. One I removed this sticker the performance of the lens was just I had expected from reading up on it on the photo sites- excellent! I wouldn&rsquo;t pay more than $60 for this lens because anymore than that and you could just get the canon version but for the $40-$60 range this lens performs exceedingly well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-lens">Great lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical at first about this lens since it is significantly cheaper than the canon version ($125). I am new to the DSLR world, and just purchased my first (canon rebel t5). I wanted the coveted &ldquo;nifty fifty&rdquo; lens as my first addition to the kit lens, but really couldnt afford the price tag. I gave the Yongnuo a try, thinking I would return it if I wasnt satsified (thanks Amazon Prime for making returns so easy). I was pleasantly surprised though, the quality of the pics produced are great, and this lens was exactly what I was looking for. It has many great reviews on Amazon, and other sites&hellip;definately worth saving money and choosing this over the canon for you hobby photography toolbox.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-a-perfect-lens-but-very-hard-to-beat-for-the-money">Not a perfect lens, but very hard to beat for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My copy is moderately sharp wide open and has a really nice bokeh. Build quality is similar to the older Canon &ldquo;nifty-fifty&rdquo;, which is to say flimsy plastic. Sturdy enough, I suppose. But considering this lens is about $50, and the image quality is very similar to the Canon (non-STM), it&rsquo;s a really hard to beat value, especially for beginners wanting to get a taste for prime lenses or as a nice cheap all-around option for a second or third SLR body.I think the newer Canon 50mm f/1.8 (STM version) is a better lens, but it&rsquo;s 2.5x the cost of the Yongnuo. For budget shooting, there probably isn&rsquo;t a better lens than this one.My only gripe (so far) is that the lens is shipped from the factory with plastic static stickers on both front and rear elements, and they are difficult to remove without tweezers. This opens up an opportunity to scratch or otherwise mar the front or back lens elements before you even get to use it. I&rsquo;m all for protection during packing and shipping, but they should have made the protective plastic easier to remove.</p>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ok piece of glass at an amazing price. Autofocus is very noisy and takes forever, but I got what I paid for. Here&rsquo;s some unedited photos taken with the lens at a party last night.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-50-i-ve-spent-to-improve-my-photography">Best $50 I&rsquo;ve spent to improve my photography.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Vast improvement from my kit lens. Great for portraits. I use this for photographing my clients&rsquo; portraits, and they come out pretty nicely. It&rsquo;s tempting to use the 1.8f stop, but that&rsquo;s only really best in few situations. Mostly I shoot in the 2.3 to 2.5 range depending on the subject. It&rsquo;s good to have that nice open aperture with slightly lower light conditions. Makes me want to get a better camera than my 7 year old Canon Rebel T1i so I can take even better pictures&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stop-agonizing-and-buy-this-lens">Stop Agonizing and BUY THIS LENS!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lens is my favorite in my collection and works amazingly well on my Rebel XT. I thank myself repeatedly for purchasing this when I get a shot that just blows my little mind. If you are really agonizing over purchasing this or the real Canon 50mm equivalent lens like I did for months, stop mistreating yourself now. Order this lens ASAP and stop punishing yourself for NOT buying a Canon lens. You&rsquo;re worthy and the first time you see what you captured, in all its detail, your smile will remind you that you did a great job.The quality of photos you will get for a mid-$50 lens will quickly put your mind to rest. Seriously. I could really care less that the lens is &ldquo;lesser quailty built&rdquo; than the Canon version. I do not purposely endanger my equipment because I need it and I do not have a backup. This is not a pro lens and I would expect that for $50 there has to be more plastic than metal. If anything, to me, this is a starter lens to evaluate what one can produce with this focal length and evaluate if you want to get the better built one from Canon. When you put this lens on, you probably will be like me and leave it on a majority of the time because it is a great walk-around lens and also delivers awesome portrait shots.The only problem I ever had was one time it would not auto-focus shortly after my purchase. Not sure what happened, but I removed it carefully, slid the switch for manual/auto a few times, re-mounted it and it was fine. It hasn&rsquo;t happened since.Also, it&rsquo;s a prime lens so you will have to make the mental change that there is not a zoom capability in the lens and you must physically get closer to subjects, or move further away. Some people may not understand this at first, or may not be able to physically move. So if you are looking for a zoom built-in, this lens does not offer that capability.Finally, make sure you remove all clear plastic lens covers before you begin to use the lens! The plastic on the internal side was a bit of a hassle to remove with larger fingers in action and I almost did not see it on the glass at first.Hope my words helped you and maybe even persuaded you to get off the fence and just buy it. I am very happy with mine and it&rsquo;s been on my camera almost exclusively for 5 months now.</p>
