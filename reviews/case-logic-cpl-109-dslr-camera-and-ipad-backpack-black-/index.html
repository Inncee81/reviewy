<h5 id="an-excellent-dedicated-camera-bag">An excellent dedicated camera bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the longest I have ever struggled with such a seemingly insignificant item. I must have looked at 30 different bags on Amazon. This one seemed very intriguing because of its small size. I wanted something that was 100% dedicated to camera stuff and nothing else. I have a few large backpacking bags that I use for travel as well as pelican cases for my cameras.I did not have something that I felt was a good method to carry my camera and lenses in regularly. I have my D7200 body, 35mm f/1.8, 18-140mm kit lens, and Tokina 11-16mm wide angle in this bag. The body and all three lenses will fit in the lower compartment as long as I do not have a lens on the camera. With the kit lens or the wide angle lens on the camera I just move the little fixed 35mm into the upper pocket. This still leaves plenty of room for keys and a phone plus some snacks.If you want an all around bag I think something larger would be best but this is a dedicated camera bag and as a result I don&rsquo;t mind having to carry this along with something else depending on the day.The only downside is that it does not have a way to carry my tripod. I am going to sew some straps to the underside to fix that, however.</p>

<h5 id="makes-it-possible-to-take-a-bulky-dslr-on-vacation">Makes it possible to take a bulky DSLR on vacation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this camera bag. I recently purchased this bag to take on vacation.So many times I leave my camera at home because the DSLR is too bulky. This time I was determined to take my camera on vacation and take some great photos.I was attracted to this camera backpack because it seemed spacious enough to carry the camera and accessories, while still leaving room for other stuff.It turned out to be a good decision (in fact, throughout the whole trip I kept commenting this bag was probably the best thing I bought for the vacation).Pros:• plenty of space in lower camera compartment for DSLR with 55mm to 200mm lens attached, charger with extra battery, and smaller kit lens.• little velcro stops on lower compartment to allow you to unzip the bag just enough to take out the camera without opening the whole comparment - meaning that the extra lens and battery stay put and don&rsquo;t fall out.• side opening makes it easy for you to extract the camera with bag still on one shoulder• the extra side zip pocket fits an iPad or kindle which was great for a trip to the beach• top compartment is deep and surprisingly spacious for what it is - it easily accommodated a few snack bars, my wallet, sunscreen, and sunglasses• I actually needed to use the weatherproof cover when we got caught in a sudden drizzle while outside and away from our hotelCons• you have to be careful to close the side zips on the iPad/Kindle/device pocket and the camera compartment. If you accidentally leave them open your precious equipment could fall out and result in a costly mistakeOverall, I loved the compact footprint of this bag. It made it easy for me to take a bulky camera on vacation because I could use the bag for both the camera and other items too.</p>

<h5 id="great-case-for-traveling-light-with-a-dslr">Great case for traveling light with a DSLR</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this backpack and I already love it. It&rsquo;s the perfect size for my small frame (around 5&rsquo;3) and my Canon DSLR with 24-105mm lenses on fits neatly inside. There&rsquo;s customizable compartments inside the bottom half thanks to velcro that could fit a small lens or extra battery. I was wondering where the weather hood was- turns out it&rsquo;s inside a small slit on the bottom along the back panel. There&rsquo;s even two little velcro &ldquo;locks&rdquo; for the zipper on the outside of the bottom half. This would prevent you from unzipping too much and opening the bottom compartment easily. Basically if you want to travel light and discreetly carry a heavy camera around but don&rsquo;t have a ton of camera equipment, this is a great case for you.</p>

<h5 id="compact-and-convenient-lightweight-and-comfortable-with-capacity-limitations">Compact and convenient, lightweight and comfortable, with capacity limitations.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this backpack. Small lighweight and perfect for a single camera body with standard lens 18mm - 55mm and a spare lens in 55mm - 300mm range. I Use it with a Nikon D5500 and the two lenses stated above. Keep in mind its a small compact bag, not really designed for much else above and beyond the amount of gear I have stated here. You can squeeze in a few minor accesories but not much. I wouldnt class it as a backpack in the true sense, its a compact camera bag about half the size of a standard backpack. Its beauty is its small size, its drawback its its small size, so really depends what you need it for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-gopro">Perfect for GoPro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for my GoPro and all it&rsquo;s attachments and it works perfectly. Here&rsquo;s why I chose this one over other bags:- I needed a built in rain cover to protect any other items I put in the bag like my phone and wallet- Has a tablet pocket; this is great for reviewing/posting video on the go- Has a chest strap; great for mounting GoPro- Small pocket; great for storing my phone and wallet- Light weight; I didn&rsquo;t want a bag bouncing around while on my adventure- Entire case is padded; not just the camera compartment- Very inexpensive compared to other bags I was looking at that didn&rsquo;t have the features this one hadThe only thing I thought was missing from this bag is straps for a tripod or pole. I just made sure the telescopic pole I bought could fold small enough to fit in the bag. Overall I&rsquo;m extremely pleased with the bag for my use.</p>

<h5 id="i-seriously-love-this-bag">I seriously love this bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I seriously love this bag. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a camera bag that wasn&rsquo;t super big and heavy for trips and hiking and this is it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-small">Great but small</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bag. I love the ease of use and the compactness. Yet, I regret the purchase slightly. I have a Nikon D3200 with a standard kit 18-55mm lens and a Tameron 150-300mm lens plus&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="didn-t-like-it-when-i-got-it-from-the-point-of">Didn&rsquo;t like it when I got it from the point of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t like it when I got it from the point of view of size. It was surprisingly small. I expected a bigger bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an Olympus OM-D EM10, and paired it with a 75-300 M.Zuiko lens. It&rsquo;s a tight fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bag">Great bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Canon rebel plus 2 lenses. Needed something for travel. I didn&rsquo;t want to carry a purse and camera bag. Too much to keep track of. This was perfect combo.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality">Excellent quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality and I appreciate the extra zipper pockets!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-side-compartment-zip-design-pain">Poor &lsquo;side compartment&rsquo; zip design = pain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This bag must have a design fault. I&rsquo;ve had two and, on both, the side compartment that provides quick access has a bad zip design. Meaning quick access becomes slow access.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-case">Nice case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wish top compartment was double it&rsquo;s size</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-bag">I love this bag!</h5>

<p>This is the best DSLR bag I&rsquo;ve ever owned and I have four total bags in all shapes and sizes. Camera access is quick and convenient also there is room in the camera compartment&hellip;</p>
