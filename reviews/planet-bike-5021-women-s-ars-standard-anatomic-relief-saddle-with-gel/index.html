<h5 id="medium-distance-rider-love-this-seat">Medium distance rider - LOVE this seat.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really want to respond to some of the reviews I saw prior to buying the product. To be clear: I love this seat! I ride 9 miles round-trip daily to work and do weekend rides of 20-30 miles at a time.I chose this seat because the reviews for the men&rsquo;s seat were extraordinary! The women&rsquo;s were mixed. I&rsquo;d like to address just a couple things in this review:1) I wear a size 10 and am 147 lbs. I didn&rsquo;t experience any issues with the seat rubbing. I have the nose pointed slightly down, so I really have no issues with the nose touching me at all.2) Some reviewers noted that this seat wasn&rsquo;t particularly &ldquo;cushy&rdquo; or &ldquo;gel&rdquo;-ly. It&rsquo;s not supposed to be cushy! That&rsquo;s what beach cruiser seats are for! The gel in this seat absorbs energy so that instead of the bike seat pushing up on you with the same amount of force that you exert on the seat by sitting on it (sorry for my high school physics language), you actually don&rsquo;t really feel much. Basically, on a 25 mile ride, I don&rsquo;t think about the seat. I don&rsquo;t have to wriggle around and stand up while riding to give my butt a break like I did on my old seat! Getting on and off of it after a 12 mile stretch doesn&rsquo;t cause me any soreness! It doesn&rsquo;t feel cushy like a nice armchair, but it also doesn&rsquo;t feel like much at all. Just a seat!It&rsquo;s lightweight for such a supportive seat (plus!) and it&rsquo;s contoured exactly right for a woman&rsquo;s body. I give my highest recommendation to this seat - if you want anything better, you CAN find it, but it will cost at least $10 more.</p>

<h5 id="a-nice-seat-at-a-very-decent-price">A nice seat at a very decent price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read all the reviews, before purchasing. I&rsquo;ve purchased a few bike seats, and I&rsquo;ve been disappointed. Prices range all over the place, and it&rsquo;s difficult to determine the level of comfort a seat has by the price. So I took a chance and purchased this seat. Some of the reviewers mentioned there is a short break-in period; I kept that in mind before making a judgment. I&rsquo;ve had the seat on my indoor bike for a couple of months now and It&rsquo;s getting better and better. So much so that I may even change out my expensive outdoor bike seat with one of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally swapped out my stock mountain bike (gel) seat today with this one. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;d make much of a difference, the stock seat is a little narrower, but otherwise similar looking. What a difference though! My rear end is so my happier. Switched bikes on our ride back and rode my old seat for a few miles, couldn&rsquo;t stay seated, too painful. Switched back to my bike with new seat, and no problem! For the price, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="immediately-painful">Immediately Painful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure if I&rsquo;m just shaped differently than everyone else (5&rsquo;1&rdquo;, 110 lbs.) but the minute I sat on this I was shocked at how the perimeter around the cutout portion dug painfully into my body. I&rsquo;ve been told I have narrow hips so maybe that&rsquo;s it. It felt like I was sitting on the opening of glass cup. I was very disappointed because I really like the way it looks and wanted to have the opening in the center for air circulation. I realized that I never feel pain on the Star Trak spin bike seats so I&rsquo;m hoping to find something like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-shape-decent-price-for-the-quality">Nice shape, decent price for the quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this bike seat to replace the old one that originally came with my bike. My old seat was perfectly fine for a year, then started feeling uncomfortable. After first trying out this new seat, it was hard to get used to and felt uncomfortable for my first few rides, yet still felt better than the old seat. Once I got used to the different shape of this seat, it was easy to forget about it. I no longer thought about the bike seat at all, and was able to focus more on my bike ride. I wouldn&rsquo;t say this bike seat is extremely comfortable, but it isn&rsquo;t designed to be in the first place. I really like the shape of this bike seat, how light it is, and the fact that you can adjust the angle of the nose. I have mine angled slightly downward and I think that helps a lot when riding up and down hills. Buy it and try it out!</p>

<h5 id="lifesaver">Lifesaver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This saddle has allowed me to stay on my bike longer than I could with the stock seat that the bike came with. I like the front to back tunnel which eases pressure on the body. Most seats in this price range do not have that feature. Pressure is taken off tender spots from front to back. It is adjustable from front to back once installed on the bike so if you like the front a little higher or lower it is easily accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-believe-i-waited-so-long-to-try-this">Can&rsquo;t believe I waited so long to try this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert bike rider and I&rsquo;ve always just used the bike seat that came with the bike (usually designed with a guy in mind). I am SO GLAD I decided to give a women&rsquo;s anatomic bike seat a try. It was weird and uncomfortable the first 2 days, but then my butt fell in love with it. This seat has radically elevated the joy of riding my bike.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="spin-bike-comfort">Spin bike comfort!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased a spin bike that I absolutely love, minus the terrible seat!! I had previously purchased a gel cover that is removable, which did help some, but I was still experiencing pressure and discomfort after riding for a very short duration (10 minutes or so). After checking to see that my spin bike post was the same as a regular bike&rsquo;s, I purchased this item and could not be happier. It was quick and easy to install. I know a lotof spin bikes require adapter kit to use a regular bike seat, so be sure to check yours before you make a purchase. I read so many reviews and am glad I went with one what is still on the small-medium size scale, rather than a larger, more padded one, as I don&rsquo;t think a larger seat would have been good for me. I am not a very big person, but am tall. This is so comfortable to use, and I don&rsquo;t stand up much on the bike so I am in contact with the seat pretty much my entire workout, which is about 45 minutes. Very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-really-like-it">I really really like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect for me. I used it in a ride of 26 miles and it was really comfortable. Just one recommendation, check if it is the right size for your sit bones before buy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-also-looks-like-a-second">it&rsquo;s also looks like a &lsquo;second&rsquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow&hellip;one of the most UNCOMFORTABLE bike seats ever. I took it for a test ride and found it&rsquo;s hard, and it cuts into my leg when pedaling.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="protect-your-lady-bits">Protect your lady bits</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great seat that is comfortable and no pressure on your privates. 30 mile bike ride and was very comfortable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-seat-reasonably-priced">Good seat, reasonably priced</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good seat, reasonably priced. Comfy - as much as a seat can be when you&rsquo;re riding 80+ miles a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ouch">Ouch!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For me it was painful to sit on. I sent it back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great seat. Medium firmness and not too bulky. Sits perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-pressure-points-on-this-seat-so-not-line-up">The pressure points on this seat so not line up &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The pressure points on this seat so not line up well and therefore causes pain. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; and 140 lbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife found it to be a great improvement over the stock saddle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended">Highly recommended.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wife loves this new seat. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-bike-seat">this is a great bike seat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is a great bike seat..I am not am not a small person and I was a bit worried when I seen how small this seat was when I opened it,but to my surprise it is pretty nice..</p>
