<h5 id="counterfeit-product-buyer-beware">Counterfeit product. Buyer beware!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE! Counterfeit product! When we tried to register this with Phillips, we found that it had a bogus product number, not starting with HHZ. If you get one with Chinese letters on it, send it back. A picture of the base with Chinese writing is now attached.</p>

<h5 id="cleans-significantly-better-than-a-manual-toothbrush-charge-lasts-3-weeks">- Cleans significantly better than a manual toothbrush - Charge lasts 3 weeks &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:- Cleans significantly better than a manual toothbrush- Charge lasts 3 weeks- Pulses to let you know when to move on to each section- Travel case is a big win. With my prior electric toothbrushes, I often ended up traveling with a manual just because I didn&rsquo;t have a convenient way to store the electric- Variety of modes is great for a whole spectrum of dental preferencesCons:- Like others have said, It&rsquo;s odd that you can&rsquo;t set the mode prior to turning it on and putting it in your mouth. It leads you to have to either count the number of times you push the button, or angle it so you can see the display in the mirror.- The instructions are very vague regarding the timer and quadrant pulses. I started with using the gum mode and thought I was following along switching quadrants every time it pulsed, but then found myself with an extra 4 or so pulses at the end that I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with. It would be nice if the instructions had a table that called out specifically when the pulses occur for each mode so we know when to move to the next section.- There&rsquo;s another model of sonicare that pulses when you push too hard. For the price of this one, I feel like it&rsquo;d be nice if it had that feature too.- The glass charger is neat and a convenient storage place, but I think I&rsquo;d prefer if it could stand straight up in its stand rather than let it lean against things.- The green charging indicator light is very dull and difficult to see in the daylight.</p>

<h5 id="super-sonic">Super Sonic💫</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this brand for many years. My last Sonicare burned out in less than a year and I dabbled in other electric brushes because I was over it, but Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean is the most POWERFUL and EFFECTIVE when it comes to deep cleaning &amp; whitening.WHY I GAVE PHILIPS ANOTHER CHANCEFree Extended Warranty• Free 2.6 year extended warranty buy simply keeping invoice &amp; registering at Sonicare.com/register. Now covered until 2020 (2 mins)• By registering warranty you receive 15% off Sonicare items from website w/ free shipping for 1 year• Con $20 mail in rebate is for only dental office purchases (in fine print)• Skip the warranty offered as they work with as well AT&amp;T and will leave you withouth your product for an extended amount of time.(I am trying to return 3 yr 19.99 warranty will update).• This made me more comfortable to repurchase. Since they are notorious of buring out after 1 year and I am now covered for almost 3 years. So, now worries now.About the Toothbrush:• It comes with 11 accessories/pieces to name a few; a travel charger &amp; a pedestal charger that the&rdquo;Charger Glass&rdquo; sits on in picture &amp; power adapter (2 ways to charge). I thought it was weird, but allows brush to dry and charge in a very non messy way (just clean glass).• Comes with 3 brush heads that all have different cleaning functions1. Super Plaque Removal2. New Adpative Brush included3. Whiter Brightening Brush4. All Philips brush heads fit• It has a mush slimmer &amp; not as bulky as past brushes by Philips which is so nice especially if you travel.• This pink is beautiful and soft• Intiatal charge is 24 hours. Long, but worth it.• Also comes with $50 off Zoom Whitening• 5 Brush modes for custom cleanThere are many knock offs of this brush and theu are not as powerful&hellip; They are so identical that you will feel compelled to try, but they burn our in 3-4 months with a 1 month warranty. Go with Philips. I will include a pic of a knock off you should stay away from (1 month warranty &amp; weak).All in All 5 Stars.Review Guaranteed to be updated.Update 30-June-2017The Asurion Protection Warranty for 19.99 is being refunded.Took awhile to hear back, yet refund will be credited in 3-5 business days.It is completely unnecessary with the Philip&rsquo;s warranty.• I have found the power button to be tough to turn on which the warranty from Philips will cover if it gets worse or stops working.• Still very satisfied with the brush&rsquo;s exceptional cleaning quality.15-Jul-3017With a lik peroxide teeth are back to bright white!</p>

<h5 id="this-toothbrush-is-a-beast">This toothbrush is a beast</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sonicare toothbrush is a work horse there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. If you inspect the back of your teeth you can usually see a small layer of plaque. Well the sonicare toothbrush is your answer to the best at home cleaning, after about 2 days of brushing my teeth were noticeably cleaner. My colleagues were asking me if I whitened my teeth lol, I can never go back to a manual toothbrush. 32,000 brush strokes a minute think about that. If you care about how your teeth look, then this is a great investment.</p>

<h5 id="was-concerned-the-reviews-were-misleading-and-i-wouldn-t-like-it-and-it-is-expensive-but">&hellip; was concerned the reviews were misleading and I wouldn&rsquo;t like it and it is expensive but</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was concerned the reviews were misleading and I wouldn&rsquo;t like it and it is expensive but&hellip; its awesome. I have a lot of fillings and sensitive teeth but it doesn&rsquo;t bother them at all. I was also having to use a gum treatment mouthwash which I have now been able to stop using. Great buy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="supreme-clean">Supreme Clean!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely worth every cent! My old Sonicare died after a long life so I couldn&rsquo;t wait to re-order for deep clean. Manual brushing just does not compare at all. Will always own if this one lasts as long as my first! Charging glass &amp; travel case are nice enhancements. Nothing bad yet.</p>
