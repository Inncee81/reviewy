<blockquote>
<p>Short Review: If you are in the market for some accessories for your new GoPro, don&rsquo;t hesitate to buy this product! This is the BEST bundle I could find at this price point.I am brand new to the GoPro, and I, like many others I&rsquo;m sure, was overwhelmed by the number of kits on Amazon. There are literally hundreds of kits claiming to be the best, but they all lacked something wanted. One would have everything but the monopod. Another would have it all except the floating hand grip. C&rsquo;mon! I was growing tired and on the verge of giving up on the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; kit when I discovered LifeLimit. They looked professional and seemed to include everything I wanted.The package arrived quickly and on-time. The contents come in a nice, blue bag (see pictures). The bag is a nice touch that many other bundles lacked. It&rsquo;s professional enough that I would take it out in public but also cheap enough that I won&rsquo;t be sad if I leave it somewhere one day. Ha!I opened it up to find the parts seperated into Ziploc bags, nice touch. As another reviewer noted, there is a hint of plastic-ish-sorta smell. It went away after a few hours of being out of the bag. No worries. Nothing was broken, and I was happy.I have since used every item in this kit and can say it&rsquo;s great! The suction cup mount is really strong and will make for some great shots in &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; places like your windshield or elsewhere. The head-strap is really nice. It WILL go large enough for your head, so don&rsquo;t get frustrated if it is way too small at first. The chest mount seems really nice and has worked well so far. It has various adjustments and will accommodate most body-types. The miscellaneous pieces including screws, mounts, and adhesive pads all work.The monopod is quite nice measuring at 8.5&rdquo; when fully collapsed and just shy of 43&rdquo; when fully extended. It is sturdy enough that I&rsquo;ll use it and trust it with my GoPro, but I won&rsquo;t be holding it off the edge of the Empire State Building. That&rsquo;s for sure. It does have a strap that you can put around your wrist for added safety, which is a nice touch. The floating hand grip is a wonderfully visible and floats at water level no problem. Like the monopod, it has a wrist strap for added safety. It feels secure. I&rsquo;ll be trusting it for sure. The handlebar mount is great and seems sturdy. It can be removed by taking out one screw, which is nice. There&rsquo;s also this clamp with nice teeth on it that might be really helpful to some. I used it to attach my camera to backpack strap when I don&rsquo;t feel like wearing a camera.Overall, this is a fantastic kit that will make anyone happy. It has everything you need to get &ldquo;started.&rdquo; I say that in quotes because you still need a Micro SD Card and some batteries and maybe a case, but you get what I mean!See attached pictures for full tour. There are simply too many products for one shot! Ha! If you have any questions, please ask them!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect package for everyone that owns a GoPro! If you need an accessory while driving a car, rock climbing, four wheeling, water skiing, mountain biking, and any other activity you want to film is in this one starter package. I have been extremely satisfied by the quality and durability of every item in this package. I would recommend this to everyone!</p>

<h5 id="great-value-lots-of-accessories">Great value, lots of accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this starter kit because I needed a selfie stick for my action camera and thought this was a great deal with all of the other accessories it comes with. The selfie stick works perfectly, but my favorite accessory is the octopus tripod. It allows me to prop my camera up to take pictures of myself with the family. The accessories are very durable.</p>

<h5 id="must-have-do-not-pass-it-up">Must have do not pass it up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best purchase I have made off Amazon. This kit honestly has everything you need for your Go pro. I was shocked at the quality and quantity of accessories you get especially at this price. I&rsquo;ve seen individual items go for almost the same price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-i-thought-it-was-a-great-buy-considering-the-price-and-quality">but I thought it was a great buy considering the price and quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first Amazon purchase. I bought this back in September 2015, so I had a bit of time using it. Having said that, I haven&rsquo;t used all the different mounts.I find that the most common item I have used is the chest harness mount, the head mount and the selfie stick found that came in quite handy when i went skiing. The items were received on time, were well packaged and contained all items as advertised and none of the items have been damaged after using it about 20 times so far. They feel to be made from quality material. It might not come packaged as the prettiest box with ribbons on top, but I thought it was a great buy considering the price and quality. Besides, most people I know throw the packaging away after they receive the item.its a win-win.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-bang-for-your-buck">Very good bang for your buck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit comes with a ton of different accessories, more than I will ever need. It is shipped in a nice drawstring bag that is helpful when carrying around everything. I&rsquo;ve tried several of the accessories out and they all seem very durable. They are all made out of plastic but definitely seem strong enough for typical activities you might use them for (hiking, boating, etc.). You might want to invest in stronger individual pieces if you were planning on using your Go Pro in harsher environments, but these more than enough for the tasks I needed them for.</p>

<p>This set really has inspired my son to take more pictures and wants to become a photographer. The stand was very convenient fell in love with everything, the products are all&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are so many goodies in this bag, it&rsquo;s like Christmas. I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t use them all&hellip; but nice to have all the options. Adhesive pads for mounting are very high quality.</p>
