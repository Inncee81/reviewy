<h5 id="this-little-boat-that-could">This little boat that could</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve waited a long time to review this boat because I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it was going to hold up. Well, now I know, and it&rsquo;s awesome. I take it out on the Chattahoochee river almost every weekend, and it&rsquo;s held up like a champ. I added a few enhancements to her, and she&rsquo;s turned into a pretty sweet boat for being an inflatable. It fits my dog and a fishing buddy no problem. I have both a 30lb and 40lb minn kota motor for it. I initially got the 30, and it works great for ponds and lakes, but I needed the 40lb to get me up stream on the river, which it does flawlessly. Highly recommend this boat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-to-be-exactly-what-i-wanted">Seems to be exactly what I wanted.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the size of this boat, it seems just right for my wife, me, and our 5-years-old grandson to use as we intend (mostly floating the river) without being hard to manage.I am going to run it through a series of tests and I&rsquo;ll update this as it passes or fails them.Update 07/14/14: To test it&rsquo;s ability to hold air, I inflated this boat and left it in the garage for five days&ndash;It lost only a small fraction of the air, slightly less percentage than our bicycles do in the same circumstances.After topping off the air with the included hand pump (fairly easy, about ten minutes for all three chambers and the seats, the next test was loading the boat onto the roof rack of a SUV for transport to the river launch site&ndash;with two adults this was very easy. I secured the boat and transported it twelve miles without a problem&mdash;it rode nicely on the rack.With two adults riding in it, the boat performed beautifully during the 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour float on the river&ndash;I easily guided it thru several sets of riffles and over basketball-sized rocks. I deliberately bounced it off rocks and dragged it onto sandy/rocky beaches and the concrete launch ramps. I removed the oars from the locks and used one paddle to maneuver the boat&mdash;very easy to maintain confident control.At the end of the trip, after careful inspection, I could find no damage.Deflation and repacking&ndash;After opening the Boston valves and the valve in the floor, I easily folded/rolled the boat into a package small enough to fit into the included bag&ndash;all in about 15 minutes. The whole package easily fit into our auto&rsquo;s trunk.The next day, we repeated the same, this time with three adults and a 5 year old child&ndash;the results were the same, but, after several hours, the boat seemed a bit crowded.All in all, I&rsquo;m very happy with this purchase&ndash;It was reasonable price (I paid about $122) for a great product that is a LOT of fun. I&rsquo;m raising my rating to 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="enjoying">Enjoying!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We took our maiden voyage along the American River this past weekend (7/25/15) and husband loved the raft (as well as our Rottie). Had a great time, no air leak issues, comfortable. Looking forward to hittin&rsquo; the lake tomorrow and another Rafting &ldquo;Expedition&rdquo; in August! Price was great, pump works better than the electric pump we have!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-on-a-bun">Fun on a bun!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best recreation purchases I&rsquo;ve ever made, and I&rsquo;ve made quite a few. I live in South Florida where there are no shortages of lakes, canals and various other waterways, so a boat like this is quite versatile.With its 36-pound thrust trolling motor it can cruise all day in silence (at a surprisingly nice speed). The boat&rsquo;s construction is sturdy and it has three separate air chambers, meaning it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to sink by misfortune.The cushions are comfortable and secure, but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of soft decking, which makes moving around the boat feel like walking on a waterbed, so I cut out a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; plywood the shape of the deck, coated it well on all sides with marine paint (to protect the wood) and carpeted the upper side with outdoor carpeting. It works great! I carry the plywood floor on my car&rsquo;s roof rack and tie it down with bungees.On a typical day&rsquo;s outing I simply toss the boat&rsquo;s carrying bag (which also holds both the hand and electric air pumps, not to mention two Coast Guard approved life vests) in my car&rsquo;s trunk, along with the trolling motor and motor mount (which I modified to hold the battery, night lighting and a 12-volt power source for iPods, phones and whatever), I stop at a deli on the way to the water and get sandwiches, snacks wine and/or beer and ice for the cooler, and we&rsquo;re ready to boat!I back my car down to the lake or canal (a ramp&rsquo;s handy but not necessary), unload the boat, motor and floor and inflate the boat with the electric pump, which plugs into the car&rsquo;s lighter. Inflation takes maybe twelve minutes, assembling the oars another two or three minutes. They stay clipped to the boat&rsquo;s sides until needed, which is rarely.I insert the floor, set the motor &amp; mount in the boat (along with whatever necessities we may have brought) then slide the boat into the water. My passenger boards and I tie off the boat to whatever&rsquo;s handy then move the car to a proper parking spot. All of this takes less than a half hour. Once in the boat, I attach the motor mount and motor and we&rsquo;re off!From here on it&rsquo;s just pure fun and lounging around, listening to classic rock and soaking in the rays. Whenever I take a passenger out for the first time, she&rsquo;s always amazed at how relaxing this type of boating can be. I&rsquo;ve owned boats of all sorts but pound for pound this simple little inflatable is worth its weight in gold.I recommend never boating drunk or otherwise impaired, always bring a life vest for each passenger and provide for some kind of night lighting, should the unexpected occur and you end up boating after dark. I also recommend an anchor, since inflatable boats drift easily in the wind. I use a 3.5-pound fold-up type anchor with 50 feet of <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; nylon rope, which takes up little space but works well (and also fits neatly in the boat&rsquo;s storage bag).Well, that&rsquo;s about all you need to know. I promise you&rsquo;ll never find this much fun and convenience in a boat for less money, and you won&rsquo;t need a garage or trailer to transport &amp; store it. What could be better? Okay, I admit I&rsquo;ve been thinking about installing a matching blue fold-down Bimini top (available here on Amazon), but that would just be icing on the cake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this for a weekend trip to a mountain lake and were surprised at how fun and awesome it was for the money. not a white water river raft but great for paddling around a lake for hours and shockingly easy to use. we even put it fully inflated on top of our little jeep for a few miles transport back to the cabin and threw it in another lake the next day and it held up great.</p>
