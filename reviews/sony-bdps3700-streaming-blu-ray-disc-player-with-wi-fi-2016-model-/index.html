<h5 id="one-major-flaw-on-an-otherwise-good-player">One major flaw on an otherwise good player.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One major flaw on an otherwise good player. This player works great&hellip;until your disc gets stuck in it. On two separate units, we had a problem where the &ldquo;child lock&rdquo; feature turns on and can&rsquo;t be turned off. This happened once, so we returned the player. It just happened again on a second machine. Now we&rsquo;ve lost two discs. Sony customer support was no help at all. All of the fixes were useless. You&rsquo;ll see several other posts noting the problem; it appears to be a serious problem with the unit that Sony can&rsquo;t solve. We&rsquo;ve tried the unlock process on the remote. We&rsquo;ve tried a power reset. We&rsquo;ve tried a firmware update. Nothing works. And, if we&rsquo;re batting 0/2 with this problem, on two completely different units,you can bet that there&rsquo;s a good chance your player will have this problem, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buyer beware. I purchased this item less than a month ago and the child lock cannot be disabled. Cannot open the disc tray.</p>

<h5 id="broken-would-give-zero-stars-if-it-were-an-option">BROKEN. Would give zero stars if it were an option.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We ordered this product and it worked great for 2 days. Then out of nowhere, it started telling us that the &ldquo;Child Lock&rdquo; was on, and would not allow us to open the disc tray. I followed the instruction manual to disable this function, and it gave me the message &ldquo;Child lock deactivated. You may now eject the disc tray&rdquo;. I pressed Eject and it told me that Child Lock was on.Thinking this was just a faulty device, we returned it to Amazon, who promptly sent us out a replacement. The replacement worked great for 2 days, and then, guess what, the same problem. A Child Lock feature would not allow us to open the disc tray and could not be turned off. The last movie we watched is now seemingly stuck in the tray forever.We will now return this device again and purchase a different product from a different manufacturer. Spend your money elsewhere, this device is not worth the headache.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-expected">Better than expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently I didn&rsquo;t read all of the description, and I didn&rsquo;t realize that I had to purchase the high speed hdmi cord separately. I didn&rsquo;t compare prices anywhere because I was in a hurry to get it set up. I ended up going to a local Dollar General store and bought one for $14. I later found out that they are sold on here for about $6. The instructions made me think that I needed the hdmi cord and a coaxial cable, but I didn&rsquo;t. The hdmi cord worked without the other one.With that being said, I am still very pleased with my purchase. There are plenty of apps to choose from. You can pick which ones you want listed under &ldquo;My Apps&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; or main screen. It&rsquo;s very easy to setup and use.The remote is small. It fits in my hand. It does come with batteries. It&rsquo;s simple to use.It connected to my wifi with ease.There is a feature called &ldquo;Screen Mirroring,&rdquo; which sounds awesome, but I was unable to get it to work. It could possibly be because I tried it with an iPhone but I&rsquo;m not completely sure. Basically, you&rsquo;re able to look at pictures from your phone on your tv, and it doesn&rsquo;t require any cords.Read all of the features and go ahead and order the hdmi cord (if you don&rsquo;t have one). Scroll down under the product. It should show up under the section where it says &lsquo;suggested purchase&rsquo; or &lsquo;other people also bought.&lsquo;This is my first day with it, so if anything changes, I&rsquo;ll update my review.</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-my-sony-bdps3700-except-for-the-small-remote">Very happy with my Sony BDPS3700 except for the small remote.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sony BDPS3700 Streaming Blu-Ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi (2016 Model)I bought this player in December of 2016. It is now July 2017. I still love this Blu-Ray Player and use it often. I&rsquo;m still glad I bought 2 of them.I&rsquo;ve been using this DVD player for a couple of weeks most every day. This weekend I watched the Sopranos on Blu-Ray disc after disc and the player performed without a hitch. Also, the Child Lock problem seems to be fixed on my unit. I&rsquo;ve done 3 updates to the player since I hooked it up. Being a Blu-Ray player means it is very important for it to be connected to the internet and to always keep it updated. It needs up to date Blu-Ray information to play the latest discs.The reason I took one star off the rating is because of the size of the remote. I have a hard time with the very small buttons. I have only had it for a couple of weeks but I don&rsquo;t think I will get any better at pushing the right buttons. I watch it in a dimly lit room and either need to turn a light on or use a flashlight to see the buttons. Also some of the buttons I use a lot are down toward the bottom of the remote which causes me to need to hold the remote with one hand and push the button with the other. I like some things being small but a remote isn&rsquo;t one of them.The player itself is very small. I don&rsquo;t mind that. It is the most minimalist unit I&rsquo;ve ever owned. There is an on/off button, eject and the DVD drawer and a USB connection. It has a small light on the front when it is on. Not distracting at all. The unit slides right under my Vizio TV which was very nice.The player reacts very fast to the commands from the remote. It also starts up very quickly if you turn on that option which I did. My other Toshiba DVD player is very slow at doing everything, although it has lasted for a long time and never has any problems. It is not Blu-Ray though.I bought two of these Sony players. One is in the same room as my wi-fi and the other is about 100 feet away in another room. Both of them connected to wi-fi without any problem. And they stay connected. There was a power outage Christmas morning and when the power came back I didn&rsquo;t need to do anything to reconnect them. I was impressed. Two of us can watch streaming content at the same time with our 50mb download speed. No buffering required.The home page that appears when you start the DVD player is simple and easy to navigate. My 88 year old mother doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any problems with it. Though she did complain about the small remote also. You can populate one side of the screen with your favorite streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu + or Amazon etc. You can also get YouTube which I like. There are music apps and a lot of others. Down at the bottom of the home page is where you can choose DVD plus two other options like USB input. I have not used the USB input.I know there are a lot of other things I could tell everyone about but these were the major things I&rsquo;ve noticed since I started using this player. I don&rsquo;t want to write a book but I hope this helps someone make a decision as to whether to buy it or not.So far I am very happy with it and would recommend it to my friends.</p>

<h5 id="defective-product">Defective product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is defective. It worked fine for two days and then an error message began to appear that states that the child lock is on and the DVD tray open/close function ceases to work. There is no way to turn the child lock off. There are numerous reports of the same problem, with no apparent fix for this. The player is therefore useless.</p>
