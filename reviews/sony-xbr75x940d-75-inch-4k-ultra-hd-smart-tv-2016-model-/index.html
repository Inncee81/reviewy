<blockquote>
<p>UPDATED 7/14/16 - ADDED PICTURE SETTING ADJUSTMENTS! Scroll to the end of the review for preferred settings.ORIGINAL REVIEW:So I had a LG EF9500 OLED 4k 65&rdquo; that I purchased from a major Brick and Mortar retailer north of Chicago which replaced my two year old Panasonic ZT60 65&rdquo; Plasma so I have quite a bit of experience with great picture quality with excellent black levels. But I wanted to go bigger but keep the excellent picture quality with exceptional Black Levels so after months of research I narrowed it down to this Sony XBR75X940D and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. I&rsquo;m still getting to know everything about the TV and fiddling with the settings and do plan on a professional ISF calibration in a few months. So far though with some really basic adjustments I am happy to report that the black levels are on par with both predecessors that this has replaced. I honestly didn&rsquo;t think it was possible for an LCD set to produce OLED blacks but this one does with the Full Array Backlight they are inky and deep with no blooming or bleeding anywhere! Wow Sony had hit a home run with this release and I&rsquo;m not missing the vignetting and poor motion handling of the OLED one bit. This Sony picture is crystal clear and crisp with excellent upscaling and motion handling. I&rsquo;m still in the early hours of owning this beast and will report back after I&rsquo;ve had time to hook up my Samsung 4k Blu Ray Player and check out some HDR discs in native 4k but so far I&rsquo;m extremely pleased with my decision to go with this Sony!NOTE: The Amazon description is wrong with regards to the statement that this model has the &ldquo;Slim Backlight Drive&rdquo; which it doesn&rsquo;t nor does it need it with the Full Array Backlight that comes only on this X940D model and is far superior to the Slim Backlight Drive that the X930D models have.UPDATE 7/14/16:After a few months of owning this fantastic TV I&rsquo;ve come up with my preferred picture settings which I&rsquo;ve listed below. I have not gotten into the any &ldquo;White Point&rdquo; adjustments but so far I&rsquo;m very pleased with the following. FYI - These are exceptional settings for Dark Room usage. For Bright Room you may need to kick up the Brightness a bit based on your viewing conditions.Picture Mode: Cinema proBacklight: 20Contrast: MaxGamma: 0Black Level: 48Black Adjust: HighAdvance Contrast Enhance: HighAuto Local Dimming: HighX-tended Dynamic Range: HighColor: 50Hue: 0Color Temperature: Expert 1Color Space: AutoLive Color: HighMotionflow: True CinemaCinemotion: HighSharpness: 50Reality Creation: ManualResolution: MaxWhen viewing HDR content via 4k Ultra HD Blu Ray the only adjustment I make is turning Brightness down to 2. This will ensure that there will be no or at least very minimal amounts of blooming or halos due to the extreme brightness of the HDR content. I also turn Reality Creation to Manual and up to 100. Your results may vary with regard to the Reality Creation so try adjusting between 30 and 100 for your particular viewing preference. Also, depending on the light in your viewing area you may be able to turn brightness up a couple notches. I wait for the Samsung Screensaver to come on my Samsung UHD Blu Ray player to make the brightness adjustment for HDR to be able to determine the best brightness setting without introducing any blooming. The HDR video setting seems to be the only one that introduces any type of blooming around bright objects on the screen.If you find any alterations to my preferred settings I would like to hear your findings and would greatly appreciate your feedback.UPDATE 11/14/2016 - This TV is still fantastic and literally getting better with time. UHD Blu Ray provides an absolutely beautiful picture and the included Dolby Atmos or DTS:X Surround Sound on most UHD Blu Rays and some regular Full HD Discs completes what is now a true Home Theater experience. But the star of the show is the Sony X940D which I am completely satisfied with no matter what content I throw at it every time I turn it on. A truly wonderful piece of technology that deserves a title of the best TV made so far for consumer use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pro:1) Great Black uniformed Levels2) screen material is glossy and very pitch black in comparison to the 850D (grayish black)3) Reflection are minmuim vs 850D gives a rainbow effect4) colors superb natural tones5) HDR 4K is mind blowing especially watching 4K HDR demosCons: screen uniformity when you do a light color test for example light gray or green or blue (can be found on utube) you can see some darker areas. Don&rsquo;t know if this could be to shipping/handlingHighly recommend whom ever you buy this from make absolute sure if not from local store to be shipped on a pallet with tilte and shock sensors. This is a sensitive large TV and last thing you want is shock or vibration miss handlingKnocked 1 star due to screen uniformity[&hellip;]</p>

<p>Love it - brought this cuz I was really tired of looking at a 50&rdquo; (Sony) - lol. Was really hoping that Sony&rsquo;s new OLED would be available at a 70+ inch size but alas, that is scheduled for a future release date (bummer) so I went ahead and got this one for the basement. Happy with the purchase - so far everything is great. Love my Sony TVs - only brand that I buy (this is my 6th Sony flat screen).</p>

<p>Great TV - as in REALLY great. Upscaling is fantastic and really works well making HD content look better. 4K HDR content is incredible. Blacks are very black (not OLED black but excellent). I ended up buying two as I was so pleased with it. Hard to beat features and price.</p>

<p>I have ordered but not receive yet&hellip;. however, I was able to compare this (at Best Buy) with 850D; and there is a significant&hellip;. difference in picture quality. Initially, I was hesitant to pay the extra 1000&hellip;.but after seeing the demo at the BB store, there wasn&rsquo;t any doubt about what i should order. Will update the review after I have used the TV for some time.</p>

<h5 id="best-and-worst-tv-ever">Best and Worst TV Ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Massive Blooming, clouding in backlight panel, horrible Grey uniformity. However watching 4k HDR Blurays it&rsquo;s the best picture I&rsquo;ve ever seen.Sony customer service is horrible. I submitted 10+ images to their &ldquo;engineers&rdquo; and they said that the TV is working to specifications. I asked what the specification for clouding and blooming was and I was sent some internal memo on how blooming, halos and clouding is normal. I don&rsquo;t buy that at all. In the end I am returning this TV to best buy, thank God for holiday return policy. I am going to buy a Samsung KS8000 65 inch. I&rsquo;m taking a 33% viewing area loss but Sony are jerks and don&rsquo;t deserve my hard earned money. I swear you should have heard these people, absolutely reading a script over and over to me. Never got a resolution and told they cannot do anything further because the engineers said it&rsquo;s normal. Look at the pictures! How is that normal? Called best buy, want to exchange for the Samsung, no problem. Thanks best buy for being nice.Â <strong><em>Update - 1/30/17 - actually replaced the TV with the same model. Exact same issues only now it&rsquo;s blooming the center. Someone said the screen may be bent and sure enough when you look down the length of it there&rsquo;s a peak in the center! Returned for an LG B6p oled. Attached a few updated photos of the new TV. So disappointing!</em></strong>Update - 2/11/17 - Got the LG65C6P wow. Unbelievable picture. 3D is fantastic. Blacks are absolute. No clouding, blooming, halos, artifacts or banding. There&rsquo;s a scene in Life of Pi that I&rsquo;ve compared to the last TV. On the Sony the blacks were blue Grey at best. The LG is black. Deep black.</p>

<p>Great TV, clear picture, no bleeding. however, the back-firing and small speakers really require a sound bar. (How convenient, Sony sells those, too.) The 16:9 format takes a bit of getting used to as not many stations broadcast that format. So the TV does not display the entirel picture when in full screen mode. Otherwise, this is a really solid TV.</p>
