<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<ul>
<li>Small Universal TV stand for many applications. Affordable, adjustable TV stand for most makes and models, easily works as a Samsung TV stand, Vizio TV stand, Panasonic TV stand, Sony TV stand, and many more. This TV swiveling TV stand creates a modern look for your audio video equipment. The black 8mm thick tempered safety glass base enhances the look and overall design.</li>
<li>Adjustable! Swivels left or right so achieving the ideal viewing angle has never been easier. Also height adjustable so your TV can be adjusted to your application or allow room for a soundbar or component below. This way the IR sensor on your TV will never be blocked and your remote control will always function as it should.</li>
<li>Replace your TV stand. This TV stand adds a unique ability to swivel where others cannot. Now your TV can be directed up to 45 degrees in each direction towards the viewing area by pivoting the unit. No need to twist the base with it. This feature is usually available only on articulating TV mounts.</li>
<li>This TV stand measures 18.75 inches tall from bottom to top of column, not including TV height. The base is 17.75” wide and 12” deep. Max TV weight is 80 pounds. This unit weighs in at just 15 pounds.</li>

<li><p>Will it fit? This TV Stand will fit most TVs from 23 to 50 inches in size and weighing up to 60 pounds. To make sure this mount will fit insure your TV&rsquo;s VESA bolt pattern falls between these two sizes : 100x100mm up to 400x400mm.</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>SLEEK, MODERN DESIGN
This replacement TV stand is great for smaller displays. The Aeon 60112 swiveling Universal TV stand is ideal for flat panel displays 23-50&rdquo;. Works great as a replacement TV stand for Samsung TV stand, Vizio TV stand, Sony TV stand and many others. All while making the most of functionality. The black 8mm thick tempered safety glass base enhances the look and overall design.</p>

<p>INTELLIGENT TV STAND
This swiveling TV mount adds a unique ability to swivel where others cannot. Now your TV can be directed up to 45 degrees in each direction towards the viewing area by pivoting the unit. No need to twist the base with it. This feature is usually available only on articulating TV mounts.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONAL TV STAND
This TV stand mounts the TV high enough to have a Sound Bar or video game sensor in front and not block the view or the infrared sensor on the TV. Most TV stands have the TV too low to do this.</p>

<p>VERSATILE FEATURES
- Fits TV&rsquo;s 23-46&rdquo; in size, even fits some smaller and large TV&rsquo;s but depends on VESA. Double check your VESA pattern to insure fit.
- Fits TV&rsquo;s with a VESA pattern between 100x100mm up to 400x400mm.
- Measures 20 inches high (not including TV) with the base measurement of 17.75&rdquo;(w) x 12&rdquo; (d).
- This stand can hold a maximum of an 60 pound TV.
- Swivels left and right up to 45 degrees in either direction.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-value-but-check-your-set-first">Good Value, but check your set first</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very solid and surprisingly heavy. It looks great, but may be a challenge for some to assemble. It is not hard, but steps need to be followed.It was used on my mothers 39&rdquo; TV. The bolt kit comes with T8 and T6 screws for the VESA mount. Her TV uses T4 screws. A trip to the local store solved the issue. Be aware of the mounting bolt size on the back of your TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-assembly-is-fairly-easy">Good quality. Assembly Is fairly easy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems like good quality. Many posted here how difficult it was to assemble. Seemed pretty straight forward to me and had my TV mounted in half hour or so. Nice swivel feature. Fit my 40 inch perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-drawings-were-good-but-sometimes-a-little-hard-to-perceive-orientation">The drawings were good, but sometimes a little hard to perceive orientation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first opened the box and looked at the assembly directions, it seemed a bit overwhelming. However, all the parts and tools were segregated into separate plastic envelopes, and were well-labeled. The drawings were good, but sometimes a little hard to perceive orientation. Assembling it took about an hour for me because I&rsquo;m methodical. (The second step of assembly was problematic because the screws wouldn&rsquo;t go in all the way until I got out some pliers). When it was completed and I attached a 46&rdquo; Samsung LED TV, it seemed stable and secure, but as a couple others have mentioned, the tv tilted downwards slightly instead of being perpendicular, because the vertical support shaft tilts forward little. (Instructions warned against over-tightening it.) All-in-all, I think this stand is a great value for the price compared to many others I researched, especially because it also swivels.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sleek-sturdy-functional">Sleek, Sturdy &amp; Functional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The TV stand shipped as promised and functions exactly as described. Assembly wasn&rsquo;t a snap but between the included instructions and the You Tube video we figured it out and got it assembled in a reasonable amount of time. It seems very sturdy and the sleek, streamlined look is exactly what I was going for with my room design. I recommend this product as a secure, understated, yet extremely functional mounting solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-and-very-sturdy">High-quality and very sturdy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>From the variety of stands I found on Amazon, I chose this one mainly because it swivels and from positive feedback from others.The stand itself is easy to assemble, as long as you keep track of the hardware it comes with and follow the instructions. The variety of screws and other hardware that is provided almost guarantees that any make and model TV will attach to the stand without a problem. The quality of the parts is very high, and the ability to change the height of the TV on the stand itself is a nice feature also. The best part is that the stand itself is very sturdy when assembled, and I have no concern with the TV or the stand tipping over, which was the main reason why I wanted a stand initially.Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-worth-the-price">Well worth the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>43&rdquo; TV - The stand is reasonably stable. It was not difficult to put together, though a couple of items were referenced with a letter and the letter was not on the packaging (the rubber feet for example). It does have a tendency to swing a couple of degrees toward center from either side, but that may be a function of the slope in my floor or the stand/table it is on. Overall, well worth the price, looks good, does the job. Sure beats my old lazy-susan and a couple of 2x4s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-those-not-comfortable-with-instructions-this-may-be-a-little-bit-of">For those not comfortable with instructions this may be a little bit of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For those not comfortable with instructions this may be a little bit of a headache to put together but you do not have to be a rocket scientist to do so. It takes a little bit of planning and organization but every part comes clearly marked. Once you organize those according to the picture it is moderately easy to assemble - took me 15 minutes - and fits beautifully in the space I bought it for. Ignore the clip on the side for wire organization, it is useless as most people have two or three cables connected to various devices and this clip does nothing. I used black zip ties and it is better. Other than that it is a great looking, slick piece of equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-indeed-seems-good">All Indeed Seems Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is very simple and self-explanatory (a third of the parts are extra screws.) but because while in progress complicationscan occur you need to take an important safety precaution. It is okay to start in the vertical position assembling the tower,as in the video, and even continue in the vertical position, but get those top nuts on as soon as possible (remembering to include top metal plate) and take care of any adjustments after that, because the rods can fall out and everything falls apart.Horizontal would probably be better but not impossible to fall apart. That&rsquo;s what caused me to start over three times and, with rest periods,take four hours to assemble. I started with TV attachments and that was really easy, not over torqued. Swivel frame bolt and nut, upper and lower, should be tightened to holding washers touching plates, (though it will require some force with your own pliers or wrench to complete, at first, it will get easier.), distributing weight into plates , not leaning against bolts.Everything is solid and not as heavy as I thought. I love that wide glass base and with rubber feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-item">Love this item!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have had this stand for some time now, and still love it! It was a little tricky to put together, but it&rsquo;s heavy, so won&rsquo;t tip over, and its versatility, with height, and the&hellip;</p>
