<p>Style:Single mountB kit
Light stands : Versatile, Hardworking &amp; Lightweight; Black anodized aluminum; Stable &amp; Quick Setup; Maximum Height: 1900 MM, 78 inches; Minimum Height: 810 MM, 32.4 inches; Maximum Load Capacity 2.5KG, 9.9 lbs; Closed Length: 805 MM, 32.2 inches; Footprint Diameter 925 MM, 37.8 inches; Mounting Stud <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches.</p>

<p>White Soft Umbrella: This translucent umbrella is a great addition to your studio setup. This umbrella works well to diffuse the light from any flash creating a soft even light for your subject. The lack of a black backing give this umbrella the ability to flash through the umbrella if needed and simulate the effects of a soft-box. Portability is a plus for location shots. This size is good for head shots and small to medium sized products.</p>

<h5 id="gets-the-job-done">Gets the job done</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this kit about a week or two ago and the shipping said it wouldn&rsquo;t arrive till February 18th. I was a little bummed about how long I&rsquo;d have to wait, but it ended up coming on February 4th!Let me describe my level of photographic experience as to put this in context: I&rsquo;m an &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; photographer, I&rsquo;ve been shooting for a year and in that year I have poured over hundreds of photography books and thousands of articles. Over this past summer I devoted myself entirely to photography. I have a D300, SB900, 50mm f/1.8, 18-70 f/3.5-5.6, and 55-200.And now for the review!I have been experimenting with off-camera flash for a while and I&rsquo;ve read a lot about softbox vs umbrella vs diffusion panels/etc and they each definitely have their own niche. If you are like me and are just getting into the &ldquo;strobist&rdquo; frenzy, this kit is PERFECT for you. A stand will run you ~$50, an umbrella mount ~$20, and the umbrella itself is typically ~$20-40. That&rsquo;s about $100.For <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the price you get <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> the results.The umbrella is pretty small as far as umbrellas typically go, but I can&rsquo;t really complain; the light is still very very soft. The umbrella mount feels cheap, but anyone who has any respect for their equipment shouldn&rsquo;t have any difficulty making it last. The stand is pretty light and extends up higher than I&rsquo;ll ever need.Unless there is absolutely NO wind whatsoever, I would not recommend this kit for outdoor use (unless you have an assistant bracing the stand for you). Everything is so light that even a strong breeze would probably tip it over. That being said, you can sprint by this thing indoors without having to worry about it falling over.FINAL VERDICT:If you aren&rsquo;t sure if strobist photography is for you, or you simply want a cheap &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; umbrella kit, buy this. If you have a real job and can drop over $100 for a manfrotto stand and a wescott umbrella then do that.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;UPDATE: So it&rsquo;s been six months since I first bought this stand and I thought it&rsquo;d be good to post a follow-up.While working outside taking photos for a friend, I was using a cinderblock that had been cut such that it would perfectly brace the stand&ndash; despite the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t particularly windy outside. When I moved the stand I forgot to move the brace with it. Sure enough, after a minute or two the stand fell umbrella-first into the dirt/hard pack snow mix. My SB900 stayed attached to the mount and stayed dry, the stand was undamaged, and the mount was in perfect condition. The only damage to any of the gear was that one spoke of the umbrella was bent slightly out of position. The umbrella still works perfectly and to be honest I forget that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;broken&rdquo; most of the time.I was so pleased with these stands that when I bought another strobe I picked up another one of these stands. It came today, and I am equally impressed by its quality.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-really-a-bargain">It&rsquo;s really a bargain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this kit to mount a Yongnuo YN-568EX speedlight to it. I have to say, it&rsquo;s pretty much exactly what I&rsquo;d expected. The umbrella is extremely basic/barebones and is probably not very durable, but when handled carefully it gets the job done. The shoe swivel bracket works absolutely fine, though I wouldn&rsquo;t trust it with any particularly heavy equipment/light modifiers. The stand is very lightweight, which is convenient in terms of transporting it&hellip; but the cost is that it would be profoundly unstable (without some sort of weight at the base, like sandbags) in any outdoor setting with a breeze. Especially if you had the umbrella attached, it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to blow it over.If I sound &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about the components of this kit, it&rsquo;s because I am. They&rsquo;re okay &ndash; not high quality, but not on the verge of falling apart either. I&rsquo;m still giving this five stars, because <em>for the price</em> they are a steal. I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re perfect for the beginner who is interested in experimenting with studio lighting. If you&rsquo;re planning to do a lot of heavy, on-location shoots&hellip; then you&rsquo;re a fool for thinking you&rsquo;re going to get high-quality, ultra-durable equipment for $30.Have reasonable expectations for equipment at this price, and you cannot be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="single-mount-b-kit-cheap-but-effective">Single Mount B Kit Cheap but Effective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the &ldquo;Single Mount B Kit&rdquo; version of this, as it was the cheapest available at the time.Over all it is a very usefull little kit.The stand is light (wouldn&rsquo;t recomend using it out in the wind without sandbags or weights), but otherwise surprisingly sturdy considering the price.The mount for this model is completely plastic the locking screws are metal threaded but with plastic handles; they are a bit stuff as well which causes issues whit the umbrella lock, you cant really know if you are over tightening it or not. The hole that holds the umbrella shaft is a decent bit too big so the umbrella sags; its not a huge issue, but one to keep in mind as it makes aiming the flash directly at the center of the umbrella even more difficult (To be clear I have never had any issues because of this). The plastic is a bit annoying but after a week of somewhat heavy use I haven&rsquo;t had the slightest issue with it so I can&rsquo;t really complain.The umbrella is definitely the cheapest of the whole thing. It has a hollow shaft which can be easily dented (mine already has a couple due to the screw issue previously mentioned) but as long as you are careful it shouldn&rsquo;t really matter. The spokes and ribs are C shaped metal rods so should they get broken (very possible) you may be able to fix them with a small wooden dowel (or any small rod) and some tape quite effectivly. The character of the light it emmits is nice and even the color seems to be just fine though with the flash not being centered causes there to be a hard edge to where the umbrella stops. I may try using a wedge to prop up the umbrella slightly to get the light more centered, but its pretty much fine. Its cheap but of you take care of it, it should last a while.All in all I am very happy with this kit it&rsquo;s cheap, but if you were willing or able to pay more then you probably wouldnt be considering this.</p>

<p>Cheap made but also cheap prices. Works good for single speedlites and not to bad for my Godox ad360 as long as I don&rsquo;t go to far up!</p>

<p>Would be fine for an indoor shoot but the quality is VERY CHEAP. It&rsquo;ll do the job but be very careful mounting any expensive equipment to it.</p>

<p>The stands arrived today, a day ahead of schedule. I couldn&rsquo;t wait and so postponed other projects so that I could set them up. Set up wasn&rsquo;t difficulty.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-beat-this-price">Can&rsquo;t beat this price</h5>

<p>Not the sturdiest but works well. Would be better with a black/silver umbrella since flash diffusers are common. Careful opening the tilt screw.</p>
