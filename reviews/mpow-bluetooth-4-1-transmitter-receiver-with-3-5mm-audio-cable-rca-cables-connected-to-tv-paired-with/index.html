<h5 id="iphone-7-and-7-plus-users">iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just opened the package and paired with my iPhone 7 plus. The perfect answer to the missing headphone jack dilemma. Smaller than I realized it would be, which is good. It is easily pocketed. What is not easily recognized in the picture on the Amazon site is that the unit has a 3.5 mm jack (female) on the side, NOT a male jack extending out the side. The Mpow in the picture has the (included) double male adapter inserted. The kit includes: double male 3.5 mm adapter, double male 3.5mm cord, male 3.5 mm to male RCA plugs cord and USB charging cable. No 110 v USB charging brick is included, which is not an issue for most folks, I&rsquo;m sure. Audio quality seems fine. No criticism here.***<strong><em>ProCamera App users: I had an inkling that this might work, and it does!!! If you pair your Mpow as a receiver, a long push on the &lsquo;+&rsquo; button will trigger the shutter on your iPhone ProCamera. So, as an added plus, you now have a remote shutter release for your iPhone 7! That is, if you have the ProCamera App from the app store, which I highly recommend as it basically turns the iPhone 7 plus into a professional camera (RAW images, better HDR, low light options, manual control of focus, shutter and aperture, on screen histograms) I&rsquo;m thinking this will come in very handy. Plus, the Mpow is small enough to easily palm if putting yourself in a photo.</em></strong>*****</p>

<p>Pairs instantly. Long battery life. For use with Bose QuietComfort15 headphones. Paired it with adapter made for these headphones. I let it hang and just clip it to my shirt. No loss of volume. Ride John Deere and I have same volume as cable.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-works-great">Perfect - Works Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A little pricey for a Bluetooth adapter at (34.99 what I paid), but it is a very high quality piece for several reasons:- Latest Bluetooth technology (exceptional sound quality and range)- Multiple connection options (the device includes multiple cables to use)- Rechargeable, never have to worry about carrying around a spare batteryOverall, this thing works great. No issues at all with connecting or dropping out which I have had with other devices.</p>

<h5 id="clear-sound-easy-setup-would-buy-again">Clear sound, easy setup. Would buy again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t replace the stereo in my van without voiding part of my warranty because it is hooked into the electrical. I&rsquo;ve been using an aux cord to listen to music from my iPhone through my radio, but if I was charging my phone at the same time it would have a whistling crackling sound in the background. It was really annoying. With this Bluetooth accessory the problem is solved. I can listen to music and charge my phone with no interference. It has the added bonus that my phone can be anywhere in the car without being plugged in and I can listen to the music and change the songs, so my kids can use my phone for PokémonGo in the backseat. The sound quality is extremely clear and this was easy to set up. I would buy this again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such an awesome very compact little device. My son has already said that he is taking it. He wants it for when he is wood working in his wood shop. It is fantastic that it is a receiver and a transmitter in 1 small device. It pairs up really easily and it is even easier when you come back to reconnect. You get about 12 hours of usage from 1 charge. We have a very open house and I was getting a clear sound clear across a couple of rooms. It will pair up to 2 devices at once. It will give you hands free calling making your hands free for driving or whatever else you may be doing. For the price point you really get your moneys worth out of this transmitter (tx) and receiver (rx) . 1 small button takes it from rx to tx mode. It is bluetooth 4.1. You can use this with your tablet&hellip; mp3 player&hellip; laptop&hellip; stereo&hellip; headphones&hellip; speaker&hellip; television, etc. This is a very versatile little device.This Bluetooth 4.1 transmitter and receiver comes with&hellip;&hellip;bluetooth receiver and transmitter&hellip;charging cable&hellip;3.5 audio cable&hellip;3.5 audio adapter&hellip;rca cable&hellip;instructions&hellip;&hellip;. very easy to read and followThis is the Mpow Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter/Receiver, 2-in-1 Wireless Audio Adapter for Headphone, Speaker, TV, PC,etcby MpowPACKAGING&hellip;&mdash;This 2 in 1 bluetooth transmitter and receiver comes nicely boxed with instructions.PROS&hellip;&mdash;very easy to pair up&mdash;very easy to reconnect&mdash;very easy to use&mdash;everything needed to use this device comes with it&mdash;easy to read and use instruction booklet&mdash;can pair to 2 devices at once&mdash;it is a receiver and a transmitter&mdash;will run a good 12 hours on 1 charge on either mode&mdash;it has a long range of connection&mdash;light weight at 3.2 ounces&mdash;very compact&mdash;comes with everything needed to use it&mdash;great price point&mdash;comes with a warrantyCONS&hellip;&mdash;none that I can find so farI was provided a Mpow Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter/Receiver for FREE and was asked only to test it and give my honest opinion.

<h5 id="bought-another">Bought another&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is actually the SECOND MPow unit I&rsquo;ve purchased. The first worked so well and is easy to use I&rsquo;ve added this one to our motorcycle so the wife can connect and control out tunes while we roll down the road&hellip;and I can keep my eyes on the road. (when Mama&rsquo;s happy&hellip;..) :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-product">Awesome product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use it to broadcast my Samsung TV to by Apple AirPods. When AirPods are not connected to Apple products, there is no way to control their volume. With this Mpow, you can adjust the transmit volume which changes the volume on the AirPods. Great range too. In Receive mode, I mount it in my hang gliding helmet via some Velcro and use my wired EarPods to listen to music and make phone calls from my iPhone connected via Bluetooth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-now-my-wife-does-not-have-to-listen">Awesome. Now my wife does not have to listen &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome. Now my wife does not have to listen to my TV at night. Just plug into the output of the TV or other electronic devise and pair with your Bluetooth headphones, and voila. Great results.</p>

<h5 id="great-but-time-will-tell">Great but time will tell&hellip;</h5>

<p>2 issues&hellip;1) when I put the volume up it changes my song when I&rsquo;m playing my pandora. So volume up on the mpow before music starts to play, and you will be all set.</p>
