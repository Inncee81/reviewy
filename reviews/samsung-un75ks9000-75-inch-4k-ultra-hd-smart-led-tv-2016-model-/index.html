<blockquote>
<p>When I started TV shopping I did a lot of research and at first bought the 55” KS8000. I liked that but when the KS9000 went on sale I exchanged it for that. One of the main reasons I went with the 9000 was the design (mainly the stand). On the 55” version of the 8000 the legs are about 44” apart. My stand that I have been using for years for several TV&rsquo;s is only 42” wide. So I had to use a large piece of wood on top of my stand just to be able to set up the 8000. This didnt really look all that great, and I didnt want to have to replace my stand with a wider one. And thankfully the 9000 has a more standard V shaped stand that fits and works great on my TV stand.And the 9000 also has some improved specs and also looks better in my opinion. I didnt really like the glossy back of the 8000. Anyway I really love this TV. Ive had several Samsungs, and my last set was the JU7100. But decided it was time to upgrade. I dont really miss the lack of 3D because I think I literally only used it once on my 7100 to test it. And I do believe 3D is on its way to being extinct. Anyway the new thing now of course is HDR. And the KS9000 really takes advantage of that. It simply looks amazing. There are several Netflix shows that show what HDR is all about. And I also recently bought the new XBOX ONE S. Ive yet to buy an HDR Bluray, but I will soon. But as I mentioned there is plenty of HDR on Netflix and Amazon Video in the meantime.One of the really cool new features this years Samsung TV&rsquo;s has its the new Tizen system. It is much more simple and streamlined this year. My favorite feature so far is how well the TV detects whatever device you are connecting and names it accordingly. I have a PS3, PS4, XBOX ONE, 360, and a PC laptop all connected to my TV. And it names them all without me having to do anything. The PS3 and PS4 are both automatically labeled as “Playstation”. And the XBOX One and 360 are both labeled by their full names each. I didnt have to type out names like I have before when customizing my input names. As you can tell I have a lot of things connected to my TV. And since it has 4 HDMI ports I use 2 HDMI 3 way splitters. They automatically switch to whatever source is powered on. So my system is set up like this:HDMI 1 = Direct TVHDMI 2 = PS3 and PS4HDMI 3 = XBOX ONE SHDMI 4 = PC, Wii U, and XBOX 360The reason I am listing these all out is because I want to add how smart this TV is. It switches the settings, input name, and device type on HDMI 4 on its own depending on whichever one is powered on. And I have different settings for PC and the Wii U and 360. I use to have to manually switch the input type every time I went from one to the other. But when I power off a device it automatically switches all the settings and input types on its own.Of course a review of a TV without talking about picture quality isnt complete so here we go. Simply put its amazing. The colors and picture are awesome. It also has very good motion handling, especially if you set Auto Motion plus to Auto. But this gives you the dreaded SOE (Soap Opera Effect). Which I really dont care for. So I use a custom setting for Auto Motion (Blur 3, Judder 3, and LED Clear Off). This gives it very good motion handling with very little SOE.As you read above I am a gamer. And one of the main things I look for when TV shopping is the input lag (or lack thereof). And this is one of the best TV&rsquo;s released this year for low input lag. In Game mode the lag is only 20.5 ms. This is great, I dont notice any lag at all. I was also thinking of getting the Sony X930D but decided not to for a few reasons, one of those is that it has about 54ms of lag. This isnt terrible, but would be noticeable in my opinion.The other main reason I went with the Samsung over the Sony is that I am still not sold on the Android Smart platform. I tested it on a 2015 Sony and it was just too buggy. I have read it is better this year, but in my opinion the new Tizen is much better.Another thing I look for in TV&rsquo;s is a good USB media player for videos on hard drives. And Im happy to say that the Samsung recognizes and plays every single file type I have tested. It also has SRT subtitle support.So overall I am very happy with this TV. It is by far the nicest set I have ever owned and I look forward to years of use with it. If you are looking for a new HDR 4K TV this should be on the top of your list. If you want a cheaper alternative go with the KS8000. Just be aware on the 55” version of the 44” wide legs. On the larger versions the 8000 has optional closer leg mounts, but for some reason Samsung did not do this on the 55” version. Anyway thanks for reading. If you have any questions or comments feel free. Ill try to answer and respond.The one issue as mentioned in the title is that the source list and its icons go blank every couple days, sometimes more. This is a known issue and apparently Samsung is looking into it. As a work around you can hold down the power button on the remote to force it to reboot. This brings the source list back, but its still an issue. Its only the upper source list, the lower one doesnt go away. If you own the set you&rsquo;ll know what I mean by the upper one. Thankfully this is an issue that can be fixed via firmware update, but as of 1131 (9-23-16) it still happens. If it gets fixed Ill try to update my review.Update: As of firmware update 1142 this missing sources issue is fixed. Im now on firmware version 1150 and the issue has not happened again. So apparently it got fixed.</p>

<h5 id="picture-issues-from-the-start">Picture issues from the start.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this TV today &ndash; the folks sent by Amazon plugged it in and said it worked fine &ndash; it does not. There is a bright light shining up from just left of center. There must be very poor quality control at Samsung. I assume this device won&rsquo;t explode like their phone but it does appear that there is a light burning out within the picture.You can see in the second photo where the screen is supposed to be black but there is a bright light shining through. You can see the washout in the other two pictures.Make sure you get a good look at the picture before accepting these TVs. Very poor quality control on such an expensive device &ndash; not too good for Samsung&rsquo;s top of the line product.I will report back on how Amazon handles these issues.I just wanted to add that the remote doesn&rsquo;t work either&hellip;</p>

<p>This review is for the 65 inch 4K ultra HD 2016 flat screen model.WHAT’S INCLUDED:Included with the TV is a metal stand, power cable, cable management accessories, wall mount adaptors, batteries, screen cleaning cloth, instruction manual, remote control, the one connect box and cable.The included manual is terrible as it is brief with very little information. Luckily, a better online manual is available on Samsung’s website and the TV also has an e-manual, although it is a bit difficult to reference at the same time when trying to setup the TV or solve an issue. Both e-manuals still lacks some details such as using voice commands though.The included stand is sturdy but unfortunately doesn’t swivel at all.I have been looking for a new 4K TV for a while and watching the prices of TV’s around the time of the Super bowl, since this is one of the best times to get a deal. When this TV’s price dropped to 1999, I grabbed it from an authorized Samsung 3PS. My previous TV, which I still use in another room, is a Sharp HD TV that is about 6 years old, so going to a new 4K made quite a difference in picture quality. I will say that in some respects I like my older Sharp TV in comparison to this Samsung, which I will outline below.DESIGN:Style wise this is a really nice looking TV with its sleek design and near bezel-less frame. The TV looks good in the room with a nice quality chrome stand.SETUP:The initial setup is simple enough as the TV automatically pairs to its unique looking remote control and walks you through the initial connections and setup. It has one of the easiest setups I have seen in a TV (minus the initial network and firmware update issues I describe below.)ONE CONNECT HUB and TV FEATURES:This TV has a small box called the one connect hub where it contains most of the slots where you connect most of your devices cables to, instead on being on the TV itself. That box is then connected via a proprietary Samsung cable to the TV. For me initially, I am not so sure that I like the one connect hub that has the majority of the TV connections (including the 4 HDMI ports). On the one hand, it makes it easy to place and/or hide all your connections but on the other hand, I found it very easy to affect the HDMI connection by just slightly moving the box.One of the main features of the one connect box is that it automatically recognizes the devices plugged into the HDMI ports. This works for the most part. It found my cable box and Sony Blu Ray player with no issues. It does not recognize my Sony receiver (plugged into the ARC port) for some reason though. I am not sure if this is because my receiver is about 9 years old with an older HDMI version or not. The receiver works well when playing audio for the Blu ray player but I have yet to get the TV audio to play through the HDMI port of the receiver. The TV does not recognize the receiver through the HDMI in the audio setup of the TV and does not have an option to switch audio to the receiver’s HDMI. So far, the only option that I can determine that I have for using my receiver’s speakers for general TV viewing is to use a separate optical cable. Is it a quirk of my older receiver or of the TV’s firmware, I am not sure? I would think that if the receiver can play audio when using my Blu ray player, that I should be able to do the same with the TV. Sometimes the TV doesn’t always disable its speaker when I am watching my Blu ray player with my Sony receiver, resulting in an echo. I have to turn the volume of the TV down completely to stop the echoing. I would mute it instead but the TV has a flashing mute button feature on the screen when the TV is on mute, which is a bit annoying. I would have preferred this to say mute and then disappear off screen.One slight annoyance with the automatic detection is that the TV automatically switches to a new device that is plugged in or turns on the last device used when you turn on the TV, even if that is the device you don’t want to use. I do find that slight annoying at times when I turn on the TV and it turns on the Blu Ray player as well, even though I plan to watch cable instead or I am connecting a new device and it switches what is on the screen without prompting me first.One additional thing to note about the 4 HDMI ports on the one connect box is that only two are true HDMI ports. One is a DVI to HDMI port and the other is an ARC (audio) port. For this price, I think there should be more true HDMI ports in the box than just the two. So, if you have more than a couple devices (technically 3 if you use the HDMI/DVI port), you may have to use a HDMI splitter.Keep in mind as well that this TV does not have any composite plugs at all, so older DVD players or legacy devices that use composite (RCA) plugs will not be usable with this TV. Granted since this is an 4K TV, this may not be a big deal since to get the best picture quality out of this TV, it makes sense that you use devices that use HDMI and/or are 4K capable but it would have been nice to have the option.The one other issue I have in the physical design of the TV is that its power cable (which I think is magnetically connected) is too easy to fall out of the back of the TV. I would much prefer a different, more secure connection. Move the TV and the plug tends to fall out.SETUP ISSUES:Although the initial setup is pretty easy, it wasn’t without its complications. One of my initial frustrations with the operating system setup was the problems I had initially connecting the TV to my network and then the subsequent issues with upgrading the TV’s firmware.Although the Samsung website did not indicate that there was a firmware update, the TV itself was indicating that there was a firmware update (version 1165, as of the time of this review) and asking you to update. Normally downloading directly is the best way to go but it took me several tries and nearly all day to finally get the update downloaded and installed. The firmware download would either stall or just stop and exit back to the setup screen.I contacted Samsung CS who was of no help as they were not aware of an update and couldn’t send me the update by email. I was hoping that I could just get the firmware either direct by email or from the Samsung website and install it via the USB. It appears that Samsung is not keeping their website up to date with the latest firmware and CS reps are not aware of them either. There is also no firmware version history either to see what is being fixed, updated or added on the Samsung page either. I later discovered that if I stopped the firmware download when it stalled and then quickly attempted to download the firmware again that it would keep the previous download percentage and continue downloading further. Even with this method, it did take several tries to get the full 100 percent firmware downloaded and installed though. I assume that the stock firmware that came with the TV was the main problem with my network and firmware updating issues. The current firmware seems to be more stable in that respect, although I do still on occasion have network connection issues with the TV.The tech support for Samsung is really hit and miss. I called not only for the firmware issues but also had a couple other technical questions and got mostly scripted answers with no real answer to my questions.REMOTE CONTROL:The remote control is also another part of the TV that I both like and dislike. It works as a universal remote and it is pretty easy to get it to sync up to different devices. Just point at the devices that are connected to the TV and it recognizes the remote frequency. Like my HDMI issues with my receiver though, the remote does not work for my Sony receiver either.The remote is designed well for navigating around the smart hub menu with its wheel control feature. The wheel button controls make it easy to scroll to where you want to go in the menu and make selections.On the other hand, though, the remote is small and has limited features. It lacks a number pad other than a virtual linear one on the TV screen which makes changing the cable box channels a bit of a pain. I find it easier to use the standard cable box remote for watching cable TV than to use the included TV remote. I also wish that the remote had some additional function buttons (in addition to a number pad) such as DVD player controls and recording controls. To me, the additional buttons would make it far more user friendly to use the remote for those features.One downside to using the cable box remote as opposed to the TV remote is the volume control isn’t as efficient to increase or decrease as you have to continually hit the button to raise or lower volume one level versus the Samsung remote where you just hold the volume up or down to increase or decrease several spots. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that I tend to prefer for a lot of applications, although this TV remote does have some promise if they just modified the design a bit by adding more buttons or a touch screen like the Logitech remotes.The remote control also does not have buttons that can be easily seen in the dark or any type of backlighting, making it a bit difficult to use in low light conditions.The remote has a unique microphone feature for voice commands that you press and hold and talk into but I found that the voice recognition is a bit spotty at times and doesn’t reliably work as well as my smart phone. I really wish electronics makers would use smart phone technology when it comes to building voice command features as they almost always don’t work nearly as well as Google or Siri.I do think that the remote is a bit small and feels a bit flimsy. My one complaint with this is that the remote back easily falls off the remote.TV APPS:The TV does seem to have most of the popular apps which work fairly smoothly. Navigation through the apps is fairly smooth and easy to do with the remote. I like the channel preview screen that is integrated with my cable provider, although it is a bit limited on the channels you can preview. Not all the apps are here though, but with my Blu Ray player, I have most of what I use available anyways.PICTURE QUALITY:This TV has a really nice quality picture that is very sharp, bright and colorful. The TV handles motion good with no blurring that I can tell. I don’t use for gaming but based on how it handles fast motion in movies and television, this should work fine for that. Unlike my older Sharp, this TV doesn’t have 3D capability, which seems to be on the way out for most new TV’s. To me, this isn’t a big deal as I could count on one hand, the number of times I have used the 3D feature on my Sharp. One small irritation is that the TV doesn’t seem to remember custom screen settings, such as when I expand the screen to eliminate the black bars above and below for a video I have on a hard drive. It goes back to the default setting when you turn off the TV.Pros:Nice looking TV with its near bezel-less designFantastic picture quality with great contrast, color and black levelsDecent basic TV audioGood upscaling to 4KFast refresh rateRemote control automatically connects and works well with most devices (See cons)Remote control wheel makes navigating smart hub easyInitial setup is fairly simple (see cons also)Automatically recognizes connected HDMI devices (see cons also)Good online e-manualSturdy standSmart hub OS is a nice feature that runs quickly and smoothly, easy to navigate4 HDMI ports (see cons also)One connect hub makes it easy to place and hide cable connectionsGood selection of appsTV interfaces nicely with cable providerCons:Included printed manual is terribleStand doesn’t swivelPower plug tends to fall out a bit too easyFirmware included with TV has issuesNetwork connection is spotty with initial firmwareFirmware updating is slow and a pain to do with base firmwareSamsung tech support is not goodSamsung website is not up to date with firmware releasesVoice recognition on remote is spottyLack of detailed instructions in e-manual on voice recognition featureOne connect hub is a bit flakey and sensitive with movement with HDMI connectionsAutomatic device detection feature can be annoying at timesRemote control is a bit flimsy/back comes off too easyRemote control has limited features/lacks some needed buttonsRemote control lacks backlighting making it difficult to see in low light conditionsDoesn’t always play nice with older HDMI devices (such as my older Sony receiver)Only 2 of the 4 HDMI ports are true HDMI (one is ARC for audio and the other is a DVI to HDMI port)No 3DDoesn’t seem to remember custom screen settingsNo composite (RCA) plugs for legacy devicesFlashing mute icon is annoyingDoesn’t always disable TV Speaker when playing audio through a receiverPricey unless you catch on saleEven though I have my complaints with the TV, most of which have to do with the initial network/firmware issues and some lack of compatibility with older devices, I still like this TV for its best feature which is the great quality picture. There should be a few design improvements with the remote and one connect hub but overall, this is a great looking TV4 stars</p>
