<p>Offer Type:Yagi/Panel Antennas
The Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel cell phone signal booster by SureCall increases cell signal strength for voice, text and 4G LTE data for all North American cell carriers, including AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. The Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel delivers unrivaled performance with cutting-edge technology, reducing dropped and missed calls and extending battery life for multiple simultaneous users on all cellular networks. Cellular reception weakens due to topography, building materials, structural design and distance from the cell tower. The Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel captures this outside cellular signal, boosts it and re-broadcasts that signal inside to your cellular device. The Fusion4Home booster is bi-directional meaning signals are amplified as they travel back and forth from your device to the cell tower ensuring that you stay connected. Dropped calls are history, as the Fusion4Home Yagi/Panel provides clear and consistent coverage for all cellular devices in a small home or office, up to 4,000 Sq Ft. With an industry leading 3-year warranty, SureCall proudly stands behind their products and emphasizes the importance of a great user experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I started my home booster adventure with a WeBoost Connect 4G and ended up returning it because it couldn&rsquo;t handle the fact that in my area we have Verizon and AT&amp;T both operating LTE in the 700Mhz band, where they are right next to each other in the frequency spectrum. The AT&amp;T signal comes in a bit stringer than Verizon and I need Verizon, but for the WeBoost these are indistinguishable. The result was that the WeBoost didn&rsquo;t amplify the Verizon LTE signal enough causing my phone to stick to 3G (which is in a different band).I purchased the SureCall unit because of the manual gain adjustments, which I expected would let me tune down the 3G signal so my phone would actually hop to 4G giving me decent data transfer rates. The short of the story is that (a) the per-band tunig does work and help, (b) the LED indicators are much more informative allowing me to understand what is happening much better, and &copy; this booster provides some degree of distinction between the two adjacent LTE carriers. This unit is also much better built being all-aluminum and the exterior Yagi has higher gain. I have had several email exchanges with the SureCall support and got great responses. The only downside is that I got the version with the little indoor omni instead of the panel antenna and the panel is better. But I am now buying a ceiling dome, which I hope to be better than either of the other two.In summary, if you&rsquo;re hesitating between the WeBoost Connect 4G and the SureCall Fusion4Home I would recommend the SureCall.One thing that is somewhat confusing is what the various LED flash patterns really mean. There is a yellow insert sheet that describes them, but it&rsquo;s a bit incomplete. Here are a few more notes:- If an LED is OFF it means that the booster is operating in that band at the gain set by the dial, i.e., it&rsquo;s doing great (this state is completely missing from the docs).- If an LED is flashing YELLOW it means that automatic gain control (AGC) is reducing the gain (amplification) in that band below what is set because of feedback between the indoor and outdoor antennas. If you want a stronger indoor signal you need to increase separation.- If an LED is flashing RED it means that AGC is reducing the gain in that band below what is set because the signal from the tower is too strong (I suspect the reduction is primarily on the transmit-to-tower side).In my configuration I&rsquo;m having insufficient antenna separation for maximum amplification and I&rsquo;m not that far from towers so what I observe is the following. If I turn the gain for a band all the way down the LED becomes red indicating that the band is off. As I turn up the gain the LED goes to blinking red indicating that the tower signal is strong and AGC is limiting the gain (I presume in the transmit to tower direction). As I turn the gain up further the LED switches to blinking yellow indicating that AGC is also limiting the gain transmitting indoors due to feedback between the two antennas. All this has allowed me to learn much more about what is really happening and I have been able to tune the bands so everything works OK for me. The next step will be to purchase a ceiling dome antenna for indoors because it radiates much less upwards to where the outdoor antenna is. The alternative would be to relocate or raise the outdoor antenna, which is more difficult for me.Update may 2017: the booster is still working well for me. I ended up purchasing an indoor dome antenna in order to increase the separation between the outdoor antenna on my roof and the indoor antenna. I selected a &ldquo;DomeAnt-Alpha Omnidirectional Ceiling Antenna for Boosters, Amplifiers, Repeaters&rdquo; after contacting WirEng and getting confirmation that this antenna has the least upwards radiation, i.e., interferes the least with the outside antenna above my roof. This antenna made a big difference for me.</p>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As many reviewers were, I was skeptical. I recently switched to att, and had anywhere from 1(mostly) to 2 bars 4g lte outside or near windows. I would often lose signal in interior areas. My wife&rsquo;s cspire had a weak signal. I installed the yagi antenna at roof top, and flat panel in hallway, close to middle of house. I now keep at least 1 bar of 4glte anywhere inside, more like 3 to 4 bars closer to inside panel antenna. My wife&rsquo;s phone keeps 2 bars 4glte closer to panel. My dsl is slow, this system made my cellular internet better. My thanks to the reviewers and their responses I read before purchasing!</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works GREAT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works great. I was lucky to have one bar outside. The house has a metal roof and never had any coverage inside. This gives me 3 bars of signal and crystal clear conversations. The data rate is not as fast as having good service, but twice as fast as my junk DSL. So all and all I love it.</p>

<h5 id="good-with-a-wilson-antenna">Good with a Wilson antenna</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my 5th wheel travel trailer. After trying every combination with the antenna I was very flustered and unhappy. I bought a Wilson trucker antenna and fastened it to the ladder using only the 14 ft cable I hooked it up and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Working great</p>

<h5 id="works-great-1">Works great!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a long time Weboost/Wilson user and always wanted an alternative just because I wasn&rsquo;t always happy with the performance of Weboost at times. This Surecall system works better than Weboost and I will buy Surecall from now on.</p>

<p>We moved high into the mountains in a rural community where the only internet I have is using my cell as a hotspot. My business depends on fast, dependable internet. My husband set this up in under an hour and we are now streaming Netflix, no longer have dropped calls and even have a usable internet signal downstairs where we did not before installing this. I am thrilled!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This product works exactly like it&rsquo;s supposed to!Went from inconsistent one bar of service to consistently three bars of Verizon LTE in my office.I have consistent two bars outside where I mounted my Yagi antenna about 18 feet up on a pole, but due to my office being located in a hollow at the bottom of a hill, service inside my office was very erratic.SureCall Fusion4Home fixed my problem.Setup was easy,no more dropped calls and fast data speeds! I have been using it about two months now and couldn&rsquo;t be happier!</p>
