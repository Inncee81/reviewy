<h5 id="stealthy-speed">Stealthy Speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have said, I don&rsquo;t use a hand mixer a whole lot, but when I need one, I need one. I love this mixer. I bought this mixer based on people saying it had a good low speed, and yes it does. My old mixer&rsquo;s speeds were high, super-high, and bat-out-of-hell high.To counter what others have said about the mixer&rsquo;s high speed seeming like medium, we put it to the tachometer test. Yes, the BF has a tachometer, so we hooked it up to the mixers. In the tachometer test, the old mixer&rsquo;s low speed started at 1050 rpm, with the highest speed being 1250 rpm- not a lot of range. The Kitchenaid 5 Speed&rsquo;s low speed was a nice mellow 260 rpm. Speed 2 was 450 rpm, then 650, 800, and 1100 rpm for speeds 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The thing is, even at the high speed, it&rsquo;s very quiet, and doesn&rsquo;t sound like a jet engine about to take off, so I believe it <em>sounds</em> like a lower speed, but it&rsquo;s more than enough to whip cream, egg whites, or whatever else you want that high speed for. As for power, I cannot comment; if I&rsquo;m going to mix bread dough, or some big heavy job, I get out the big heavy stand mixer. Right tool for right job and all that. It&rsquo;s certainly strong enough for some whipped potatoes- it handled creaming cold butter, no problem, so potatoes should be easy.</p>

<h5 id="this-mixer-does-a-great-job-at-a-good-price">This mixer does a great job at a good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great mixer, and I&rsquo;m not sure why someone said that the high speed wasn&rsquo;t enough to make meringues. It is. I have made several with it, and I&rsquo;ve only had this mixer for about six weeks. It also does a great job with mashed potatoes, and has mixed cookie dough as well. I really like the various speeds on it, and many thanks to the reviewer who put it to the tachometer test &ndash; that was the review that made me go ahead and order this Kitchenaid. The mixer is much quieter than other hand mixers I have had in the past, and I do think that that could make someone think the mixer didn&rsquo;t have enough power, if going by the sound. It&rsquo;s hard to tell your brain to ignore that, but you should, because this mixer has plenty of quiet power. I should also say that I am not a novice cook by any means, having raised eight kids in the past 35 years, and fed not only them, but crowds of their friends (and I do mean crowds). I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I would like the beaters, and they were actually one of my biggest hesitations in ordering this. I have always had the square, heavy duty ones, and these looked flimsy in the picture. After using this mixer a number of times, though, I have changed my mind on the blades. The wire blades seem to do a great job, and the dough, potatoes, cake batter, etc. doesn&rsquo;t cling to them as it does to the large square ones. Saves me a minute or two on scraping all the extra stuff off the blades and into the bowl at the end, and these beaters wash up much faster, without any residue clinging to the insides of the blades to gross out the next person who uses them. Hmmm &hellip; what else? Oh, the color. I bought the yellow, and I really like it. It is NOT exactly as pictured. The picture is honestly a cuter shade, and that was a small disappointment, but only a small one. I don&rsquo;t primarily buy a mixer for the color anyway (although I could if I weren&rsquo;t such a frugal person, because the colors are really cute). And the actual yellow color of the mixer that arrived reminded me of the yellow hand mixer my mother used when I was a little girl, so I can&rsquo;t complain. :)</p>

<h5 id="decent-cheap-mixer">Decent cheap mixer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mixer is ok for light use. DO NOT use it for any thick batters (I used it to make scones &amp; could smell the motor burning). I am going to buy the better model when I can afford to spend $80; for the time being, however, this $30 model is ok for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-cuisinart">Better than Cuisinart</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My old Cuisinart hand mixer shook violently when I used it, so it was a pleasant change of pace to receive this Kitchen Aid mixer. The two gripes I have are 1) the highest speed doesn&rsquo;t even come close to a &lsquo;beat&rsquo; speed, and 2) you really have to jam the beaters into the grooves to get them to stay out. Otherwise, it is an easy to use hand mixer that is pretty quiet, and 50x better than a Cuisinart hand mixer.</p>

<h5 id="i-been-living-in-the-caveman-era-for-sometime-and">I been living in the caveman era for sometime and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I been living in the caveman era for sometime and been using the manual whisk &hellip; yes the one where you have to literally use your hands to whisk all the stuff together anyway &hellip;. this thing has changed my life i can mix cookies in 10 seconds and my arm wont be sore. my girlfriend loves this thing now i never have to hear her grouting and moaning cause all the pain her arms were in <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would buy again.</p>

<h5 id="for-a-hand-held-beater-this-is-the-best-i-ve-used">For a hand held beater this is the best I&rsquo;ve used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For a hand held beater this is the best I&rsquo;ve used. It&rsquo;s got a good low speed and high speed with everything else in between. The one I have has lasted forever and I&rsquo;ve just purchased one for my daughter who is married and in her own home now and the hand mixer she received for a wedding gift just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it. This is an excellent value and the colors are fun, too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-hand-held-beaters">Good Hand Held Beaters.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Kitchen Aid beaters are great, and I admit I love the bright color of the pink! I prefer the old version of the beater blades that were &ldquo;flat&rdquo; instead of wires&hellip; but those don&rsquo;t seem to be available anymore. Though powerful, this appliance still has limits when mixing thick concoctions like cookie dough. Very nice beaters. Convenient and not too heavy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-the-color-cranberry-red">I like the color (cranberry red)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the color (cranberry red), I like how it works, but the beater fell apart at the point where the wires go into the stem of the beater. This has happened in less than 2 years with the last 4 KitchenAid hand mixers I&rsquo;ve purchased, whether they were a professional grade or standard. I&rsquo;m extremely frustrated with the poor quality on these KitchenAid beaters. The KA hand mixers we had 15-30 years ago never had a beater break down like the new ones do today.</p>

<p>It worked the first time I used it but hasn&rsquo;t worked ever since.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recieved this on Sunday after ordering on Friday. It replaced an identical machine that was dropped and met a fatal end.</p>

<h5 id="the-exact-same-batch-of-eggs-whipped-up-fine-in-my-stand-mixer">The exact same batch of eggs whipped up fine in my stand mixer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The top speed is too slow &ndash; I can&rsquo;t whip up egg whites with it. The exact same batch of eggs whipped up fine in my stand mixer, which I had to haul out to make meringue.</p>
