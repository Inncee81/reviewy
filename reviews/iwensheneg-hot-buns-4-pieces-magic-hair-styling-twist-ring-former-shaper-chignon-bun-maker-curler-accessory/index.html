<h5 id="hair-twists">Hair Twists</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The iWenSheneg Hot Bun Magic Hair Styling Twists make putting your hair in a bun very easy to do. There are two sizes of rollers so they are good for any hair type.My Granddaughter likes to try different hair styles and she has long thin hair. It was easy to roll her hair in these and keep it up in a bun on the crown of her head.The twists are made of foam with a nice covering and vel-close type of bands to make them easy to hold your hair. Once you put your hair in a ponytail, it is easy to roll hair around them and snap the ends close. There is an elastic band that loops over the bun to keep it securely in place.I rolled my own hair and it is easy to do for yourself too. I have thick hair and it easily held the bun in place.These would be good for every day use or to do your own updo for a formal event. Would work for all hair types.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-and-good-quality">Easy to use and good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I usually dont get things like this because they usually tear out my hair or break after one use but i am pleased to say these are very different, i wore it all day and it didnt tear my hair out and it was super easy to use, i also really like how informative the instructions were because they helped me put the bun in all by myself with no help.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-a-bit-awkward-for-me">This was a bit awkward for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a bit awkward for me to use.This comes with 4 pieces and for the most part is easy to use.You basically roll your hair up on it, fold over and snap it together then after adjusting the hair so nothing is showing you should use the rubber band to slip over it and hold it all in place.I get to that part, and then it just doesn&rsquo;t look as good as I would like when I let go.I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or my hair is too thin or what.I have very long hair.I can use this on my daughter and it looks pretty good. But the rubber band thing is just not working out that great.I have tried the other type that are like the slap bracelets and those work great for me.But I am going to keep trying.</p>

<h5 id="makes-a-perfect-bun">Makes a perfect bun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have very long hair and the bottom in in a v shape so it was very hard since my hair was not straight across to start it and roll. Took me awhile but after I got it rolling it seem to look pretty good. I used the smaller one but I think my harr was too long for that one because I never did find the string to pull tight. I ended up using a couple of pins just to hold in place. Maybe I will try the larger one next time. I do believe with a little practice you can easily make a perfect bun with these.iWenSheneg Hot Buns 4 Pieces Magic Hair Styling Twist Ring Former Shaper Chignon Bun Maker Curler Accessory ( 2 Large &amp; 2 Small) (Brown)</p>

<h5 id="these-forms-are-so-easy-to-use-and-they-make-a-perfect-bun">These forms are so easy to use and they make a perfect bun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These forms are so easy to use and they make a perfect bun. I have fine hair and I used the smallest one on me, it worked like a charm and I had enough hair to disguise the form. These forms work best with medium or thick hair. They grab the hair in the velcro and hold it in place the whole day. When I took it out, I removed all the hair in the velcro, sprayed it with a disinfectant spray and stored it away.</p>

<h5 id="easy-bun-maker-hair-accessory">Easy bun maker hair accessory.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these bun makers. They&rsquo;re so easy to use. I can do my hair in a couple minutes.mm it comes with 2 each of a small and larger size. I&rsquo;m keeping one of each size and giving the other 2 to my daughter. It also comes with Bobby pins and a nice heavy duty zip lock type bag for storage. Great for keeping and gifting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-cute-buns">Nice, cute buns.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried this and the bun donut style bun makers and I found this to be easier to use. My hair is kind of thin so I use the smaller one and I think it helps to try to spread your hair across this as much as possible before looping and snapping it together. The banded design helps the hair to stay in place.</p>
