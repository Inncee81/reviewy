<h5 id="my-successful-attempt-at-a-laptop-replacement">My successful attempt at a laptop replacement.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Coming from a 4yr old bogged down Toshiba laptop running Vista, this was purchased to be a laptop replacement. I plan to use it for email, internet, netflix, social, games, minor word/excel, etc. I wanted to get away from Windows, have something light and portable (this 12.2&rdquo; weighs 1.61 lbs nearly what the original iPad (1.50 lbs) &ndash;3rd and 4th gens (1.45lbs) weighed which was never considered &ldquo;heavy&rdquo;). I wanted it to have multiple user support so my wife and I can have separate profiles. I wanted to get away from the larger laptop power supply.Some of the features that allow this to be a laptop replacement:12.2&rdquo; screen that can allow 4 apps split on the screenLarge touch keyboard (likely will get Logtitech Pro Keyboard for occasional heavy word/excel usage)Hancom Office2yrs office link to my desktopThings I like:Beautiful screenSplit screenQuick, snappyEasily expands to 96gb with ~$35 64gb microSD cardPlays nicely with my existing Android ecosystem$25 Google Play creditThings I dislike:Hancom office is great, but I&rsquo;ve struggled with a few things in its version of Excel like moving a graph and their website is lacking at this time.Wish more apps were available for multi-window.Magazine UX still needs top allow more customizationOther comments:I see a lot of negative reviews saying it costs so much compared to the competition (first off I think most are comparing to the Note vs Tab).iPad Air 32gb - $599 (March 2014)Tab Pro 12.2 32gb - $649 (March 2014)You get a lot more for that $50 as well as a better operating system in my opinion.To compliment this tablet, I plan to get the Logtitech keyboard case as well as a soft mount/stand for more comfortable use of the tablet on the couch.<strong>Update 3/22/14</strong> With poor reviews on the Logtitech keyboard, I saved a bunch and am really happy with a $26 Anker ultralight and thin BT keyboard. The ipevo stand is great too. This combo is working better than expected as a laptop replacement!<strong>Update 6/20/14</strong> This tablet is still working greats as a laptop replacement. With nightly use, I&rsquo;m still getting 5-8 days on a charge! Android 4.4 is rather frustrating as it is restricts SD card access. I found this petition to bring access back. [&hellip;]<strong>Update 12/2/2014</strong> I&rsquo;m still quite happy with this. My wife and I use it daily and it does what we need. The only time I need to get the old laptop out is to do datalogs on car (requires Windows), or to do a Shutterfly Photobook which requires Flash. I&rsquo;ve heard that the tablet will be updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop in 1Q2015, which should resolve the SD card access issues. This will allow me to automate some backups from SD to network.<strong>Update 9/9/2015</strong> Still happy with this as it is now 1-1/2yrs old. Battery life with light daily use is still 4-8 days. Was hoping Lollipop update would have arrived by now. I have been using Kingsoft Office for Word/Excel style apps vs Hancom.<strong>Update 6/2/2016</strong> Still working really well after 2+yrs. Would like a Marshmallow update, but current OS is working fine. Still good battery life. Envision using it at least another year or two.</p>

<h5 id="business-productivity-brought-to-a-tablet">Business productivity brought to a tablet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the Tab Pro 12.2 with the idea of using it as a second screen at the office, as the 8-inch Tab 3 I had was a bit too small for my office needs. I quickly discovered that the Tab Pro is a little workhorse all on its own, and I&rsquo;m using it a surprising amount of the time in place of my office PC. I did find the Hancom Office app, which is pre-loaded on the Tab 12.2, to be severely lacking in function and usability. I switched over to the Kingsoft app and haven&rsquo;t looked back. That made a huge difference in the ability to productively edit more complicated (yet faithfully rendered) Powerpoint, Word and Excel documents. Both that app and the Tab in general are well-integrated with Dropbox, so it&rsquo;s easy to save what you&rsquo;re working on to the cloud. The virtual keyboard on this tablet is one of the best I&rsquo;ve seen, with well-spaced keys, but it&rsquo;s still a virtual keyboard. At the office, I added a Bluetooth keyboard which has sped up the typing considerably.I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s Samsung&rsquo;s doing or Google&rsquo;s, but the text selection controls and cut/paste functionality is much more efficient than on older Tabs. I&rsquo;ve also used a stylus with this (just a cheap one from Amazon) and it works beautifully - very little lag on the display when handwriting, and nice responsiveness when highlighting or selecting text. Multi-window makes it a snap (literally) to view two apps at the same time. Be aware, however, that there are only a limited number of mutli-window-capable apps right now. If you want to view two web pages in Multi-window simultaneously, you&rsquo;ll need to open two different browsers. Need to print out what you&rsquo;re working on? That also works very nicely (provided you have a wifi printer that you can connect to.) You&rsquo;ll need one of the apps at the Play store to do it, but it worked flawlessly for me.The charge on this is pretty decent - it lasts all day without having to plug into a charger, and that&rsquo;s with the screen on a good portion of the time. This battery has a pretty big capacity, but the downside is that the time to charge a nearly-dead battery might be longer than you expect (I believe around 6 hours at minimum). My 2 year old laptop was topping out at around 2.5 hours of run time, even with a fairly new battery, so this is a huge plus for me.What I love about this tablet is that I get everything that&rsquo;s awesome about Android combined with the productivity tools of a PC, on a tablet that i don&rsquo;t have to squint over. While my office PC is stalling while it updates windows, download the latest antivirus updates, or whatever else it wants to do during bootup, thanks to the Tab, by the time the PC is ready to go, I&rsquo;ve already checked and responded to email, critiqued documents sent by colleagues, and caught up on the latest news in my field. I agree, it&rsquo;s not the most portable Tab out there - I&rsquo;d highly recommend taking a look at the 8 inch if you need a tab to constantly carry around with you - but for what it is, it&rsquo;s a thing of beauty.ADDENDUM: Five stars for the ease of contacting Samsung&rsquo;s tech support (24 hours by chat? nice!). One star for the ability to redeem their Samsung Perks. I have spent nearly an hour on registration websites and in the chats trying to figure out how to get the magic email that entitles me to Google Play credit, Dropbox space, etc. So far no luck. My request is being &ldquo;escalated&rdquo;. Update: Well, to Samsung&rsquo;s credit, I got an email back from their &ldquo;Perks&rdquo; coordinator the next day, which contained all of the promotion codes for the various services.</p>

<h5 id="great-tablet-when-it-works">Great tablet..when it works&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had bought this Tablet for my husband,as he has sight issues, and this was a great size for him to be able to see the screen andfont better. He lives through his tablets as I&rsquo;m sure all can understand,so we were very excited to see this, and I snapped it up when I saw it! We were thrilled with the talet ..at first. Then..problems started happening. The screen would start to blin uncontrollably, and shut off for no reason. We contacted Samsung who said they wuld fix the problem. My husband is a techie, and told them at the time that there is a design flaw in the software. We sent it out to Samsung, and they &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; the problem. It worked for about 2 weeks and then started having the same issues. We sent it back AGAIN&hellip;to have it &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; again. Same problems same time span&hellip;We then asked to have it replaced, as we have a oneyear warranty on it, with a different model perhaps understanding if a price difference was involved we&rsquo;d have gladly settled it. We were told we could not have it replaced, and as they would &ldquo;fix&rdquo; it again, would not send a new one either. VERY dissappointed in Samsungs professionalism. We have bought MANY MANY android devices, and will think twoce before dealing with Samsung in the future. Extrememly disallusioned.</p>
