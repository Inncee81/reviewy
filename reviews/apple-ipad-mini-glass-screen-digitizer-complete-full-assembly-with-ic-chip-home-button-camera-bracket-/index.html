<h5 id="excellent-product-educate-yourself-first">excellent product, educate yourself first</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item on a whim to fix my son&rsquo;s iPad mini. I was aware of the underwhelming reviews. The product works perfectly. My wife and I successfully replaced the screen in about one hour. It has worked flawlessly since. Educate yourself on how to do it on youtube. I would recommend using a blow dryer rather than a heat gun. We used a heat gun thinking the adhesive probably needed a lot of energy to release. This is not the case, with just a few seconds of heat, we were able to pry the glass off. In hindsight, slower heating would be safer. We did overheat the top corner of the iPad causing some damage to the LCD. A very small section of the screen is foggy due to over heating. Although not perfect, the damage is not a problem and has nothing to due with this product.This product comes with a pre-connected cable which is very important. Some models offered are not pre connected, don&rsquo;t waste your time with those. This product also has adhesive strips already attached that work amazingly well.This is an excellent product for what it is. It is simply a part! It is a quality part. It does not come with directions or hand-holding. If you are willing to do a little research on YouTube and have above average common sense, you can do this job. The product itself, is good!</p>

<h5 id="a-difficult-repair-but-possible-well-worth-15">A difficult repair, but possible. Well worth $15</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After receiving this glass screen digitizer from amazon, I waited a few days to start the repair. I was questioning my ability to successfully complete this repair as it is known as one of the most difficult apple device repairs. Well I am here to tell you that it is difficult, but it is possible.The iPad I worked on had a pretty well shattered screen, and fortunately the frame was not bent. The screen had cracking even while inside an otterbox case.Because of some of the reviews I questioned the quality of the screen, but I figured with the low price I wouldn&rsquo;t be loosing much. As described, the screen came complete with nearly everything that was needed to made the repair as simple as possible. It has the digitizer cable and the IC chip thing, the home button and pre-applied adhesive strips that are holding well (fingers crossed). The only pieces not included are some small pieces of black tape from the original screen that need to be applied to the bottom, near the home button. Also, the small magnets that are used for the smart cover to lock and unlock the iPad needed to be transferred to the new glass frame.The most difficult part of the repair for me was removing the broken glass. Some advice for attempting the repair : a metal pry tool was a necessity for me to get between the glass and the frame, the plastic pry tools weren&rsquo;t working. Keep track of the small screws! For this repair, there are four screws to remove the lcd. Under the lcd, there is a metal shield that has 13 small screws and 2 larger screws, by my count. To access the lcd, digizter, and battery connectors, a small metal shield has three small screws to remove.Some who have attempted this repair have reported that the lcd back light no longer works, meaning the ipad turns on but the screen is completely dark. This happens likely because the iPad was accidentally turned on while the lcd was disconnected which can cause the back light fuse on the main board to blow. This is virtually repairable damage. So make sure to disconnect the battery FIRST, just in case! I did not do this, and was worried that I blew the back light fuse when the back light would not turn on. Fortunately this was fixed when I disconnected the battery, then the lcd, and then reconnected them in reverse order. So if your back light does not turn on, try doing that.The new glass is significantly more reflective than the original as seen in the pictures. However, it is not that noticeable when the screen is on. It would probably be more of a problem in sunlight. The digitizer seems to be ever so slightly less responsive in the top left corner of the display, but it hasn&rsquo;t been an issue yet. Barely noticeable. But for around $15, I can&rsquo;t complain too much. It is certainly better than having a shattered display. I will update the review if any issues arise.Two helpful resources for the repair -[&hellip;]I would recommend watching this repair video once or twice before attempting the repair. Try to have all the tools that are used in the video as well.[&hellip;]</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-product">Really Nice Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really impressed with the quality of this screen. I&rsquo;ve fixed quite a few Apple products and have used a few different vendors. I will say they did an awesome job preinstalling all of the parts (which you would otherwise have to transfer over yourself). 1) kapton and electrical tapes were perfectly installed on the IC chip preventing the frame from contacting the chip which if not done causes phantom touching among other problems which can drive a person nuts. 2) Home button bracket is solid and comes with the rubber gasket which makes for a nice click and prevents dust and water vapor from getting in. Nice job with tapes on home button cable as well. 3) Adhesive was better most I&rsquo;ve tried. Many times the adhesive is weak and you need to put some weight on it until it&rsquo;s locked down in place or it can pop up. This stayed in place right from the start. Nicely done. Now to see if it holds up!! Pics of finished repair.</p>

<h5 id="garbage">Garbage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this aftert son stepped on his iPad mini and shattered the glass. It still worked so I knew it only needed a digitzer and not an LCD. The amount of reviews and the price of this one made it look like this would be the one. I have a buddy at work that has lots of experience fixing iPhones and iPads so he broke it down and istalled this one rather quickly. The adhesive worked well, the edges held nice and tight. But when I tried to use it, my finger/stylus was only recognized about half the time. I knew it was a defect because it worked perfectly with the shattered glass. Sent it back and ordered one from a different manufacturer and my son is back in business.</p>

<h5 id="fit-is-good">fit is good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great. This not a easy project if you have never done this before. I have done many iphone screens, but this was the first Ipad screen I did, but it was easier than the Iphone screen. This item is fully loaded with all the parts needed including the home button assembly. Just remove the old glass, peel the plastic from the adhesive tape (glue) from the perimeter of the new glass, then install. The fit was perfect. The key is to make sure you remove all the old adhesive before you install the new glass. Any old adhesive will make the new glass sit incorrectly. . The heat gun helps to soften it and then rub it out with a cloth rag. I then used a combination of alcohol and acetone to remove any residue of the old adhesive. There is no instruction sheet or guide but you can youtube it and find many videos on how to install. The function and fit was very good. The only thing, a very minor thing, is that the home bottom seems to sit a tad bit higher than the original.</p>

<p>Fit my iPad mini original. The sticky glue didn&rsquo;t stay so I ran around the edges carefully with a hair dryer to activate the adhesive. So far it&rsquo;s seemed to work.</p>
