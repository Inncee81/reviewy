<h5 id="think-twice-before-purchasing">Think twice before purchasing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so disappointed in this expensive purchase and Parrot&rsquo;s support, I wish I could rank this product with negative stars.After reading the manual and setting up, the drone was launched from our half acre of grass front lawn. At first all seemed great as it took off easily and moved right into loitering above us. However several times I encountered a &ldquo;drone disconnected&rdquo; message on screen even though the drone was only a few houses down.Finally it ended in a crash as we noticed a piece of the right wing come off. First a drone disconnected message came on screen and it came down three houses away in a strange spiral. It crashed hard into many pieces. That was not in the manual.After calling Parrot support I am told that my story does not match the &ldquo;flight data&rdquo; and that they reviewed my property and the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> acre of grass front lawn is inadequate to launch and land the drone ( not that it actually landed where we were ). So for $1,300 we got about twenty minutes of drone flying.</p>

<h5 id="to-say-i-am-disappointed-is-to-understate">To say I am disappointed is to understate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Parrot claims maximum range is 2000 meters or 1.24 miles. With clear air line of sight, maximum distance in real life was 500 to 1000 feet, even with the controller pointed directly at the aircraft. On the second flight, the Disco reported &ldquo;Drone Disconnected&rdquo; or &ldquo;Max Range Exceeded&rdquo; at 1000 feet distance max in clear air line of sight. Upon receiving &ldquo;Drone Disconnected&rdquo;, and with 85% battery remaining, the Disco circled a few times and then crashed. To say I am disappointed is to understate. We awaited this delivery anxiously; perhaps the lesson here is &ldquo;never buy anything at Version 1.0.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="parrot-disco-very-capable-if-understood-and-that-s-not-easy">Parrot Disco - very capable if understood .. and that&rsquo;s not easy!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest problem w. the Parrot Disco is the lack of a good user manual that fully describes its very complicated flight control and autopilot system. I have a lot of experience w. RC aircraft and quadcopter drones of all makes and functionality, from the simplest to the most complex. Before I ever flew the Disco I spent a LOT of time reading the inadequate Parrot manual, looking at YouTube videos, and talking to customer support. My first flight was in a huge open pasture, and went just fine .. but it was a totally manual flight .. no &ldquo;Flight Plan&rdquo; preprogrammed autonomous flight &hellip; That was only after 4-5 manual flights to &ldquo;manual&rdquo; landings. &ldquo;Manual&rdquo; is in quotes, because you cannot land the Disco manually, you have to hit the &ldquo;Land&rdquo; button and the Disco takes over and does a pre-programmed approach and landing FROM THE LOWEST ALLOWED ALTITUDE YOU HAVE SET in the configuration parameters. If you set 100 ft., you can fly the Disco no lower than 100 ft., so you can&rsquo;t descend to a lower altitude and land &hellip; it will take over at 100 ft. &hellip; Hence the recommended lowest altitude setting of 16 ft. &hellip; From that point a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; landing causes the Disco to keep its wings level, gradually descend to about 6 ft., flare, settle and for a brief instant (try to find that anywhere except tech support) reverse its motor to allow a minimum speed landing .. it &ldquo;auto brakes&rdquo; to markedly slow its forward motion.&ldquo;Spiral Landing&rdquo; mode is to be avoided unless you own, or have access to, a 100 acre flat field &hellip; In that situation, from an autonomous Flight Plan flight the Disco does the entire landing from a wide spiral .. so good luck picking a landing spot.A very unusual fact w. the Disco is that you are not flying the aircraft &hellip; you are sending instructions to the autopilot which then flies the plane &hellip; much like modern drones like the military Raptor &hellip; and you can upload a pre-programmed flight plan that the Disco will fly quite nicely .. including altitude changes, different video views, etc&hellip;Parrot needs to revamp its manual &hellip; or have a continuously updated PDF manual online that they should INSIST that users read before flying the Disco .. that would solve 90% of the problems. It is not a simple, intuitive drone like the DJI Phantom, but if you fully understand it, and its limitations, I think users will have an enjoyable experience. Take it out of the box, charge it, and try to fly it with only the packaged documentation and you will be very disappointed.Can&rsquo;t comment on FPV flight as I&rsquo;m not that far yet &hellip; and I&rsquo;ve been flying it for several weeks.</p>

<h5 id="the-disco-is-extremely-user-friendly-and-the-fpv-is-great-when-it-works">The Disco is extremely user friendly and the FPV is great when it works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a complete noob in the aviation community but after watching the Parrot videos I was hooked.I have never been a fan of quadcopters. I&rsquo;ve always wanted an RC Plane that was user friendly and had the FPV capabilities. The Parrot Disco fit the bill.The Disco is extremely user friendly and the FPV is great when it works&hellip; emphasis on when it works. The company advertises a range of 2000 meters but so far I have been unable to take this drone past 700 meters before the connection is broken and the Disco is forced to return home.Video footage begins to hang and become fragmented after 400 meters and then it freezes / disconnects after 500+.I wrote a review on my site at gear-nut dot comThere are some things Parrot is not disclosing that I feel prospective buyers should know about before making the plunge.</p>

<h5 id="nearly-fool-proof-and-all-fun">Nearly fool proof and all fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having flown RC airplanes for 20+ years it took me a bit to understand how this works. I was actually over-flying it on my first flight. Once you let go and allow the Disco to handle throttle on its own it&rsquo;s so simple to fly. I enjoy flying it although landing it in a tight spot is a special challenge - if you&rsquo;re a beginner I suggest a nice open field with no obstacles - especially for your first flight.</p>

<h5 id="this-fixed-wing-is-almost-as-easy-to-fly-as-a-multi-rotor">This fixed wing is almost as easy to fly as a multi-rotor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazingly sophisticated autopilot. This fixed wing is almost as easy to fly as a multi-rotor. Four starts due to poor video range. Parrot should license DJI&rsquo;s lightbridge or equivalent to increase video range.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-wait-for-improvements">Better wait for improvements</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was very fun to use! However I only took it out twice before the sky controller 2 stopped working! Parrot support was friendly but ultimately had no idea what happened or how to fix it so I returned it and planned on purchasing another one&hellip; Until I read the other bad experiences of Disco owners. I&rsquo;ve decided for the same price to purchase the DJI Mavic which will come with 3 batteries!</p>

<p>Not ready for prime time. It is the quickest way to loose $1300.00No support, they will make every effort to avoid fixing damage there app and controller caused.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-out-of-the-box-wing">Excellent out of the box wing!!</h5>
