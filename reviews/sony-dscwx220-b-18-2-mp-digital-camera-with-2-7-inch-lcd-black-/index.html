Product Description
Sony Cyber-shot DSCWX220/B</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Compact Point and Shoot Digital Still Camera
Get the crisp, low-light shots you just can’t capture with your cell phone. With a 10x optical zoom and pocket-sized precision, this Cyber-shot camera will make your cell phone jealous. You’ll also enjoy Full HD video recording and an Exmor R CMOS sensor that immortalizes moments with incredible detail—all in a package that weighs less than most cell phones</p>

<p>Technology</p>

<p>10x Optical / 20x Clear Image Zoom G Lens
Get close with 10x optical zoom plus 20x Clear Image digital zoom. Most digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos.</p>

<p>18.2MP Exmor RCMOS Sensor for superb low light images
This camera features an 18.2 megapixel Exmor R CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera’s G Lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined Exmor R CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processor delivers extremely fast up to 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080p movie modes.</p>

<p>BIONZ X engine for superb detail and noise reduction
Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and still images with the new BIONZ X processor and Optical SteadyShot (Intelligent Active mode). When the processor and image stabilization technology work together they deliver sharp image quality with low noise and minimal blur even while the user is strolling and the camera is zoomed in.</p>

<p>Smooth Full HD video recording in 1080/60p
Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p in 1080 AVCHD video.¹ This provides stunning, fast cinematic video with less distortion for playback on your HDTV.2</p>

<p>Simple connectivity to smartphones via Wi-Fi w/ NFC3
Connectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi w/NFC3 control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, the camera also supports NFC (near field communication) providing “one touch connection” convenience when transferring images to Android smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control — a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone — connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.</p>

<p>Capture the decisive moment with up to 10fps
Capture full 18.2megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Motion Shot Video traces subject movement
A cool effect to show off jumps, tracks, and more. With MotionShot Video, captured subject movement is displayed in a sequence of superimposed images on a single background.</p>

<p>4K quality still image output via HDMI2
Enjoy the beauty of 4K quality still image (4x the resolution of Full HD) via simple HDMI connection to compatible 4K TVs2. The camera can also be connected via HDMI to HDTVs for full HD 1080p resolution images.</p>

<p>Sweep Panorama mode (up to 360°)
Sweep Panorama mode takes our Sweep Panorama function to the next level with the addition of motion compensation. Even when subjects are moving in the foreground of your landscape, these cameras can detect faces and moving subjects, intelligently stitching different widths together to minimize distortion. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360° full circle, the camera can take a variety of panoramic shots.</p>

<p>Picture Effect for more expressive photos
Picture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. There are nine different effects such as partial color to make your focal point stand out, or watercolor which looks like a painting.</p>

<h5 id="comparison-of-sony-cyber-shot-dsc-wx220-vs-canon-powershot-elph-350-hs-vs-canon-powershot-sx610-hs">Comparison of Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX220 vs. Canon Powershot ELPH 350 HS vs. Canon PowerShot SX610 HS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently went looking for a compact budget point-and-shoot camera as a gift for my daughter&rsquo;s birthday and got to play and evaluate the three cameras that were available at the local BestBuy store on sale for under $200:Canon PowerShot ELPH 350 HS (Black)Canon PowerShot SX610 HS - Wi-Fi Enabled (Black)Sony DSCWX220/B 18.2 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)My main criteria for evaluating the relative merits of these cameras was the quality of shots made in low-light situations in which point-and-shoots are often used. In my experience with all the previous budget point-and-shoots owned by our family, they all usually do a relatively decent job in bright light outside, but most fail miserably on indoor shots in dimly lit rooms, delivering unacceptably noisy, grainy and blurry images.After bringing home the purchases I waited till the kids were in bed and went on to conduct a decidedly low-tech and unscientific test by setting all three cameras into the P (Program) mode and auto-everything (ISO/shutter speed/aperture/white balance) except the flash, placing them on the desktop in my not too brightly lit home office a couple of feet away from a random sheet of paper with some text printed on it, and firing off two consecutive shots using a 2-second timer (to avoid hand-induced shake), one with the flash and one without. The image showing a side-by-side comparison of the test results using a small fragment of each frame is attached to this review.Both Canons produced virtually identically grainy and noisy images with and without the flash. Sony, on the other hand, fared much better in terms of the visual noise to the point that it’s actually possible to read the text even on the “no flash” image on the right. It also did a somewhat better job auto-adjusting the white balance on the “no flash” image to compensate for the bluish ambient glow of the nearby computer monitor.I observed similarly noticeable differences between the Sony and the two Canons in the video mode, with the former delivering remarkably noise-free and sharp footage compared to the Canons’ crappy picture in which fine details were lost to annoyingly pulsating digital noise. I also noticed that the Sony’s footage was very close to the brightness and overall colour to how my own eyes perceived the room, while the Canons went overboard in an attempt to brighten up the picture at the expense of noise and colour accuracy.Finally, the Sony is capable of recording 60 fps (frames-per-second) progressive full-HD video vs. the Canons’ 30 fps, making it a better choice for shooting fast action footage such as sports, pets, little children and little children playing with pets.Because of my prior experience with Canon point-and-shoots I found the menu structure of the two Canons easier to navigate. The Sony’s menu navigation seemed a little foreign to me at first but overall is logical enough to quickly get used to.Physically, the Sony is similar in size, weight and holding (dis)comfort to Elph 350, the smaller of the two Canons. Even though I have rather thin fingers for a grown-up male, both cameras are way too tiny and smooth to comfortably hold, with nothing for the fingers to securely grip. In comparison, the contoured bulges and small rubbery finger grips of the larger Canon PowerShot SX610 were a really nice touch.The two Canons have very similar controls typical of all the other Canon point-and-shoots. The controls of the smaller Elph 350 are easier to use than those of the Sony DSC-WX220 where one must use one’s nails to press the tiny delicate MENU and DELETE buttons tucked too close to the rotating wheel. This might make the Sony problematic for most adults, but since I am buying a camera for a kid, its small size and tiny controls are an acceptable trade-off for the noticeably better low-light picture.P.S. The full review is published on my blog: <a href="https://caspiancanuck.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/point-and-shoot-cameras">https://caspiancanuck.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/point-and-shoot-cameras</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this as a starter camera to do YouTube videos and as a point and shoot to take to the park with the family.It was super simple to set up and takes really great photos.I like that it&rsquo;s got a tripod mount on the bottom so I don&rsquo;t have to try to rig it up somewhere like I&rsquo;ve had to do with cameras in the past.It shoots 1080p at 60 frames per second so the videos look like you&rsquo;re actually there instead of feeling like you&rsquo;re watching a video shot with a point and shoot camera.I can control it with my phone! This is great if I want to setup a family photo or if I want to make sure that my YouTube videos are framed correctly while I&rsquo;m in front of the camera.The batteries last quite a bit longer than I thought, but I did opt for a second battery for long afternoons out.Here&rsquo;s an example of a video shot entirely with the WX220: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyMVujts5jA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyMVujts5jA</a></p>

<h5 id="great-camera-for-causual-use">Great camera for causual use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera to replace my previous Sony camera of the same lineage, after the previous camera was dropped on its open lens and would no longer close its lens.I did not buy this camera to use in place of a higher end DSLR, and I do not expect to use it in this manner. I know the camera has limitations, but I also use it for what I believe it is for: A pocket point and shoot camera with higher quality pictures for travel and as a daily, casual camera.For this purpose, I believe this camera takes great pictures. I am still working out some of the features of the camera to adjust pictures taken at night, but I am really happy with the picture quality so far. It has a deeper zoom than my previous camera, so I can actually take closer pictures than my previous Sony camera.I also have no issues regarding the Sony software as I typically take my SD card out and stick it in a card reader. I did test out the wired cable, and while it did install drivers, I actually just accessed my pictures as if it were a USB drive.The camera itself is a little on the gentle side, but I generally keep my camera in a padded leather travel case when not in use, as I have owned higher end cameras and I am well aware of fragility of all cameras and the hardware inside.Updates from the previous model: Most of the features have been combined into the selection dial, which is also a button. The screen is a little bigger. It has a wider zoom. Some of the digital enhancement features offer better stabilization.Regarding some of the issues with night pictures - it seems the camera takes better pictures and uses its own digital aperture sensor to balance the surrounding light in the area to take a better picture. While I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to really play with night pictures, I was able to take some decent pictures of buildings with neon signs, and I only had issues with two of my night time pictures.I have uploaded some pictures with this review - the day light pictures were taken through a window. The evening pictures were taken after 10:00 pm, and the lighting involved is neon, sulfur street lights, and other business lighting. Please note I took the pictures to exclusively test the camera out of the box.Alright, having had some more time to fiddle with the camera, they have completely updated the digital apertures into a user friendly picture menu located under the &ldquo;SCN&rdquo; menu and a few more night shot options are otherwise in the rest of the aperture menu. I was actually able to take some pretty nice night and low light shots, though this camera is intended to be a simple point-n-shoot. I did not need an additional manual, and the aperture menu was easy to navigate, just push the button in the dial and move the dial up or down to find what one needs to use.</p>
