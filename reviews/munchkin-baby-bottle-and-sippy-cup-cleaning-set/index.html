<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="daily-product-is-sturdy-and-so-useful">Daily product is sturdy and so useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t register for this, but received one as a baby gift anyways from a cousin who had one. Had I known how much I would use it and how invaluable it would be to me, I would have definitely asked for it! It took me a minute to set it up, but once I figured it out it was good to go. My daughter is now 15 months and I&rsquo;m still using it. It holds glass bottles, breastpump parts, baby food jars, bottle nipples/lids - I even use it to dry other smaller things I handwash, like my noodle spiraler. It takes up very little room on the counter - about the size of a coffeepot, and the arms are very sturdy. The brush cleaners are high quality too and I&rsquo;ve had no problems with them.I have a baby shower I&rsquo;m attending soon - I will be giving one of these to the parents-to-be!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-handy">Very handy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this after reading many reviews and I am not disappointed.Out of the box I was a bit confused as to how to set this up because some of the arms didnt &ldquo;click&rdquo; and I had no idea what I was doing wrong. I no longer recall if there were instructions or not, but I didnt read it. It took probably 5 minutes and it was ready.It is capable of holding a lot of bottles, nipples, caps, etc. it rotates from the top and you can also rotate the white bottom part to make the whole thing rotate. I have had over 10 bottles and this holds up pretty well.I dont know about glass bottles, but I have used it for the shaker bottle I use to premix the formula and it does not have an issue staying in place.If I ever need another one, I will be sure to get this same product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-would-buy-it-again-if-necessary">Love! Would buy it again if necessary.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I would do without this drying rack. I LOVE IT! Not only does it add a bit of character to the countertop, but it functions very well. There is a cup in the middle to hold smaller items and spoons. There are two &ldquo;tree&rdquo; sections - one perfect for large bottles and one perfect for smaller bottles. Both of these &ldquo;tree&rdquo; sections spin so you can easily access something on the back of the rack. The bottom white tray also spins. It has varying sized holes to hold different bottle and pacifier pieces in place. Only one recommendation - if you are pumping AND bottle feeding, I&rsquo;d recommend 2 racks. One for pumping equipment and one for bottles. I only had one, but I ended up needing a little more space for some of the pieces. (Oh - I use Dr. Browns bottles so there are a few more pieces to care for.) If you are only bottle feeding or only pumping, one rack will be sufficient. I have 5 Dr. Brown&rsquo;s bottles that I use non-stop. the rack is perfect for all 5 clean bottles and a few pacifiers. As my little one gets bigger and starts eating solid foods, I may find that a second rack is necessary. If that is the case, I will be buying a second one of these. No question! Love it.</p>

<h5 id="love-it-so-much-i-bought-another">Love it so much I bought another</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this sprout drying rack, I bought another and have recommended it to pregnant friends. It&rsquo;s the size of a round dinner plate. It has 6 arms on two layers (total of 12 arms) plus the cup at the top and the white flat tray at the bottom. I use Dr. Brown&rsquo;s Glass bottles and it holds them and all the accessories. I&rsquo;ve use one rack in the kitchen for the bottles, and one rack in the bathroom after cleaning my pump parts.For the bottles, It holds both the 8oz and the 4oz bottles very well, it has slots for the &ldquo;travel discs&rdquo; to stand vertical (think of an upright penny), and it also has small posts that you can put the brown/tan vents on so that they stand up to dry. Will hold 6 bottles for sure, haven&rsquo;t had the need to try for 12. I try to put my bottles on the top arms and the rings and nipples on the bottom arms, with the blue straws in the cups and the white cap/lids and the tan vents on the tray. Works well.For the pump parts, it holds 3 sets of parts (I use the medela pump). I have 2 sets with the removable breast shields and one set of the Maymom integrated shields. With 3 sets drying, it gets a little crowded, but it&rsquo;s better than having to lay everything out on a towel and then having things get condensation in it. Each pump set, I also have (2 )4oz bottles that I pump in to (per set), so those go on the top arms.I&rsquo;m super happy with this purchase. I bought it versus some other models due to the amazon reviews, and I&rsquo;m glad i did.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="super-cute-and-coordinates-with-the-boon-lawn">Super cute, and coordinates with the Boon Lawn!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A really functional bottle drying rack, plus it looks cute in a whimsical kind of way! We have been using it extensively since the birth of our first baby, for drying bottles, nipples, pump parts, pacifiers, etc. It has a good amount of space for loading it up with multiple bottles, and the various levels make it easy to keep things separate enough and positioned in such a way that they dry thoroughly and quickly.For me, it helps that it looks like a cute little plant or flower thing sitting on the counter, instead of like a more plain, white industrial-type bottle rack. We have a Boon Lawn (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boon-Grass-Countertop-Drying-Green/dp/B0032G9E0G/">http://www.amazon.com/Boon-Grass-Countertop-Drying-Green/dp/B0032G9E0G/</a>) too, and on the counter top it looks like the two items coordinate together. Makes the kitchen counter look more like a little garden than just a baby dishes drying area. Also, very reasonably priced for a drying rack!Definitely happy with my purchase, and I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to give this as a baby shower gift to anyone who is expecting since it is very practical and necessary.</p>
