<h5 id="good-keyboard-but-bulky-overall">Good keyboard but bulky overall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cooper Cases&trade; Touchpad Executive Lenovo A10-70 A7600 / Tab 2 A10-70 Tablet Bluetooth Keyboard Folio in Purple (Removable QWERTY Keyboard; Built-in Stand; Rechargeable Battery)The keyboard has all the keys including function keys and they are well spaced with a good feel- rugged enough considering the form factor. Once paired with blue tooth, I was able to switch the KB on and off and it works without intervention although it may take a few seconds after turning on to be recognized. The mouse action can sometimes be sluggish and the touch screen still works to supplement the touch pad.The case with the tablet feels heavier and bulkier(thicker) than I would like. I ordered the blue color and it is a good shade of blue, rather neutral which is exactly what I was looking for. The tablet fits well with the elastic clips and the finish is good.I wish that the keyboard was also attached with clips (or push buttons on bottom) so it wouldn&rsquo;t move relative to the case. The advantage of magnets is you can carry a couple of pages of documents between the keyboard and the case ! The stand is not as adjustable as it may seem because it only supports one height/angle. When the case is closed, the tablet and keyboard meet haphazardly such that some of the keys gets pressed; this is because the case folds like a book but the binding in not rigid. Moreover the keyboard itself shifts.My suggestion would be to use an acrylic hinge to make the case follow a more predictable folding path. Also make the hinges like a notebook&rsquo;s hinges so tablet converts to a notebook- then you can place it in your lap which the current design does not allow.It took about 2 weeks from order to delivery (came from Hong Kong, standard shipping).</p>

<h5 id="love-this-case-keyboard">Love this Case &amp; Keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this case and keyboard. Though it does not rotate to allow the screen to be in portrait position and still be attached via the rubber holders, I use it in Portrait position by setting it on the case and usig the keyboard to hold it in place. The tablet holders are very sturdy and much easier to use then in other cases I have experienced.The leather case is leather, and it is very smart looking. Keyboard and Tablet fold up easily in it. The keyboard is magnetic and is very secure, but can be removed without a problem if need be.I was doing something incorrect in the beginning when trying to pair the keybored and the company responded to my email right away. Great customer followup from the seller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-wish-it-would-have-worked-for-me">Good Product! Wish it would have worked for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. I really liked this product but the case did not have the hole for the camera that was on the back of my tablet and I do use the camera. Other than that I would highly recommend this case. It was well built and worked really nice. Also when I returned it they gave me no hassle</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="case-coming-apart-brand-new">Case coming apart (brand new)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The metal backing arrived unglued and coming apart. Not impressed with it &ldquo;tis case at all. I was excited to get it with a keypad, mouse and case all in one. I wouldn&rsquo;t reccomend this. Will be contacting buyer about this problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case-for-the-price-impressed">Great case for the price..impressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great case for the price. I had used quite a lot of cases earlier and they wear off easily or have limited functionalities. This one surpasses the others by miles.Firstly you will get a perfect fit for the note 10.1 tab unlike most cases. Most others are generic and almost never fits any tab perfectly.Secondly the quality of Bluetooth keyboard is great&hellip;good ergonomics, great power backup, nicely positioned keys and large keys that helps in typing.The tab and the keyboard can be together in the case and be closed with a nice flap and a slot on the order side that&rsquo;s tightly goes in so that it doesn&rsquo;t slack and come out during movements, which could cause a lot of damage to the tablet if it fell. The design protects it.The material quality is good and won&rsquo;t wear off on a long time.Overall I think this is a great value for money and glad I chose it after researching a lot and even returning one from best buy.Did I tell you that the colored ones looks more elegant than the generic black ones in the market?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-and-functionality-for-my-money">Great Value and Functionality for My Money!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My tablet (an ASUS ZenPad 10) fit perfectly and pairing it with the keyboard was a piece of cake. The keyboard has &ldquo;well-defined&rdquo; (i.e., like a laptop rather than, say, the nastiness that is your microwave&rsquo;s &ldquo;buttons&rdquo;) keys which have good tactile feel/feedback and function as expected.I charged the keyboard overnight &ldquo;just to be sure&rdquo; before I used it; the accompanying documentation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Charging the Keyboard&rdquo; section conflicts with itself by suggesting/requiring a six [6] hour initial charge in step #1 and then in step #5 saying charge until the charging status light goes off which &ldquo;usually takes around 2 hours&rdquo;. I concluded that I should charge for 6 hours initially (or if I start having problems like repeating keystrokes or missing keys) but in normal use just charge until the charging indicator lamp goes out.Barring future unexpected problems this product is definitely five (5) stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-product">Solid Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the product via Prime shipping which was great. I researched a stand extensively because my Samsung galaxy note 10.1 is a few years old (2013 or 2014?), so there were not many options for well reviewed keyboards. The keyboard synced relatively easily with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. The keyboard is attached to the case via magnets which are pretty stable. I find the foldable kick stand on the back of the stand a little less sturdy then I would like, however with some manipulation I was have my tablet propped up properly. This is a recently new purchase, so I can&rsquo;t speak yet to battery life, but the keyboard did charge pretty easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-2-issues-with-it">Not bad&hellip; 2 issues with it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So the keyboad is really nice and the case overall is pretty good. Two issues with it, one major, one minor. The first minor issue is that there is no spot for a pen or any cards. Again, minor issue. The major issue is that the stand for the tablet isn&rsquo;t adjustable at all. The fixed position makes it difficult unless you&rsquo;re sitting just at the right height. I find myself wedging my phone or a book under the stand. Over all, a good case though for the money!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Returned it. Believe I am still looking for my credit</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is more of a &ldquo;one size fits most&rdquo; case, but it works VERY well for my ASUS tablet.</p>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>clip broke after a couple uses and not able to return or exchange</p>

<p>Is good cover I like it</p>

<h5 id="okay-product-needs-a-little-bit-of-work">Okay product. Needs a little bit of work.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An otherwise a decent product, the magnetic part has a tendency to fall off when ruffed up a little bit. Also you cant take photos when the case is on the tablet.</p>
