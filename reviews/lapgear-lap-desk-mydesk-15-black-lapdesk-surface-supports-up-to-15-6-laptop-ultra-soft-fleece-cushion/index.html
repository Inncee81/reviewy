<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="this-college-girl-loves-this-desk">This College Girl Loves This Desk!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for both gaming (because the bottom of my laptop tends to get hot) and school work (because I like sitting on the couch and my lap is too low)! The second I put this on my lap I fell in love. My laptop has little skid-proof spots on the bottom so no issues with the sliding some people mentioned. Worth the price! I wanted something simple and comfortable but didn&rsquo;t like the prices of the other lap desks. This is absolutely perfect. I raved so much about mine that my boyfriend bought one too so now we can game side by side on the couch!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightweight-durable-and-easy-to-clean-heavily-kid-tested-still-excellent-after-3-years">Lightweight, durable and easy to clean. Heavily kid-tested! Still excellent after 3 years</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these, in aqua and green, for my kids (aged 4 and 6 at the time) to use in the car three years ago. I could not be more pleased. They were both in booster seats and they fit very well over the arms. They used them for activities, they have little cubbies for crayons and markers to keep them from rolling away. We used them for an eating surface when they had snacks in the car. These lapdesks are very durable and easy to clean. Over 3 years later they are still used almost every day. They use them to color or write or do homework outside when they are sitting on the sidewalk or lawn and inside sprawled on the floor or couch. The padding on the underside has held up extremely well despite the nearly constant use. I am finally picking up a third one so I don&rsquo;t have to hear grumbling when I need one!</p>

<h5 id="great-desk-for-my-envy-15-with-little-room-to-spare-gets-the-job-done">Great desk for my ENVY 15 with little room to spare. Gets the job done.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of continuously using my detachable food tray for my laptop lap desk, I decided to buy this one because of the price and good reviews. This lap desk is exactly what I needed. Although I thought it would be a little bigger, it fits my ENVY 15 with about an inch on both sides and in the back. The surface is a little slick, but with the grips on my laptop I can rest assured that my laptop won&rsquo;t slip off. I would be worried about putting any device that doesn&rsquo;t have any type of grip on it however. I&rsquo;m using the lap desk as we speak to write this review. The bottom has beaded cushions for your lap, so you can surf the web with comfort on your lap.I take away one star for its slickness and its size, but I&rsquo;m overall satisfied with my lap desk. A good buy for me!</p>

<h5 id="cheap-plastic">Cheap plastic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is cheap plastic junk, it is so slippery, everything slides right off. Not made for adults, and not worth the money. I bought a real nice one at Costco, for the same price, with 3&rdquo; memory foam,wrist rest, and a light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="light-durable-great-product">Light &amp; Durable - Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my wife who uses a 10&rdquo; tablet with a keyboard. Have had this for a couple weeks now and it works great.I started using it for my 15.5&rdquo; laptop too.I especially appreciate that it keeps the heat off of my lap when using the laptop. The rubber pads on the bottom of my laptop grip nicely to the platform surface and keep it from sliding. I find that it keeps my keyboard at a nice angle too.In addition to using it as her tablet/keyboard platform, my wife likes to put her phone in one of the pockets. She also like to use it when she does adult coloring because you can put colored pencils in the pockets and the platform is a nice size for most art designs.This product is light and seems to be very durable.The pads on the bottom seem to be filled with small foam beads similar to an old bean bag. Works great for this application.</p>

<h5 id="this-lap-desk-had-so-many-good-reviews-that-i-bought-it">This lap desk had so many good reviews that I bought it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lap desk had so many good reviews that I bought it, but apparently my expectations were too high. Prior, I had a compsite wooden one that was much heavier, and also much larger surface area. I was annoyed by the weight and size which is why I thought this one would be better, but it&rsquo;s not. I actually find this one to feel a bit flimsy, and the texture surface constantly makes my laptop slide off, whereas the smooth, wooden surface I had prior never did that to my laptop. I&rsquo;ll keep this one until it breaks (hopefully soon?) and then go with something sturdier. My guess is, if you&rsquo;ve never had a lapdesk you&rsquo;ll love this one, but if you have, this one will feel inferior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="light-compact-lap-desk">Light, Compact Lap Desk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love this Lap Desk. Using it right now, in fact. I was surprised how very light it is. I use this with my 2 in 1, 13&rdquo; laptop. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit with a little bit of space on each side (about 2.5&rdquo; towards the top of the desk). Slots at the top will fit any size smartphone and maybe a 7&rdquo; tablet. (It was a too small for my 8.4&rdquo; Samsung.) It can also be used as a writing or drawing desk, or maybe for crafts or reading. I also haven&rsquo;t had an issue with my laptop sliding off, but I keep it pretty flat on my lap. Sure, if I lift my knees way up and tilt the desk, the laptop would slide down, but who sits that way? If I use a mouse, I usually just keep it on the bed or sofa next to me. Otherwise, the mouse does tend to slide.I purchased the basic black, because the color I wanted wasn&rsquo;t available. But I think I like the black much better. It&rsquo;s size, weight and handle at the top makes it very easy to move, carry and store. Hope that helps.</p>

<h5 id="great-gift-for-my-teen-daughter">Great Gift for my teen daughter!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice for a lapdesk. The cushion on the bottom is thick without being too thick. Totally would buy again from this company. My daughter is fifteen and totally loves this desk to sit and watch tv and do homework on this.I wrote this review without any incentive to purchase the item. I really enjoy completing reviews and do so only after having (or a family member does) tested a product thoroughly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was just ok and not what I was looking for. I returned it to order a different style.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars-1">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Smaller than the very same lap desk I ordered about a year ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fabulous-lap-desk">FABULOUS LAP DESK!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THIS LAP DESK IS WONDERFUL&hellip;MY 15&rdquo; FITS PERFECTLY AND THERE IS EVEN ROOM FOR THE MOUSE OFF TO THE RIGHT&hellip;IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE ON MY LAP TOO&hellip;</p>
