<h5 id="read-before-you-buy">READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These goggles are great just make sure you get the right kind!!! It doesn&rsquo;t tell you when you buy it but when it comes in the box, the box reads different numbers corresponding with what the goggles are best used for. These numbers are from 0-2. 0 being at night, and 2 being in the day. These numbers are important because sun reflects of the snow so the number 2 is the best for day. As for night the sun does not so 0 would be the best. The color Vermillon is a 2, the Lemon is a 1 and the Clear is a 0. These goggles are great but it doesnt tell you so hope you find this helpful. The goggles take 1-3 days to ship.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-eye-protection-for-snow-sports">Perfect eye protection for snow sports!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved these, they were just what I needed and worked wonderful for my first ski trip to Colorado! Really good quality goggles for the price. No scratches and no steaming up! The goggles stayed clear when skiing and dog sledding with the wind blowing like crazy. Also, I had no issues with them fogging up when moving indoors from outdoors. The goggles were very comfortable and kept my eyes warm, if that makes sense. Overall, I would definitely recommend these, especially if you will only be using them for the occasional vacation. I won&rsquo;t be using them all the time, so I can&rsquo;t say how well they would hold up with excessive use, but for a trip skiing once a year they were perfect!!! And you really CAN NOT beat that price!!Quick note-I rely greatly on customer reviews when I am looking to purchase an item, and I know others do too, so I try to be as thorough and honest in giving it as possible. I put a lot of thought into my review and appreciate feedback, so if you have found my review helpful, please take a moment to click on &ldquo;yes” to let me know. Thanks so much for reading and feel free to ask me any questions! :)</p>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price-but-outdated-model-doesn-t-compare">Great for the price, but outdated model doesn&rsquo;t compare&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two different pairs of Bolle Goggles, the Mojo and the Carve. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on these. The Carves are often times only $5-10 more than the Mojo and there is a WORLD of difference between the two. I&rsquo;ll start with the positives of the Mojo then move on to the differences.The Mojo frame is grippy and I like that! It&rsquo;s not a hard slippery plastic, which when you have thick gloves on is impossible to grab. Bolle seems to have figured this out quickly as it appears to be the standard frame on all their models. The lens is huge and clear! You can&rsquo;t really see any part of the frame in your view which is also perfect. I bought the citrus color lens and while it does look red inside the box, once you put them on it is CLEARLY orange. While I did this on accident and I don&rsquo;t recommend it, I was able to look almost directly at the sun without a problem, so the darkness of the lens is almost perfect for a sunny/partly cloudy day as others have said. They are rated S.2 which fits the description for the weather and view perfectly. On to the differences&hellip;First off, the padding on the Mojo is just cheap scratchy foam. It&rsquo;s breathable like all of their foam but the carve has a nice, soft felt lining on the part that touches your face. With the Mojo your face will be itchy from the moment you put these on.Secondly, the Carve has a double band system which makes it extremely easy to tighten and loosen. What I mean by this is there are two plastic connectors on the back instead of one. With the Mojo you have to pull on one side of the strap, slide the connecter the opposite direction, then adjust the strap on the frame. With the Carves you just grab both plastic pieces, pull them to opposite sides, and done.Overall, the price you probably pay for the Mojo and the quality of the lenses you get are adequate, but they simply don&rsquo;t compare when you put them up against the newer model Carves. In comparison, the Mojos feel like prototypes for the Carves. You get what you pay for with these though which is why I still give them 4-stars.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="amazing-goggles-would-buy-again">Amazing goggles! Would buy again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just wore these on the mountain today for the first time while it was snowing hard. Love them!!! I got the Vermilion ones. The color was perfect to enhance and show me any areas of concern in the snow like dips or ice. The best thing about them was that they did not fog at all!!! It was great. Skiing with them on was so clear that it was easily to forget that I was wearing them at all. They looked stylish and sleek on and stayed nicely on my helmet when I wasn&rsquo;t wearing them. At an excellent price, overall this is a win.</p>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny-while-working-outside-in-mn">Worth every penny while working outside (in MN)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been very happy with the anti-fog coating. This has a single pane lens, and i was afraid wearing them with a ski mask would fog the lens. I used to wear sunglasses to when working outside, now i wear these goggles and my face feels much warmer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="description-incomplete-these-are-for-partly-cloudy-days">Description Incomplete &ndash; These are for Partly Cloudy Days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The goggles seem fine and the price is right, however, be aware that these goggles are for &ldquo;Partly Cloudy&rdquo; exposure. The product description at Amazon fails to give any of this information. According to the packaging, goggles are rated by the percentage of visible light transmitted through the lenses. These goggles are &ldquo;S-2&rdquo; meaning they permit 37% of visible light through &ndash; which is rated sufficient for partly cloudy days. For full sun, you need goggles that allow &lt;20% of visible light. Would be helpful if the description said these were &ldquo;S-2&rdquo; and &ldquo;party cloudy&rdquo; goggles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good-beginner-goggles">Pretty good beginner goggles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are very simple goggles for snowboarding or skiing and work as they need to. You could probably use these for other windy and snowy days that you want to protect your eyes from the weather.They are good fitting to fit all helmets and have a good amount of grip on them to stay in place on the helmet and face. The clarity is very good when its not to sunny out and provide a full amount of view through the goggles. They also keep the fog out fairly well with some short times it would fog and not impact vision much at all. These is also somethings a glare if you hit the sun just right which can be annoying sometimes.I would only get these if you need something for the short term and need some beginner goggles to start. Later on I would invest in some nicer ones that are maybe polarized.</p>
