<h5 id="better-looking-than-in-pictures">Better Looking than in pictures&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice compact design with a nice shiny white finish. At first I was hesitant because I thought it looked like a cheap 5 dollar power strip in the pictures but it&rsquo;s actually way nicer looking in person. It goes well in either of my &ldquo;tech&rdquo; vehicles. Glad I bought this opposed to the others that look like a cheesy version of a car stereo amplifier. Perfect for charging iPads on the go or powering laptop on a long road trip. WAY OFF TOPIC: but I&rsquo;m laughing at reviews asking whether or not they can power a portable electric grill&hellip;. Buy a Honda eu2000 generator! I have the 1200 dollar camouflage version, it is wonderful and I can even charge 5,000 mAh/ 50c / 14S LiPo batteries (x2 batteries) simultaneously with Honda eu2000&gt;HP Server 1800 watt power supply to 24V &gt; iCharger 4010Duo in 15 min at 15 amps per each LiPo battery. Could actually do 22+ amps but do not prefer to push it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-it">Buy It</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used this for three things: 1. Charging two Nexus 4 Android devices via the 2.1 ports and a radio transmitter via the 1.0 port. 2. Powering/charging my laptop. 3. Powering a 500w PA, large amp, and electronic drum pad (all at the same time, no joke) for playing music outside. I use this thing constantly. It has never let me down and has lasted a very long time; I&rsquo;m still using it today. The fan is a little loud when you turn the switch on, BUT you can use all USB ports WITHOUT turning the switch on. I don&rsquo;t think most people know that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="needed-this-for-our-drive-into-town">Needed this for our drive into town</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We drive at least an hour from our home to dance class once a week. My girls love to play on their laptops. However the battery was always dead by the time we would drive the hour back home. This is a life saver. I would definitely recommend this. We recently used this on a five hour road trip and never had one problem with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-exactly-what-it-says-without-fail-great-product">Does exactly what it says without fail. Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had wired this into my 2015 171 R-Pod camp trailer. The wife watches a lot of TV at night, and we never camp where there is shore power. Also, I wanted some USB plugs to keep the phones and walkie talkies charged. It&rsquo;s mounted on the wall and looks/works terrific. Great product very well build.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-pitched-whine-when-turned-on-non-replacable-fuse-plenty-of-plugs">High pitched whine when turned on, non-replacable fuse, plenty of plugs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Others have mentioned that this thing is noisy and they are right. Which wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if it was a low volume, or a low pitched noise. But unfortunately, it is a high pitch whine which means that it&rsquo;s very easy to hear above the road noise (which tends to be lower pitch, more bass sounds). If the noise was lower pitched, it would easily be covered up by the road noise, but as it is, I originally thought there was a problem with my car! Extremely annoying.Second, the fuse is SOLDERED onto the motherboard. This means that if you accidentally blow the fuse, then you&rsquo;ll most likely be replacing the whole device instead of just the fuse (unless you are good with soldering).One thing going for it is that it does have a lot of plugs for the price. In the end, I will be returning this as I just cannot stand the noise!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works really good. I feel like it doesn&rsquo;t seem good enough to handle a lo of strong power consuming items, but I thing one power consuming item should be good. I used this to bring a VCR out to my van that has a flip down dvd screen and video/audio hookup an watched VHS movies out there. It worked fine, and i was also able to charge my phone. Couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better cheap product that does what it is supposed to do and works great. Even has a little fan that runs in it to keep it from getting to hot. I wouldn&rsquo;t let it stay on if it is a really hot day and especially i your not in the car. it does have its own power switch on it. Fan is pretty quiet, you can hear it bu its not loud enough to be annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product makes a very loud noise when it&rsquo;s plugged in. Also, when I plugged it into my truck it interfered with the radio so no stations came in. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s fully functional and great for charging cell phones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-reason-this-wouldn-t-deserve-5-stars-for-me">No reason this wouldn&rsquo;t deserve 5-stars for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As many others may have mentioned this is not a pure sine wave AC power inverter. But then again, it&rsquo;s only twenty five bucks. I purchased this for powering chargers and basic electronics in the car for road trips, and does that extremely well.Knowing what it is, and not setting my expectations for anything else, I can&rsquo;t find any reasons to give it less than 5 stars. It&rsquo;s compact, the plug is really solid, it&rsquo;s a great value, and pacifies kids in the car.Product description is very detailed and seems to clearly and honestly communicate the limitations and caveats that so many other reviewers have complained about. The fan does make some noise (because it&rsquo;s a fan). The item description clearly sets the expectation that it does have a cooling fan and it will make noise when t&rsquo;s on. I just made sure to put this under the seat in the car, where it could still get good ventilation and none of us even noticed it. Especially over the road noise. It&rsquo;s just a trade-off for convenience of having power where you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sure there are people out there who buy gas generators and are surprised to discover that they are loud.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-nice-and-compact">Its nice and compact</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its nice and compact, great for charging your phones and other devices on the go. Use it all the time for the long trips.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Made my engine light come on!!!!!!!!!! When turning the power button on it kept making weird noises.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-two-months">Good for two months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved this charger at first but three months after purchasing it, the fan has become really loud and whiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy customer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this on a long car ride, has a decent sized cable and I never was worried my phone battery was going to die! Thanks for a great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well">Works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately I wish the cable was hard-wired into it and not easy to disconnect. Looks like other models out there are wired directly into the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-useful">Very useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly and does exactly what i bought it for. so many ports and outlets makes this perfect for me, i have no complaints from this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-opened-up-possibilities-for-us">works well! opened up possibilities for us!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son has cystic fibrosis and must do many treatments throughout the day, some of which require AC power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very handy for long road trips. Was able to charge 2 phones and laptop no problem. I like that it fits in the cubby in my dash.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-usb-ports-work">NO USB PORTS WORK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I went to plug in my phone to the USB ports and none of them work. The same USB cord and cigarette lighter work with my other power inverter</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-didn-t-get-to-use-it-because-it-didn-t">I didn&rsquo;t get to use it, because it didn&rsquo;t &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to use it, because it didn&rsquo;t come with the power cord for using it in my truck. If I was to receive this cord. I would probably give it 5 stars.</p>
