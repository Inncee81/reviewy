<h5 id="good-quality-just-be-sure-it-s-a-good-fit-for-your-setup">Good quality, just be sure it’s a good fit for your setup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beyond having the most awesome name ever (a cross between a vortex and a tornado??), this fan is pretty nice. My wife told me that the women at her work (in a dental office) use these fans on a daily basis. It helps to keep them cool while not being too loud or overpowering for the patients.It was smaller than I expected; having looked at the photos rather than the dimensions. Because of this, I’m posting a picture of it next to a pop/soda can; hopefully that will give you a good visual scale. Small isn’t necessarily bad because small may very well be what you are looking for. It is a desk fan, after all, and on a desk it is just the right size. Quiet enough to not drown out phone conversations, yet strong enough to provide a decent breeze.Speaking of breeze, the fan has two speeds. (1) Slow (very slow), which is perfect if it is sitting right next to you on a desk (and you want to mitigate noise), and (2) Fast, which is really a medium speed. I could feel the air pushed toward me comfortably at about 8 feet away. Any further showed cutting limits on airflow; the right proximity is everything.The fan noise on the top speed is soothing; good for falling asleep to. But might be too loud for some situations; such as in an office cubicle where your neighbor does not want to hear the fan at all.My only real complaint with this fan is the limited positioning rotation. It works well if you are level with it, or if it is below you. However, if you want to place it on a dresser and point it down toward your bed, look elsewhere. This fan is designed to be compact and fold up nicely, but the foldable stand limits any forward tilt. This makes sense as, if you look at the picture, a forward tilt with that stand would cause the weight to be unbalanced and the fan to fall over.Overall, this is a nice compact solution. Soft fan noise, decent air cutting, and good quality build. Perfect for close quarters, but limited on forward tilt. Depending on your setup, this would either be the best of fans or just a poor fit. It all depends on how you want to use it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I travel with a fan, not just for moving air, but also for the noise it makes to sleep by. This is a perfectly portable fan. It is not too thick as to take up a lot of suitcase room and also the base folds up to pack easily. It has 2 speeds and makes a nice light noise and will move the air. I have bought 2 so far and will probably buy a third. It also makes a good gift for people who travel. It might be a few ounces heavier than you would expect but it is a Vornado and has the power to move the air in this small fan.</p>

<h5 id="inconsistent-airflow">inconsistent airflow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this travel fan because of its small size and good reviews. I use a fan for white noise when I sleep, plus air circulation. Unfortunately, this fan generates VERY inconsistent airflow. It modulates constantly as if someone where changing the speed. It was very distracting&ndash;too much to be good as white noise. I tried out 2 of these and they both did it. I returned them. If the fan produced even sound and air, this would have been a 5 star fan. Note that I am VERY sensitive to this white noise issue, so your experience my vary. Other fans I have used do not do this. I purchased the Miady 7.5&rdquo; fan and I REALLY like it.</p>

<h5 id="we-only-buy-vornado-fans">We only buy Vornado fans&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been a fan of Vornado primarilly because we use to live near the city where their company is based out of, PLUS they make a sold product. They have been in biz since the 1940&rsquo;s.There are people I&rsquo;ve met back up in Kansas, where we used to live, who collect original Vornado fans from the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s. They are a little obsessed:)This little fan folds down all the way to then be able to be put in a back pack or suitcase. It&rsquo;s quiet and moves a lot of air for its size. It&rsquo;s made in China.SteveAustin, Texas</p>

<h5 id="almost-perfect-travel-fan">Almost perfect travel fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace a folding fan I use when traveling that was lost.Pros: This is a much better fan than the one I had. It is well constructed and has 2 speeds. The high speed is the perfect noise level to sleep. It is just loud enough to mute all of the unfamiliar noises at a hotel but not deafening. The little legs are sturdier than they look in the picture and fold back flat against the fan for storage. It is compact enough to sit on a window sill. I want it mostly for the background noise but it would be effective for air movement in a small space like a work table or desk. The price was higher than I really wanted to pay but I expect this to last a long time.Cons: The size and weight descriptions given by Amazon are correct so this is really on me. It is heavier than you would expect and larger than I really want to put in a carry on. I would hesitate to put it in a checked bag because it is a really nice item and could be stolen and would be expensive to replace if your luggage was lost (like mine).I will take this with me on road trips where size and weight of luggage isn&rsquo;t an issue but will continue to search for the perfect travel fan.</p>

<h5 id="great-fan-for-daughters-room">Great fan for Daughters Room</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice and small little fan. We put it in our daughters room and run it on the table next to her bed. She likes it because of the color and I like it because it provides some white noise for her as she sleeps. It&rsquo;s not as loud as other fans we have in the house, but just enough. I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to put this on a desk at work or somewhere else (though I would personally get a different color for myself). It seems to be pretty well made and folds nicely.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="saved-the-day-in-italy-heat-wave">Saved the day in Italy heat wave</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan saved me during our two week trip through Italy during record high temperatures. The Italians are not well known for their air conditioning, so many of our rooms were warm and stuffy, even with their so-called A/C. The VORNADO helped to move the air around enough to cool us and make sleeping much easier. It provides just the right amount of &ldquo;white noise&rdquo; also&hellip; not too loud, but moves decent air volume. My only con is the almost unbelievable fact that the fan cannot be switched to the European 220V system. I had to carry a power transformer around just for this fan. Pretty odd for a so-called &ldquo;Travel Fan&rdquo;.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-nifty-little-fan-that-really-is">Excellent, &lsquo; nifty &rsquo; little fan that really is &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent, &lsquo; nifty &rsquo; little fan that really is that proverbial &lsquo; mouse that roars &lsquo;. WELL worth the money and &hellip; the shipping etc. was as good as it gets !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="rip-off">Rip off</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Blew out in less than one minute! I bought this for a once in a life time trip to Italy. Plugged it in and in less than 2 minutes I smelled the motor burn out and it stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-air-flow-and-compact">Nice air flow and compact.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked perfectly on family trip- folded nicely in my suitcase and didn&rsquo;t take up too much room. Does have some humming noise, but that is what I wanted to drown out what I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>nice size, not too loud, fits well on my night stand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this fan from Fry&rsquo;s Electronics. While quiet and compact, it doesn&rsquo;t move nearly enough air to be worth the $27.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-in-my-suitcase-very-nicely-easy-to-clean">fits in my suitcase very nicely! Easy to clean</h5>

<p>Works well, fits in my suitcase very nicely! Easy to clean!</p>

<p>Finally went on the trip I purchased this item for&hellip;&hellip; Plugged it in&hellip;.. it ran very loudly for about 5 minutes then died! Soooo very disappointed!</p>

<h5 id="great-desk-fan">Great desk fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very small but very powerful. Perfect for the desk!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="conistent-with-the-descriptions">Conistent with the descriptions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace a fan that I loved but it finally quit. This fan is handy - small, not too noisy and moves enough air to be effective in a limited space.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan barely works. I do not recommend it at all. In fact, when it is on, I can&rsquo;t tell it&rsquo;s on. Even on the high setting. Very disappointed. It is more of a paper weight.</p>
