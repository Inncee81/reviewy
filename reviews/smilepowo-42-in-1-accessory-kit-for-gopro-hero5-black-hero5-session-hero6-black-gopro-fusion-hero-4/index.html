<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-set-lacks-a-manual">Good set, lacks a manual</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had a GoPro for about 6 months now, it&rsquo;s my very first one and I am not a professional by any means. I ordered three different accessory kits at the same time, all with a similar list of items included, one had a couple of screws more but was priced higher and another one had about 20 things less and cost 25 bucks instead of 30. Im thinking this one might be the best deal, its well priced (29.99) and you get everything you need.All of that said, there is one major flaw in all of them, especially if you are a beginner like me: absolutely no instructions whatsoever, not in the case, not in the listing. Some of the items are self-explanatory (tripod, selfie stick, chest band, suction cup etc) but there are SO MANY various screws that I have no clue what to do with, I might actually Youtube a tutorial.All of the items seem to be universal when it comes to GoPro&rsquo;s so they will fit any type that you may have. Everything is wrapped separately in little zip lock baggies.The case measures: 9&rdquo; x 13&rdquo; x 3&rdquo;This accessory kit contains 42 items (the case fits all of them but once you take them out, its kind of hard to put everything back in and be able to zip it up):1 x Head Belt Strap Mount1 x Chest Belt Strap Mount1 x Wrist Strap Mount1 x Wrist Strap for Remote Control1 x 360 Degree Rotating Backpack Clip Mount1 x Helmet Strap Mount1 x Bike Handlebar Holder Mount2 x Bike Handlebar Holder Mount Adapter1 x Car Suction Cup Mount2 x Car Suction Cup Adapter1 x Extendable Handle Monopod2 x Handle Monopod Adapter1 x Floating Handle Grip1 x Floating Block2 x Surface Quick Release Buckle2 x Long Thumbscrew2 x Flat Mount2 x Arc Mount5 x Adhesive Pad1 x Insurance Tether Strap12 x Anti-fog Insert1 x Large Carrying Case1 x Tripod1 x Phone ClampLike I said above, there are other sets on the market that contain more items (49 in 1), but they are usually 3-10 bucks more expensive, the quality is exactly the same or worse and all you get on top of all thats in this set is more fog inserts and various screws, most of which you may not even need.Overall I am satisfied with the amount of accessories, the way they are wrapped and the quality, however I do urge the seller / manufacturer to add a good, well written instruction manual with suggestions for use.</p>

<h5 id="comes-with-a-lot-of-stuff">Comes with A LOT of stuff!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this kit for my gopro type camera! I was looking for an accessory kit that had both the body, as well as the head strap, and this kit had that plus more!It came in a nice ziplock plastic bag, plus other little bags in it, so each part of the kit was separated into what you needed to use each attachment. I&rsquo;m not very good at figuring out which mount goes to what, so I found this very helpful.This kit also comes with a cool hand strap and selfie pole type stick! It also comes with all the sticky pads you need to mount it to different things. This does not come with a hard case to put everything in (see pic), but the bag pretty much serves as a good portable storage unit. I also have my own camera bag, so I just can throw the plastic bag, or individual attachments in there - no worries.Overall, this is a great little kit with many options! I recommend! :)</p>

<h5 id="though-which-is-in-surprisingly-good-quality-but-it-s-just-crowded-to-hold-all">though which is in surprisingly good quality, but it&rsquo;s just crowded to hold all &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually I was only looking for a head strap for my 4K action cam but end up with this full accessory kit, wow, it contains everything I need or I might need in the future. A head strap alone would cost $8~$10, but this whole set is just over $20, what a bargain! I do have a small complain about the carrying case, though which is in surprisingly good quality, but it&rsquo;s just crowded to hold all accessories at the same time, a bigger case will be nicer!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-such-a-nice-collection-of-action-camera-accessories">This is such a nice collection of action camera accessories.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it comes in a sturday bag to organize and store them nice and handy.I already own some of action camera tools and this one set has everything that were quite useful for general outdoor activities.Dash cam stand, wrist band, head band, chest band, tripod, selfi stick and floating grip&hellip;etcThey all perfectly fit to my action camera that was purchased on Amazon.I am very pleased with this purchase</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-had-a-gopro-camera-and-i-liked-using-my-gopro-go-hiking-to-film">I had a GoPro camera and I liked using my GoPro go hiking to film</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a GoPro camera and I liked using my GoPro go hiking to film. Sometimes I need some accessories because GoPro needs accesorries to fix it. But in original camera package there is not accessories inside. If I buy original GoPro accessories, that will be too expensive for me to afford. I chose this one because it has most of very valuable accessories inside and I do not need buy them one by one. This brand is much cheaper than others. I like it so much!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-enough-for-me">Good enough for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price this kit is outstanding. It has tons of stuff, quality is ok. For example. The suction mount stayed securely attached to my slalom water ski tip as I cut back and forth. It also stayed attached to a shaking outboard motor during a ski run. Good enough for me. The selfie stick includes attachements for phones as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-could-extend-the-camera-use-to-daily-based-with-the-set">I could extend the camera use to daily based with the set.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The set extends the application of my sports camera. I particularly like the dash board accessory which the camera could be used as a dash board camera. The arm band is also nice for cycling on road. The camera is actually fastened pretty well while in use and I do not really worry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-accessories-it-fits-for-other-action-cameras-too">Excellent accessories. It fits for other action cameras too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent accessories. It fits for other action cameras too. THE Best price for so many accessories as compared to the gro pro brand and even good quality. It got everything, from selfie stick to chest strips, hand strap, head strap and much more. All the action camera buyer should purchase this, you will love it.</p>
