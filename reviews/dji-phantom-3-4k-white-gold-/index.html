<h5 id="so-easy-to-fly-a-child-could-do-it">So easy to fly a child could do it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did soooo much research before purchasing this drone. I knew I wanted a drone for good photo and video, wasn&rsquo;t concerned with distance, and didn&rsquo;t want to break the bank. After tons of research, I was between the Phantom 3 Standard, the Advanced, and the 4K.I had really been convinced I was going to get the Advanced over the Standard. It had the upgraded sensor, had the better controller, and used Light Bridge. After more research, I found that the Phantom 4K was a combination of the Standard and the Professional. It has the 4K camera that I really wanted, but then it comes with the upgraded remote for additional camera features and controls. The way it ends up being cheaper is that it uses WiFi like the Standard, vs Light Bridge like the Advanced and Professional. Since distance wasn&rsquo;t important to me (1 mile is plenty fine, I don&rsquo;t need to have it out 3 miles), the 4K was the logical choice for my needs.Given the statement above, I have found the weakness of WiFi already. I easily loose signal in high WiFi areas or if I lose line of sight. The Light Bridge technology would take care of these issues. However, this has only happened a couple of times and in by no means has it been a deal breaker for me.As far as flight goes, I&rsquo;ve been flying manual, cheaper quads for about two years. They are no doubt challenging and have a major learning curve. I was very nervous about flying the Phantom 3 for the first time. I read the manual, watched multiple training videos, etc. Basically, I didn&rsquo;t want to crash my new $600 piece of equipment. On my very first flight, I couldn&rsquo;t believe how ridiculously easy it is to fly. It takes off by itself, will hover when you let go of the controls, and will land itself (but you probably knew all of that from the research you&rsquo;ve been doing). My 7 year old daughter can fly this, it&rsquo;s really that easy.After playing around with different settings in the app, I finally got the camera and video modes where I want. The picture quality is amazing. I&rsquo;ve purchased additional filters for the camera to enhance the image some and am so pleased with the quality.Overall, I absolutely love this quad and highly recommend it to anyone. My dad ended up getting one, having no flying experience and is also in love. I really can&rsquo;t say enough good things about it.</p>

<h5 id="the-camera-quality-isnt-all-that-great-as-i-thought-it-would-be-when-i-watched">the camera quality isnt all that great as i thought it would be when i watched &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> the reason i gave this a 3 star review is because the wifi does not want to connect sometimes. took the drone with me when i went offroading and the drone did not want to connect most of the time. and when i did connect, i had pick a specific spot so i wouldnt lose connection. so, i could not record when i wanted it too. the camera quality isnt all that great as i thought it would be. when its sunny out, the glare is horrible. video shows a lot of white spots. peoples&rsquo; faces are too bright. i played with all the settings and could not fix the problem. when i would put it on sunny mode, the video would be yellowish. i wish i did not spend that much on this. wouldve bought another drone.</p>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an AWESOME product I use it every day. It came with a 1 year warranty with spare parts. It is excellent I think it is well worth the price. Everything came that I was expecting and even some more stuff that I was not expecting to come in the package. Camera is great films in 4k. For the price I think it more worth it then the Phantom 3 professional .But to worn you this is not the Phantom 3 professional it looks like it but it is not it is the Phantom 3 4k.</p>

<h5 id="great-drone-and-very-fun">Great drone and very fun!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first drone I have purchased. After all the reviews, I was convinced the Phantom 3 4K would be the best fit for me. I have had it for about a month and logged about 4 hours flight time. I agree with several other reviews that state the documentation and instructions are lacking. However, it is sufficient for getting started. The more advanced features and the best settings I have learned from others on YouTube and still learning.</p>

<h5 id="software-is-awesome-the-drone-is-incredibly-stable">Software is awesome, the drone is incredibly stable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such an incredible combination of technologies. Software is awesome, the drone is incredibly stable, and the camera in one of the best I&rsquo;ve ever used. The limited range with the 3 4K does make it feel a little limited at times, but for me 75% of the time I can do everything I want to with it.</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-extra-100-over-the-standard">Worth the extra $100 over the Standard !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The same as the Phantom 3 Standard but with a 4K camera and the better style transmitter. Still works on WiFi like the Standard but worth the extra $100 for the transmitter &amp; camera upgrade.</p>

<h5 id="had-my-baby-in-for-about-a-week-now-loving-it">Had my baby in for about a week now&hellip; LOVING IT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my phantom 3 4K for about a week now and have taken it on around 10 flights. It is the thing I most look forward to doing everyday. I previously owned and operated one other drone. I paid about $100 for my first drone and at most would call it a cool toy. My Phantom 3 4K I would call an amazing tool. I have yet to test most of the various functions modes and anything else extensively but I am exceedingly happy with my purchase. Everything arrived in perfect condition. Nothing was incorrect about my order.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-1">Awesome!</h5>

<p>Tried few of the $100 range drones and it was just a waste of time. If you can afford to go for Phantom 3 (or 4K version as I did) this is like comparing a 20 year old car from a&hellip;</p>
