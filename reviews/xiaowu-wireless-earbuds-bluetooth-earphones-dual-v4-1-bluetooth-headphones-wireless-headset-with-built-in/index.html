<blockquote>
<p>I have wanted a pair to listen to music while working or exercising and these will change everything for you if you are tired of being tethered to a cord. I have had so many frustrating instances of mine getting caught on things and having to carry my phone around. This was a wonderful choice for me.This comes with 2 earbuds, a charging station, and a USB-to-charging station cord (you plug it into a computer/laptop) or wall charger that is USB compatible.[I have a Samsung Galaxy 6edge smart phone][The pair I bought were &ldquo;Black-K2&rdquo;, those in image 2]I have included images to explain how this worked for me.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Instructions&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;= A Green light on the charger means it is ready to charge your earbuds; Red light means it needs to be plugged in.= A Red light on your ear buds means they need to be charged or you have turned them off; Alternating Red/Blue means they are powered on1. Turn on the switch on your charger2. Place your earbuds in the charger and wait until they go from Red to Blue (charged)3. Take BOTH off the charger4. I recommend you go ahead and begin to play music or some audio on your phone or device so you know when this is successful5. Find the Apps/Menu Icon6. Go to the &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; (Gear symbol) on your phone7. Find the Bluetooth symbol ( or the setting that says Bluetooth)8. Take BOTH of your earbuds and press down on the button on top (keep your thumbs on the lower end so you can see the light)9. BOTH will begin to flash in alternating Blue and Red. This means they are powering on.10. If you don&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;TWS-K2&rdquo; coming up on your Bluetooth list then see if you can find &lsquo;Scan&rsquo; or &lsquo;Search&rsquo;. It should attempt to connect.11. Place the ear buds in your ears. You should hear the following: Several beeps from both, a voice announcing the word &ldquo;Connected&rdquo;. This will be followed by a voice in one ear bud announcing &ldquo;Left Channel&rdquo; and the other will announce &ldquo;Right Channel&rdquo;. One of the two will then say &ldquo;Second Device Connected&rdquo;. Several seconds later, audio should begin to play through both.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Pros- Your earbud/headset cord not getting caught on everything- Not having to carry your device around the room with you- Price is superior to other sites- These are reliable- Light weight- Excellent battery- The charger seems to have a magnetic pull that tries to get the earbuds in without you- Impressive sound quality- The charger doesn&rsquo;t need to be connected to an outlet always- Turning them off and on is straight forward- Putting them on the changer disconnects them- Secure fitCons- My phone&rsquo;s volume doesn&rsquo;t go low enough and these are impressively loud (though I would say this is more of a flaw with the phone itself)- The fit takes some getting used to- I do have to charge them once a day after several hours of use- The instructions are in very tiny print even for someone with good eyesightIn conclusion, I would completely recommend these. 100% one of my favorite purchases.I think these are all around a wonderful buy.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-and-sound-quality-is-really-good">Wonderful and sound quality is really good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these yesterday. First off I will say, 1 earphone gave me trouble connecting and I have owned similiar product, so I am familiar with how to pair them together and with a phone. First, let it be known how MUCH I appreciate that the voice that informs you that pairing, paired, low battery, etc, is not so loud that in middle of a song or audiobook a loud low battery actual makes you jump like someone screamed &ldquo;BOO&rdquo; at you. Yes, I am that person who was listening to an audiobook to fall asleep and then actually asleep was woke up scared with this LOW BATTERY in my ears&hellip; I almost came off the bed. So, that is not a problem with this brand. However&hellip; Now I am treated to channel 1 or channel 2 being said when pairing as well as second device connected. I found that when I turned on one and connected it to the phone, I have to wait for it to pair, then turned on second one and paired it with earpiece then had to manually scan to the phone as well, it did not do it automatically, like my previous brand. On my Samsung s5 it went smooth, and I have a note 4 as well and the first time it saw it on the scan but said cannot pair with tws-k2 but I tried again and it worked. Anyway it is only first day, I will update with any other issues. Also I saw lot of complaints they could not understand rhe prompts, mine is all in Engish, but I do know that you can gain access to another language, I assume it is Chinese, by a series of presses you have to do, so maybe when trying to pair you accidentally did the sub menu for languages&hellip;play around with pressing the button as you start each earpieceUPDATEI also love the fact that you can charge one earpiece at a time and i also now have an s7 and it worls great with the earpieces</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-pair-with-my-iphone-6s">Easy to pair with my iPhone 6s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to pair with my iPhone 6s, they connect separately and you will hear an alert saying left channel or right channel. You can wear these two separate ways, either in the ear by themselves or with the ear hooks. I tend to favor ear hooks in general so I&rsquo;ve been using them on.The sound is pretty good, I haven&rsquo;t had any complaints when on a phone call and music is nice and clear sounding. You do have to control the volume from your phone because these don&rsquo;t have volume buttons.Charging them is easy just place them in back in the charging case but you have to take the ear hooks off to do that. The only thing that would have made that better is some sort of lid or cover for the charging case so that they don&rsquo;t fall out when I put them in my backpack or book bag.Also, nowhere that I found is the L/R ear branding so when I turn them on, sometimes I have to change ears depending on what headphone is where.</p>

<h5 id="grear-for-workout">Grear for workout!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Bluetooth headphones are great for working out. The sound is clear and bold and it’s easy to pair. I have an iPhone 7p and it works like a charm. I like the fact that it has its own little charging station and different earbuds to enhance the fit. The ear piece that goes around your ear is very comfortable and stays in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handy-backup-set">Handy backup set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great clear sound, callers can hear me too, and comfortable over the ear holders. However you have to take the holders on and off in order to charge ear buds. Also, I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I liked the convenience of charging ear buds directly instead of using a separate charge bed like this set. I bought these since my LG behind the neck wireless gave out within a year of use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-running-dead-in-less-than-20-mins">Battery running dead in less than 20 mins</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Claimed lasting 2+ Hours, but the first several times I found the battery run out in less than 20 mins. I thought I didn&rsquo;t fully charge or some sort of things, but it just keeps doing so even after I carefully read the guide again and do accordingly. I initiated the return, then realized it&rsquo;s overdue. I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy at work, so very little time to pay attention to such things, or write a review. No that piece of junk&rsquo;s just lying somewhere in my house, and I&rsquo;m writing my first Amazon review while considering if the law can really protect consumers being lied about important product feature and wasting money and time on such dishonest business.</p>

<p>In general the price matches the quality and works ok, but-The blutooth connection disconnects from time to time even when the phone is in my pocket, a little bit of a down,&hellip;</p>
