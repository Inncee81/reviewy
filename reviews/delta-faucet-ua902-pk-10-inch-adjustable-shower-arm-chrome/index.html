<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Put two of them together for a real rain shower experience. I had one of the extenders and the rain head for almost two years but the other day thought to buy another extender to give me more height. Im 6ft and have more than 6 inches of clearance. FYI, the two extenders are the same brand. I went with the same because the first one lasted so long with no issues. Also, I move frequently so it has been installed and uninstalled 6 times in two years. No leaks, no problems.</p>

<h5 id="low-cost-fix-in-case-of-any-problems">Low cost fix in case of any problems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I knew that I was flirting with danger when I ordered this item, but I like to live on the wild-side. Nothing ventured, nothing gained is my motto. And since I am an ex Silicon Valley engineer, now living in Oregon, I knew I could make it work.I sifted through comments carefully, noting that there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any about the mounting of a Moen &ldquo;Halo&rdquo; to this device. But it also sounded as if this piece-of-work was holding up quite a substantial amount of weight. I figured it might have a locking-type mechanism instead of the normal round type that always slips. Big mistake on my part.Did I mention I was an engineer? I got it to work in no time flat and it is a very practical solution. As a bonus, my fix is an easy to accomplish, and low-cost modification. Please refer to the picture I posted in case you, or anyone else would like to apply this same alteration. It can be applied to any device of this type, including all adjustable desk lamps and other similar units you may be having problems with. Best wishes&hellip;KathyPicture: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0064TYE9Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_txt">http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0064TYE9Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_txt</a></p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-shower-arm-you-don-t-need-to-put-that-much-thought-into-this-purchase-i-promise">It&rsquo;s a shower arm, you don&rsquo;t need to put that much thought into this purchase, I promise.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PROS:-Solid construction-Easy to adjustCONS:-Shorter than you&rsquo;d think, but nowhere near a deal breakerI got this as an extension for the AKDY 8&rdquo; rain shower head, it does exactly what it needs to, it&rsquo;s like Inspector Gadget, except only the extendo-arm. I was actually surprised because I was honestly expecting half of it to be plastic, but it was entirely metal, which afirmed my beliefs that I will never have a problem with this thing. The screws tighten nicely, you can put it at whatever position you want easily, not much else to say. Only real downside is that ten inches(probably more likely 9 the way most people have it set up) is really less than you&rsquo;d think. I&rsquo;m considering getting a 12&rdquo;-14&rdquo; arm to replace this one day. Until then, it does the job well.[04-30-16] EDIT: Still using this same shower arm with the same rain shower head. It still works decent, but if I move the shower head too much, it&rsquo;s pretty much guaranteed to lose its tightened hold. I don&rsquo;t really ever move the shower head though, so it isn&rsquo;t a real problem, just something to take into account when guying this. Still feels solid when I do tighten it though, I don&rsquo;t expect the fasteners to break any time soon.</p>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, it allows me to get the water in the best position for me and all the users with out having to turn the actual shower head, I love it and I am now outfitting the other shower with the same product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At 6&rsquo;1&rdquo; and my wife 5&rsquo;2&rdquo; our shower needs are quite different. This shower arm solves everything. We have a rain head with a shower handle. The head came off ,attached the new shower arm then reattached the head. Works great. And the separate shower handle was uneffected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-not-a-12-inch-extension-and-restricts-flow">This is not a 12 inch extension and restricts flow&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave it 3 stars because technically it works and it&rsquo;s cheap. You should know that this is not a 12&rdquo; extension. It is a 9&rdquo; extension, which is the same length as the Danze D481150 9-Inch Adjustable Shower Arm with High Flow, Chrome which has a larger diameter feed tube (for higher flow) with adjusters that are more sturdy and will work better with heavier shower heads such as the Moen S6320 Velocity Two-Function 8-Inch Diameter Rainshower Showerhead, Chrome which we also purchased here on Amazon.To sum up, the diameter of the tubing used in this product does not match the diameter of the Shower Arm coming out of the wall. It&rsquo;s much narrower and could restrict water flow, which is not something you want if you are using a Rain Shower type shower head. It&rsquo;s also very thin wall construction and flexed quite a bit during installation. It felt to me as though any really hard cranking on it with a wrench would probably bend it. The Danze I linked to above has the same diameter Tubing as our shower arm, so it matches better and in my opinion, is a higher quality product.</p>

<h5 id="easy-install-works-like-a-charm">Easy Install, Works Like A Charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second time I&rsquo;ve purchased this adjustable shower arm and I does everything I need it to do. I initially order this device because the water pipe coming into the bathroom shower (in my rental unit) was way too low for me (I had to crouch to get under the water) - so this gave the needed extension I was looking for. Installation was very simple, including the use of the sealant tape that comes with the product. I&rsquo;ve owned and used the first one I purchased for about two years (the second one was a gift), and I&rsquo;ve had ZERO issues with leaks or the screw tighteners at the joints. Two years after installation, it&rsquo;s in the same position as I&rsquo;ve originally installed it. I will add though that I don&rsquo;t use a heavy shower head (one of those plum-sized screw-in heads with no hose/attachments). So read other reviews if you&rsquo;re using something heavy.PROS:- Easy to install- No leaks / no weak joint screws (with a light shower head)- Easy to adjust positionCONS:- might not be able to handle very heavy shower heads* photo shows the product. I was able to gain 8 additional inches of vertical compared to my original faucet installed unusually low. Now I don&rsquo;t have to crouch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-not-recommend-this-for-a-8">i would not recommend this for a 8</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this works for what it is intended to do, but i bought it in conjunction with a 8&rdquo; rain shower head. as you can see in the pictures it&rsquo;s quite SHORT when it&rsquo;s in use. this does work but barely. i would not recommend this for a 8, 10, or 12&rdquo; rain shower head overall though. no leaks and the product does what it says it does. the customizable tils on each side is great as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nope-nope-nope">Nope nope nope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve screwed these on over 15 times and no matter where I start the threads once tight it&rsquo;s not in the position I need it to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-both-me-and-my-wife">Works for both me and my wife.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice for my new shower. Now both me and my much shorter wife and use it with no strain. Easy to install - right price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-like-a-brand-new-shower">it like a brand new shower</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never written a review for a product before, but I felt compelled to share one for this product. It is fabulous!</p>

<p>My bathroom in my apartment isn&rsquo;t fit for a person above 5&rsquo;4&rdquo;. This was a lifesaver being that I&rsquo;m over 6 foot tall.</p>

<p>Perfect replacement. Saved me some bucks cause the Delta shower head is still good after 7 years. And I plan to get another 7 years out of it.</p>
