<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="far-better-than-i-thought">Far better than i thought !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a smoker and needed an exhaust window fan. This fan really does the job. My house usually smells of smoke but now, this fan clears the house within about 2 hours. Up close the fan produces about 50 db of noise however, where i sit in the house the noise level is only about 35 db. I am very pleased with this purchase. Will buy again when needed.</p>

<h5 id="reversible-electric-window-fan-works-well-intake-and-exhaust-does-the-job">Reversible electric window fan, works well, intake and exhaust, does the job!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for a bedroom window after our heat pump went out and we can&rsquo;t get anyone out to the boonies to fix it so have no air conditioning. This fit perfectly, comes with little legs you can use to just set it on the floor or where ever you want. It only has high or low for settings which is perfect for us as by morning the air gets pretty cold from outside and the window where we put this is right above our head. It is doing a good job bringing in cool air on high during the day and at night we either set it on low or just off since the air can come in any way. It has both intake for cool air and exhaust for getting stale air out and you can set one side for intake and the other for exhaust if you want. Just make sure to shut both fan off before you change the switch to help on wear and tear of the motor on each fan. It does have a button to adjust the comfort levels. The side slider things are a little hard to get adjusted where you want them and to keep them that way or were for me any way. If you need a good window twin blade fan to help keep you cool I recommend this one.</p>

<h5 id="one-motor-failed-right-away-and-overall-poor-design">One motor failed right away and overall poor design.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This one supposed to be replacing a Duracraft made by Honeywell, which I bought in 2001 second hand from a friend for $20. Yes, 15 years old fan was still kicking when I bought Lasko! I used Duracraft to exhaust a cigarette smoke from my computer room. So all I had to do to maintain it, is to lubricate motors with WD-40 once in a while. Couple of month ago one motor totally failed (and I do not blame it - it served me well all those years - rain/snow/heat - it has seen it all).So back to Lasko. Right fan would not work on exhaust out of the box. It worked on intake, but starts slow (looks like an unbalanced assembly). I have read many reviews here about how powerful motors are. Well, they are NOT! I do not know what the power of motors was compared to.Now, I have my 15 years old Duracraft with 1 working fan and Brand new Lasko with 1 fan working on exhaust - side by side. My old fan beats the hell of Lasko. Sure, Lasko is much more quiet. But is does not do the job. I think it is a design flaw. A small blades diameter and whole lot of open space around it, compare to my old fan, where blades are larger and sit closer to edges and sides. So it does suck air out much more efficient.I would have returned Lasko, even if it was in perfect working condition. I just need something that really does the job exhausting a smoke out&hellip; or just quit smoking (but that is another story).</p>

<h5 id="still-going-strong-after-more-than-seven-years">Still going strong after more than seven years!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve run this fan for 10 hours per day for more than seven years and it&rsquo;s still going strong. I just ordered a 2nd fan since I know this one can&rsquo;t possibly last forever and I don&rsquo;t want to risk not being able to find this same model again.For a year or two, I had it mounted in my bedroom window. Since my window wasn&rsquo;t the sash type, I placed the fan on its side and used several strips of earthquake putty to help ensure a solid fit. It was perfect! I also plugged it into a timer so it turned on and off automatically. When we moved to another house, I couldn&rsquo;t mount it in the window because our security system wouldn&rsquo;t arm with windows open so I leaned it against the wall and used the same timer to turn it on and off. And that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s remained for the last five years!The best thing about this fan is the lovely &ldquo;white noise&rdquo; it emits. It masks the sound of cats and cars and furnace noises so I don&rsquo;t wake up constantly throughout the night. Seven years is more than 2500 nights of blissful sleep!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hot-and-broke">Hot and broke!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WINDOW FAN!! What you&rsquo;re paying for is a headache and the need to head to the nearest bar! I&rsquo;m a 60 year old disabled woman. I&rsquo;ve always been able to at least put things together. This is cheaply made and terrible to work with. The side panels do not stretch to 35&rdquo;. They don&rsquo;t even stay in place once you stretch them, then attempt to use the cheapest screws that are stripped when you turn them to supposedly keep the side panels in place. Feeling completely disappointed and that my money was wasted. There&rsquo;s an $11 charge to ship this hunk of junk back. Insane!!!</p>

<h5 id="are-too-hard-to-use-for-seniors-and-really-bad-if-you-have-cts-box-and-website-description">&hellip; are too hard to use for seniors and really bad if you have CTS &mdash; box and website description &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>plastic extenders are too hard to use for seniors and really bad if you have CTS &mdash; box and website description does not tell you that the side that faces the screen is as deep/big/whatever(?) as the side that faces inside the house &mdash; will not fit inside window &mdash;&mdash; I have two other fans and both have the back side smaller than the inside so that it will not crush and/or bust the screen</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-and-quite-too">Nice and quite too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello, We are enjoying our fan. It&rsquo;s being used in the kitchen window, that helps circulate air when cooking. Nice and quite too!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-lasko-window-fans">I love Lasko window fans! :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the years I have found Lasko to be the ONLY twin window fan manufacturer that understands window fans should fit flush in a window! I have be purchasing Lasko window fans for over 20 years and always satisfied with my purchases.The top design of the fan is flat and fits any window. There are two accordion side extenders that are even in size and extend more graciously than any other brand.I&rsquo;ve purchased larger and more expensive brands that wound up being returned immediately because of idiotic designs that do not allow the windows to close properly around the fan (i.e.: curves at the top of the design and only one accordion side extender.)If you want a simple design that actually fits all types of windows and like having your fan(s) centered, stick with Lasko. They know how to design window fans properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE this window fan! It never loses its strength and the exhaust feature is so wonderful at temperature control!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works pretty well, wish air flow was bit better. Works in slide window however need to secure it yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fan-works-fine-as-listed">Fan works fine, as listed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fan works fine, as listed. Problem is wings that are on either side to adjust fan to window do not work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-with-issue">Good product with issue.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work great in my shop to move air out. Easy to use.However, that is after I had to take it apart and use a hair dryer to heat up the side flaps to stretch them out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sweet-fan">Sweet Fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well! Quiet enough for me to sleep at nights with it running. Moves a nice amount of air and keeps it circulating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So much plastic it wouldn&rsquo;t stretch out. definitely cheaply made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reasonably-quiet">Reasonably quiet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised. It&rsquo;s also reasonably quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-more-cat-litter-smell-this-does-what-is-says">No more cat litter smell - this does what is says!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Use this fan in my window in the bedroom. I turn in on reverse and it draws all the air from my room and sends it outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-fan-hubs-were-cracked-and-blades-hit-housing-upon">The fan hubs were cracked and blades hit housing upon &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The fan hubs were cracked and blades hit housing upon arrival.ordered replacement, and the same with the second one. Returned both for a refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Junk, just buy a box fan if you can they&rsquo;re way cheaper and twice as powerful as this thing.</p>
