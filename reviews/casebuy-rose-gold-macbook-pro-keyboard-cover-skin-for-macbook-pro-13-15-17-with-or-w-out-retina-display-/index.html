<h5 id="nice-cover-fits-very-well">NICE cover Fits very well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received the TPU cover today from Amazon. First impressions - I really like it. Very thin and fit is perfect. Lays very nicely down on the keyboard and does not move at all even when I type quite firmly. Feel is also good - not tacky at all like silicon (which I don&rsquo;t like) kind of smooth. Good Buy, the only reason I have docked one star is because it is not 100% transparent. Very very slightly opaque or frost type of finish. I think maybe thats the way TPU is and it really doesn&rsquo;t bother me too much.Pictures attached. I have also included pic without the keyboard so you can compare the difference with and without.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-doesn-t-even-look-like-there-s-something-extra-on-there-and-the-only-difference">it doesn&rsquo;t even look like there&rsquo;s something extra on there and the only difference &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the keys on my Macbook had started to wear off, leaving ugly white splotches where letters used to be (for some reason, it appears the black part is what wears off rather than the letters themselves rubbing off the black keys). I wanted to find a skin that could cover and protect the keys, but also maintain the original look of the keyboard. This one fit the bill perfectly.Depending on the lighting, it doesn&rsquo;t even look like there&rsquo;s something extra on there and the only difference felt when typing is the softer texture of the keys. I also haven&rsquo;t noticed any movement in the skin while typing on it, but the edges do lift up if you happen to brush against the corners or edges of the skin. There is nothing that holds it in place other than how it shapes itself to the keys and fits into the depression that holds the keyboard. The backlight shows perfectly through the skin as well.The main negative I have noticed is how easily the rubbery texture attracts dust, lint, hair, and any other small particle that might come into contact with it. There doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any decent way to clean them off and keep the keys looking sleek and black, but I suppose I should just be happy this stuff is no longer getting stuck between or under the actual keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-and-works-well-but-not-perfect">Cheap and works well, but not perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay first off I ordered the hollow black one that looks black with pink accents. It is not pink, it&rsquo;s white&hellip; so inaccurate description/pictures- but I really like the feel of it and I don&rsquo;t mind the white so I am keeping it. It does not align perfectly with the keyboard, so if you are super irritated by little details this is not the one for you (maybe try clear so you can see the letters/keys more precisely). I don&rsquo;t really care about that, and it&rsquo;s super cheap, not made by apple so you can&rsquo;t expect it to be perfect in my opinion. I went ahead and ordered the clear one as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="totally-solid">totally solid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing gets cloudy, but it truly doesn&rsquo;t warp, and I can see the backlighting clearly (which I just don&rsquo;t find with the products with cutouts). I&rsquo;ve had this on my computer for months and months, and it shows barely any signs of wear. All keyboard covers will change the feel of the keyboard, but this one is a bit more minimal than a silicone one. I personally need the extra cushion because my keys act funny at times (and covers seem to help), and also I find the low-profile of the keyboard too difficult to type on. With the adhesive, this won&rsquo;t fall off. The only star I took off is for the clouding.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-expected">Better Than Expected!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Macbook Pro 2016 with no touch bar (model number A1708). I was afraid the the keyboard cover would be either too thick, or that it won&rsquo;t fit, but it fits great! It&rsquo;s nice and snug! The keyboard cover is surprisingly thin. I was really shocked. It doesn&rsquo;t takeaway from much of that natural keyboard feel. I only noticed a very very minuscule difference. No more worries about greasy keys. Great product! Would highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-and-lays-flat">Pretty and lays flat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just the rose gold keyboard cover today for my MacBook pro retina display 13&rdquo;. I got it to compliment a new rose gold cover. It&rsquo;s very pretty and I like the contrasting white keys on the outer edges. The letters on the keyboard cover are transparent so that the letters from the actual keyboard shows through. The only issue is that the letters and numbers line up well with the keyboard cover but just about all the symbols above the numbers and the words on the keys in white do not line up exactly. Other than that, it fits the keyboard fine and lays flat without warping (so far).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality">Excellent quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I searched around for many keyboard covers but I&rsquo;m highly pleased with choosing this one. The material surpassingly doesn&rsquo;t hinder the typing experience that much. It fits snugly on the keys. The TPU doesn&rsquo;t stick to your fingers and it doesn&rsquo;t lift up at all while you&rsquo;re typing. Corners haven&rsquo;t decided to roll up. All transparent keyboard covers are going to have that frosted effect but I honestly don&rsquo;t mind the look. Overall, I&rsquo;d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive any quality cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unstuck-sad">Unstuck &amp; Sad!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product fit like a glove on my beautiful new MacBook! Sadly, it began to peel off after 20 days. I would love to have a replacement!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice one. I just thought that it would stick to the keyboard. it never did and maybe all of them are like that .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-but">Okay, but&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its a really nice cover and fits wells, but it doesn&rsquo;t line up exactly in some ways.</p>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<p>The shortcuts are useful but typing on the cover really slows me down.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-fits-perfectly-on-the-keys-in-the-middle">It fits perfectly on the keys in the middle, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits perfectly on the keys in the middle, but as you go further and further out, it&rsquo;s too big and does not line up with the keys correctly where the cutouts for the lights.</p>
