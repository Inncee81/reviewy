</ul>

<p>The Mares Cruise Backpack Mesh Deluxe is your all-in-one dive travel bag. This bag can be packed for travel and then taken directly to the dive site, whether from the beach or boat. Durable PVC, nylon, and polyester construction ensure durability and longevity. The PVC net allows for water drainage from the dive site and an easy access lateral zipper means that you can easily access anything in your bag. Additionally, there is a drawstring top for access. An additional padded outer pocket is great for regulator and computer storage. The backpack straps are padded and adjustable for the perfect fit. Plus, two rubber handles allow for additional carriage as a duffel bag for quick transportation. A great feature with the deluxe mesh bag is that it is not entirely mesh, so when carrying wet gear, you have a barrier to keep you dry. The Mares Deluxe Mesh Backpack is a versatile and durable dive bag that every traveler should own.</p>

<h5 id="durable-well-made-and-attractive-bag-at-an-unbelievable-price">Durable, well made, and attractive bag at an unbelievable price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife bought this for me after my old Scuba Toys dive bag was converted into the family beach bag. At first I was mad that I had lost my bag - now I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.This bag is amazing. It beats my old bag (same price) in every aspect. The materials and build quality are what I would expect from a bag costing twice as much. The entire bag is solid and even the mesh is thick and durable. It&rsquo;s a massive bag and the oversized pocket is great for masks and save-a-dive kits. I fit my wet suit, BC, regulator, fins, and all of my other diving gear (except tanks) into it. Having this bag makes toting around SCUBA gear super easy.I truly couldn&rsquo;t be happier with this bag. It looks nice, it holds all my gear, and for the quality you get it&rsquo;s an absolute steal. It seems to be built for the long haul and it survived it&rsquo;s first diving season unscathed. It&rsquo;s so nice to board a dive charter carrying only 1 bag.You really can&rsquo;t go wrong here - it also doubles as a great beach bag - it holds several chairs and umbrellas with ease and the mesh makes it easy to shake the sand out at the end of the day.Perhaps the most positively surprising thing I have received from Amazon.Edit: I wanted to add the photo so you can see the fins next to the bag for scale. For some reason, Amazon keeps flipping the photo on its side. I have tried uploading it right side-up, up side-down, and sideways and the pic never on Amazon never changes. Go figure.</p>

<h5 id="comfortable-way-to-carry-a-lot-of-gear">Comfortable way to carry a lot of gear!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for a recent scuba/snorkeling trip, along with another Mares Cruise Duffle (which I am returning as we didn&rsquo;t use it). This was far superior to the duffle. The mesh is the rubbery mesh which tends to be more durable than the fabric only mesh. Additionally, it holds a TON! We could easily put the following in the bag:Inside the big mesh section, which has a nice long zipper so you can load either from the side or from the top:-2 sets of fins-2 sets of boots (both with harder bottoms, so they&rsquo;re a little bigger)-2 BDCs-2 regulators-PLENTY of space for additional stuff, like towels, clothes, etc.Inside the inner zipper pocket (zips at the top and is really long (the entire length of the bag):-2 snorkels (I liked this pocket so the snorkels stayed somewhat protected from all the other big gearInside the outer pouch:-2 pairs of goggles in their plastic casesAfter previously carrying one set of gear in a duffle and carrying 2 sets in this, the backpack style is SO MUCH more comfortable to carry! You don&rsquo;t even really notice it&rsquo;s on your back. I love this bag! It would be great for the beach or any other activity that you want the ability for the contents to air out. There are drain holes on the bottom of the main compartment as well as on the bottom of the outside pouch. It also rolls up to a fairly compact size. My only wish is that there were an additional smaller pocket to put keys or a wallet. If the goggles weren&rsquo;t in the boxes, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to put my keys in the same pouch to avoid scratching the goggles, so it would be nice to have a place to put a few other small things, but this is definitely not a deal breaker for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-bag">Nice Bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Please keep in mind that I am a newly certified diver and my experience is therefore limited. Having said that, I really like this bag. I keep small stuff (defogger, extra clips, etc) in the front pouch. Dive logs (during class, books and other materials) in the waterproof rear compartment. It&rsquo;s got plenty of room for my fins, mask, snorkel, booties, regulator assembly, wetsuit, clothes and a towel. You can carry it upright by a handle on the top, sideways by a handle on the side, and as a backpack. I find it to be comfortable as far as backpacks go. There is a zipper on the side of the bag that runs the whole length (top to bottom) if you want to use that instead of the pull-string on top to access contents.The bag is very sturdy and the mesh has some kind of rubber coating. I did spray it down with silicone and also treated the zipper with wax. I&rsquo;m hoping the bag will last for years, but so far - no complaints at all.</p>

<h5 id="very-impressed">Very Impressed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this within 1 day of ordering using super saver free shipping. The price was cheaper on Amazon than elsewhere.Now for the product - i was concerned it would be cheap quality based on a couple of reviews. The picture does NOT do this bag justice. The bag is LARGE. I was concerned I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fit my gear and my wife&rsquo;s into this bag and that we may need 2. In fact I can fit my huge fins, boots, towels, snorkels, masks and log book among a few personal items. Impressed w/ the size and perfect for a couple or just me personally (i like having space). It also can condense down when empty.There is a rubber coating on the mesh which makes it seem durable and water friendly. The zippers are heavy duty and so are the straps and handles. I have not field tested this but wrote the review so quick b/c of how impressed I was after receiving something i thought i may have to return. In fact, this is the keeper and i will return the other bags i bought to check out.Great product!</p>

<h5 id="not-as-advertised-outside-pocket-not-padded-will-not-protect-regulator-or-dive-computer">Not as advertised! Outside pocket not padded, will not protect regulator or dive computer. :(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so disappointed to receive this bag and see that the outside pocket is not padded!!!! The advertisement says that it&rsquo;s padded to protect your regulator and computer, but it&rsquo;s not even a little padded. It&rsquo;s a single sheet of nylon. I was really looking forward to having a padded regulator pocket on the outside of my dive bag&hellip; and the reviews were all so good, I was surprised this wasn&rsquo;t mentioned by anyone. I double checked the tag to see if I was sent the wrong product - it&rsquo;s not. Even the nice embroidery on the pocket reads &ldquo;Cruise Mesh Deluxe.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="great-bag-that-easily-holds-all-my-gear">Great Bag that easily holds all my gear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Bag that easily holds all my gear. The shoulder straps are comfortable and easily adjustable. I would give it 5 stars but the draw string closure at the top comes loose when you pick up the bag because the friction stop on the sting is too flimsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-backpack">Super Backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First my fins, towel, mask, snorkel and more. It lets everything dry and is strong enough to carry the weight of the wet equipment.</p>

<h5 id="great-bag">great bag</h5>

<h5 id="good-diving-bag">Good diving bag</h5>

<p>good size. all my diving gear in one place. Stronger than what it looks like in the picture</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-hopes-kinda-suffered">High hopes kinda suffered</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Enthusiasm waned because no matter how you load it, when you go to put in on back-pack style, the string-closed top opening opens up. The outside smaller bag is nice in principle.</p>
