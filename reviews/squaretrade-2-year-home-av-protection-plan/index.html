<h5 id="coverage-is-a-sham-in-my-opinion">Coverage is a Sham in my Opinion</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Called today for warranty coverage and got no support&hellip;Jack (alias for a foreign call center employee) told me if the product fails within a year they don&rsquo;t do anything. Told me to contact the OEM and pursue remedy with them. See below: and notice they don&rsquo;t name the product that they know had a 1 year warranty..As per our subsequent conversation, please be informed that every item is covered by its manufacturer for any mechanical or electrical failure from the date of purchase till one year. SquareTrade, being an extended warranty covers the item only if the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty either expires or the manufacturer denies to cover the item.For this we require the reference number from the manufacturer for the denial of the claim, date and time of the call in order to provide an alternate resolution.RegardsJackSquareTrade Claims Specialist</p>

<h5 id="poor-response-on-product-claim">Poor response on product claim</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased two Swivel Portable DVD players in April with the Square Trade 2-year home AV protection plan for each of them. The ear phones on one of the DVD players went out within 3-weeks. We submitted a claim to Square Trade in May and have still not had the problem rectified. We get the run-around each time we communicate with them. We mentioned that we would need to give them a less-than-sterling review. They said &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-should-have-known-this-was-just-a-scam">I should have known this was just a scam. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should have known this was just a scam. I bought this plan to avoid all the hassle and bureaucracy of the manufacturer but of course this two-year plan actually begins after the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty has expired. What&rsquo;s the use of buying a two-year, or even a one-year plan, if Square Trade tells me I have to contact the manufacturer about any problems while its warranty is still valid? That means I pay for a two-year plan that is only honored for one year. Never again will I buy such an obvious ruse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lie-if-you-want-to-collect">Lie if you want to collect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Waste of money. Unless you want to lie about why your item no longer works. If the reason you&rsquo;re making a claim IS covered under the manufactures warranty, Square Trade will tell you that you need to deal with them, not Square Trade. If I had lied and said that it was lost, stolen, damaged from abuse or some other &ldquo;not covered by manufacturer warranty&rdquo; reason, it would have been interesting to see how the Square Trade claims process would have turned out. I found out the same thing on cell phone warranties with Verizon. Should have learned my lesson then but I refuse to lie in order to get reimbursed for a piece of electronics that died after just a couple of months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-warranty-until-after-you-receive-the-item">DO NOT BUY WARRANTY UNTIL AFTER YOU RECEIVE THE ITEM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Normally square trade warranties are an excellent value. However DO NOT BUY THEM FROM AMAZON when you buy the item. This 2 year warranty started on the day I ordered a Fire Stick which I did not get until almost 2 months later. In essence it is a 1 year and 10 month warranty. Next time I will buy the warranty AFTER I actually receive the item.</p>

<h5 id="still-not-a-bad-deal-but-over-8-of-the-purchase-price">Still not a bad deal, but over 8% of the purchase price &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased a DVD player for my daughter for Christmas. The plan was originally offered at 2.15.When I accepted it, it entered my cart at over $3. I deleted the purchase and tried again several times. The price changed each time I put it in my cart. I left it in my cart and continued to shop. Over the course of about 30 minutes the price went up and down about 6 or 7 times that I noticed. I finally accepted it at $4.11. Still not a bad deal, but over 8% of the purchase price instead of 4.3% it was originally. I purchased it on <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>29</sub>. Coverage started <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, even though the DVD player won&rsquo;t be unboxed until <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>. I contacted Square Trade and they were kind and polite, but not able to help me any. They said the price issue was Amazon&rsquo;s fault. But if they had the time, they would look into it. And the coverage date was my fault because I did not indicate it was a gift at the time of purchase. I understood their position and didn&rsquo;t put up a fuss. I did know and agree to the price when I checked out and should have known the warranty would start on the purchase date. But it would have been so much easier, not very costly, and left me a much happier customer with much more respect for the company if they had honored the original $2.15 price and/or agreed to extend the warranty coverage 20 days.</p>

<h5 id="dont-buy-from-them-they-will-rip-you-off">DONT BUY FROM THEM THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was supposed to get my plan by December 5th. I never got it and they wont return my emails. I have contacted amazon and they contacted the seller with no response. this is ridiculous. don&rsquo;t buy it. it might be cheap but if they are just taking your money and ignoring you its not worth it. WORST PURCHASE I EVER MADE!!!!</p>

<h5 id="use-caution-with-square-trade">Use Caution with Square Trade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I had to file a claim. This entire process has been a nightmare. I contacted Square Trade which prompted me complete the form and send all documentation, which I did. Then Square Trade said they couldn&rsquo;t process the claim because it was still under the manufacturers warranty, and to contact the manufacturer. I immediately contacted the manufacturer which stated it was out of warranty - the warranty was for 90days and it was 5 months since the purchase date. I then contacted Square Trade again and the representative with whom I spoke with said they needed documentation from the manufacturer that their warranty was 90days from date of purchase &amp; it was out of warranty. He said once I had the manufacturer&rsquo;s documentation to send it to Square Trade with (xxxxxxxxxx) in the subject line. I again contacted the manufacturer to send me documentation as to their warranty policy and my item was out of warranty. I received the documentation from the manufacturer and sent it to Square Trade with the (xxxxxxxxxx) in the subject line. When I didn&rsquo;t hear from Square Trade, I again called them. I spoke with another representative who wanted everything I had already sent. She put me on hold a couple of times and finally told me it would take at least 48hrs for their system to update and to call them in a few days. So here we are, not knowing much more than I did several hrs ago. I would caution using Square Trade&rsquo;s Protection Plan. You have to jump through hoops for them to honor their protection plan.</p>
