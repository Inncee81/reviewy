<h5 id="this-fan-puts-out-a-good-amount-of-air-movement-and-the-radio-has-decent">This fan puts out a good amount of air movement and the radio has decent &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan puts out a good amount of air movement and the radio has decent sound/volume. It&rsquo;s lightweight and seems sturdy. I purchased this to run in a bathroom w/out a fan and without good access to a plug, and it does the job&hellip;.when it&rsquo;s juiced. We run it on high with the radio, and probably only get 1.5-2 hours out of it and this seems to be running down the more we run it so not sure about the longevity of the battery. I think it&rsquo;s a bit expensive for how long it runs, but doesn&rsquo;t seem less than what is say it can do (up to 4 hours on low with no batter)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-living-abroad">Great for Living Abroad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m studying abroad in Haiti and I do not have electricity throughout the day. I&rsquo;ve traveled to Haiti previously so I knew I had to get some type of rechargeable fan. I found this on Amazon to bring with me. When the electricity goes out, my fan is still running. On low setting, the fan runs for about 5 hours. On high, it&rsquo;s about 2-3, I think. The radio is a plus - the sound quality is great and the speakers are impressive. I would recommend ANYONE going abroad to buy this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-nice-fan-for-tailgating">A nice fan for tailgating.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It gets hot in Florida. Tailgating for a 3:30 football game is not always so pleasant. This fan does what it needs to do and the radio works pretty well also. I decided to buy the old version after reading some reviews and it seems like I made the right choice. We received it on a Friday and the next day we put it to the test. The battery lasted about 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours on high and the radio didn&rsquo;t come in as clear as I thought it would. It worked but I wanted a little longer on the battery life so I ordered a second battery. Buy the GAMA SONIC battery ONLY. The battery recommended for this fan on the page will NOT fit. Next tailgate I told my husband NOT to remove the charging plug from the back and to throw the whole thing in the car. The radio worked great! The plug acts as an antenna and it was pretty loud for a small speaker. The fan lasted the whole tailgate on high with the radio on. I haven&rsquo;t run the battery down all the way again yet. It puts out a pretty decent breeze and we have used it several times already. It also worked well when the grill was really smoking to blow the smoke away from us, much better. I can only hope the games get scheduled a little later in the day but we will still be using this fan because it gets HOT in Florida. Several people around us have since gotten this fan just from them watching us and asking about it. I also like the fact the in the h season it is a backup if we have no power and therefore no a/c.</p>

<h5 id="great-fan-that-will-keep-you-cool-love-it">Great fan that will keep you cool, love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this radio several months ago and never used it till about two weeks ago. The fan produces lots of refreshing wind as a good fan should. I tried and tried to get the radio to work. I scoured the manual to see if I was missing an antenna . Nope. I contacted Gama Sonic which were very helpful and responded to all my questions. I moved the fan closer to a window and it worked! So not really the fan at fault, just me. I would recommend this fan to everyone who is interested in a small fan with radio. It even runs on battery like a champ! This fan will keep you cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-camping-when-there-s-no-power">Great for camping when there&rsquo;s no power!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have been very please with this fan. It sure came in handy when we dry camped in our travel trailer last summer. We had purchased several extra generic batteries for it that we were able to recharge with our solar panel. With 2 batteries installed the fan lasted almost the whole night keeping us as cool as possible in the summer heat. I like that it oscillates so we could &ldquo;share the breeze&rdquo;I have never tried the radio, as we didn&rsquo;t need it ( we use an iPod on a rechargeable speaker dock). But it would be a nice thing to have during a power outage when we have hurricanes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like this product. pretty strong than other battery operated fans. It&rsquo;s not noisy at all. But the grille of the fan doesn&rsquo;t really work. It just gives steady flow of air. Having the radio is really ok during power outage and typhoon seasons so we can listen to news even if the battery is really low. Just wish it works longer than 4-5 hours. I never tried it with a music player since the sound is not really that good. Overall, it serves it purpose, so I&rsquo;m satisfied with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-lovely">Very lovely</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great fan, work perfectly for me. Lasted all nights with 2 batteries, and can even work continuously for days with Solar connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-functional">Not functional.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the item and when I read the instructions, was advised the AM radio could not be used when the fan was being used. The whole idea of this item is to listen to the radio while the fan keeps you cool. The product description made no mention of this limitation. I have returned it. Not worth the price.</p>
