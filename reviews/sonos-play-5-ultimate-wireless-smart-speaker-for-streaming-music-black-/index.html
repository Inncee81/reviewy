<h5 id="play-5-gen-2">Play 5 Gen 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had a songs system for many years now, starting out with the songs connect so I could use all my current setup and equipment. Three years ago I started getting the Play 1&rsquo;s, and those kept multiplying until I have a large herd of them around the house.I had listened to the play 3 and old generation play 5 and thought for the most part the new tech in the Play 1&rsquo;s are superior.Now enter the new Play 5 with all the new tech and more and better speakers. I initially got one thinking I could do a stereo pair and compare it with the Play 1. That was a no go. Sonos software does not allow this pairing. Only like with like. So now I had to order another one, ouch that was costly.Now that they are all setup in a stereo pair and did the custom sound procedure that sonos developed, they sound great. I did a side by side with the paired Play 1&rsquo;s and here is my findings. They both sound great. They both have great bass response and highs. Where they part ways is the midranges, the detail, and the soundstage.The Play 5&rsquo;s take what was good in the Play 1&rsquo;s and make it better. They are also a lot louder for when you really want to pump some sound. You don&rsquo;t need the sub with the Play 5&rsquo;s. I have one, but it is really not needed anymore. The sub still does well for sure, but its kind of like there is a baby sub in each play five and the sub goes, Hey Im Here Too&hellip; Hey You Still Need Me Right?The Play 5&rsquo;s are big and very heavy. About fourteen pounds each. Solid as a rock. Each speaker inside the Play 5 has its own amp.I am glad I have them, but it was painful buying two. You really don&rsquo;t need two for a pretty big room unless you want to pair them in stereo. The also can sense how you place them and the sound is changed automatically for vertical and horizontal. Horizontal does sound a bit better but I prefer the look of the vertical on my shelves. Also takes up less room and I did not have much to spare where I placed them.A little side note for those who have connection or interference issues. Do not buy a bridge, those are semi worthless. The Boost is much better. And something they don&rsquo;t advertise is that the sonos connect has the most powerful transmitter that will cut through interference like a light saber. I was running my system in a long house without it and was having connection problems all over the place. Hooked the connect back up in the middle of the house and it took over the signal from the boost. No more drops. Did not even have the connect connected to anything other than the ethernet.</p>

<h5 id="spectacular-audio-fidelity-simple-intuitive-software">Spectacular audio fidelity, simple intuitive software</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I write contemporary instrumental music and use professional studio monitor speakers to mix the final songs. In addition they are mastered by a professional engineer. This gives me a very good feel for how well audio systems perform, by using my finished songs as standards. Regarding Sonos sound, the speaker default bass is definitely too high. That is easily attenuated with the controls on your computer or phone. After that change I can say with confidence that this speaker has remarkable fidelity over nearly the full range of volume. The frequency response is simply phenomenal. Volume is more than adequate for most purposes.The software is very intuitive, at least on my iOS or Mac systems. Once plugged in, it took me 5 minutes to begin playing music from my Apple music account or from my personal collection. I was never confused as to what to do - set up is very straightforward and expertly guided.I only have one speaker now but plan to buy another later on. I will update my review at that time.</p>

<h5 id="great-upgrade">Great upgrade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had Sonos Play:3 for about couple years and was extremely happy with the ease of use and the second. The new Play:5 is a HUGE upgrade. You can feel it in both the bass and the treble ends. The clarity of the sound seemed to be improved as well. For me - definitely worth the money to upgrade! Thanks Sonos for the awesome product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow-wow-wow">Wow..wow..wow..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has my head been in the sand for this long? The packaging reminded me of how Apple packages there stuff which is fantastic. The craftsmanship is top shelf, the set-up was a breeze, and the sound quality offers deep basses, great midrange and crisp highs. I am not a true audiophile but this Sonos 5 sounds as good, or better, than my Polk speakers in my family room. I&rsquo;m very impressed.</p>

<h5 id="work-ed-great-for-2-months-but-they-are-fixing-the-issue">Work(ed) great for 2 months. But they are fixing the issue.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first I loved this product. I purchased for a client looking for a whole home wireless audio option. Product worker great for about 2 months. Just now the wireless card went out in the item. Looking online this has had a couple of issues with users. I reached out to support and they are sending a new unit to me to swap out so that is good and should be back to 5 stars as long as this was a fluke instance. If it happens again I may have to change this to a 3 star. But when it is working it is amazing.</p>

<p>Amazin&rsquo;, wonderfull&hellip;. another SONOS awesome product!.. The top controls are excellent!, letting you change the songs without the app. The same stunning sound or all SONOS equipments. Money well spent!.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-insanely-great-speakers-purchased-several-months-ago-and-have-been">these are insanely great speakers. Purchased several months ago and have been &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG, these are insanely great speakers. Purchased several months ago and have been using them at low- to mid-level volume and thought they were great. Neighbor is on vacation this week, so I thought I&rsquo;d test them out. So crisp, clear and full, even at full, blasting levels, you seriously can&rsquo;t believe such sound could come out of such a small package. I bought two for stereo. Yes, they&rsquo;re pricey, but you really couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better wireless speaker system. Trust me, no sub-woofer is required for full low-range sound.</p>

<p>Best speaker I have ever owned I bought at least four for friends and family my nephew told me it was the best Christmas present he ever had my daughter uses it every single day In her home. I rented a house in Annapolis Maryland for a trade show and the owner had one and every room of his house including his television set I simply downloaded his system to my iPhone and was able to play music in any room at anytime that I want</p>
