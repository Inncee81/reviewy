<h5 id="the-perfect-replacement-part">The Perfect Replacement Part</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I am the first to review this item but I&rsquo;m sure I am not the first to buy it. More people should review these things&hellip; But yeah this is the digitizer to get if you broke your iPad&rsquo;s touch panel. I was hesitant at first because I had previously tried another generic (non-OEM) replacement part from another source here on Amazon and it worked kind of at first and then had problems and was thinking I was touching the screen and wasn&rsquo;t. Soon it was freaking out. Not to mention it broke easily.This part however has impressed me. Not only does it come with the crazy important adhesive that no other digitizer seems to come with nowadays, it works perfectly. It set in better than the last and makes my iPad look brand new. Installation was effortless.I encourage you to purchase this part because it is and works as described. It may be a bit more expensive than the generics but it is not some cheap off brand part. If you want something that works then you gotta pay it bit more.</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-check-the-home-button-before-you-install">Buyer beware, check the home button before you install!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the screen, I installed it, a d the screen itself works without a hitch. The home button however is where I ran into problems. The home button is strangely mushy and often gets stuck in the pressed down position. This is quite annoying as the home button before was clicky and responsive. It&rsquo;s not an isolated incident either as after just a few minutes research i found a plethora of users with the same issue. Some tried replacing several screens with still no luck. Others suggest putting some tape around the home button but there were no instructions telling me to do anything to the home button so I installed it as it was. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I&rsquo;m in no mood to take apart my iPad again after painstakingly melting the adhesive and evvvvver so carefully prying the display away. Not to mention going over the LCD with a magnifying glass to ensure no dust was left behind. I&rsquo;ve done my fair share of screen replacements over the years but put by far the most time and care into this one to make sure it was absolutely perfect. This product can get no better than a Star for this, I&rsquo;m really not pleased. I can&rsquo;t return it without removing it from the iPad either so I&rsquo;m stuck. Buyer beware, check your home button before you install.</p>

<h5 id="remove-the-protective-film-and-it-looks-much-better">Remove the protective film and it looks much better! :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the screen and was bummed to see that the glass had fine scratches. I promptly filed a return ticket. Within hours on a Saturday afternoon I got a response back from Henry. He courteously suggested that I remove the protective film. Boy, did I feel like a dope. Anyway, I removed the film&hellip; and the glass looked much clearer! :-) I installed the screen and everything works great. It was really convenient to have the home button, ribbons, and adhesive all attached to the screen. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has got a cracked screen&hellip;. just make sure you peel off the protective film. Ha ha!</p>

<h5 id="this-review-is-for-the-ipad-air-5th-gen-touchscreen-white-replacement-sold-by-winmaxcn">This review is for the iPad Air (5th Gen) Touchscreen (White) Replacement sold by winmaxcn</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased August 3rd 2015&hellip;it worked at first, now I have to replace again :( the home button is still functioning but has come out of it bracket. The most annoying part that I have been dealing with is the steadily increasing number of dead spots on the digitizer. I can still use it for the most part but there is about a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-1/2in strip across the center and an <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-1/4in strip top to bottom that has completely failed&hellip;you know,&hellip;the spot where you normally use to swipe L/R or scroll. :-\ When I am scrolling down a website I have to remember to just use the top or bottom of the screen otherwise it will jump. I can tell other spots are forming because sometimes within apps or webpages I will click a link and nothing happens so I will move on and click another link and after that link is loaded and I am browsing the 1st link will all of a sudden kick in and boot me off wherever I was and into its destination&hellip;.super delayed response.</p>

<h5 id="second-ones-a-charm">Second ones a charm!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first attempt destroyed this digitizer, their website had no step by step instructions for the Air. In the end I had ghosting issues which made the iPad totally useless and when I tried to remove the glass to fix it I cracked it. $40 down the toilet so I was really dissapointed. through some online research I discovered that even people who professionally repair the Air digitizers were having a problem and only a few manufacturers didn&rsquo;t ghost, It turns out the issue is the sensetivity at the edge of the glass and requires a special tape put on before you install it. Since I followed the instructions online my second Mimi digitizer has worked perfectly. The tape is called kapton tape and Amazon sells it cheap, just do a google search and you will find good examples of how to apply it to the edge and along with this digitizer you should have no issues. 1 Mil Kapton Tape (Polyimide) - <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; will work. Other than that just take your time and let the heat gun loosen the edges, never force the glass, remove the inner film before you adhere it in place, oh and try to put all the screws back where you found them.</p>

<h5 id="look-out-on-this-one-extremely-low-end-materials">Look out on this one! Extremely low end materials.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product was super cheap and cracked after a week. One time in my wife purse was all it took. The screen cracked right in half!Super cheap materials and just plain inferior product. This was a simple replacement and only because my home button was broken. I have replaced iPad screens several times and did this one flawlessly. Its just super crappy materials.AND to top it off the home button fell through immediately. I took it as a loss on the home button because I didn&rsquo;t feel like dealing with it again but after the screen cracked in half for pretty much no reason at all I had to say something.Avoid this seller and this product completely! Not worth the savings (what savings as now I have to purchase another).</p>

<p>Other manufacturers ship with a tool kit included, but this product is just the iPad screen - without any packaging or instructions.</p>
