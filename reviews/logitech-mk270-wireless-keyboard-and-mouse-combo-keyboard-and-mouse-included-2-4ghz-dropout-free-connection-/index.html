<h5 id="be-aware-two-different-versions-out-there">Be aware - two different versions out there</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered it on <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> from Amazon and received a couple of days later. To my surprise, the box doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;unifying receiver&rdquo;. Took the keyboard/mouse out - yes indeed the receiver only says &ldquo;Nano Receiver&rdquo;, and it doesn&rsquo;t have the orange star unifying logo. I also installed Logitech Unifying software but this receiver is not recognized.UPC/Product ID all match. Appears Logitech changed the product. Amazon needs to change the product description.If you are looking for a unifying receiver to work with other logitech products, don&rsquo;t buy this.Update - Amazon sent me a replacement, and this time it comes with Unifying receiver. UPC and product ID printed on the boxes are identical, packagings are slightly different. One has &ldquo;Unifying receiver&rdquo; clearly printed on the box and feature list and the other one doesn&rsquo;t.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00BP5KOPA/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_img0Keyboards">http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00BP5KOPA/ref=cm_cr_dp_cust_img_see_all_img0Keyboards</a> and mice are also different. One set both have orange star unifying on the label and the other set don&rsquo;t. Product IDs are different too.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-so-very-happy-with-my-new-keyboard-and-mouse">I&rsquo;m so very happy with my new keyboard and mouse!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love, love, love my new Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse! It took me about 2 days to figure out which one to order and I&rsquo;m just so glad I decided on this one. There are so many to choose from, but I knew mine had to be wireless, have a 10 key keyboard on the right side and be large enough, but not too bulky. I also wanted one with the right sized letter keys. It&rsquo;s perfectly sized for using on top of my little portable laptop desk and it&rsquo;s so easy to pair with my laptop. There are little legs on the bottom, if you like to prop it up at an angle.What I really love about this set is the simplicity, when it comes to setting it up. Just plop 2 AAA batteries into the back of the keyboard, put a AA battery into the mouse and stick the little nano receiver into your laptop&rsquo;s USB port. Next just turn on both the keyboard and the mouse and &lsquo;Voila!&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re good to go! At least that was my experience. I&rsquo;m not a person in a rush any more and I tend to just go with the flow nowadays. Since I&rsquo;m also now retired, I&rsquo;ve just slowed everything I do, down to a slow crawl&hellip;and maybe that&rsquo;s why I like the plain and simple quality of this keyboard and mouse. It&rsquo;s nothing fancy and that&rsquo;s just fine with me. Comes with a great price tag too!</p>

<h5 id="great-combo-purchased-two">Great combo, Purchased two</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now purchased two of the MK270 combos and love them. The first was a ways back for my work laptop, Windows 7 based computer. Plugged in the tiny USB hub and both the keyboard and mouse were working in seconds. I like the larger keyboard for the number pad and the various shortcut keys at the top that all function nicely (volume up and down, mute, email, browser launch, even calculator). Let&rsquo;s me be comfortable while I type. Mouse is small but I like that, never one for bulky mice. And the USB hub fits nicely into the mouse should you need to pack it up.Purchased the second for my Chromebook and it was up and running even faster than my laptop. Couldn&rsquo;t believe how nicely it works. My kids do a lot of internet based homework for school and again the separate number pad makes life easier for them as they work through their math homework. Mouse is far easier for them than the touch pad on the Chromebook.Finally, what I did not realize is that the keyboard and mouse both have an effective range of 20-30 feet (perhaps more). I just had surgery and was confined to bed for a week. I hooked my laptop up to my LED Flat Screen, and then laid in bed with the keyboard and mouse, a good 10-15 feet away, and was able to do work and keep myself entertained. Loved that I could leave the laptop sitting elsewhere and never had to get up to do anything with it, just used the keyboard and mouse as I normally would. And last night we were at my in laws and streaming something on the Chromebook. Everyone wanted to see it so we hooked it up to their 60&rdquo; LED and used the mouse from across the room (a good 20 feet) to switch between videos. Again, the Chromebook was right next to the TV and sound system, and we handled everything from across the room. Not a big deal to some, but a really nice side benefit for those of us who periodically like to hook up our laptops to the home entertainment system.I usually try to turn the keyboard and mouse off but often forget at my work computer. They either use no battery power or they have an auto-off function because I&rsquo;ve replaced the AA battery once in two years.</p>

<h5 id="wireless-isn-t-for-everyone">Wireless isn&rsquo;t for everyone &hellip; . .</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are ok, when they work. My issue, and maybe its just not changing the batteries frequently enough or what, but it seems these are never happy unless the have a clear line of sight to the dongle. Just typing on the coffee table 6 ft. away doesn&rsquo;t always work, without having to lift up the keyboard &hellip; very frustrating, and I hate the lag on the mouse at times. I will note that when I plugged the dongle into a USB 3.0 port it was even worse, so watch out for that too. I have gotten so jaded with wireless K/M I actually installed and paid for Unified Remote on my phone, which works a lot better, and I can use it on multiple boxes, so I don&rsquo;t have to keep buying more. People are typically in love with wireless keyboards and mice or not, and I am in the later group. I only use them when I have too, such as with a HTPC, and even then they always seem to have issues at the worst possible times. I suppose a higher end model might work better, but I&rsquo;ll stick with my $3.99 phone app for now, and begrudgingly use this when I have too &hellip; .</p>
