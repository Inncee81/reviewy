<h5 id="drive-60-lmt-vs-drivesmart-60-lmt">Drive 60 LMT vs. DriveSmart 60 LMT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I may just be a picky user, but figured my review my help others decide on what device to buy. I originally updated to a Garmin Drive 60 LMT from an older Nuvi 1450 LMT. Screen size and smoothness/speed were main considerations. Shortly after purchasing, updating software and maps, and installing in my car I was disappointed. The 6&rdquo; screen is nice and big but&hellip;.it is nowhere near as bright as the older versions. At 100% brightness it was about as bright as the Nuvi 1450 at 40 - 50% brightness. Likewise, if you wear polarized sunglasses, it will make the screen even darker (practically unreadable in some cases). I contacted Garmin and they confirmed that they polarize the screen on this device and, unfortunately, orient the polarization to interfere with polarized sunglasses. Everything else was great. That being said, if this doesn&rsquo;t bother you, or you only drive in overcast/dark conditions, you should be fine. I ended up returning and replacing with a DriveSmart 60 LMT (I did have to pay a little more obviously). Completely different device. Brighter, sharper/crisper screen, and not subject to polarized sunglass issues. That along with the other added features (bluetooth, voice command, swipe touch screen, etc.). My only gripe, and I&rsquo;ll be fine with it, is that to get the nice crisp and sharp graphics, Garmin used a glass screen that is not matte. Therefore, you see fingerprints easier, and it is reflective. If you&rsquo;re looking at both, maybe this observation will help. You can add a matte screen protector but I&rsquo;ve found that those will make the screen less crisp sharp (especially text).</p>

<h5 id="the-reasons-i-like-this-better-than-google-maps">The reasons I like this better than google maps</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Garmin Drive 50 USA LMI bought this GPS unit as a backup for google maps on my Nexus 5 for a cross country trip from IL to CA. Surprisingly by the end of the trip, I found myself using the Garmin about 99% of the time. I am comparing this unit against google maps that I use 99% of the time otherwise.The reasons I like this better than google maps:1. The split screen was really informative - especially with large lane guidance in unfamiliar areas and upcoming stops displayed next to the map without having to navigate away from the live map. This may not be a problem with long stretches of roads but in a city for example, the ability to show important stops like gas, food and rest stops without having to risk going away from the map and losing a turn.2. The &ldquo;Up next&rdquo; info was probably the most useful feature for me as the three most important things during a long trip Viz. Food, Fuel and rest areas are very conveniently shown next to the map. This allowed me to get fuel at the upcoming gas station if the next one after that (whose distance was also shown as part of what&rsquo;s up next information) was going to be 100 miles away. This saved my from running out of fuel a couple of times in the middle of the AZ/NM/NV area.3. The current speed limit was very helpful and I found it was about 100 yards off from the signs posted (i.e. the GPS took about 100 yards to catch up with the posted speed limit signs). This is better than google maps which does not have any such information at all.4. Offline navigation! This in itself was the main reason I brought a dedicated GPS unit and I was not disappointed! I shudder to think of not having navigation in the middle of Arizona/Utah because of lack of phone coverage.After using a dedicated GPS (while coming from a position of skepticism of it&rsquo;s usefulness over google maps), I will say that I probably will be using this GPS for all my long distance driving over using my phone (and leave my phone always connected to the charger). But for inner city navigation, I still prefer google maps/waze for almost instantaneous traffic based navigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just ok for the price. Go for the cheaper version if available. Nothing extra at the price but overall serves well that can be achieved by cheaper versions as well.</p>

<h5 id="fortunate-buy">Fortunate Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Accurate. Easy to read even with polarized sunglasses. Adjusts relatively quickly when I stray from the interstate to a slower, smaller, more cynic route. Calculates the adjusted estimated arrival time. I love the landmark, restaurant and gas company icons and especially appreciate the weather and accident-ahead warnings. I first used my Garmin Drive USA + CAN LMT on my move across country. It continues to be invaluable in my new city. It definitely has been worth the money.</p>

<h5 id="overdue-but-much-appreciated-prouct">OVERDUE, BUT MUCH APPRECIATED PROUCT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This updated device includes speed/red light camera alerts. It is allegedly part of the lifetime map features,so whenever maps are updated, so are the camera locations. Hopefully, there will be no future ambushesrequiring a subscription to &ldquo;safety&rdquo; cameras, as Garmin&rsquo;s website description does not mention any. Overall,this advanced unit does much more for the same price paid for a similar Garmin unit some years back. SinceI&rsquo;ve already been alerted to a load of cameras (NYC/LI, gouge capitals of the world), &amp; not been side-swiped with multiple fines, it has paid for itself, &amp; now is in complete profit mode. It does not promote speeding,but we cannot constantly look @ speedometers while driving, nor have a talking one constantly grating in ourears with an obnoxious voice, even if it can be turned off on demand. This way, chimes &amp; written warningshighlight upcoming problems well in advance, allowing time to decrease speed @, or below the posted limit.My gratitude to Garmin for producing this invaluable tool as others have, &amp; to Amazon for its expedited delivery.</p>

<h5 id="great-on-directions-and-display">Great on directions and display!</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great help when I need directions. The screen is a great size&ndash;easy to see. My only complaint is that there are only two voices from which to choose.</p>

<p>This unit replaces a Garmin Nuvi that became erratic in it&rsquo;s operation. The Drive 50 is very similar, but newer software.</p>
