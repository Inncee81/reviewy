<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product-sparse-packaging">Great product- sparse packaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product arrives it it own package which is surprising given the value. Clearly no money wasted on pretty packaging such as that the Sonos Playbar comes in. Plain brown box. As for the unit it comes with a wall mounting plate but no hardware to mount to the wall. The unit itself was easy to set up and the learning function was easy and worked the first time using a Time Warner remote. Once I got it setup the sound is excellent as promised. But the sound level does not actually deliver any sound at all until you reach 30 on the sound scale. This is surprising and makes little sense. That being said the sound bar will push way beyond that level and it rocks. Sound sound output is not a problem.Highly recommended, sounds great understand it will improve after 10+ hours of use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-will-never-look-back">I will never look back!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Damn. Just, damn. It is such pure, clear, amazoning, powerful sound! I have it in my cutting room at our hair salon and my customers are just in awe! So many have asked me where the subwoofer is! I was totally going to get one but I just dont see how it could need it! Well done Paradigm!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">Wow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took a chance with limited reviews available (anywhere) for this sound bar and I&rsquo;m VERY happy with it! Rich full sound, clarity is fantastic. Movies and music. Thank you to the few reviews I found that convinced me to make this purchase. I&rsquo;d highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sound-quality-is-very-nice-i-would-have-give-this-5-stars-rating">Sound quality is very nice. I would have give this 5 stars rating &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this soundbar for over a year now. Sound quality is very nice. I would have give this 5 stars rating if it has additional input such as HDMI. I don&rsquo;t really like the optical connection. It is really flimsy. Beside that, I have no complaint about this soundbar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-have-enjoyed-using-this-product">I really have enjoyed using this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really have enjoyed using this product. The sound quality is excellent for a soundbar, and was a good balance between wanting a minimal install, and having a full blown surround sound system. Mounting on the wall under my TV was easy. The wireless sub transmitter that comes with it is a great feature! I was able to to hook the transmitter up to my Gemini studio (non-consumer) sub using an adapter (Monoprice 104775 1.5-Feet Premier Series XLR Male to RCA Male 16AWG Cable). This leads me to believe it would work with almost any powered sub. I&rsquo;m not in love with the menu system, but once it&rsquo;s adjusted, there was no need to change anything again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="spectacular-sound-with-movies-and-music">Spectacular sound with movies and music.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update 12/17/2015Amazing sound but had to return it for repair. Some movie content with sub-bass started rattling or vibrating some components inside at higher volume, even at 60%. I don&rsquo;t know if sound engineers or mixers are starting to have their interns mix soundtracks for movies and tv shows or they&rsquo;re getting sloppy but &mdash;-. This is disappointing because at first they send me a woofer to replace as I though the issue is with the woofer. That was not the case, I replaced the woofer and the rattling or vibrating sound was still there coming from inside of the unit. I say there is definitely some inconsitancy with the production of this soundbar and I am hopefull that they will fix the unit I sent back as it&rsquo;s still in warranty. It was fine for the first Few months but then the issue happened. I guess some content has more sub-bass than other and it does take a toll on the unit. It&rsquo;s in fortunate thatfor this money the unit didn&rsquo;t last that long and on top of that I have to now wait a few weeks for it to be repaired. With that said, the sound on this thing is very very very good, so I&rsquo;m hopeful they will fix it soon. I didn&rsquo;t audition any other expensive soundbar so I can&rsquo;t say that others are worse or better but still, I think we&rsquo;re at a point where you can&rsquo;t really trust most online reviews anymore, even ones from so &ldquo;legit&rdquo; places. Yea but I guess we all know that, riigggghhht! :)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Oh thanks Apple for removing optical out on ATV4, I completely didn&rsquo;t get the memo that we should be upgrading our TVs and other devices every year, so that we are all on the same upgrade treadmill.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Spectacular sound with movies and music after a break-in period of about 10+ hours. Be patient for the first day or two. Once the components adjust to your environment you will notice an immediate change in the sound and be blown away. Your ears will just know once you hear it, opening up after the break-in period. Mechanical components of this high quality take some time to settle in with temperature, humidity and atmospheric conditions.Easy operation, auto dimming display, Bluetooth, two optical ins, program it to respond to most IR remotes.The product design has a gorgeous metallic quality that feels very solid (not bulky) yet rich and very refined.Sound for movies is clear, thick, powerful and defined. Sometimes so realistic that you may think the characters and the action is taking place right inside your room. There is a specific quality to the sound that&rsquo;s hard to explain. The sound stage isn&rsquo;t very large but that&rsquo;s the physics of a sound bar. However the clarity and 3D dimensional quality of the sounds is amazing. For music it sounds better (more detailed) than my focal pro cms 40 studio monitors. This soundscape has theater sound for movies, with impactful explosions, crispy sound effects and extremely low rumbles that are very defined with clear dialog which is concise and centered. The built-in sub is pure awesomeness going down to 30hz din. You can add another sub instead if you want via the included wireless transmitter but even without it it blows away anything else out there. The sound is very lively and fun yet very flat clearly illustrating an audio quality the way the artists intended. It doesn&rsquo;t sound wimpy but at the same time it doesn&rsquo;t sound overpowering and boomy (or cheap) but it can be very kicking when you want all the while preserving the hi-fidelity sound quality. Even at low volume the dialog can be clearly heard from my other room.Keep surround ON for movie mode. For music mode turn surround OFF to hear a more dynamic image. Keep the loudness setting to OFF for music but turn it ON for movies if you want a slightly wider soundstage with more omph for sound effects, soundtrack and a thicker deeper dialog voices enhancing the theater effect. For caual tv watching or late at night I would keep loudness setting to off.I tried to add a subwoofer however I didn&rsquo;t like missing out on the 30-80hz frequencies reproduced by this soundbar so I went back to using just the soundbar without a sub. Perhaps I need to try it with a better subwoofer. For now I don&rsquo;t feel I need a sub as the Paradigm Soundscape seems to be doing just fine without one.The Paradigm Soundscape is able to handle any music genre amazingly well without you having to fiddle with eq. It&rsquo;s almost as if it knows what type of music it is playing and it is magically reproducing the track just in a perfectly clear and open way for your ears to hear it.The sounds coming out of this are absolutely spectacular.</p>

<h5 id="solid-authoritative-cinema-or-music-sound-without-the-need-for-an-a-v-receiver-and-separate-speakers">Solid, authoritative cinema or music sound without the need for an A/V receiver and separate speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid, authoritative cinema or music sound without the need for an A/V receiver and separate speakers. The 20 pound enclosure houses seven (7) 50 watt speakers, each with their own dedicated amplifier. Bass and mid-range are immediately &ldquo;there,&rdquo; which was an unexpected delight from a soundbar. Added an SVS SB-2000 subwoofer which seemed to open-up the soundstage even more.Connecting the audio outputs (Blu-ray player &amp; DIRECTV DVR tuner) directly to the soundbar inputs using digital coax or digital optical cable allowed the Paradigm SHIFT Soundscape Soundbar to reproduce awesome DTS or Dolby sound through its seven speakers. Highly recommended!</p>
