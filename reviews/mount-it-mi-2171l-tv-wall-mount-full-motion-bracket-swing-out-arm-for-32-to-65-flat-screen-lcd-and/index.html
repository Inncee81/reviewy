<h5 id="excellent-choice-for-an-articulating-mount-i-love-it-with-some-minor-annoyances">EXCELLENT choice for an articulating mount! I love it with some minor annoyances!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent quality, heavy, sturdy mount. The guy who installed it, and that is his full-time job, commented on how he was impressed with the quality of it. It by far exceeds my expectations in every way. It is very flexible and will turn in my living area a full 270 degrees. I highly recommend this mount and would definitely purchase it again. Here are my only complaints and the reason why I am only giving 4 stars and not 5:1) It is hard to get the mount to move. It takes considerable effort to pull it out from the wall. It angles very easily, but pulling it away from the wall and back into the wall are a challenge! I hope i gets easier over time, or maybe just needs some WD40 or something. Not sure2) Some mounts have a nice built-in level gauge. This mount has the ability to tilt an an angle, which is awesome, EXCEPT that since it requires force to pull away from the wall, it always seems to tilt the TV either left or right-lopsided. And without a level, I can&rsquo;t tell when I am standing up at the TV if it is crooked or not. So I have left a level close to the TV.There you have it. I am enjoying my flat screen being mounted, and this is an awesome mount with some minor annoyances.</p>

<h5 id="great-arm-for-tv-very-strong-and-extends-out-pretty-far">great arm for tv, very strong and extends out pretty far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a real review, I paid full price for this itemgreat arm! you&rsquo;ll definitely need a hand putting it up, it&rsquo;s pretty heavy. I used it to put up a Samsung 55 inch tv. the screws that come with it are too long, don&rsquo;t try to force them in or you&rsquo;ll poke right through the screen. I ended up using 4 washers under each screw head to make it about 8mm shorter, saved me a trip to the hardware store. just make sure you use enough washers or you&rsquo;ll damage your tv. Other than that, you will also need to adjust the tension of the bolts with the allen keys that are included. the built-in level definitely helps, just attach one of the holes first and don&rsquo;t tighten all the way, then you can pivot it with the arm extended to make it level. the arm itself feels very sturdy, I&rsquo;ve seen much heavier arms in hotels with smaller tvs that feel real flimsy, this one feels very solid and it&rsquo;s not a small tv. It also folds down very small so that the tv can be pushed almost against the wall and it swings out pretty far (- a few inches)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-product-at-a-great-price">Amazing product at a great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an older, heavy 52&rdquo; plasma and I was sceptical that the mount could hold its weight. I purchased the product because of some of the other helpful reviews but ultimately because it had the longest extension of its competitors. I&rsquo;m happy to report that it&rsquo;s been working great for about a month now. I&rsquo;m able to fully turn my tv parallel to the wall. Some others mentioned that it&rsquo;s difficult to extend the arm but if you read the instructions, it explains how there are adjustments you can make that loosen the swivel. I loosened it a bit and greased it with WD-40 and it swivels with ease!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tank">Tank</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Build like a tank. It was easy enough to install I&rsquo;m a 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; man. I could see how some say its too heavy. i have a 58 inch TV and now I don&rsquo;t worry about it falling over and killing my kids. I can also move it and see the TV any where in the house.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-will-say-the-instructions-are-not-so-good-but-it-s-not-my-first-time-mounting-tv-s">I will say the instructions are not so good, but it&rsquo;s not my first time mounting TV&rsquo;s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow this sucker is heavy duty! It arrived on time. I have a 32&rdquo; flat pannel I wanted to hang on the wall, and have the ability to pull it away from the wall and swing it in the direction I wanted for viewing and gaming. It fills the bill. I will say the instructions are not so good, but it&rsquo;s not my first time mounting TV&rsquo;s. The motion is super stiff out of the box. I loosened the pivot points just a bit and worked it several times with the WD 40 lube applied. It&rsquo;s smooth as silk now. It sticks out from the wall more than I would like. as far as cable routing, you&rsquo;re on your own. When you push it back against the wall one of the pivot arms bangs into the wall bracket I stuck a piece of sticky felt in that area. It is HEAVY! Those are the reasons why I gave it a 3 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-wall-mount">SOLID WALL MOUNT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shipped quickly. Installed it in about 15 minutes with no help (granted I used an impact driver for the bolts). SUPER sturdy, veru heavy yes but you&rsquo;d want something heavy duty to hold up your flat screen tv wouldnt you??? I mounted my 55&rdquo; LCD to this thing holding my breath (the TV weighs darn near 70-80 lbs) but so far it&rsquo;s holding solid. You can&rsquo;t beat the articulation of this bracket, it moves the tv in out, left right, and tilts. No sag on the tilt at all. I would buy this thing again and again. My only comment would be to use your own level when installing, don&rsquo;t count on the built in level becuase it was off, at least on mine. But I didn&rsquo;t buy this for the level. Buy it, you own&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="heavy-but-sturdy">Heavy but Sturdy&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Install took around 30 mins and was able to accomplish myself. Have a new LG so the bolts for the tv were too long, but nothing a quick trip down to home depot didn&rsquo;t remedy. Had to flip over due to the location of my studs in a confined space. This mount will be there for life! Motion is great and easy enough for a small child to move TV around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-4-of-these-and-i-love-the-quality-and-structural-integrity-they-provide-for-all">I have (4) of these and I love the quality and structural integrity they provide for all &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have (4) of these and I love the quality and structural integrity they provide for all my TVs. The newer TVs are much lighter but I have one that is 100 lbs and no worries that the bracket will fail. The articulating features is awesome as well. I recommend this bracket to anyone worried about holding up to weight and motion of your TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-solid-mount">Good solid mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is worth the price. I use mine down stairs and it is moved alot. It is very sturdy but moves full range with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-mount-at-a-great-price">Solid mount at a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid mount at a great price. So far, after a couple months of holding a 55 inch TV, it appears to be holding up well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-it-was-easy-enough-to-figure-out-and-works-fine">but it was easy enough to figure out and works fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get any instructive with my box that I could find, but it was easy enough to figure out and works fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-as-described">Worked as described</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked as described, a little heavy but did the job</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly on my 60&rdquo; Samsung led.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works great especially since I have it across a corner..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very sturdy! Mounted inside an enclosed trailer with a 50 in tv and it works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-mounting-for-tv">Solid Mounting for TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Substantial mount, very solid. Easy to install even by myself. Do be careful to get the stud mountings level as there is very little leveling adjustment in the bracket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strong-steady-wall-mount">Strong Steady Wall Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Strong. Steady. Perfect wall mount for LG 55UH6030. I really like the movement. No sagging. This is a two person job. Have help.</p>
