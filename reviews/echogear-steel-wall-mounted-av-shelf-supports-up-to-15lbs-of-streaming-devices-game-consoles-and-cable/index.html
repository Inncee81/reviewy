<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="best-instruction-manual-ever">Best instruction manual ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to really say about something you mount to a wall to hold a piece of electronics. However the staff at Echogear wrote a tremendous instruction manual. I think this was the first time I&rsquo;ve ever had an instruction manual detailed enough and not have only pictures. Also whomever wrote the manual had a great sense of humor and had my wife and I entertained reading it. Great job! Attached some highlights for others to read</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-install">Easy install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installation was a breeze. The shelf is sturdy and is finished well.There&rsquo;s less room than the dimensions suggest because of the curved nature of the shelf vs a sqaure edge. The edges are NOT the dimensions listed.The two screws that hold the shelf are lacking. Since the screws are side by side,it allows the shelf to rock one way or the other if you load one end of the shelf. There should be either screws that match the screw hole size or the mount holes should protrude to lock the shelf in place. If you keep the items centered it likely wont be an issue however. If you handle items a lot on this shelf i would expect it to loosen.You can plainly see what i used this for. It barely fits however does work. Theres simply no wiggle room. If I would have noticed the dimensions provided were not including the edge of the shelf i would have tried something else because i needed the room towards the edge.This will work for the intended purpose but just barely with the smallest UPS i could find that had a removable battery from APC. In only deducted one star for the dimensions issue because it did end up OK for me.Photo will be added.</p>

<h5 id="nice-shelf">Nice Shelf</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have run a daycare in my home for over 20 years, it was time for a remodel of the room. I found several products on line but decided to go with this product. I was hoping for durability and I was very happy when it came in. This is VERY sturdy and holds up the items needed under the TV. I love how it looks sleek and like its floating on the wall. We didn&rsquo;t want tempered glass as most are made with. This product is made very nice. I do not think you will be disappointed. I do a lot of shopping on line and have to return products often, you will not have to do this with this product. I am giving this product a 5 Star.* 1 star (Nope, DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL!): I would either return or throw away this product. It was a waste of my money and not functional. I will never order again.** 2 star (Think twice before buying - don&rsquo;t like it): I&rsquo;m not a fan of this item and I won&rsquo;t order it again, but it has at least one positive quality.*** 3 star (It’s ok): This item has both positive and negative qualities. It may work for some people, but I wouldn&rsquo;t go out of my way to purchase or recommend it.**** 4 star (I like it): This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this (including pricing), but is a good product overall. I would use this item.***** 5 star (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product.All of my reviews are written with the hope of helping other Amazon customers make the right buying decisions for themselves. To help increase awareness of a particular product it might be positive or negative, but in the end it is honest. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it has helped you. I will be happy to answer any questions if that might help you make your decision. Have a great day.</p>

<h5 id="echogear-shelves-as-bed-side-tables">EchoGear shelves as bed side tables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product is well-made, description is accurate, delivery was fast. Installation was logical - tongue-in-cheek instructions were hilarious - wish more we written that way. Finish on product is good, construction is sturdy (especially if mounting in wall studs). Drywall anchors are not worthy of product. I would (and did) use a butterfly or spider molly expanding bolts for drywall.Some reviews mentioned a wobbly shelf. This is true - due to design - can be remedied by adding metal serrated to provide friction holding.Shelf is larger than similar competitors and reinforced to hold described object weights.End caps don&rsquo;t fit quite as tight after removal and reinsertion, but is a minor issue, undetectable at a glance.Very pleased with product, instructions, and mounting. Used as &ldquo;bed night stands&rdquo; to hold alarm clock, remotes, wireless router, books and pitcher.</p>

<h5 id="super-easy-and-sturdy">SUPER easy and sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SUPER easy and sturdy. The only recommendation I have is to widen the openings a little where the lag bolts go through the bracket and into the wall. As it is, you can use a socket or ratchet wrench only until the bolt head comes flush with the outer portion of the bracket and you have to use a screwdriver to tighten the rest of the way (a bit tough to do). If it were wider you could tighten it all the way with the socket wrench like the TV mount&hellip;much easier. Other than that it was great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wrong-measurements">Wrong measurements</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am frustrated with this product. I am giving it 2 stars instead one because one reason I don&rsquo;t like it is that I don&rsquo;t like th look of it. It looks cheap &amp; industrial. The missing 3 stars is because I feel deceived over the measuments. I correctly measured everything but the shelf is carvers (you cannot tell from the pictures) &amp; they measure from the longest point. Because of this, my Xbox hangs over on the corners by well over an inch. Will be returning &amp; ordering a rectangular shelf from a different company.</p>
