<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="nice-arbor-for-the-price">Nice Arbor for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice garden arch. I have 6 rose arbors. I prefer this one over the Gardman because it is assembled with metal unions, not plastic. The only plastic on this product is the finial. Mine shipped with green finials. I thought that was odd, so I used black Plasti-dip on them (from Home Depot paint dept).I wouldn&rsquo;t use this with heavy, woody climbers, but for my purposes (Joseph&rsquo; coat and Altissimo roses), it is fine.It was easy to assemble (sort screws by length before beginning).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="boooo">Boooo!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received a dud. In fact I just got finished disassembling the parts I put together and putting it right back in the box and returning it. Two of the parts were bent, which was not a big deal I was able to fix that(I thought) but when I carefully bend them back to place the paint just cracked and fell off exposing the metal underneath. The instructions are extremely vague with only a picture on one piece of paper to go by, and a poor guide to inventory all the hardware. As I&rsquo;m building I realize I do not have enough nuts and I&rsquo;m short about five screws. Then the icing on the cake was two of the parts for the arch are the wrong ones for this model! Lastly, this arch was not made for the outdoors. All of the hardware is not exterior and I see this thing turning into a rustbucket after a couple of rains. I&rsquo;m so angry it looks so nice in the picture! Waaaa!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unnecessarily-wonky">Unnecessarily wonky.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When put together, it is not necessarily symmetrical. It&rsquo;s out of whack. Yes, I am positive that I put it together correctly. It&rsquo;s just that some of the curved pieces that should be curved identically are not. We were able to get it to look pretty straight by strategic placement, but this should not have been necessary.If you have thin sturdy spikes, it is possible to put them into the ground and into the tubes at the bottom of the arch to further secure it to the ground. Note that the birds like to perch on it and do what birds do. If using this over any edible plant, be warned.The metal itself is strong. The instructions could be simplified with a few words or by labeling parts in a better way. In the end it looks pretty good.</p>

<h5 id="this-arch-arrived-well-on-time-and-looks-very-nice-it-was-easy-to-assemble">This arch arrived well on time and looks very nice. It was easy to assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This arch arrived well on time and looks very nice. It was easy to assemble. I want to take a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> star off, but can&rsquo;t. The reason is that the legs that stick into the ground are just too short, and I don&rsquo;t feel that it will stay in the ground during bad weather. We have grapes growing up the sides, but these are not yet growing, and as a result, there is no good assurance that the arch will stay put while the grapes grow back up again.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-think-a-strong-breeze-could-easily-topple-it-over-if-used-as-is-with-just">I would think a strong breeze could easily topple it over if used as is with just &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a little flimsy, but it will serve my purpose since I do not plan on using it for a vine. I bought 2 to make a &ldquo;cage&rdquo; around a small weeping fruit tree to keep the deer away by wrapping it with plastic deer fencing. I had to make it look decent for the Home Owner&rsquo;s Association. It really needs stakes that can be driven farther into the ground than the small bottom legs that are maybe 4 inches long. If you plan to use it for a vine, I would think a strong breeze could easily topple it over if used as is with just the small legs stuck in the ground. I drove 15 inch metal stakes half way into the ground and set the hollow legs over the top of the stakes before pushing the legs into the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-structure-looks-sturdy-and-was-not-very-hard">Nice structure, looks sturdy and was not very hard &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice structure, looks sturdy and was not very hard to put together. My only complaint is that while there are four sets of pieces 2 and 3 (the ones that form the arch), there seems to be only one perfect match per set, so it takes several tries to find it. It would have been helpful if the structure came with anchors or if the bottom legs were longer to provide better support. Otherwise, happy with the purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-good-lightweight-reasonable-price">Looks good lightweight reasonable price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with the trellis worked perfectly. My only complaint like others is why they didn&rsquo;t finish out the plastic top pieces black instead of green. It&rsquo;s lightweight but also inexpensive you get what you pay for but it will do the job for the vines.</p>

<h5 id="flower-lover">Flower lover</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Loved putting this Arbor in my back yard. Easy to assemble and already has four clematis&rsquo; climbing up the four legs.</p>

<h5 id="love-this">Love this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this!! It goes great with my colonial home. Can&rsquo;t wait to see my roses blooming on them. We did secure the posts into a longer PVC pipe into the ground until my roses can&hellip;</p>
