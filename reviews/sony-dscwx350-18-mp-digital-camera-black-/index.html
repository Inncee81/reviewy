<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Point and Shoot Digital Still Camera
You can’t do this with a smartphone. Snap pin-sharp, 18.2MP photos from afar with the 20x zoom camera that fits in your pocket. There’s also ultra-smooth recording that minimizes shake while shooting on the move, perfect for video lovers. Like taking shots in near darkness but hate disturbing the mood with a flash? The Exmor RCMOS image sensor harnesses lots of light to make candlelit moments really shine.</p>

<p>20x Optical/40x Clear Image Zoom G Lens
Get amazingly close with 20x optical zoom plus 40x Clear Image digital zoom. Most digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos.</p>

<p>Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and stills
Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and still images with the new BIONZ X processor and Optical SteadyShot Image Stabilization with Intelligent Active mode. When the processor and image stabilization technology work together they deliver sharp image quality with low noise and minimal blur even while the user is strolling and the camera is zoomed in.</p>

<p>20.4 MP Exmorr R CMOS Sensor for superb low light images
This camera features a 20.4 megapixel Exmor R CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera’s professional G Lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined Exmor R CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processor delivers extremely fast up to 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080p movie modes</p>

<p>Keep your subject in focus with Lock-On AF</p>

<p>Lock-On AF gives you the ability to focus on multiple points with subject recognition to keep your subject in sharp focus even when in motion.</p>

<p>Simple connectivity to smartphones via Wi-Fi or NFC3
Connectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi/NFC3 control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, the camera also supports NFC (near field communication) providing “one touch connection” convenience when transferring images to Android smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control — a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone — connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.</p>

<p>Motion-Shot Video traces subject movement
Motion-Shot Video traces subject movement on the camera’s LCD for a unique visual effect. Use this playback function on the camera to study form and pathways of subjects.</p>

<p>4K quality still image output via HDMI2
Enjoy the beauty of 4K quality still image (4x the resolution of Full HD) via simple HDMI connection to compatible 4K TVs2. The camera can also be connected via HDMI to HDTVs for full HD 1080p resolution images.</p>

<p>Sweep Panorama mode (up to 360°)
Reach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360° full circle, the camera can take a variety of panoramic shots. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.</p>

<p>Picture Effect for more expressive photos
Picture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects.</p>

<h5 id="best-pocket-point-shoot-big-improvement-over-wx300">Best Pocket Point &amp; Shoot - Big Improvement Over WX300</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A year ago I purchased the predecessor to this camera, the WX300. I had mixed feelings about it since I loved the long optical zoom, size and Wifi capabilities; however due to the extreme over-processing of the JPEG images from the tiny <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; sensor I wasn&rsquo;t pleased with the overly smoothed &ldquo;painted&rdquo; look, over noise corrected images (particularly when viewed at 100% on my monitor), so I returned it to my local BB.Now, when this current edition WX350 came out and I was able to see it and handle it a bit at the local store I was skeptical that it wouldn&rsquo;t be appreciably different than its predecessor. But, since the images tried in the store looked good I took a chance and bought it at a very good price (comparable to Amazon&rsquo;s). I&rsquo;ve been taking some test shots over the course of the last week, and also decided to take it to a kids&rsquo; soccer game this weekend and shot it alongside my Nikon D7000 DSLR with 18-200mm lens. Looking at the results, side-by-side in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.4, I was highly impressed! Not only did this little P&amp;S nail the focus in a fast moving sports activity at least 95% of the time, but the look of the JPEG files at 100% was much better than I had expected. At auto ISO captures between 80~800 there was minimal over sharpening and noise reduction, colors were bright and saturated (a tad bit more than my taste), and all were worthy of either larger size web presentation or printing up to 8x10 (maybe even 11x14) right out of the camera. The few videos I took also exhibited great focus tracking on the fly and the HD quality and sound were very nice. I&rsquo;m still playing with settings and seem to prefer the regular auto over the &ldquo;Intelligent Auto&rdquo; feature. I don&rsquo;t use the scene setting much since the basic auto setting actually selects these &ldquo;automagically.&ldquo;In the end, I had more off-focus images from the Nikon DSLR (set at auto focus point select and auto tracking) than on this minuscule Sony P&amp;S! I was shooting JPEGS (the only option) out of the WX350, and RAW images (later tweaked in Lightroom) out of the D7000. Needless to say, as a former professional photographer (now just having fun as a hobby), I feel that Sony has really delivered on this camera at an amazing price point with a quality build, to boot! I also don&rsquo;t really see the need for most users to go to Sony&rsquo;s flagship point and shoot cameras like the RX100 or RX100 MKII. Those do have the 1&rdquo; class sensor for less high ISO noise, but the new BIONZ X image processing (same as used in Sony&rsquo;s new full frame a7 full frame series cameras) makes the significant improvement in the WX350 over the WX300. Since most of the other specs in this camera didn&rsquo;t change over the WX300 I&rsquo;m guessing that the improved image processing has to be the result of the upgrade in image processing engine.You will find this camera hard to beat at the mid-two hundred dollar price range, and it should drop even further over the next 6 months. For the casual shooter, amateur, or pro the WX350 is an excellent primary P&amp;S or pocket back-up. Very quick into action with fast zoom, great video and fast focus it is now with me most of the time and is far faster to get into action than my cell phone camera. Speaking of that, having an Android phone with NFC, it&rsquo;s really cool to be able to pull up an image on the WX350 and tap it to my phone to copy the shot. Controlling the camera from my phone works great, too, although I don&rsquo;t know how often I would personally use this feature - perhaps for candids of kids or wildlife, or such. Oh yes, the battery life also is great, as well (good thing since you will need to charge the battery in the camera, tying it up (one downside, but you pay less for the absence of a dedicated charger).Finally, I have to say that I would buy the Sony DSC-WX350 again with no hesitation for a &ldquo;carry it everywhere, all the time&rdquo; camera that you can have confidence will provide the shots you need when you need them for much enjoyment&hellip;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get my hands on one of these, so I picked one up at the local BB, and I have to say, the wait was worth it. This is probably as close to a DSLR as you can get while still keeping the ease of a pocket sized point and shoot. It&rsquo;s laden with features, such as object tracking (think golf swing analysis!), lock in auto focus, which is great for movies&hellip;oh, and speaking of movies, it shoots full 1080p at 60p, and the image stabilization is incredibly efficient, even at the full 20x optical zoom. Smooth, smooth video on par with a GoPro without the fish eye effect.The sensor is amazing. extremely low light with no noise, and super crisp pictures&hellip;ALMOST on par with the NEX 5T. I generally give a camera the &ldquo;jeans&rdquo; test, where I shoot a close up of denim fabric, then blow it up to fullest magnification and look at the detail level. The detail level looks like a microscope&hellip;exactly what I look for.The LED display is fairly intuitive, is bright and crisp, so you get an excellent idea of how your pictures will look when printed. My only complaint is that I&rsquo;m used to a touch screen, which this doesn&rsquo;t have. Some people like that, some people don&rsquo;t. I would have preferred one as it makes navigating so much easier, but again, the point is quality photos and video. I&rsquo;ll throw a couple shots up so you can see for yourself.I won&rsquo;t say this is a steal at $299.00, but in this case, you DO get what you pay for.Great, great camera!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:Size20X Optical zoom (40X Digital)Excellent battery lifeGood image qualityVery good image stabilizerHD moviesCons:LED screen can be hard to see in bright sunlight.No viewfinderThis camera is easy to use. For those who want to shoot nice photos without fuss just choose the automated setting you prefer and forget about it. I find the automatic settings produce very good results over all. I think either the Intelligent Auto or Superior Auto (higher quality) setting will produce acceptable results in almost all situations. For movies just press the movie button on the top rear of the camera to begin recording and press it again to stop. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.I have found the auto focus to be quick and accurate under varying conditions. The only exception to this may be long telephoto shots in minimal light. For non telephoto shots in low light the camera has an auto focus illuminator which lights for a second to establish focus. This works well. The camera controls are easy to use and have a nice feel to them..It took a little while for me to get acquainted with Sony&rsquo;s menu system, but once you get the hang of where they put things, it&rsquo;s ok. Frequently adjusted settings such as flash on / off, single shot / burst mode and what info is displayed on the screen and can be selected quickly with one tap on the control wheel on the back of the camera with no need to go into the menus.Shooting still photos couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Aim and press the button, the camera does the rest. The camera produces good images.About Movies. A couple of things I noticed. The sound of the zoom motor that is picked up by the camera is minimal in my opinion. More noticeable was noise in the form of little clicks and squeaks introduced by my fingers physically handling the camera and operating the telephoto zoom switch. Considering the small size of the camera and the close proximity of your hands, controls and the microphones I think that most cameras of this type are going to pick up some sounds. With careful attention to your hands on the camera while shooting movies you should be able to minimize the amount of noise you introduce by physically handling the camera controls. The camera also has a wind noise reduction setting for shooting movies. It seems to be effective.I expected that the image quality of the camera at 20X zoom and especially at 40X (20X optical, 20X digital zoom) would be marginal at best. To my surprise I found that the image stabilization works exceptionally well and that hand held shots at 20X are quite acceptable, even at 40X you can anticipate acceptable results. I shot hand held videos of a hummingbird at a feeder at 30X and the video came out clear and in focus. Amazing.The manual states the camera can use SDHC or SDXC memory cards. When researching which camera to buy, I found conflicting information on various sites whether the SDXC cards were supported. I am happy to report that they are. I am using an SDXC Class 10, 80MB read/write speed, 64GB capacity card with no problems. I would recommend a fast card that can keep up with writing to the card while recording HD movies or taking burst shots. I have not experienced any problems using this card. The manual states that the camera has been tested to accept up to 64GB SDHC or SDXC cards. Implying that it may or may not support larger capacity cards. If you think 64GB may not be enough capacity for you, I might suggest buying extra 64GB cards rather than chancing a larger (and more expensive) card.The camera has a solid feel to it. Some reviews felt that the camera was so small that it was difficult to hold. I do not find this to be the case. I have large hands and have had no problems in that area.I purchased a separate Sony battery charger (Model No. BC-TRX) so I could be charging a battery while using the other battery in the camera. As for charge times. The initial charge using the camera to charge the battery took about 2 ½ hours. Using the Sony battery charger took about 2 hours to fully charge the battery. The difference in charge times may or may not be due to the amount of charge, if any, in the new battery to begin with.I don&rsquo;t have a need for WiFi, so I can&rsquo;t comment on that feature.For those who don&rsquo;t want to deal with a lot of manual settings to take good pictures, this camera should serve you well. If you want or need more manual control over your picture taking this likely isn&rsquo;t the camera for you.AN ADDITIONAL NOTE ON FLASH PHOTOS. Taking a flash photo that is very close to the subject, in my instance about 6&rdquo;, the cameras extended lens casts a small arched shadow in the lower left corner of the picture as it blocks the output of the flash in that direction. Otherwise, the picture taken this close with flash had a good exposure, not too bright or washed out as might be suspected. It looked good.</p>
