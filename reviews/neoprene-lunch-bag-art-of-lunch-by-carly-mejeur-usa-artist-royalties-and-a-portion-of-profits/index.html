</ul>

<p>Color:Carly Mejeur (Usa) - Loggerhead Sea Turtle
When lunchtime hits, you don&rsquo;t want to worry about your drink going warm or your food getting cold. That is why we developed the Art of Lunch Neoprene Lunch Tote. It looks better and works better than any other lunch totes we have come across, AND it lets us work with amazing artists from around the world to make lunch less boring.</p>

<p>We make our lunch totes with quality construction and thicker neoprene than the leading brand so your lunch will stand upright and it will keep your food at the right temperature until it is lunch time. When lunch is over and you&rsquo;re back home, our lunch tote conveniently folds and lays flat.</p>

<p>About the Artist</p>

<p>We are lovers of great art here at Art of Lunch and we wanted to incorporate that into our product. With this model, we had a chance to use one of our favorite designs from Carly Mejeur.</p>

<p>Carly Mejeur is a marine life artist and ocean advocate born and raised in South Florida. Her &ldquo;Nautical Chart Series&rdquo; connects the natural composition of land and sea with man made lines, soundings and titles. Using watercolor, she seamlessly ties the two together to pose the question, &ldquo;How do we interact with nature and how will we protect it?&rdquo; Her work has been featured as shirts and posters for ocean conservation organizations such as The Sea Turtle Conservancy, Beneath the Waves Film Festival, and Justin Riney&rsquo;s Expedition Florida 500. She continues to look for new ways to make a positive impact on the environment with her artwork.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="stated-size-is-misleading-base-to-zipper-is-only-9inches">Stated size is misleading, base to zipper is only 9inches.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited to come across this lunch box, that for the design alone I was willing to spend much more than I normally do on a lunch bag (to me, it screams DRAGON).Unfortunately, when the item description says 12x12 it means including the handles, not useable space. The other 2 dimensions fell short (width and base) but not as significantly as the height, which is only 9inches from base to zipper- photos with ruler. Much better suited to kids/teenagers and not adults.I sat and played around with different containers i have to try and figure out what the max capacity would be and if I need to return it. There is a photo showing exactly what I was able to fit in and how the lunch bag looked full. I was not able to fit my reusable water bottle, but was able to fit 2 store bought bottles. I was able to fit my smaller entree container, a snack container and a half-full quart sized ziplock bag. A slightly bigger entree container would&rsquo;ve prevented me from being able to put the water bottles inside.I have to play around some more and see what else I can do with this in order to decide if I&rsquo;m returning this lunch box. The design is truly beautiful, it came in good condition and the smell is minimal (but the tags do say to wash it before first use). But if I can&rsquo;t make it work for a 16hr day, I just can&rsquo;t justify keeping it. I will say that if my lunches were always going to be sandwiches, it&rsquo;d be fine but that&rsquo;s not realistic for me. I can&rsquo;t keep a lunch bag I have to buy special containers for or can only take certain lunches with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect lunch bag. The right size and feel. The material is just stretchy enough and comfortable to carry into work along with my purse, door badge, coffee cup, and any other miscellaneous items I am carrying lol. It&rsquo;s not bulky but fits alot of items. Definitely a good buy and I love that it&rsquo;s artsy and creative looking. Just do it, you will be happy with your purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="favourite-lunch-bag-i-ve-had-in-my-life">Favourite lunch bag I&rsquo;ve had in my life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best lunch bags I&rsquo;ve ever had. I love the neoprene material, it insulates warm foods and cold drinks, and the bag is suuuuuuuper roomy and fits so much in there (my lunch, by water bottle, my coffee tumbler, and my toothbrush and toothpaste for after lunch), but when it&rsquo;s empty it&rsquo;s soft and foldable enough to smush into my work bag when it&rsquo;s empty. It&rsquo;s machine washable, the zipper is smooth and doesn&rsquo;t get stuck, which is fantastic, and the handles are thick and soft enough that even when I&rsquo;ve stuffed the bag full and it&rsquo;s at it&rsquo;s heaviest, it is still soft and comfortable to carry. But the thing I love most about it is how vibrant the colour and design of my green and orange bag is! I get so many compliments on it, and the design makes me very happy to look at every time I use it. I would highly recommend this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bag-great-cause">Great Bag + Great Cause!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lunch tote is one of my favorite Amazon purchases yet! It&rsquo;s very durable and stays dry all day even if something leaks inside a bit, and there is plenty of room inside to fit 1-2 small or medium Gladware containers, and a small bottled drink. I love the design and the colors of the bag, the picture really does not do it justice.I recommend this tote to anyone who loves elephants as much as I do - the cause behind it is just as wonderful as the bag itself!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bag-bigger-than-most-you-find-at-store">Great bag - bigger than most you find at store</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These bags have great patterns, stay up and open on their own, have thicker neoprene than the ones I saw at the store, go through the washing machine just fine, and are easy for kids to carry. Also, they are bigger than many of the neoprene bags I saw at the store and I never have trouble fitting a big lunch into these bags. We bought two patterns. The first one we have had for about 6 months (every day use) and it&rsquo;s still looking brand new and sturdy. We could not be happier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-lunchbox">Love this lunchbox</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this every day for about 6 months and have even thrown it in my washer a few times, and its held up great. I would not be surprised if it lasted me until the end of dental school ( about 2 more years). It still looks brand new and I&rsquo;m looking into buying some of the reusable food pouches to cut down on my use of plastic from this company. I get so many compliments on the design as well. So glad I purchased this, and would rebuy, but the quality is there so I probably don&rsquo;t have to :D</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-lunchbox">I love this lunchbox</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this lunchbox, and so do all my friends that ever saw it. It&rsquo;s not very big, but I can pack medium size box, plus some snacks, fruit etc. I do not always have enough room left for a drink. Still love it though! Great, soft fabric, good zipper. I got the elephant design, and it looks great, just like the photo.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-to-have-an-attractive-bag-that-is-easy-to">Nice to have an attractive bag that is easy to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made and spacious. Nice to have an attractive bag that is easy to use. The fact that it&rsquo;s neoprene, it gives some insulation but more flexible than the padded insulated bag. So if you need it to keep cool for a long time - this is not the right fit. If you need something more flexible (and pretty pattern) then these neoprene bags are great! And some minor spills were mostly contained by the bag too.</p>

<h5 id="nothing">Nothing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>its A Christmas gift so if you want to keep being so pushy I won’t review it at all</p>
