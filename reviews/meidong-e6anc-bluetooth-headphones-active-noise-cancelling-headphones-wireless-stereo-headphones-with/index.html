<h5 id="very-pleased-buy-excellent-quality-and-reasonable-price">Very pleased buy, excellent quality and reasonable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pleased buy, excellent quality and reasonable price. Meidong E6 Active Noise Cancelling headphone is easy to pairing, just push the On/Off button on the headphones. It started flashing Blue&hellip; ok, worked on my galaxy phone to pair&hellip; connected.Good customer service: I tried this headphone at first, no found noise cancelling at all? I was angry and wrote to the seller where they hide my noise cancelling function! My friends! The Awesome thing is, the seller sent me an email reminding me that I needed to press on/off button twice to switch on/off the noise cancelling function. It is not only a noise cancelling headphones but also a Bluetooth headphones&hellip; talk about customer service!! Sound: Great! Now, I don&rsquo;t own a set of Bose, Beats, etc etc. I have kids. Things get broken. I don&rsquo;t own expensive items like that. Compared to the Sony set I have and also the skull candy my daughter has.. these are fantastic! better than the Sony, even a bit better than the Skull candy.. probably because they really shut out the outside noises! (Which, come on, is Imperative when you have small children constantly yelling &ldquo;Mom! Mom! Mooooooooooom!&ldquo; As another reviewer states, yes, the bass does go down when you turn on the noise cancellation switch&hellip; however the background noise also goes down! I could barely hear my dishwasher anymore. But either way, I could always hear my audio clearly, it blessedly shut out the kid&rsquo;s noise, and others in the house couldn&rsquo;t hear what I was listening too either- the sound didn&rsquo;t leak out&hellip; which is good.. when you&rsquo;re listening to old school rap, or romance books.These were so comfortable and sound-deafening, my husband wore them in bed for a whole day when he got a massive migraine. They helped block all the noise of 2 small kids screaming in the house and were comfortable to sleep with on! That&rsquo;s says a lot!! Wear-ability: I wore these listening to an audiobook for 3-4 hours before going to bed. I have yet to &ldquo;wear them down.&rdquo; I plugged in a few different times at night.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="they-are-excellent-headphones">They are excellent headphones.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These headphones are the best product that I have ever used.Their black metal shell look particularly cool, the appearance is simple not cumbersome. It is also very simple to use, whether it is to adjust the volume, or adjust the track.The ear part is very comfortable, unlike the modern day ear buds which can irritate your ear and keep falling out. They sit perfectly on my head, don&rsquo;t strain my neck, cushion and hug my ears, and the twist feature helps remove them quickly without damaging them.I also recently used them while listening to music on a flight and found when I turn on the noise-canceling feature I can hear the music a lot better. The noise cancelling feature is controlled by a button that can be turned on even if the headphones are not plugged into a device, so the noise cancelling works even if you don&rsquo;t want to plug the headphones into anything.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-headphones-with-a-decent-price-quality-and-battery-life-are-amazing">The best headphones with a decent price, quality and battery life are amazing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>1.Appearance - I like general design, and it looks like high quality and robust - <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>52</sub>.Sound quality - sound is excellent with noise canceling, bass is excellent, with noise canceling it&rsquo;s little bit more shallow, with so much bass - <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>53</sub>.noise cancelling function - The noise cancelling is good. It blocks out most of the noise on the Underground and almost all noise in my office. I am a frequent flyer and the noise cancelling is so effective that I wear the E6 for the duration of every flight - even when I am not listening to anything - because I am a light sleeper and they eliminate the engine noise.-<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>54</sub>. battery life - good enough , I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to drain it full - <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>55</sub>. comfort - you can adjust it to you head size, and I used them for few hours without any problem, they are very comfortable - 5/5addition:I have to say that support from meidong is excellent, my first pair had problems wit power switch not working properly, and I got new pair from meidong which is working as promised. Great customer support, meidong.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-these-headphones">I love these headphones!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love these headphonesMy first impression on these headphones is that the construction material is metal for the most part which I think actually helps to make these headphones extremely lightweight, works great for me.- noise cancelling works great.- Ease of connecting to multiple bluetooth devices is simple and takes seconds.- Good for calls, recipients would hear me well. As a matter of fact, people would hear me better and louder than other headphones i owned before.I have tried these out at home and in a busy office, plane and the isolation the ANC in these headphones offers is brilliant.Home - comfortThese headphones are very comfortable. - The soft faux leather padding on the headband and the memory-protein ear cups is very soft. I think I&rsquo;d be able to wear these for hours on end with no discomfort. I often use this traveling time for getting work done on my laptop and I like listening to music when I do this as it helps me to concentrate.Plane - silenceThe E6 headphones successfully blocked most of the engine and cabin noises without giving me a headache,I often use this traveling time.Overall, Amazing sound quality. Quite light on your ears. Battery lasts 8 hours (I think) and the noise reduction is pretty good. How well does it work? My girlfriend was waiting outside my door for 10 minutes because I did not hear her knock!!READ MORE</p>
