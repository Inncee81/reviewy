<h5 id="good-reliable-gigibit-ethernet-switch">Good, Reliable Gigibit Ethernet Switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have three of these switches in service in a very heavy internet traffic household. Multiple PCs, laptops, smartphones, consoles, media and game streaming boxes, etc running at once. I bought these instead of the trendnet I reviewed previously, as the trendnet stripped some important features from their 8 port switch; namely wall mounting holes and different lights indicating 100 or 1000 mbps connections. This netgear switch has both features, and a lifetime warranty to boot. For those reasons, along with the fact that it was currently on sale, I decided to invest in them.Performance has been flawless for anything connected to them. No stuttering, freezes or disconnects. There&rsquo;s really not much else to say regarding performance. It&rsquo;s been perfect for the year I&rsquo;ve had them.Regarding the capacitor issue mentioned in a previous review, you need not worry. These switches no longer use capacitors, or at least the ones that were the problem area in previous revisions of the internal hardware. I uploaded a pic displaying this.</p>

<h5 id="2016-best-home-office-network-switch">2016 Best home office network switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a few exchanges, I’ve finally found the best home office network switch and I’m excited to share my findings: The NETGEAR ProSAFE GS108E 8-Port Gigabit Web Managed Switch and here’s why.8-Ports: Spend the extra cost and reserve it for the future, you may not have use for the extra ports now, but you will eventually. I ended up buying two of these GS108E’s and already found use connecting additional devices (wired is always better than WiFi).Build Quality: The fact that this is fanless and energy efficient (max &lt;4.08W + auto power-down) is huge in my books, not to mention the sleek compact metal case for desktop or wall mounting. I found both TP-link and Linksys to be quite annoying with their power supplies – both brands seem to be using a low quality plug that emits an extremely high pitch noise.Price: The Unmanaged NETGEAR ProSAFE GS108 8-port kicks off at $44.21 ($34 after current rebate), which is an absolute deal compared to the GS105 5-port ($42) and the “low quality” TP-link 8-port ($24). Remember, you get what you pay for! The Managed GS108 8-port (from the intro) starts at $52.26 ($37.26 after current rebate) is a no brainer for the extra “$13&rsquo; from TP-link, and for an extra “$3&rsquo; to get managed is a great deal. The managed is nice to have for future use, but the unmanaged is still sufficient.Web Managed: The GS108E Plus (managed) has a very simple and easy to use web interface. Not that I’m using any of the managed functions / controls just yet, but it again will be reserved in the future for i.e. setting priority on ports for home TVs, VoIP; rate limiting; vlan; etc..See my full review @ [&hellip;]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had Netgear stuff (routers, switches, hubs) for more years than I care to share, and I&rsquo;m always impressed with both the build and functionality. For example&rdquo;- All-metal case design. Nope, no plastic junk here!- True &ldquo;shielded&rdquo; connections. Sure, you many not need shielded connections, but for those that do, it&rsquo;s there.- A very-common 12volt DC adapter. Oops! Did you loose the original? No problem&hellip;just find another 12v .5amp tip-positive adapter&hellip;all set.Though expressed tongue-in-cheek, these things are almost bullet-proof (not really referring to being shot with a bullet).It works&hellip;it works good&hellip;it does what it says&hellip;and it doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be something it&rsquo;s not. That makes it a very smart purchase in my opinion!</p>

<h5 id="unreliable-dropped-connections-constantly">Unreliable, dropped connections constantly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After using a GS108Tv2 switch for several years, I thought the GS116E would be a useful upgrade when I added a new Synology DS1515+ to my LAN. Alas, the unit I received was completely unreliable. The most significant example was dropping connectivity to equipment after several hours of operation &ndash; whether the equipment was a computer or a NAS device, the device wouldn&rsquo;t show up on a network scan if it was connected to the GS116E. The only way to regain connectivity was to unplug the respective ethernet cables and reconnect them. Before manually unplugging the ethernet cables, the respective GS116E ports would show activity through their LEDs, but trying to actually connect to the equipment was an exercise in futility. Pings would fail, logins would fail. After reconnecting the respective ethernet cables, however, connectivity would be restored. I upgraded the firmware, replaced cables, etc. The same equipment and cables that worked without error on the GS108T would periodically disappear when connected to the GS116E.Overall, I am very disappointed in the GS116E. I returned it and ordered another GS108T.</p>

<h5 id="truly-simple-to-operate">Truly Simple to Operate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you can plug an Ethernet cable into a port, you&rsquo;ll be able to install and get this switch working.After years of running everything off of a WIFI signal, I decided to swap as many devices to be hard wired to the network. If you are transferring big data (music, videos, photos&hellip; etc.) to your devices, do yourself a favor and do it over a cable if you can. Data over a cable is going to be much faster. If you are dealing with big files, this can have a big impact on your ability to do so without waiting for things to buffer.My list for things to switch to wired from WIFI included:3 PCs/Laptops, 2 TVs, 1 PS4, 1 XBOX 360. Simple math shows that to be seven devices. The problem was that my new router only has four network jacks.The solution is this switch. Connect it to one of the jacks on the router, and the capacity for wired devices just increased significantly.I went with the NETGEAR brand, as I&rsquo;ve installed several previous versions around our offices years ago, and they keep on going without any trouble for several years now.</p>

<h5 id="bug-in-1-4-0-2-latest-firmware-port-1">Bug in 1.4.0.2 - Latest Firmware - Port 1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT UPGRADE TO 1.4.0.2 IF YOU NEED GIGABIT PORTS. 1.3.0.3 is the latest stable version. Port 1 is capped at 100Mbps and fails connectivity tests after upgrading the firmware to 1.4.0.2. I had to downgrade the firmware to resolve the issue. I spoke with support and it is a known issue but the firmware is still available on the website.</p>
