<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="improved-build-great-toothbrush-no-buzzing">Improved build, great toothbrush, no buzzing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>According to specs, all Sonicare toothbrushes are essentially the same - they all vibrate at the same speed (31,000 strokes per minute) and can all use the wide range of available brush heads (except for the older Essence line). That is to say, they are all incredible at cleaning your teeth and if you&rsquo;ve never used one, you are in for a real treat. The difference between models is sometimes negligible, and often more than a little vague - all the bells and whistles are of dubious value. Often, the simpler the toothbrush is, the better it is - there&rsquo;s less buttons to break and less to pay for.In practice however, there are some features that may be worth paying for, but it really depends on your needs and the openness of your pocketbook. I have been through several Sonicare brushes, and the model I was using prior to this one is the 2 Series, pretty much the barest-bone model there is. I really like it, but I prefer this new HealthyWhite Plus (AKA Series 5) - not because of the buttons or features, but because I think it is actually built better. Moving to the Series 2 from the model I had before, I had noticed (as had many other people) that the brush had a loud rattle (or buzzing) when it wasn&rsquo;t in your mouth. It was a little distracting, but I honestly thought it had to do more with the brush head than the handle. However, I immediately noticed with this new brush that the buzz is almost gone - and if you look at the photo I&rsquo;ve attached you can see that the brush head sits significantly closer to the top of the handle than on the Series 2. I tried them both with a variety of brush heads, and always got the same result: the new model is much quieter. It&rsquo;s nice, but I really don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s worth twice the price.This model has a few superior features as well. It has a &ldquo;Quad-pacer&rdquo; which alerts you every 30 seconds to change to another area of your mouth. All the brushes have a 2-minute timer, and you can definitely do without the 30-second alerts, but it is nice just to note the passing time. It also uses a Lithium battery instead of the NiMH battery, which gives it three weeks between charges instead of two. Obviously that&rsquo;s better, but honestly, going two weeks is fine. This model also has three power levels and a whitening mode. Whitening is really just an extra 15-seconds of brushing that get tacked onto the end of the 2 minutes, and unless you have sensitive gums, you will probably never use the lower power settings. Philips touts this as &ldquo;6 different modes&rdquo; which is a really just the math of 3 power levels x 2 cleaning modes, and it&rsquo;s really nothing to write home about.I really like the new Diamond Clean brush head that is included with this set - but you can put any head on you like. The charger and travel case are the standard-issue Sonicare accessories and will also work with most other Sonicare brushes.Really, it&rsquo;s the better build that has locked this in as my daily toothbrush, but if I had to pay (I was provided both these brushes free for review purposes) I don&rsquo;t know if I wouldn&rsquo;t rather pay $30-$50 for the more basic model.</p>

<h5 id="the-feeling-of-just-hygienist-cleaned-every-day">The Feeling of &ldquo;Just Hygienist Cleaned&rdquo; Every Day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After approximately five years the battery died on my Sonicare toothbrush. Definitely an emergency situation if there is only one in the house, but fortunately I was able to use my husband&rsquo;s for the two days it took for this new one to arrive. The difference between the way your teeth feel using a standard toothbrush and a Sonicare is like night and day. Back in the days before I owned a Sonicare I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get to my 6 months dental appointments so that my teeth would feel smooth and clean again, even though I was totally dedicated to keeping my teeth brushed and flossed. With my Sonicare my teeth feel hygienist cleaned every day, and when I leave the Dentist&rsquo;s my teeth feel the same as when I walked in. At the Dentist&rsquo;s I am referred to as &ldquo;a boring six monther&rdquo; as I present no challenge to the hygienist. Amazingly, they have told me that their job gets a little boring without a challenge here and there. Glad it isn&rsquo;t me providing it!This new brush performs perfectly like the old one and I am very pleased with it. I didn&rsquo;t weight it, but I think it may be a little lighter than the old model which is nice. I still love the 2 minute brush cycle that turns the brush off automatically so I don&rsquo;t have to think about whether I&rsquo;ve brushed long enough. Another feature I like is the small size of the brush head so that reaching behind teeth is simple and effortless. Now that I think of it, that is a good word for the entire experience of brushing my teeth with a Sonicare, &ldquo;effortless&rdquo;.I looked into some of the less expensive models before purchasing, but read that they make more noise and vibrate a lot more in your hand which I realized I can attest to as we use one on the boat. If you have been sitting on the fence and never tried a Sonicare it is worth every penny in my mind to keep your teeth feeling and looking to perfection every day of the year.</p>

<h5 id="best-for-teeth-and-wax">Best for teeth and wax</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had the E series Sonicare back in the day. It lasted at least 5 years. This one is just as effective, if not better. If it last longer than the last one, then it is a better toothbrush. I still have the old one but have to charge it way more often. I would add, that if you are on a tight budget, do not hesitate getting a cheaper version. From what I know now, I would have gone down that road. Just try to get one with a lithium ion battery, if they all don&rsquo;t already have one.Using my toothbrush is a little more difficult but not a game changer. My wrist has limited mobility, and I have accustomed to it. Things can move a little more freely in my hand and this is where the most problem I have with the toothbrush. It has more than one button, which every once in awhile one gets pushed. One is the on off, intensity, and the length of time you want your brush on. Again, I like the brush, but I like the round handles on the old one better.The Sonicare tooth brushes are outstanding when you are trying to remove car wax from cracks and crevices from your car. Especially, days after when it hardens. I&rsquo;m sure there will be others finding equivalent ways of use, other than teeth. Bleach makes the bristles fall out&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-i-ve-been-very-pleased-with-it-so-far">and I&rsquo;ve been very pleased with it so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, and I&rsquo;ve been very pleased with it so far. I finally replaced my first one after about 12 years, so I definitely wanted to give this brand another try.I like that the replaceable head has fewer moving parts than my old model and that the base is more compact than before. The price is a bit steep, but I didn&rsquo;t mind paying it considering how long the last one lasted.</p>
