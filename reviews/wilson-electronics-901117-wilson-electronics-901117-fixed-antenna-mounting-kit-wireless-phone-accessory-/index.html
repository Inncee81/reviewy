<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="can-t-handle-high-wind">Can&rsquo;t handle high wind</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This just isn&rsquo;t strong or sturdy enough to handle high wind (50mph) when holding Wilson Electronics 700-2700 MHz Wide Band Directional Antenna with N Female Connector - Retail Packaging - White - the base of the mount just isn&rsquo;t large enough and it can&rsquo;t grip the pole strongly enough with the single band. I ended up turning to a Antennas Direct 20-Inch Antenna J-Mount which has a much larger mounting plate and grips the pole much more solidly. I do think if you had two of these gripping a single mast a few inches apart that it would be a reasonable solution, but not one alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-the-right-size">Just the right size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only about 10 inches long but more than enough for a Wilson antenna. Light weight but also strong enough.Mounting plate has five screw holes; more than enough for the weight and wind shear applied to the antenna.Some advice: download a signal tower locator (you will need to check SEVERAL - most are worthless) or buy a signal meter (not recommended for one time usage). Take measurements from several locations/directions around your location to find the best location to mount the antenna. Also check heights. A few inches (or feet) can make a very big difference getting you over interference you may not see (10 feet higher took us from 1 line to 3 lines without the booster. We live in a hilly, rural area and can&rsquo;t even see the tower. Remember, p*ss poor planning makes for p*ss poor performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-way-to-use-this-with-a-weboost-directional-antenna-without-modification">No way to use this with a WeBoost directional antenna without modification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was hoping that this would be an easy solution for installing a WeBoost directional antenna on the ladder of my motorhome. It required a lot of tinkering. First, there was no easy way to connect the antenna to it. I ended up turning it upside down and connecting the antenna to the aluminum Z-bracket. Then, I connected a 2-foot-long piece of 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; ID ABS pipe to the top of the RV ladder with two U-brackets.. The pipe part of the bracket shown in the illustration fits into the ABS pipe. I can rotate the antenna to face the closest cell tower. It works, but I think Wilson needs to do more work to figure out a better way to use their WeBoost with an RV. They provided suction cups to mount the WeBoost to a window, but quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t trust suction cups to hold an expensive piece of electronic equipment out in the weather.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-mount-screws-not-included">Awesome Mount; Screws Not Included!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This antenna mount is exactly what I needed to install my Weboost 4G-X antenna on my roof (after being told by a Wilson technician that I didn&rsquo;t need it). It is extremely easy to install and the bracket space required is small enough to fit on the bargeboard on my roof which is only about 3 inches tall. The pole, though only twenty inches, is hollow and extremely lightweight but very strong. I would suggest mounting the antenna as low as possible on the pole to avoid any sway, though, even maxed out, there is not much sway, but there is some. If you have a heavier antenna, then you may need a stronger mount, because as it is, there will be some shaking in your mount, even though the amount I have in mine is quite small.I had tried to mount the antenna using the HDTV Antenna Mount - 20in, but the bracket was too large to fit on my bargeboard.My only complaint with the antenna is that screws are NOT included even though it clearly states:&ldquo;Includes All Hardware Needed to Mount Wilson Outdoor Cellular Antenna On Home Or Office - Wall Mount Bracket,10&rdquo;L X 1.5&rdquo; Dia Aluminum Pole &amp; U-Bracket Assembly&rdquo; I went to Ace Hardware and picked up 5 stainless steel screws for about $3.00.I hope you find this review helpful, and if you have any questions, just ask in the comments and I&rsquo;ll try and respond promptly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-could-probably-fabricate-a-more-useful-antenna-mount-yourself-but-in-the-meantime-this-will-have-to-do">You could probably fabricate a more useful antenna mount yourself but in the meantime this will have to do.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this antenna &ldquo;pole&rdquo; to support the external component of the Wilson Cell Phone Signal booster. It consists of a U-bolt and clamp, a mounting bracket, and a short piece of pipe. You can see them in the picture. I would have like it better had the pipe been longer, say, four or five feet instead of the approximately 16 inches it is. This unit is not going to raise a cell phone signal antenna very far. What would have made me even happier would be for the external antenna to actually have a receptacle into which the &ldquo;pole&rdquo; could be fitted. I have yet to figure out how to affix the cell phone antenna to this unit and have it stay. Duct tape, maybe? The mounting bracket is constructed of aluminum. A heavier gauge aluminum or even steel would have been better material selections. And the bracket could have been longer, long enough to extend beyond the eave of the house.</p>

<h5 id="not-really-meant-for-a-heavy-antenna-but-is-hold-up-fine-in-the-wind-and-weather-for-my-purpose">Not really meant for a heavy antenna but is hold up fine in the wind and weather for my purpose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Prefect of when you need to mount a flight aware antenna and need a little stand off from the side of a house or building. Not really meant for a heavy antenna but is hold up fine in the wind and weather for my purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-paddle-style-antennas">Perfect for Paddle-Style Antennas</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If this mounting kit is used for mounting paddle-style cell booster antennas, it works great. Its simple, inexpensive, and easy to mount. As others have noted, l suppose it may not work well for other types of applications if it is subject to extremely high winds. These paddle-style cellular booster antennas have a wide signal path, up to 45 degrees, so if your antenna is pointed directly at the cell tower, a slight amount of movement should not affect the signal at all. If you are using a yagi antenna or another style of antenna that requires precise alignment then I can see how this mount could be problematic but only in very windy areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-crazy-about-it">Not crazy about it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a remote mtn cabin in N. Ga. Before installing the repeater, we would get one, sometimes 2 dots on our Iphones. After installing I get 2 and 3 if I am right by the indoor broadcast antennae. That is not really what was promised. It is better, I am keeping the rather expensive piece of equipment, but it is certainly not what I had hoped, nor what was implied by the manufacturer (I don&rsquo;t believe they make any express promises nor gaurantees), or the product reviews. They themselves, when I called for some support said RG11 coax should be used, yet they package RG6 with the product. I might recommend someone else try one of the other manufacturers and see if they get a better result.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-stuff">Good stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked as advertised. I had no problems with using the product and it seems to be very solidly made. I would refer to a friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>everything you need to set up an outdoor antenna</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to use this due to the location. However, the assembly is easy to use and would perform well in the correct conditions.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was as specified</p>
