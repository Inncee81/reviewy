XZ-1 DIGITAL CAMERA BLK - product specs to follow via CD. What&rsquo;s in the Box : Strap, Lens cap and Lens cap strap, LI-lithium ion battery, F-2AC USB-AC, Adapter, USB cable, AV cable, Olympus Setup CD-ROM.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Unleash your creative side with the first-ever Olympus X Series camera. Designed for those who want the quality of an SLR in a high-end point-and-shoot format, this camera provides a new, easy-to-use outlet for artistic expression. With the XZ-1 you&rsquo;ll capture high-quality still images and HD videos in any shooting environment thanks to its fast, super-bright, built-in Olympus iZuiko lens and its large, super-sensitive CCD sensor.</p>

<p>Olympus XZ-1 Highlights</p>

<p>Fast, super-bright f1.8 iZuiko 4x wide lens
The iZuiko f1.8-2.5 6.0-24mm (28-112mm equivalent angle of view in 35mm cameras) digital lens is a newly-developed 4x compact version of the legendary, high-quality ZUIKO Digital lenses featured with Olympus DSLRs. With a minimum aperture of f1.8 at wide-angle and a maximum aperture of f2.5 at telephoto, this lens assures fast shutter speeds for sharp low-light images. This aperture range also allows photographers to take portraits that highlight the subject by defocusing the background, a capability not possible in most compact cameras. The lens is specifically designed for clear, high-quality photographic performance with minimal ghosting or flare.</p>

<p>High-sensitivity CCD
Compared to existing <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.33-inch, 14-megapixel CCDs, the light-reception area of each pixel of the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.63-inch, 10-megapixel CCD featured in the XZ-1 has been doubled. Superb, low-noise images can be shot even in dimly lit situations such as night scenes and indoor shots.</p>

<p>Advanced manual controls
The XZ-1 offers advanced manual controls that experienced photographers expect from larger digital SLR cameras. But, with the XZ-1, advanced features are easy to use. A control ring around the front of the lens and the wheel controller on the back provide immediate access to the most important manual settings like ISO, aperture and shutter speed to make it easy to adjust the camera on the move.</p>

<p>New, 3-inch OLED monitor
Whether composing still images or HD videos, photographers will appreciate the XZ-1&rsquo;s sharp 3.0-inch OLED monitor to frame and show off still images and High Definition (HD) movies in detailed 720p. The LCD displays 610,000 dots in vivid color, reproduces colors and shades more accurately with deeper black tones, and consumes less power. The monitor also provides a wide viewing angle ensuring that images can be composed from even the most obscure angles.</p>

<p>Low-light performance
The XZ-1 has an easily accessible built-in pop-up flash to illuminate low-light subjects, reduce red-eye and fill in dark areas. The camera also features an AF illuminator to make it simple to focus in low-light situations. Additionally, Dual Image Stabilization further assures you&rsquo;ll get the shot you want while holding the camera: Mechanical Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization compensates for camera movement in low-light conditions when shutter speeds are slower while Digital Image Stabilization freezes the action with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds that prevent blurry images often caused by a moving subject. On top of all this, the XZ-1 also offers a Low-Light mode which automatically adjusts the ISO sensitivity up to ISO 3200 to take sharp full-resolution photos in dark places.</p>

<p>HD movie with HDMI control
Shooting video is as easy as ever with the new Olympus XZ-1 camera. The camera captures all the action in crisp 720p HD video at 30 frames-per-second. The XZ-1&rsquo;s easy-to-reach record button on the back of the camera body makes recording videos a breeze. If you&rsquo;re about to snap a photo and you realize a video would capture the spirit of the scene even better, simply press the record button and instantly you&rsquo;re capturing videos! The XZ-1 makes sharing your content easier than ever. Just connect it to your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable and use your HDTV&rsquo;s remote to control playback functions and navigate the camera&rsquo;s menus from the comfort of your couch.</p>

<p>TruePic V Image Processor
The XZ-1 pairs a high sensitivity 10 megapixel CCD sensor with the TruePic V Image Processor to produce clear and colorful photos using all the pixel information from each image to provide the best digital images possible. The image processor is noted for accurate natural color, true-to-life flesh tones, brilliant blue skies and precise tonal expression; it also lowers image noise in photos shot at higher ISO settings (ISO 100 to ISO 3200), enabling great results in low-light situations.</p>

<p>Hot shoe and accessory port
To expand the camera&rsquo;s versatility, the XZ-1 includes an accessory port that is compatible with select PEN camera accessories. Photographers can attach optional accessories like the SEMA-1 external microphone adapter, the VF-2 electronic viewfinder, or the newly introduced MAL-1 macro light. These optional accessories easily slide into the camera&rsquo;s accessory port and hot shoe.</p>

<p>Additional Features</p>

<p>10-megapixel resolution
The 10 million pixels in the high-resolution CCD create superior image quality. Create poster-sized prints without losing a single detail.</p>

<p>Large, high-sensitivity CCD
Providing the best image quality ever in a compact Olympus camera, the large <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.63-inch CCD enables greater dynamic range and smoother gradations from highlights to shadows.</p>

<p>4x iZuiko zoom lens
Based on the standards of Olympus DSLR lenses, the wide aperture of the iZuiko f1.8-2.5 allows a rich and vibrant range of photographic expression. It allows faster shutter speeds in low light&ndash;and it allows for a shallower depth of field than most compact point-and-shoot cameras.</p>

<p>HD movie 720p
A simple, one-touch button allows you to record movies with amazing clarity in high-definition, right from your camera.</p>

<p>Accessory port
The XZ-1 includes a port for accessories including the SEMA-1 Microphone adapter set and the VF-2 live-finder, a detachable electronic viewfinder. The viewfinder easily slides onto the camera&rsquo;s accessory port and hot shoe to provide 1.15x magnification for a 100% field of view. The VF-2 rotates up 90 degrees which is useful when shooting subjects from challenging angles. The external accessory port also allows for connection with the SEMA-1 external microphone adapter set for enhanced audio capture.</p>

<p>In-camera Art Filters for movies and still images
With six in-camera Art Filters (Pop Art, Soft Focus, Grainy Film, Pin Hole, Diorama and Dramatic Tone) you can explore your artistic side while taking both still shots and HD video. The Art Filters can be applied as you shoot, no additional software required.</p>

<p>Dual Image Stabilization
Dual Image Stabilization combines Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds to capture crisp, clear images in any situation.</p>

<p>New, easy-to-use Live Guide control
Seeing the results before you shoot can change the way you take a picture. Want more vivid or muted color in your shot? Want warmer or cooler hues? Want a brighter or darker subject, or a sharper or softer background? Or maybe you want to capture the fast-moving action of your subject with a little artistic blur, or perhaps freeze the action? Simply set the camera to iAuto, press OK to engage Live Guide, then press the up and down arrows on the back of the E-PL1 to easily slide through numerous photographic effects. Make adjustments and watch the LCD as the effects are made live &ndash; before the image is captured! Live Guide also features a Tips section on how to compose a shot or shoot kids, pets, flowers and more.</p>

<p>In-camera PANORAMAv
Captures three images and stitches them together to create one amazing panoramic picture by simply pressing the shutter button and slowly panning across a panoramic scene.</p>

<p>AF Live View with AF Tracking
AF Live View works as seamlessly as a point-and-shoot to display subjects, in focus, on the LCD the instant the shutter is pressed half way. AF Tracking locks your subject into focus right on the LCD, and constantly adjusts focus and brightness whether you or your subject is moving. With this mode, a simple push of the AF button and shutter release enables you to keep fast-moving and unpredictable subjects in focus.</p>

<p>Advanced Face Detection
Face Detection automatically focuses on your subjects&rsquo; faces and optimizes exposure for sharp, brilliant portrait pictures.</p>

<p>TruePic V Image Processor
In addition to more detail, the image sensor, combined with the next-generation TruePic V Image Processor, delivers excellent dynamic range, accurate color fidelity and reduced noise, all the way up to 3200 ISO.</p>

<p>Underwater Housing (optional accessory)
The XZ-1&rsquo;s compact design makes it the perfect companion for all of your dive trips. The PT-050 underwater case has been customized for the XZ-1 and is waterproof to a depth of 40 meters (approximately 130 feet). With its durable, high-quality polycarbonate construction, this Olympus housing protects the camera from water while also cushioning it from knocks and bumps on land.</p>

<h5 id="xz-1-wins-out">XZ-1 Wins Out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my preliminary review for the Olympus XZ-1, which arrived at my house this afternoon. I will update as necessary.Over the last two weeks, I have ordered, and returned, two other cameras: the Fujifilm HS20EXR, and the Panasonic LX5. Neither one of them really satisfied me in terms of a total package. The build quality (at least on my copy) of the HS20 was suspect, and worried me a bit. The RAW processing time was quite slow, and I guess I just didn&rsquo;t like the overall feel of it. The Panasonic, despite all the rave reviews, did not satisfy in terms of IQ. Color blotching crept in far too early (even as early as ISO 200) for my taste, and by ISO 400 it was unbearable. The Jpeg processing on the LX5 wasn&rsquo;t great, either. So I finally decided to order the Olympus after much reading and staring at sample images on the internet, though I was becoming skeptical it would be able to satisfy me. At least so far, I was wrong.The Olympus XZ-1 is a marvel of technology. From the blazing fast Zuiko lens to the quick and slick menu interface, to the conservative beauty of the design, this camera means business. Shooting with the XZ-1 is an effortless joy, and it works so well and so intuitively at times that you almost forget you&rsquo;re using a camera at all. I&rsquo;ve read in other reviews that the rear control ring is finicky and annoying, but that is not my experience. I find it to work quite well, with the right amount of tactile feedback. The same is true of the front ring around the lens, used to control various settings based on the mode you are in. Sure, there&rsquo;s not a dedicated button for ISO, but it&rsquo;s so easy to set the ISO from the menu that I&rsquo;m not quite sure what the issue is. The lack of an AFL/AEL button is a bit of a letdown, but I don&rsquo;t find it to be a dealbreaker by any means.The art filters range from quaint novelty effects that I will rarely use to things like the Dynamic Tone filter, which (though the effect is a bit hit or miss) can be incredibly striking.As far as all the other modes go, it&rsquo;s pretty much your standard fare, with the addition of the &lsquo;low light&rsquo; mode. But I wouldn&rsquo;t go too crazy with that mode, as the noise at higher ISOs from the XZ-1 is pretty pronounced. And that leads me to image quality.For some reason, though the XZ-1 possesses quite a large sensor for a point-and-shoot, it produces quite a lot of noise. What this creates is the necessity to find the right balance with your RAW processing between noise reduction and image clarity and sharpness. Or, you can just use the Jpegs, which I must say, are very well processed, but when put up against the RAW files, can&rsquo;t compare to the detail, due to the noise reduction applied to the Jpegs. This is the one bit of a bummer about the image quality of this camera. You will see a decent amount of noise as low as ISO 400, though nothing that can&rsquo;t be dealt with in post until you pass 800. 1600 might be salvageable, but it&rsquo;s questionable. The nice thing is that the noise is more luminance than color oriented, because I find it&rsquo;s more difficult (as with the LX5) to deal with large blotches of inappropriate color. So, bad news dealt with. And it&rsquo;s really not that bad, because guess what? You&rsquo;ve got one of the fastest lenses in a compact camera at your command. This means that you will rarely need to jump above ISO 800 to shoot just about anything. The speed of this lens is simply a marvel to behold, and a joy to employ. Not only does it allow you much, much more freedom in ALL your shooting (aperture only hits 2.5 at telephoto, which is still faster than most dslr lenses are at wide!), but the size of the sensor in relation to the aperture capability of the lens also allows for some of the nicest bokeh you&rsquo;ll find in a compact. Olympus also smartly employs an in-camera ND filter to help you keep those aperture numbers low whilst shooting in bright daylight, which is a godsend.And despite what I&rsquo;ve said about the noise issue, the images from this camera are, in general, pretty spectacular. This is no dslr, but the images are about as close as you&rsquo;ll get without buying one at this point. While the noise reduction applied to the jpegs definitely reduces fine details, they still look spectacular. The colors from this camera absolutely scream, and even if you&rsquo;re not fond of the detail loss in jpeg, just go for RAW shooting, which is still really, really fast. Shot to shot times are very fast, seemingly regardless of the file type (though I am using a very fast Sandisk card as well).The continuous shooting speed of this camera isn&rsquo;t wonderful, but honestly, it&rsquo;s not bad when you consider that you can fire off quite a few pics (even with the images set at Fine Jpeg + RAW) before it gets stumped. You can also reduce the quality of the Jpegs to 5MP to grab some more fps, and even down to 2MP to grab even more fps, but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t go that low.Autofocus is generally good, though I did encounter some questionable choices when in macro mode that did annoy me a bit. However, you can choose between 11 different focus points to get the pic you want, or hold the shutter button down halfway and recompose. In general though, I found the autofocus to be reasonably fast and accurate thus far.One other caveat is that for some reason the Auto WB seems to have trouble with incandescent lighting, creating overly warm tones and forcing you to manual select the incandescent setting for accurate colors. This is not a huge deal, but it&rsquo;s a bit of an annoyance.The LCD screen is gorgeous, and while I wish the camera came with an EVF, Olympus has given us the ability to add the VF-2 viewfinder, which is both a great and, unfortunately, incredibly expensive option. I will be ordering the viewfinder, though I don&rsquo;t relish spending half the price of the camera on a tiny little accessory.I look forward to many glorious outings with the XZ-1, and can honestly say that I highly recommend it to anyone looking to move up from a simple point and shoot, but not yet ready to go full on with a dslr and a bunch of lenses.(UPDATE 1) Received my VF2 viewfinder today, and was able to try it out for a few hours before work. WOW. Talk about a quality product. I was concerned about the cost (and really I still am), but you definitely get a great little add-on. The picture is ultra clear and makes all other EVFs tremble before it. Obviously using it in daylight is great, but for me, coming from a dslr background, just having it was a no-brainer. And if I decide at some point to upgrade to the EPL2, I don&rsquo;t have to buy it again. So that made it worth it to me. Still loving the camera (even more with the viewfinder)!(UPDATE 2) Man, I LOVE this camera. The VF2 viewfinder has increased my enjoyment of it by quite a lot, and I honestly didn&rsquo;t think that was possible. I could sit and nit-pick the image quality compared to dslr cameras, but it&rsquo;s just not worth it. Upping the sharpness and contrast applied to the jpegs makes them usable straight out of the camera, as long as you keep the ISO reasonable (800 or lower). Flipping the &lsquo;gradation&rsquo; feature to auto can garner you better dynamic range in shadows as well as better detail, though you will experience more shadow noise, so use it wisely.I certainly didn&rsquo;t buy this camera for the art filters, just thought they&rsquo;d be a fun little addition&hellip; but they really do help me with my creative picture taking, and get me thinking about things from a different perspective. Highlights are the Grainy B&amp;W (allows for some interesting videos as well), Diorama!(I&rsquo;ve come to LOVE this one), and of course the popular Dramatic Tone. Soft Focus is useful as well for portraiture or weddings. The super fast lens allows me to shoot at ISO100-200 most of the time, occasionally venturing to 400 and, much more rarely, to 800. Also, make yourself take pics using the Monochrome setting. Turn up the sharpness to +1 and the contrast to +2, and behold the beautiful B&amp;W photos this camera spits out. Pretty awesome.Also great is the Macro and Super Macro. I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of the tracking AF though, a sports camera this is not, though the continuous shot is pretty decent in the right situations. Good for kids and such, but really fast movers like dogs can sometimes be problematic. Pretty much forget birds, but the range of this lens doesn&rsquo;t really allow for that anyway.The bundled software is actually not bad either. I&rsquo;m used to using PSE, so I use that for most everything, but I do a simple distortion correction in the Viewer 2 software first, which works quite well (the lens has some decent barrel at wide, and a little pincushion at tele, nothing really problematic).All in all I can&rsquo;t say enough about this camera. If you&rsquo;re on the fence, just buy it. You can return it if you don&rsquo;t like it, but why would you do that? Kudos, Olympus!</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I were tired of carrying all the DSLR gear with us whenever we go somewhere, so we started looking for a lighter alternative. After reading some reviews and comparisons online (dpreview.com is a great source for that) we decided to buy Olympus XZ-1.Pros:- It has a bright f/1.8 lens which is pretty good at low-light situations (or just taking shallow pictures)- The screen has live view where you can see the depth of field in Aperture mode before taking the photo- OLED screen is bright enough to see in day light. It also isn&rsquo;t that power-hungry.- The big sensor can capture the subject in great details.- Anti-shake mechanism works pretty well. I tested <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>, even 1 second exposures which turned out better than I expected. With my DLSR&rsquo;s anti-shake off, those pics would be more blurry.- Charges through USB (this may be a con for you if you use card readers) simply keep your camera plugged in to your computer after transferring the images, and you don&rsquo;t have to take out the battery for charging anymore.- The dial around the lens is easy to use. Depending on the mode it changes aperture, shutter, scene mode; or rotates images.- 6 Art filters which applies digital effect to your photo/movie in realtime.- 18 Scene modes which will make taking any occasion easy. For example, &ldquo;pet&rdquo; will track the moving animal in the frame. Or &ldquo;panorama&rdquo; scene mode will help you take 3 consecutive images and stitch them together auto-magically.- Macro mode can focus even at the closest distance possible (be careful, your lens may be easily touching that flower!)- It fits in a pocket (maybe not jeans or shirt pockets)- (ADDED) Built-in ND filter lets you have longer exposures (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> seconds, for example) during day time. See the waterfall picture as an example.- (ADDED) Splash-proof. Used under heavy rain where water drops were all over the place (lens, dials, screen) with no problems.Cons:- Art and Scene modes are on the top dial along with P/A/S/M modes, so you cannot combine those (e.g. cannot apply an art filter while in Aperture Priority. But I guess some of those filters are meant to overwrite aperture/shutter)- Shutter lag is definitely noticeable if you are a DSLR user. If the timing is important, try sequential mode. Luckily there is even a hi-speed burst shooting mode.- The lens is too bright sometimes. Shutter speed cannot go faster than 1/2000s. In a bright day light at f/1.8, you&rsquo;ll start seeing overexposure and fringing. EDIT: With the built-in Natural Density Filter on, this is not the case anymore!- Some of the art filters need more processing power than others, which makes the screen (live view) refresh slower. For taking photos this is not a big deal. But if you record a movie that way, you will get lower frame rates. But again, this camera is not meant to replace your camcorder or your post processing software.- No viewfinder.- (ADDED) Lens cap is pretty lose. We ended up buying an after-market cap that fits around the lens (you can see the threads if you look carefully) with spring-powered blades that will automatically open/close when lens is in/out. Edit: Looks like they have an official lens cap now Olympus LC-63A Lens Cap for XZ-1 Digital Camera- (ADDED) RAW version of the photo looks pretty dull comparing to JPEG. We had hard time editing the RAW to match the colors to the JPEG. It would have been nice if some color profile was provided with the camera.11/12/2012&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Camera is still working great. Bought a Sony RX-100, but it cannot just replace the XZ-1 yet. XZ-1 has great support (Olympus has released firmware v1.5 as of May 2012), and its low-light performance is among the best in P&amp;S class. Recent price drop ($199) brings this camera to a greater price/performance point.Couple months ago purchased an LCD remote, which works perfect in test environment but I couldn&rsquo;t test its durability in real world yet LCD Timer Remote TC-UC1 For Olympus XZ-1, E series. This is one of the 3 necessary accessories, other 2 being LC-63A Lens Cap, and a Gorillapod. Olympus LC-63A Lens Cap for XZ-1 Digital Camera &mdash;- Joby GP1-A1EN GorillaPod Flexible Tripod (Grey and Black)</p>
