<h5 id="another-fine-product-from-ram-mount">Another fine product from Ram Mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ram Mount products have been making my life easier since I first discovered their products almost fifteen years ago when I needed a solution to securely mount a GPS in a light twin-engine airplane that would not send it flying when the weather got a little (or a lot) rough. This Double Socket Swivel Arm is another fine example of the quality that Ram is known for. I chose this attachment to hold my phone in my vehicle, as well as to provide a better view angle than the standard 3&rdquo; arm was giving me. It locks down tight and holds my heavy phone in place so I can view GPS information en route. Can&rsquo;t say enough about Ram Mount products, except thank you for making such great products!!Not really a disclaimer: I purchased this item with my own hard-earned money and have no affiliation with the Ram Mount company. Also because I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to get free stuff to review like all of the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; reviewers on Amazon. But I don&rsquo;t care, because Ram Mounts are AWESOME! Cheers!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-the-perfect-ram-mount-like-i-am-used-too">Not The Perfect Ram Mount Like I am Used Too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Ram Mount doesn&rsquo;t quite reach the perfect rating of all my other Ram products. This mount remains a bit &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; even when tightened beyond &ldquo;too tight&rdquo; So my Go Pro camera shakes a little when driving down the road.Not bad, but not perfect!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ram mounts are super versatile and this double swivel just adds to that degree of versatility.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-to-use-with-a-motorcycle">Perfect to use with a motorcycle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product to use with a motorcycle. I used the U-Bolt mounting base to attach it to the handle bars. This allows me to have it hide under the windscreen and able to move it out of the way to get to my key. The only reason that I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it is kind of bulky.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-my-application-with-modification">Works for my Application, with Modification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the Ram Mount devices I have previously purchased were aluminum, but this one is PLASTIC. The ball clamping arms at each end DO NOT have the normal spring loading as do all other arms I have purchased.The clamping arms at both ends are indexed at the middle connector, with a male eight sided configuration on the middle connector matching a female eight sided configuration, four on each side, of each arm. Slightly loosening the tightening knob of the arm does not allow turning a device attached to the arm. The tightening knob must be dramatically loosened in order to turn the arm, with the possibility of losing the device attached with a ball mount to that arm, like a video camera.My intent was to use this swivel arm to hold a video camera on a motorcycle handlebar with the capability of loosening the top knob just enough to turn the camera to either side, up to 90 degrees, but the octagonal indexing of the arm connector prevents that turning, without the possible loss of the camera at the ball connecting top of the arm.Turning the male, eight sided connector on a lathe to remove the corners of the eight sides into a perfect circle allowed the top arm to be turned with only a slight loosening of the knob, without any possibility of losing the attached device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointing-not-stable-not-to-ram-mount-standards">Very disappointing, not stable, not to RAM Mount standards</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my RAM Mount with the all-metal, normal arm, which is highly stable and works great. This swivel arm is nowhere near the quality and performance of the normal arm. I wanted a longer arm with more bending options, so bought this product. It is not stable, not steady, shakes a lot, and despite appearing to be highly adjustable, it actually offers a limited number of rotational positions to choose from. This is made from plastic, not all-metal like the normal arms, and between the plastic construction and the the five joints/connection points in this design (yes, five from ball to ball), it just cannot hold a standard size phone stably at a 6&rdquo; distance from the suction cup, particularly not for video recording while driving (such as with the Harry&rsquo;s Lap Timer app.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-re-wondering-if-you-should-yes-buy-the-ram-mount-and-accessories">If you&rsquo;re wondering if you should - yes - buy the Ram Mount and accessories.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a great product. Definitely 5 stars for build quality. I purchased two other mounts before I went with Ram because I didn&rsquo;t want to spend that much on a Ram mount. Well guess what? Both of those mounts broke! I could have saved my money for the Ram and I wouldn&rsquo;t have been out the other $50 I spent on broken product.This thing is pretty much indestructible.A few things to remember:1. This is just a piece that you need. You&rsquo;ll need the other pieces to actually have a mount.2. This is going to add vibration to your phone. Period. It is going to vibrate more with this longer heavier attachment.3. This does not &ldquo;rotate any way you want it.&rdquo; I know that it looks like it does - but it is hard to explain. It is very functional and you can get your phone in just about any position - but it is not completely, &ldquo;move it however you want.&ldquo;If I had to do it all over again knowing what I know now - I would still purchase this accessory for my Ram Mount.Oh - and PS- I am not one of those people that get compensated to give 5 star reviews for free product. I wish I knew how to break into that game. Alas - I had to pay full price for mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="multiple-usage-tool">Multiple Usage Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great addition to the RAM Mounting systems I already have on my motorbike. I only wish I had ordered this particular accessory earlier. The versatility of this is going to make fitting my GPS in a better viewing location without blocking my instrument panel or requiring me to take my eyes off the road.The only reason for not 5-stars, is that it is a tad longer than I was expecting; however, I am very happy with this purchase and I know it is going to be a great addition to my current RAM collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cant-make-up-your-mind-where-you-want-it">Cant make up your mind where you want it?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to get my phone in a specific position over the fairing on my Harley so I can video and it does that perfectly BUT its a little wiggly for video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>always good . Ram!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-as-good-as-it-gets">It&rsquo;s as good as it gets</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to increase the options for mounting my GoPro. It&rsquo;s as good as it gets. Very adjustable and extremely steady when properly tightened.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="varied-angles-with-no-disappointments">Varied angles with no disappointments.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Durable and flexible with multiple angles and attachment options.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Fantastic</p>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>extends things out to far and the adjustments compete for the same space</p>

<h5 id="a-good-solution-for-the-unusual-fit">A good solution for the unusual fit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little over complex, but once it&rsquo;s set, the fit is rock-solid.This arm is useful for those difficult and/or unusual fits to get the iPad in the perfect place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-own-many-ram-mount-products-4-cars-with">I own many RAM Mount products, 4 cars with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own many RAM Mount products, 4 cars with kits, 2 bikes and 1 desktop holder where I work. This swivel is well made and durable, however, i deducted 1 star for the fact that&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-ram-quality">Not Ram quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly the very same experience as other buyers have posted: it&rsquo;s not possible to tighten down the sections enough to remove the inherent wobble.</p>

<h5 id="put-your-phone-where-you-want">Put your phone where you want.</h5>
