<h5 id="perfect-choice-for-my-needs-amazing-package">Perfect choice for my needs, amazing package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like 99% of people reading these reviews you are considering this vs. the Phantom 3 Professional. Honestly ask yourself what are you going to do with this anyway? If you are looking at it as a toy, these are not toys.I read reviews for months, watched about a hundred YouTube videos, and put my money down here. I am a photographer and I will tell you why for me this is the right choice, and maybe not the same choice for you. I am no fanboy- I could have gone with the Phantom 3 just as easy if it met my needs.1. This is a complete package, and it&rsquo;s put together well as a package. The included case beautiful. Two included batteries, big selling point. Two sets of rotors nice touch. The transmitter which already has the tablet like screen built in, major difference between the Phantom. I have an iPad so I could have easily gone Phantom. The included steady-cam grip, how cool is that! And it all packs up in that case. Sure the interior is styrofoam so what. I must have received the newest model as my styrofoam inner was grey, not white like I have seen previously, and also mine came with two BLACK batteries not white as shown in photos. Very nice package.2. I could have had this out of the box and charged and been flying in an hour. But I took my time and went through everything before even thinking about it. Again this is no toy. Charged the transmitter and battery, installed battery, and calibrated the gimbal and compass. Installed the SanDisk 64GB Extreme card I purchased to go with it. Checked all the settings- camera was defaulted to record 1080p which is fine- I don&rsquo;t have anything to watch 4K video on anyway.3. Up and flying literally within 5 minutes of going outside and powering on. Even in a 5mph wind and my first time flying (in the turtle mode), was up in the air. Easy and I mean easy to fly and rock solid stable hover even in wind. Took it up to 300 feet and just flew around shooting video to see how it performs. Landing rock stable very easy to fly.4. Put the memory card into the Mac, the video is absolutely beautiful and crisp. It&rsquo;s actually stunning how good it looks. Pictures came out equally sharp.So again what will you use this for? For me I will use this at relatively close range to shoot events and couples. For me, the adjustability of the speed is a plus. I want it to move in predictable ways and I&rsquo;m not looking to run races with it. It is quiet, large, and easy to get the kinds of shots I will take with it. The other features such as look at me and follow me are great, just not what I purchased this for. You shouldn&rsquo;t be flying drones like this out of sight range anyway- so for people that want to bag on the wifi connectivity of the FPV screen for &ldquo;only&rdquo; going so many feet, you are likely the people I see in all of these Phantom videos going into the water or running into a tree. I don&rsquo;t need automated way-point flights where I can no longer see the bird in the air. I want to fly this myself and not rely on automation. Not once did my signal drop off or did I lose connectivity, didn&rsquo;t have an app crash, or have to purchase a new phone or iPad to make this work.Dollar for dollar- this package for my needs wins hands down. I have not had to use Yuneec customer service yet so I can&rsquo;t chime in on the Yuneec vs DJI service comparison. I can say I did explore the parts available to repair the Q500 myself something you can&rsquo;t easily do with a Phantom, and replacement parts for the Q500 are very inexpensive and readily available.Very happy with this purchase, and amazing how much fun this was to fly!* 1/13/2016 Update: When putting back in the case after my second flight, noticed a smudge on the camera filter. Took off the filter and tried to clean with a Nikon lens wipe- would not come clean, must be something in the coating of the lens. Emailed Yuneec customer service, got a personal reply back within 24 hours and they UPS me new part on the way. Very satisfied with the service, love the quadcopter.Also purchased this and makes all the difference flying at night in the dark:Safety Bike Light Set by Classic Glow - LED Bicycle Lights - Durable Aluminum LED Lights - Features 2 Front &amp; 2 Rear Ultrabright Lights - Fits Bikes, Bicycle Helmets &amp; Backpacks - Easy InstallationLED bike lights that I mounted on the quadcopter legs, with the white lights facing forward and the red rear. This way I can set the front lights to be solid on, and the rear lights to flash so that when I fly at night I know orientation wise what direction the drone is facing when it is up in the air. Works great and looks amazing- like you have searchlights mounted on the front- and with the lights mounted on the legs still fits in the factory case with the lights mounted, very cool.</p>

<h5 id="but-the-phantom-has-much-better-fpv-range">But the Phantom has much better fpv range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the q500 40, but from my local shop rather than Amazon. This is my second quad, the 350 QX3 being my first. The q500 flies slower, but is a much more stable platform. While it flies up to 15mph with GPS enabled, if you turn gps off it speeds up dramatically. Do a YouTube search, some have gotten it up to 35+ mph. I am too cautious to fly with GPS though. This is not a small unit, so remember that before purchasing. In comparison to the Phantom 3, it flies smoother and quieter than the Phantom. But the Phantom has much better fpv range. And the camera on the Phantom 3 professional is a tad better, but not by much. However, the customer service by Yuneec is far superior to that of DJI. That ultimately made me choose the q500. I usually keep my quads in sight range so going out more than a mile or so is not something that matters to me. Overall I&rsquo;m pleased with my purchase, and I forgot to mention that having two batteries come with it is a blessing. That alone is a win. The quads with their limited flight time need to all have two batteries standard issue. And the charger comes with a cigarette lighter adapter so you can charge on the car with no more money out of pocket. Little stuff like that adds up so it&rsquo;s something to consider.</p>

<h5 id="this-drone-is-amazing-so-easy-to-fly-absolutely-flawless-and-the-pictures">This drone is amazing so easy to fly absolutely flawless and the pictures &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This drone is amazing so easy to fly absolutely flawless and the pictures you capture and video is awesome so vivid in color. so many features with the new Q500 4K Battery life is a good 20 to 25 mins and the distance i got was 1,900 ft which i no longer saw it after 800 so whats the purpose of flying if you cant see it. So with that just hit my home home feature and it return to home and landed 20 feet from me . Also had a question about certain function. So i called and waited just 2 mins on the phone got a few question answered but also needed tech support left a message got a emailed that day saying they recieved my message and will call and also email. Got a call the next day and i missed it the tech at yuneec left a message saying he will call back which he did the next day.</p>
