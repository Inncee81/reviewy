<h5 id="best-pair-i-have-ever-owned-don-t-second-guess-it-buy-it">Best pair I have ever owned! Don&rsquo;t second guess it! BUY IT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was skeptical on buying these due to how cheap they were, and former experiences with lower priced Bluetooth headsets in the past! I&rsquo;m so glad I gave it a chance because it is the most comfortable pair I have ever owned! I can barley feel it in my ear! I can&rsquo;t make it fall out after i put it in even when I try! Great for runners, or just anyone that likes buds that don&rsquo;t fall out and fit perfect! The noise cancelling is incredible! I can&rsquo;t hear anything but my music even in the loudest environments! The quality, in my opinion, is up there with beats. Very crisp sound and if you like bass it also handles all you can throw at it and has a very unique sound for the bass. I love it! Can listen to anything from talks or speeches to Dubstep and everything in between sounds like they were made to be played on these ear buds! Have recommended to all my friends! With the 3 different sized ear pieces, I haven&rsquo;t been able to find one person that it doesn&rsquo;t fit perfectly with one of the options! Will be my go to company for all my Bluetooth/sound needs in the future!</p>

<p>Before I ordered these, I had just returned Monster&rsquo;s Power Beats 2 Bluetooth earphones. They didn&rsquo;t fit well to get a good seal, unnecessary emphasis was put on lower frequencies, and of course they&rsquo;re expensive.I was looking to buy the Phaiser Bluetooth earphones but then saw their prices go past $60 as I was about to buy them.TaoTronics took the cake in the end coming in at under $30, and I think my search for workout earphones has ended for now.1) Fit: They come with both ear loop and buds, supplied in three sizes. The large size fit in my ears instantaneously. They seem secure for a reasonably high intensity workout.2) Build: Solid construction and the cord length is just right whether I wear it behind my head or not. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like here is that while the volume and middle buttons are spaced apart, they feel the same to touch. I&rsquo;d have liked some way to feel the difference.3) Operation: Everything is just like any other Bluetooth earphones, which is good. I didn&rsquo;t like that the center button (multi function) can&rsquo;t skip songs. The volume buttons do, by holding them a bit longer. Not a deal breaker, but will take some getting used to.4) Sound quality: Lastly, this is where these truly shine. I shuffled through many songs I usually try my headphones and earphones with. While any Bluetooth earphones or headphones inherently induce a very slight loss in sound reproduction, rest assured. You will be blown away by the sound. For many years, I kept using a pair of on-ear Bluetooth headphones by Nakamichi (I know!) in the gym, and I absolutely love the sound they reproduced. TaoTronics in-ear Bluetooth headphones have successfully managed to edge them out in this department.I am overall pleasantly surprised and I highly recommend these. Even if you consider yourself as an audiophile, I think you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.And no, I haven&rsquo;t been given these for free to leave a positive review. I wish I knew how to get free stuff like that!</p>

<h5 id="tao-tronics-vs-jaybird-x2-vs-phaiser-bhs-730-love-my-tt-s">Tao Tronics vs Jaybird X2 vs Phaiser BHS-730. Love my TT&rsquo;s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>*This is a review of the Tao Tronics Bluetooth earbuds. It includes comparisons to the Jaybird x2 and Phaiser BHS-730.Conclusion: For those of you who don&rsquo;t want to read the entire review, I am putting this first so you can see my results. I wasn&rsquo;t impressed with the Phaisers. Just the sound quality was enough to send them back, but I am a little picky on sound. Both the Jaybird X2 and the Tao Tronics (upgraded version) sound good, fit well, are of good build and have similar sound quality with the X2&rsquo;s having perhaps a little better sound quality, but only marginally so. I ended up sending back the Jaybirds and the Phaisers and kept the TT&rsquo;s. Very happy with the purchase. Would give 5 stars if the sound were excellent, but the sound is only very good. Definitely would purchase these again and won&rsquo;t be going back to the Jaybirds unless the newer versions offer something unique and better.A little about me. I am not being paid to write this and paid Amazon prices ($31) for the earbuds. I have installed home theaters and worked in the sound industry for awhile. That being said, everyone hears subjectively, so this is just my opinion, though I do think I have a good grasp on sound quality. I spent 3 weeks last year comparing full sized headphones and that was also very educational (if you are looking for full size, my winner was the Audio Technica m150. Amazing). My own personal purchasing habits are that I would rather pay more money for a quality product if it seemed worth it, but I don&rsquo;t care about name brands unless the product is also good. Now to the review&hellip;I have been using an earlier version of Jaybirds which I bought about a year and a half ago for around $100. I was very happy with them but had a few complaints, those being the fins that are supposed to keep the buds held in your ear never worked well for me, the bluetooth would cut out occasionally while at the gym and I had to push the ear buds in a little ever now and them to keep them tight in my ears. But with all that, I was still fairly satisfied. Sound quality was very good. They took a trip through the washer and stopped working, so I began the hunt for the replacement. I welcomed a chance to try the X2&rsquo;s which were only $80 and seemed like a steal. However, being curious and wanting the best, I saw the reviews on the Tao Tronics ($31) and Phaiser ($35-39) were good, so I ordered all three. I love comparisons. Here is what I found&hellip;Packaging: Who really cares as long as they show up unbroken, but, the Jaybirds win out here. Very nice, thick box and lots of wrapping, which also proved to make them the most difficult to extract. The Tao Tronics (TT&rsquo;s) were also nice, cool box, etc. Phaiser was just kind of blah. But again, who cares? Winner: JaybirdDesign: All three use the basic 3 button control. All worked fine. The Jaybirds and the TT&rsquo;s were of the best design, perhaps the Jaybirds a bit more, but barely if so. The Phaisers again were just meh. Not bad, but not great. All were good enough. I didn&rsquo;t see any design flaws in any of them. Winner: Jaybird and TT&rsquo;s tieFeatures and accessories: All have similar features but the TT&rsquo;s and Phaisers have magnetic backs which the Jaybirds have. I thought this was a nice feature because using my old Jaybirds I often had them around my neck and have had them slide off at times. My old Jaybirds had a great flip open hard case which I loved. The new ones have opted for a plastic hard case which you have to fingernail to get open. They went backwards in my opinion on the case. The Phaisers had the best case. easy to open, looks nice and hard enough to keep your buds safe. The TT&rsquo;s have a bag. That&rsquo;s all. Not elegant and not protective, but I have my old Jaybird case to use and my buds are safely in there now. All are sweatproof and the Phaisers and Jaybirds have great warranties against sweat, though I don&rsquo;t sweat hard enough to ruin my buds, so not a big issue for me. All come with plenty of ear hole options to ensure the proper fit.Winner: TieSome rambling now. Out of the box both the TT&rsquo;s and Phaisers were charged and ready to go. I had to charge the Jaybirds for 3-4 hours to get a full charge. While I was waiting for that I started my comparison of the TT&rsquo;s and Phaisers. First off, the Phaisers are big. My Jaybirds are fairly large and it didn&rsquo;t bother me, but after comparison, I realize this is a bad thing. When you are running or moving, the extra bulk coming out of my ear caused the buds to shift and start to slip out, if even just a little, but that does affect sound and noise isolation. I measured how far each bud stuck out of my ear and here is what I found. Phaisers- 18mm, X2&rsquo;s 17mm, TT&rsquo;s 10mm. So you can see that the TT&rsquo;s are very compact compared to the others. I connected my buds easily with bluetooth and started the dual test. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to decide the Phaisers were not for me. The sound quality was poor. They were okay for a cheaper pair of buds, but at $10 less, the TT&rsquo;s were superior. That was the end of the Phaisers. All other things aside, I wanted good sound and the Phaisers just didn&rsquo;t cut it. Return number one ready to go back to Amazon.Charged up the Jaybirds and was so excited. Turned them on, connected easily and the sound was very good. Probably the same as my old Jaybirds but since they went deep six, I couldn&rsquo;t do a side by side. But good sound, for sure. So excited. Put back on the TT&rsquo;s, same songs (hip hop, EDM, rap, Adelle and some other vocal songs and some classic rock) back and forth, listening to nuances, bass, clarity etc. Back to the head to head.Sound: The Jaybirds for me had the better sound, but marginally. Some songs sounded better on the TT&rsquo;s, but overall, the Jaybirds sounded the best. Good bass, clear, no issues. I was using my Samsung Galaxy 6 which has equalizer settings. The Jaybirds sounded best with automatic equalization ( chooses the best based on the music) while the TT&rsquo;s sounded great without any equalization. With equalization, the TT&rsquo;s had too much bass at times and the mids and highs muddied a bit, but minimally. They both sound great. I think the TT&rsquo;s are prone to be a bit bass heavy, so if you like bass, they would be a great choice. But for balance, the X2&rsquo;s win.Winner: Jaybirds, but barelyBlueTooth: This was an amazing test to me. I tested through walls and distance. Around the house the Jaybirds had the better connectivity, which surprised me considering the X2&rsquo;s are BlueTooth 2.1 or so while the TT&rsquo;s are the 4.1 and should be superior. Both cut out through multiple walls even and a moderate range. I next took them both outside and walked away from my phone until I begin to hear choppiness, lost signal, and eventually full out loss of all sound. The TT&rsquo;s started to chop around 50 ft and lost signal at 80ft. Not bad. The Jaybirds chopped around 100 feet and went all the way to 200 feet before losing signal. AMAZING. I have to say I was leaning towards the X2&rsquo;s and this point with their better sound and amazing distance.Winner: JaybirdPractical use: The last part of my test was taking them both to the gym. I had been using my old Jaybirds there for awhile and only had the occasional loss of signal, or rather some chop in the sound and was just used to that. When I am behind a double wall and people walk between the signal is when the loss of signal seems to occur. Par for the course. I leave my phone on the counter and work out without a phone in my pocket. With this test at the gym, both performed well. The TT&rsquo;s had only one small moment of chop, but not as bad as my old Jaybirds. What I started to realize with these buds was that the TT&rsquo;s seemed lighter, stayed in my ears a lot better and were more comfortable. The sound transference through the cord (cord rub) seemed less with the TT&rsquo;s as well. The ear fins on the Jaybirds just don&rsquo;t work as well for me. They keep the buds in but also cause the buds to pull out of my ear a little. So for running on the road, when I want a little less sound isolation so I can hear cars and such, the X2&rsquo;s would be fine using the fins. But at the gym, using the fins cause more sound to filter in and and also reduce the sound quality. A good fit is needed for good sound quality. Back to the size. The X2&rsquo;s had the same problem as my old ones. I can&rsquo;t use the fins and get good sound, so I just put them in my ears without fins. I have good ears for fitting and almost all buds can fit nicely in my ear. When I was jogging, I had to readjust the X2&rsquo;s several times, but he TT&rsquo;s stayed in place well and felt much more comfortable and lighter. Calls taken on both were similar. People didn&rsquo;t complain about either.Winner: TT&rsquo;sSo you have read my conclusion at the first of this review and know I kept the TT&rsquo;s. I am a little picky and I am truly impressed with these buds. I was expecting the Jaybirds to win and was a little biased, but even with the lower distance for bluetooth, the TT&rsquo;s have enough range for what I use them for, are light, sound great and have a superb value. I don&rsquo;t think the minimal sound quality justifies the extra money for the Jaybirds and some songs actually sounded better on the TT&rsquo;s. Take my word, the TT&rsquo;s will make you smile.</p>
