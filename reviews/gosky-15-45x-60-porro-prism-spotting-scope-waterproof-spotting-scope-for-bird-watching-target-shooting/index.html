<h5 id="one-of-the-lenses-this-would-have-been-a-great-scope-returning-and-reordering-another-to-see-if">&hellip; one of the lenses this would have been a great scope. Returning and reordering another to see if &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the defect/bubble in one of the lenses this would have been a great scope. Returning and reordering another to see if it has the same problem.This is a great company and really cares about satisfying their customers. They responded back to my review above the same day that I wrote it offering me a heavy duty table top tripod for my inconvenience (which by the way is outstanding). The lenses on the replacement scope are perfect and it&rsquo;s really a great scope.</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-easy-to-use-and-plenty-of-magnification">Sturdy, easy to use, and plenty of magnification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great scope. Getting the cell phone pictures is tricky in bright light. Almost need a hood to see images because of phone lack of visibility in sunlight, but I am learning the tricks. Scope is very sturdy. Have not been able to use highest magnification so far. Lowest is great for most of our backyard viewing. Will take it to the great outdoors and try 45X.</p>

<p> I got this scope to watch and take video of the birds and squirrels that I feed in my backyard. I chose this Gosky scope because it was priced less than other sellers. I have never used this type of scope so I am giving a newbie point of view.The Gosky scope has a hefty, solid feel to it and seems well built. It has a metal casing and the black area near the lens has a thick rubber-feeling, I think for better gripping.The scope comes with metal table-top tripod, two different phone adapters, two cleaning cloths, lens and eyepiece caps and a nylon carry caseThe eyepiece is removable so that you can attach one of the adapters to the main housing without the eyepiece and the other adapter can be put on directly on the eyepiece. The black part of lens you see in the pictures can be adjusted to slide forward. In the manual it states it is to protect the lens from rain and also to shade the lens from the sun (I&rsquo;m guessing from glare).Since this is the first time I have ever used a spotting scope I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with it. The reason for 4 stars is that I wish the instruction manual were more detailed. The manual does show how to attach the adapters and itdoes give you a QR code in the manual for more detailed instructions (of course I DIDN&rdquo;T use it). I&rsquo;m just used to the days when you actually got a REAL manual with anything you buy. Now everything is &ldquo;Google it&rdquo;. <em>rant is over</em>.I attached a pic of the specs, I have no idea what any of it means. But I thought it might come in handy for someone who does.Also attached are actual pics and video from my phone while I used the spotting scope (placed it on a chair instead of table while testing it out so the neighbors didn&rsquo;t think I was trying to spy on them). You have to have your phone camera lens as close as possible with the scope so that you have a &ldquo;circle&rdquo; (see pics) of your subject roughly lined up in the middle of you phone screen. Once you have that &ldquo;circle&rdquo; then just zoom with your smartphone camera and your whole screen will be filled. My phone case is not a very thick case, if you have a thick case you might get a better result without. I imagine also the better the phone camera the better the pics/video. I was testing the scope out on a rainy, cloudy day.All in all I really like this scope, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to use (once I actually read the instructions), feels solidly built and was priced less than others. Now I can watch that bratty squirrel better as he tries to steal all the bird food.Gosky 15-45X 60 Porro Prism Spotting Scope - Waterproof Spotting scope for Bird Watching Target Shooting Archery Scenery - with Tripod and Digiscoping Adapter - Get the World into Screen</p>

<p>Works on outside shooting range (75 yards) and inside shooting range (75 foots). I can see a target on 50 foots in the poorly lit shooting tunnel. Do not expect to see a target at close distance. I tried to mount iPhone 7, but do not use it on the range.</p>
