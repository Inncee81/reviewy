<h5 id="i-liked-the-camera-so-much-that-i-ordered-a-replacement">I liked the camera so much that I ordered a replacement &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The rear camera on my first unit died shortly after installation. I liked the camera so much that I ordered a replacement rather than just a return. Had it now for a couple of months and am very happy with it. Don&rsquo;t buy the 64G mini SD card recommended by Amazon like I did, the unit will only handle up to 32Gb of memory. The reason for only 4 stars is the back camera records backwards (video flipped backwards). You can change it for the Carsun display to show properly but when playing back on another device it&rsquo;s still backwards. I sent an email to the manufacturer to see if there was a firmware update that would fix this but never got a response.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="clear-dash-cam-video-with-lots-of-features">Clear dash cam video with lots of features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> To start off, the camera comes with 16GB. The camera records in pretty high quality, so this will only last you about 2-3 hours of driving. I recommend getting a 32GB or 64GB microSD card. They are cheap and it’ll be worth the additional piece of mind.I like that with the push of a single button the large screen becomes a “back-up / rear camera”. Super useful and clear, even in sun light. The date timestamp function works perfectly. Even with power removed, it remembers the date and time (Lots of cheap cameras reset every time the power disconnects. Seriously? This one works perfectly.)I particularly like the parking monitor and the motion detection. Parking monitoring makes the camera turn on if someone crashed into it while you were away. It records approximately 15 seconds. I wish it were longer, but again&hellip; you don’t want to record <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. That defeats the purpose of dash cams.The front camera quality is superb. Roadsigns are crystal clear. License plates of the cars in front are extremely clear as well. Rear camera is standard 720p camera, which provides “good enough” quality. You shouldn’t expect the rear camera to be 1080p since that would use up even a 32GB card within an hour.As I mentioned, the quality is very good; just take a look at my video!The manual isn&rsquo;t the best (Chinese translation), but the camera is really simple to use. You won&rsquo;t need the manual. Using the actual camera menus is more intuitive than reading the manual.Recommended. Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="i-m-smart-enough-to-figure-it-out-even-though-i-m-not">I&rsquo;m smart enough to figure it out even though I&rsquo;m NOT &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My biggest complaint is with the instruction manual! It needs to be re-translated into English! Luckily, I&rsquo;m smart enough to figure it out even though I&rsquo;m NOT &ldquo;techy&rdquo; by any stretch of the imagination! Camera is nice! Wide angle!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-for-a-cam-in-this-price-range">Very nice for a cam in this price range.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After testing and reviewing over 10 dash cams in various price ranges I have found one that kind of stands out in its league&hellip;or price range I should say. First off you get everything you need to get going except an SD card which you will have to buy. It does however support 64g and not just 32g like most cams. The user menu is super friendly to nav&hellip;I didnt bust out the directions once and had it set up in a few minutes. Running the wires to the rear cam however took some time. You will either have to pay someone to do it or be a DIY kind of person and figure it out. Attaching the rear cam was easy&hellip;just getting the wires inside your vehicle may not be for you so think about that before you do the install. PIP on the large 4&rdquo; screen I like that. I dont have to switch back and forth its always there. Most dash cams only record in front of you&hellip;what if you get rear ended? This will cover it. Nice sleek design yet large lens for the camera. That part is kind of squirrely for me but I got used to it. Most of the basics are here too&hellip;vibration detection for instant on&hellip;.if someone is messing about with your car it will record&hellip;if someone hits your car while your away it will record. MIND YOU it will only record the front and back. If someone knocks your car door at walmart it wont see them. You will have a nice dent and it will record the parked car in front of you. Hopefully you can catch them backing out maybe? Wires are plenty long enough. I had enough wire to run my rear cam on a Tahoe and some to spare. The picture quality is great. The pics I have uploaded arent that good&hellip;im sorry about that&hellip;my windows were a bit foggy that morning. Night vision is superior on this one, front and back. Overall I am quite happy with this unit and for the price it stands out among the others. 5 stars from me. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. Let&rsquo;s keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe &amp; Happy Shopping!!I received a sample product to test and evaluate and give my unbiased feedback to you. This is my honest opinion of the product. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like the picture quality, the playback is excellent; you even get quality sound- something i hadn&rsquo;t planned on, so if you&rsquo;re the type of person that that likes to sing or hum along- this will all be captured😁!You have to be somewhat of a detective to figure out all the annoying things you want to change- like press the first arrow button 2x to get the rearview pic off the screen while driving forward. I would pay something to get ahold of a user manual that could show all the options available! Lots of buttons but no clue what to do! I&rsquo;m the nervous type and don&rsquo;t feel brave enough to just punch away- hate to ruin it, or worse- pull up an option I hate!But it takes great pics, kind of nice to review where you&rsquo;ve been, what you&rsquo;ve done. Really great to prove a point to backseat drivers- one of those SEE I Did NOT CROSS THE LINE! This proves it once and for all time!I actually purchased this because of the crazy drivers on our street- now it will show up black and white-collar Really it&rsquo;ll be fullHD Color!Everyone should have this- it&rsquo;s just better&hellip; really!</p>
