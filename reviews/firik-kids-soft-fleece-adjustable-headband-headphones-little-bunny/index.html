<h5 id="cute-and-comfy-but-require-some-help-from-mommy">Cute and comfy, but require some help from mommy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Firik Kids Soft Fleece Bunny Adjustable Headband Headphones are super cute for any little girl. My daughter loved them instantly, though I do have some positives and negatives about them. One of the issues we have are the fact that they are a bit hard for my 4 year old to put on herself. She cant really get the velcro put on by herself and the earbuds adjusted to sit over her ears at the same time. I help her, but she seems to do better when she leaves the velcro connected and she can just slip them off her head and back on when she wants them. They are wired so you have to make sure your child knows that they cant get them wrapped up or pull on the plug, but the wires sit nicely on the front of her face and haven&rsquo;t given her much issue. They definitely are made for kids. I tried them on and they don&rsquo;t fit my adult head at all. They are adjustable though, and you can move the ear pieces inside the headband to where your child needs them to be. Also, you can remove the earbuds entirely so that you can throw the headband in the wash which I think is nice. They have an okay sound, not amazing but good enough for her, and they also have a volume adjustment button halfway down the wires so your child can easily turn things up and down. All in all a cute set, if you are looking for something cute and warm, and would definitely help keep a lil one warm in the winter while they play on any device.P.S.My daughter accidentally lefts hers on the floor and the puppy chewed it up. Dont make the same mistake!~Thanx~</p>

<h5 id="cute">Cute</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my daughter&rsquo;s Easter basket. I prefer her to wear headphones while on her iPad to give me some quiet time. The headphones are wired and not USB so you do have to plug it into the device. The headband is a soft fleece and there is velcro in the back to adjust the width. The ear buds are flat and go into the hollow part of the headband so you can adjust where they lay so you can align them with the location of your kids ears. I must say these are cuter in person.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is very cute! My kid loves this bunny design very much. The adjustable band makes it fit for both children and adult, which is pretty practical.The earphone speaker is within the bands, and just reach where the ear located. It feels more comfortable than the earbud since you have nothing actually in your ear. The sound quality is more than I expected, which can compete with the earphone come with the iPhone. It is very enjoyable for taking a short nap or just a quiet time before sleeping. I will recommend this product to my friends.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-daughter-with-hydrocephalus-vp-programmable-shunt">Perfect for my daughter with hydrocephalus/vp programmable shunt</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s shunt is programmed with magnets, so in the past we have has some horrible issues with ear buds being next to the shunt right behind her left ear. These are great! She has a larger head so since this band fits me, it will fit her as well, and I was able to slide out the right phone and insert it into the slit on the left side. This way she doesn&rsquo;t lose sound quality and I don&rsquo;t have to drive her to the neurosurgeon to get her shunt valve reprogrammed. This is a HUGE win for my 8 year old who hasn&rsquo;t known the luxery of using a headset like a &ldquo;regular kid.&rdquo; I am so happy to have purchased these! Wish there was a unicorn one <em>hint hint</em> the Velcro in the back that makes it adjustable is a nice feature as well.</p>

<h5 id="good-alternative-to-plastic-headphones">Good alternative to plastic headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these headphones to use with my (large headed) 8 month old son on a cross-country flight. I thought it would be great for him to be able to watch videos on the iPad if he got fussy. Unfortunately the headband was way too big; I think it would fit more like a 2 or 3 year old at a minimum. I think these headphones are a good idea and a great alternative to uncomfortable plastic headphones, but unfortunately I had to return them.</p>

<h5 id="very-soft-and-easy-to-adjust">Very soft and easy to adjust.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so soft and comfy! Didn&rsquo;t realize how soft and comfortable they would be until I got them in real life. They are way nicer quality than the photo shows. I bought the pink bunny. My little one just loves wearing them. The Velcro is really nice as well. Adjusts to your childs head size.The headphones are of really good quality. These make a great gift!</p>

<h5 id="cute-design-with-soft-comfy-material">cute design with soft comfy material</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very cute design with comfy soft material; I brought for my friend’s 6 years old daughter, she loved it!!!!! This gift totally got her attention and she was wearing it all day long.  I think it can also fit for adult, but design-wise, its for children. You can also wash it if it gets dirty. The wire is pretty flat so they aren’t bulky, it cover the whole ear and you can adjust the volume.I think it’s a great gift for children under 10 years old, it also come with 6 colors for girls and boys. The bunny design is really cute, the color is no difference than the pictures on the website.</p>

<h5 id="cute-headband-earphone-my-daughter-loves-it">Cute headband earphone! My daughter loves it!</h5>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-idea-but-really-poor-implementation">Good idea, but really poor implementation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are just a really bad design. There isn&rsquo;t much to keep the headphones from sliding around in the headband, the cord is really cheap (not braided) and what 2 or 3 year old&hellip;</p>
