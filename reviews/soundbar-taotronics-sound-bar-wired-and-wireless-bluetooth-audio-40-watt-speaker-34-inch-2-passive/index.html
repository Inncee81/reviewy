<h5 id="great-choice-for-a-sound-bar">great choice for a sound bar.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am genuinely impressed.We had a 5-speaker(w sub) thing that had gotten more and more difficult - almost think it was too complicated to ever get it to even sound &ldquo;ok&rdquo; -at any rate - on a whim I bought this speaker because the TV speakers just were awful.I cranked it all the way up - I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s 40Watts or not - but if we have to have it maxed out there is probably an issue with our hearing.It&rsquo;s a nice sounding, works perfectly with the optical cable hooked up - one tip - I have found if I use the optical hook up I can still use the TV sound also and no delay or weird echo.I love to make purchases on here after reading reviews - pulling the trigger - even for $80 - and then being completely happy with a purchase. Reviews are important and they impact my choices for sure.If you are looking for a solid sound bar - with well rounded sound and able to fill a room - then this is a good one. I am completely pleased with my choice and happy to share the experience.</p>

<p>Great quality speaker. It gets really loud without distortion. When you raise the volume with the remote, the LEDs in the front blink in ascending order to indicate the level of volume. Bluetooth works like a charm, and it pairs quickly and painlessly. This sound bar outperforms my $100 longer Vizio sound bar from Walmart (SB3820).</p>

<h5 id="the-taotronics-tv-sound-bar-experience-review">The Taotronics TV Sound Bar Experience Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:TaoTronics Sound Bar Bluetooth AudioI have taken some photos and done a video demo for anyone who is interested.Massive product packaging for a long, slender, quality 20W sound bar.The packaging was well thought out and professional. The appearance of the boxing on the outside is similar to what you’d find at a Fry’s or Best Buy Electronics Store in your area. It’s a sturdy cardboard that keeps the inside components well protected. Even further to that protection, inside, the sound bar is cushioned for shock absorption with foam inserts on the sides and center of the sound bar. So even with the evil delivery folks who may toss around a product or drop the box from standing position to your front door, you’ll be OK that the sound bar doesn’t get affected in any way in terms of damage. The sound bar is wrapped in a plastic bag to cover it from dust and there’s removal adhesives on the sides of the sound bar for covering up from scratches or dust.For this product, I went through the 8 page English section of the Multilanguage user manual to understand the contents and setup. The user manual confirms the design specs to validate what you receive as well.In looking at the package, I was happy to see a small remote with easy to understand buttons labelled to operate the sound bar. There’s also a provided RCA cable for those who have old television models to plug in as wel. But most modern televisions have optical inputs or coaxial. Unfortunately, Taotronics only provided in the package at the time the RCA cable. My TV used for demo had an optical input which is a better quality option and that along with the coaxial and AUX inputs were not provided cables for each in the package. I would like for them to provide these accessories in future model releases. Fortunately, I found an optical cable in my storage for use and it worked fine for this sound bar. You’ll need to remove the protective dust cap from that input to plug into the sound bar.In terms of looking around at the sound bar, it’s long, but it isn’t very wide, so it won’t take up a lot of space should you do what I do, which is leave it on top of a shelf space to not deal with mounting it on the wall and poking holes on your dry walls.It’s also lightweight. I can grip and hold from the center and lift up with one hand and I’m not a very strong guy. So this makes it easier to manage and transporting around.There’s a touch panel on the top of the sound bar that controls the power and volume control options if you’re not wanting to use the remote or if the remote battery gets low.The front panel of the sound bar has LED indicators to let you know when the sound bar is in a specific mode of operation, powered on, or on standby. When you control the volume, there’s an Audio LED indicator that flashes so that you know that it’s responsive and triggered a response. The downside that I had about the sound bar is that there’s not a visible volume meter to know how high you’ve cranked up the volume on the sound bar or if it’s reached the max output of volume. I suggest they include that somehow, possibly as a digital display.The backside of the sound bar has all the inputs and mounting sections that you’ll need to get this up and running. One side has the optical and coaxial inputs. The other side has the power plug in input.The bottom of the sound bar has nice and thick rubber stoppers to prevent the sound bar from sliding around easily if you put this on a flat smooth surface. There’s rectangular slices of rubber on both ends of the sound bar.For the sound quality, there weren’t any sports on at the moment to test the crowd noise perception and commentary with sound effects. But I had a DVD of a foreign concert and played it with this sound bar enabled while disabling my TV speaker. Turns out the music quality was great. Clear crisp audio. Bass levels noticeable. Social commentary and music during the listening and testing experience was what I expected for a TV sound bar. No hissing. Using the Taotronics remote, I was able to crank up the volume and sit at the dinner table to enjoy myself around my family watching some performances.Definitely an improvement in sound quality with this sound bar than without it. In fact, everyone needs a TV sound bar for the modern TV’s they buy because TV makers have slimed down the design of the TV and sacrificed audio quality by placing it on the backside where you rely on having the sound bounce against the wall to hear it back at you. Cranking up the TV volume controller used to be a real pain and not enjoyable to watch sports or TV shows. With this TV sound bar, there’s a much better experience with the sound projected towards the front of you like how old TV’s used to be.If there’s anything else to see improve for this sound bar, it’s to allow it to sync up with the TV when you power it ON and power it OFF. There is a standby power saving mode on the speakers, but if I turn on the TV 30 minutes later, the sound bar will not automatically come on to project out the audio. I’ll have to use the Taotronics remote to power on the sound bar which causes some delays and not a quick performance reaction to catch something on TV going on really quick.I hope this helps.</p>

<h5 id="truly-impressed-at-cost-vs-performance">Truly impressed at cost vs performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own several sound bars, pretty much have one in every room to add to the sound. In the sub $100 range you are often plagued by bars that scream &ldquo;power on&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo; &ldquo;optical&rdquo; and other modes when selected. This unit is not one of them, thank goodness. The sound quality is actually pretty good though I want to say I don&rsquo;t quite think the audiophile will want to run this without using an equalizer such as the one in google play music or in Kodi. I find the bass response is really good without distortion at high volume levels and the remote is simple enough any person can find it workable. For 34&rdquo; and great sound output this is a real deal in the sub $100 category.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This soundbar is awesome! We have a slightly older TV and the sound starts to crackle a little bit at higher volumes. This soundbar was a game changer. It obviously improved the sound quality tremendously and now we can actually watch movies and TV shows at full volume. It was super easy to install and comes with cords and a remote. It also doubles as a Bluetooth speaker that we can connect our iPhones to and play music. Overall, it&rsquo;s a really great product!</p>

<h5 id="nice-soundbar">Nice Soundbar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Soundbar is Good But Could use a few tweaks.The sound is good.The bar is nice. It looks cool.It comes with a remote and the power cable and HDMI cable.The remote takes 2 AAA batteries.The sound bar shuts off too soon and easily. It is a pain to turn it back on because it takes a little more time than I would like to turn on.Other than that I Like the soundbar so I think 4 stars is fair.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was wanting to get a sound bar for my tv in my gym. The speakers on my tv aren&rsquo;t loud enough while I&rsquo;m working out and I wanted sometime with more base. I bought this sound bar based on reviews and price and it&rsquo;s awesome. I&rsquo;m really happy with my purchase. The sound is amazing! It was also really easy to install. I had bought a sound bar bracket so I can hang it from my tv that&rsquo;s installed to the wall. I love how it looked all set up.</p>
