<blockquote>
<p>RAM-B-166-A-GOP1U: RAM Twist Lock Suction Cup Mount, Short Double Socket Arm &amp; 1&rdquo; Diameter Ball with Custom GoPro Hero AdapterThe RAM Mounts designed for the GoPro do not come with the GoPro thumbscrew or the stainless acorn nut as depicted in the photographs. Instead, they ship the GoPro adapter with a nylock nut, a tiny machine screw, and a washer expecting this to be used in lieu of the GoPro thumbscrew. One can easily re-use their thumbscrew, but the Acorn nuts have to be swapped over from leftover GoPro mounts or purchased, but they are not retained in the RAM GoPro adapters! This allows the nuts to be easily lost.The rubber balls on the RAM mounts combined with the stout center assembly are the biggest selling points of the RAM mounts. It puts the other brands to shame! However, I am not a big fan of the sheet metal screws used to attach the ball assembly to the base. I could understand if it was lean manufacturing to reduce the number of specialized adapters, but almost all of the RAM mounts use the ball assembly. It would have been more secure and practical to produce an integrated ball assembly for each of the bases. That way I could still swap between mounts but bypass the need for the 2 sheet metal screws that could strip out the plastic or fail over time.I would have liked to see the ball assembly integrated into the suction cup mount. I also would have liked to see the thumbscrew included, or at least provide an acorn nut or nylock nut that is retained in the plastic GoPro adapter. This way the end user can simply reuse the GoPro thumbscrew without digging around for extra nuts. The machine screw included with the RAM mount is a smaller diameter that isn&rsquo;t as secure as the GoPro screw, and as a result the included nylock nut (which is too small to retain in the housing anyhow) has a smaller thread diameter that does not allow the use of the GoPro thumbscrew. It&rsquo;s almost as if RAM designed the GoPro adapters as a secondary after thought.I do like the twist lock suction cup mount. It provides a sturdy camera mount on glass or smooth surfaces, and the double socket arm is very secure and adjustable.Overall: <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars. I don&rsquo;t like how RAM included the GoPro adapter without proper hardware. The use of sheet metal screws to secure the ball assembly to the base is also cheaply done. It should have been integrated from the get-go and still allow for lean manufacturing principles. Otherwise it is a very solid mount.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this after my GoPro branded suction cup mount failed. The plastic/rubber on the GoPro brand would not hold and it appears to have some tiny cracks in it. I have used other Ram Mount products for GPS units and communications gear and have always had very good luck with their products. This one meets my expectations for a Ram mount and the suction cup holds to the window in my car with no issues. I took it for a very long drive from SLC, Utah to Portland, Oregon area a few weeks ago and the temperature fluctuated from 25 degrees to 70+ degrees with no issues with the suction cup mount. It worked great using my GoPro HD Hero2 camera as a &ldquo;dash cam&rdquo; and I got some great footage.</p>

<h5 id="gopro-adapter-needs-updating">GoPro Adapter needs updating.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the reviews for this mount and studied it as best I could online. It does seem as though RAM MOUNTS does not care for the opinions of their customers. I bring this up because since at least 2013 there have been reviews of the terrible screw and nut that are used to secure the GoPro to the GoPro adapter. This is still being used instead of the standard GoPro thumbscrew. I do not carry around a phillips head screwdriver just to change mounting options. You have to pull a thumbscrew and cap nut from another mount to use, beware though that the cap nut will fall out of this mount when unscrewed. This is the only reason for the 3 stars.When I received the mount, socket, and adapter, I was really impressed with the quality. I have used Ram Mounts when I was in the Army, they were used to mount computers and map display screens in our combat vehicles. These items were fairly heavy and the Ram Mounts allowed us to articulate the devices as needed and kept them locked into desired positions. This smaller setup for my GoPro Hero Session was manufactured with the same quality as the larger mounts.This mount is rock solid when installed on a windshield or other smooth surface. For security to guard against GoPro loss, you should always use some sort of tether. I stuck the suction cup to my desk and tried to lift it off, I ended up lifting the entire desk. The mount wouldn&rsquo;t even slide on the desk top, even after waxing the desk.All in all, good mount with a stupid flaw (thumbscrew). I do recommend this product for ease of use, quality, and company reputation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-grip">Good grip.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to set up like all Ram Mounts I&rsquo;ve used. The suction base holds tenaciously even during a relatively sprited ride (in the car) after stupidly trying to wipe a bit of dust off with a shirt (which made it linty.) I would only wish that it could mount to my dash rather than the windshield or have a shorter joint so that it could be higher up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-rammounts">I love RamMounts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ram mounts are amazing. Worth the weight and cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-when-there-is-no-room-on-your-handlebars">Perfect when there is no room on your handlebars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect stuck to my tank at 70+ mph for 19 hours from San Antonio to Los Angeles</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does exactly what it says it&rsquo;ll do. Took this on a safari and hat it suctioned to the windows and car itself and stayed on, even on the super bumpy roads.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-mount">AWESOME Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an ABSOLUTELY AWESOME GoPro mount. Once you tighten it down it doesn&rsquo;t move at all. Infinitely adjustable to get that proper angle. STRONG.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="holds-well-missing-vital-pieces-inexcusable">Holds well. Missing vital pieces. Inexcusable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Why am I not giving this 5 stars as many others have? Simple. The ball that attaches to the suction base requires 2 screws. Okay, not really a big deal, right? I agree.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">NICE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This suction mount is the best one yet ! Like all other reviews the screw is the only issue, I just used one of the gopro thumb screw for easy on &amp; off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-not-small">great but not small.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>everyone loves this brand, so i got one. it seems to work well thus far, but is a bit bulky compared to other suction cup options like joby</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-suction-but-a-bit-too-tight">Great Suction, But A Bit Too Tight!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a RAM Mount, so naturally it is about perfect. The suction cup is great, which is why I own many of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-1">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very Functional. Twists in all kinds of directions easily. Stays tight and in place</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-product">Love this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this product. Strong hold! I use it on the roof and hood of my vehicle. I do also tether for extra security, but it holds very well.</p>
