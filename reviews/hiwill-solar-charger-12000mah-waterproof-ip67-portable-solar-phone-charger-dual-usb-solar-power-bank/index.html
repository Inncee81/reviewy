<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-battery-bank">Great Battery Bank :</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first thing that caught our attention was the robust construction. It is encased in a strong rubber case giving the unit protection from accidental falls. The built in solar panel is perfect for the battery to get charged while we are on the go and would always be fully available for our phones to be charged immediately. Very useful while taking long flights or camping for a few days where we do not have access to any kind of electricity to charge or devices, this battery bank comes in handy as it utilizes solar power.With 12000 MAH it can charge our s5 for a min of 2 cycles. It has two USB ports for connecting two devices at the same time. It indicates the solar charging and storage capacity. We have hook to clip the device onto our backpacks, where it get s charged while we are biking, hiking or walking. We have not tested it for the waterproof yet, but the rugged rubber exterior tells me that it would be safe in any kind of environment. We shall update on this again.There are two LEDs and we have 3 light modes. Normal, SOS and Strobe. Very useful in case of emergencies. The light from the LEDs is bright enough to navigate us through darkness when we are outdoors. This power bank is lot better than the many other powers banks that we have been using in the past. We loved the product and would recommend to everyone any day.</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-portable-solar-charger">Highly recommended portable solar charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great solar charger with plenty of juice for most phones to get through the day.The waterproof design is awesome and I love the flashlight.This solar charger has a rugged design and is a tough one for sure.I&rsquo;ve been using it for several weeks now without any issues.The little clip that comes with it is perfect for my backpack pocket that has a spot for a keychain and that&rsquo;s where I keep this one.I&rsquo;ve used it in the rain and it just keeps on kicking.I&rsquo;ve tested this one for full days with a Google Pixel XL and an iPhone 6s and it kept both charging with heavy use for the entire day.The solar panels on this one are more than enough for our use.Very clear and easy to see power LEDs to let you know how much juice is left.Highly recommend for durability, waterproofing and all day power.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-and-very-useful">Great product and very useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When you live out in the middle of the mountains with frequent power outages, these are a must. It has two ports so you can charge two mini usb device simultaneously and two very bright LED flash lights on the end. I am not really sure exactly how long it takes to completely charge a phone from being completely dead as i just plug it in and leave it in the window sill when it starts running low. It is about the size of a cell phone so it is quite compact and easy to carry with you when you are walking outdoors. I enjoy taking walks and listening to music which kills my phone quickly. Now, I just hang out and rest for a bit and plug in my phone and bluetooth headphones and let them charge for a half an hour or so. It is very durable ( I have dropped it at least twice with no apparent damage thus far. and it also comes with a handy clip that you can clip onto a belt loop for easy carrying. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a cell phone or any other device that needs to be charged via mini usb (basically everything these days)</p>

<h5 id="great-product-with-a-lot-of-features">Great product with a lot of features!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wanted a battery that was more all-purpose. So after looking at a number of products I decided to get this one and test it out. I&rsquo;ve got to say I love this product!First thing I noticed was the very durable design. So it would be perfect for around the house, or if I&rsquo;m working on a project and needed to charge my phone, or even use the dual light feature on the device itself. It is also waterproof which is a huge bonus, especially if I want to take it near a swimming pool or out camping I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about water damage to the device.With my phone, I have been able to get around 3.5 full charges, but I&rsquo;m sure I could get 4 full charges out of it.I think the solar panel is a really nice touch but not something I would rely on or use often. It took roughly 5 hours to charge the battery via an outlet, I can imagine it would take a few days of direct sunlight to charge it with the solar panel. I think it would be great if you&rsquo;re outside and working on something or even going on a walk, you could easily strap it to the back of your backpack while the sun charges it and while you are charging your phone.Overall I think this is a great product and if you&rsquo;re looking for something with all the features it offers I would highly recommend!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="must-have-for-travellers">Must-have for travellers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This solar charger does charge up under the light or the sun. And when it does, the green button will light up so you know it&rsquo;s being charged. I have many power banks at home but this one sets apart with all the other ones I have due to its capability of being recharged under sunlight for emergency purpose. I do travel occasionally and there&rsquo;s not always an outlet that I can plug into to get my phone recharged. So this solar charger is the perfect solution as it will never run out of charge whenever there is light. I will carry this charger whenever I go travelling. The flashlight is very bright and is definitely handy to have during night time as well. Must-have for travellers!</p>

<p>This has been perfect for our fishing trips. We can take it on the boat and since its waterproof, we don&rsquo;t need to worry about it getting wet.</p>

<h5 id="love-the-idea">Love the idea</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charged quickly on the first charge. I have not charged using the solar yet. I got this primarily to keep for camping and as an emergency device. Very durable and well constructed.</p>
