<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="absolutely-fantastic-get-them-get-them-now">Absolutely fantastic. Get them. Get them now!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a young baseball player and don&rsquo;t have these, you&rsquo;re really cheating his/her growth. My Grandson had been struggling with throwing strength. A week of working out with these and his distance and strength has exploded! I am amazed how a 1lb ball makes such a difference and Grandma and Grandpa get quite the workout as well. These are fantastic! Throwing across the diamond is a non-issue now and throwing outfield to infield doesn&rsquo;t even necessarily need a cut-off anymore. Also, his batting has greatly improved since he can wail away at these &lsquo;dead-blow&rsquo; balls and they only go about 30&rsquo;, max. No chance of broken windows. I have a dozen.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mixed-reviews-but-great-quality">Mixed reviews, but great quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth on a review for a while. The quality is great and they stand up to a beating. I have a 12-14yo baseball team that we&rsquo;ve worked the balls into regular practice rotation. They&rsquo;ve held up to quality hitting and helped to improve their strength.My only dislike, I don&rsquo;t like the size. They are larger then a baseball and I don&rsquo;t like that. The grip is thrown off a bit and seems to change throwing positions for players.The players like them better then the baseball sized hitting balls from other companies. The quality and material is liked and they say they like the bigger size. The weight and slack the balls have is their biggest advantage. They use it in games of pepper and like the full swings and limited flight they get.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-set-of-heavy-balls">Very nice set of heavy balls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice set of heavy balls. I coach a machine pitch team (ages 6-8) and some of the kids need a lot of help. These heavy balls help train them to swing through the ball and swing with power. It is a big change coming from coach pitch or Tball to machine pitch, and some of the kids have trouble adjusting to the force required to hit the ball. These don&rsquo;t go very far (especially when hit by a youngster) but really help train the kids to put a good swing on the ball.I wish I would have purchased these sooner! Well worth the money!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="these-weighted-balls-are-fantastic-i-ve-set-my-rukket-net-up-in-my">These weighted balls are fantastic. I&rsquo;ve set my Rukket net up in my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These weighted balls are fantastic. I&rsquo;ve set my Rukket net up in my driveway (small), and am using these balls for TEE practice. They really let you know when you haven&rsquo;t hit the ball squarely or you lack follow-through. Also, even when you hit them well, they don&rsquo;t go very far, so they are easy to retrieve and don&rsquo;t damage anything! Highly recommended for those serious about improving the mechanics of their swing! The company provides great followup as well. I KNOW I will be buying more of these balls and other items from RUKKET.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-decent-price">Excellent Product - Decent Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product. I&rsquo;ve been using them with my boys to help them focus on making good solid contact and to swing through the ball. I typically use these while doing soft-toss, but also do underhand front-toss with them as well. The quality appears to be equal the more expensive heavy balls on the market.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-practice-aid">Great practice aid!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our 8 year old plays kid pitch travel baseball. We started using these at the beginning of the season at home and have seen huge improvements in his batting follow through and power. We can practice with these in a small area without having to spend much time collecting balls. They are well made and do not show any wear after a whole season. I expect that we will be able to use these for a number of years.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tc-balls-eat-your-heart-out">TC balls? eat your heart out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Way better than the total control balls. My 14U and 10U teams utilized these for a total of 94 games and over 30 practices. Only 1 of them has lost its plug, losing minor black sand like material out of it. I fixed it easily by using some silicone caulking creating a new plug/patch. I&rsquo;d say I would buy again but I bought two cases so I dont think I really need to.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-alternative-to-tcbs">Great Alternative to TCBs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I coach Little League for ages 8-10. We have very little room and time between games due to the size of our league so we have to get creative for pre-game warmups. I have Total Control Balls, Dick&rsquo;s Primed Weighted Training balls and now these. They travel a little further than the TCBs but for this age group, they still only travel 15 or 20 feet. They are also great for my kid in our small back yard for tee work, front toss and soft toss. I would discourage anybody from using any of these types of balls around decorative rocks/gravel or around chain link fencing. While I would prefer the performance and quality of the Dick&rsquo;s weighted balls, the price for 9 of these trumps both of my other purchases (TCBs and Primed).READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="work-great-for-soft-tossing-to-my-8-yr-old">work great for soft tossing to my 8 yr old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>work great for soft tossing to my 8 yr old, very glad I bought them&hellip;in general seem expensive for a rubber ball filled with sand, but all mfr seem to be similar price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tool-for-younger-or-less-confident-hitters">Great tool for younger or less confident hitters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for! Our team used them on Sunday and the feedback was instantaneous. Great tool for younger or less confident hitters, allows them to see what&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-training-tool">Great Training Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These balls are great. I use them during practice and pre-game with both my 10U and 8U teams not to mention with our 25+ older team that myself and my other coaches play on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-have-been-awesome-to-work-with-and-i-have-seen-great-results">They have been awesome to work with and I have seen great results &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought them this year for my 10 year old and he hits with a s500 18oz bat. They have been awesome to work with and I have seen great results within these 6 months.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great</p>

<h5 id="great-product-at-a-great-price">Great product at a great price!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these for a grade school team. I have used the Total Control balls in the past and thought I would give these a try. They are a little bigger and just a touch heavier.</p>

<h5 id="very-durable">Very Durable</h5>

<p>Great balls at a very great price&hellip;.very durable&hellip;..exactly what we needed for our team to get them to next level</p>
