<h5 id="it-broke-the-body-of-my-gopro">It broke the body of my GoPro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In theory, this is a nice bare frame housing for your GoPro with room for an LCD screen or extended battery pack. That it comes with a UV filter is also a nice bonus. However, this ended up being an incredibly expensive mistake and I regret buying this.I am an industry professional and am no stranger to GoPros or the multitude of frames and housings available for them. I needed a housing for my Hero 4 Black that allowed me to use the LCD screen and have full access to all the ports. This seemed perfect! After receiving it, I carefully inserted my GoPro w/ attached LCD into the frame except all was not well. It actually broke off the corner of my GoPro&rsquo;s body in the corner, near the lens. This $20 frame broke the corner of my $400 GoPro and I&rsquo;m not sure how it happened other than some kind of defect in the frame&rsquo;s plastic.So I did what I should have done in the first place and ordered a better frame mount. As soon as it arrives I&rsquo;m going to pull my GoPro out (I still need to use it for work) and then this frame is going straight into the trash can. I&rsquo;ve never had a frame or housing break the body of a GoPro before, and I have several cases full of both. It&rsquo;s just mind-boggling.Wasting $20 is one thing, but having to replace a Hero 4 Black due to the damage this product has caused. Ugh.. I am moving on now.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-frame-well-worth-it">Awesome frame, well worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great frame! Just what I needed. I do a lot of recording and although the waterproof case that comes with the gopro is perfect, it just mutes some of my videos, and well this case gives me best sound quality. Also, it&rsquo;s lightweight, and holds the camera very securely. I made the mistake though of ordering the frame with the Bacpac option by mistake, because my Gopro Hero 4 silver already has a screen, so I have extra space in the back, but I find it to be convenient when I&rsquo;m outside in thr sun, it gives me some shade to review my videos and pics, and really doesn&rsquo;t make it difficult to use the touch screen. Pictures are provided in my review. Overall, great frame, I highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an absolutely terrific case for my Hero Black and an excellent value with the included accessories. Here&rsquo;s why I like this.1. This is well thought out and designed, and is the case GoPro should have included with the Hero Black for consumers to use when a waterproof case is not necessary. It&rsquo;s easier to use than a regular GoPro case with a skeleton door and much more useful.Note: A plastic case did come with my Hero Black, but GoPro dropped the ball by not including all the cutouts that are on this case, especially a cutout for the mic. As a result the GoPro plastic case completely muffles the audio on my Hero Black, so it&rsquo;s no different than using a waterproof case.2. Unlike the GoPro case with a skeleton back, this case:A. Provides open access to the USB port, which means (1) I can power my Hero Black with a power bank and see the touchscreen the whole time (as opposed to using the Battery BacPac, which covers the touchscreen and requires relying on the GoPro app on a phone or tablet to see what&rsquo;s going on&ndash;just not as convenient for me), and (2) download the pictures to my computer without having to remove the camera from its case.B. Provides open access to my memory card, so I can swap cards while shooting.C. Provides open access to the HDMI port, so I can connect the camera to a TV without removing it from the case.D. Has a cutout for the Touch Display Sleep/Wake button, which I often use to conserve power. It lets me turn the Touch Display on and off in between pictures, but leave the camera on. GoPro completely dropped the ball in designing a case that covers this button, so you can&rsquo;t use it regardless of whether you have the skeleton door or waterproof door on the GoPro case. It&rsquo;s worth buying this particular case just to have access to that button when you don&rsquo;t need a waterproof case.3. The sound is not compromised at all by this case because there is a cutout for the microphone.4. It&rsquo;s easy to use the buttons for the settings and shutter on this case. Now I use the GoPro case pretty much only with a waterproof door for going into the pool, lake or ocean where I need protection against water.Note 1: If I&rsquo;m not going to submerge the camera, but just need protection against splashing, then instead of a waterproof door I use a skeleton door over which I have taped Gore Tex fabric (I bought a patch on Amazon) to keep out the water. I get better sound that way as opposed to using a waterproof door.Note 2: Unlike the regular GoPro case, this case offers no protection for the camera body or front LCD display. So depending on your activity, you might want to trade convenience for added protection even if you&rsquo;re not going into the water.5. This cases comes with a tripod mount, a screw, a lens cap, and a UV filter that fits perfectly on my Hero Black and protects the lens; that filter is good quality and doesn&rsquo;t degrade the picture. The case fits my Hero Black really well and looks good on it. Even though the case is inexpensive, there&rsquo;s nothing cheap looking about it.6. The plastic on this is sturdy, and is the same quality as the plastic case that came with my Hero Black. This case works well as a standalone or mounted on a camera extender using the tripod mount.Note: When not using the camera, you can&rsquo;t use the port cover that comes with the camera to cover the three ports when the camera is in this case. It doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. That&rsquo;s a minor point the company might want to fix in the future.If this case isn&rsquo;t connected to a tripod mount, you can easily pry open the case to remove the camera. But if it is connected to a tripod mount, then unlike a regular GoPro case where you just unlatch the case and the camera pops out, with this case you first have to unscrew the case from the tripod mount in order to remove the camera. That minor inconvenience is outweighed by the convenient access I have while using the camera.Bottom line: This is well made, well designed, very functional, and comes with a nice assortment of accessories. There aren&rsquo;t many bargains when buying GoPro accessories, but this is one of them.</p>

<h5 id="great-accessory">Great Accessory!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! At first, I thought that I was going to snap it in two when trying to get it on the camera but, it held up well. It opens up the possibility of using the usb/hdmi ports with it still mounted as well as being able to change out the micro SD card without having to remove the housing. It connects to anything the stock GoPro housing would. I bought both the one with the bacPac extension on it as well as without for my GoPro Hero 4 Black edition.</p>
