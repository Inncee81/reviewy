<h5 id="a-hammer">A Hammer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>KMASHI External Battery, Compact 5000mAh Portable Charger Power Bank Pack for iPhone 6S 6 PlusSeems an odd compliment? A hammer: A tool that is dead simple and performs its work without drama. That&rsquo;s a hammer. It says what it does, and does what it says.A nice, solid feel with the micro-texture coating which is coarse enough to prevent slipping in a sweaty palm, yet smooth enough to slip into a pocket.At just under 4&rdquo; (~10cm) long, it was surprisingly compact. I had to rethink my battery lives: My new LG G4 has a 3000mAh battery, this thing is 5000mAh. I believe it&rsquo;s close to that nominal spec. I use it to prevent a dead battery, and ran my G4, watching Amazon Prime video on 4GLTE streaming at high screen brightness, for 60 minutes. The phone was at 24% when I began, and 29% when I stopped. The KMASHI External Battery? One LED down in charge. At home, it charged up again in under 15 minutes. Not being a Qualcomm 2.0 Quick Charge device, this is an impressive performance.As others have noted, the LEDs are indeed dim. I&rsquo;m glad. There are few things more annoying than over-bright LEDs, especially blue ones, leaving spots in my retina and, to this old-fashioned Electronics Tech, theoretically draining battery life. There is no imagined emergency I can imagine where seeing the LEDs is a problem. In my brightly-lit kitchen, I can instantly see my device is fully charged and ready to go.Use it every day. Simple, dead-easy, works as advertised, well-designed. 5 stars, I wish all Cell Phone accessories were this good and this inexpensive.Note: DO NOT USE AS A HAMMER</p>

<h5 id="small-compact-but-has-plenty-of-power-for-your-phone">Small, Compact but has Plenty of Power for your Phone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I have to drive long distances or travel for work, I am constantly using my phone for directions or other apps. They really drain the battery really fast and there were times where I was on really low battery levels. I needed an external battery but there was a lot out there. Luckily, this one was on sale for Amazon Prime members, so I grabbed this one to try it out.And boy, has it been a lifesaver for me! This battery is small and compact, about 4.5&rdquo; tall and about the width of your refrigerator door. It&rsquo;s easy for me to fit both my phone and charger into my cargo pocket, although I can put them in my normal pocket but it&rsquo;s a bit of a squeeze. It has four blue lights to indicate how much battery life remains, which all four lights on being fully charged.The description says the battery provides about 2 charges for an iPhone and 1+ charge for a Galaxy 4. It depends on how you charge your phone. When I charge my phone, a Galaxy Edge 7, I put it in Ultra Power Saving mode. In this mode, I am consistently getting 2 full charges this way, and it charges up considerably faster. If I charge my phone in normal mode, it&rsquo;ll give me about a little over a full charge. The battery itself also charges pretty quickly. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll only charge for about 10-15 minutes, and that&rsquo;s enough to give me an additional full charge.This little battery has made my life easier and worry free about my phone dying. So if you&rsquo;re using your phone a lot and you need some extra juice, this is a great option to look at.</p>

<h5 id="ok-for-a-moment">Ok for a moment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my LGG3 cell phone. The cord it came with was faulty, so I used a spare one I had laying around. It worked wonderfully for about 2 months. It held about 1.5 times of my battery life and charged really quickly. Four little blue LED lights indicate the battery life left in the external battery. Unfortunately, it recently stopped charging all together. It was worth the price, but if you want a long lasting product, go ahead and spend the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-enough-and-cheap-enough-to-keep-a-spare-for-yourself-or-an-absent-minded-teen">Good enough, AND cheap enough to keep a spare (for yourself, or an absent minded teen)!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love this external battery! This is my third purchase! After buying one for my daughter, I purchased one for myself, and then bought ANOTHER one for said daughter, who lost it somewhere (she&rsquo;s thirteen, and this thing is very inexpensive, so&hellip;). The thing is, these are so good to keep an extra or two around the house for emergencies. And it gives my iPhone 7 Plus a full charge, plus a bit extra juice left for a top off. Well done, KMASHI !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="got-it-for-cheaper-with-a-coupon-code-but-would-pay-full-price-if-need-be">Got it for cheaper with a coupon code, but would pay full price if need be.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first power bank and I got it at a discounted price via coupon code but would gladly pay full price.I use these for my Lumia 640 and 635 which have 2500mAh/1830mAh batteries respectively. With 4 blue lights as indicators of full between empty, this bank fills my needs as I can charge my phones from 3% to 100% in little over 2 hours only using 1/4/1/2 respectively of the power stored.The 640 being the more demanding and more frequently used phone, I can get two charge out of it in desperation. I use this if I forget to charge my phone before heading out (which almost never happens) but when it does, this has me covered.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to buying this, I already had 5 kmashi batteries. They were really good and long lasting, my friends borrow, then forget to return them. That&rsquo;s why I had to order a 6th battery to supplement the remaining two I managed to keep for myself.I was disappointed when I got this, and noted as much on my initial review. It just failed after the first full charge. The company contacted me, and replaced the product without me initiating anything! Talk about excellent customer service.I have the replacement now for a few days, and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. It definitely lives up to the standard I expect from the company. My phone which I have to use all day away from any charger stays charged. My co-worker loves the texture of the battery, and keeps rubbing it. It&rsquo;s a bit disturbing. I have to keep it away from him before it disappears.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-product">Good Value Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with this purchase. I don&rsquo;t know how I ever went without having an external power source for convenience and emergencies. I like the cylinder shape as opposed to a rectangular option. Has four blue lights that blink to indicate the battery level. It would be nice if it could produce power while charging, but that&rsquo;s not a huge deal. It has enough power to charge my Galaxy Note 4 (0-100%) while I&rsquo;m using it and it still has 2 out of 4 lights. I would buy again, missing a star for charging issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-charger">Great little charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave this 5 stars because after using it many times, this is my favorite charger. It&rsquo;s smaller than several others but powerful enough to charge my phone more than twice in a&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great for when I&rsquo;m not able to plug my phone into an outlet to charge. It&rsquo;s lightweight and I&rsquo;m so impressed that I purchased two of these!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hold-it-charge">Hold it charge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had my doubts about this, but I have used it on the go and it charges quickly when you need it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This battery/charger works great. I carry it in my purse and use it when needed. Easy to use and the charge lasts for several uses. Very pleased with this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="portable-and-convenient">Portable and convenient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son&rsquo;s phone never seems to last him the day so communicating with him at after school events are a challenge.</p>

<h5 id="compact-and-efficient">Compact and Efficient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked up this little charger when it was on special. It does a great job for its size, and will charge my iPhone more than once.</p>

<p>Had this for about 5-6 months and won&rsquo;t hold a charge anymore. Charges for about 10 minute and then quits. Don&rsquo;t buy!</p>
