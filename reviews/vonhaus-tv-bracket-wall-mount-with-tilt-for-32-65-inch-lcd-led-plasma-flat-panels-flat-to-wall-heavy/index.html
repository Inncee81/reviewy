<h5 id="great-cheap-mount-holds-our-65-vizio-e-series-fine">Great, cheap mount - holds our 65&rdquo; Vizio E Series fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t beat the price on this mount. Bought this to mount a Vizio E65-C3 - I was a little worried at first since this was a really cheap mount and there were some questionable reviews. All in all, it took about 15 mins to assemble the wall bracket, and we had the TV on the wall in 30 mins. Seems very sturdy - just make sure you hit the studs when you screw the bracket to the wall!On a side note - with this mount there was very little clearance between the TV and the wall, so we had to plug in all of the cables BEFORE hanging the TV on the mount. Your experience may differ depending on your TV and where your ports are - but for the Vizio E65-C3, we could not access the rear ports once the TV was on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-wall-mount-for-the-price">Great wall mount for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I searched a few other sites and compared multiple wall mounts. My criteria was low profile, low price, ability to hold a 50&rdquo; LED TV, and tilt. My wife and I wanted to mount the TV above our fire place directly in front of our couch so there was no need for left or right movement of the TV itself.After comparing multiple wall mounts, I settled on this one, hoping for the best. For the price I figured it was worth a shot and I could not be happier with the purchase.Came well packaged, instructions were clear but not needed really. The picture on the front of the box is enough illustration to put this together correctly. Came with a level so placing it on the wall and marking out places to predrill was not difficult at all. The tilting motion is smooth yet stiff which is what I wanted. It took about 15 minutes to put together, half of that was the time it took to find the tools needed. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; socket is needed for the lag bolts, phillips head screw driver for the screws and a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; wrench for the little nuts on the frame were the tools to put it together and get it on the wall. I elected to not use the plastic anchors that come with the kit because I was able to mount it to studs. It comes with 6 lag bolts, 4 to go on the top rail and 2 for the bottom rail. I had to use washers on the back of my Samsung as the plastic washers that came with the kit were too big or the mounting screw for the back of the TV was not long enough, 1 of the 2. No big deal as it worked out fine, I had some spare washers from another project.Will buy another to mount TV in another room!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-good-value-especially-if-you-need-something-for-studs">This is a very good value, especially if you need something for studs &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good value, especially if you need something for studs more than 16&rdquo; on center. There are instructions for mounting the wall plate, but there are not instructions for assembling the plate itself. It was not difficult, you just need to lay everything out in front of you and take your time with it. If I can provide a tip for anyone, put in the bolt (the one that is notched for the square hole, that does not have a philips head) in first, with a washer and tighten. The other two can then go on and use a wrench to hold the bolt and tighten with a screw driver. I tried to put these on first initially, and then did not have room to tighten that center bolt. Once everything is assembled, this mount is really sturdy. I have an older 47&rdquo; Insignia LCD tv hanging on it, bolted into 2 studs and it is not going anywhere. You&rsquo;ll also need a really long Philips screw driver to tighten the bolts on the bottom to secure the TV on the mount. For the price, do not skip over this mount. No need to pay 2 or 3 times the price, this is what you are looking for if you stumbled on this listing.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-what-i-needed">Perfect for What I Needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 3, 1 for me and 2 for a friend. I love mine! Sits up close to the wall, tilts the right amount. It&rsquo;s a little hard to get one screw on once its on the wall, but unless we have an earthquake I think it will be fine as it is. I love love love how it looks on the wall and now I want a back light. The space that I wanted my tv was between two doors and the studs were odd behind it so being able to have multiple options for where along the mount to place the screws made it super handy (and is the reason I bought it - the first one I bought with a swing arm wouldn&rsquo;t work.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-main-directions-are-in-german-use-common-sense-there-america-is-not-the-only-country-in-the-world-and-with-a-name-like-vo">The main directions are in German (use common sense there - America is not the only country in the world and with a name like Vo</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Manufacturer needs to add directions for putting the wall-mount frame together, not just how to install it onto the wall. Customer need to look closely at the photo on the front of the box to see how exactly it&rsquo;s put together. HINT: a piece labelled A and a piece labelled B go side by side forming the top bar and the bottom bar. The main directions are in German (use common sense there - America is not the only country in the world and with a name like VonHaus you have to expect it&rsquo;s German) but if you flip over the directions, the English is on the reverse.</p>

<h5 id="some-assembly-required-if-you-re-not-remotely-handy-this-isn-t-your-wall-bracket">Some assembly required! If you&rsquo;re not remotely handy - this isn&rsquo;t your wall bracket.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an inexpensive wall mount that works fine, but must be fully assembled prior to hanging. Most similar brackets are one piece, with the tilt brackets screwed to the VESA mount and you&rsquo;re good to go. The instructions are good, but pictures are small so read carefully. On a scale of difficulty I&rsquo;d put it as a 4 (1 easy - 10 engineer) just because it needs to be put together prior to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mismatched-products-terrible-instructions">Mismatched products, terrible instructions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This may be the worst product I&rsquo;ve ever ordered on Amazon. The instructions that came with the mount were only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> in English. The rest are in French. And not that one side is in French, both sides of the instruction sheet are in French, but the last third are in English. When I put the mount on the wall I went to put the holding bolts into the wall anchors, and when I put the TV on the mount the bolts just slipped right out almost breaking my TV. So the tools in the product box are not even matched to each other. Just awful. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impossible-to-tighten-bottom-lock-screw">Impossible to tighten bottom lock screw</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a decent sturdy bracket and is great for the price however the way this hangs it doesnt allow you to get under and behind it to screw in the safety screw that locks the tv in place. it simply is not possible. you need a super long screwdriver but you still cant get the angle needed to screw the lock screw in. so i gave up, and since i know i am not going to rip the tv off the wall I left the lock screw undone and simply hung the tv from the top. its great for super tight space that you dont want the tv to stick out much.</p>
</blockquote>
