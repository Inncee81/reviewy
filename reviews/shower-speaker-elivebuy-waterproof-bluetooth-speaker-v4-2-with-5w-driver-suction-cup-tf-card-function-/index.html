<h5 id="good-portable-sound-helps-with-communication-for-the-hearing-impaired">Good Portable Sound/Helps with Communication for the Hearing Impaired.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had an opportunity to use this item for almost 2 months. I originally bought this speaker because I wanted something in my bathroom to where I could stream music from my cell phone by way of Bluetooth to an external speaker so I could hear music better while in the shower or bath. The speaker has had water splashed on it and it has not had any ill effects from it. I would not recommend submerging it though because I think that it would be beyond what it&rsquo;s stated capabilities are and would damage the speaker. I also had an unexpected benefit that was found to help my father. He cannot hear who he is speaking to very well on his cell phone and the speaker&rsquo;s ability to amplify someone&rsquo;s voice has helped my dad tremendously to be able to hear what the other person on the line during a conversation on his cell phone.Here is what I like about the Speaker:Very easy to take with you and set up anywhere.The capability of the volume, the volume has a very high range for a small speaker. (No problem hearing the music or the other person on the phone.)Sound quality, it sounds pretty clear to me.Being able to skip ads or go to the next song when you are streaming music from youtube using the next button.Quick Pairing of Device. (Pairs with my phone quickly and makes a sound when it does to notify you.)The fact that it is rechargeable (I do not have to worry about purchasing batteries for it)The only thing I did not like about the speaker is the voice that comes on that says power on when you turn it on and then power off when you turn the speaker off.Overall I would definitely recommend this speaker to anyone who is looking to take music on the go or to help with communication by using it as an external speaker for your cell phone.</p>

<h5 id="more-than-a-shower-radio-quality-sound-and-great-item-for-all-ages">More than a shower radio: quality sound and great item for all ages!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this thing. I got it as a holiday present and wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. I have had shower radios in the past and they usually die on me or just don&rsquo;t live up to expectations. But this little guy exceeded all my expectations.First things, this is SO much more than a shower radio. I know a few years back bluetooth cordless speakers were a big deal to use with IPods and cell phones but they tended to fall short: battery died or sound was poor. This little thing packs a great sound. Clear enough and loud enough to be moving about and still hear it. We live in a ranch home and I can hear this throughout the house, though of course it is most clear in the main area of the house which is comprised an open space of the dining/kitchen/living/play rooms. Music sounds great on it. I have also listened to some audiobooks and will say that sometimes the words aren&rsquo;t as clear if I&rsquo;m moving around or the kids are yelling or etc, but that is hardly the fault of the speaker alone.The speaker comes with a giant attached suction cup or the D-clip/carabiner you see in the picture. I have only used the suction cup. The clip is a bit small, a larger one might have been more useful, but may not have fit around the speaker&rsquo;s loop. However if needed you could just add the bigger D-clip to the one already provided. This small clip I can only see useful if you were to clip it to your pant&rsquo;s belt loop - a modern day version of carrying around a boom box maybe?The speaker came charged out of the box and I was able to use it right away. It charges with a micro-usb cord (included) which plugs into any usb charger (not included). We are able to use my regular phone charger to charge it and I keep the speaker near the phones as well. It will last a few days without needing to be charged. When it needs to be charged it will beep.This speaker has several different beeps which are sometimes hard to interpret. One for losing power, one for when your bluetooth device is too far away, one when it connects, one when it disconnects (I think?), one when it powers on (It will also say VERY loudly &ldquo;POWER ON&rdquo;), one when you&rsquo;re getting a phone call (triple beep) and&hellip;I think that&rsquo;s all of them. Like any relationship, it takes time to know all of your loved ones&rsquo; signals.The bluetooth connection has been fast and solid for me. I have been using it for the past 2 months almost everyday and it is a better and faster connection than my phone to car radio connection which I also use occasionally.Some &ldquo;cons,&rdquo; or rather, things I wish had been different:- No volume buttons on the device. Thought there are toggle buttons to change the song, this is nice, and works seamlessly with my phone, no lag.- If I disconnect from the speaker my phone still won&rsquo;t play sound through the phone until I turn the bluetooth on and off again, but I suspect this is an issue with my phone, not the device.So far, suction cup is great and strong. It doesn&rsquo;t loosen. Getting a phone call when listening to music has been no problem, my phone usually asks if I want to switch to handset. Again, that&rsquo;s a phone issue probably.I loved this speaker so much, several family members ended up getting it as a gift. They weren&rsquo;t as enthusiastic as I was, but I think in general it is a great item that is useful for everyone. Especially if they like listening to music/audiobooks/radio on their phone but need extra volume.</p>

<h5 id="the-sound-is-good-and-the-charge-lasts-for-a-long-time">The sound is good and the charge lasts for a long time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little speaker rocks my shower. The sound is good and the charge lasts for a long time. I can&rsquo;t give any specific time length, because some days are fast shower then out the door and some days I leave it running for an hour or so after my shower&rsquo;s over&hellip;Also: The suction cup on this has held for over a month - I left for 2 weeks at the holidays and didn&rsquo;t think about it, came home and it was still in place and ready to go.My minor complaints are:1. Yes, you can answer a call, but even if you have the music cranked up loud, the phone volume is really, REALLY quiet. I tested this even, by making sure my iphone volume was all the way up and had someone call from another room. The ring for the call is loud, but the call volume itself is very low and I don&rsquo;t know how to correct this&hellip;2. The only other complaint is style/design. the buttons are around the edge and easy to press, but not really easy to see when the thing is stuck to the wall. And the only indication to the exact location and function of each button is, well ON the button. So I just used a sharpie and made little +/- for volume, an arrow for play and a circle for power &hellip; I put them on the front green edge and it solves the problem. Of course, if this were slightly redesigned, the plastic could be molded with these symbols raised on it and problem solved more permanently&hellip;Update <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>2016</sub>:I&rsquo;ve now had this for a year and it still works great for music. I never did solve the problem of low volume when answering a call, but I find I rarely get a call while in the shower (like most people, I guess) so it&rsquo;s not as big of a deal as I&rsquo;d initially thought.The thing still holds a charge great and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier w my choice to go &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; on this speaker.I&rsquo;m buying one as a stocking stuffer for my sister this year.</p>
