<h5 id="ok-for-canon-ef-40mm-f-2-8-stm-lens">OK for Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While Canon&rsquo;s EF 40mm f/2.8 is a reasonably-priced, nice, compact lens,I was reluctant to purchase it, because that meant another set of filters.This set is of acceptable quality and includes a hood, which Canon omitted.Although otherwise seemingly not so nice as Canon&rsquo;s, the lens cap in this kit works well,without this hood, in 52mm threads.As others have pointed out, this kit&rsquo;s hood lacks female filter threads;Canon&rsquo;s lens cap will NOT work with this hood installed.That lack of threads prevents even the provided capfrom gripping securely, making it liable to falling off and being lost.I ended up not using this hood.Increasingly prevalent LED illuminationreduces occasions for fluorescent corrective filtration;those not needing such a filter might better separately acquirea 52MM Collapsible Rubber Lens Hood andTargus&rsquo; TG-52C 52mm UV and CPL Filter Combo.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kit">Great kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 67MM Professional Lens Filter Accessory Kit and they are all Vivitar filters. 40 plus years ago when I was in photography Vivitar was my go to. We&rsquo;re talking lens also. They allowed the average consumer to be able to be into photography affordably without giving up quality. They didn&rsquo;t fail me then, and I have no reason to believe they will fail me now.These kits are very well put together. It has all you need for filtering, UV, CPL, and FLD, keeping things clean, plus a lens hood. And the filters come in a sturdy case that keep the filters separated and easily accessible. A nice plus when you put them in your camera case.One of the biggest reasons I purchased the filters is for the UV filter. Not only because of its filtering, but because the filter provides a protection for your expensive lens. I would rather break the filter than the glass inside the lens. Also another reason I needed this filter kit is because it supplies a lens hood. Of course it screws on to the filter ring, but it&rsquo;s a lens hood none the less. My only concern will be vignetting; not sure how the 500mm lens will react. Haven&rsquo;t found a need to use the FLD filter, but the CPL filter works great. Rotating the filter to achieve that look in the frame is what I remember when I started photography long ago.Have to easily give this kit 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="filters-worked-for-me">Filters worked for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Being a complete novice with camera&rsquo;s and a typical American when I retired I bought a camera far beyond my intelligence factor, and no I do not read manuals I am an Engineer we know better. But I do read reviews before I buy something and after a lot of checking and weighing in the amount of money I had left after buying that camera, I chose these. Got exactly what I paid for and am very happy with the filters. Not sure about the polarizing filter but time will tell. I gave it four stars because the safety cord glue was a bit dry. All in all it is worth what I paid and everything threaded on correctly. I noted some people had problems with this.Good buy if your not a professional just a retired old man looking to save his lens. Have fun enjoy the ride life is great when you retire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-set">Great set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted the UV and Polarizer for my new DSLR, the extras were gravy. The filters are just what I wanted, good quality. But the extras are really great too! The lens hood is small and easy to pack when not needed. The filter wallet is really great! It holds 6 filters completely protected and it&rsquo;s small and pliable enough to fit in my little back pack&rsquo;s small front pocket. After loosing a couple of lens caps recently I put this lens cap attachment on one. I was very happy. The elastic fits securely, but not tight. I had also purchased one of these attachments at a local camera store and the elastic is really, really tight, gets in the way. So I am quite happy with this one. The small cloth is great and easy to carry anywhere. Great little set, will be buying another for different camera soon. Great price, great set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-accessory-bundle">The perfect accessory bundle!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the fact that everything in the way of must-have basic DSLR camera accessories was in one reasonably-priced bundle! I was planning to buy the Vivitar polarizing filter for my T3; but having the UV and fluorescent filters on hand will be handy. The storage case is downright handy. I probably won&rsquo;t use the lens hood, but it certainly seems like it would help protect the lens/filters. I&rsquo;m very happy with my purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-filters-and-an-excellent-value">Great Filters and an Excellent Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now purchased this product three times in three different sizes. I primarily use the UV and CPL (polarizing) filters, so the FLD is a bonus. You can&rsquo;t beat this deal when you consider everything else they include. The filters come in a nice soft case and are good quality. I highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-these-lens-filter-accessory-kit">Happy with these Lens Filter Accessory Kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great set for my Canon EOS Rebel! It is a good value too. I received my camera for Christmas and this was my first accessory kit. I bought it for a road trip out west and I was told that I need a lens hood for the bright sun. I am very happy with the purchase. The filters are solid and screw onto the lens fairly easily&hellip;.there is a bit of a learning curve&hellip;but once you get the hang of it, no problem. I especially like the carrying case for the filters. There was a letter from the seller promising full satisfaction&hellip;you can&rsquo;t beat that! Finally, the package arrived on time and in great condition&hellip;which is a big, big deal to me!</p>

<h5 id="good-enough-and-second-hand-to-own">Good enough and second hand to own</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the pouch that comes with. It protects well. I received 3 different filters, UV, CPL, and FLD.I don&rsquo;t really use them very often because I tend to use editing program to do some changes.Cap and tulip hood is cheap but don&rsquo;t mind having. I still use them on 58mm lens.Cap is not exactly the best and it&rsquo;s alright.Many pieces for a nice price!- 3 lenses- Pouch carrying case- Snap-on cap- Microfiber cleaning cloth- Tulip hood</p>

<h5 id="the-lens-filters-are-great-along-with-the-case-for-them">The lens filters are great along with the case for them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The lens filters are great along with the case for them. The lens hood is a piece of junk that actually becomes inset into the lens a bit due it being really thick plastic.</p>

<p>Fast shipping and delivery, good service, products as expected.It fits perfectly in a Sony DSC HX-400v model. No complains at all.</p>

<p>Overall good price for a good product. The recent eclipse was a great moment to use my UV filter. I appreciated it more than I thought I would. Not faced directly at the sun..</p>
