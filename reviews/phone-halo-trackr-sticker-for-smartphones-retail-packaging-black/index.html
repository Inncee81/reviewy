Find those missing keys in the morning by causing them to ring and using the app&rsquo;s distance indicator. If you can&rsquo;t find a phone that is on silent, press the button on the Tracker device and cause the phone to ring.

<blockquote>
<p>We had a trip planned for Disney so I thought I would get this to attach to my daughters necklace. This would alert me if she wandered out of range and if anyone else had the trackr app running it would pop up on my screen showing where she was. So I thought. NO.. this is really awful. I paired it and that was about the only thing that worked well. I wandered away from my wife and daughter intentionally to see what would happen. Nothing. just said locating. It did NOT alert me. My wife had the app running on her phone as well, standing next to my daughter, but I was never alerted that my TrackR was picked up by another persons App. It did pick her back up on my app after I came within range but it wasn&rsquo;t instant.As we walked around the park, I checked the app periodically to see if it kept up with our location, It did not. For about 3 hours it said the last location was on one side of the park that we had not been on for quite a while. I couldn&rsquo;t get it to update, even though I was standing right next to my daughter on the other side of the park.OVERALL: I am sorry I purchased this. I know it is not designed for a kid tracker, but it should have worked better than it did. It was slow to detect the TrackR when it was within range. It took several hours to update the TrackR location in the app. I received delayed alerts for when it was out of range. It did NOT notify me when my trackR was in range of someone else running the TrackR app. All the things it was supposed to do, it didn&rsquo;t. In my opinion, this device is not ready for sale.I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!</p>

<h5 id="hot-garbage">Hot Garbage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to use as a remote locator. I&rsquo;ve had it for all of 30 minutes, and am already regretting the purchase. First off, the tape included was garbage. It wouldn&rsquo;t stick to the bottom of my remote at all, and if I was supposed to do something special with that sticker, I wouldn&rsquo;t know because the instructions say nothing about it. Very disappointing that a product with &ldquo;Sticker&rdquo; in its name now has me researching double-stick tape to find something that will work. My other complaint is how easy it is to open it to get to the battery. Replaceable battery was the main selling point between this and Tile, but this is not secure enough. I won&rsquo;t know unless I decide to keep it, but I can see this thing coming loose the first time I dig my remote out from between the couch cushions. Same could probably be said if I were to use it for my keys - I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d be fishing the battery and cover out of my pocket from time to time.-Update-After doing some simple testing, I&rsquo;m dropping to 1 star&hellip;only because I can&rsquo;t drop to 0. I put my keys in my coat pocket and hung it in one room of the house. Now I&rsquo;m sitting in my office about 25 feet away, and the app is constantly spinning on &ldquo;searching&rdquo;. I got up and slowly walked toward it, and the app didn&rsquo;t find it until I was 1 foot away. Absolute. Garbage.</p>

<h5 id="trackr-says-no-warranty-on-amazon-purchases">TrackR says no warranty on Amazon purchases</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update #2: All 3 broke within 6 months of purchase. One was in my glovebox, one in my wallet, and one on my keychain. The keychain one took some abuse banging into keys all day, but the others were in relatively protected environments and still failed quickly. No wonder they don&rsquo;t offer a warranty.Update #1: 1 of the 3 I bought broke after only 2 months. I contacted them for a warranty exchange and they responded that they do not honor warranty for products purchased through Amazon. Revising my review to 1 star.Original review:I really like the idea of this. However, I quickly found that the separation alarm is useless and must be disabled. It alarms every 5 minutes or so even when the TrackR is in my front pocket and the phone is in my back pocket. Even sitting side by side on the desk it will alarm at least every few hours.However, I still find the tracking aspect useful and will continue to use it for that. The range isn&rsquo;t great (maybe 20 feet indoors) but if I do leave my keys somewhere at least after the fact I&rsquo;ll be able to look where the last place was that I saw them. I may get more to stick on some valuables. It is only a moderate chance of finding them if they are lost/stolen, but they&rsquo;re reasonably cheap so I figure a low price is reasonable for a moderate chance of recovering lost/stolen items.</p>

<p>Do not buy these. I bought 2, both arrived with a dead battery. I purchased 2 new batteries and they both died again&hellip; Less then a week later both stoped working completed. Just go to trackr website and buy the newer model.</p>

<h5 id="bummer">Bummer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is a joke. I was an early backer from their Kickstarter (or Indiegogo whatever) campaign and ended up with 10 of these useless devices. Here are the problems (in no particular order):Cons:1) Common misconception &ndash; this is NOT a GPS tracker. It will not locate your object if you are not within bluetooth range of it. (e.g. I put one on my dog and when he&rsquo;s in the backyard and I&rsquo;m inside, the app does not connect to the device because he&rsquo;s out of bluetooth range.) If I am within bluetooth range of what I&rsquo;m looking for, pray tell why would I need this device, unless I was a hoarder and couldn&rsquo;t find things within piles of other things I&rsquo;m in the same room with&hellip;2) Batteries are extremely weak and run out fast.3) Not waterproof.4) Even within bluetooth range, it often does not connect or takes forever. I have a new iPhone and connect easily with other bluetooth devices. I am technologically savvy and have tried the usual troubleshooting of relaunching the app, restarting bluetooth, pressing the button on TrackR device (on which the blue light is lit so it&rsquo;s not a battery issue), and any combinations of these things I could think of to no avail.Pros1) Can someone inform me as to what situations in which this device is ACTUALLY useful?2) Their customer service is good. I got all 10 of them replaced and they still don&rsquo;t work, but at least they replaced them.Am I doing something wrong?</p>
