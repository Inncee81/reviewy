<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome flash drive for anyone thats got a good chunk of their life on their cellphones. It allows you to transfer files easily between Mac, PC, iPhones, iOS devices and Android devices. It makes it incredibly easy for me to transfer photos I take on my iPhone 7 Plus onto my laptops and friends laptop, Just like transferring files with a standard USB drive. Finally, its got 32 Gigabytes and up to 64 gigabits of space, so you wont run out of space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this USB flash drive for my IPhone 6, well the IPhone I bought has 16 GB memory, mostly my pictures take a lot of spot and usuallyit never left a space to take sudden picture especially when i was in hurry so i have to delete some in order to take new ones but this USB helps me transfer my pictures from IPhone to this drive and Computer and it is really easy to do. in order to do this, The APP &ldquo;i-Easy Drive” is must, it transfer videos and images , also supports all my major video and music formats. The USB drive is portable , I can carry it anywhere. the speed of transfer is impressive This flash drive simply solved my problem, love it.</p>

<h5 id="but-the-usb-and-micro-usb-work-great-i-do-wish-it-came-with-some-more">But the USB and micro USB work great. I do wish it came with some more &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such a neat product. I never knew such a thing existed, I wish I had found it sooner. The SD card in my phone is full, so it&rsquo;s very helpful in storing and backing up files in case something happens to my phone. I don&rsquo;t have any Apple products, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to use that end of the stick of test the app. But the USB and micro USB work great. I do wish it came with some more info about the physical flash drive; it only has a pamphlet about the app. To use the micro USB (for Android), push back on the outer edges of the USB part and it&rsquo;ll flip back. Would be great for devices with non-expandable memory.</p>

<h5 id="back-it-up-easy-transfer-to-from-iphone">Back it up! Easy transfer to/from iPhone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This flash drive along with the i-Easy Drive App allows you to upload and download movies and pictures to your iPhone/iPad. It can also backup and restore your contact list with a click of a button! The i-Easy Drive App creates extra space on your phone by letting you download larger file, like high def videos, to the flash drive from which you can either transfer to your computer or another iDevice. You can create new folders on the flash drive and sort files. You can also password protect individual files. This is an easy to use back-up storage drive that I&rsquo;ll keep in my back pack at all times.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-storage-devices">GREAT storage devices!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this. it&rsquo;s a three in one memory card that you can plug into an iPhone with a lightning connector, or a USB plug, or a micro-usb, you can transfer things from one phone to another. from your computer to either phone. it&rsquo;s a great little tool to have. The only thing is it took me a few seconds to figure out how to use the micro usb. it is in the USB so you have to fold the USB down. It took me a little bit to figure that out. once I did it is a great little tool to have. Holds a lot of pictures, ect. Just an amazing diviice to have. I don&rsquo;t know how I lived without it.</p>

<h5 id="works-perfectly-with-iphone-7-plus">Works perfectly with iPhone 7 plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this USB flash drive. Just the fact that you&rsquo;ll free up memory on your iPhone is a very big plus. This flash drive is very easy to use, lightweight and compatible with (I know) iPhone 7 plus. I just plugged it into my iPhone 7 plus and installed the app. I like the size and the the color matches my iPhone. Having a password is great but I&rsquo;m always forgetting them because now a days you need to add so many different characters, so having this flash drive and able to use my thumbprint is wonderful. I would recommend this Flash drive to anyone needing more space. The delivery was very fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so unsavvy that I didn&rsquo;t know these existed and I was so sick of my phone saying storage was full. I&rsquo;d delete everything I could and it still would pop up storage too full. I&rsquo;ve had smartphones ith the past with an SD card and my computer is Windows and I didn&rsquo;t want to install another app, I found these and looked over the reviews and demonstration and really am glad I found something. I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to completely work everything but I&rsquo;m not that savvy. You do have to remove your case of your iPhone or iPad in order to get the device in all the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! My phone (it&rsquo;s an iphone 6) immediately recognized the flash drive, just like the instructions said it would.</p>
