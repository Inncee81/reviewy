<h5 id="top-quality-and-under-priced">TOP QUALITY AND UNDER PRICED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>whats not to love, minimal feedback, low background noise, and they last 12 to 16 hours on a single charge. the only thing that I didn&rsquo;t like is the charging time 6 hours but I love that I can hook up to the old USB on my computer and charge while I am surfing the web. what really got me was the price, I expected to pay more for such high quality. I will admit they are not the most attractive things in the world but a small price to pay to be able to watch tv and have a conversation with my wife without blowing her off the couch. In fact she sometimes complains the tv is down to low for her to hear. ahh part of life&rsquo;s little treasures I guess. if you want a good product and your broke like me, give these a try, you can always send them back if its not your cup of tea and your not out one red cent. Oh I called the company and I know when the light is green they are ready right?? NOT let them charge at least 4 to 6 hours, I was assured this had no barring on the battery life. in fact if you don&rsquo;t charge long enough you get a ghost reading and your charge wont last very long. I don&rsquo;t have anything bad to say, outside the charging cycle&hellip;.buy a pair and hear what your missing.</p>

<h5 id="no-one-can-talk-bad-about-grandma-around-her-any-more">No One can talk bad about grandma around her any more :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These sound OK for the price. There are at least two different kinds of hearing loss, without going into it, only one kind may benefit from a device like this. I gave a pair to my grandma who was basically isolated from everyone because she couldnt hear unless you screamed at her (and no one likes to scream at grandma, it just feels wrong). She was actually able to hear in one ear without me screaming if I was sitting beside her. It actually brought tears to her eyes and she started to thank me and I had to run away because I didnt want to cry too. One ear was still totally deaf but this definitely benefited the other ear. This set comes with two devices, so she is able to keep one on the charger at all times while wearing the other one. If you dont have a lot of money and want to at least give your loved one a chance of rejoining the conversation, these are worth it. She said she would have to get used to how they sound but she could for sure hear better. I put them in my own ears and sure enough, things were louder.</p>

<h5 id="need-help-hearing-without-spending-thousands-give-this-a-try">Need Help Hearing Without Spending Thousands&hellip;.Give this a TRY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My mothers hearing aids were broken so we needed something to help her hear while hearing aids were being repaired. These amplifiers worked perfectly. Great quality aids; easily charge in there own holder. Somewhat larger than todays hearing aids but worked when in a pinch. Only problem we had was mom had hard time getting used to the canal inserts. They do supply different sizes so a small ear can be abliged. They adjust for volume easily and the sound was of good quality. Can get high pitched sound/whistle if you cup hands over aids when in use but other than that they sure did help. I would recommend &lsquo;trying a pair&rsquo; if you are having some problems hearing but maybe not ready to spend thousands of dollars for todays hearing aids. They would be worth a try and if they do not work for you Amazon allows for returns so what do you have to loose. Oh yes, the box for storing these is perfect and not flimsy. Hope this info helps. The link attached is thru our smile.amazon.com account. We always use smile.amazon because it allows our purchases to donate % of our spending to go to organizations of our choice.

<h5 id="function-is-good-easily-adjusted">Function is good, easily adjusted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Function is good, easily adjusted. The only negative is the way they look&hellip;big , gold, and cumbersome. But they are well worth the price and they do clearly amplify sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-ones-i-ve-ever-used-never-going-back-batteries-again">Best ones I&rsquo;ve ever used, NEVER going back batteries AGAIN!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had few different kinds and at first I thought they were alright but over time they fell out of my ear or stopped taking a charge&hellip;..it was making me(and my kids) crazy!!! I got these because they looked strong enough to take everyday wear and I&rsquo;ve learned that the behind my ear is easy to use even with my glasses.I&rsquo;ve had them long enough now that I can honestly say they are the best I&rsquo;ve owned! Are they perfect? No! When I read people&rsquo;s complain that they are noticeable or its bothersome it makes me laugh! If you are looking for easy, cheap, beautiful answers to your hearing loss I&rsquo;ve got news for you!!! People don&rsquo;t care how it looks if you can hear them!!!! It&rsquo;s WAY more bothersome for them to judge if something is important enough to deal with what it&rsquo;s going to take to tell you!!These work soooo well that even my kids noticed and asked what I was doing differently&hellip;.. My grandkids love that I can understand the words more clearly. I&rsquo;m very pleased with them.</p>

<p>I bought these for my mother and she loves them. We do too, since we don&rsquo;t have to speak so loud for her to hear us. We also get a chuckle out of how softly she speaks now that she can hear better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouulld like to thank you for yorr fine product. after repeatedly tried some of your competers, with less than satisfactory results. So of course I was skeptical. The claims you made weree simular to otther brands claims. Ican noy tell you how suprised, I was when I put them in my ears. Sofar they are funtioning above the level of my $1,650.00 hearing aids. Now I am happy I took a chance on your product. The best buy of my life, and I am 82 years young. sincerly Virgil Mills</p>

<h5 id="i-will-buy-a-second-pair-these-work-great">I will buy a second pair. These work great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This met my expectations. Helps me hear what is happening around me. It would be nice to have noise cancellation and Bluetooth for phone calls but I like this and it works as well&hellip;</p>
