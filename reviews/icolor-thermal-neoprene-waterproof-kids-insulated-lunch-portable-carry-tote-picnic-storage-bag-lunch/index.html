<h5 id="folds-flat-and-holds-a-lot-of-food-see-photos">Folds Flat And Holds A Lot Of Food!! &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..See Photos~</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The folks from ProfessionalBags were kind enough to provide me with this neoprene lunch bag in exchange for sharing my unbiased review&hellip;This is a really nice lunch bag! I love that it stores flat but was really shocked at how much it can actually hold!I&rsquo;m uploading some photos just to give you an idea of how much food this thing can actually hold. It&rsquo;s a pretty awesome bag! Everything on the tray in my photos fit in the bag zipped closed&hellip;There&rsquo;s a banana under the bag of Tasty Bite lentils, a Rubbermaid container that holds 3 cups of soup, an 8 oz sparkling juice, a protein shake, bag of bunny graham crackers, and a bag of chips. Would I actually eat all of this in one sitting, lol, probably not but you get the idea!The zipper appears to be of good quality and I really appreciate that this bag is washable! No wash instructions were included so I&rsquo;ll probably just hand wash it (or machine wash in a lingerie wash bag if it gets really dirty) and hang dry. Neoprene, being what scuba gear is made of, should dry quickly!I thought the design I chose might look best for a teen but it&rsquo;s actually pretty cute! (Color: New Designs)My only gripe, which the description does warn of, is that it does smell pretty bad. It&rsquo;s got the Made in China factory smell, maybe you&rsquo;re familiar with it, not pleasant. Definitely a product you&rsquo;d want to let air out for a day or two out of the plastic before using or gifting! I rated it 4 stars for this reason.I&rsquo;d rate it 5 stars for quality if not for the smell. I&rsquo;ll update this review should anything change but I&rsquo;m guessing this is a lunch bag that will hold up nicely. Smile. Buy with confidence. Hope this is helpful!</p>

<h5 id="great-bag">GREAT Bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these Neoprene bags for my kids lunch boxes. They are SO easy to wash, a problem with past bags for sure. They are sturdy and hold up to really tough use, no seams splitting, no threads pulling, no wearing through on the fabric. An interesting thing I didn&rsquo;t think about when purchasing these is it&rsquo;s ability to hold spills in. Our kids often forget to close their water bottles when putting them away after their lunches, this leads to spills which used to fill their backpacks. This holds spills in really well. Overall, I would definitely purchase this again (and wish I had years ago).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-liked-it-but-returned-it">I liked it, but returned it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this tote bag because it looks so cute!When it came in, it looked just as cute in person!The reason why I returned it is because of the size. It&rsquo;s a little small for my liking and it didn&rsquo;t look like it would fit a lot of food. Also, there is no handle (which I did found another tote bag that did have a strap handle) and that would have been a bit annoying to carry around in my hand.Please do keep in mind that I am a commuter college student, therefore, I would have to carry this everywhere I go around campus. If you have a place to store this bag without carrying it around all day, then you shouldn&rsquo;t have much a problem with it not having a strap handle!Hope this review helps!</p>

<h5 id="way-more-spacious-than-expected">Way more spacious than expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Take note that some of these bags are Prime eligible which means they ship from the US and some of them come from China and will take several weeks to arrive. We bought 3 different ones (all dragons thanks to the interests of elementary aged boys) and this was the only one that was Prime. I am completely addicted to these bags now, they are way way bigger than I anticipated! The fact that they stretch lends their usage to a variety of possible contents. My sons usually had to take the items out of the large Lunchables in order to take them but with these they can just toss the whole thing in there and still have room for something extra! The pictures do not really do these bags justice. The zippers are much higher quality than I thought as well with a sturdy thick plastic zip tab that both my boys (5 &amp; 7) found easy to use. You can quickly hand wash these in the sink and then just let them dry. I probably won&rsquo;t bother throwing them in the wash. Plus, they are very easy to fold up and store or even hang on a hook. If I had to come up with a downside, it&rsquo;s that there isn&rsquo;t really a way to write on neoprene for putting your child&rsquo;s name on it! We will have to come up with another idea.</p>

<h5 id="cuteness-in-a-lunchbag-this-is-it">Cuteness in a lunchbag - this is it..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really cute bag with its beautiful prints, unique design (the print again), pretty in pink color, and a good size to pack a lunch along with additional snacks for a middle schooler who loves that her bag is easily identifiable and completely different from all the others when she arrives at the lunch-cart to pick up her lunch!! Phew, one long sentence to describe this bag!!Pros: Color, design, prints, cuteness, size (have packed a thermos with two additional snack boxes as well as a fruit in it with space remaining), uniqueness - We picked the light pink/rose colored bag with the France/Parisian prints. We have used it every school day for over two months now and it has held up so far.Cons: The material is thinner than expected for a lunch bag advertised as thermal. And since I normally have used a thermos to pack hot foods or an ice pack when need to keep food cold, not sure how long the bag itself helps in keeping food warm/cold.</p>

<h5 id="there-is-a-cartoon-baseball-player-on-it-that-any-fan-of-baseball-would-enjoy-the-picture-is-clear-and-has-bright">There is a cartoon baseball player on it that any fan of baseball would enjoy. The picture is clear and has bright</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a soft, secure and insulated lunch bag. There is a cartoon baseball player on it that any fan of baseball would enjoy. The picture is clear and has bright, shiny and vibrant colors. The bag has two holes in the top to make it easy to carry around. When you add your lunch to this bag there is a zipper at the top to keep everything securely inside. The bag is very flexible and you can add many different shapes and sizes to the lunch bag. The lunch bag is also very easy to clean. I have not washed it in the washing machine but I have used a sponge, soap and hot water and this has kept it clean, like new. The lunch bag works great to keep your food in. I also like when I have finished my lunch this bag can flatten to a very thin size which makes great for storage. I received a discount on this product in a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine.</p>
