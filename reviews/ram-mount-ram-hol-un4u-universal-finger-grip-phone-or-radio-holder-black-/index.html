<h5 id="works-with-iphone-6-plus-yes-and-no">Works with iPhone 6 Plus, yes and no.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been looking for a mount for my iPhone 6 plus for my Ninja 636. While the RAM brand of hardware is fantastic, this particular &lsquo;holder&rsquo; is a bit too small for a 6plus. It does work but you can&rsquo;t use all the hardware, the 6 plus is just too big. There is an iPhone 6 plus specific holder but it only works WITHOUT a phone case. They can&rsquo;t make a holder to fit all cases so this universal one is the best bet.I included pictures so you can see what I&rsquo;m about to say. There are two side pieces that keep your phone from sliding side to side. However you can only use one piece. All the available arms and side pieces are adjustable but with the 6 plus you basically have to have them all the way in the &ldquo;out&rdquo; position. There are 3 different sized &ldquo;arms&rdquo; that hold your phone with tension, 4 or each size. As I had to do because of the volume buttons, you can install the arms in three different locations on each side.My opinion based on using the various types of cases I have for my iPhone, the small arms are for your naked phone. The medium length arms are for a slim case and the longest arms are for an armor box type case. All my testing was done with the arms in the farthest position out, as the picture will show.I live in Michigan and most of our roads are HORRID! At 140mph on the freeway, at 25mph down bumpy residential streets, at 55mph down major roads with crappy pavement, my phone has been HELD TIGHT by this cell phone holder. It does its job but for an iPhone 6 plus, it could be BIGGER. I would still recommend this to someone with a 6 plus but I&rsquo;d definitely let them know about its few &ldquo;short comings&rdquo;. If something happened to mine I would buy it again. It does work but it would serve the iPhone user better if there was a larger model.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-protection">Fantastic protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this mounting system back in April 2013 to use with my iPhone 4s in an Otterbox Defender case. I do a lot of trail riding and unfortunately this relates to somewhat frequent falls. Having had multiple falls where the fingers have broken off, I can say I am beyond thrilled with the level of protection this mount offers.I modified the mount somewhat to hold my phone more securely. I use the medium fingers on the sides and a small finger on the top. This allows me full access to all the features of the phone and even allows me to have a spare battery attached to the phone (I use a New Trent iTorch IMP52D) while the phone is in the mount. Useful on very long rides where the iphone battery with GPS use just can&rsquo;t make it. The phone stays secure in the holder even over rocks and potholes.On a few occasions of falling a finger has broken off. The mount comes with 4 of each size so I&rsquo;ve been able to replace the broken ones with different sized ones where necessary. I will also say that even with only 3 side fingers and the top finger, my phone has been VERY secure.Ram-Mount has happily replaced the broken fingers through their warranty program. I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to recommend this product to anyone trail riding or just recreational riding. The mount itself is great and the customer service is top notch.</p>

<h5 id="versatile-mount-with-two-major-problems">Versatile mount with two major problems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount would be great if not for two issues. First as mentioned in other reviews, unless you are a model builder or own a set of jewelers tools you will have a hard time grasping the nuts in the groves they go in. I solved this by installing the nuts and screws backward. Much easier to get at them this way. The other issue is the &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; dont appear to be made of the same durable plastic as the rest of the mount. I&rsquo;ve had two of them snap already under what I consider minimal tention. Now I have to use the longer ones. They work but they are much longer than I need so they look ridiculous. Very disappointed because I have several Ram products that are of much better quality than this one.Edit: 12/29/2011Since writing my original review I have contacted RAM and had the broken fingers replaced under the lifetime warrantee plan. I received reasonable service with quick delivery but at my expense for postage. Theoretically you could just keep having ram replace fingers as they break but I believe they should just make them more stout. Still, they did stand by their product and its back in working order so im upgrading my review to 3 stars.</p>

<h5 id="maybe-for-something-very-light-and-very-cheap">Maybe for something very light and very cheap&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This holder was recommended to me by RAM&rsquo;s customer service, for a TomTom XL340S Live GPS. ( For anyone with the same issue, RAM&rsquo;s mount finder said their RAM-HOL-TO8U would work, but the Live version of the XL340S is slightly thicker and wider than the standard version. I tried inserting the GPS into the RAM-HOL-TO8U, and one of the end fingers promptly snapped off.) But this holder doesn&rsquo;t come close to fitting.Besides being incredibly tedious to assemble, as others have mentioned, the ends (RAM refers to them as the top and bottom; I suppose it depends upon your orientation) leave well over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; of play at the tightest setting. Also, the fingers aren&rsquo;t sturdy enough to hold anything with any heft. Maybe a cell phone or something similar, but I honestly wouldn&rsquo;t trust this to hold anything of value without additional straps or such to secure it.</p>

<h5 id="porr-quality-fingers-will-break">Porr quality. Fingers will break.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this product for about a year now on a weekly basis (when I ride my Harley). The short fingers are of bad quality. Even if you are careful they will snap. I ran out of the short fingers so I have to use the long ones which are of better quality but ridiculously long and will not fit as the short ones. I have several other RAM products and they are great but not this one &hellip; Anyone knows where to buy short fingers by the way?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="crap-quality-do-not-buy">Crap quality, do not buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fingers break off. While carrying it, I dropped mine without a phone in it, it fell three feet onto a hard floor and two fingers snapped clean off. The plastic is simply too brittle. Stupid stupid engineering! Shame on you, Ram! This is one to avoid. I would give it zero stars if I could. With proper non-brittle fingers this would rate a four.</p>
