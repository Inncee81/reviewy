<p>Awesome light&hellip;bought for supplemental lighting but it quickly took over my other lights of similar wattage&hellip;. love this light. Low temp. Cool running. Very bright.. already noticed improved growth.. great price,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-at-first-and-looking-forward-to-seeing-how-it-lasts">Great at first and looking forward to seeing how it lasts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since this grow light is so new that it doesn&rsquo;t have many reviews, let alone any long-term ones, I&rsquo;m going to try very hard to update this review regularly. The public deserves to know!After getting a cheap LED grow light that fizzled out after only 4 months of use (light comes on but much weaker than when I first got it) I learned my lesson: there are only two kinds of LEDs, the good kind that lasts and the cheap kind.So I went looking for a really good LED grow light, between 150 and 300 watts, for about $100 or less. There where a few nice options in the $90 range, but I went with this one because my indoor setup is small (18&rdquo; by 20&rdquo;) and I wanted the dimmers since 300 watts might be a little too much and scorch the veggies, and I figured the independent veg/bloom dimmers where worth the little bit extra.The box was very well packed with dense foam and the hanging cables in a bag &amp; the power cord packed in a separate compartment from the light. The foam even had a cutaway around the dimmer knobs so it wouldn&rsquo;t press on them. Amazon, however, just used not-enough packing paper to fill the shipping box, letting the light shift around a few inches. Certainly not a deal breaker, just check your light ASAP to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t damaged.Both dimmers turn smoothly and stay where you set them with the fans coming on at 30%, though note that there are two fans, one turns on for the veg dimmer, one for the bloom dimmer. Light is nice and bright. At the dimmest setting and using my green shades I gave the LEDs a quick glance to make sure all where running. They where. The manufacurer specifically warns against doing this but I needed to make sure it was working and I was using appropriate safty equipment.While the included hanging cables are very good, I prefer to use chains to hang lights as the links in the chain give you lots of options for exactly how high, where, and at what angle the light is. If you do this, make sure it&rsquo;s good strong chain. Lamp chains work very well as long as you aren&rsquo;t using very heavy lights and they&rsquo;re available at most hardware stores. Plus, chains just plain don&rsquo;t kink and fray like cables can.This round of growing has me starting 25 Komatsuna (aka Mustard Spinach) and 50 Magenta Spreen seeds. I spread them in moist good quality serilized growing soil in sterilized milk cartons with drainage holes (I&rsquo;m thrifty, but careful) and set them in my seedling dome with it&rsquo;s top vents closed and bottom vents open to keep in most of moisture but let a little fresh air in and the lights set about one inch from the top of the dome and closed up the grower, vents closed to keep the light and warmth in (the grower is separate from the seedling dome.) The manual for the light recommends 30% bloom &amp; 80% veg at 14 hours per day for germinating and I see no reason to argue so that&rsquo;s what the light and timer where set at. There are no numbers for the dimmers so you have to estimate what&rsquo;s 80% but since the fan kicks on at 30% it&rsquo;s pretty easy to do. Since my setup is enclosed I have a small fan to keep the air moving, and with no plants to turn it to I angled it to blow across the top of the light to help move the hot air. Any heat shortens the life span of LEDs and even a little bit more cooling can help. I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of luck planting the spreen outdoors, most didn&rsquo;t come up, so this is partly a test of those seeds too.They where put in yesterday late afternoon. This morning after the light had been on for several hours I checked on things. It was very warm inside the grower, which surprized me a little because I hadn&rsquo;t been using the heating pad. It wasn&rsquo;t too hot for the seeds, but it was near their uppper range for sprouting so I opened the vents on the grower and adjusted the fan to blow hot air out the upper vents. An hour or so later and the temp is just right for sprouting these seeds.Now, it&rsquo;s wait and see. I&rsquo;ll be updating.Right now, with all the vents on the grower open, it&rsquo;s still warm inside, and this is fine for what I&rsquo;m growing now but it&rsquo;s going to be a challenge keeping the temp low enough for the lettuces and carrots I&rsquo;ll be growing soon. I live in a chilly basement so don&rsquo;t need an air conditioner but I&rsquo;ll probably need to get another fan, which means more outside air coming in which means I&rsquo;ll need two fly strips instead of one and more energy used. I really wish manufacturers would stop using infrared diodes in LED grow lamps. Really, I know radiant heat is good for most crops and it means it&rsquo;s another band of light that makes a full spectum lamp sound more impressive, but lettuce and many other plants hate heat and they&rsquo;re commonly grown indoors. There are heaters or lights that run hot, they are very easy to come by and we can add those to a setup if heat is needed. Just please, please, stop putting IR diodes in LED lamps. Many growers find them a waste of electricity and a problem to deal with.Another lesson I learned: If you&rsquo;re starting out with small scale supplemental lighting/indoor growing and want to see if LED lights are for you, it&rsquo;s probably cheaper and easier to use a few household bulbs with a good color balance than an LED specifically for growing because the bulbs work, are cheap, easy to find, last, and are still energy efficient. There are also E26 (standard socket) red/blue LED grow lights for if and when you want to upgrade, and if you find indoor growing isn&rsquo;t for you you can just use the bulbs in your home.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-buy-great-price-and-great-deal">Awesome buy! Great price and great deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome buy! Great price and great deal. I have 6 of these L.E.D. growlights that I use in my hibiscus seedlings. My seedlings have germinated perfectly. I like how the lights are dimmable and you can switch from blue light spectrum to red light spectrum or both at the same time. This is a great product for germination , blooming, growth, or general light supplementation for any plant type. 😆👌</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="100-satisfied">100% Satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can truthfully say that I was surprised by the quality of this light. The housing is made of quality materials, feels very strong and well put together. The lights are actually very nice looking and give off a deeply penetrating light but with little to no heat emitted.The fact that it gives you a choice of modes as well as a dimmer switch sets this light apart from most of the others.You can hear the fans but they are not roaring loud. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase and the quality. I would recommend this to anyone who wants the best quality possible without spending unnecessary dollars.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-mid-range-led">A Great Mid Range LED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I researched grow LED lights 2-3 weeks before choosing this brand and at the time there were only 11 reviews on this one, but it seemed like the right one, cost was a little higher than comparable lights but based on reviews and spec&rsquo;s the build quality was all a little better plus 3 years warranty. I received the light quickly the manufactures box is heavy made and the switches are smooth and work well, it&rsquo;s very bright too. Just remember very young plants and seedlings can&rsquo;t handle the full power at less than 30&rdquo; the par level hitting them is too high, even if the plants stay green they can be stunted from to much light, this is where the dimmers are great you can put the light 12&rdquo; away with veg light on 30% &amp; bloom light off, your not going to get the light coverage to spread much more than the size of the light itself at this distance, but if the seedlings are in cups just push them close together. As the plants grow you can raise the light and increase the power output to the veg light, by week 3 you should be at 100% with 50% on the bloom light, by the end of this week 3 both should be at 100% and between 18-22&rdquo; this height will be pretty good up to about a 28&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; area, for a larger area it must be raised to 24&rdquo;-28&rdquo; then you can get the 24&rdquo; x 24&rdquo; area but at reduced par (amount of usable light to plant) on the plants. This is why for top growth and quantity at harvest you want some side lighting also and this is very easy using 2 CFL&rsquo;s oneach side of the tent or grow area left and right, and 2 at the front or back middle a total of 6 these should be 26 watt 2700k CFL&rsquo;s with these lights added you now can increase the grow area to 36&rdquo; wide and 24&rdquo; deep and this 300 watt true output (including the CFL&rsquo;s added) with outproduce a 250 watt HPS setup with much less heat. with the added CFL&rsquo;s you can grow 3 plants to 24&rdquo; high maybe a little more instead of 2 to about the same height and as a bonus each is a backup to the other in case of a failure and the plants wont be in the dark until a replacement is secured / hopefully never needed / you will need to buy the adjustable hangers. Think about this too Your Your plant Containers will be 10&rdquo; or so lets call it 1 foot, the light cant be closer than 15&rdquo;-16&rdquo; from the top of where it being mounted like a tent because the hanging cables wont let it get closer, the light must be at least 16&rdquo;-18&rdquo;above the plants, so a 24&rdquo; plant will require a vertical growing space of 54&rdquo; so the smallest tent should be 60&rdquo; high that gives you a few inches to play with and not have to jam up the light to the top. I do highly recommend this light.</p>
