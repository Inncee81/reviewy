<h5 id="eh-nothing-special-edit-one-of-the-fans-stopped-working">eh, nothing special (EDIT) One of the fans stopped working&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(EDIT) On of the fans just stopped working&hellip; Now it barely moves any air, I would recommend against buying this. ANOTHER EDIT, another fan stopped working&hellip; this thing is junk.Disappointed, but its my own fault, i didn&rsquo;t really measure for it.Its pretty small, smaller than i would have guessed.It doesn&rsquo;t move as much air as i&rsquo;d hoped either.Also, the only way to reverse the fans is to turn the whole unit around in the window, and their is no exchange function, which i love on all my other window fans.There is side-by-side comparison of a traditional window fan along with the Bionaire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="smaller-and-quieter-than-my-previous-window-fans">Smaller and quieter than my previous window fans</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had several types and brands of window fans, and they run for days at a time in my apartment on exhaust mode to remove smoke, cooking/frying smells, etc. This fan is by far the smallest in height - almost half the size of the other dual fan types.The pros:- Much smaller in height- Much quieter- On high it delivers better performance than the dualThe cons:- Does not fit as well in my window - there were large gaps that I had to cover with tape to get adequate sealing/performance- Unless you run the fan on high all the time ( I do ), one or more fans will not be spinning&hellip;(on low only one spins, medium two, high all three), so unless you run it on high, you run the risk of bugs coming in etc/basically have an open window. Not a huge deal because the fan is quiet on high - but worth noting</p>

<h5 id="must-be-oiled-or-they-will-seize">MUST BE OILED, OR THEY WILL SEIZE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><Air flow><In>Standing on the doorway, 12 feet away from the window (slightly oblique), I could feel the breeze from head to toe. I would guess that&rsquo;s as good as 20&rdquo; box fan on low.<Out>After dinner, the smell of food often lingers in the second floor hallway. In about 20 minutes of fans blowing air out the second floor window, I could smell nothing. These little 5 inch fans moved air 50 feet from kitchen door through one of the rooms upstairs. *I tried to work the fan with the wind both in and out. Not against the wind. I opened windows in other rooms too.<Noise>You can immediately tell that the fan is on as soon as you enter the room, but it&rsquo;s not like big blades making wind-chopping noises like box fan or range hood fan. It&rsquo;s smoother kind of fan noise. If I turn on only 1 fan, I can hardly tell if anything is on.<Minor annoyances>1) One fan is very smooth, but one other fan is making small vibration.2) Fans are uni-directional, so I have to turn the fans around if wind direction changes.3) Stinky black rubber on either end leaves small black stains (but rubs off).4) I wish fan speed could be controlled instead of turning on one by one.<Problem>1) Without lubrication, fans will seize.2) Switch has voltage spike or something. I had it plugged on the same surge protector as my computer. Every time I turn on or off the switch, &ldquo;Pop!&rdquo; from my speaker. Maybe because the plug has only 2 prongs instead of 3?<Verdict>It works for me. It&rsquo;s shallow enough that I can leave the bug screen. It can suck out fajita smell all the way from downstairs kitchen in about 20 minutes. Neither ceiling fan nor AC can do that. From 2 feet away from my head, it&rsquo;s somewhat noisy. But thanks to 9 blade fans, it&rsquo;s more of a white noise than chopping propeller noise of box fans. Despite dangerous sounding popping speaker noise with the switch, I might buy another; one room in the south can blow in, while the room in the north can blow air out.<Update: July 2016>These fans need a few drops of oil every few months (motor oil will do the trick). These fans have a steel axle resting on copper bushings. NO BEARINGS. IF YOU DON&rsquo;T LUBRICATE THE AXLES, THEY WILL SEIZE ON YOU. It&rsquo;s not hard to do. But you must unscrew 20 screws and screw them back on. There is an axle clamp on the fan, but it&rsquo;s not hard to take it out. I found that the motors get quite hot too. Under each fan, there is a plastic cover that&rsquo;s almost completely encasing the motor. Since my fans won&rsquo;t get a lot of dust or rain, I took those motor covers off. The center part of the fan is already a cup-shape, so I don&rsquo;t know why motors are doubly covered. No cover should keep the motors run cooler, and burn off less lubricants. I&rsquo;ve used one drop of clean motor oil on the front and back side of the axle on all 3 motors (total of 6 drops) and that seems to work. Don&rsquo;t buy this fan if you are not willing to take it apart and lubricate it. If you don&rsquo;t lube the axles, don&rsquo;t be surprised if they die on you after a year.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-for-small-rooms-in-double-hung-windows">Excellent for small rooms in double-hung windows</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for small rooms. This won&rsquo;t cool a room like an air conditioner but moves the air so you feel comfortable without being blown about, as with a box or larger fan. It&rsquo;s black color is much less conspicuous in your window than white or metallic would be. It fits under a double-hung window and does not require a support brace. A bonus is that it can be turned around to be an exhaust fan as well. And it is truly quiet, although not as quiet as some of the high-end fans. I bought one on Amazon knowing I could easily return it but then bought another; this Seattle record-breaking heat requires extreme measures! The only caveat is that it is designed to work with a screen to block bugs and debris. I use the expandable screens which work well.I plan to use one during colder weather in my kitchen window as an exhaust fan. And the price is quite reasonable and when you throw in free shipping, well, what more can be said?</p>

<h5 id="bad-ass-little-fan">Bad ass little fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>dont know why ppl are bitching about this not being a great window fan. it 100% circulates the air around my apartment in seconds. i smoke , witch is why i bought this one. tested it right out of the box , and fyi im not using the type of window that this fan is built for. i have a side to side window instead of the recommended up and down. still even with all the room of open space it works awesome. i can smoke in my room and watch the smoke clear out in seconds. its a bad ass little fan. i def recommend it to anyone in an apartment or for you room if you. and it really does cool you off on hot days. its super quiet as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meh">Meh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really just blew warm air in from the outside. Only works when it&rsquo;s cool outside, but then you wouldn&rsquo;t need the fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointed-in-this-fan">Very disappointed in this fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed in this fan. I spent the extra money because I wanted a window fan that pushed air faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-black-and-blue-model-looks-great-in-person-works-well-too">The black and blue model looks great in person, works well too.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak on how long these will last yet, but I have a black model and a while model and they look even better in person than on the website.</p>

<h5 id="not-buying-again-i-guess">Not buying again I guess..</h5>

<h5 id="love-the-size">Love the size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the size, but my fault I thought it had an exhaust feature. Oh well it has all the other features I was looking for!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fan-works-well">Great fan works well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the first fan in Fl, after I returned home and found out just how good they work, I went on line and order two more.</p>

<p>Use it in kitchen and works well.</p>
