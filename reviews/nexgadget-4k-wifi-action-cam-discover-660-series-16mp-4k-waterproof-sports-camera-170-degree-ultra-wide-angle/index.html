<blockquote>
<p>Camera with a long battery, okay video quality, subpar sound, but great price.It is &ldquo;I get what I pay for&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s got a ton of accessories and good for the price.The video quality is okay. It&rsquo;s definitely not a real 4K camera, but those cost $600+ and don&rsquo;t come with any accessories. The rolling shutter is noticeable but doesn&rsquo;t destroy the video. The quality isn&rsquo;t 4K, but it&rsquo;s not complete potato quality either. The sound on this is pretty bad. It&rsquo;s about the same as all other cameras in this price range, so I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything different. Again, this isn&rsquo;t a professional camera. It&rsquo;s a tiny action cam.This isn&rsquo;t going to be DSLR quality. This is an action cam, so when it says 4K I know it&rsquo;s upscaled.The camera also doubles as a dash cam. It also has looped recording.It comes with a ton of GoPro accessories, which is pretty nice addition. Also, the second battery is nice. I wish it came with a microSD card, but that is a minor complaint, since they are cheap.Overall, a decent camera for a decent price. Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="go-without-go-pro-this-camera-is-way-cheaper-and-still-packed-with-features">Go without Go Pro! This camera is way cheaper and still packed with features!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I don&rsquo;t know why it was so hard for me to justify buying an &ldquo;action camera&rdquo; before now when I&rsquo;ve gone on so many &ldquo;adventures&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been sky diving twice, hot air ballooning, took flying trapeze lessons, rode elephants and played with full grown tigers in Thailand, swam with dolphins and snorkeled with whale sharks in Mexico, spear fished and rappelled down a water fall and into a sink hole in the rain forests of Puerto Rico, been scuba diving all over the world, climbed to the top of the tallest ancient Mayan temples in Guatemala, explored sacrificial caves in the jungle of Belize, hiked to the top of mountains in Brazil, bungee jumped off the tallest tower in Macau etc. I&rsquo;ve always just used my iPhone in a cheap waterproof case (or nothing at all) to document these adventures, but on my most recent trip to Thailand, while bathing elephants in the river, my case leaked and my iPhone 6 drowned. It was a horrible day and I vowed not to put my precious phone in jeopardy again. So recently when I was given a paragliding lesson as a Christmas gift by my husband, I decided it was time to try one of these cameras, but I didn&rsquo;t see why I had to pay for a Go Pro. Enter this camera. It did everything I wanted it to do and more and worked like a charm to capture my first paraglide! See video (I shot it in 1080). Here&rsquo;s what I like about it and what I don&rsquo;t:- VIDEO QUALITY: The video quality is really great (ASSUMING YOU HAVE PURCHASED A HIGH QUALITY SD CARD!!)- ACCESSORIES: This camera comes with everything except the kitchen sink (and an SD card). There is no limit to how you can mount it. For my paraglide, I used the clip holder and clipped it onto my harness. It was perfect!- WIFI: This was unexpected but turned out to be one of my favorite features. Being able to connect it to my phone any time (before, during or after my adventures) to view, edit or share content, change settings, see what my camera sees etc. is awesome!- SIZE: I know most cameras of this type are small but man, this thing is itty bitty, but still has a great screen that takes up the whole back side!- EASE OF USE: This is very easy and intuitive to operate (that goes for the app as well) and doesn&rsquo;t require a 50 page manual of instructions to understand.Here&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t like as much:- NAVIGATING SETTINGS: If you don&rsquo;t have a phone connected to it via WIFI, navigating through the settings watching or doing anything with the video you shoot (besides powering on and off, switching between video, photo and playback mode and recording) is NOT easy to do AT ALL. It&rsquo;s so tricky that I just avoid messing with that stuff at all unless it&rsquo;s connected to me phone. This is not a big deal for me, but may be for some.- WIFI NOT 100% RELIABLE: A few times I&rsquo;ve had trouble getting my phone to connect or stay connected via WIFI for long periods of time. Sometimes it has kicked me off and I&rsquo;ve had to manually reconnect.- APP CRASHES OCCASIONALLY: A few times while transferring large files, the app crashes spontaneously and I&rsquo;ve had to restart and try again, but it always works for me in the end. Even the most well developed apps crash from time to time. I try to give a little lenience for that.- CAN&rsquo;T SAVE TO CAMERA ROLL: This is really frustrating. When connected via WIFI, there is just about every option in the world to share or upload your video to social media etc. but there is no option just to save the media to your phone&rsquo;s camera roll! The closest I could get was importing it to Pinnacle Video Editor (my app of choice for video editing) which I would most certainly do anyway, but still. That bugs me. It also bugs me that you can only transfer one video at a time and can&rsquo;t select multiple files at once. These are more minor things though.At the end of the day, the most important thing to me is that this camera reliably captures my adventures in high quality and that I can do whatever I want with those files. I think for how well it works and what it comes with at this price point, it definitely deserves 4 stars! If you want a Go Pro but don&rsquo;t want to break your bank, I highly recommend giving this one a try!</p>

<h5 id="great-action-camera">Great action camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The Nexgadget Discover-660 has a slightly different shape than many of the other action cameras which gives it a slightly larger overall size. This allows for a larger battery which is a bonus. Included with the camera is a waterproof case, open case, wire ties, steel anchor cable, cleaning cloth, velcro straps, user manual, stick on mounts, J-Hook mounts, handlebar mount, clip mount, charger, and two batteries. Pretty much everything you need to cover all common scenarios is included. The only thing you will need to purchase is a micro-SD card, which I recommend a 32GB class 10 for 4K recording. The camera is waterproof up to 30M when using the included case. It is capable of shooting video in 4K @ 24fps, 2.7K @ 30fps, 1080P @60fps (which I think is the sweet spot), and 720p @ 120fps for slow motion shots. It is also capable of shooting stills at 16MP and burst mode for sequence shots. The adjustable wide angle lens can be adjusted up to 170* and the software allows for plenty of video and picture adjustments.Overall this is an awesome action camera for the price. I wish they were able to bump the 4K recording up to at least 30fps but 24fps is still enough for casual video. The camera really shines at 1080P60 though where the resolution and framerates are high enough to get clear actions shots as demonstrated by dog in the attached video. Even with the camera strapped to his back the video remains clear and sharp at all times. Like many action cameras this one tends to over saturate the video but I personally like it.If you are in the market for an inexpensive action camera that performs well, this is a great choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent camera for many extreme uses, much better quality than anticipated, really impressive set of accessories! I have dealt with a few action cameras before and this one is by far the best in terms of video-picture quality, screen quality, ease of use. It comes with standard and excessive accessory set, most of pieces of it I still don&rsquo;t know how to use but it really is a shortcoming of a rather short manual, which could be a bit more explanatory as far as accessories go. Otherwise I did not need a manual to understand how camera functions and I was able to set it up in just a few minutes. There are just 3 buttons that have multiple intuitive functions depending on the current mode.I love the fact that there are two nice batteries, not just one, excellent waterproof box as well. Great build quality. The only other thing I&rsquo;d like to see is a some kind of carrying case for all these accessories and camera itself, it would be useful.I did not upload a video here as Amazon makes it look terrible, but I&rsquo;ve made a few pictures.</p>
