<p>This is the protective wire only! If you want the whole suction cup kit, look for The GOMA Solid. Those who fear none perform better. Once you make your gopro virtually invincible, you will use it in all its potential. Use this stainless steel tether in countless situations: • Shots outside the car. Attach your suction cup in your desired spot, wrap the wire around your rear view mirror (or anything you can wrap the wire around) and fasten your gopro. Then drive away! • Diving. We love diving. We also know how many things you have to monitor while underwater. Pressure gauge marks 2000, you need to stay at 35ft for awhile, there is water in your mask you need to blow away, and you have to compensate. Suddenly you realize your gopro is somewhere in the bottom of the ocean with all your footage. Use this tether and forget about ever leaving your gopro for the sharks to play with. • Bikes. You turn your bike on, attach your gopro to the handle, the mount becomes loose&hellip; You get the point! This will make EVERYTHING EASIER! Because you can forget about losing your gopro, you can begin using it properly and better. How do you use this?Your safety anchor could be a bike frame, a pipe or a rear view mirror. Pass one end of the wire through the loop on the opposite end and tighten around the safety. Pass the other loop through the narrow end of the gopro thumbscrew. Lock the camera with the thumbscrew. You&rsquo;re ready to go! Some technical details: Length: 3 feet. If you need to shorten it, simply loop around your safety anchor a couple more times. Thickness: 2mm.Compatibility: gopro Hero, Hero2, Hero3, Hero4. Any camera that uses a similar system.Maximum resistance: Tested up to 3 pounds and may hold even more. Any small point and shot camera and even DSLRs with small lenses may work fine. Join the GOMA club. Click on ADD TO CART now and simply stop worrying about it!</p>

<h5 id="ok-so-i-love-techy-things">Ok so I love techy things</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok so I love techy things, at 53 I just can&rsquo;t help it&hellip;. So when I saw the GpPro 4 had to have it. Lord knows how that was the first time I had the chance to see one was only a few months ago, but life happens and I came home and did three weeks of research before getting out the card and purchasing the 4 silver. I am doing a cruise in May which is why the interest in this great tiny camera. Then came the research to protect this investment from the clumsy one me LOL I intend to use the suction cup and the tether on my balcony on the cruise&hellip; and will update this review then. First off, the tether is about 4ft. long, and can roll up and fit in about anything you need it to. The entire thing has a black rubber coating over the entire tether. The size of the loop at the end of the tether is the perfect size to fit around your Go Pro bolt but not too big to slip over. It&rsquo;s also pretty thin, yet that doesn&rsquo;t hurt the quality or strength of the product. I love the ease in using this !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-strong-and-decent-length">Seems strong, and decent length</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The plastic wrapped stainless is a nice touch to keep from marring the surface of your machine. I do worry that the crimps may come loose but they seem pretty solid so far. One star down because the metal crimps on each end aren&rsquo;t covered in anything (I&rsquo;ll most likely use heat shrink)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea-but-read-the-info">Great idea BUT… ( read the info )</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this thinking it was a case ( as u see the case in pic ) for my go pro hero 5 black edition. It showed up and was not it, its my fault for not reading lol. Anyways for 10$ is kinda steep on the pockets just for a TETHER. I asked the company questions who wouldn&rsquo;t stop bothering me that they IGNORED. Although it seems like it will do its job. I just picture my go pro flying off and smacking the side of my suv. So this is why I gave it 3 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-tried-it-out-and-the-first-thing-i-liked-was-the-length-of-it">I tried it out and the first thing I liked was the length of it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a newbie to the GoPro world, but I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to see my new skidding down the pavement behind my car so I started looking for a tether and came across this one. It&rsquo;s a cheap price, but very well made. It&rsquo;s a steel cable with a protective coating. No sharp burs to poke you or scratch the paint. I tried it out and the first thing I liked was the length of it. I was able to mount the camera in multiple spots and still had enough length to secure the other end. I would definitely purchase this again. The quality is top notch. I mounted the camera on the decklid and ran the cable inside the trunk and secured it with a D-ring to a bracket inside my trunk. Gomas customer service is top notch also. If you email them they actually respond in a timely manner. I would definitely do business with them again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-even-consider-worrying-about-the-cable-breaking">Don&rsquo;t even consider worrying about the cable breaking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Product, not worried of the cable breaking or anything like that. For the low cars such as mine, may have to double wrap around the mirror or else the camera may hit the ground if the suction cup comes lose, but better to have a longer cable you can make shorter then have one thats not long enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-10-dollar-insurance-program-for-your-gopro-ever">Best 10 dollar insurance program for your GoPro, ever!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lasso was a phenomenal addition to my GoPro Kit. After watching a friends GoPro do unintentional parkour on concrete at sixty miles per hour due to a suction cup failure, I wanted to ensure my GoPro did not suffer a similar fate. The item is obviously easy to use, and the coating over the solid steel wire makes it safe to drape over car parts, glass etc. My suction cup has not failed me at this point, but I&rsquo;m not super worried about that, thanks to &ldquo;Best Tether&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strong-quality-construction">Strong Quality construction</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>well constructed and strong. Deducted 1 star due to no clasp or other mechanism to attach it. I had to use a zip tie or other method to secure it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="piece-of-mind">Piece of Mind</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this so I could feel more comfortable with mounting my GoPro on the outside of my car. Luckily the camera stayed mounting, but I felt confident that the tether would have helped if the mount had of failed. The tether feels strong and quality made. It&rsquo;s easy to use. I found it interesting that some reviews mentioned that they thought it was too long, for me there were a few times I wished the tether was a little bit longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-great">Its great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cable is reasonably long, lightweight, strong, takes up a small volume, and has a nice coating to protect my stuff. It even looks good.</p>

<p>Works like a charm for tethering a GoPro to a moving car. The suction cup held, but I was confident the steel cable would hold the camera.</p>
