<h5 id="bose-is-the-best">Bose is the Best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I agonized over this purchase for six months. I looked at reviews, I watched videos, I read tech specs, and did shot after shot of tequila crying into the night begging God to help me! Okay the first three are true. They arrived in one day in a really nice package. I have worn them on several bike rides and gym visits. I sweat like a whore in church and they stand up to the punishment. They have never fallen out. Even when I&rsquo;m in full Rob Zombie metal thrash mode. I try to make them fall out and they will not.The app is nice and works perfectly. Also, I use Runkeeper and now I get heart rate data in that app. The sound is amazing just like all Bose products.I have Bose noise canceling headphones, a mini wireless speaker, and a Bose system in my car.</p>

<h5 id="bose-versus-jaybird-fight">Bose versus Jaybird - fight!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried various inexpensive wireless earbuds / headphones over the last few years, and have never found a pair that beat out my good old-fashioned wired earbuds. Well, I recently had the opportunity to try out both Bose and Jaybird wireless buds. Both are similar in price, have gorgeous packaging, and have similar features. Here are the results.SOUND- Bose: 10 of 10. Absolutely astounding sound quality. Simply the best I have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period.- Jaybird: 8 of 10. Solid sounds, fine for podcasts or casual music listening. Bass response is nowhere close to Bose, but with some equalizer settings on your device you can come closer. Competitive with most other nice earbuds I have tried.FIT- Bose: 7 of 10. Surprisingly good fit considering how HUGE the buds are. Seriously, these things are big. They apparently house the battery and electronics that power these (since they are wireless). But for their size, they fit fine with the included inner-ear pieces (several sizes included).- Jaybird: 9 of 10. Excellent fit. Tiny compared to the Bose product. These also include many options for earbud size and inner ear inserts that hold them in place, but they remain comfortable after several hours of constant use while running.FEATURES- Bose: 9 of 10. These have the charging port directly in one of the earbuds, which works well. You can download the Bose app, and amazingly you can even read your pulse from the buds! This is a fun and useful feature for various types of training.- Jaybird: 7 of 10. Has a separate little &ldquo;mini&rdquo; dock needed for charging. You can download an app for the device to adjust the sound and perform a few other &ldquo;minor&rdquo; functions, but I wound up deleting the app and just connecting normally via Bluetooth.So do I have a favorite? For daily exercise use I am gravitating to the Jaybird mostly because I prefer the fit and just do not care for the giant bud size on the Bose. But for travelling or listening when I&rsquo;m not active, the Bose wins out with superior sound.In summary, the Bose is a great product - recommended!</p>

<h5 id="extremely-comfortable-good-sound-wish-battery-lasted-longer">Extremely comfortable, good sound, wish battery lasted longer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Still the best bluetooth in-ear headphones of early 2017 (<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>). Let me explain.Well, first, I cannot believe there are so many raving reviews claiming these headphones to be the &ldquo;best I have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period&rdquo;. Um. Ignore Vine reviews. And then one-star reviews complaining about defective units &ndash; well, every electronics is prone to defective units, and Bose has some of the best warranty policies, so please.So you&rsquo;re thinking about wireless in-ear headphones. As of 2017, your two best options are Bose Soundsport Wireless and Jaybird X3. Here&rsquo;s how they compare:SOUND (Bose: <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>)&ndash; Very good and fun sound. Warm and slightly bass-heavy, although the lowest bass rumbles as well as harsh trebles are cut off (like most bluetooth headphones). I wish mids had more clarity, but I&rsquo;m nit-picking here. These aren&rsquo;t replacing my wired headphones, but if I&rsquo;m traveling, I can definitely enjoy music with these.&ndash; Jaybird X3 (<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>): These are slightly brighter-sounding headphones, with less bass impact but clearer mids and trebles. Still pretty good. These are closer to neutral, but high trebles are still rolled off. So it&rsquo;s up to personal preferences. I also think it depends on your ear fit, and if you can get a better seal than I did, then your experiences may vary (bass is the first thing to go with a poor seal).COMFORT (Bose: <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>)&ndash; I generally don&rsquo;t like to give perfect score to anything, but Bose really deserves a perfect ten here. This is the selling point of Bose. Despite the ugly bulky looks, the headphones are incredibly comfortable, and wires don&rsquo;t distract.&ndash; Jaybird X3 (<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>): These have average comfort, like most other in-ear headphones. Wings help a bit. Wires are heavy and tug on the ear pieces when I move around a lot. Overall, significantly less comfortable than Bose.PRICE (Bose: $149)&ndash; Bose is pricey. They&rsquo;re known to be pricey/over-priced, and discounts are hard to find.&ndash; Jaybird X3 ($99). These are definitely a great deal, and you can often find cheaper deals.OTHERS&ndash; Bose remote buttons feel weird to press. Buttons are big, not very clicky, and generally unpleasant to work with. Jaybirds feel better.&ndash; Battery life is fairly advertised at 6 hours. I get around 7 hours. I wish it lasted longer. Jaybirds are advertised at 8 hours but I get around 7, same as Bose.&ndash; Bose looks ugly, if you care about these things. Jaybirds look nicer. I personally don&rsquo;t care.&ndash; Bose provides a more useful case. Jaybird case&rsquo;s opening is too small and frustrating to use on the daily basis.Overall, Bose Soundsport Wireless is extremely comfortable and sounds great. I wish the battery lasted longer, but I don&rsquo;t think any competition (as of 2017) provides a significantly better battery life, yet. Until then, Bose is still the bluetooth in-ear headphones to beat.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-jaybird-and-beats">Better than Jaybird and Beats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great headphones for working out. Much better than the Jaybirds X2 and Powerbeats2 I had previously. They stay in the ear and are very comfortable. The sounds is awesome for bluetooth workout headphones. Enough bass for Rap/R&amp;B and rich mids for rock and pop. You may have a hard time with the tips if you have small ears. They come with multiple sizes,but the small may not be small enough for some.</p>
