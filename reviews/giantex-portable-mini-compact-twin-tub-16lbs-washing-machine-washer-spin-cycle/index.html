<blockquote>
<p>This little machine is amazing. I did several loads by pouring in the water using a bucket. My brilliant sister came up with a solution using a dollar store turkey baster! Just cut off the narrow tip, insert it into the hose. Cut an X shape into the top and push it into your faucet. You need to watch the water pressure but this soulution is easy, cheap and doesn&rsquo;t require plumbing skills.READ MORE</p>

<p> After a few months of hand washing, I was ready to quit! This is my review and demonstration of the Costway Twin Tub Washing Machine, sold through Giantex, available on Amazon. It&rsquo;s a wonderful little machine that&rsquo;s incredibly spacious and relatively quiet. It gets out even the toughest stains (my daughter loved yogurt and mac and cheese!) for 100 bucks.I was NOT endorsed for this video and I did NOT receive this item for free or at a discount. I reviewed it because I wanted to and I love spreading the word about good products that work and make women&rsquo;s lives easier! :-)READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does a wonderful job for a single person (although I think, this can be used for a couple and even for a small family). I gave 4 stars only because the water hose, drain hose and electric cord are very short. Also the water hose does not fit into faucet, so it required some engineering for me to make it work. Machine is very light weight and thus fairly portable. Hooking it up requires some DIY skills though. I created a small video to demonstrate how I use this washing machine.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="best-product-i-have-ever-spent-money-on">BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER SPENT MONEY ON!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG! I love this little washer. 11 years of going to the laundrymat and washing by hand in the tub in between trips. I am in love. I stayed up to 2am washing clothes yesterday, the day it came in. Dirty drawers never felt more like christmas. It holds a lot more than I expected. So far I have only used it up to the medium wash line, with the strength of the agitator I am afraid that filling it up to the high line might cause the water to spill out from under the lid. But (1) load washed 2 of my leggings size xl, 2 xl womens shirts, mens long johns, 2 boys school pants, 2 uniform shirts, 3 long footed fleece onsies for the baby, 5 t sirt onsies and about 8 pairs of socks&hellip; I probably could have fit a few more onsies in there, but I am still learning what works best as a full load. I even did a load with 1 pair of my husbands jeans (hes 6ft). 1 f his t shirts, a bunch of socks, about 4 onsies and some random socks. This I found since the jeans are heavy, you want to make a light load. I had to take a few onsies out because I felt it was too much strain on the agitator. The spin tub is small and you have to split the load up in 2 to spin dry&hellip; but the spin dry is fantastic. It gets so much water out. I swear I almost cried when I saw how clean the clothes came out and how dry they were left from the spin cycle.. NO MORE HAND WASHING AND HAND WRINGING!!! I set the washer on a bench and used the sprayer from my sink to fill up the water. This is a gravity drain tub, so the drain has to be lower than the machine. I use a 50 gallon sterilite storage tub to drain the water into, then dumped it in my bath tub. This is difficult, but I was so excited to use this thing, that I havent really thought through the whole &ldquo;where am I going to put it&rdquo; scenario. I think it would work best to get a sturdy storage rack for my bathroom and store it next to the tub, and use my shower sprayer to fill the it. I found the hose to hook it up to your faucet to be useless, didnt fit and its so narrow that it looks like it would take a while to fill that way. The largest wash set to the highest water level says it takes 46L &hellip; dude thats 23 - 2L pepsi bottles.. thats a lot of water. But anyway.. awesome product. If you live in an apartment, I would highly recommend to buy this to anyone.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="once-we-figured-out-how-much-water-to-put-in-it-things-worked-alright">Once we figured out how much water to put in it things worked alright&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We went from living on a third-floor apartment with laundry in the basement and across the building to a small duplex with free laundry. Unfortunately for us, the machines look like they are from the 1970s and have rust on all the lint wires, etc. So we ended up getting this machine for some smaller loads. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last, but when it works, it works great!Our first load was a disaster, the directions are awful and we actually appear to have put more water in than needed because water was leaking out the top sides of the bin. We contacted customer service who wanted us to mail it back! Right, because anyone is really going to pay a crap load of money out of their own pocket to return something this size! No way. We decided to give it another try or two. The second time I put less water in and thank goodness the leaking stopped. It&rsquo;s a fine balance with this machine, finding the right amount of clothing/water to put in. It does work better than I imagined it would, and we&rsquo;ve been able to do good size loads. If it lasts, it will be well worth the 100.00 we paid. If it mucks up in the next few weeks then we&rsquo;re better off at the laundry mat&hellip; This is a manual drain machine so it isn&rsquo;t easy. You may be dumping buckets of water down the tub drain like I am but for us it&rsquo;s worth it knowing we are washing our clothing in a machine that isn&rsquo;t 50 years old and only has our stuff in it!Okay, since the directions are awful, I&rsquo;ll give you a quick rundown of what they say to do here:1) Make sure spin dial is on soft or normal2) put in detergent3) Fill tub with water4) add clothes5) Close lid and turn time dial on for however long you want to wash them for6) When load is done, turn dial to drain and drain water out of washer7) Place clothing in spin dry machine and spin dry them for however long you&rsquo;d like8) Turn dial back to soft/normal9) Fill tub in washer again with water (NO detergent)10) Place clothing from spin dryer back in washing tub w/fresh water11) Close lid and turn dial on for however long you want to rinse-wash your clothes12) When done, drain13) Place clothing in spin dryer and spin dryThis is how I do it:1) Make sure spin dial is on soft or normal2) put in detergent3) Fill tub with water4) add clothes5) Close lid and turn time dial on for however long you want to wash them for6) When load is done, turn dial to drain and drain water out of washer7) Fill tub in washer again with water (NO detergent, but keep your wet clothing in)8) Close lid and turn dial on for however long you want to rinse-wash your clothes9) When done, drain12) Place clothing in spin dryer and spin dryREAD MORE</p>
