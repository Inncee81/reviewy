Product Description

Long the authority on propane camping stoves, Coleman steps up to the plate again with its two-burner PerfectFlow stove. Coleman&rsquo;s PerfectFlow appliances regulate the pressure of the propane to provide a consistent cooking performance without flaring or flickering. This steady fuel stream holds true even in cold weather, high altitudes, or when the fuel is low.</p>

<p>This Coleman propane stove sports 2 independently adjustable 10,000 BTU burners.
The stove is equipped with two 10,000 BTU burners, with independently adjustable flames that let you boil water on high (in a mere 4-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> minutes) while you simmer chili on low. The fuel is long lasting as well: with just a single propane fuel cylinder (sold separately), you can use both burners on high for up to an hour&ndash;more than enough time to prepare a weekend&rsquo;s worth of meals. Plus, the stove includes Coleman&rsquo;s Windblock side panels, which not only shields the burners for maximum heat, but also adjusts outward to accommodate larger pot sizes. Propane stoves are perfect for almost any social outdoor activity, including camping, hunting, tailgating, and backyard cookouts. The PerfectFlow stove measures 23.25 by 5.5 by 14.75 inches (W x H x D) when closed and carries a three-year warranty.
About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a &ldquo;no light, no pay&rdquo; clause&ndash;a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked&ndash;and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.</p>

<p>In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company&rsquo;s current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won&rsquo;t deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.</p>

<h5 id="hard-to-adjust-heat-due-to-gummy-valves-but-easy-fix-read-on">HARD TO ADJUST HEAT DUE TO GUMMY VALVES&hellip;BUT EASY FIX&hellip;READ ON</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The valves in this stove are a big source of frustration, BUT there seems to be an easy fix, and once done the stove is perfect&hellip;.just what you expect from Coleman. All you have to do is use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the knobs on the valves. Then unscrew the brass nut that secures it to the front of the stove. Now back out the valve stem using the knob and remove the stem that has two O rings and the brass needle valve. Take a clean paper towel and wipe the gunk or the valve lube off of the O rings thoroughly. I blame the lube for the problem. The rings were in good condition. I then applied a tiny amount of silicone based plumber&rsquo;s grease, but you have to be sure you don&rsquo;t use one that is petroleum jelly or it can ruin the rubber. I bought a tube for a few bucks on Amason. Then I twisted some of the paper towel into a point and swabbed out the inside of the valve, but don&rsquo;t leave any paper in there or you are in trouble. Don&rsquo;t use a Q tip either or the fuzz may come off in there. Here is link for the silicone lube:<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFUPC/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1I">https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFUPC/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1I</a> didn&rsquo;t put too much lube on the O rings, and with my fingers I wiped it around the rings leaving only a light coat. Then reassemble. Now the valves can be adjusted neatly and precisely to reduce flame for simmering and easier control. I don&rsquo;t know if the factory used a valve lube that gives the valve that rubbery feeling that makes it hard to set the flame precisely, but once I did this operation the stove is a pleasure to use. If it needs to be repeated the job takes only a few minutes with few tools. Hope everyone finds this post without having to go through the learning curve. Please give a thumbs up to save everyone some trouble. I changed my review now from 1 star to 4 star and think in the long run this is the best propane camp stove out there and will last longer than my Blue Rhino&hellip;which was good but the regulators flake out much too soon to be considered a good long term stove. BTW, this stove is for our outdoor kitchen (under the porch and not in the rain) and we use it almost daily.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-double-stove">Very good double stove.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Coleman Two-Burner Propane Stove is very good double stove. Because the heat is generated form propane, it can get very hot and able to cook faster. This is excellent for cooking in camping settings and sometimes in our back yard for dishes that require very high heat.A small 16.4 ounce propane tank lasts a really long time we found, although, with the right adapter you can use normal large propane tanks. Also, we like to put some non-slip tape on the bottom as it can get quite slippery during use. The fit and finish is medium quality, though, unlike the ones that used to be made in USA long ago.</p>

<h5 id="you-can-t-beat-a-coleman">You can&rsquo;t beat a Coleman</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t beat a Coleman. I bought this one for a gift for a friend, but it is identical to my own that I&rsquo;ve had for 25 years. It is without a doubt the best little propane stove out there. I originally bought it for those times that power failures happened and there have been dozens of those times. I put it right on top of my counter, pop on the little tank, and it&rsquo;s ready to go. Easy to use, easy to store, and next to no cleanup. I wouldn&rsquo;t be without it.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-stove">Great little stove!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first Coleman stove and it worked perfectly for me! The stove was easy to set-up and easy to lite. I also love the size. Not too big or small. Two burners worked perfectly for a coffee pot and a pan. This is a good stove for those wanting something light and portable.</p>

<h5 id="of-car-camping-and-don-t-need-to-be-packing-ultra-light-like-a-backpacker-this-is-a-good-camping-cook-stove">&hellip; of car-camping and don&rsquo;t need to be packing ultra-light like a backpacker this is a good camping cook stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do a lot of car-camping and don&rsquo;t need to be packing ultra-light like a backpacker this is a good camping cook stove. There are bigger more expensive ones you could buy but Coleman has been making liquid fuel versions of this stove since the mid-1950s and they&rsquo;ve been making the propane version for more than a few decades as well so they know what they are doing. For the price, this stove is hard to beat.</p>
