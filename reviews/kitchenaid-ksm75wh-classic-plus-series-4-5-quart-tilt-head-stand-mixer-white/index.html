<h5 id="easier-to-move-pretty-damn-powerful-for-its-size">Easier to move &amp; pretty damn powerful for its size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the large Pro model of this Kitchenaid. It is a wonderful machine. But it is heavy. Unless you have some place to keep it on the counter, or at least at waist level to lug it around, it is HEAVY to use. I read that people tend to concentrate on the wattage of the machine. More important is the torque&ndash;how the energy of the motor gets translated into working power.I really like the lighter weight and comparatively powerful motor of this Classic Plus mixer. I noticed that this is the model they use on America&rsquo;s Test Kitchen and Cook&rsquo;s Country on PBS. It has the right size bowl for the size batches I have been making lately. And my old grinder and pasta attachments work fine with it. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This is a lovely mixer that I traded for an Artisan because that one was red. I bought it to make cookies after my hand mixer started to smoke during a particularly intense doughing session. I used it primarily for that and pizza crusts. Things that can be mixed with a handheld whisk, I opt for that instead.Do you need a stand mixer? No, probably not, but it sure takes the grunt work out of stirring and kneading. It also mixes more consistently than I could by hand and classes up the counter.If you&rsquo;re set on a stand mixer, should you buy this one? Maybe. It&rsquo;s not designed for huge amounts of heavy dough or constant use. It&rsquo;s built well, but it&rsquo;s not an industrial machine. It audibly strains and thumps with a double helping of cookie dough (around 25 oz of flour) and while kneading wet, thick pizza dough. With that sort of load, there&rsquo;s no speed difference between setting 6 and 10, though of course you&rsquo;d only knead at setting 2 anyway.KitchenAid has some mixers that are ostensibly a bit stronger. They&rsquo;re all lift-style: instead of tilting the head back, the head sits higher and you raise and lower the bowl. I prefer the tilt-head style. The paddles never get out of the way with the bowl-lift, getting the bowl to lock in place is a jerky movement, and it takes up a lot of vertical counter space. What you do get for the extra cost of the Pro series is a better dough hook, a metal gearbox, more power, and a slightly larger bowl. Even these higher-power mixers will fall short of alternatives from Bosch and Electrolux for serious breadmaking, however.If you opt for the Artisan, you gain <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> QT of bowl capacity, a handle on the bowl, the splash guard, and color choices besides white. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s functionally identical to this model and about the same power. The splash guard in particular is a fiddly thing, you spill less just tilting the mixer up and dumping your ingredients in. I do think the larger bowl and the handle are worth something though (especially for double recipes), so the Artisan may be preferable for more than just the color.There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about Hobart units. Prior to about 1985, these mixers were made by Hobart, a supplier of industrial kitchen equipment. Later models are made by Whirlpool. There&rsquo;s some debate whether the new models are as good as the old ones, particularly in regard to the gearbox. My take is that if you can find an old Hobart (e.g., K4SS, K5-A, K5SS with a metal &lsquo;Hobart&rsquo; placard) and it runs well, it&rsquo;s likely to keep running well no matter what you throw at it. But it won&rsquo;t be as clean and may not fit certain new bowls, paddles, or attachments.New or old, these KitchenAid mixers are dead-simple to repair. The motor brushes are replaceable without dismantling the unit ($10 or so and hidden beneath the black circular covers), the speed governor is mechanically adjustable, and the gearbox is straightforward and easily accessible. This means that they&rsquo;re intriguing on the used market. People receive them as gifts and put them in the local classifieds with minimal use or minor flaws you can fix. Typical transaction prices are $125-$150, and I&rsquo;ve seen this mixer as low as $75. For new units, Kohls has them on sale quite often.Here&rsquo;s the full list of KA mixers (updated December 2016):KSM3311X - Artisan Mini* Tilt-head, 250W, 3.5QT metal, soft-startK45SS - Classic* Tilt-head, 250W, 4.5QT metalKSM75 - Classic Plus* Tilt-head, 275W, 4.5QT metalKSM95 - Ultra Power* Tilt-head, 300W, 4.5QT metalKSM96 - Ultra Power Plus* Tilt-head, 300W, 4.5QT metal handle, pouring shieldKSM150 - Artisan / Architect* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shieldKSM153 - Artistan Flex* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, flex beaterKSM155 - Artisan Design* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handleKSM160PS - Ultra Power* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handle, 3QT metal, pouring shieldKSM160APS - Architect* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, 3QT metal, pouring shieldKSM500 - Pro 500* Bowl-lift, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffRKG25H0X - Heavy Duty* Bowl-lift, 450W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKV25G0X - Pro 5* Bowl-life, 450W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKP26M1X - Pro 600* Bowl-lift, 575W, 6QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKF2622 - Pro 600 Design* Bowl-lift, 575W, 6QT glass handle, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKSM6521X - Pro 6500* Bowl-lift, 750W, 6QT glass handle, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffKSM7586P - Pro Line* Bowl-lift, 975W, 7QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffKSM8990 - NSF Certified* Bowl-lift, 975W, 8QT metal handle, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffKSMC895 - NSF Certified* Bowl-lift, 975W, 8QT metal handle, bowl guard, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffIf you&rsquo;d rather have a more powerful bowl lift mixer, KitchenAid&rsquo;s refurbished store often has the Heavy Duty Series for around $175 (if you Google a coupon code). It&rsquo;s a doppelganger for the Pro 5 and includes the superior spiral dough hook. Whatever model you buy, try to have it on (even with an empty bowl) for a few minutes at least once a week or two. The oil-leak problem occurs when the oil breaks down from disuse. If the mixer runs with any frequency, you&rsquo;ll never encounter it.</p>

<p>I was using a hand mixer that worked but left me a bit tired after making multiple pound cakes. Mixing ingredients for 5 minutes at a time over and over again became a bit much. There had to be a better way. These went on sale right before Thanksgiving last year and I decided to get one. I&rsquo;ve been very happy with how well this mixer works. Now my moist ingredients get mixed while I sit down and check my email. Life is good lol. If you bake a lot this is a good investment. It takes a lot of the strain out of baking if you have back problems. But note that it&rsquo;s heavy. You&rsquo;ll probably want to make as permanent spot for it on a counter. Happy baking!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Loving it so far but it did take about 2 treatments of baking soda and lemon juice to get the factory finish residue completely gone. Thought I was good to go until I tasted what I was making and it had a metal taste. Its better now and I&rsquo;m really happy with my mixer. I have been wanting one for a long time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for a KitchenAid. Solid, dependable, very powerful. I&rsquo;m using it so much more than I thought I would. The price of this special edition model was right, so we made the leap and I&rsquo;m so glad we did. It&rsquo;s a little bit smaller than the full sized one, which was important in our little kitchen because you don&rsquo;t want to have to take it off the counter to put it away. It&rsquo;s way too heavy for that. But it&rsquo;s worth making permanent space for because you will use it.</p>

<p>I finally purchased one for myself after having purchased two for parents years ago. These things are work horses and I&rsquo;m glad I finally treated myself. The price was just right and I expect to get my money&rsquo;s worth. Didn&rsquo;t want to make a $400 investment.</p>

<h5 id="but-i-loved-my-old-kitchen-aid-mixer">but I loved my old Kitchen aid mixer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have yet to use mine, but I loved my old Kitchen aid mixer. I am sure I will love this one. I got the white color this time. And I have to say that whomever packaged mine had greasy hands. When we opened the box, there was the white dome of my new mixer with dark, greasy fingerprints. ): Still, based on the performance of my beloved red Kitchen aid mixer, I am giving 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-never-go-wrong-with-ka">Can&rsquo;t never go wrong with KA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this so I could send it to my family in PR and I was VERY surprised that Amazon shipped this very heavy item to PR and that it actually arrived in one piece. I bought it knowing that it was a refurbished product and it worked like a charm when I tried it once I was back home. There were some warnings that the product might be with a few imperfections but if there were I didn&rsquo;t see them. The mixer got the job done when we needed it. Now my mom has it at her apartment.</p>
