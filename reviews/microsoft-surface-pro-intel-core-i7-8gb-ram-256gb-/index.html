<blockquote>
<p>&ndash;UPDATE&ndash;Disabling the auto screen brightness feature seems to correct the below issue.The device will reset at random times. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. After a review on reddit , I found many early adopters are experiencing the same issue. See thread: “Suspend/Poweroff at Random Surface Pro 2017 i5”.&ndash;Original Review&ndash;Received my Surface Pro yesterday and used it all evening. Here are my initial thoughts, hope they help.My device Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB, coming from an Ipad Pro.Pros:1. It’s a full PC. If it works on PC, It works on this.2. Ease of use. I love how it easy it is to load UHD video files. Playback is flawless. Never did get this working on Ipad.3. Fast and responsive.4. Build quality is premium. Love the new rounded edges.5. Near silent. It has a fan, but it’s not loud enough to remember it’s even there. I think the i5 doesn’t even have one.6. Battery life is really good. Again I haven’t done any official tests, but it lasted all evening on the “out of the box” charge.7. Screen resolution is crisp and bright. Looks great playing hi res videos.8. Expandable storage with a micro SD card. This is a no brainer. Get a clue Apple.9. USB port. Again, Apple WTF?Cons:1. I wish the bezel was a little thinner. It would be nice to have more screen real-estate.2. A little smaller than ipad pro.3. It gets a little warm. Not sure about thermal throttling. I haven’t tested. But it does get a bit warm holding in your hands after a while.4. While I was browsing the web, it lockup and screen went black, after a few seconds it auto reset. This happened just once. Didn’t happen again all night.Conclusion:I really love it. This is the device the Ipad Pro should have been. This is a truly awesome laptop replacement and I enjoy using it. The most versatile portal tablet on the market.</p>

<h5 id="surprisingly-good">Surprisingly good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the years I have bought many ultra books, tablets, laptops etc. and always had an element of disappointment. This is the first tablet/ laptop I have bought that has exceeded my expectations. When detached from the keyboard it really is a fine tablet and when attached to the keyboard is a good laptop for travel or occasional use in the home. I would not go as far as saying that it replaces my desktop (2 Hi Res screens etc.) but it comes closer than anything I have had before. Very fast, light and easy to transport with good battery life.</p>

<h5 id="core-i5-with-8gb-ram-definitely-worth-your-attention">Core i5 with 8GB RAM definitely worth your attention</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are 4 major improvements which I do like very much:1. Lack of cooling vents (Core i5 version is completely fanless now). Surface Pro is more tablet than a laptop and I glad that Microsoft managed to make it passively cooled.2. Low latency pen. The new Surface Pen doubles the previous generation&rsquo;s sensitivity. Latency drops from 45 milliseconds to just 21. The lower latency time, the more natural is a process of drawing. Creators who work with Pen will appreciate this improvement.3. The Surface kickstand is improved as well, you can now push it nearly all the way back. Surface Pro can be used at a 10-degree angle which is also a nice bonus.4. Support of Microsoft Surface Dial. This little Bluetooth Cursor is an awesome device, I glad that Microsoft extended support of Dial across the whole Surface lineup.What about the value? Well, I think that Surface Pro is still overpriced. But it works well, looks premium and definitely worth your attention.</p>

<h5 id="review-of-core-i5-version">Review of Core i5, Version</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I first have to say that I did not purchase my Surface Pro through Amazon. However, Amazon is pretty much the most popular place to read reviews before purchasing items. So I&rsquo;m posting my review here, in hopes it helps others make their decision.First the obvious. The device looks and feels like a premium item. The vent slots around the top edge are even less visible than on the previous model (Surface pro 4). Even though the edges are slightly rounder on the new version, I would not have noticed unless told about it.My core i5 model is fan-less, meaning COMPLETELY silent. You will not hear a peep out of this device. Definitely an improvement from the previous generation.I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised at how cool to the touch the device stays, even after hours of uninterrupted use. Definitely on par, or better than my ipad slim. I bought mine during my lunch hour from work. I came back to the office, plugged it in and ran through initial set up.The device was at about 40% charge when I pulled it out of the box. I then charged it to 100%, and proceeded to time the beginning, and end time for every use session. This way I could accurately measure the real world battery life with normal use.I used it for a total of 5 sessions in the first 24 hours, and got 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours of actual use time. In that time, I read and replied to e-mails, downloaded and set up all office 365 applications, played around in Onenote, then sketched with the pen for about an hour, watched a couple of hours of youtube videos, imported and tweaked some spreadsheets in Excel, used the pen to work out lots of math problems and used it to make several Amazon purchases. Then, when the device was down to about 3% battery, I charged it again for the second time. This time I turned off the keyboard&rsquo;s back light, because I&rsquo;m a touch typist, and rarely look at my keyboard even when in almost complete dark. I then clicked on the battery icon, and changed the device settings to &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo;. To my surprise, the device only marginally dimmed the screen brightness, but the result was that on my second charge, I got abut 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours of use. I could even go lower on the settings to &ldquo;Best Battery Life&rdquo;, and it would probably push it to about 10 hours of use. I just choose NOT to do that, because then my display would be too dark to be enjoyable.The device keeps its charge intact when turned off, and inside my messenger bag for several hours every day.After the 3rd full charge, I am getting consistently, between 6.5 to 8.5 hours, depending on what software I&rsquo;m running.I suspect that those manipulating large 3D creations in zbrush, or modo, will definitely see less battery hours than I.The kick stand is slightly less rigid than on the surface pro 4, but I see no wobble or any reason to feel insecure about it.The only reason I took 1 star from this review, is that after one week of use, now I have spotted a small point (The size of half a drop of water) on the screen, where I can see some faint back light bleed when on a completely black screen. Again, I can ONLY see it during the all black boot up screen, or if I REALLY look for it while watching movies with dark backgrounds, while on a room with all lights turned off. I cannot see this spot on any other circumstance. It is so faint, that I can&rsquo;t see it, even if I look for it during normal use. I&rsquo;m a hard nitpicker, and probably would have thought about exchanging my unit, if I had noticed this the first day. But now that all my accounts are synched, I&rsquo;ve downloaded all my applications and installed all my personal files on here&hellip; the hassle is not worth it. So, PLEASE check your screen as SOON as you boot it up for the first time, and you should be golden.To end on a happy note, I have to say that for a few days, I really contemplated getting the new Ipad pro instead of the surface pro.If you are a digital artist who ONLY wants a portable digital sketchbook, and you do NOT require the device for any serious work&hellip; then the ipad pro is probably the best option for you. Simply because the ipad pencil has a lower initial activation force for the pen. This makes it feel more natural when drawing. However, writing on either device feels quite similar. After a few days of comparisons, I had to move up to the Macbook pro as an alternative, because the ipad pro just didn&rsquo;t measure up to my personal and professional needs. But then I realized that the new Macbooks have NO legacy USB 3.0 ports, no Micro SD card slot, and only 2 USB C type ports. Welcome to dongles galore! I need my device to be as portable as possible. Having to carry around several adapter cables and dongles would really put a strain on my already cluttered bag. Not to mention that I would only be able to afford the 128GB model, which I know for sure is not enough for my needs. The 256GB on my surface pro, coupled with the ability to keep a 128gb SD cart permanently inserted in it for extra space, was just too good to pass up. Then I realized I would also lose the touch screen, and digital pen capabilities if I went with the Macbook pro. Next, the software compatibility issues between the MAC OS and some of the learning software that I use, meant that I would still have to install Windows on a partition of my Macbook pro. Then I would have to start dealing with itunes for my videos and audio files. No. Just NO. Too many negatives crept in, to the point where I felt that the Surface Pro was really tailor made for people like myself.In my case, I wanted a portable device that I could use not just for fun. But that I could use to take notes and draw graphs and images during lectures; use in work meetings as a digital white board while hooked to a projector; work out math/physics problems without having to waste paper; use to manipulate CAD or Photoshop images while on the go; compile and share PDFs or any other format work/school related documents, while having the ability to mark them up, highlight and share them easily; use for coding/programming; and that as an added bonus, could be used as a fun machine for watching movies and drawing/painting on the go.If you want a thin, sleek device that can REALLY replace your laptop, then the Surface Pro is the definite winner.In short, if you want an ultra portable device optimized for content creation, get the Surface Pro.If you want a portable device optimized for content consumption, then get the Ipad Pro.I have owned multiple phones, laptops, game consoles, portable game devices, both work and gaming computers etc&hellip;I&rsquo;m so happy with this device, that this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review for an electronic device ever.Good luck with your search.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I upgraded from my surface pro 3 i3 64gb to this new model and I notice the diffrence. The battery is much improved. I really like Windows Hello face recognition, it makes it faster to log into my computer. I also like that this surface is backwards compatible with older accesories. I bought the older type keyboard cover from the surface pro 4 and use it just fine with my new surface pro ( it was $50 cheaper than the new type cover keyboard).</p>
