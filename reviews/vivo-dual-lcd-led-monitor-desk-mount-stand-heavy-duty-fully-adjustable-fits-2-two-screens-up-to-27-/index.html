<h5 id="more-stable-than-setting-a-monitor-on-a-stand">More stable than setting a monitor on a stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have added the monitor stand to my stand up desk. At first, I used the 4” clamp and I liked that I was able to come up with a way to test this out. With the 4” clamp, the Height-Adjustable Standing Desk - VARIDESK Pro Plus 36 - Black could not go down all of the way, but I was ok with that. This weekend I drilled a hole in the top portion of the desk and attached the mount using the 4” grommet. Now the stand up desk is fully adjustable.When I ordered the mount, I didn’t realize that the 4” grommet would work for passing it through a desk with a hole in it. I think that is helpful feature for those of you that have a desk where you cannot clamp and don’t want to drill a hole.The monitor mount is more stable than setting a monitor on top of a stand. One of my old monitors did not have the VESA mount, so I left it on the stand. The old monitor would wobble and the new monitor would barely move.I really like that it is fully adjustable! I have two 24” monitors on it. I have offset the monitor mount to fit my desk configuration. It has allowed me to have the left monitor arm fully extended and then the right one it adjusted to be next to it. The included wrenches allow me to adjust the tension of the arms.I will try to add pictures with the new monitors on it. [Update - Added final photos]*** Please rate my review as &ldquo;Helpful&rdquo; if it helped you because it helps me too! My opinions are solely mine and are NOT influenced by anything other than the QUALITY and PERFORMANCE of this particular product. Thanks! ***</p>

<h5 id="design-change-with-no-warning-not-the-same-as-last-week">Design change with no warning - not the same as last week!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Vivo changed the design from very sturdy and easy to assemble to rather cheap and tedious to assemble. We have ordered these for our office several times and I have personally assembled at least 5. I got the good\solid design last week and this week I got 2 cheap ones. Shame on you Vivo for changing your product without informing your customers!The one I just set up is wobbly on the desk and I have trouble tightening the tilt so they keep leaning forward.Be aware that all the good reviews for this product were for items shipped prior to 11/23/2015.</p>

<h5 id="specks-of-dust-will-rotate-your-monitor">Specks of Dust will Rotate your Monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost good enough. I own two 24&rdquo; monitors and although the arms, pole and desk mount work about as I would expect, the rotation design is pretty bad. If a speck of dust hits the top part on the left or right side of one of the monitors, or your cat&rsquo;s tail brushes the monitor, the entire monitor begins to rotate (see provided picture). Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any feature built into the stand to change the tension on the plate that connects the monitor to the arm. Would love a solution to this.Edit: After a bit of problem solving, there is a DIY way of preventing the monitor from rotating. If you require your monitors to rotate, this isn&rsquo;t for you. I&rsquo;ve included two new photos that illustrate one method of preventing the bezel from moving on its own. It&rsquo;t not pretty, but it does work. Make sure the object you insert between the screw and the bezel plate is strong and has a bit of thickness to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="new-and-improved">New and improved.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The new model of the VIVO STAND-V002 is a clear improvement over its previous incarnation (which I also own). The older model did not allow you to remove the VESA plates, which made the installation of heavier monitors either a challenging solo job or one that requires a second person to assist. The new model allows you to mount the VESA plate on the monitor before you slide it into the rails at the end of the monitor arm. That is probably the single biggest improvement for this monitor stand. The cable management is a bit improved, too, and the cable loop on the stem also has slots for leaving the included Allen wrenches in them in case you want to make adjustments to the stand in the future.My only gripe with this stand is that the screws that they supply for use with monitors that have curved or glossy backs is that they seem to be a bit too long. I tried to mount my ASUS VE278Q monitor on this stand and even after the screws are all the way in, there is still a little bit of free play between the VESA mount and the cushioning spacers that they include. On the older version of the stand, there were a couple of washers that you could use to fill in the empty space, but even after cannibalizing the washers, there was still a little free play with the mount, so the monitor feels a little loose in the arm. Not the end of the world, and this hopefully only an issue with this particular model of monitor.The new version of the monitor stand also includes grommets, in addition to the clamp, for installing into an office desk with a pre-drilled hole. I didn&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<h5 id="great-monitor-stand-for-the-price-can-hold-one-or-two-monitors">Great monitor stand for the price! Can hold one or two monitors.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many monitor mounts out there from $30-$150 and more. The excellent reviews and size capabilities are what helped me pick this one. I wanted a mount which was capable of holding two 27&rdquo; displays. I was migrating from a single 22&rdquo; monitor (not mountable) and ordered this along with a ViewSonic 27&rdquo; monitor. This is a dual mount in case I decided i wanted another one, but I wanted to start with one. No problem. I received this mount and the giant clamp is adjustable for any desk size. Seriously, it must be able to do desks 4x thicker than mine. You can also convert the wire run in your desk into a connection point for this stand if you don&rsquo;t want to clamp it to the desktop. Since I&rsquo;m only using one monitor, I was able to remove the other arm so it&rsquo;s not just hanging there. Each arm has wire clips to make sure your wires aren&rsquo;t dangling from the monitor and instead run down the pole. These clips &ldquo;lock&rdquo; so the cables won&rsquo;t slip out. The one area for improvement is the nut which controls the mount angle is difficult to tighten. So if you adjust your monitor a whole lot, this seems to come loose enough for your monitor to let gravity take effect and swing it downwards a bit. My monitor is mainly static so as long as I don&rsquo;t play with it it&rsquo;s fine. If I needed 4 monitors and had a PC capable of it, I would buy another one.</p>
