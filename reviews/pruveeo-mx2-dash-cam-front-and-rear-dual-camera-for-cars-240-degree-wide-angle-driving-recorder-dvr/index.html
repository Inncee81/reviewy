<h5 id="great-inexpensive-double-camera-dash-cam-hard-to-beat">Great inexpensive double camera dash cam (hard to beat)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update number one million : keeping one unit that works even good at night, the other has a huge Halo issue with lights at night, good concept, needs a Lil better execution but for the price I&rsquo;ll keep one. After they contacted me about the HDMI output, they said they discontinued that feature without notice, which is how I hooked it up to my TV, now I have to go thru my laptop. It gets 3 cause it does the job, but many needed upgrades to features and future higher capacity card writers. Hope you get a &ldquo;good unit&rdquo; customer service is fast and helpful tho!Update : bought a second unit for my wife&rsquo;s car, it came with no HDMI output, which is wierd cause my first unit has one. It has it labeled and a spot for one, it just isn&rsquo;t there, a plastic outline. As you can see in the Pic I tried to remove the plastic, it&rsquo;s sealed, there is no plug behind it.Size is compact, VERY LIGHT, will not bounce, great picture. not noticeable from outside the car depending on mounting. It has awesome wide angle lenses that capture everything inside the car and great outside the windshield. I&rsquo;m very impressed with this, will purchase another for our other vehicle. Have yet to try it at night, but day quality is pretty darn good for the price! Will update if night quality isn&rsquo;t up to par, but I have no worries, if no update it works great at night too. Came with suction cup mount and two permanent mounts. Love it.UPDATE Night time driving : exterior facing camera only picks up what&rsquo;s in the light, EVERY SINGLE LIGHT HAS A HUGE Halo, street lights, car lights, every light which goes across the screen, assuming glare from the glass to the lens within the device itself. Inside facing camera was actually very good. For 50 bucks I&rsquo;m not gonna complain as it will still do the job at night if something were to happen.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-dash-cam-for-this-price-works-very-well">Very nice Dash Cam for this price. Works very well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is my first dash cam. It works very well. It has two lens with wide range for recording inside and outside. It is very convenient with the LCD Screen. It has several display patterns for the two lens. This very helpful. With this, I can easily adjust the angle for recording. I set up the loop recording for both camera with 1 minute. The file is about 200Mb for the high resolution camera, the other one is about 75Mb, so it is better to have the micro SD card with storage at least 8G. This device can automatically turn on /off when I start/stop my car. It is very convenient. And the charge cable is long enough that I can fix and hide it from windshield and through passenger side and avoid hanging cable. Good.</p>

<h5 id="good-image-quality">Good image quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really useful device. Featuring multi angle with two cams so that it can record both front and back. Last month my car got hit by someone and I couldn’t find who did that to me. Really upset to get it fixed by my insurance company and I still had to pay a little extra&hellip; Anyway, good product for a good price. Had it on for three days and have to say it’s doing a great job. Good quality as a recorder. If they offer free TF/SD cards, that would be perfect! Lol</p>

<h5 id="i-have-to-spend-a-pretty-penny-to-fix-it">I have to spend a pretty penny to fix it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My car is driving on the highway, The car next to it tire burst, The detached wheel hit my car, At that time, I didn&rsquo;t notice that the front bumper was badly distorted, Looking for insurance company afterward, I couldn&rsquo;t prove it was an accident, I have to spend a pretty penny to fix it. If I had a Car Driving Recorder , things wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten so bad. So I chose this Car Dash Cam Dual Lens 120 plus 120 Degree Wide Angle Car Driving Recorder, It can do that Loop Interval Recording to micro SD Card. Seamless recording for no gaps between recorded files. I am satisfied with the.</p>

<h5 id="great-double-cam-dash-cam">great double cam dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy with this dash cam. Installation was easy and the wire is completely invisible except where it plugs in. I was worried from other reviews that the mirror would be hard to see through but it is just as clear as the original mirror. The LED screens make it easy to see what exactly you are recording and the picture is good.</p>

<h5 id="installation-is-easy-all-the-parts-needed-is-included-in-the">Installation is easy, all the parts needed is included in the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dash cam is a way of life for cars nowadays. Installation is easy, all the parts needed is included in the package. Once installed, it will record automatically in a loop once you start your car and it will end when you stop the car. It has a microSD card to store your recording, which will be easy for you to transfer to your computer if needed. One thing that can be better i think is the quality of the picture.</p>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great purchase!!!</h5>
