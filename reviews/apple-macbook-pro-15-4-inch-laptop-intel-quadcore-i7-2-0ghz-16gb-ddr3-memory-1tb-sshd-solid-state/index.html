<h5 id="known-graphic-card-failure">Known Graphic Card failure.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This computer model is known for having graphic card failures, my graphic card went out after 3 weeks, the full refund cut off is two weeks. They offer replacement laptops but I rather upgrade and not deal with this again. I am an iOS game developer and i need a computer that can emulate powerful machines to test my games on iPad emulators and others. This computer has monster specs and appealed to me because I believed it had the power to run stimulations. The graphics card couldn&rsquo;t handle the workload and failed on me after 3 weeks. I would have liked to return the this laptop and upgrade to a machine that could handle this workload, but the return date was 2 weeks. Do not buy this computer if you plan on using it for heavy duty processes like video gaming, video editing, programming, photoshop or anything GPU heavy. Save your money and get a newer Mac. You waste alot of money on these Macs and you expect them to run like a $1000 computer. Please if you have the fund or can save up for a new model, please consider avoiding this machine.</p>

<h5 id="refurbished-mac-was-pretty-much-as-advertised">Refurbished MAC was pretty much as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Refurbished MAC was pretty much as advertised. Had Microscoft Office for MAC installed by local authorized Apple service entity at extra cost. Was informed that &lsquo;1 TB SSHD hybrid hard drive&rsquo; was not a good situation and would impact reliability so I spent extra $$ to have 512 GB solid state hard drive installed. When reading details of different refurbished MacBookPro offerings, I could swear that the laptop was listed as of Sept, 2014, and that originally unit was built in 2013. In reality, unit was built in 2010 or early 2011. Thus, I thought the pricing was a bit too high. Key test will be longevity. Have mixed emotions about my decision to go refurbished route. Time will tell, I guess.</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-beautiful-mac">Great quality, beautiful mac</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with this product. I have been a PC user my whole life, but I thought I would give Mac a shot, since I am a photographer &amp; videographer and I have heard great things about these computers. I was not disappointed! Photos look great and I can edit them quickly and nicely. Also, video editing is smooth.The computer works great, and is in a very good condition for being a 2011 model. The battery doesn&rsquo;t last very long but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to because of the price. It looks good (few scratches from normal use), sounds great (good speakers), looks great (beautiful screen image) and the size is just perfect. Item came with an original charger.I went to the Apple store in New York recently and saw that the newest Macbook that has all the specs that this one has, costs about $3000, so I feel that having the 2011 model for $1300 is actually a pretty good deal.The item shipped fast. I was scared it wouldn&rsquo;t arrive on time, because I had a flight and had to leave the house early. Thankfully, it arrived before I had to leave and was able to take it with me!The seller treated me really nicely and answered all the questions I had very fast. Overall, very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend.</p>

<h5 id="wicked-fast-performance">Wicked Fast Performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This absolutely fits the bill for what I need. The 16GB of RAM and SSD make this machine lightning fast. It is in more than excellent condition, and after loading all my Adobe programs (among everything else I use daily), this baby is passing every test! Shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged very well. I highly recommend using Double Dex MacBooks if you&rsquo;re looking for a new MBP without dropping a mortgage payment on one. I&rsquo;m VERY happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I searched and searched and searched for a computer for over 2 months and finally decided to purchase this one. I am very pleased up to this point. I do have to contact the company about an upgrade not going through because my account not matching and unable to connect to my wifi printer but other than that, it has been wonderful. I do everything on the computer so that says a lot.</p>

<h5 id="very-positive-experience-with-doubledex">Very positive experience with doubledex!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my new/almost MacBook!!! I am 70 and not technologically inclined so I miss the simplicity of my old MacBook, but I am astounded by all this newer one can do.Most important however is my communication with doubledex. I had a minor issue with the computer and called doubledex. The young woman who answered the phone completely understood what I was talking about and recommended some procedures to correct the problem. It took some time, but she was patient and kind. As an older untechy person it can be frustrating talking to a tech person who has little tolerance for communicating with someone living and thinking at a much slower pace. Thank you Mariam.BTW if we had not been able to fix the problem over the phone she was ready to have me send it back to them without any argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-laptop">Great Laptop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great laptop, well equipped to handle most everything you can throw at it. I use it as my personal laptop/portable virtualization testbed, and the hyper threaded i7, 16 gigs of ram, and 1TB of hard drive space are spectacular for that purpose. The performance of this machine with 10.10 (Yosemite) is great. Also, the hybrid drive is just fine, and It should not have any impact on the reliability of the computer. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a MacBook that doesn&rsquo;t want to spend full MacBook money.</p>

<h5 id="doubledex-exceded-their-warranty-promise">DoubleDex Exceded Their Warranty Promise</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product that I received worked well for 8 months, but then had a catastrophic failure in which it would not boot properly. The folks at DoubleDex were amazingly responsive to my issues. They worked with me, listened to my concerns and helped me decide my best course of action. Ultimately, I was able to return the computer to them and have it fixed for only the cost of my shipping it to them. They expedited the work and had it returned to me in a very reasonable amount of time and it now works even better than it did when I originally received it.</p>
