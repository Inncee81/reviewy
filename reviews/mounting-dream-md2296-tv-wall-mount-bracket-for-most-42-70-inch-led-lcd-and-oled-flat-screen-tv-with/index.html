<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="quality-strength-ease-of-installation">Quality, Strength, &amp; Ease of Installation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well built. Very strong. Super easy to install. Took me all of 10 minutes to install this unit to a wall with a 49&rdquo; tv. Not joking. The tv I mounted had a 300 x 300 Vesa pattern, so I was able to use x-plate with out the vertical and horizontal cross members. I am sure that saved time, but maybe and extra 15 minutes max. My Vizio M492i-B2 tv came with M6 x 8mm screws, so I used them instead of the ones supplied by Mounting Dream. However, there a multiple sizes and lengths of screws along with spacers to accommodate most Tv&rsquo;s in its range.I have installed roughly 5 different types of TV mounts from 32&rdquo; tv to 65&rdquo; tv and the mounting dream was by far the absolute easiest that I have installed to date. I would buy this again before any other mount and highly recommend it.Note to Mounting Dream: Since this unit is so well constructed of heavy guage steel, it did make holding the unit to the wall to mark the drill holes somewhat of a challenge. I strongly recommend that you include a paper template that can be taped to the wall and used from drilling the mount holes, in the case that the installer does not have a second set of hands to hold the mount securely while marking.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-70-vizio">Perfect for my 70&rdquo; Vizio!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount did everything I wanted. It holds my Vizio 70&rdquo; tv perfect and still pulls away from the wall for easy access. Installation was simple and came with all necessary hardware. Wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to purchase this tv mount again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-durable-versatile">Simple, Durable, Versatile</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This device has duel swing arms. This is an advantage for some people and advantage for others. It is strong, durable, and simple. This TV mount would appear quite capable of exceeding by double its stated carrying capacity. Even if it broke all of the repair parts would be readily available at the local hardware store. The depth of travel that the TV can achieve (being pulled away or pushed back to the wall) is the major selling point here. It allows the TV to come out far enough from the wall that a 65 - 70 inch TV can complete a full 45 degree swing each direction if nothing is in its path of travel. Bonus: it comes with a free HDMI Cable.Here are quick setup instructions. If the TV or monitor being mounted fits the base place already equipped, then you are good. Undo the two Allen bolts at the back of the plate, mount to device with included combinations and bolts that fit your device, then mount stand base to studs and re-attach plate &amp; monitor. Being sure to put the Allen bolts back in after hanging the plate. Make sure not to mount plate on TV upside down, this is a gravity based rig. If your TV is too big ( TV mounted in my case a 100lb 65in) then make a square mount using the B &amp; C steel arms. Attach to TV. The mounting plate will bolt to the square that is bolted to the TV. I mounted this TV by myself, but wished for help. At this point the TV is very heavy with so much extra steel and very hard to maneuver onto the swing arms properly. Get help, do it with 1 or 2 other people. Falling TV&rsquo;s kill more people than sharks, or so i have been told.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-super-heavy-duty-wall-mount-bought-two-of-them">Fantastic, super-heavy duty Wall Mount - Bought two of them!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fantastic, value priced, but HEAVY DUTY wall mount. I originally bought it to mount my 52inch Sharp LC-52LE640U LCD tv on the wall in the bedroom. ( This TV has the 600 x 400 VESA mounting holes.) My experience was so good that I bought a second one for my bigger LG 65-Inch LED (model TV65UH6150) which, oddly enough, used a smaller 300 x 300 VESA mounting pattern.The box comes with all of the mounting hardware you need, including a wide range of bolt, washer and spacer sizes, great instructions and a mounting template. Even I couldn&rsquo;t screw this up!Initially, I was a little worried as I would be mounting this onto the old, solid walls of my NYC apartment, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the TV mount would hold up. But Mounting Dream provides 4 pretty decent sized bolts, I think M16 x 2.0 inch bolts, with matching Toggler Alligator anchors. Once I had the unit mounted, my worries were alleviated. This thing is NOT moving!Putting the mount up is super easy, as they include a cool little &ldquo;template&rdquo; with a mini &ldquo;level&rdquo; which you affix to the template. Once you tape the template onto your wall (the template even comes with the backing tape!) you just have to drill the holes. The instructions even told me what size drill bit to use! No measuring, no guessing! Perfect the first time!After mounting the second unit on my livingroom wall, for my bigger LG tv and watching tv for a week, I decided that I wanted to change the position a little, to bring the unit down a bit. (In addition to using a smaller mounting pattern than my Sharp tv, the LG&rsquo;s mounting bolt were on the bottom of the TV, which pushed the TV up higher. With the Sharp, the mounting wholes were up higher, so the TV &ldquo;hung&rdquo; low.) To that end, I was worried about reusing the plastic anchors so I looked online to see if I could buy some. These things were not cheap. ($17 for a 4 pack.) So, I reached out to Mounting Dream and explained my situation and they immediately sent me out a new set of bolts and anchors, free of charge!!For the price, build quality, customer service, ease of installation and various mounting options provided, I HIGHLY recommend this product!</p>
