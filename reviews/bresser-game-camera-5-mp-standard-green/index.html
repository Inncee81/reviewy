<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="too-cheap">Too cheap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Poor battery life, picture quality is not great and the buckle on the strap was cheap and broke the first time I used it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very impressed for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="also-good-as-a-surveillance-cam">Also good as a surveillance cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received this yesterday. PROS: Small, doesn&rsquo;t stand out. Camera setup is &ldquo;So easy, a caveman can do it&rdquo; (open access door, insert 8 &ldquo;AA&rdquo; alkaline batteries and your choice of Micro SD card up to 32 Gb, strap it on, turn it on, close access door). Can review images on screen on front of camera - no need to remove it or the media card. Motion sensor picks animals as small as a cat. Nice daytime photos. Inexpensive, appears to be well made. For surveillance use, you don&rsquo;t need to run wire for power and picture, no DVR needed. CONS: NO TIME STAMP. NO VIDEO. Night shots &ldquo;wash out&rdquo; close up unless you cover some of the LEDs with electrical tape. No adjustments for resolution, shutter speed, or reset time - while motion sensor is sensitive, there is a lag before the first photo is snapped - doesn&rsquo;t necessarily keep shooting as long as subject stays in frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-too-bad-for-the-price">Not too bad for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this at Walmart for $30. I have never used game cameras and this is my first year hunting. I wanted something that could tell me if I had anything coming into my food plot. I have not been disappointed. It takes pretty good pictures. As others have mentioned, there is no time/date stamp. I didn&rsquo;t really care at first, but now that I have some deer coming around I will upgrade to one that does. Do not go with what the package says, IT TAKES A MICRO SD CARD. I had this mounted for 3 months and it took about 800 pictures, the batteries are still at full charge. I did change out the strap as the one supplied broke the first time I mounted it. It is pretty sensitive as I had a lot of pictures of just leaves moving. I think the biggest disadvantage to this camera is the slow trigger speed, but again I just wanted to see what was coming around. I have found that if you take the card out to download the pictures, you have to release the battery compartment to reset it. No biggie. I like the screen to see what the camera is pointed at before it sets. I have had no issues with water as this has been on the tree during several multiple inch rain events. I would recommend this for the beginner or one who just wants to see what&rsquo;s out there.</p>

<h5 id="read-the-directions-and-here-are-some-more">Read the directions and here are some more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The directions actually do let you know what to do, but are not as clear as they should be. If you read the complaints of most, they are mostly -1.no date stamp- but it is specified there is no date/time stamp2.washed out picture- don&rsquo;t take the pics with walls or close objects that reflect the IR right in front of it- BTDT Take the pic outside and it works fine- it is a trail camera. It will work inside, but test the location to make sure you do not get a lot of reflection.3.starts blinking or does something weird- usually because you do not wait for it to complete a sequence, especially after viewing pics on the camera. it takes a while after viewing to reset to its normal condition. If you run into that problem, pull the battery pack and it should reset.Some things, like putting in an sd card, are in the directions but we tend to treat them as we would any sd card and immediately use it. It will not be recognized if you do. Give it time and all will be well.It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. In just three outings I have recorded a deer, three raccoons and a fox. I am trying to locate a woodchuck (which is why I bought it) and having a lot of fun in the search. All for $20 (at Walmart and now Amazon).</p>

<h5 id="not-a-bad-little-camera-for-the-price">Not a bad little camera for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found this at a lesser price on Walmart.com complete with a 64g memory card. While the memory card isn&rsquo;t compatible with the camera, the photos are of fairly decent quality for the price range (less than $35 for the whole &ldquo;starter kit&rdquo;). I had a 32g memory card on hand and swapped it out.For a &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; camera, it does the job. You have to angle the camera upward, however, to keep from getting a glare from the infrared flash. But, as you can see, I managed to capture a doe using one of the trees for a licking branch.</p>

<h5 id="i-bought-12-and-every-one-was-defective-do-not-waste-your-time">I bought 12 and every one was defective. Do NOT waste your time.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are total garbage. I bought 12 from Walmart last month when they were $20 each. Literally every one of them were defective. ALL of them were defective. I spent hours putting them up, spent significant money on batteries and memory cards. In the two weeks I had them up, they took about 5500 pictures total. Only 22 were good! Every other picture had any where from 50 to 95% of the picture filled in with a color (the photo was blocked out). This was not an issue of a bad memory card as I am using the exact same 16gb card in my two Spypoint cameras with zero issues. You need to save your time, money and sanity and by something that works. These are Chinese garbage.</p>

<h5 id="some-test-photos-i-took-of-me-walking-by-in-my-yard-have-been-really-good-for-this-price-point">Some test photos I took of me walking by in my yard have been really good for this price point</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these because of the price point. I have several other cameras that display date/time/moonphase. This one only takes photos but I knew that by reading reviews on here.Some test photos I took of me walking by in my yard have been really good for this price point, as shadows and color show up well, even individual blades of grass can be seen.I bought these because I just purchased a 50 acre property and want them to scout for me. The property recently belonged to an elderly woman and I doubt she ever stepped foot on it, so I&rsquo;m sure people have been hunting and trespassing without permission for the last decade.I bought these cameras to A. Scout for potential game and animals, B. See potential trespassers, and C. If those trespassers steal the camera, it&rsquo;s a $20 camera and not a 3 digit price tag reconyx.I&rsquo;m glad these cameras are available on the market, you won&rsquo;t beat this price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poorly-made">Poorly made.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these and they never worked out of the package.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>work great until dusk, only get dark pics, good night pics-clear</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-trailcam">Great little trailcam.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price this takes great pictures and has a great sensor. My 2 expensive cams took 28 pictures together, this one took 480. No timestamp, but this is a basic cam.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-but-good">Cheap but good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these cameras because they where cheap . Got to say without timer u get lots of pictures but they are as clear as my expensive ones .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great price</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-throwing-20-in-the-toilet-and-flushing-it">Like throwing $20 in the toilet and flushing it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Complete and absolute junk! You didn&rsquo;t really think you could get a game camera for $20 did ya? I did and lost $40 for 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">Don&rsquo;t Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought one 4 months ago and it&rsquo;s already dead. Not waterproof during rain storms. Filled with water screen and lights fogged up. Doesn&rsquo;t taken night shots when it did work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-for-price">Not bad for price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just bought this from Wal-Mart on clearance for $15. I was surprised it needed 8 AS batteries but it is supposed to last 2-4months so we will see.</p>
