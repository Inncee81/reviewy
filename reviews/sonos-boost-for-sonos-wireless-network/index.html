<h5 id="it-worked">It worked!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using a Sonos system consisting of 6 play 1&rsquo;s and a bridge for several years. It has always sounded incredible and performed flawlessly. Several months ago, I agreed to become a beta tester for Sonos in their new Sonos/Alexa integration. Wow, what a mistake! Ever since my first download of beta software, I have experienced a very unstable system which is prone to dropping speakers off the system. For no apparent reason, they may, or may not, rejoin. My awesome system has become an aggravating, difficult to use, frustrating mess! I even went so far as to remove the new software and quit the beta test. That made no difference. So I moved the entire system to a different router with absolutely no performance improvement. I was at the end of my rope, and very unhappy after all the money I have spent on this system.Then, I read that some users, with complaints similar to mine, had solved the negative issues with a Sonia Boost. I figired it was worth one last try to fix my system. The Boost arrived today and I installed it per the instructions. Initially, it seemed to work just great. Then, all of the sudden, it dropped all but one of the speakers, exactly as I have been experiencing for months. I was really unhappy at this point. So I re-joined each speaker a second time. WOW!! Now everything is working perfectly. It has been up for 5 hours without any problem.It&rsquo;s a shame that you have to buy a $100 addition to your system to get it back to where it was for several years, but it works. I am guardedly optimistic that it is fixed and I have my wonderful system back.</p>

<h5 id="best-sonos-update-ever">BEST SONOS UPDATE EVER!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Sonos Bridge died after 14 years of service. I called Sonos and they instructed me how to update my software to eliminate the Bridge and run the system on Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, my Sonos controllers would not work, so I purchased the Boost. What a great product. My entire Sonos system now responds instantly to any command from any room. For 14 years I learned to accept a slight delay in the system when entering commands. This product eliminates that issue. I highly recommend this to anyone still using a Bridge with Controllers. If you don&rsquo;t use the Controller, you can just go with Wi-Fi and your phone or tablet. Either way, you will be thrilled.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but">works but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our sonos system was working fine for years then the recent firmware upgrade seemed to throw a spanner in the works. The system kept hanging, I got insufficient network speed messages etc. My understanding is sonos is now trying to make the sonos work on both the sonos own internal network and the home wifi network. With mixed results!Anyway having invested a fortune on the sonos system, 2 play 2, 6 play 1, 1 play 5, 7 connect amps, etc I was very upset it was all falling apart, not to mention the ear bending on a biblical scale from the wife for wasting so much time and money on an unstable system. ( she seemed to have forgot the years of trouble free service we managed from sonos before). Anyway last ditch attempt to sort it out was this sonos boost, if it failed it was all going to eBay. So far it&rsquo;s only been a week and it all works! I give it 4 starts because if you ask me it does seem odd that a perfectly good system goes to pot after some sonos upgrades and suddenly sonos comes up with a product that will sort it out. Had they not messed with it in the first place then there would be no need to buy it! Though in fairness we can now get a sonos unit in the masterbedroom, before it was always a dead spot.</p>

<h5 id="great-addition-to-my-sonos-system">Great addition to my Sonos System</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was about ready to return my initial Sonos system. I had all sorts of problems with drop outs with the back speakers and the subwoofer. I ended up purchasing the BOOST and it made a world of difference. Everything works as expected and the quality of the whole system is unbelievable. If you have many barriers in your home that might reduce the quality of your wireless signal, go and purchase this product. I found that the &ldquo;extenders&rdquo; used by many wireless products simply don&rsquo;t work well with Sonos. Just get this product and call it good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wouldn-t-buy-again">Wouldn&rsquo;t buy again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a lot of wifi interference in my apt and in the complex. I thought this would significantly improve the drop signals with the connect that I had setup. Unfortunately, the Sonos Boost did not help much and in some cases, the drop rate was higher. I tried all three channels and 6 seems to be the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solved-our-problems-with-intermittent-connectivity">Solved Our Problems With Intermittent Connectivity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as the BOOST was designed to do, this unit has olved all our problems with intermittent network connectivity when we experienced while our multi-room SONOS speakers were connected directly to our wi-fi network.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-but-a-bit-difficult-to-set-up">Works Great, but a Bit Difficult to Set Up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After I moved to a new home my Sonos system with three Play5 units tended to cut out. After a lot of investigation, my signal was dropping. I discovered that with a BOOST, Sonos would set up a mesh system on a separate network. The unit works well , but I had to spend an hour with a Sonos tech to discover that interference from my previous wifi was causing the BOOST not to connect. In the end it does work as advertised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-notice-any-improvement">I don&rsquo;t notice any improvement.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t help improve audio streaming as advertised. I called Sonos help and they confirmed it was setup correctly. Can only run one zone at a time, bought a second router, just for sons, and that helped more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wasted-my-money">Wasted my money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it and found out afterwards I didn&rsquo;t need it. Wasted my money.</p>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the Job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the job. Wanted the Boost to connect to a wireless speaker outside the house on a patio area. Before the speaker would cut out. Now with the Boost it does not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I needed to reach hard to reach wifi area in house.</p>

<p>I didn’t order via amazon as I needed it ASAP. I’ve had my Sonos playbar, sub and 2 x play 1s for a few years and originally I had the old bridge and everything worked&hellip;</p>
