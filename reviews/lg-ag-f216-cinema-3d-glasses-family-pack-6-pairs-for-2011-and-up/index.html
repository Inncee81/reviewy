<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="adult-and-clip-on-glasses-are-good">Adult and clip on glasses are good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this with anticipation of having people with a variety of needs to want to watch our new 3D TV. The adult glasses are light and fit comfortably. The clip-ons work great also. The two childrens glasses are extremely small and too small for my 5 yr old who is tall for his age. My 8 and 5 yr old both use the regular glasses and the only time the children glasses will get used is with very small children.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-variety-starter-pack-for-the-lg-cinema-3d-televisions">Great variety starter pack for the LG Cinema 3D Televisions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I got the LG Cinema Screen 55LM6700 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV I knew I had to get my hands on some better 3D glasses than what the TV came with. I have two children that already wear everyday glasses and they looked funny and uncomfortable wearing 3D glasses on top of their regular glasses. This variety pack was the answer. Now they can just clip on the 3D glasses to their own glasses and watch the movies in comfort. We are a family of 5 so we all already claimed our own. My husband has claimed the black pair, two that wear glasses called the clip-on and our youngest son has the children&rsquo;s size. Of course I took the white pair. Each set comes with their own protective fabric case/sleeve and cleaning cloth which is a plus. I keep the glasses in the original cylinder box they all come in because it makes a very nice container to keep them them in and not get lost.Overall nice variety pack at a good value.</p>

<h5 id="these-rock">THESE ROCK!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have and LG 3D tv that came with 4 glasses. Since it&rsquo;s just my husband and I I put off ordering this set for a few months because they weren&rsquo;t really necessary. However, I realized I wanted to be able to invite my sisters in law and families over whenever I wanted to to watch movies in 3d and as that includes 3 kids, I finally pushed &ldquo;order&rdquo;.I am SO glad I did. Just a warning, the childrens glasses are SMALL. They are perfect for my 2 year old niece who LOVED having glasses her size. They were a little tight on my 7 year old niece, so she ended up using the women&rsquo;s glasses which are much smaller than the ones that came with the TV.I LOVE the regular glasses. They are sooo much nicer than the black plastic ones that came with the TV. They are also smaller, so I commandeered them as mine.The clip ons are great if you have people in your family who wear glasses. Now my hubby can watch a 3d movie without having to go put his contacts in, it&rsquo;s much more comfortable this way (the other alternative was to wear the 3d glasses over the REGULAR glasses, which sucks).They all work as well, if not better, than the ones that came with the TV. I can&rsquo;t reall say how well the little kid ones work since the only person that used them is 2, but she seemed to love them.I also LOOVVEEEDDD how they came packaged. They come in a nice black heavy cardboard tube, and each pair come in it&rsquo;s own little cloth pouch. I ended up taking everything out of the pouches and putting two pairs of glasses in each pouch, so I could also store the 4 glasses that came with the tv in the pouches/cardboard tube. All in all, I fit the original 4 glasses that came with the TV along with the 6 glasses that come with this set in the cardboard storage tube and they all fit perfectly. It&rsquo;s a much nicer way of storing them than the generic flimsy cardboard boxes most of thse come in.All in all, I don&rsquo;t regret this purchase at all. I&rsquo;m mad it took me this long to push order!!</p>

<h5 id="quality-3d-passive-glasses">Quality 3D Passive Glasses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Packaging:This package includes 2 Clip-on glasses, 1 pair for her, 1 for him and 2 for the children. The packaging for these glasses are descent to say the least. They come individually wrapped in their own pouch and each with a wiping cloth. The major negative draw back is the pouches are not labeled, so you will have to pull out the glasses to see which one is which. The holder that the glasses come in leave a little to be desired, feels like the glasses are jam-packed in there.Quality:These glasses are better quality then the ~$5 passive glasses you can purchase and are far more superior then the movie theater glasses. The glasses are more comfortable because they contour to the shape of your head/face instead of the cheaper glasses that are flat on the sides and front. If you wear glasses, you may find that the clip on pair may be comfortable then the ones that are supplied in the movie theaters.Overall:For $65, this item may be a bit high priced, but if you enjoy watching 3D movies or games on the regular. I would say invest in a good pair of glasses. As for quality of the 3D movies, it won&rsquo;t matter if you use the cheaper pair or these more expensive ones, the movies will look the same.</p>

<h5 id="clip-on-and-adult-glasses-are-good">Clip On and Adult Glasses are good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased this I didn&rsquo;t look closely enough at the product description and thought that I would receive 4 &ldquo;normal&rdquo; sized glasses and 2 clip ons. So i was a bit suprised to find the childrens glasses inside but thats on me so no star will be docked for that. The childrens glasses are much smaller so they simply won&rsquo;t do as a stand in if you run out of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; sized glasses. The plastic found on the childrens and the clear adult glasses is a bit thicker than those that come with my LM557600 so they feel better on the face and don&rsquo;t require bending to keep in shape. However being an additional purchase one would think they would be a bit more styleish.The metal glasses are a &ldquo;frameless&rdquo; style but feel so much better than any of the plastic ones and I wonder why two metal frames weren&rsquo;t included instead of one metal and one plastic. I actually contemplated bringing them to the theater to use. Don&rsquo;t fall alseep with them on though since there is no protection on the side of the lens to keep them from bending.My wife uses the clip-ons for her glasses which she loves using much more than having additional glasses over her set. The build quality of the hinge used to clip on to the glasses seems good so I don&rsquo;t worry about them failing anytime soon. The lens are thinner than glass so there is some flex when flipping up and down and you must actually touch the lens to do so.As a nice touch all the glasses come in cloth bags and there are several lens wipes included which are necessary with the clip-ons to wipe of fingerprints from flipping up and down.</p>
