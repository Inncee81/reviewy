<p>Gently Cleans Teeth with Sonic Technology
Unlike a manual toothbrush, the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 uses powerful Sonic technology to clean teeth with up to 31,000 movements per minute. These sweeping motions drive fluids deep into the tight spaces between your teeth and along your gum line, resulting in a cleaner, healthier mouth.</p>

<p>Angled Neck and Contoured Bristles for Comfortable Use
With a unique angled neck and contoured bristles that correspond to the natural shape of your teeth, the Sonicare Essence 5300 delivers a thorough, comfortable brushing experience. The angled neck provides optimum reach for the bristles, which have extra-soft rounded ends that gently massage your gums and go deep between teeth to remove plaque.</p>

<p>Easy-Start and Smartimer Simplify Brushing
The Essence 5300 makes it easy to care for your oral health. You need to apply only light pressure when using this toothbrush&ndash;the Essence 5300 will do the brushing for you. For further convenience, the Sonicare Essence 5300 features an Easy-start option that gently increases the toothbrush&rsquo;s power over the first 12 uses, so you can gradually adjust to the Sonic technology.</p>

<p>The Essence 5300 also features a Smartimer to keep you on track. The Smartimer encourages you to brush for a full two minutes, the time recommended by dental professionals. If you wish to pause or stop brushing during the two-minute cycle, just press the power button. If you press the power button again within 30 seconds, the Smartimer will pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>Two Weeks of Power on a Single Charge
After a full 24-hour charge, the Essence 5300 will provide approximately two weeks of typical use (two minutes of brushing, twice a day). A convenient recharge indicator on the brush displays the available battery life and blinks when you need to recharge.</p>

<p>Because the Essence 5300 can last two weeks between charges, you can leave its charger at home for most of your travels. A travel case and hygienic travel cap are included for further on-the-go convenience.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box
Brush handle, E Series brush head, brush-head holder, charger base, travel case, and travel cap.</p>

<h5 id="put-your-dental-hygienist-out-of-a-job">Put your dental hygienist out of a job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. You wet the brush, you squirt your favorite paste on the brush, you begin ultrasonically brushing your teeth, THEN you turn on the shower to wait for it to warm up. See, when you&rsquo;re waiting for the water to heat, you&rsquo;re ultrasonically brushing your teeth, saving precious morning time, and cleaning the living crap out of your teeth.Now, here&rsquo;s an important bit. When you depart the shower, you take your brush off the base thingie so your wife doesn&rsquo;t go all nuts on you for the billionth time, stick your brush head on a metal bit of the mirror (it&rsquo;s magnetic) then put the base on the sink. The brush head dries out all nice and high, nobody can reach it to use it, it can&rsquo;t possibly fall off into the commode and it prolongs the brush and base by letting it dry out a bit. What&rsquo;s not to love people. Clean teeth. Magnets. Happy wife. Seriously, people. it&rsquo;s all good.</p>

<h5 id="recommended-by-my-dental-hygienist">Recommended by my dental hygienist</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>On my last trip to my dentist, the dental hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I have been bordering on gum disease for several years, partly because I don&rsquo;t floss often enough, so I got the usual lecture about flossing, plus a recommendation to get the Sonicare. I went home and ordered one from Amazon, and I haven&rsquo;t regretted it. I have used electric spinbrushes for years, but the Sonicare is a completely different experience, since it uses high-frequency vibrations. It&rsquo;s definitely better at removing the stains I get from drinking hot black tea and eating red grapes (my favorite snack). And my gums actually tingle after a brushing. My next visit to the dentist is coming up in a couple of months, and I expect/hope to get a better report on my gums.One note: Philips sells a number of different kits for the Sonicare, but the hygienist recommended that I get the basic kit. The more expensive kits have more bells and whistles, but the toothbrush itself is the same.My wife is getting jealous of my Sonicare, so I&rsquo;ll probably be ordering a second brush soon. That&rsquo;s okay, because the brush part is removable and replaceable.One feature that I really like is the AC charger, since - unlike the spinbrushes I&rsquo;ve had - I don&rsquo;t have to change batteries every few weeks.Two thumbs up for the Sonicare toothbrush.</p>

<h5 id="great-cleaning-power-but-needs-quadpacer">Great cleaning power but needs Quadpacer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:1. Travel case2. Improved brush head design that makes it easier to keep clean.3. Excellent cleaning power so reduces plaque buildup.4. Reduces need for flossing because it can clean between the teeth (although you should still floss periodically).5. 2 year warranty. The Advance series only had a 1 year warranty.Cons:1. No quadpacer. (has a 2 minute timer, but you have to keep track of how much you brush each section.)2. Handle doesn&rsquo;t have the rubber strip to reduce slippage like the Advance series did.3. Brush bristles seem more brittle and poke your gums.4. Angled brush head is not as comfortable as the straight brush head design, but that might be a personal preference.5. Low battery warning is too early. You still have plenty of brushings left before the battery actually runs out. (I prefer to charge the battery when it is very depleted, as rechargeable batteries have a limited number of charges. So if you charge the battery when the power has only been partially depleted, you will shorten the useful life of the battery.)</p>

<h5 id="swear-buy-sonicare-this-is-my-2nd">Swear buy Sonicare, this is my 2nd!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to buy this toothbrush due to my original Sonicare finally biting the dust. I had it for many years and was well worth it&rsquo;s hefty price I paid for it. Since my original, there have been many new models out and I opted for this one b/c of the better price than a few others.Pros: More universal head that is more flexible than the originals. Easier to purchase new heads. Now the heads come with the indicator in the bristles to let you know when to replace compared to the old ones that you used to replace every 6mths. My dentist is always very impressed with the condition of my teeth :).Cons: On this model only, for some reason it doesn&rsquo;t have the beep at every 30sec interval during your 2 minute brushing time.If you are thinking of buying a Sonicare for the 1st time, BUY IT! They are great at cleaning areas that a normal toothbrush can&rsquo;t. I could not see myself going back to manual.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="superb-and-from-philips-no-less">Superb - and from Philips, no less.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As with the other reviewers I had reservations about spending this much on a toothbrush, especially from Philips. (For those who don&rsquo;t know, at one time Philips quality was second to none but these days Philips is more like Harman Kardon; their stuff looks better than it is. Philips TVs would be a good example).After reading all the rave reviews and discovering the technology was developed by Sonicare prior to being acquired by Philips I figured I&rsquo;d take a chance. And I have to say, this toothbrush is amazing. Once you get used to the vibrating, you will look forward to brushing your teeth. The box says your teeth will look whiter in 28 days but I could see difference after 5 days.My only reservations are that the Ni-Cad battery technology is pretty ancient and it makes the toothbrush rather heavy for travel but these are minor details. Worth every penny!</p>

<p>One of the best tooth brushes around. I have been very pleased and my better check ups are a reflection of using this twice a day. Highly recommend this product.</p>
