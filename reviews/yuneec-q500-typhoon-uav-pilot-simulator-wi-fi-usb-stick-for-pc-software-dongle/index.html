<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="must-have">Must have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have the Yuneec Typhoon this is a cheep must have.many You Tube vids on how to bind it to the Yuneec transmitter.Great for practice and to let someone else fly without the danger a crash.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-in-box-hover-exercises-included-in-the-uav-pilot-software-are-a-great-way-to-sharpen-your-skills-without-breaking-the-aircra">The in-box hover exercises included in the UAV Pilot software are a great way to sharpen your skills without breaking the aircra</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the dongle, downloaded the software, I bound it to my ST10+ transmitter, and followed the on screen instructions. Since I have watched several videos about the Q500+ I felt confident right out of the gate. It has very realistic scenery, I wish there had been other scenes to fly in, but maybe it will be added in the future. The in-box hover exercises included in the UAV Pilot software are a great way to sharpen your skills without breaking the aircraft. Wind speeds can be adjusted and do affect the flying of the simulator. The non-GPS mode is really fast! A great investment for any Q500 owner!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-others-your-anti-virus-will-detect-a-trojan2">Like others, your anti virus will detect a Trojan2 &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like others, your anti virus will detect a Trojan2 virus during install. I called Yuncee and they insure it&rsquo;s a bug and not a virus. The software loaded after I allowed, no issues since. The stick arrived earlier than expected. Flight simulation is very realistic and just like flying the aircraft for real. The program sometimes intermittently shuts down. After initial binding to the dongle, I found that turning the transmitter on before staring the software binds to my tramsmitter every time, as long as you select the dongle as the model first. Getting into manual mode (no GPS) is a bit intermittent, but once established, shows you exactly what flying very fast is all about!This product has a lot of promise if they could add more scenery choices and simulate wind conditions. Overall I like the product, very realistic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-yuneec-owners">A Must Have For Yuneec Owners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very realistic flight simulator. Great for practicing maneuvers without risking a crash. If you have never flown a quad before, this will greatly help. I wish they included this with the quads as I think it is very beneficial. Well worth the $29 price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-for-typhoon-h-owners">MUST HAVE FOR TYPHOON H OWNERS!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to be used with my Typhoon H as I was informed that it was now compatible with the remote that comes with the Typhoon H. Yuneec has also updated the software so that you can fly a simulated Typhoon H with this simulator. I have to say, I was VERY impressed with how realistic and accurate the simulator was! With the Typhoon H remote you can control all of the basic flight functions of the H, including the landing gear. You can even rotate and pan the camera that is on the simulator. And just like the real thing, you can adjust the speed of the H by the joystick as well as the speed dial.TAKING OFF NOTE!One thing that I did have to learn is, in order to take flight, you have to make sure the speed dial is NOT at the slowest setting. This means you will need to push the lever that is on the right side in the front up slightly. You will hear a &ldquo;beep&rdquo; when you did this that indicates you are able to take off.Please note that the simulated camera does NOT broadcast any images! The simulator is not designed for that. It&rsquo;s purpose is to provide flight experience and training.There are also 3 Challenges in the simulator that grade your performance and allow you to keep track of your progress. My first attempt at Challenge #1 yielded me a 19%, however, after several tries I reached a high of 89%. Because I am an over achiever, I&rsquo;m pushing for an A!With this simulator you will DEFINITELY improve your control of your drone. I HIGHLY recommend that anyone who owns a Yuneec drone purchase this!</p>

<h5 id="great-way-for-a-beginner-to-learn-to-fly-his-her-new-drone-a-must-have-in-my-opinion">Great way for a beginner to learn to fly his/her new drone. A must have in my opinion.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This really should come with the Q500 drone but glad it&rsquo;s available. I am a newbie flying drones. I had a cheapie that got away from me so wanted to get one that had a bit of more control so bought the Yuneec Q500+. Flew it twice but felt a bit clumsy with it so put it back in the box and ordered this. I didn&rsquo;t find it hard at all to get connected to my controller. The software was a bit touchy on the computer, but my computer isn&rsquo;t exactly fast or new. Once I got it working, I found it really did feel like flying the drone. I have always defaulted to the &ldquo;headless&rdquo; mode or what ever they call it so never really had any experience flying normally. This gave me the opportunity to practice that and I found it flies better that way. The software also has some activities to help you learn control, one is a flying box that you are supposed to keep the drone inside the box. It&rsquo;s harder than it looks. Once I took the real drone out for a real flight, I felt a lot more confident and in control. I highly recommend you buy this along with your drone and use this first if you have not had much flying experience.</p>

<h5 id="cheapest-way-to-learn-to-fly-your-yuneec-q500-drone">Cheapest way to learn to fly your Yuneec Q500 drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I learned to fly my Q500 before it ever lifted off the ground.You can use your ST10+ controller with your PC and fly a virtual drone through a field.You have to download the software for free from Yuneec&rsquo;s website.Con: There is only one background to fly in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-yuneec-uav-pilit-software">Happy with yuneec UAV Pilit software.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Gave this a try even though many reviewers said they had problems installing software. I followed instructions and software worked after installing it. What I like is how when drone is sitting on screen, you can see the blinking led lights, then refer to Yuneec reference material to see what they mean, so when I&rsquo;m actually flying I do not need to refer to reference and cheat sheets. Flying is a lot easier with the simulation software, I use some wind when using simulation to make flying drone a little harder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can fly a drone with my controller right on my pc, really cool</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to bad for a first time simulator, but lacking for the experienced user.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have">A MUST HAVE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an extremely useful tool to Yuneec product owners. Yuneec has always made exceptional products and this exceeded my expectations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-ve-never-flown-a-quad">If You&rsquo;ve Never Flown a Quad&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you get the hang of your quad&hellip;you&rsquo;ll probably never use it again. But - if it&rsquo;s a long time between flights, it can help you stay in touch with your controls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not worth the money. Not recommened!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No Problem</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yuneec-flight-simulator">Yuneec Flight Simulator</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, just make sure you have a pretty fast computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as expected</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommend-if-you-have-no-eperience">Recommend If You Have No Eperience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good for anyone who has never flown a drone before. Drone in simulation performs exactly the way it does in real life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars-1">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had to return, work OK but nut for me.</p>
