<blockquote>
<p>This was my hubbys 2nd drone. Right when he took it out of the box he was happy. This one he did not have to assemble. The other one he had he had to and ran into a few issues. SO fir this one to be fully assembled was a plus. This is a smaller size but decent sized drone. It is black and very lightweight. It has two white blades and two black blades. Once you follow the directions to calibrate the control its ready to fly. It comes with the control that you can put your smartphone in. The app was easy to install. The camera on it takes very good quality pictures. I was quite surprised at how good actually. There is several modes to choose from when flying this drone. You can use the control or you can use your phone to control. You can just tilt your phone to make it go that way. This drone is durable. I say that with a huge amount of seriousness. I cannot tell you the things it has hit and fell into and still works like the day we got it. We have a big fish pond in our front yard and unfortunately it went for a swim. We thought it was a gonner but nope. We got it out and it flew like it didnt even go in the water. This is a good starter drone for those who want to try it out or get it for their kids. My daughter flew it easily. Do not try to fly it in the wind. It WILL hit something. The other plus on this drone is that it come with 2 batteries. The batteries take about an hour or so to fully charge. Flight time is only around 10minutes. But sometimes Im glad they only last that long. Otherwise I may not have a house or windows in my car. LOL..WHen it is in flight it is very quiet unlike our other one. It has 2 red lights and 2 blue lights on the bottom. It looks really cool in the dark. My hubby is pretty satisfied with this drone. Luckily, he is getting better at flying it!</p>

<h5 id="awesome-quadcopter-drone-for-anyone">Awesome Quadcopter drone for anyone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were very excited when the quadcopter drone arrived in the package and we were not disappointed when we started flying it! This drone does come with a remote which is how we expected to fly it. We actually use our phone to control it as well, which is incredible technology that allows you to steer it seamlessly.The first week outside had pretty windy conditions, but the drone actually did very well and was very stable in the air as we controlled it&rsquo;s maneuverability. The camera takes fantastic videos and pictures, and we took some great family pictures when our entire extended family was at a park cookout. The quadcopter lasts for over ten solid minutes in the air which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. I highly recommend this to anyone as you don&rsquo;t have to be a skilled aviator to fly this!</p>

<p>WIFI FPV Version U818A Drone with 720P HD Camera DBPOWER Headless Mode Quadcopter with 2 Batteries Long Flying Time Drone for BeginnersThis is the second drone I owned. My first drone was genetic one. This drone is much better than my first drone. It is easy to control and yet pretty fast as I think its motor is much better than my first one. It&rsquo;s pretty light weight but pretty sturdy as well. I had it bumped into several obstacles during my first few tries it definitely is able to stand the impact. It also has an anti-crash safeguard feature to keep it from having massive crash landings. It&rsquo;s got two separate modes: one for beginner and the other for more advanced so it seems to allow for more advanced drone control as you get better at it. The battery seems to last for about 8 minutes or so but it comes with extra battery so good enough to play with single charge on both batteries. App was very easy to install and you can control the drone either using the controller or your mobile device (I have iphone). The quality of the HD transmission is good and better than I expected at this price. This drone has lights (blue and red) and looks pretty cool especially flying at night. Great drone for beginners at this price tag.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-drone">Awesome Drone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an Awesome Drone It&rsquo;s also great for beginner training. Very light weight so any wind at all will make controlling it a little harder. Although, it is lightweight it&rsquo;s tough and so far has survived two teenage boys with beginner skills beautifully. The remote is very easy to use and all the buttons are clearly labeled as long as you read the instructions you will know what they are for. Calibration is very easy to understand and learn, the app is simple to download and use, all you have to do is connect to its specified wifi. The battery life is short, but enough that you have a fantastic time, plus you have the back up battery. They charge back up pretty fast. It beeped to give us enough warning to bring it back before it died, speaking of that the return to home button is quite awesome, hold it down and the drone comes flying back to you. The picture and video quality is great, the phone fits right onto the remote no problem, It also comes with a SD card and four extra propellers. I found it pretty easy to control and so did my sons, they picked up on it way before I did, and the flips it does are so fun. It has lights for night flying. This drone is definitely great quality and so much fun for yourself or the whole family to fly or watch.</p>
