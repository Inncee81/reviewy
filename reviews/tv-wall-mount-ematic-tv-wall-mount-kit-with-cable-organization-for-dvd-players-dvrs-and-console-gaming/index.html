<p>Shelves are over 1&rdquo; smaller in both directions.</p>

<h5 id="looks-like-the-design-has-been-revamped">Looks like the design has been revamped&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not a bad shelf, but the unit that was shipped to me is different from what is pictured (here on Amazon and on the Ematic website). I have a few of these already and bought 2 more to match the look of the existing units. The new EMD211 is a little bit different, for instance, instead of a screw that goes through the glass from the top of the metal shelf bracket underneath, the new design is 3 screws over the top onto a plastic plate to hold the shelf there by pressure. The old style design is definately easier to work with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install">Easy to install!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was very easy to install and looks great!In the photo, it&rsquo;s off center due to there being an air duct in the wall. :(Also it&rsquo;s too small for a PS4. But that&rsquo;s ok, the Blu-Ray player I want will fit just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-serious-design-flaw-could-be-dangerous-around-a-toddler">Decent, Serious Design Flaw ( Could be dangerous around a toddler)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this when I revamped my sons room for his sony blueray player and his playstation. The install was pretty easy after finding a stud in the wall to mount it on. The shelves went together with ease as well. Lets talk about the shelves though. They tend to loosen over time for no apparent reason. I am always checking it and tightening the adjuster screws. I do believe it&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s made. Having a shelf that is completely supported by a central locking mechanism only and is this wide is just simple physics&hellip; A push down on the left or right of the glass shelf will, over time, start to loosen the screw. That in itself is a safety issue for me. He is only 10 so if the shelf starts to dump and I am not around , its going to be bad. It may hurt my son and /or even damage the expensive electronics that sit on it. He has learned to be very gentle with it when changing out Blue rays or Game discs but Imagine a toddler doing the same&hellip;Not good, folks. I have had no other issues than that. It has been in his room for almost a year now and its fine. Just DO NOT throw away the allen wrench because you will need it again. If I had to pick another shelf for his room I honestly would shop around some more. Basically, it does its job but I wouldn&rsquo;t buy another one.Thank you for reading and I do hope this review will help someone. Be Safe &amp; Happy Shopping!!</p>

<h5 id="dangerous">Dangerous!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is dangerous! As my husband was installing it, one of the glass shelves shattered and glass went everywhere and cut him on his arms. We bought this for my children&rsquo;s playroom, so it is scary to think what could have happened if they had been near when it broke. I would NOT recommend this product. Amazon did give me a full refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="many-issues">Many issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, the most helpful review is totally accurate, these shelves are about an inch smaller than advertised in each direction, which cuts about 25 square inches off each shelf total. Additionally, the concept of &ldquo;cord management&rdquo; is a joke here. There are two plates along each side of the mounting bar that would allow cords to go in and out, but&hellip; why? The holes aren&rsquo;t big enough to fit all the cords we have, and you would just need to pop them back out on the bottom through the side anyway, so they bulge out because they want to go horizontal at that point. If the &ldquo;decorative&rdquo; cap (it actually is the only reason the side plates stay on) on the bottom had holes in it so cords could go through there, that would be real cord management.As far as hardware is concerned&hellip; The mounting bolts themselves are big and tough, but so cheap they strip at the slightest provocation. We have two sets of these shelves we&rsquo;re forced to use because they&rsquo;re literally stuck to our walls. The way the shelf brackets screw onto the mounting bar seems very flimsy. No matter how hard you tighten those screws, you can still fairly easily tip the shelf one way or another; it&rsquo;s just never tight enough. And of course, again you run into the problem of stripping THOSE screws, just trying to get the shelf stable. Third hardware problem is the small (SMALL) screw right in the center back of each shelf, used to hold the shelf onto the bracket. Once you have the pads on to protect the shelves from slipping around on the brackets, they sit too high up, so if you put that little connecting screw in and turn it once so it&rsquo;s actually serving a purpose, the front of the shelf raises up and is no longer sitting on anything.Even putting aside all the problems I&rsquo;ve listed, the size itself is just totally inadequate for consoles. We have a PS3 (the slim version, not the giant first gen one) on the bottom shelf of one of these units, and it doesn&rsquo;t even fully fit. The PS4 is on another set and that&rsquo; just a joke, if I wasn&rsquo;t MORE worried about my children than I am about the shelf, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d keep it up there.My 3 pictures show: PS3 shelf from the bottom, PS4 shelf from the bottom, and the &ldquo;cord management.&rdquo;(edited to correct the order of images)</p>
