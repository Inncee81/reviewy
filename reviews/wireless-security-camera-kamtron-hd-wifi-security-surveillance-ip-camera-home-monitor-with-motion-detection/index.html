<h5 id="have-these-all-around-the-house-love-them">Have these all around the house, love them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a couple of these cameras and they are great. Easy to setup, work great and are relatively inexpensive. The app needed to view them from your phone (MIPC - see attached image) is easy to install and easy to pair with the cameras. I love being able to look at my phone and jump from camera to camera to see what is going on. The motion detection is not the best, as I can never get the sensitivity just right but it is as cool feature (if you can get it configured adequately). Also you need to have the MIPC app running in the background on your phone for the motion alert to go off. So if you are expecting this camera to be a <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> security monitor, I don&rsquo;t think it will meet your expectations. For me however I don&rsquo;t use the motion or alerts. For the most part I use these cameras to check on my kids (when in their room), my dog and to see if any packages have been delivered to my front door. Your only limitations are that you need to be close to a power outlet, and they are not designed for outdoor use. I was in Mexico last week and loved being able to see my house and make sure everything was okay. Love the camera, I highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this camera out of curiosity as such product is very popular among people. It did give us surprise! First the quality and delicate design really meet our expectations. It is very easy and convenient to install by following the instructions. To use an App in cellphone to monitor also facilitates its flexibility and high-tech feature.We like such features. It output the 720P HD images which is really crispy, with a wide-angle camera. It could rotate 350 degree horizontally, and up to 70 degree vertically. It moves quietly without much noise.We use it with a crib to monitor the baby, which liberates us from walking back and forth. Of course, you can put it as an safeguard anywhere of your house.It is a good buy overall.</p>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so glad that I purchased this camera. I bought two cameras to replace two Arlos that were constantly eating up batteries and going offline. I have been using the Kamtrons for two weeks now, and can honestly say that they are a huge improvement. The WiFi connection has been stable, and obviously no batteries. Even though both are 720p, the picture on the Kamtron is noticeably clearer. Having a microphone is also a big plus, as is the ability to adjust the view with pan and tilt.While researching cameras, I sent an e-mail to the seller to ask some questions, and was pleasantly surprised by his prompt and helpful responses. One of the reasons that I ultimately decided to buy the Kamtron was due to the responsiveness of the seller. After purchase, I needed a fair amount of hand holding, and the seller promptly (keeping in mind that he is in a very different time zone), courteously, and patiently answered all of my questions.I have found that the phone app is the best way to view the cameras. I initially had some trouble viewing video on my laptop, particularly watching recorded video. If viewing on a computer, I discovered that you need to download the PC Client, AND then access the camera by clicking on the shortcut on the screen to launch the computer app. If I tried to access the camera though my internet browser, I was able to see live video but wasn&rsquo;t able to play recorded video. Once I realized that you need to launch the app by clicking on the icon shortcut instead of going to the mipcm.com website through the browser, it worked much better. However, the phone app works better than the computer app. I actually bought myself an Android phone in order to be able to use the phone app.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-s-very-easy-to-set-up-this-camera">it&rsquo;s very easy to set up this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s very easy to set up this camera. The instruction has the barcode for the app. Just scan the barcode to download the up and sign up for an account. There is an unique barcode on the bottom for each device, scan that to register and connect to wifi. Ready to go. I&rsquo;m surprised how vivid the image is. Very clear and high-resolution. Touch the screen to rotate the camera direction. Two way talking. Amazing camera in an affordable price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-and-capabilities-at-an-affordable-price">Excellent quality and capabilities at an affordable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality video in both natural light and IR. Pan, tilt and zoom works fine as does the mic. I set this up in under five minutes using the instructions and it is working fine. The power cable is about 5 feet long giving plenty of cable. Camera uses audio to link / sync to set it up to your wifi which was a surprise but it worked fine, took about 20 to 30 seconds. The camera is about the size of a 12 ounce soda can, slightly shorter, and at the base slightly wider. App works good to. Wish these came in a package deal or 3 or 4.</p>

<h5 id="the-camera-is-especially-great-material-is-very-strong">The camera is especially great. Material is very strong</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera is especially great. Material is very strong, you can press the wall can also be directly by the baby bedside. I bought the baby is used to monitor. The display is very praise, even in the light when the baby can sleep very clearly photographed the baby&rsquo;s situation. And the camera can use the phone to control the direction of rotation, do not worry about the baby when the cry did not notice.</p>

<h5 id="nanny-security-cam">Nanny/ Security Cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using 6 ft computer desk why not add a security camera to it so I can see who&rsquo;s is using my computer at home if they move the camera than I know someone move it LOL. The video quality is decent night mode pretty awesome mainly I like the Wi-Fi feature got a spare phone install the app so I can see it anytime anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-camera">Nice camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received the camera yesterday. Nicely packaged. User Manual instructions to setup APP were good. Wi-Fi setup instructions not so clear, couldnâ€™t get camera to connect to Wi-Fi. Camera would only blink red leds in the front and not the green led . ( the led location is not shown on the Method 2 Wi-Fi connection page in the manual, shown on introduction page) . Tried several times unplugging power, making sure connections were right, phone WiFi connected etc. Went on-line where they showed the reset button needed to be pressed,didn&rsquo;t find anything about this in the manual. Once I did that the camera connected to the Wi-Fi. Works well, clear images, camera rotates, moves up and down. Need to play with it more to better understand all it can do.TS</p>

<h5 id="seems-great-after-a-little-trouble-getting-connected">Seems great (after a little trouble getting connected)</h5>

<p>Device seems to work well. It was easy to set up and get motion detection alerts. Downloading the app was easy too.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-good-hardware-poor-camera-software">Pretty good hardware, poor camera software</h5>

<p>The Kamtron HD WiFi Security Camera, in my opinion, is a pretty good camera, but the camera software mipcm.com / mipcm app has problems.</p>
