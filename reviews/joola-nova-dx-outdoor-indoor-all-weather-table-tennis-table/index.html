<h5 id="setup-was-super-easy-just-had-to-attach-legs">Setup was super easy, just had to attach legs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was definitely everything I expected and more. Setup was super easy, just had to attach legs, all hinges were pre-assembled, The table top was flawless. I&rsquo;ve played on this for about 3 weeks now and I have to say it&rsquo;s the best outdoor table I&rsquo;ve played on. Certainly better than a comparable Kettler Outdoor, for the price. I love the low profile storage, and the 2 separate pieces allow for a configurable playback mode, which is awesome. I highly recommend this table to anyone looking for an outdoor table, with the best value for money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-price">Worth the &ldquo;price&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Surface gets scratched very easily even with the wood paddles, the paint comes off just by wiping it down with cloth. Very frustrating.Construction is stable, easy to assemble, cuts are even and good.Net mount is really cheap plastic but holds &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; straight, the net itself is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-table">Very nice table</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this table for about a month. It seems to be very sturdy and well made. The surface is quite interesting&hellip;its like a solid piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; resin. It seems like it will be very long lasting and has a nice look to it. The net is of quality design and keeps its tension. It is a 2 piece table, so it can be a bit difficult to get perfectly level if playing on an uneven surface. It folds up and down seemlessly, but is not like a normal recreational table that stays in one piece. When the tables are folded up the net generally needs to be taken down as well because it attaches to both sides of the table. The two table pieces lock when folded up and roll nicely. All of this won&rsquo;t matter if you plan to leave it in one place, but if planning to move it a lot it could be more work than you want.Assembly was a breeze, but the table pieces were quite heavy so you will need at least one other person to help, my wife was able to be my helper, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a &ldquo;muscle man&rdquo;&hellip;although my wife is pretty ripped ;).I&rsquo;m not too particular about my surfaces, but like I said the surface seems even in terms of bounce and the net is very nice&hellip;not sure what else you would want in a table!Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="great-table-at-a-great-price">Great table at a great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this for our vacation home. It arrived a few days before we got there and even though we left a note to leave it on the porch when the delivery guys came the note had blown off. They called and I was able to speak with the delivery company and they allowed me to send an email confirming that I gave permission for them to leave the package. I thought this was great service! Once we arrived and unpacked the table we were impressed with how sturdy and nice the table was / is. It took my husband and his brother 20 minutes to set up and we have been playing on it every since. The table is sturdy, well designed, and easy to level (we have it outside in the yard). Overall this is a well made table. We purchased a cover for it but cannot comment yet on how well it will stand up to the elements (rain and sun in Florida).</p>

<h5 id="great-table-for-the-price-very-easy-setup">Great table for the price! Very easy setup.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The JOOLA Nova Outdoor Table Tennis Table is a great value (mind you I purchased it from Amazon at 40% off MSRP). I was looking at purchasing an outdoor table for my family to play in our carport during the warmer/nicer months with the option to move it into our basement when it got too cold. Looking over the reviews of other tables (Stiga Coronado for one) I decided to go with the Nova due to the ease of assembly and storage. The shipping was fast and the delivery company worked well with us to make sure we were home for delivery. Assembling the table was a piece of cake. All you have to do is attach the &ldquo;T&rdquo; sections of the legs that have the casters and all that consisted of was using the included plates and two bolts per &ldquo;foot&rdquo; to bolt them together. Everything else was assembled. This is my first high quality table tennis table purchase so I don&rsquo;t have experience with other&rsquo;s build quality, but the Nova is very solid. The table top is solid and flat even though it&rsquo;s only 6mm surface. The casters are high quality, sturdy, all metal (exept for the rubber wheel surface), and all four will independently lock. I don&rsquo;t feel that I have to be gentle when moving the table. The other legs are solid and have adjustable feet. The only issue that I saw were that the two different sections stood at different heights in the middle so I had to use the net bracket to even them out to play. Speaking of the net, I read quite a few people complain about the quality of the net, but I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of issues with it and it works just fine. If the net is a HUGE deal to you, you&rsquo;ll probably want to invest in a higher quality one though.Overall, I have been very happy with this purchase. I have 5 children under the age of 12 and we play on the table AT LEAST 2 hours a day between everyone and it has held up VERY well. (I was even inspired to get a JOOLA catch-net/Ipong combo to use for working out). NOTE: Due to getting this table at the start of winter I have yet to use it outside. BUT looking at the build quality (table surface, powder coating, quality of welds, etc.) I have little doubt that it would work extremely well.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-table">Love this table!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this table as a Christmas present for our family and we just love it! I know that sometimes ping pong tables just sit around and become storage for mail or other items, but so far, our family is playing a lot! It&rsquo;s a great way to offer something else to the kids besides video games and TV. The assembly of the main table was really easy - the only somewhat confusing part was putting the net onto the posts - we could have used a little more direction on that part. but did figure it out We decided to get an outdoor table because we&rsquo;re going to keep it in the garage when the weather gets a little better and we didn&rsquo;t want a wood table to warp with humidity (or the horrible eventuality of leaving it out in the rain!) We keep the table folded up and it takes about 20 seconds to roll it out and be ready to play.</p>
