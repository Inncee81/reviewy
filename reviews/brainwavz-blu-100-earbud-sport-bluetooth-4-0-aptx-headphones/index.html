<h5 id="the-blu-100-sound-the-most-like-grados">The BLU-100 sound the most like Grados.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound equipment on hand:Etymotics er4pGrado Sr60Jaybird Bluebuds XMy sound preference includes neutral mids and bass, with a slight emphasis on the highs. Usually anything from Grado fits the bill for me, sonically. I regard anything that&rsquo;s bass heavy (a la any Beats headphones), or mid-heavy/muddy (skullcandy/apple headphones) as crap. So please consider my preferences, as your expectations may differ from mine.The BLU-100 sound the most like Grados. The highs are bright, but the bass has more of a presence without being boomy or muddy. I was actually very impressed with them the first time I fired them up. For $40, I was expecting the sound of $20 headphones, but with the addition of BT. Pleasant surprise.The Bluebuds X have more subdued highs, with slightly more exaggerated bass. To me, a bit less clarity, which is unfortunate because it&rsquo;s nearly 3-4X the cost of the BLU-100.Where the BLU-100s fail is reception. If you keep the full length of the cord draped across your back, most likely your reception will be fine. I attempted to shorten the cord by folding it over itself, a la the Bluebuds X, but once you do, you lose MASSIVE range on the headphones.My original intent was to use the BLU-100 (with its long cord folded on itself and tied behind my head) paired with my android wear Moto 360 smartwatch. But, when the cord is folded, you BT signal becomes weak and the audio becomes choppy. But, if you allow the BLU-100 to drape without any folding of the cord, reception works fine on the android wear device. For me this wasn&rsquo;t an option so I had to return it.Otherwise, the fitment is fine with the comply tips, and I had no issues with these staying in while sprinting.</p>

<h5 id="is-that-bass-that-i-feel-updated">Is that BASS that I feel??? UPDATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start off by saying i buy a lot of inexpensive headphones. I guess i should just pony up and buy a great pair, but there is something that just won&rsquo;t allow to spend some serious coin on headphones. That being said, i have owned a number of bluetooth stereo headphones and none of them come close to the sound that comes from these headphones. I mean i could actually FEEL the bass in my ear, which is not something i am accustomed to with bluetooth headphones. I love everything about these little guys. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for low profile bluetooth earbuds&hellip;UPDATE 10/4/15Battery life has been disappointing. Not that i was expecting them to last weeks with the small form factor, but i think i maybe get 2 hours out of them before they die, but that&rsquo;s not constant listening. I basically can use them twice and hope they make it through the second use. There seems to be a small light that is ALWAYS ON inside the control module and i think that is killing the battery (see picture i posted). Not sure if that is the problem, but battery life has not been very good. Minus 2 stars for having less than advertised battery life.I have also taken them running a few times, and love them for that. Don&rsquo;t even notice they are there. I have some jaybird freedoms that i also run with and there as much better. No cord noise to speak of. Sound is still excellent. Only annoyance is that with the placing of the control module, the cord tends to gather to the right of my neck rather than rest uniformly behind my neck, but that is to be expected with this design regardless of the manufacturer.UPDATE &ndash; was contacted by customer service and they sent me replacement earbuds, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! The new ones have great battery life, so the first ones were defective for sure. They are still very comfortable and my go to for headphones currently (they fit nicely in a small altoids mint can, the long skinny kind). The only drawback i have seen, and the reason i take off one star here, is because their range leaves much to be desired. I have gone running with them and with my phone in a running belt around my waste, they regularly loose their connection. Had to go back to running with my jaybirds, which is a bummer because i like the fit and feel of these much better.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-set-of-buds-at-an-even-better-price">A great set of buds, at an even better price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall Rating: 9/10Would I recommend these buds?Yes. For $39.50 They&rsquo;re a great set of buds.Pros:Great sound quality for the priceRelatively small footprintComfortable seal with the Comply Foam TipsBattery life is as advertisedThe LED indicator is very small, and almost unnoticeable unless you know where to look. On the bad side, it&rsquo;s hard to see.Cons:Can be uncomfortable for smaller ears, as the earbuds are on the larger sideCouldn&rsquo;t maintain a proper seal with the silicon buds, but once the Comply tips were on, my goodness is the sound nice on theseI don&rsquo;t like the weight imbalance due to the mic, it&rsquo;s not a deal breaker, but something that I definitely noticeThe LED indicator is very small, and almost unnoticeable unless you know where to look. On the plus side, its very discreet.I purchased the BLU-100&rsquo;s mainly for gym and running use, as I have other earbuds and headphones for home listening.I needed a pair of phones that wouldn&rsquo;t break my wallet or my ears, and wouldn&rsquo;t get in my way at the gym or while I was out for a run.These phones do exactly that.They fit snugly and produce a great sound, with enough isolation that you can drown out outside noise with your music, but not so isolating that you&rsquo;re completely blocked out from the outside world. This is very important to me at the gym and while running. At the gym, I prefer my music to be loud, and to block out everything around me so I can focus on my set. While out for a run, I like having some background music, but I do need to be aware of my surroundings, for safety&rsquo;s sake.I&rsquo;ve never had an issue with these slipping out or cutting out, since I do keep my phone on me at all times at the gym or when running.The only issues I&rsquo;ve had with these are with comfort.For the most part, once I have them in my ears, I don&rsquo;t even realize that they&rsquo;re there.However, the mic being on one side does cause the cable to favor that side, and it does make it feel unbalanced. It&rsquo;s a minor qualm, and you may not even notice it.Secondly, these are fairly large buds. I personally don&rsquo;t have issues with them, but I can see them causing some discomfort for those with smaller ears. I&rsquo;ve had a bit of discomfort after longer sessions if I hadn&rsquo;t placed them in properly, but usually they&rsquo;re fine.</p>

<h5 id="decent-sound-atrocious-calls-mediocre-fit">Decent sound, atrocious calls, mediocre fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These sound pretty decent for being bluetooth and only $40, but in calls, they were so difficult to hear what was being said to me that it makes them almost unusable for calls.</p>

<h5 id="they-worked-great-until-now">They worked great until now</h5>

<p>I bought these in September 2016. Almost one year ago. They worked great until now, August 2017. They just stopped turning on.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pleased with these. Excellent sound and bluetooth range and great quality, particularly for such a low price.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good sound. Fit in the ear is average. The reason for 4 rating is that the battery life is only about 4 hours. I am satisfied with his product.</p>

<h5 id="so-the-battery-life-in-the-one-s-i-purchased-is-not-good-at-all">So the battery life in the one&rsquo;s I purchased is not good at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It you&rsquo;re looking for inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds, these will work. I use these basically as hands free when talking on my iPhone 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-great">Work great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ear buds work well. Last for about 4 hours. Only complaint is that the back of the ear buds have a tendency to get caught in my hair because of the rubber material.</p>

<h5 id="10-out-of-10">10 out of 10</h5>

<p>Good sound, great quality. Really love these ear buds, and the price was well worth it.</p>

<p>My husband bought these headphones for me to work out with, and they work great. They are comfortable and have good sound, especially for the price.</p>
