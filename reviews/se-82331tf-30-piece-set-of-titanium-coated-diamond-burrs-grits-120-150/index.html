<blockquote>
<p>Arrived on time, as described.The packaging opened up during shipment, allowing each individual piece in the set to fly all over the inside of the box. Fortunately, none of the 30 pieces were lost, and no damage was done to them, either. The pieces themselves are well made and virtually flawless. Though I have only used a few of the burrs, the ones I have used work well, and seem durable.Other than the cheap packaging, this set is really good for the price and I recommend it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found using these with my Dremel was terrific. I use a CNC router to make fancy cribbage boards and there are a lot of nooks and crannies to be cleaned out. These little bits really work well for me. I also tried 3M Radial Bristle Disc Kit at a lot more money and it was a disappointment. These work much better for me.

<p>Okay so I fully expected these things to shatter on contact with any given surface, but instead?I&rsquo;m new to the gig, so of course I do things my own way. This is what people who are professionals like to call &ldquo;the wrong way&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m hardheaded. To my surprise so are these! Without using water, without keeping an eye on temperature, without even putting them in right these things have lasted and lasted. I carve rocks for my Etsy, so I put the machine on full speed, ignore all manuals, and becomes extremely stupid for short periods in which I slowly remove my safety gear in order to see better.I snapped two, under pressure, not properly tightened, without water or any lubrication, at top speed. Two.The other 28 pieces are still going strong after oh, what, drilling through about 20 stones from my backyard on top of carving the face of like 10 others and more objects than that in general? And I haven&rsquo;t even used all of them since I tend to just need direct drilling or etching but heck, they work on stone considering I tested them all the first time I touched them to see what worked doing what. It&rsquo;s handled some stones with mica chips, some gabbro (granite), one piece of fool&rsquo;s gold, other unidentified hard stuff, sandstone (by far the easiest), and even quartz (which explodes with lightning internally, it&rsquo;s so cool, but it eats blades like crazy not these though!). They stand up to being tilted in directions they really should not be bent (You know better self!) and even wriggling them in the hole I&rsquo;ve created. They still carve perfect little details, although I have to admit they are wider than I&rsquo;d like. But that&rsquo;s by design so what, am I going to blame people for making what they say they will? How about no.The container is the crappiest thing you&rsquo;ll ever see by far, but you&rsquo;re likely buying these for the bits. This is extremely cheap, but wow. Wood, Bone, Stone, anything I get a hold on seems to be no problem. I&rsquo;ve even done soft leather with fur on, and glow in the dark plastic. I&rsquo;ve carved my name into everything I can get my hands on, used them to clean off soda cans, and engrave them. I&rsquo;ve used them to cut composition books, admittedly real drill tips do better but I like to rebind mine for long life and I try them on anything out of a sick sense of curiosity. I&rsquo;ve used them on everything and they just cheerfully keep cutting even though it&rsquo;s clear I should have broken or dulled them with my outright mistreatment.Good bits. Best bits.</p>

<p>Ok the sole reason for this purchase was to drill glass, when I received my set hubby made this comment &ldquo;was you didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of money for those did you with a little grin&rdquo;? I answered no &ldquo; I paid something like 7 dollars for the set why?&ldquo;He laughed the proceeded to tell me that it&rsquo;s a good thing because they were not going to hold up and I wasted my money and from this set maybe I could find one bur that I liked the best and we could go buy an expensive on that size.I was kind of bummed but I had them and wanted to try drilling glass for my first time.I did a lot of research about drilling glass but never tried it so I used a bit from the set that I didn&rsquo;t care if it broke and drilled through a piece of crappy beach glass. Oh yea it worked like a charm.So I took one of the bits that would make a tiny hole that I needed, note (I am drilling in water with a Drexel 4000 on setting between 5 and 10 and I am using a solid cut lube on the bit, but so far I have drill over 25 pieces of precious authentic beach glass that I have scoured for years and years. The tip looks like it has never been used, I have not destroyed any glass even a piece that looked to have a small fracture line in to did not split when drilled.Needless to say I&rsquo;m happy and a bit smug, hubby is still in total disbelief over the fact my &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; bits work that well.So no need to spend 12-18 dollars for a fancy name brand diamond bur, just use it correctly.No diamond bur should be used dry EVER, and the cut lube helps protect the diamonds. I have my dremel set in a work station that acts like a drill press and I start to drill and lift up periodically letting the water into the hole I&rsquo;m drilling. It goes through like butter and the bit so far show no signs of wear. I actually just purchased a few more sets just to have in my craft room because it never fails when I like something they tend to disappear when it&rsquo;s time to repurchase. Being able to drill glass has open up a whole new world in my crafting. I am beyond happy, take that Tim the tool man Taylor aka my husband!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The price is good, the quality no so much. If you need these grinding burr bits for fine work or for art/jewelry then you are taking your chances. Most bits are not straight - they don&rsquo;t turn &ldquo;true&rdquo; and wobble (not my device - I checked). Many of the fine-tipped bits are bent over at the tips - shaped more like hooks than cones. I tested those that I thought were the &ldquo;better&rdquo; ones from the batch on a few small soft stones in a water bath. They seem to have kept their grit, but again, once they began spinning I could see nearly all wobbled. This problem could end up costing quite a lot of money to a beginning gem or metal jewelry worker artist.BUT&hellip; if you just need something around the workshop to trim off a &ldquo;little extra something&rdquo; and aren&rsquo;t too very worried about the end result then these might be a good purchase for you.</p>
