<blockquote>
<p>A great purchase for the price point in my opinion. A Samsung 43&rdquo; 4K, HDR, Smart TV for around $600. Despite being a Samsung, I was cautious about what to expect. Surely something was going to bother me, but so far this TV is amazing.It goes without saying that the picture quality is excellent. This is my first experience with HDR and it&rsquo;s stunning the difference it makes with a better contrast ratio and color accuracy. Pair that with increasing the resolution to 4k (and having media that is native 4k of course) and it&rsquo;s gorgeous.Built-in speakers usually don&rsquo;t impress me at all, especially being a Sennheiser headset user. That said, the speakers with this TV are surprisingly good across the whole range without distortion or vibrating the panel.One quirk that bothers me is there isn&rsquo;t a quick way to change the source on the TV. When I pull up the menu the cursor is always on the opposite end of the menu from where the source is and it doesn&rsquo;t wrap around so you have to scroll the long way to get to it. I haven&rsquo;t read the manual completely yet so there probably is a shortcut to change the source and I just don&rsquo;t know it yet, so I&rsquo;m considering this an &ldquo;other&rdquo; and not a &ldquo;con&rdquo; or a loss of a star for now.Note:The TV does not come with an HDMI cable. So if you find yourself needing to buy one, make sure it&rsquo;s marketed as Premium. The premium certification from HDMI Licensing guarantees that the cable has the bandwidth to support features such as 4k/UHD @ 60fps, HDR, etc. Don&rsquo;t bother with expensive HDMI cables either. It&rsquo;s digital so it either works or it doesn&rsquo;t. There is no signal quality difference between a $5 HDMI cable and a $100 HDMI cable.Example:Mediabridge FLEX Series HDMI Cable (6 Feet) - High-Speed Supports 4K, Ethernet, 3D and Audio Return [Newest Standard] - (Part# MPC-HDMI34-6 )</p>

<h5 id="good-tv-but-can-t-control-audio-out-volume">Good TV but can&rsquo;t control audio out volume!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The TV is nice all around. Image quality is good, smart TV features are pretty good. There are two big problems:-There is no way to control the volume of external speakers hooked up to the optical out. This is a very frustrating problem for me. I have great speakers, and a nice TV, but no way to control the speaker volume except to get up and adjust the volume knob on the back of each speaker. This is so annoying, and I haven&rsquo;t found a workaround that won&rsquo;t cost me several hundred dollars. I need to insert come volume controller between the optical and the speakers, but the hardware offering this feature is either going to be way overkill or not have a remote or cost a ton. If I had bought a Sony, this feature would have been included. It&rsquo;s crazy to me that there&rsquo;s no option for the TV&rsquo;s remote control to control the audio output.-The Wifi hardware is weak. It gets poor connectivity compared to my other wireless devices. Now I have to either run a hardwire (no easy route) or buy a separate streaming device that has a better Wifi connection.</p>

<h5 id="the-pros-cons-and-oks-for-samsung-s-un40mu-model-hr">The Pros, Cons and Oks for Samsung&rsquo;s UN40MU Model (HR),</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:_______<strong><em>(Important at the bottom regarding this review)- What you expect in a Samsung design: slick, clean, and light.- I do like the titan sliver Y stands as they do provide a decent amount of stability if you’re not going to put it on the wall.- The color balance is extremely accurate when launching it up for the first time. I didn’t feel that I had to change the layout.- Saturated reds, blues, greens are well in their levels and no matter how high the brightness level I make it these primary color still perform beautifully.- No neutral pixels you’re going to find on this screen. By connecting my laptop to show off HD screensavers, this TV brought the incredible color detail of each one (an array of colors).- Yes, 4K is shown in all its glory when you get this.- Samsung Smarthub layout is pretty easy to master as connecting your Netflix account and even internet browsing is pretty simple to do (I still prefer google chrome since my phone will always be near me).- HDR is indeed a great experience to see when the lights are turned down. My HDR experience from Amazon as it’s currently one of the few that can give you the option to see its show under the HDR experience.- Found it really cool when I turn on my PS4 it immediately switches the display layout to its game mode without me even lifting the remote.- Playing GTA 5 I didn’t see any lag that’s enough to make a notice about (Beautiful experience when driving a car in GTA.).- All you need is to download Miracast on your computer and that’s it. I was able to connect to it right away.- Oneremote controller buttons have a nice push and they don&rsquo;t have any discomforts as you can everything you need if you don’t have your phone, laptop, or your gaming counsel around.- It&rsquo;s future proof, this is not a 4 year and be done with it. You will be good for a while.Cons and Oks:</em></strong>____<strong><em>- There are hardware glitches upon digging deeper into the system. Scrolling with the remote does have some notice lag as well as sometimes I have to press an option twice to get a layout to open. I would assume future updates will fix this issue.- A decent amount of input layouts to get where you need to go. It’s a learning curve as it’s something you’re not going to learn in a day.- Playing HDR content the brightness isn’t the best around. It’s not bright at all and it’s something to take note if you’re planning to put this in an open floor panel.- The viewing angles are not good as I notice that the picture quality depletes if you move, from the center to the left and right of the screen. I would think after 6 feet away from the center you’re going to see a loss in quality (It&rsquo;s really not the much, but something you should know.)- Pretty expensive given what the market is offering for the same in software quality.- The brightness issue throughout the television is something to note, this is not only HDR.- The black levels are good but I’m sorry, OLED TVs excel in this area.- The remote itself can’t always be reliable as I recommend you use your phone for most of the interaction.Bottom Line:</em></strong>_______Important Note: This review was for the UN40MU7000, but given the spec of two, side by side, they both seem similar. If you believe this review doesn&rsquo;t illustrate the UN43MU6300 let me know and I&rsquo;ll remove it from the review list.Samsung has provided a great design and picture quality for this and it’s indeed future proof. The color content is spot on and integrated smart TV with 4k is a bundle of joy. Put it on the wall and it’ll look like a picture while the HDR experience will prepare you for the future of viewing.There are some hiccups that need to be addressed with this design as HDR isn’t much on the market yet and shouldn’t be a must have feature right now (will be in the future). Software glitches and brightness issues are something to take note when buying this layout. You will have lag sometimes when using the remote as I try to get the most of my experience with the phone. Not only that but you will find cheaper TV’s with the same layout that this one has.Overall these cons are really not significant to change your mind as the main question you need to ask is whether you prefer OLED instead. As a Samsung user for many years, each TV made by them will hold its ground well beyond the expected breaking point. They put great care into making their TV’s and is why the brand is one reason you need to take into account before you buy. Verdict: A beautiful TV with an indecent price layout, given what the market is spitting out.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer</p>
