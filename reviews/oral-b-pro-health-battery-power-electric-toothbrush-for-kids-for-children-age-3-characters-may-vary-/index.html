<h5 id="cute-brushes-fyi-brushes-not-replacable-as-product-description-states-characters-may-vary">Cute Brushes, FYI Brushes Not Replacable, As Product Description States, Characters May Vary</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a product that initially, I bought one for our son, who has Autism among other things, because I thought this would be a good item to work on getting him used to the tooth cleaner they use at dentists visits. I know that visually there are definitely some differences, but the noise, and the circular shape of the top part of the brush I figured would give us a good starting place to work on desensitizing him to it.When it arrived, my daughter thought it was so cute, she wanted one. And she&rsquo;s been using it for a couple days now, and she says she loves it and prefers it to a traditional toothbrush. So I may get her a permanent electric toothbrush with replaceable brushes after this one dies.As other reviewers have noted, characters you get will vary. This is actually in the top line of the product description under Amazon, so I personally don&rsquo;t feel like I can find any fault with that. It was right there for me to read. We personally got 1 with the princesses, and one with Olaf. So our daughter wanted the princess one, and I let her take that one, because our son prefers Olaf anyways, but quite honestly, he&rsquo;s still in the totally hating it stage because it makes a noise he doesn&rsquo;t like. But I feel pretty confident this is going to be useful in his therapy modules, so I&rsquo;m pleased with the noise.And it does make a fairly loud noise, which is something to be aware of if your kiddo does have sensory issues and it&rsquo;s something you want to avoid. Also, and this isn&rsquo;t mentioned on the product description on-line, be aware that you can&rsquo;t replace the brush heads on these. So if you are wanting a permanent electric toothbrush for your kiddos, this isn&rsquo;t the product for you. For us, I just wanted something temporary to start transitioning our son into tolerating the cleaner used at the dentist, so I&rsquo;m totally pleased with what I got. And given the price, even if it dies within a few months, I&rsquo;m not going to be all that upset because it can still be used as a traditional toothbrush. So I think this is a cute product, as long as you don&rsquo;t care which character you get, you understand you can&rsquo;t replace out the brush heads, and I think it&rsquo;s going to be wicked useful in our son&rsquo;s therapy modules.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-for-the-price">Very nice for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great rotating head. Cleans little ones teeth, with the surety of providing a dental cleanse. The only downside to this brush is, it doesn&rsquo;t have interchangeable heads. Meaning this will need replaced every three months, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wanted-elsa-got-a-moose">Wanted Elsa, got a moose.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The toothbrush itself is fine, but Amazon, can you let people choose between the different versions? My daughter asked, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Elsa?&rdquo; and why the snowman and moose were on her toothbrush.The brush head is a bit big and snubby for a small child&rsquo;s mouth. I wish they could make it smaller for the preschool set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-little-girl-and-her-toothbrush">The little girl and her toothbrush!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>She wanted a toothbrush to use when she brushes&hellip;.. and not just any toothbrush but one with two of her favorite character&rsquo;s Anna and Elsa. We ordered one for our house since she took the first one home with her. She uses it each day when she is here and we are proud of that! This tooth brush has proven easily for a child who is almost 3 years old to use. Seeing her two favorite characters made it attractive to her. The fact she can use it on her own helps her to brush and it feels &ldquo;cool&rdquo; &hellip;. because it does a better job than she can reaching to her beautiful and small white teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-toddler">Happy toddler!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>3.5 year old loves this! She will brush twice a day with this toothbrush but not other toothbrushes. Well worth the money. She&rsquo;s never had a cavity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-like-an-awful-waste-imo">Seems like an awful waste IMO</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Aggravated that you <em>CANNOT</em> replace the brush heads. I can&rsquo;t seem to find a child&rsquo;s toothbrush that has replacable heads. Wish the seller would have made this more clear. Seems like an awful waste IMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-so-happy-when-i-received-the-toothbrush">I am so happy when I received the toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so happy when I received the toothbrush. I thought the image in the toothbrush is the same shown in the website, but changed to Elsa and Anna which is definitely a big surprise and bonus for my niece. She loves it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-toothbrush">Nice toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter loves this, but this is for an older child as the brush spins pretty quickly. Not to say it would hurt a toddler who just started brushing their teeth, but they&rsquo;d have to adjust to the spinbrush speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-the-child-is-very-disappointed-be-careful-if-it-does-matter-for">but the child is very disappointed. Be careful if it does matter for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received a brush with Olaf and Swen instead of Anna &amp; Elsa. Of course it was shown in description that characters may vary, but the child is very disappointed.</p>
