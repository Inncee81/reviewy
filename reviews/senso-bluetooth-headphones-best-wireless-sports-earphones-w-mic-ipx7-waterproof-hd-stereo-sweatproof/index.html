<h5 id="fantastic-so-far-took-me-my-surprise">Fantastic so far&hellip;. Took me my surprise !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have time read this review, I think it will help you decide to buy or not. First, I dislike earbuds and find them annoying because they never stayed in my ears. So after going through 3 sets of headphones in one year and damaging them due to sweat and having to clean the headphone pads to avoid them from stinking of dry sweat, I broke down and searched for a pair of earbud style with a clip around the ear to help keep them in place better. Like most of us, I searched for them here on Amazon. There were three things I looked for: one is the reviews, second is that it&rsquo;s fulfilled by Amazon ( so I have some backing if these things are bad ) and third is warranty period for them. Paying $125 to $200 was not what I wanted to spend on name brands that don&rsquo;t deliver and are hyped up for their name, that&rsquo;s just me ! I figured I take a chance on these earbuds for $34.00, and must say I was pleasantly surprised by their performance and quality so far. The sound coming out of these earbuds is just incredible to me. At the gym, I have them paired with my iPhone 5S and at 50% they are loud as hell. I will probably never need to go higher than that . Connection with my iPhone was easy and no issues. The fact that they are sweatproof was a must for me. The 30 ft distance in my home worked fine through 2 walls to the other end of my home. I made calls with them and the mic worked well. I tested the running time of 8 hrs, and it was on point with what they said . The comfort wearing them to my ears was great and guess what they stay in place. The clip around the ear is a soft rubber or silicone material that surprisingly works to help keep the earbuds in my ear. Then you get other little gifts like hard carry case, dual car charger, a short charge cable and 3 foot charge cable that works for as a lightning cable and mirco usb cable&hellip;.. Both will charge the earbuds. Also you get two sets of ear tips small and large and the earbuds have a mid size on them already. My Amazon friends things are mass produced and during production you will have like in any other product defective units that leave the factory, but remember you have a one year warranty and I&rsquo;m sure that they will back it up or Amazon will. All I can say is that after a full week I am very pleased with my purchase and guess what I did, I bought a second pair&hellip;.the gray ones&hellip;.lol ! The only cons I have at the time of this review is that they charge you more for the gray ones, than the red ones, and the earbud pads are little in different in feel from the gray and red earbuds, but in no way is it a deal breaker. At their price point and with what you get these are a very good deal, especially from a unknown brand. I can only see with time how they do, but for now these earbuds rock. I have a one year warranty on them so I&rsquo;m not worried. Wish you all good luck.</p>

<p>I paid full amazonian price for this item, and my views here are strictly based on my experience with the product.Pros:-Insanely good value: comes with car charger, a nice case, different sized earbuds, a dual lighting/micro USB cable, another (shorter) micro USB cable, a coupon and a one year warranty.-The Headphones have tangle-free wire and very soft and comfortable ear loops (unlike the hard plastics that others use).- These sound great, the volume is one of the highest I&rsquo;ve heard on bluetooth, and the sound is punchy, clear and responsive.- Perfect for what I use it for. Gym time&hellip;8hrs of juice gives me about a week of use without having to recharge. They don&rsquo;t move or fall out on any of my workouts.- I have a smart watch, and use this to take calls while I&rsquo;m working out, feel like James Bond. Works really well if you are also using to call or receive calls.Cons:- These aren&rsquo;t $500.00 headphones. If you are an audiophile that is looking for super accurate sound, you will have to shell out to get that. You will get great sound especially if you listen to more bass oriented music.Conclusion: There are few ways to spend ~$30 and get this kind of a haul. I repeat these are great sounding headphones, probably one of the best sounding bluetooth devices I have used. I&rsquo;m very impressed with these headphones, and you will be too.</p>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-it">I absolutely love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love it!!!!! The sound is amazing, it&rsquo;s light and easy to use. The only thing is after about 6-7 hours of use STRAIGHT, it&rsquo;ll start to feel a LITTLE uncomfortable in your ear. To sum it up, it is worth every penny!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my new headphones. I work as a AArrow Sign Spinner. I am very active and my new headphones didn&rsquo;t fall out once plus they lasted my entire 6 hour shift. The photo I provided I am wearing them and I am completely pleased as punch!</p>

<p>TL;DR - Just buy them.Senso&hellip; never heard of them. In fact, I&rsquo;d never have bought a set of earbuds from this company had it not been for my wife who took a chance on a rather inexpensive Christmas gift.Best. Earbuds. Ever.For the price, this is an absolute steal.AUDIO: The audio quality, which is excellent for a set of earbuds, out-performs my wired Bose earbuds and only underperformed in the lower pitches (as a physician, no set of earbuds is safe if they have good bass - no room for the sound waves to escape and only damage your middle ear). I wouldn&rsquo;t use these earbuds to record audio (I do podcasts and digital recording), but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend ANY earbuds for that.COMFORT: I hate earbuds. They HURT. The only set I can use for any extended period of time (on an airplane, for example) is my Bose earbuds. However, Senso&rsquo;s set is a close second and doesn&rsquo;t seem to cause the residual pain other sets (Apple) causes.NOISE CANCELLATION: I&rsquo;m not certain how the noise cancellation works&hellip; I believe it&rsquo;s passive. Nevertheless, I have an Autistic daughter that only I seem to be able to calm and when she&rsquo;s screaming, I can plug these earbuds in and drown out her painful screams without completely drowning out all noise. When I&rsquo;m playing music, it really does seem to work better than my Bose earbuds. I&rsquo;m not sure how it works, but it does.VALUE: How is this possible?! HOW?! This set came with two charging cords (one micro USB and ONE WITH A CONVERTING LIGHTNING/MICRO USB!!!), a car charger with TWO PORTS (1.0A and 2.1A!), replacement ear pieces, and a hard clamshell case. Did I mention it was only $30?!The closest to this I can find on Amazon is a similar set (eerily identical) by Blayz (RobinTronics is missing several items [car charger]). HOWEVER, that set does not come with a convertible Lightning/Micro USB cord and, while it is currently $3-4 cheaper, this cord more than makes up for it.CONCLUSION: FIVE STARS &ndash; If you want a decent set of earbuds, get this one now. It is well worth it.</p>
