</ul>

<p>We all protect our homes against fires and thefts, but, each year, more homes are damaged by small water leaks than larger disasters. Aeotec’s Z-Wave Water Sensor helps you monitor for water leaks and floods and prevent them. Super accurate, it’s capable of measuring as little as 0.03% of an inch of water. Powered by 2 x AAA batteries and with a typical battery life of over 1 year, Water Sensor is compatible with certified Z-Wave gateways including Fibaro, HomeSeer, openHab, Samsung SmartThings, Vera, and Wink.</p>

<h5 id="good-water-sensor-for-wink">Good water sensor for Wink</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good water sensor and it works with Wink. The stock photo shows a short cable but it is much longer. I&rsquo;ve attached some pictures. I have the sensor end attached to a cheap floor alarm for redundancies and for the 100db alarm. Pairing with Wink was easy. It gets it own water sensor icon in the Sensors tab of the Wink App. The sensor will show off line after a few hours of being dry but it will come back online when water is detected. I&rsquo;ve attached some pictures to show the before and after of when water is detected. I have owned this for 20 days and have tested it twice. Each time the response from Wink was about two seconds to get the alert on my phone.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-z-wave-water-sensor-for-monitoring-water-level-such-as-in-a-sump">A great Z-wave water sensor for monitoring water level (such as in a sump)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, I love this sensor! I am using it in conjunction with the Aeon Labs Aeotec Water Smart Energy Power Strip, and it is a LIFE SAVER! I paired this unit to my Samsung SmartThings hub, and when the water sensor detects water in the sump of my aquarium, it automatically shuts down 2 or the outlets on the power strip, which control my return pump and protein skimmer pump. Previously, I had just a simple water alarm, which worked great when you were in the room, but wasn&rsquo;t so great when you weren&rsquo;t home or were sleeping (I COULD hear that alarm from my bedroom with the door closed, but it was faint, and certainly not enough to wake me up). This water sensor is very reasonably priced, and the sensor leads are more than long enough for what I am using it for (I would estimate approximately 2 feet long). It even came with waterproof 3M double-sided tape to mount the sensor (I figured it would only come with normal double-sided tape, so this was a nice surprise).My only complain with the sensor is that though I was able to pair it to my Samsung SmartThings Hub without an issue, the hub recognized it as an open / closed sensor, and not a water sensor. I was able to get it to work for my application like this, but it wasn&rsquo;t ideal. With a little Internet searching, I was able to find the SmartThings IDE for my hub, and change it to a water sensor. Of course, doing so then also required custom code to get it to work the way I wanted. So, if you don&rsquo;t mind it showing up in your &ldquo;Things&rdquo; list as an open / closed sensor, then I would leave it as-is for easy configuration (closed means that water is sensed). For those of you that are a bit more technically savvy, have at the SmartThings IDE, as you&rsquo;ll probably want to familiarize yourself with this utility anyway for future customization of your home automation setup.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="aotec-water-sensors-fortrezz-valve-wink-dry-floors-and-basement">Aotec water sensors + Fortrezz Valve + Wink = dry floors and basement!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I use with Wink system. Works great with Wink Hub2. I have about a dozen deployed, which I bought about a year ago when I was building the new house, and slowly put them up. At first I struggled to pair. THEN, I figured out the trick- having good batteries in the (DUH) and &ldquo;waking up&rdquo; before trying to pair with Wink. What works for me flawlessly now:1. Remove lid.2. Pull plastic tab, pull, reseat batteries.3. Push &ldquo;Wake Up&rdquo; button. If batteries are dead, won&rsquo;t light, won&rsquo;t pair. Change batteries. This fixed my one &ldquo;bad&rdquo; sensor- DOH!4. Do the Wink-Sensor-Add New Sensor-Z wave Sensor routine, and when Wink is flashing at you, then push Z-wave button on the sensor. Pairs in about 10 seconds or less, no hassle!5. When you add new sensors, refresh your Robot to your Water Valve by &ldquo;editing&rdquo; it so that it finds the new sensors. Then when sensor is wet, water is off, you are happy! (And this feature alone will pay for my Wink system over a few years time in the insurance reduced price I get with American Family Home Insurance). « Show LessBattery life: like all the other smart devices in my home, does NOT last a year. Lasts about 6 months so far. But so what; one flooded bathroom or etc every 10 years will cost more than these batteries. Just buy good Alkaline batteries in bulk. Rechargeables might work, but I am afraid the voltage drop off would compromise the signal, and no signal = no sensor = flooded basement, etc.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-great-with-a-little-api-edit">Works great with a little api edit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just go this and works well so far after jumping through a hoop or two to part it correctly to my smartthings hub. Now it is alerting my properly and giving me the battery life. This came with 2 screws or some 3m tape to mount it.This thing originally showed as a door sensor. But if you follow the below steps it should pair correctly with the a little edit in the api.1) Re-connect the devices to your SmartThings network 2) Log into the IDE @ (&hellip;)3) Click on My Devices at the top of the screen 4) Click on either of your moisture sensors 5) Click on the Edit Button 6) Click on the Type drop down list and select Z-Wave Water Sensor 7) Click Update 8) Repeat for the other devcie 9) you may have to force close your mobile app or log in and out again for the changes to take placeIf that doesn&rsquo;t work, there is a device type handler in the SmartThings Community that claims to work with the Aeon Water Sensor.</p>

<h5 id="z-wave-leak-sensor-works-with-wink">Z-Wave Leak Sensor works with WINK</h5>

<p>Great device for detecting water leaks with a quick response. Z-Wave and works with WINK home automation.</p>

<h5 id="great-if-you-are-not-getting-the-probe-wet-on-a-semi-regular-basis">Great if you are not getting the probe wet on a semi regular basis</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 2 of these, one to detect leaks around my aquarium and one to detect water level in a skimmer overflow to trigger an off command for the skimmer pump to avoid water on my floor. This worked like a charm for the first couple of months however, I have had to order a replacement for the one that gets wet on a semi regular basis since it is now at a stage where it is reporting false positives every few hours and will no longer work for my application. I realize what I am using this for is likely a little out of the norm but would expect a $42.00 water sensor to be able to get wet more than a few dozen times before going bad hence the 4 stars.</p>
