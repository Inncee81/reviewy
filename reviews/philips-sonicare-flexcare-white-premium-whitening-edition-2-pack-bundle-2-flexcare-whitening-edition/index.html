<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="awesome-upgraded-toothbrush">Awesome upgraded toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I brought this toothbrush to upgrade from an older model of the same brand. I loved that toothbrush (just a basic sonic care model) and I really love this toothbrush.Thankfully I was used to a sonic care toothbrush, it is normal to have some gum sensitivity and even a little bleeding when going from Manuel brushing to an electric toothbrush, because this toothbrush is powerful. You really get that fresh from the dentist feel after brushing with this toothbrush. This set came with two brush handles, two brush diamond clean brush heads, a charger, a charger with brush sanitizer and two travel cases. A huge package deal! I could not be happier (unless it was free or something which it was not).There are several settings for the toothbrush: clean, white, massage, go clean, and max clean. I usually go for the max clean which is a 3 minute cycle but there are shorter cycles if you are in a hurry. Not that 3 minutes is that much time. The brush vibrates differently for the different cycles. I have really noticed a difference in my visits to the dentist and overall tooth and gum health since I began using a sonic care toothbrush. The toothbrush holds the charge for quite a while before you have to charge it again and then I usually just charge it overnight and it is ready to go in the morning.I love the new sanitizer feature on this model. You just pop the brush head into the sanitizer, hit the button and 10 minutes later it is germ free. Yay. The travel cases are great too. I always carry my sonicare when I travel. The case is great and keeps everything clean. The toothbrush and head fit into spaces that are specifically designed for them and they stay put. I mean there really is nothing negative to say about this toothbrush. Get it. Clean your teeth. You will love it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="average-quality">Average quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UV sanitizer didn&rsquo;t last two months. Absolute junk!Update: it magically started working again = a couple more stars. Still questionable quality though. Will update review if it lasts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-my-old-electric-toothbrush">Better than my old electric toothbrush.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush exceeded the performance of my previous electric toothbrush. The system included more charging adapters for home and travel use, although I have not used the travel charger yet. The brush design gets in between teeth as well as the enamel on tooth surfaces to brighten and remove food particles and debris that my old brush missed. I am pleased with the resulting clean white look that comes with using the Flexcare White system for oral hygiene.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-toothbrushes-out-there">Best toothbrushes out there!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are absolutely great! We purchased this as a couple, and it is great that each one has an individual symbol to help keep them straight. The charging station is great to use. We know we are getting the best clean and taking care of ourselves by using this brand and quality toothbrushes. You really can&rsquo;t beat them. Our dentist recommended these, and I am glad he did. We aren&rsquo;t just helping our teeth now, but we are investing in our longterm dental health. They really make a difference!</p>

<h5 id="this-one-seems-to-clean-better-than-my-previous-philis-sonicare">This one seems to clean better than my previous Philis Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This one seems to clean better than my previous Philis Sonicare, which developed horrible smells and had to be discarded. Hoping that the sterilizer will make it last longer than the last one did.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decided-to-give-this-a-try-and-i-love-it-it-just-feels-like-it-cleans-so">decided to give this a try and I love it! It just feels like it cleans so &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had the Oral B for several years, decided to give this a try and I love it! It just feels like it cleans so much better. It does have a little longer cleaning timer as well but brush strokes are so much better</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UV Sanitizer stopped working after a month. Philips however is replacing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buzzing-issue-online-workaround-fixed-temporarily">Buzzing Issue&ndash;online workaround fixed temporarily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought ours about 6 months ago. It took about 2 weeks before mine started buzzing really loudly. We found a work-around that solved the issue, tightening a screw inside the toothbrush, but it only worked for a short time (maybe a month?) My husbands toothbrush is great!! (He traded me for my lousy one.) I would be fine with it if it weren&rsquo;t so expensive&ndash;that&rsquo;s not quite a disposable price. It&rsquo;s a fantastic clean but I bet my neighbors can hear the one toothbrush. I think we got a faulty product. My husbands toothbrush even feels more powerful, buzzing aside. I would give 5 stars for his toothbrush but 0 for mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>one of the toothbrushes burned out within three months</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this (and other Sonicares) saved my teeth and my health.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-product">Well made product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased two of these back in 2011, both failed after a couple of months, but were replaced very promptly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-investment-in-your-dental-health">Perfect investment in your dental health!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didnt I buy this sooner! Make an investment in your dental health and buy this right away! As we get older it gets harder to keep the tarter from returning and this toothbrush&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-good-love-the-little-plastic-toothbrush-top-that-keeps">so good. Love the little plastic toothbrush top that keeps &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, so good. Love the little plastic toothbrush top that keeps brush free of sprays, etc., used in the bathroom.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>fine</p>

<h5 id="home-run">Home Run!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>2nd one because we left in Ireland. Changed our mouth care in a very positive way. Can&rsquo;t stand to use regular toothbrush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Swear by these toothebrushes!!! Definitely worth the investment</p>
