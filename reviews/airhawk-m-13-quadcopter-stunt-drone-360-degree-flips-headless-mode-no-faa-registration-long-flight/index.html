<h5 id="i-figured-for-it-s-price-it-would-be-a-good-beginner-quadcopter-for-me-but-didn-t-expect-too-much">I figured for it&rsquo;s price it would be a good beginner quadcopter for me but didn&rsquo;t expect too much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this quadcopter/drone with an expectation of the quality. I figured for it&rsquo;s price it would be a good beginner quadcopter for me but didn&rsquo;t expect too much. I have flown many RC helicopters when I was a kid and was hoping to get back into it. The product construction is pretty rough to start. It is cheap plastic and one of the blade guards I found was cracked when I opened the box. The controller would not turn on initially. I tried changing the batteries and looking on line for answers but nothing worked. I eventually gave the controller a little shake and the power light flickered on but if I moved it around it would power off. I am assuming there was a problem with the internal wiring. I was able to fly it both inside and out while being very careful with the controller. It does not hover and is nearly un-flyable both inside and out. Too big and unpredictable for indoors and the slightest wind would toss it to the ground or throw it 20 feet outside. Amazon was helpful when contacted and offered a new controller or a refund. I chose to return it and purchase a different product from a different company. I would not recommend this for beginners or any skill level.</p>

<h5 id="that-dog-sure-does-jump-high">That dog sure does jump high!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had heard someone else mentioning this on an RC site. They were going on and on about how awesome this drone was. Now with drones becoming so popular I saw that it was fairly well priced so I decided to purchase it. I didn&rsquo;t have too high of an expectation because I had purchased similar items before, usually not living up to my expectations. This was surprisingly well made. Now I&rsquo;m not the best pilot but these do come in handy when needing to keep the kids ir husband occupied. Well as any husband would, he decided to instigate the dog with it. He had always joked about dropping parachutes and water balloons from his old one. A &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if&rdquo; moment. Well the 120 lb dog jumps higher than we thought. Now my husband is in need of a plastic welder. It&rsquo;s not horribly damaged but it will need some TLC until it can fly the friendly skies again.</p>
