<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-bargain">A bargain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We use this mounted at the end of a 12 foot jib for our crane shots. It supports a loaded Sony HVR-Z5U with matte box and cables. We bought the remote and cable extension to make everything work with the crane. The control on the remote requires you develop a certain &lsquo;touch&rsquo;, but once learned, the head is a joy to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-bang-for-the-buck-and-it-s-a-diy-ers-dream">Terrific bang for the buck, and it&rsquo;s a DIY&rsquo;ers dream</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first thing I did when the MP101 arrived was to take apart the base and modify the head so I could get a full 360 degree rotation (plenty of info on the web for this.) That took about 10 minutes. Sure, the cable is attached, so you have to be cautious about winding it too tight. If I plan on anything than 360 degrees, I&rsquo;ll actually counterwind the cable around the head so it unwinds as I pan. Yes, this disables the automatic panning, but I never intended on using that feature.The slider provides some slow to fast control, but you can modify this (again check online) by playing with the power source. Doing so can increase or decrease the overall speed. This is important if you&rsquo;re using a telephoto / zoom lens. Lowering the voltage will slow the head down considerably - too low and it won&rsquo;t power up. Again, just search the web.You can use the head as is, or easily modify it for your own use.99% of the people who buy the MP101 are happy with it as is, but some want more control over the speed and rotation. It&rsquo;s an easy head to modify and customize, or of course just leave as is. It&rsquo;s one of the most versatile heads out there.</p>

<h5 id="i-was-very-pleased-with-the-product-it-was-perfect-for-using">I was very pleased with the product - it was perfect for using &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this pan head for about 2.5 years, but it has only seen light use (probably under 20 total uses). For the price, I was very pleased with the product - it was perfect for using on a crane (I bought the extension cable for the remote) and took my videos to a new level of smoothness. It is definitely a legitimate complaint about the speed - too slow for many applications, though I learned to live with it. The remote does feel much cheaper than the rest of the product, and I suspect that it is what has failed on me today, causing me to write this review as a cautionary measure to those who might purchase this product. While functioning, I would rate it a 4-star product, maybe even a 4.5 (cheap remote and slow speed keeping it from 5-star rating), but based on my limited number of uses and extreme care when using it (have kept it in packaging), I have to ding it to a 3. I am not sure if it is the unit or remote that has failed (it no longer moves up or down, left-right is fine), but for either one to fail with the limited use I gave this product, I am not terribly pleased.I suspect the remote as the culprit for 2 reasons: #1, it IS a very cheap piece of plastic, very lightweight and not on par with the head. #2, it can be yours for the low price of forty bucks. If it was ten bucks, you could buy it and keep on smiling, but for it to be forty bucks means that they know that you will need to replace it and are trying to make money off of a bad product. That is a bit unethical to me (I don&rsquo;t use that word lightly), and I really would like to rate it a 1 or 2 for that alone, but because it has been a very useful product for me at a VERY good price point, I feel comfortable with a 3 rating. If I had used this thing hard for a week or 2 and it gave out (which could be very possible for someone, hence my warning), it would definitely be a 1-star product. The remote (whether or not it is faulty - which remains to be seen as I probably grudgingly order one) should not be over a third of the cost of the product.</p>

<h5 id="good-value-but-limited-uses">Good value, but limited uses.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It gets the job done and it&rsquo;s affordable. It isn&rsquo;t great though.I do video production for a living, so I have a lot of camera equipment. On my 14 foot jib I have a professional grade motorized pan-tilt head that cost a couple thousand dollars. Obviously, this pan-tilt head doesn&rsquo;t compare to something like that. It does, however, get the job done.I bought this in order to make shot adjustments to a lightweight camcorder that I couldn&rsquo;t personally stand right next to and operate. For that it works great, so I am happy I bought it.I wouldn&rsquo;t use it for anything else though. Here is why- It is very slow. The remote has a speed control that lets you adjust from slow to fast. In reality though the speeds could better be described as slow and slower. It doesn&rsquo;t start or stop smoothly, it is a very abrupt instant start and stop. If you are planning on using this to orchestrate camera moves while the camera is live you would probably be disappointed. For adjusting the camera between shots though, it will work. Also, the tilt range is very limited. Build quality also leaves room for improvement. It feels cheap and plastic-y.Overall, I would say that if you are like me and just need something to make shot adjustments on a camera that would otherwise be stuck on a tripod unable to move, it is great. Using it for live camera moves, larger cameras, where you need to adjust quickly, or need a good range of tilt and pan this probably isn&rsquo;t the product for you.For the price, it is a very good deal. You really can&rsquo;t expect something in this price range to compete with pro systems costing thousands of dollars. Depending on what the job is, it can get it done. Just don&rsquo;t expect too much from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes your the only person producing a shoot and framing the right shot can be challenging in that type of situation that&rsquo;s where this Pan Head can make all the difference at least for me that is. Because its motorized and comes with a wired remote you can pan and tilt your camera, smartphone (some take fantastic photos and video) or in my case camcorder, you can position your lens where you need to direct it perfectly. Do your self a favor like I did and get yourself one of these alsoÂ Bescor Motorized Pan Head 20&rsquo; Extension Cordfor extended range heck, they even have a 50&rdquo; for even more range! One more thing I have owned this for 3 years now and I&rsquo;m just getting around to making a review so that should tell you something about the quality.</p>

<p>It is a nice product for videomakers, nevertheless a remote wireless RF control is strongly required at least as accessory.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good enough. But for me there is one cons - the slowest speed of pan is still too high. Maybe for landscapes it will work fine. But indoor I can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
