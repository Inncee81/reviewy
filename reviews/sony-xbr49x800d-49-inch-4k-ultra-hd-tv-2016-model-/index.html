<h5 id="best-settings-for-ps4-pro-hdr-and-non-hdr-gaming">Best settings For ps4 pro hdr and non hdr gaming</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tv is absolutely beautiful, 10 out of 10 would buy again. In my days of research to find the best tv that would best fit me I came to this tv. I have both the 43 inch and 49 inch. I like the brightness and the color better on the 43 inch. The 49 is a close second. I have both side by side at the moment.I&rsquo;m going to be sharing with you all my settings for the PS4 for the best looking picture and a point in the right direction for calibrating it yourself.This tv is phenomenal when it comes to PS4 (soon to be PS4 pro) and Xbox one S gamingThe hdr on this is absolutely mezmorizing. On the Xbox one s the settings to get the color to really pop are a little messed up (microsofts problem their aware fix is going to be coming soon) at least it is with forza horizon 3 so I can&rsquo;t really tell you what settings to put on the xbox one s. But for PS4 make sure you go to settings-external input- and go all the way down to hdmi signal format and click enhanced format Both for the 43 and 49 inch.this setting makes hdr gaming look stunning on battlefield 1, battlefront, and infamous second son.(only games I&rsquo;ve tested thus far)-43 inch settings for PS4-This is in Game mode.Next I have brightness:32Contrast:65Gamma: 0Black level: 50Black adjust: mediumAdv. contrast enhancer: mediumNext color:60Hue:0Color temperature: I have mine on warm.Adv. color temperature: more on that later.Live color:offSharpness:63Reality creation: manualResolution:30Motion: everything off or grayed outVideo options- HDR mode: OnHdmi video range:fullColor space I left at autoNow on the advanced color option I copied what [&hellip;] hadyou can click that link and scroll down and there are 10 different points you have to go through. I don&rsquo;t notice much of a difference besides my whites looking a tad better. Just follow what they did for that part and it may look better. Everyone&rsquo;s tv is different.Now the 49 inch was much different than the 43 inch in terms of how the color looked and brightness with the 43 inch settings on the 49. So I also calibrated the 49inch.On the 49 inch I have done mode: Photo VividBrightness:maxContrast:75Gamma:1Black level:55Black adjust: mediumAdvanced contrast enhancer: mediumColor:60Color temperature: NeturalAdvanced color temperature: same as rtings.com(made whites look better for this tv as well.Live color:offSharpness: 60Reality creation: manualResolution:30Motion:off everything grayedHdr mode: onHdmi video: range fullColor space: autoI found these above settings best for the 49 inch to get the brightness up and leave colors still looking great! It&rsquo;s no where near as bright as the 43 inch for some reason. But the 49 does look very good still. I&rsquo;m still going to be doing more tweaking as I can to both the 43 and 49 but right now that&rsquo;s the best I have.Hope this helps make your tv as good as it&rsquo;s made mine!Again both my tvs were very different in terms of how it made the picture using the same settings that&rsquo;s why I have both tv settings so hopefully this matches both the 43 inch or 49 inch tvs you have in terms of refining the picture quality. Enjoy!January 29th, 2016 update!The PS4 pro has updated firmware that came out recently and those old settings are no good anymore so on with the new! Here are my updated settings for everyone, enjoyFor non hdr &ldquo;which is most games right now&rdquo; 43inchPicture mode:gameBrightness:30Contrast:maxGamma:0Black level:53Black adjust: offAdv contrast enhancer:offColor:68 (to me this looks best for gaming, especially battlefield 1.Color temp: neutralAdv color: I&rsquo;m still using rtingsLive color:mediumSharpness:50Reality creation:100 ( this makes things look 10000 times better. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s not already on.)Motionflow: off and everything greyed out.Video options all auto.Hdr content still 43 inch: like infamous second son and uncharted 4Picture mode:gameBrightness:40Contrast:maxGamma:0Black level:53Black adjust:offAdv contrast enhancer:0Color:68Color temp:neutralAdv color temp: rtingsLive color:mediumSharpness:50Reality creation- manualResolution:maxMotionflow:off everything else off or greyed outAll video options autoAgain this is hdr supporting games like infamous second son and uncharted 4.Now for the 49 inch! Non hdr settingsPicture mode:gameBrightness:45Contrast:maxGamma:1Black level:60Black adjust: offAdvanced contrast enhancer: offColor:65Color temp:neutralAdv color temp: rtings settingsLive color:mediumSharpness:50Reality creation: maxMotionflow off and everything greyed outVideo options all autoNow hdr games like uncharted and infamous second son!Picture mode:gameBrightness: maxContrast:maxGamma:2Black level:60Black adjust: offAdv contrast enhancer:offColor:65Color temp: neutralAdv color temp:rtings settingsLive color:mediumSharpness:50Reality creation: manualResolution:100Motionflow: off everything greyed outVideo options everything auto because it&rsquo;s already going to be showing you hdr for your hdr gamesOkay now this is new and I found these settings for the 49inch to help a lot With my brightness and black levels. It&rsquo;s not advised you do this to your tv but your Sony x800d has a service menu you can access by first having your tv off then pressing display followed by 5 followed by volume up then power on your tv remote.Go to panel/pq then to wb adjustmemtHere you can play with the colors and correct them to your preference. I used my 43 inch to help me calibrate my 49 inch. Because my 43 inch already looks so good I left all my colors at 512The 49 inch I haveR wb gain:520G wb gain:517B wb gain:532R wb offset:523G wb offset:516B wb offset:532Then press the home button to exit from the settings as there&rsquo;s nothing else to look/change here.I found these settings to almost match what my 43 inch looks like. It helps a lot I&rsquo;m not sure if these exact settings will help you but my 49 inch blues reds greens and whites didn&rsquo;t look that good compared to my 43 inch. I dug around and did a lot of research and spent about an hour to get the colors where I wanted them. I would recommend just copying my settings. If they make your tv worse just bring them all back to 512. Don&rsquo;t toy around with the settings to much because it could damage your tv.Enjoy and I&rsquo;m glad I can help you all out :)</p>

<p>We initially purchased a 50” Samsung UN50KU6300FXZA and tried that out for about a week (from a big box store). We really liked that TV, but we were having a problem with occasional audio skips on that TV so we ended up returning it and exchanging it for a Sony XBR-49X800D. I am not really sure that the Samsung had audio issues itself, it could have been something external (I ended up replacing a lot of cables and connectors as well).Since I ended up trying out both TVs, I can contrast them to some extent. The Samsung is a very stylish TV and looks a bit more upscale than the Sony. The pedestal seems a bit more stable, although both of them, being center stands versus the more common feet on either end, worked well with my TV stand. The Sony, on the other hand, is amazingly thin for a 49-50” TV, more-so than the Samsung.I tried the audio on both and I thought the built-in audio on the Samsung was a bit better, although for me it’s a moot point since I am using a Yamaha sound bar connected to digital audio out on the TV.There was something very pleasing about the picture on the Samsung, although the contrast and colors seem a bit better on the Sony, given proper adjustment on both.On the Samsung, when I had the motion smoothing and judder control features turned on, some broadcasts had a serious problem with the infamous soap opera effect and I found that, to avoid this and have a picture I liked I had to turn most of that stuff off. On the Sony, on the other hand, I am using some (not all) of those settings and I am not getting the soap opera effect like I did on the Samsung.I liked the “smart” features, including the arrangement of the user interface, a bit better on the Samsung than on the Sony, it was a tad more intuitive (although the features were similar).The Sony seems to have more settings for adjusting the picture and audio than the Samsung did, although I liked the interface for doing that better on the Samsung.The Samsung remote is small, elegant and confusing. The Sony remote is more traditional and has a lot of buttons on it (the Samsung remote hardly had any).Both TVs seem to work fine on my WiFi network and both were able to stream 4K content just fine (e.g. Netflix).The Sony has 4 HDMI ports vs 3 on the Samsung.The Sony TV uses an external brick on the power cord like a laptop (a big one), the Samsung has a normal power cord.The cables on the Samsung all plugged in from the side (in the back, but parallel to the back of the TV), the Sony cables plug into the back perpendicular to it (I don’t hang my TV on the wall, it’s on a stand, but I think the Samsung would have worked better for hanging on the wall).All in all, I don’t think you can go wrong with either set, they are both good TVs.For those that are interested, I spent a lot of time fooling with the settings on this TV to find something that I thought was &ldquo;great&rdquo; for all types of media and viewing (I don&rsquo;t like to flip between modes like Sports, etc, depending on what I am viewing). As to what I mean by &ldquo;great&rdquo;, I like the picture to have colors that pop (but not over saturated) and to have a lot of contrast. I like it to look bright as well. Here is what I ended up with:Picture Mode: CustomAuto Picture Mode: OffBrightness: 47Color: 58Light Sensor: OnAdvanced Picture Settings- Brightness* Brightness: 47* Contrast: 96* Gamma: 1* Black Level: 47* Black Adjust: Low* Adv contrast enhance: Medium (or Low)- Color* Color 58* Hue 0* Color Temp Warm* Adv Color Temp- R-Gain: Max- G-Gain: -1- B-Gain: -1- R-Bias: 1- G-Bias: 0- B-Bias: 0* Live Color: Low- Clarity* Sharpness: 55* Reality Creation: Auto- Resolution: 20* Mastered in 4K: Off* Random noise reduction: Off* Digital noise reduction: Low- Motion* Motionflow: Custom- Smoothness: 3- Clearness: 1- CineMotion: Auto- Video options* HDR mode: Auto* HDMI video range: Auto* Color space: Auto</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy with this tv except for one thing. The Bluetooth will not connect to Bluetooth headphones. I didn&rsquo;t expect Bluetooth on the TV when I bought it so I will not take a star away, but it makes no sense to disable this function. I paid $648 for this TV and at that price it was well worth it. I tried 2 different $500 4k 49&rdquo; tvs and the picture was horrible. This TV looks great. Not as good as my OLED but for the price it was well worth it.</p>
