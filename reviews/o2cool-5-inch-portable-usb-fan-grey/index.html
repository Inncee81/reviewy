<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="clicking-sound-resolved-i-love-this-fan">Clicking sound - RESOLVED! I love this fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got the fan today and it is making a horrible clicking sound when turned on. Sounds like one of the fan blades is hitting the plastic somewhere, but I can&rsquo;t tell for sure. No matter what I do, I can&rsquo;t get the clicking to stop. I hope the one I got is just defective. I really like this fan. It&rsquo;s a nice size and very powerful. The only problem is the clicking sound. I&rsquo;ve sent an order into Amazon to have it replaced. Hopefully the next one works fine. I will update my review when that one comes in.Update: Ok, so my replacement came in the mail today and I am happy to say that this one does not have the clicking problem that the first one has. Since that is the case, this fan is now perfect. It is small and compact which makes it great for travel, and yet its a very powerful fan given its size. I really like that it can run on either batteries or usb. I also really like that it has a high or low setting. The fan is relatively quite compared to most fans so you don&rsquo;t have to worry much about it disturbing your coworkers if you happen to use it as a desk fan. My purpose for buying this fan, however, is so I can take it with me when I travel abroad. I&rsquo;m one of those people who can&rsquo;t sleep with out a fan, and this fan here was the perfect solution!</p>

<h5 id="hot-flashes-be-gone">Hot flashes be-gone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had originally found this product at Lowes. After a few days I returned to Lowes, with the sole purpose of clearing their shelves of this fan, however, to my dismay, there were none left&hellip;anywhere! So I did what any determined woman would do, and I went straight to the 02Cool CFO, and she sadly announced to me that they do not retail their product. The CFO referred to a few other retailers, and I found this seller to have the exact model I needed, and for only a few dollars more. This fan is awesome, it does have two speeds, which for a desk, or better yet, for a person experiencing a hot flash, this fan is your guy. It folds for travel, and uses three sources of energy; 4 AA batteries, USB adapter, or even the ol&rsquo; fashion outlet in the wall. This fan provides enough power to cool even the hottest hot flash.Be weary though of other look-alikes, even with the same 02Cool name, they are not the same model as this one. The other 02Cool model has only one speed and no wall adapter.I use this fan at my work desk, on my night stand, even while I am officiating a wedding ceremony, this fan is wonderful.If you are needing a blow-your-hair-in-the-wind type of fan, this not your fan, try a commercial-use fan&hellip;.I am sure you will be windier and happier with that type.</p>

<h5 id="great-fan-horrible-engineering-on-the-adapter-port">Great Fan! Horrible engineering on the adapter/port</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own several of these fans. Can&rsquo;t live without now that I&rsquo;m the hot flash Queen! The A/C adapter plug that fits into the port on the base of the fan does not hold tight so it comes out all the time. Drives me a bit nutty, but I do love that it can run from regular electricity rather than always putting in new DD batteries like my other two fans. I read a review that talked about the plug&hellip;I agree with the other person&hellip;It&rsquo;s like the adapter plus isn&rsquo;t made to really fit the port. I&rsquo;ll put up with it, but I don&rsquo;t love that feature. I think it&rsquo;s got great air movement for my needs. I don&rsquo;t love blasts of air blowing on me anyway. I love that it has a lower and higher power setting. Depending on the amount of heat I&rsquo;m dealing with I can control that. I also really love that the face is adjustable. I can get it to just about any angle I need. Perfect for the bathroom counter and kitchen counter. I can keep on working away and not skip a beat. It can fold down flat too&hellip;.great for travel and putting away when I don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-after-3-weeks-of-limited-use">Dead after 3 weeks of limited use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was nice for about 3 weeks. I liked that this newer version had low and high settings compared to my older one that has one setting. I had it next to my bed for a little breeze in the evenings. I came home, tried to turn it on after the 3rd week and it was dead. I tried alt cables, alt power sources and it was burned out. I have an older O2 Cool fan on my desk at work that&rsquo;s the same size which I bought from RiteAid and it&rsquo;s worked for 2 yrs. I won&rsquo;t buy this model again.</p>

<h5 id="use-this-when-i-travel-because-i-get-hot-easily-and-this-plugs-in-nicely-to-my-laptop-and">&hellip; use this when I travel because I get hot easily and this plugs in nicely to my laptop and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this when I travel because I get hot easily and this plugs in nicely to my laptop and stands on its own. I don&rsquo;t use the batteries but that is a great function that I will have to start using. It takes 4 AAs which can get quite pricey. The main reason it&rsquo;s not a 5 star review even though I&rsquo;m happy with it, is because the usb cord that plugs into it is defective after only a few month of use. It has to be in just the right position to work otherwise it goes in and out. I really just need a new cord, but I feel like I got what I paid for it.<strong><em>update&hellip; it&rsquo;s been a few months and the fan works off and on depending on the position of the cord. I&rsquo;m getting a different brand to replace this.</em></strong> update: I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this again. It&rsquo;s completely shot even with batteries.</p>

<h5 id="good-little-desktop-fan">Good little desktop fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan has been very convenient for me to use at work where they prohibit personal electronics that need to be plugged into an outlet. Also prohibited to use personal USB devices. It is a bit noisy on the high setting with fresh batteries which was to be expected. The sound becomes more like white noise after awhile so it&rsquo;s not bothersome. 4 brand new AA Energizer batteries lasted me a few weeks (approximately 30 hours of use each week) on low-high speed till the fan started to die out. Not bad for a $11 product imo. The green is not as bright in real life as it is in the photo which looks more neon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-cute-and-works-well">Super Cute and Works Well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s super cute. I was hoping the grey plastic would be a little darker and less &ldquo;cheap looking&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s okay.It has many positions too, which was unexpected, so you can angle it many ways.So far, I&rsquo;ve got it on the lowest setting and there&rsquo;s cool air blowing nicely at me.I&rsquo;ve got it USB attached at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-fan">Nice little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already had one of these fans and purchased this one for my sister-in-law as she borrowed mine while visiting and loved it. I need the white noise from a fan in order to fall asleep. I travel a lot for work and this fan works perfectly while I&rsquo;m away. I also keep one in my office plugged into my computer so I can turn it on when the office gets too warm. Perfect size for traveling a perfect air flow or the size!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exceeds-expectations-for-the-price">Exceeds expectations for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First day i brought it to work, where im a call center rep, only used low speed mode but was very nice. Definitely recommend this fan for that kind of job as its basically silent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-collapses-onto-itself-so-it-is-easy-to-travel-with-if-needed">it collapses onto itself so it is easy to travel with if needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had the chance to play with this fan and wow does it put out a lot of air flow for what it is. The fan is small, it collapses onto itself so it is easy to travel with if&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-option-for-the-office">Good option for the office.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a simple fan that you can plug into your USB port on your laptop. I use it at the office, as I go to the gym during my lunch break and often need to cool down afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-quiet">Too quiet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the fan. However, it could be louder to drown out my husbands snoring!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unit died a month after purchase, cord connections were very flimsy.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-it-s-great">Love this, it&rsquo;s great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Live this and use it all the time!!</p>

<h5 id="feels-cheaply-made">Feels cheaply made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a light weight portable fan that works with either USB or batteries. I thought this might be a nice addition to my car camping equipment for hot summer nights.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-small-fan-that-is-powered-by-ac-batteries-or-usb-what-more-needs-to-be-said">It&rsquo;s a small fan that is powered by AC, batteries, or USB. What more needs to be said? :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a ton to say about this review, really. It&rsquo;s a small fan. I think virtually every human being in the civilized world knows what a fan is.</p>

<h5 id="this-puts-a-little-wind-in-your-face">This puts a little wind in your face.</h5>

<h5 id="i-am-very-disappointed-with-this-product">I am very disappointed with this product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very disappointed with this product. I bought this fan on March 14, 2016 and on today April 6 2017 the fan completely died and won&rsquo;t turn back on.</p>
