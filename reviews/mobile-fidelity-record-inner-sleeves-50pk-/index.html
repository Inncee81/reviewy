<p>When dealing with rare and expensive records, sometimes standard paper inner sleeves just don&rsquo;t cut it. If you really want to protect your vinyl in the best sleeves possible, go for the premium Mofi Master Sleeves. These imported, anti-static sleeves are similar to rice paper and feature three-ply thickness. The back construction consists of a paper layer sandwiched between two sheets of high-density polythylene (HDPE) with a translucent HDPE front. Comes in a pack of 50.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-good-sleeves-but-i-like-the-disckeeper-audiophile-sleeves-better-for-just-a-little-more">These are good sleeves, but I like the DiscKeeper Audiophile Sleeves better for just a little more $$.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I primarily use three types of inner record sleeves:1) The DiscKeeper 2.0 Anti-static sleeves - you can get these for $9.99 + $3 Media Mail shipping direct from Sleeve City, or here on Amazon for $14.99 Prime. I use these for the bulk of my lesser - mid value vinyl and they are good utility sleeve for a fair price. They are a 2.0 mil sleeve, and I don&rsquo;t try to slide them into the record jacket sleeve, as they tend to crumple up. I put the record jacket into the outer protective sleeve, then slide this sleeve with the record in it external to record jacket. Makes for easier access to the vinyl, as you don&rsquo;t have to pull the entire record jacket out of the out protective sleeve to play the record.2) These MoFi Sleeves - they just a tad thicker than the DiscKeeper 2.0, and have one side opaque and backed with a lining to make the sleeve a little more rigid. I use them the same way as the DiscKeeper 2.0, and don&rsquo;t try to slide these into the record jacket - they are also a little thin for this. They are a little higher quality than the 2.0&rsquo;s, and for the extra money proved a little better manageability.3) The DiscKeeper Audiophile sleeves. These are a little more than $$ than these Mofi sleeves, you can get the Audiophile sleeve for $19.99 plus $3 shipping direct from Sleeve City. But, for my needs, the Audiophile sleeves are worth the little extra expense if you want maximum protection for your more cherished vinyl. The Audiophile sleeves are backed on one side with a thick &ldquo;rice&rdquo; paper stock sandwiched between polyethylene, but the inner portion is still polyethylene so it offers good protection. It is also easier to slide the Audiophile sleeve into the record jacket if you wish, because the added thickness / rigidity means they do not want to crumple up as easily and slide in much better. I like these sleeves a lot for the money, and I prefer to use these for my high valued vinyl.I still like these MoFi sleeves, and own 100 of them - but for the price, and if I had to choose based on price to value, I would choose the DiscKeeper Audiophile sleeve (#3) for my higher valued vinyl, and then choose the DiscKeeper 2.0 (#1) for a more utility sleeve.Your mileage may vary, mine is just an opinion and not right or wrong, so choose based on your own criteria.Thanks for reading.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="these-sleeves-will-in-sure-that-my-old-records-have-the-best-possible-protection">These sleeves will in sure that my old records have the best possible protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who is seriously into vinyl collecting. I decided to sort through my old collection of several hundred DJ records from the late 90s early 2000&rsquo;s. Most of the records originally came with paper inner sleeves, some of the wreckage didn&rsquo;t even come with inner sleeves. Most of the songs aren&rsquo;t anything special, but there are a few that have some real nostalgic value to me. These sleeves will in sure that my old records have the best possible protection. These sleaves do not have the label window punch out. That may or may not matter to you.If you know anything about vinyl, then you probably aren&rsquo;t even reading these reviews because you already know what the best sleeves are and have already added these to your cart. If you are on the fence or are trying to find the best sleeves&hellip; then a quick Internet search form mobile fidelity master sleeves will show you what the serious collectors think&hellip; which is that these are awesome.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-record-protection">Perfect Record Protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has been a multiple purchase for me. I love these sleeves and repeat an order for when I run out. The static protection and the quality plastic used cannot be beat. I have read some say they do not fit into album covers. I beg to differ. They ARE snug in fit. With some covers, one has to really be patient and wriggle them in so as not to get jammed in the cover. On the positive, it assures that a tight seal is there to protect against any stray contaminants, and yet allowing some breathing room so as not to form mould.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="purchased-two-packs">Purchased two packs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great to use to protect my records. I&rsquo;ve been going through all my old albums and replacing the paper Inner sleeves with these to protect my vinyl. Easy to use, records go in and sleeve into cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have">A must have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a vinyl collector, you already know by now that the paper inner sleeves that come with records are terrible. They scratch up the disc, they create static, they tear and leave tiny paper fragments in the grooves.. Just awful. These sleeves are the only inner sleeves I&rsquo;ll ever use now that I&rsquo;ve found them. Not the cheapest option but definitely worth that few extra dollars to protect your collection from skipping amen sounding bad when under the needle. GRAB THESE!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mobile-fidelity-inner-sleeves">Mobile Fidelity Inner Sleeves</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recommended by many in the vinyl community, MoFi are worth the investment for your records. They are the ONLY company I&rsquo;ll use for my inner sleeves for my record collection. No scuff, anti-static polyliners that will do a great job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-felicitations-sleeve-labourers">My Felicitations, Sleeve Labourers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>High quality, the best replacement sleeve solution I could have hoped for as I encounter more and more plastic film covers from my now aging vinyl collection beginning to crumble. So these MFSL sleeves are going to protect the collection for the next 40 years and perhaps beyond, and its great to have a stash of 50 at the ready. I will certainly reorder these in the 100&rsquo;s as I am sure to encounter lots of deteriorating vintage sleeves that will need replacing, typical of some vintage troves of vinyl albums. The MFSL sleeves have an &ldquo;archival&rdquo; quality feel to them and are the ideal product for an important job. Not surprising to see the high quality point of this product, as that is what MFSL has built its overall reputation upon – they know their $#@%!</p>

<h5 id="these-are-really-good-have-had-no-issues-with-a-record-not">These are really good, have had no issues with a record not &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really good, have had no issues with a record not fitting, no weird dust or particles inside of them, none of them have ripped, they are a bit on the skinny side, so they tend to crumple a bit if the cardboard sleeve is a tight fit. I know these are supposed to be the best, but I think I like the Sleeve City ones better, they are a bit beefier and don&rsquo;t crumple as much.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sleeves">Great Sleeves!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great! Ordered one package to check them out, will be ordering more!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cut-too-small">Cut Too Small</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second batch of Mo-Fi inner sleeves that seems to have been cut too small. Some records fit too tightly instead of sliding in easily like they have in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-and-the-best-around">Well made and the best around</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes these are just slightly to large for sleeves, especially gatefolds with 2+ Lps but other than that minor complaint these are very well made and keep my records safe</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-your-records">Great for your records!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does exactly what it says. Keeps your records protected. So much better than the paper sheets.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived quickly, well packaged. I love these album protectors. As soon as I get finished cleaning records and finishing this package, I will order another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fit-right-and-protect">Fit Right and Protect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second order. These sleeves fit and protect the record. I have seen some that do not fit right; too big or small.</p>
