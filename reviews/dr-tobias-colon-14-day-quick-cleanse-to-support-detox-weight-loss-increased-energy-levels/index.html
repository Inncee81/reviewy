14 Days That Make a Difference</p>

<p>Is your Colon at Work?</p>

<p>Your colon is meant to push undigested food - waste - out and allow the body to absorb healthy nutrients and minerals. </p>

<p>Processed foods and foods with little fiber are slow movers in the colon and tend to block the colon like a slow car in front of the fast cars - foods high in fiber are the fast cars. This way some &ldquo;buildup of waste&rdquo; can occur.</p>

<p>On average, a colon can contain 6-8 meals before pushing it out. Not eliminating waste but building it up is unhealthy and may cause occasional constipation, bloating, and feelings of being low in energy.</p>

<p>Regularity means you should eat one meal and evacuate one. What if you ate three meals each day and only evacuated two meals instead of three? After 1 week, your colon would still have the residue from 7 meals stuck in the intestinal tract.</p>

<p>Tested. Trusted. Dr. Tobias.</p>

<h5 id="my-holiday-cleansing-log-or-logs">My Holiday Cleansing Log&hellip; or logs&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently started my 14 day cleanse hoping to start the new year &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; and purge all the bad build up from the year/holiday. I have followed the directions and am consuming more water then it requires but I normally do. I will update my progress as time allows. I take it before bed (9:30 pm) so Day 1 its technically the next day. I started while I was off for the holidays so that I could get a handle on the experience before meshing it into my work life. I normally go once a day in the AM 5 days a week. I will update this as things progress.Here goes:Day 1 - No noticeable cramping. I actually missed my normal &lsquo;morning window&rsquo;. But about 10:30 am it was show time. Much larger than normal but solid. The smell was pretty bad. I guess it’s the loosening up stage. Went a total of 3 times the last being running with lots of pressure behind it.Day 2 - Still no cramping. The Gas has set in. I can clear a room. I went all morning without a movement, I was just &lsquo;venting&rsquo;. I took other people advice and make sure I did not fire anything off without being in the bathroom. Made it through the whole day with no bowel moments other than lots of gas.Day 3 - Woke up at 7 am with moderate cramping ready to go. I had a good deal or darker colored stool at first. The smell is like nothing I have ever had come out of me and I am an avid Mexican food consumer. I was in the bathroom for 20 mins (15 mins of action and 5 mins to finish angry birds). While I was washing my hands I had to go back in for another round. The stool was loose and lighter colored the second time. I went 6 times through out the day. There seemed to be mucus like &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; laced throughout the loose logs. Like the colons version of tinsel on a tree.Day 4 - I again hit the bathroom half awake at 7 am with mild cramps. I almost made the mistake of letting gas vent in bed. Wow am I glad I didn&rsquo;t. I no sooner hit the seat before my body let out what is best described as a chocolate shotgun blast. This prompted a shower after. I have noticed a good deal of oily film on the water. I hope the smell means that my body is getting rid of this stuff and not reacting to the formula. Day 4 is in the books with 5 movements. Most of which were urgent requiring a fast paced duck walk to the nearest bathroom. Frequent gas <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on the funk scale&hellip;Day 5 - Went right after my first cup of coffee. I was all some what solid and it was less urgent this time. Still producing a large volume of the &lsquo;tinsel turds&rsquo;. I have been drinking 6-8 bottles of water a day and have definitely noticed that I am thirsty all the time. I have also noticed that I am ravenously hungry. I am sticking to small healthy meals (chicken breast and fresh veggies). I made it through the day with only one movement. The Gas has definitely been the most extreme today that it has been. I am not sure how I am going to do this at work. I am basically a walking crop duster. <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on funk scale. I am also down 5 lbs from day 0.</p>

<p>Pretty sure in am now sterile on the inside. I have seen things come out of me that are indesribeable. Pretty sure a piece of bubble gum I swallowed in high school came out. I haven&rsquo;t eaten corn in 3 week either, apparently there were a lot of kernels trapped in there. It works,Maybe too well. Be close to a toilet and carry some wet wipes. God&rsquo;s speed.</p>

<p>You have to drink water along with this to get things moving. If I am hydrated, I go every day. If not and I take this , it doesn&rsquo;t move as fast. This works but remember to drink drink drink WATER</p>

<h5 id="a-gross-review-about-a-good-cleanse">A gross review about a good cleanse&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a 34 year old female in good health other than I occasionally get constipated. I try to do a cleanse a few times a year to prevent this, and it helps. Prior cleanses I did gave me tons of cramping and explosive diarrhea, so I decided to try this one.The Good:1-This stuff works like clockwork. I would take it between 8pm-11pm each night and every morning right around 9am it would kick in and I would have to use the bathroom.2-It starts working immediately. It worked the morning after I took the pills for the first time.3-No cramping at all!4-What comes out isn&rsquo;t diarrhea, so there&rsquo;s no nasty explosions.The Bad:1-When you feel the need to go to the bathroom, you better find one quick! You have about 2 minutes before you cr@p your pants!2-The first several days I woke up bloated and gassy. It eventually stops, but be prepared for that.The Gross:1-Your poop will smell insanely bad. I mean, poop normally doesn&rsquo;t smell great, but the smell of what is coming out of you is intense. The best way to describe it is this: Have you ever left vegetables too long in the fridge and they secrete that nasty brown juice in your veggie drawer? Yeah, it smells like that.2-Your poop will have the weirdest texture. Mine was really &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo; and floated. It almost looked like it was made of foam. It&rsquo;s hard to explain until you see it.Anyway&hellip;I completed the entire bottle over 14 days as a cleanse and my stomach feels much better. I did not lose any weight, but my stomach is definitely flatter and feels better. Be prepared to have to poop several times each day. I was going 3-4 times a day.</p>
