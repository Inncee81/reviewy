<blockquote>
<p>After putting 150 hours on the bulb I think I have a good idea how much I like this projector. Keep in mind that this projector is not in the same class as a $5,000-$20,000 projector so if you are comparing it to those you are in the wrong place. This is compared to the Optoma HD lines or the Epson Powerlites. I had an Epson projector before this (I have posted comparison pictures of the two) so I really wanted to get an Epson but then I realized how gigantic the powerlite line is and did not want something that big (I think they a little more than twice the size of this with the same picture quality.) I love the Epson brand and my friend bought the 8350 for his theatre and it looks amazing, after comparing it to this I could not see any distinguishable difference in picture quality so the size of the 1070 made me prefer it over the 8350. Next I thought about the Optoma HD20, its a little older but still a great projector. I bought one for my father in laws theatre room and it looks fantastic. He has it on a 100&rdquo; screen so it is a little hard to compare it to my system. I decided to go with the 1070 because of the lens shift; the HD20 took a lot of work and perfect placement to get it setup. Now to my set up.I have a 120&rdquo; electric Favi screen on my wall. I used the Peerless PRGUNV Precision Gear Universal Projector Mount - Black (best mount BTW don&rsquo;t get any other mount!) and it keeps it close to the ceiling, there is about 3 inches between the ceiling and the top of the projector. It is mounted at 13&rsquo; back, which was the farthest I could place it for my 120&rdquo; screen. With the mount I used and the lens shift it only took me about 15 minutes to get it perfectly calibrated, I even had someone comment on how perfect it looked on the edges while watching a football game last week. I have it hooked up to receiver with 5.1-surround sound. My room is fairly light controlled I have three windows with blinds on them. During the day it does let some light in but you can still watch anything on it just fine. I even turn off my lights and open one of the blinds sometimes to let a little light in while I&rsquo;m watching. As far as picture quality goes I am really impressed, but also it depends on the source being used. I have three things hooked up to it:1. Dish Network Joey - For the most part its good but broadcast only goes up to 720p (it lists as 1080i but resolution wise it is the same as 720p it just has better interlacing but that&rsquo;s a whole other article). 720p video stretched that big you get some artifacting sometimes. Our couches are 15&rsquo; away from the screen so you notice it the closer you get to the screen. Overall very watchable and very fun to watch games on, we love sports a lot at our house.2. Apple TV 3 - I use this to airplay content from Plex and I use the apps on the Apple TV. Airplay with Plex looks great, the apps that stream video on the ATV3 look much better than the Dish signal. I got rid of my ATV2 and am now using only Plex on my ATV3 and it works great.3. PS3 - This is where the projector really shines. I can use Plex (I&rsquo;m a huge Plex fan!) with DLNA on the PS3 and it looks stunning. Pop a blu ray in and it looks as good a picture as being at the movie theatre, people are impressed when they see the picture. I think some people have in mind that a projector is grainy and not very good quality compared to an LED or Plasma but projector technology has really advanced. Video games look great as well. I mostly play the Show 13, and COD four player split screen is really fun because its high quality and you each get your own TV basically when the 120&rsquo; screen is split up in four. I also have been using the PS3 to watch 3D movies since it is the only way I can play 3D .mkv rips.To end I will list my pros and cons. For the price this is a fantastic deal and an awesome addition to complete our theatre room in our basement.Pros:InexpensiveSmall/lightweightGood pictureLens shift (only up and down no sideways)Easy placementGood throw distanceNice menuHighly customizable calibration settings (I have a free calibration from Best Buy so they are going to come do a professional one for me)Excellent pictureEasy to program to universal remoteInputs switch much quicker than compared to the Epson 8350 or Optoma HD20Lots of inputs on the back if you don&rsquo;t use a receiver12v switch to connect an electric screen or other automated systems to it.Cons:The fan is a little loud; I put it on high altitude because I am at 4400 feet. I only notice it when a video is absolutely silent, if there is any noise in the video I can&rsquo;t hear the fan.Small light leakage. If I had this enclosed it might bother me more but so far I have never noticed it while watching any video and neither has anyone else. I only see it when I am looking at the projector trying to notice it.I turned off the high altitude mode because my basement is pretty cold, I ready that high altitude mode is to help keep it cooler. Since turning that off it is much quieter.Lens cap is tethered to the system. I will never take this down and have no need to put the lens cap on so I would like to be able to stick it in my remote drawer with all my remotes I never use.Long wait to turn back on. With all projectors I think one of the main downsides is that your room is very dark when watching a video. It can be hard to see the remote buttons if they don&rsquo;t light up. I have accidentally turned this off a couple times because I thought the power button was the volume button on my universal remote (hitting it twice turns it off). You have to wait about 5 minutes to turn it back on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The BenQ W1070 is an amazing little box. All of the features and performance are in this little box that projector enthusiasts have had to (and still do!) pay thousands of dollars in other projectors. To get the features and performance that this projector provides at this price point is a regular joe&rsquo;s dream. And the best part is that a nit picky videophile like myself will not feel like he has compromised performance for price. Folks are trading in their $3,000 plus projectors for the W1070 based on performance alone.To back-peddle a bit this was the situation I was in&hellip;. I have a big air duct/bulk head going right through the middle of my theater room which has given me problems of what projector I could use. I was forced to use a short throw 720p projector (GT750) that had 3D. It was great for what it was and it served me VERY well for about a year but it was only 720p + no zoom + no len shift +&hellip; you get the idea. Placement flexibility was VERY limited and 720p wasn&rsquo;t that bad but you could definitely notice especially when there was text on the screen. And there is text on my screen all the time with how much sports I watch.For quite some time I had hoped that a 1080p 3D projector would come out that fit my space needs. The W1070 was a godsend! Even if I didn&rsquo;t have the tight mounting space I would still get this projector.I ceiling mounted the projector with an Atdec ceiling mount found here on Amazon and fine tuned the picture position using the Test Pattern buried in the W1070&rsquo;s menu. For the novice mounter, you want to make sure that your measurements in relation to len and screen position are precise before you mount the projector. For the price, the Atdec ceiling mount did a great job allowing me to fine tune angles and picture position. The wiring was simple since when I finished my basement I ran the HDMI and power right over where I had planned to mount the W1070.For those of you with lens shift/offset questions. My setup includes the following. The top of my screen is 15&rdquo; from the ceiling. The center of the W1070 lens is about 8&rdquo; from the ceiling. I have the lens 8&rsquo;4&rdquo; away from a 100&rdquo; screen. I needed the top of the projected image to be 7&rdquo; below the center of the lens at 8&rsquo;4&rdquo; away. I set the lens shift all the way &ldquo;Up&rdquo; on the W1070 (which is &ldquo;Down&rdquo; if ceiling mounting&rdquo;) and that got me the EXACT offset I needed for the image to sit square. Very happy and relieved that my previous calcuations were correct and didn&rsquo;t have to resport to image distorting digital keystone and zoom. Keep in mind that this projector has an offset so the image will be projected UP if table mounted and DOWN if ceiling mounted. for a 100&rdquo; screen at 8&rsquo;4&rdquo; away the range of offset places the bottom/top of the image approximately 2.5&rdquo; - 7.5&rdquo; inches above/below the lens depending on how you mount it. This is crucial to know how it will affect your placement options.In classic Pro/Con fashion after about a month with the projector here are my impressesions.PROs-Colors are AMAZING on this projector. There is a reason it is ISF certified. The colors are fantastic out of the box but are even better when calibrated. I have mine setup on Cinema mode with Brilliant Color set to ON in EcoSmart mode and the Gamma set to 2.2. That is the best combination of brightness/color/ and contrast for my setup.-Sharpness and clarity are amazing. with 1080p Blu Ray content I was blown away with the clarity and depth of this projector. I also have a Darbee Darblet to help enhance depth and sharpness (highly recommended) but even without the Darblet the clarity and sharpness blew my old projector away.-Brightness is GREAT! This is a bonafide light cannon. With Brilliant Color and Smart Eco on with the Gamma set to 2.2 I can watch pretty much anything I want with pretty good contrast with the lights and lamps on in the room.-Black levels are above average. This projector will not get inky blacks like $10k projectors will but this holds its own. I was very impressed with the contrast and black levels on dark scenes and equally impressed with how much shadow detail was preserved in dark scenes. Huge improvement over previous projectors I have owned.-3D on this projector will blow you away. Not only is 2D content bright and clear but the 3D on this projector utilizes new 144hz technology to make it extremely smooth. With gamma controls to control brightness and contrast I found a 1.8 Gamma setting to be just right. I watched Avatar and Tron in 3D on this projector and was blown away by the strain-free viewing experience. I got the Sainsonic 144hz DLP-Link glasses for cheap on eBay and they work very well. Just make sure the L/R sync is correct otherwise it will cause eye-strain.I don&rsquo;t care for&hellip;-I wouldn&rsquo;t consider audible fan noise a con on this projector&hellip; its just not SUPER quiet like on larger beasts of projectors. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this on this projector so I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. In complete silence you can hear it&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never noticed it while watching content so that is what matters.-For the first week or so there is a faint smell from the fan that is basically from the bulb burning off manufacturing residue. Its not strong and not a bad smell. Just an electric metal type of smell. Its gone now and I expect this from any new projector.-Light leakage isn&rsquo;t great. This would be my only official gripe on the projector. With it being so small there are less chambers and places for the light to go in the projector. This results in a fair amount of light leaking from the fan exhaust. This is emitted to the right of the image when table mounting and to the left if ceiling mounting. The good news is that there is nothing leaking on the image but on a dark scene it is noticeable and I have placed a small piece of paper to block it. (See pics) There is also a halo of light on the ceiling from my ceiling mounted W1070 - this is from the lens assembly and I suppose you could resolve this by fixing a lens hood to the lens. I don&rsquo;t notice the halo when watching content and my ceiling is White White so it is more noticeable because of that. I&rsquo;m fine with the halo but the fan light leakage had to be taken care of.I really do love this projector and the small gripe with the light leakage I have with it was not enough to have me not give it <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> starts if I could&hellip; especially for the price.</p>
