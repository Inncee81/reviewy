<h5 id="i-like-the-jitterbug">I like the JItterbug.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better than I expected. Plan prices are affordable. Very easy to send texts and emails, download apps, manage phone. My interaction with Customer Service has been smooth. I hesitated getting a smart phone because of the monthly cost&hellip; didn&rsquo;t think I would use it that much.was mistaken&hellip; I use it a lot. I also didn&rsquo;t want to have to remember all those icons, like on my I pod. Don&rsquo;t have to with Jitterbug. Send a text, tap text. Send an email, tap email. Go on the internet, tap internet. I&rsquo;m 69 years old and like things simple. This was the phone for me.</p>

<h5 id="best-phone-ever-for-seniors-or-for-me">Best phone ever for seniors! Or for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this phone! I purchased this phone for my elderly mom who was in the hospital for 8 weeks. She had absolutely nothing to do but watch tv and talk on the phone. In 8 weeks she talked almost 5000 minutes! One of the great things about this phone is that when you are setting it up you have the option to set it up to regular smart phone mode or &ldquo;senior&rdquo; smart phone mode. The senior mode is larger. Very large. It has a lot of features that we have not used yet, such as health advice, etc. One of the things I really like is the brain games. It comes installed on the phone so you don&rsquo;t have to download anything. My mom has had several strokes and these games are really good for her to work her brain. The one she likes is simple matching colors and shapes. It starts off easy and gets a little harder. I also like that you don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;swipe&rdquo; to turn the phone on. My mom can NOT swipe! With this phone you turn it on by touching 3 circles. Circle 1, 2 and 3. They are big circles and easy for her to touch.To get minutes on this phone you just sign on to Great Call. It was easy to set up an account and sign her up for a monthly minute package. They offer several different ones and they were actually cheaper than what I am paying for straight talk. In fact, when she gets out of the hospital I am thinking about stealing her phone and making it mine!</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-phone">Really Nice Phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m having fun with this new phone from Great Call - after calling them up and swapping my number, information and plan settings it&rsquo;s all fun and games (no pun intended). If you buy one and are not an existing customer, activation should go easily and you&rsquo;ll get a new number. Just remember, ask how to turn off cellular data until you learn how the data part works or you&rsquo;ll built up one he*@# of a bill because their plans are for seniors and don&rsquo;t include a lot of data in any of their plans; you should be connected to Wi-Fi all the time or your data package will be eaten up.</p>

<h5 id="i-cut-the-comcast-hard-wired-cord-with-this-and-still-have-extension-phones-in-the-house-here-s-how">I CUT THE COMCAST HARD-WIRED CORD WITH THIS, AND STILL HAVE &ldquo;EXTENSION PHONES&rdquo; IN THE HOUSE! Here&rsquo;s how&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;boomer&rdquo; who was being gouged by Comcast for a $200/month &ldquo;Triple Pay.&rdquo; As I&rsquo;ve told them, their pricing games (like an overnight $30 jump in my monthly bill!) FORCE us to look for alternatives. I&rsquo;ll share what I found with you, as I LOVE to encourage people to punish Comcast for their crappy treatment of customers!I looked into VOIP phone systems like Ooma or Vonage but found too many serious complaints to feel safe, and not all would save me much money. Also, I wanted a phone for both home and on-the-go, not just for a replacement of my hard-wired system. After tons of research, I found the friendliest and lowest-priced alternative with the company GreatCall. They appear to be a senior-citizen health support company, apparently, not really a phone company. They just offer this phone that they&rsquo;ve sort of &ldquo;customized&rdquo; for easier use by aging folks. In most ways, they&rsquo;ve accomplished their goal, although people who are suffering hearing loss will be frustrated by the speaker output. I DON&rsquo;T have a hearing problem, but I wish it were louder. They use Verizon&rsquo;s cell network, so if your phone doesn&rsquo;t receive a good signal, well, nobody has 100% perfect coverage. I have read that Verizon is among the best. Ask other neighbors or relatives who already have cell phones about coverage in your area. I live in a major metro area; if you&rsquo;re out in the sticks, you can&rsquo;t expect the same strong signals we get here.Well, moving into a mobile phone for the first time made me nervous, and I didn&rsquo;t like giving up extension phones around our two-level house. What a drag to learn to carry a cell phone everywhere, all the time, even at home. But then I stumbled across the Panasonic Link-to-Cell Bluetooth system, modelKX-TGE274. This is a feature-rich wireless home system that allows me to have four (or even more) phones around the house! They are &ldquo;fed&rdquo; by the heart of my system, my Jitterbug phone. Using built-in Bluetooth, the Jitterbug catches the incoming calls, instantly transfers them to the Panasonic base unit, and I can then pick up ANY phone I&rsquo;m nearest to! Outgoing calls work the same way. Just pick-up a Panasonic extension and make the call as normal! Of course, you MUST keep the cell phone on to make or receive any calls.Perhaps this seems &ldquo;jerryrigged.&rdquo; Comcast tried to tell me how &ldquo;risky&rdquo; it was to give up a hard-wired phone. Really? The Jitterbug is battery powered, so if your home has a blackout, you still have a phone. If your battery runs low, you can charge it in your car. As for the Panasonic system, it is AC powered in the base and in each wireless handset base, BUT each handset can power the system with its rechargable batteries! You&rsquo;d have to go through FOUR sets of batteries before it would be useless. Consider this: If an intruder cuts your cable outside, and even disrupts your home&rsquo;s AC power, YOU&rsquo;RE STILL CONNECTED THIS WAY. Not so with &ldquo;safe, dependable&rdquo; Comcast! You&rsquo;ll still be able to grab your nightstand phone and call for help this way. With Comcast, you&rsquo;re dead in the water.Since the GreatCall plans start at $17.48, I&rsquo;m going to be saving about $80 a month! (My plan is about $25/mo.) The cost of both the Jitterbug (which I own outright, but only can be used with GreatCall&rsquo;s service) and the Panasonic system will be recouped in just a handful of months. No contracts to tie you down, very friendly, INTELLIGENT U.S. based customer support, a versatile home-and-away system&hellip;heck, is there any downside? Yes, unfortunately. Neither the cell phone nor the home system has the very bold volume levels of my old AT&amp;T phones. However, every unit of both new phones has a headphone jack&hellip;and I just bought a little slip-on audio amplifier/speaker that claims to increase volume by a factor of 30 times louder. This might prove useful in extremely noisy remote location on the cell, or with very low-level calls at home. If both companies can somehow crank up the gain, I would consider this the perfect phone combo that saves you a lot of money and proves the greatest versatility and freedom! Good luck!</p>

<h5 id="jitterbug-is-the-answer">Jitterbug is the answer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this phone for my technologically challenged husband. The screen is big, his chubby fingers can text without constant typos, and it is very simple to use. Before this he had a flip phone and then a Tracfone (smartphone). But the flip phone was ancient, and the Tracfone was small and never really worked properly. Most times that I tried to reach him, the phone had powered off and I went straight to voicemail&hellip;not helpful when trying to convey a change in plans or the need to run an errand before returning home. The Jitterbug is the answer to my dreams (and he likes it too, so he&rsquo;s more likely to use it.) Yeah!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Works great, I love it. Uses Verizon towers, sothe signal is awesome. Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-love-my-jitterbug">Absolutely Love my Jitterbug</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love my Jitterbug. It was very simple to figure out; especially your basic calling and texts. I previously used a flip phone and didn&rsquo;t feel I needed something terribly fancy and expensive although this does way more than I was expecting. I&rsquo;m still figuring out how much data I need for fun stuff, like e-mail, Facebook and the GPS. Every time I have spoken with anyone from GreatCall, I am so impressed. They have all spoken English so I can always understand them, they have been very, very friendly and helpful and you can change your minutes, texts or data plan each month if you want until you know what you need. I give GreatCall and this phone an A+. I am very happy with my choice!</p>
