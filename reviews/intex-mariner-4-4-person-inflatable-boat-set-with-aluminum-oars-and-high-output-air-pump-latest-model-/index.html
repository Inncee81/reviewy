<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a little boat take my wife and our two doggies on water adventures but I didn&rsquo;t want to tow a trailer and store a larger boat so decided on an inflatable raft for quick weekend trips. After reading about rubbery and easily over-inflatable rafts that busted easily, I decided on the Intex Mariner 4 due to reviews describing the material as tough and stiff compared to the others. I figured our pups claws could easily puncture the cheaper ones. Indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. It does feel quite rigid and strong. What I love is that It packs into a duffel bag. As others have mentioned, it&rsquo;s very heavy for a single bag so I split the load by putting the roll-up floor into another duffel. Do yourself a favor and get two sturdy duffel bags as others suggest as well.There was just enough room for my wife and I, plus our two dogs and minimal gear (Ice Chest, back pack, towels, etc). Overall, I&rsquo;m very happy with the purchase. We cut a piece of outdoor carpet to put on top of the roll-up floor just to give it a little more comfort and to keep the doggies claws from ripping up the vinyl. It also made it a little comfier to sit on the floor.Overall, I love it! I&rsquo;d recommend it to others looking for a tough little raft and I&rsquo;d buy it again. I agree with all the others that believe this one provides the best quality and value for the price.Minor complaints (not deal breakers but stuff to be aware of):Wish there was just a tad more room. I wanted slightly more room that the Excursion 5 gives you but the higher-quality and tougher Mariner 4 won out.The duffel bag is very thin and flimsy. For the weight that it has to support it should have been thick durable canvas instead of something that feels like paper. I feel it doesn&rsquo;t provide any protection so will upgrade that immediately.I would have preferred that the inflatable seats have the Boston Valves to make them easier to deflate. We didn&rsquo;t take them out the first time which made the raft feel a bit roomier so I probably won&rsquo;t use them much (if at all). I sat on the Ice Chest to get a better rowing angle.There&rsquo;s also no Boston Valve on the center keel so you have to pinch to deflate. I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo;, why not add those nifty Boston Valves everywhere - I would have paid extra.The Oars worked but I had to keep tightening them at the joints. The grip-ends completely slid off at one point so I&rsquo;ll be shopping around for replacements as I don&rsquo;t see them lasting long.It&rsquo;s made in China. Just sayin&rsquo;Additional Lessons and Updates:1) If you are hand-carrying to the water, splitting the load into two duffels is essential. This makes it easier to carry and put away.2) One of the paddles broke after only the second use. One of the plastic retainer rings broke off and flew into the water. I periodically checked to make sure the rings were securely tightened so it wasn&rsquo;t loose when it broke, it was nice and secure. That leads me to believe that it broke from stress though we were not rowing too hard. Shopping around for replacement options and calling Intex to see if they&rsquo;ll replace.3) Added a Minn Kota Endura C2 40 Freshwater Transom Mounted Trolling Motor (36&rdquo; Shaft) and a Intex Motor Mount Kit to the mix. This added another 26 pounds of weight to carry. Of course this requires a battery [EverStart Maxx Marine 24DC] to run it so add another 45 pounds for the battery. Lets not forget the That&rsquo;s a total of 71 additional pounds to carry to the water which brings me to the next lesson.4) Added a Farm &amp; Ranch FR110-2 Steel Utility Cart with Removable Folding Sides and 10-Inch Pneumatic Tires, 400-Pound Capacity, 34-Inches by 18-Inches, Green Finish because of the now good-workout 4 round trips from vehicle to water (a) Bag one with raft and small gear (b) Bag 2 with floor, paddles and other gear &copy; Trolling Motor and Ice Chest and (d) The 45lb Marine Battery. That reduced to one trip with the Utility Cart.5) Added a Minn Kota Trolling Motor Power Center which only added one more pound. It&rsquo;s a really nice enclosure for the battery that powers the trolling motor and it has a built-in power meter and accessory plugs.6) The cost of additional accessories can quickly add up. So far totally worth it.7) Any boat with a motor or sail operated in Colorado on any public waters must be registered with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. So I have to paid about $35 for the registration and have to do that every year now. I get a sticker to put on the raft plus I have to put the registration number on. I initially did this with vinyl stickers but they don&rsquo;t stay on very well so I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll just use permanent marker when the stickers wear off for next year.**** 1 Year Update <strong><em>September 15th, 2014It&rsquo;s been a year and we&rsquo;ve used the raft many times. I&rsquo;m very satisfied with this purchase and would buy it again if I needed to replace it. No problems or any holes yet so I&rsquo;ve not needed to use the repair kit. I was thinking of rigging a canopy for sun protection but we just take large umbrellas and that has worked out great. We&rsquo;ve never used the inflatable seats that came with it, I just sit on a cooler which works great and is functional storage. The family including the dogs love the raft and adventures it enables. B-)</em></strong> *** *** *** *** *** ***</p>

<h5 id="update-after-2-years">Update after 2 years&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a birthday present for my 13 year old son. We have been wanting one for years but don&rsquo;t have the garage space and our homeowners association won&rsquo;t allow us to park it outside. Have had it on the water a half dozen times or so now and it&rsquo;s holding up great. Set up is quick and easy and the included high output manual air pump works great. Don&rsquo;t waste your $$$ on a motorized one&hellip;it really won&rsquo;t save you any time at all. By the 3rd time or so we took it out we could have it unpacked, inflated, and ready to put in the water in around 12 minutes! I would not recommend more than 3 people. It&rsquo;s cozy with 3 and fishing with 3 is very difficult. I did purchase the motor mount and a trolling motor which in my opinion are a must. I can&rsquo;t imagine spending any considerable amount of time on the water using just the included paddles. Also, I wish there were some sort of integrated cupholders. I&rsquo;m not knocking my review for that because I knew what I was getting but am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 because it is virtually impossible to repack into the carrying bag it comes in and because if you advertise as a raft for 4, it should fit 4.*** Take care of this raft and it will take care of you! We have now had this raft for 2 years and are into our 3rd boating season with it. We take care to wash and thoroughly dry it after each use as well as store it properly. When we take it to the lake we bring a tarp to place it on while inflating to reduce the chance of punctures from rocks or sticks.All that being said, in the water we have certainly put this raft to the test. It has been drug over rocks, had dogs inside of it, floated across sunken downed tree branches, and it has never had a leak and looks like brand new. I am updating my review from 4 stars to 5. The complaints I had that caused me to take away a star previously are still valid. I just feel like after 2 years this raft has been such a great value that it has earned it&rsquo;s 5th star back!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this boat as an upgrade from my Intex Seahwak II. The boat handles a whole lot better than the Seahawk II due to the inflatable keel. I wish Intex would make a snap together floor for it. The roll out semi rigid floor is still really wobbly and you will not be satisfied with the flooring. I know I can MAKE a wooden floor; which I will, but I&rsquo;d rather buy it already with a floor even if it costs me a bit extra.Other than that this little boat is great. I have a mount kit, Minn Kota power center, 30 lb thrust Minn Kota,swivel seats and it all works really awesome especially since it all fits in my sedan. I fish at Braunig and Calaveras lake in San Antonio regularly and get some strange looks from boaters&hellip;but more from kayak people. I only go out in winds less than 15mph for my own personal comfort zone. I have added pics of our Seahwk II and our new Mariner 4.One last note to mention is that I&rsquo;m 230 lbs and I usually take out my son whom weighs 130lbs and the pontoons stay at least 14 inches above the water even with all our gear.</p>

<h5 id="tough-little-boat">Tough little boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this as an option that didn&rsquo;t require a trailer to move around. It does great once you get it in the water. It is rather cumbersome to set up if you&rsquo;re taking it to an area where you can&rsquo;t park near the water. I put it to the torture test. I ran it into trees, pulled it over fallen logs, and just generally beat the crap out of it. It took it all. The flooring does make it sturdy enough to stand in, but it&rsquo;s still not as stable as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; boat. I think it would be a much more usable option if I could come up with a collapsible dolly to move it from the truck to the water. Unfortunately, the only ones I&rsquo;ve found are made for very narrow boats like kayaks and canoes.As a side note, contrary to the way the description and picture make it sound, this does not come with a motor mount. You have to buy that separately. I threw a 55 pound thrust trolling motor on it, and it does fine though.</p>
