<p>Color:INCC1205
The Instapark INCC1205 solar charge controller is designed and engineered to prevent your 12V battery from overcharging when it&rsquo;s connected to a solar panel, therefore protect your investment and extend the battery life. The INCC1205 solar charge controllers is equipped with PWM technology to ensure that your battery reaches its maximum charging capacity without causing any damage to the battery. Similar to other modern high quality battery chargers, PWM algorithm gradually reduces the charging current to avoid over-heating of the battery, yet the charging continues to return the maximum amount of energy to the battery in the shortest time resulting in higher charging efficiency, faster recharging and a healthier battery at its full capacity.</p>

<p>Each INCC1205 charge controller comes with four green LED indicators and one red LED indicator displaying battery status, connection status and real-time battery charge capacity. The INCC1205 solar charge controller is in full conformance with both CE and RoHS standards and is backed up by a standard 2-year manufacturer’s warranty.</p>

<p>Specifications:</p>

<p>Rated solar input current: 5A
Rated output charging current: 5A
Charging voltage: 12.8V
Cut-off voltage: 14.6V
Float voltage: 13.8V Temp Comp. (mV/°C): -30mV/-60mV

<h5 id="it-was-very-easy-to-adapt-this-charge-controller-to-each-solar-chargers">It was very easy to adapt this charge controller to each solar chargers &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have Two separate solar chargers . Instapark mercury 27 and a Goal zero nomad 20 . It was very easy to adapt this charge controller to each solar chargers specific 12 volt system . They both work well and are very compact . So they very easily fit into each solar chargers storage pocket . I would recommnend this charge controllerREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far, so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to replace an older controlled that came with a 10W panel. The older controller was bare wire screw in and I wanted the simple plug aspect of this one. So far it has worked great and done its thing with a variety of panels and batteries. I am not trying to do anything funky like use multiple panels, or charge multiple batteries or power devices, just using it in the simple application it was designed for. It&rsquo;s small and cheap, and its main job is maintenance charging of a travel trailer battery. It lives in the battery box, and quick connects to the panel and battery. I spent the $3 for the battery tender SAE plug ring connector cord for the battery, so it&rsquo;s impossible to screw up plugging it in.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-and-works-exactly-as-advertised">Easy to use and works exactly as advertised.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the fifth or sixth Instapark product I have purchased, and the third low-amp solar controller. My application is charging sealed lead acid batteries with portable solar panels and the first two controllers have survived outside for a couple years, which is far better than I&rsquo;d have expected given their price point. I am pretty impressed by the durability and quality of them, and this latest one seems even better than the first two since it&rsquo;s <em>designed</em> to go outside. ;) The input of this particular controller is a standard DC jack, which mates directly with most and maybe all of Instapark&rsquo;s solar panels, so that works easily. The output is a standard &ldquo;trailer connector&rdquo; which makes it pretty painless to use if you don&rsquo;t want to use the included battery clamps. I picked up a matching trailer connector from a local auto parts store along with some .187 quick disconnects and voila, an Instapark panel connected to an Instapark controller connected directly and easily to F1 terminals on the aforementioned SLA batteries. An easy, cheap solution that works as advertised.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="not-waterproof">NOT waterproof !!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason I bought this was so I could use it outside to charge a generator battery with a small solar panel. It stopped working after the first rain. This was in spite the fact that I used silicone to seal the clearly not waterproof-looking side seams.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-s-been-working-fine-for-the-couple-of-weeks-that-i-ve-had-it">It&rsquo;s been working fine for the couple of weeks that I&rsquo;ve had it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product to keep an external 12v Battery on a Game Camera charged from a small solar panel. It&rsquo;s been working fine for the couple of weeks that I&rsquo;ve had it installed. It is a simple installation. The indicator lights on the front are simple and straightforward.I did capture lots of pictures of the elk that have been sneaking into my front yard recently to feed in the middle of the night. Being an &ldquo;engineer type&rdquo;, I like and appreciate &ldquo;KISS&rdquo; (Keep It Simple Stupid!) products.I will probably buy the product again for other &ldquo;remote power projects&rdquo; that I have around the place.I did purchase another competing product to compare them, but I like the Instapark product much better. Simple and no &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo;!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-does-exactly-what-it-is-supposed-to">Great does exactly what it is supposed to!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I never read the dimensions of this controller, and its pretty compact! Thats a big plus. The water proof part is nice too. Instead of hiding your controller in a water tight area you can have it out in the open. Well besides the open connectors, easily fixed with terminal heat shrinks. The only think it lacks, I believe, is that there is know battery life meter. This would be five star if it came with heat shrinks, for true water proofing, and a power gauge for battery capacity. Great product totally worth the money if you need 5 amps or less!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="excellent-customer-service-18-month-warranty">Excellent customer service, 18 month warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to compliment the excellent customer service at Instapark. When the storage battery it was connected to unaccountably discharged, I sent an email to Instapark with the situation and requesting guidance. I received a reply from a technician almost immediately and, after following his troubleshooting instructions and providing some additional data, I received a replacement unit in the mail. Please note that the warranty, as stated in the the instruction manual for the INCC1205, is 18 months, not 12 months as stated on the warranty card.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="one-out-of-3-doa">One out of 3 DOA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I installed this unit a year after purchase (it was a spare). It never worked correctly. I purchased a new one which did work as described. I contacted Instapark who said they would replace it, but then heard nothing else from them after I provided Amazon purchase information. One out of two working might be worth 3 stars, but not getting a timely reply from Instapark cost 1 star. I have now ordered unit #3 so I will have a spare. I will update with results after it is installed. I have a second identical installation which has the same obsolete 3A Instapark controller that failed requiring use of my spare. I will replace that controller when the new one comes.Update:10/31/2015 - The new controller was installed and is DOA. It shows it is charging (LEDs), but there is nothing going to the battery. I left this installed 2 days, and the battery was dead (10 volts). It also would not charge a new battery. Instapark needs to get QC working!!!Update 11/12/2015 - I have changed the rating to 3 stars. After a third failed unit, I discovered that two failures were my fault. The open voltage of one of my two panel installations was &gt;30 volts which is too high for these charge controllers. Both of these &ldquo;failed&rdquo; showing that they were charging, but no charge was going to the battery. I opened one, and found that both of the small NPN transistors (Y1) had failed. They were replaced and the unit worked. So the only real failure was the first one, and it failed because the microprocessor would not start reliably. I replaced the solar panel on the second installation, and both installations now work (so far).READ MORE</p>
