<h5 id="lightweight-yet-sturdy-wall-mount-perfect-for-my-rv">Lightweight yet sturdy wall mount. Perfect for my RV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was just what I needed for my RV TV install. This came with the hardware necessary to drive this into the wall stud of my RV and is holding up my 19&rdquo; TV with no issues at all. The small wire management clips beneath the bottom bar don&rsquo;t hold in place quite as well as I had hoped but that is mainly because I am running a coax cable in addition to the regular power cable. I plan to put a couple of cable wraps Case Logic CT-6 Self Attaching Cable Ties (Assorted Colors) to hold the cables tightly in place. The square steel tubing arms provide substantial strength and I even plan to drill a slot through the top bar and outer arm bar so I can drop a retaining pin in place in order to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; the TV in place when traveling. There is nothing about adding these holes that would concern me as far as loss of strength due to the already light but strong construction of the square tubing. With an older, heavier TV that is closer to the weight limit of this arm, your mileage may vary. Finally, although it did not mention in the instructions to do so, I decided to drill a tiny <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; pilot hole before driving the provided lag bolts into the trailer&rsquo;s outer stud due to the smaller size vs. an ordinary residential stud. I thought this would help prevent splitting or cracking and had no issues. I also checked to make sure the lag bolts were not too long that they would not poke out the outside of the RV. You will want to check this if you plan the same and add extra washers to the bolt to shorten the amount of bolt that goes into the wall. The kit also includes concrete lag shields but I had no use for them in my application. The only extra thing that might be useful if you&rsquo;re installing this yourself would be to get a magnetic torpedo level Stanley 43-511 Magnetic Shock Resistant Torpedo Level. This is especially useful if you&rsquo;re installing this in an RV like me since you can toss the magnetic level in your RV&rsquo;s tool box to give you another level to make sure your rig is level when you get to your campsite. Just be sure your RV or camper is already level before expecting a good reading from this wall mount. The bottom bolt hole is flared wider than the top to allow you to adjust the level and tighten it in place once located. We&rsquo;ve used this mount a couple of times already and are expecting it to outlast the TV we installed on it. I definitely recommend this product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the Suptek Articulating Arm TV LCD Monitor wall Mount.Packaging was simple and the box it arrived in was small, both of which are things I like. The installation instructions were straight-forward. Mounting the monitor arm to the wall went great. The arm/hinges are stiff, yet movable. I had some issues with mounting the VESA adapter to the monitor. The provide screws were about half a cm too long and there were no spaces or enough washers to make the screws snug to the adapter. This could be due to the monitor being a cheaper korean panel (qnix 27, 1440p). No star deductions for that as including all the different screws and dozens of washers wouldn&rsquo;t help most people with compatibility. I should have checked the monitor before installing.Attaching the VESA adapter to the monitor was easy, however, the vertically mounted monitor refused to stay put. It will lean to one side at about a 10 degree angle. I tightened the bolt on the VESA adapter, but it had no impact. This could be due to the monitor being unequally weighted and i feel that a horizontally mounted monitor wouldn&rsquo;t have this issue, regardless, i&rsquo;m taking a star off as i had to rig up some zip ties to hold it vertical. I also saw no mention or mechanism to change the tilt as the product mentions 20 degrees of tilt. I couldn&rsquo;t find out how. one star for that.Overall, you get what you pay for. This is an incredible price for a monitor mount, however, it does have some issues to overcome.</p>

<h5 id="easy-installation-and-great-price">Easy installation and great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install but the instructions could use more detail. Even with the caucus pictures and extra parts leftover, this product was installed within 30 mins and articulates perfectly. Fits our 22&rdquo; monitor screen and we were able to mount it near our kitchen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-an-excellent-mount-for-the-price">This is an EXCELLENT mount for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This unit does not have an actual TILT forward/backward function. It will allow you to extend out, rotate your screen in a circular motion, pan left and right, but you cannot tilt your screen up and down. The main reason this is an issue for me: I installed this on the wall, next to our bed, at the foot of our bed, probably 6ft in the air. I have used all the wiggle room the bottom part of the mount will provide, and I have even loosened the top two screws on the plate to allow the TV to fall forward a little more, but we still have to view the 22in TV from &ldquo;underneath&rdquo;. On our screen, this takes a little bit of the brightness from our view.This is an EXCELLENT mount for the price, but if you&rsquo;re going to have ALL that mobility EXCEPT for allowing the user to tilt, I have to ask why? I do recommend this product to those who are okay with an eye level mount. If you&rsquo;re needing something going UP on the wall, just keep in mind that this does not tilt forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really good bracket. It tilts and swivels. The hardware that comes with it is really durable. It has everything you need to do the install. A few things, though. If you plan to rotate the monitor, be sure to measure the diagonal distance from the center to one of the corners of your monitor and add <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; for sag. Likewise, if you plan on upgrading the monitor to a larger size, you will have to reposition the bracket on the wall. It cannot move up and down, which would have been a nice feature. Make sure the cross plate fits flush on your monitor; I had to bench grind down some material near the screw holes to fit my 5+ year old off-brand monitor to make it fit perfectly, but this is surely not going to be an issue for modern monitors. Last, you should pre-play with, then tighten the center bolt <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> turn prior to installation, to make sure it&rsquo;s plenty stiff to resist &ldquo;gravity assisted auto rotation,&rdquo; my words for it. I got it all on, then the monitor spun like a pinwheel in the wind, so I had to take it all off, tighten, then put it all back on.Anyway, I wish I had mounted my monitor years ago with this. It&rsquo;s really sturdy, and now my workplace is da bomb.</p>
