<h5 id="very-quiet-cube-rings-are-a-bonus">Very quiet cube! Rings are a bonus!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> We have quite a few fidget spinners which have been lifesavers. The ADHD in my family (including myself) has been longing for an outlet. My kids have been asking for a cube, which I wasn&rsquo;t sure about because I didn&rsquo;t want to get something that was noisy (the spinners are great for church) and I have seen some that weren&rsquo;t quiet.I decided to give this one a shot because it also included the rings, which I hadn&rsquo;t seen before. It got here and the kids instantly started arguing about who got to try it first. Needless to say it was a hit, and it really was quiet. I flipped it around and played with it for a while. Then I tried the rings. I really like these because I can hide the rings in my pocket and fiddle with them and they aren&rsquo;t noisy, like keys would be. I am really happy with both of these!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fidget-cube-for-hours-of-relief-of-anxiety">Fidget cube for hours of relief of anxiety</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cube is the quietest cube I have had yet. When using a fidget device it is good when no one else is even aware you are using it because they cannot hear it. Each area moves smoothly and effortlessly. It even came with a bonus key ring apparatus that is equally as fun. My son who has anxiety has found this very usefully already. The product is super lightweight and easy to hold in your hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="both-are-very-well-made-the-ring-toy-is-better-than-i-expected">Both are very well made. The ring toy is better than I expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cube and ring fidget toy! The cube is the reason I bought this set but the I cant put the ring toy down! It fits perfect in my hand and is quieter than the cube at times. The cube is sturdy and the color is really nice. All of the sides work as advertised and it is great for keeping my hands busy. The ring toy is very simple but works perfect as a fidget toy. It also fits more comfortably in my pocket vs the cube. Overall both are great quality compared to the others I have and I would recommend this set to a friend who is looking for their first fidget toy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adding-to-the-collection">Adding to the collection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are, by far, the best fidget cubes for me and my family. The problem is that I tend to forget them places so I have decided to buy a bunch so that I can have some devoted to the house and some devoted to the cars. Everyone on my family uses them so we need a bunch of them to make sure everyone has access to them.I seem to be the only one that truly likes the extra flip toy that comes with it though. Maybe because there are times where I don&rsquo;t need full fidget functionality, but do need a little something based on the situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-kids-and-adults">Great for kids and adults.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the fidget cubes, so much to do with them. Each side of it has a different activity. Most of it is silent, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting on someone&rsquo;s nerves while you play with it. I know there are a lot of people that have a habit of clicking their pen or playing with the switches on car doors. This cube has the same effect for both of those things. It is literally a fidgeters dream come true!The flippy chain is just as much fun. You just rotate it back and forth. Both of the fidgeters only need one hand to play with them, so easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cube">Great cube</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fidget cube is great. My boys love them and took all my others so I bought a pink one and hope they will leave it alone :) I like this one because the buttons click very well and the switch is my favorite.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-2pack">Nice 2pack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this specifically for the metal flipper. I hadn&rsquo;t tried one and thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot since I love my other fidgets. It arrived nicely packed in a gift box. Both pieces function well. The cube fidget offers multiple tactile functions. The metal flipper is pretty awesome like I hoped it would be. Very cool!</p>
