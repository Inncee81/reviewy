<h5 id="they-ultimate-gopro-battery-for-now">They Ultimate GoPro Battery For Now!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In this video I explain why for now (September, 2014) I consider the Wasabi Power Extended Battery Pack, the ultimate battery for GoPro cameras. I have completed a good bit of testing and gotten some impressive results with battery life times in various shooting modes. Watch and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. Great job Wasabi!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-battery">Great battery!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing adds some considerable juice to the go pro! The back stays on well, and it isn&rsquo;t too heavy to be used with a stick mount. It withstood being splashed with saltwater continuously, and the charger charged the original battery, and extended battery fine.We used this while filming in Kauai and never ran out of battery power. Would for sure recommend to purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-battery-for-long-events">Great battery for long events.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this with my Hero 3+ silver recording at 1080p 60FPS and I get over 3 hours of recording. I record my daughter&rsquo;s softball games and on tournament weekends I am often recording a 1-1.5 hour game, stop recording run to the adjacent field and start recording the next game. With the standard batteries I can handle a 1:15 game but if that game runs over (overtime) I can possibly lose the end of the game. With this battery pack I know I can go at least 2 1:30+ games without worrying. This past weekend we were playing 1:30 games and we had 3 games in a row go to tie breakers (two of them added 30 minutes to each game); after the first two games (a total of about 3:15 of recording time) the GP showed the battery level as one bar so I hooked up my usb power pack to the camera for 30 minutes between the 2nd and 3rd games (at which time I also switched out memory cards) which brought the level back to 2 bars; those two bars easily made it through the 3rd game (which lasted ~1:45) and still had power left. I have not yet pushed this battery to its shut down point so I&rsquo;m not sure how long it will go before shutting but I know it will get me through a 64 GB worth of 1080 60fps recordings.I own a number of other Wasabi batteries and chargers for other camera and none of them have yet to let me down.</p>

<h5 id="rubber-silicone-sealing-issues-beware">Rubber/silicone sealing issues! beware!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the rubber/silicone ring seal from the included backdoor for hero 3+ protrudes outside the corner when door is closed. I haven&rsquo;t gone scuba diving yet but this will present a problem. the rubber seal for the hero 3 backdoor also presents a problem, it seems like there is not enough rubber for sealing. I will not trust these waterproof backdoors for deep dive or even snorkeling. I have the hero 3 and hero 3+</p>

<h5 id="unbelievable-battery-life">Unbelievable battery life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unbelievable battery life. I know they advertise 5 hours at 1080 30 fps, HOWEVER, with a full charge, my Gopro-3 w/ Wasabi battery showed a 17 hour battery rating via the connect app. I first thought, OK, let&rsquo;s cycle through the battery a few times to see if the number adjusts. After using the Gopro while driving from LA to San Diego, then back to LA, 7 hours in total, I still showed 50% when returning home. I recharged the battery and again, my connect app showed a 17 hour battery life. I thought this cannot be correct&hellip;..Still uneasy that the stats were incorrect, I went ahead and used the Gopro w/ Wasabi battery for it&rsquo;s intended use-Cycling. I did an 80 mile bike ride in 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours. I looped my video in 15 minute increments with a 256-GB microSD card. I rode from South LA to Temecula and once I arrived, my Gopro still showed 50% battery. Like I said-Unbelievable battery life.I&rsquo;ve purchased 3 GoPro batteries and an extended battery pack over the past couple of years. The longest battery life with the extended battery pack was about 2 hours if I was lucky. I got to the point of not using my GoPro because of the crappy batteries.Wasabi battery is a must have for any GoPro.Hit me up if anyone is looking to purchase used GoPro batteries and an extended battery pack-Just Kidding Amazon-No I&rsquo;m not&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="innovative-design-cheap-price-power-for-days">Innovative Design, Cheap Price, &amp; Power For Days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as aftermarket battery brands go, Wasabi is pretty much the best out there, so when I saw that they finally released a battery bacpac for the GoPro, I knew it would be a good product. Now after using it for almost a month, my opinion on it has changed from good to great. As far as design goes, I really like that they took the time to come up with a new take on the battery bacpac rather than just copying the GoPro one. The extra battery life is also a plus, especially when taking extended timelapses or when in a wet environment where you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be taking your GoPro out of its case to change batteries.Now it does have some flaws, but those are mostly cosmetic and my personal preference rather than issues with the performance of the battery itself. The Wasabi Power bacpac does not have an indicator to show battery level, something which I found myself missing after using the GoPro Battery BacPac (which includes a little LCD display which shows how many bars of charge are remaining). Aesthetically I also found Wasabi BacPac to be brick-ish and somewhat boring when compared to the GoPro version. However, this affects the performance in no way and really isn&rsquo;t a big deal considering that this one is $10 cheaper than GoPro&rsquo;s, AND you get a dual battery charger (which works with standard GoPro batteries).I would definitely recommend this to anyone out there who is looking for the longest lasting GoPro battery on the market. If you need a battery to last you for over 3 hours and don&rsquo;t mind increasing the overall size of the GoPro and housing (because of the addition of the BacPac), then definitely get this product.PROS:-Longer battery life than GoPro&rsquo;s Battery BacPac.-Innovative design. Instead of having to charge a GoPro Battery and Battery BacPac separately you charge and use them as one.-Inexpensive, especially when consider that you also get a dual charger (which can charge GoPro batteries), a mini USB cable, and an two extended backs for the GoPro housing (one skeleton and one standard).CONS:-Visually boring and brick shaped.-No small &ldquo;E-Ink&rdquo; style LCD screen on the back to display the charge level.-When installed, the GoPro doesn&rsquo;t fit in the old GoPro extended frame mount (it should fit the new one though.</p>
