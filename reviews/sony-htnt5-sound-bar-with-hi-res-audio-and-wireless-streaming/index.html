<h5 id="highly-recommended-beautiful-sound-with-a-sleek-design">Highly recommended! Beautiful sound with a sleek design!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was tough to decide whether or not to give this sound bar a 4 or 5 star review, but the more I use it, the more I love it. The amount of features packed into this thing is simply astounding! I will list all of the things I love about this sound bar, it is honestly hard to find a negative thing to say about it so if I find one, I will post it.1) It has a low enough clearance to sit below the sensor on my Sony Bravia 55&rdquo; so that I can sit on my couch and still easily use the TV apps.2) It is just attractive looking, it compliments the TV so well and almost disappears into my black tv stand so it almost seems as if the sound is still coming out of the tv but with a much higher quality.3) The clarity of the bar is amazing, busy scenes still manage to give distinct sounds; both voice and music don&rsquo;t get jumbled in high action sequences and Blu-Ray movies have a slight surround to them even with no rear speakers. I will be adding the Satellite speakers in the near future to complete/boost the surround effect.4) Night-Mode is a life saver for apartment dwellers, the bass on this thing is very present so even at 6-8 it could still disturb your neighbors . Night-mode muffles the sound without having to adjust the bass level but still leaves enough to give a little rumble.5) Just about everything has Bluetooth connection, but I was impressed at how stable the connection was even from the other end of my apartment in the closet.6) HDMI ARC is the best new tv tech that no one knows about, since this thing has 3 regular HDMI ports I can connect my devices straight into the soundbar and use it as a receiver to get the higher Dolby sound without sacrificing image quality! This is one of the most underrated features on new TVs and soundbars. If you have a TV and soundbar with HDMI ARC and you aren&rsquo;t using it, you are sorely missing out!7) Setup with the HDMI ARC was as easy as plugging it to the TV, 3 minutes of the easy-setup guide and I was good to go.I originally purchased a Klipsche R20-B set for a much lower price that had a great sound but no features (the sub could only be adjusted manually) and blocked my TV sensor. Was scared that Sony wasn&rsquo;t going to have the sound quality of the Klipsche, but the complete opposite happened. The Sony has a much crisper and fuller sound in the bar and the subwoofer is a lot tighter with the fast bass lines. The only thing the Klipsche did better was having a massive 10&rdquo; speaker in the subwoofer that got very, very loud. If you are looking for a quality soundbar under $1000, this is the best you can find!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably not the best option if you are serious about home theater sound. But this can&rsquo;t be beat for ease of setup. Good volume, handles movie soundtracks well, but not a great choice for music. Looks great with my wall mounted 55&rdquo; Sony too.</p>

<h5 id="love-mine-but-a-few-small-issues">Love mine, but a few small issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love mine!I have two small issues with it, one that it goes back to the USB input once you leave the TV/ARC mode. And you can&rsquo;t change the default input to something like HDMI1 or TV.The second small issue is that the OSD does not show when playing 4k content, it only displays on 1080p content. I think this can probably be fixed easily with a firmware update.</p>

<h5 id="great-soundbar-for-midroom-size-tv-viewing-hires-music-playback-a-plus">Great Soundbar for MidRoom size TV viewing, HiRes Music Playback a Plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Oct 2016 update to review below: The issue I experienced below (having to do a system reset after listening to Hi Res music off the USB drive) appeared to be related to the Sony USB drive Itself! From experience NEVER pull the USB drive out of the HTNT5 while the unit is on even if not playing music at the time! Even tho the USB music played fine after that, something made the subwoofer stop playing until a system reset was done. I reformatted the 64GB USB drive at the lowest level, copied music back onto it and all seems well now. I do not use the surround sound feature.Other observations&hellip;I have had the HTNT5 for at least 4 months now, and had it sitting in front of the TV which makes the speakers somewhat face upwards. I felt I could not hear the voices enough (even with the voice add #2 on), so&hellip;I put the wall mount brackets on the soundbar, and then put it back in front of the TV which now makes it sit upright a lot more now (if your TV screen is high enough, else raise your TV up to be above the speaker). Voices seem a bit better for those of us with a little older or rock and rolled out ears!And finally, re my Sony customer service observations below, 5 months and a dozen calls later, Sony Finally sent a check buying back my previous HTNT3 soundbar&hellip;.so be aware of the glacial pace of this process should you ever need service for your Sony product and your need to continually push the process.Original review:I have all Sony Equipment in my home&hellip;.2 HD TVs, 2 New BluRays, 2 Wireless bluetooth Speakers, 2 Soundbars, HEARON headphones, and have extensively used and spent money on Sony Equipment over the past 8 years.My prior Sony HTNT3 Soundbar froze up during a firmware upgrade&hellip;&hellip;called for warranty service&hellip;&hellip;20 excruciating hours later after dealing with Sony&rsquo;s &lsquo;repair&rsquo; service United Audio, I am still waiting for my HTNT3 &lsquo;buyback&rsquo; check from Sony (the buyback amount is fair tho, I will give them that if I do receive the check). BUT&hellip;&hellip;since I was &lsquo;all Sony&rsquo;, in the meantime I went out and purchased the Sony HTNT5 soundbar on sale so I could use all the integrated features. I have had the HTNT5 for a few months at this point.Initially this soundbar sounded great and still does when it is fully working. Adjustments and features are high end and the build is quality. Bass does not seem as tight as the HTNT3 was. Interface to the features and music is much superior to the HTNT3. SongPal allows control from your phone if desired else the unit itself will connect to your home network to play DLNA server music (Hi Res music is only playable on an attached USB drive however). Unit has multiple amplifiers attached to each speaker (4 tweeters and 2 midrange in the bar itself). HiRes DSD 2.8mhz files such as &lsquo;Thriller&rsquo; sound incredible (note that the unit does not play DSD 5.6mhz but does play FLAC files)But&hellip;.it seems that since the latest firmware upgrade from Sony (which added the &lsquo;wireless surround&rsquo; feature that few will actually use), the unit has been acting finicky.The issue is now, every single time I listen to music through the USB drive (which is also a Sony 64GB USB), and then turn the input to another device like HDMI 1 for my TV, the wireless Subwoofer quits working! I have tried selective system resets to no avail. I have reset the cables and the USB (all the things Sony had me do when I called about the prior soundbar&rsquo;s issues). The only thing that brings the subwoofer back is doing a complete factory reset!I recently also bought the new Sony HEARON wireless headphones, hoping to take advantage of the Hi Res music capabilities of the unit and LDAC wireless features. The sound is great with or without the headphones, but again, the minute you listen to music, headphones or not, the subwoofer quits working, and back to the factory reset menu!I am hoping that someone from Sony reads these reviews as this is quite frustrating, and calling Sony support only adds to the frustration.So in the end, if you are just looking for a quality soundbar for your TV this is a great unit and can fill a room with sound quite easily, this is the unit for you. If you want to use other features such as Hi Res music, bluetooth headphones, screen mirroring, etc&hellip;..then use this review as caveat emptor for your research as results may vary until Sony works out the kinks with this unit. The HTNT3 was available for less than 2 years, this may be the case with the HTNT5.Finally, in the interest of complete disclosure, it is interesting to me that all the &lsquo;Vine Free Equipment&rsquo; reviews of this product are glowing reviews, and the only reviewers reporting issues with this unit are people who actually paid for it. I tend to skip Vine reviews as I have a hard time believing that someone who receives something for free can really review it with a critical eye. After all, caveat emptor means Let the BUYER beware.</p>
