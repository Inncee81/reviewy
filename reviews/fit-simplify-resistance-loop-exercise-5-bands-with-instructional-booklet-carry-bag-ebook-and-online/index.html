<p>#1 Best Resistance Bands - 5 Loop Fitness Bands Set - Exercise Resistance Loop Bands - Exercise Bands For Legs And Arms - Carry Bag</p>

<p>Are you ready for the most versatile, results producing workout bands on the market?</p>

<p>These bands are ideal for
- Sports
- Fitness
- Injury rehabilitation
- body shaping
- weight loss
- physical therapy</p>

<p>Our bands are the best among others. Why?</p>

<p>First, our bands are made of highest quality 100% genuine eco-friendly latex (not rubber bands which are much cheaper and tend to break easily). They are stronger and able to stretch further. You will feel the same resistance after a dozen reps.</p>

<p>These bands are free of non-natural materials such as Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) - TPE materials cost 40% less, are not gentle to skin and much less durable.</p>

<p>Second, our bands are comfortable, soft and easy on the skin. The only way to achieve that is to let the latex rest for a long time in tightly controlled circumstances such as temperature and humidity before making the bands.</p>

<p>Both of these involve a higher investment for us but we think it&rsquo;s worth it to create a better product.</p>

<p>What makes our resistance bands special?</p>

<p>These bands are rigorously tested to be snap, stretch and sweat resistant.</p>

<p>You get 5 resistance bands set and you can combine multiple bands to find your ideal resistance.</p>

<p>These bands are so lightweight that they make a great travel fitness kit!</p>

<p>This is also a great Christmas, Mother&rsquo;s and Father&rsquo;s day gift idea for men, women, dad or mom.</p>

<p>100% Lifetime Money Back Guarantee!</p>

<h5 id="while-shopping-this-fitness-trainer-stopped-me-and-said-that-i-was-doing-a-good-thing-he-was-surprised-and-said-it-was">While shopping this fitness trainer stopped me and said that I was doing a good thing. He was surprised and said it was &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have many of my friends into them now. People ask me about them everywhere I go because I WHERE THEM (almost) EVERYWHERE. I don&rsquo;t just use them during exercise. As long as I&rsquo;m walking, running errands, working, moving around I&rsquo;m getting the benefits of the resistance bands. Sometimes I wear more than one level. I really feel then working my thighs and glutes muscles. These are no joke. I use the when doing any exercises that lift my rear end&hellip; (Whatever&hellip;don&rsquo;t judge me lol!) THEY WORK! The pic is of me wearing one under my pencil skirt at work&hellip;I have videos and pictures of other days and times that I wear them. Got my family and friends to try them out. They are ordering them too. While shopping this fitness trainer stopped me and said that I was doing a good thing. He was surprised and said it was a good idea to just wear them about. If I can get the video and the pictures from my Snapchat which is where I posted my use of them I&rsquo;ll submit those also.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bands">Great Bands!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These bands are awesome! 5 bands and brief exercise pamphlet of sample exercises. The strength starts at extra light to extra heavy. I started with the &ldquo;light&rdquo; one and wow, the bands are really! I have to work up to medium lol. The bands are very durable. The price was even great! I&rsquo;ve been taking my bands to the gym cuz there&rsquo;s never enough to go around and I just wrap it around my wrist or stick in my pocket bcuz it folds really flat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-at-great-price">High Quality at great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect set of bands! They are high quality and labeled clearly and the pouch is awesome to carry them in. Excellent exercises suggested in the instructional pamphlet. A great asset to my weight training routine!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="same-product-lower-cost">Same product, lower cost.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Same as I can get from my physical therapist&rsquo;s office but at a fraction of the cost.I just wish they&rsquo;d offer a set of 5 that are all the same resistance level.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-one-small-problem">Great but one small problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These seem to be great quality. I chose these bands based on the numerous positive reviews and it being a best seller. However, I did want to point out one defect in my band set. The heavy band is actually not as difficult as the medium band. Although it is thicker, it is about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch longer than the medium, so it actually feels about the same, maybe a little easier. I can make due but that is the reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-compact-set">Nice compact set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I needed to augment my PT and fitness programs. The bands are not &ldquo;clingy,&rdquo; which makes them comfortable to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These bands are good quality, easy to use, and the variety makes the applications very versatile. I&rsquo;m so glad I bought them to add variety to my current exercise routines. Their portability means I can take them to work, to the gym, and on travel. Thanks, Fit Simplify. Great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-great-but-not-horrible">Not great, but not horrible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I would have done some more research on the type of bands that I wanted. These will do, but for 10 dollars i would&rsquo;ve just bought the thicker longer resistance bands from another company.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-recommend">I recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend these bands. They are well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-traveling-or-at-home-workouts">A must have for traveling (or at home) workouts!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is perfect. Total workout equipment , tiny enough to travel and an easy to follow instruction pamphlet! Great package and quick courteous delivery</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-other-bands-are-relatively-useless-unless-used-by-a-child">All other bands are relatively useless unless used by a child</h5>

<p>Only black band provides any decent resistance. All other bands are relatively useless unless used by a child.</p>
