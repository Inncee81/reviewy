<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-great">Works Great !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this screen to replace my old shattered iphone screen. Product was packaged very well, and the packing is pretty decent,and with all tools needed plus some that I didn&rsquo;t need. Instruction booklet was very easy to follow. Any small mistake with putting the wrong screw in the wrong place could ruin your phone completely! (Example: long-screw damage)So putting the screws to the corresponding position while removing from mixing them;I did not have experienced replacing screens on any phone. I ordered my screen, followed all instructions in the booklet. Thank goodness I did NOT make a mistake with the screws because of the detailed steps showed on the instructions and the videos by scanning the QR code;Attention:You must work slowly and delicately! You have to pay attention to everything you do. If the screen doesn&rsquo;t work after installation,please connect the cable again(for I tried twice to make it work,for the first time ,I didn’t connect it properly cause no images display;It works great now)</p>

<h5 id="i-phone-6-replacement-screen-is-by-far-the-best-quality-i-have-seen">&hellip; I phone 6 replacement screen is by far the best quality I have seen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This I phone 6 replacement screen is by far the best quality I have seen. It looks great on my phone. Came with a great setup and a really nice tool set. Highly recommend over other iPhone 6 replacement screens. Make sure to follow instructions and always beware of the proximity sensor failing. It happened to me. But I&rsquo;m still working on how to fix it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="iphone-6-owner">iPhone 6 owner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent packaging. Color instructions, phone picture magnet, and all the tools you need included. It even came with a hard screen protector. I was definitely impressed. Only issue is a very small light blue blemish near the bottom left side of the screen about a half inch from the corner. I&rsquo;m definitely not gonna worry about it. I&rsquo;m overall very excited my screen it fixed. I did all the work myself. I&rsquo;ve done a hand full of screen replacements for my family over the years. It took me shy of two hours to do the replacement. I ordered and got the next day shipping with Prime.Update: screen is now flickering. I have contacted RSTH and the communication is good so far. Keep you posted.</p>

<h5 id="good-screen-replacement-kit">good screen replacement kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the lcd went haywire on my phone and i decided to buy this replacement kit instead of overpay someone to fix it.They give you plenty of tools to get it fixed in the kit. 4 stars instead of 5 because the Phillips head screwdriver tool wasnt as fitting for the screws as well as it should have been. I ended up using a different very small Phillips which worked way better and made it easier to remove the several screws contained in the phone for the replacement process. As far as the replacement screen itself- it works great and that is why you should buy this kit if you own an iPhone 6 that needs a new screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Update again:The service of this company is awesome. They contacted me about the problem I had, and gave satisfying solutions. I&rsquo;d buy from them again.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-update:Been two months, the screen works fine except when the phone is hot during charging, then the screen stops working, random things just happen. So far it went back to normal once I cool the phone down.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-/&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;/&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;/&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-/&mdash;&mdash;It works, and it has been a few weeks, no problem yet. Though you should know it&rsquo;s not the original, so it won&rsquo;t fit perfectly, I can see light coming out from the edge. Also the color is a bit different, the white has a tinge of pink, not a big deal for me though. Overall pretty good, phone is functioning and looking pretty. You do need to watch tutorials on YouTube before you start.</p>

<h5 id="works-fine-and-way-cheaper-than-the-local-repair-shop">Works fine and way cheaper than the local repair shop.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The kit was great! It even came with a nifty little magnet to keep all the tiny screws organized. My main complaints are that the battery life with the new screen is severely effected (which is to be expected) and also the instruction book could be a little bit larger so the images are easier to see. A bit of advice; first, maybe lay off the coffee for a few hours as you will need a steady hand, second, when reassembling the screen and plugging in the ribbon cables make sure you take EVERY precaution to assure this is done correctly and gently. Plan the layout ahead of time (watching a video might help more than the booklet) and be ever so careful when handling the ribbons themselves as they are beyond fragile. I pretty much ruined my home button cable during this process. On the bright side after suffering through the process you will be a ninja at dealing with the tiny screws.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-highly-recommend">Great product, highly recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second time I have replaced the screen on my wife&rsquo;s iphone (toddler). The first time, I used the cheapest option I could fine. That screen did not last long and the kit was terrible. This kit was much better and the screen feels high quality. The tools were better, it came with a magnetized mat to keep all the parts organized, which was greatly appreciated. Also, the included screwdriver is magnetized, which makes the process 10x easier. I had the screen replaced in about 20 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen-replacement-kit">Great screen replacement kit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit came with everything I needed and worked perfectly on the first try. I followed the instructions as well as watching a youtube video on the process so I could see exactly how everything was done and did the replacement with no issue. The screen is clear and responsive and no different than my original as far as I can tell.</p>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy Customer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Packaging was beautiful, instructions were clear, included items were helpful. All in all I am very pleased. The screen looks great.</p>
