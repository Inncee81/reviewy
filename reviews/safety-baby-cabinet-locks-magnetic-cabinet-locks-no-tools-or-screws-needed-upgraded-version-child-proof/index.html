<h5 id="works-perfectly">Works perfectly!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these locks. I purchased them because my brother has some that are very similar and they love them. I thought i would try them out and see if they work with my cabinets. My son is 4 but we still wanted to lock up the cabinets under the sick where the dishwasher packets are and the cleaning supplies. They were super easy to install with the little installation slip thing that is included. They work through fairly thick wood too. Where i had to install them the cabinet door is at least 1.5 inches thick and even though the magnet doesnt stay when you stick it there it is strong enough to unlock the cabinet so we can get into it. I only used 2 but will be adding them to all of our bathrooms for when we have future kids. Love them will probably purchase more in the future.</p>

<h5 id="finally-no-marks">Finally no marks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally I found product with good price, quality and meeting my expectations.I have a two year old at home and he is already figured out how to open up mechanical baby stoppers (that one where you are use your finger to press to open). So I found this one and they are even better.No show, easy and quick install but the main plus you can not open them without a key, that is definitely a win situation.One more big plus they are easy to remove, you don&rsquo;t need to use nails/screws to attach/detached them. But you going to get a screws in a kit in case you want to go hardcore.I received a small pretty box with everything I need inside plus instructions. Six locks plus two keys, another great thing is two keys in case you lost one or installing locks in a different rooms.Definitely worth the money.</p>

<h5 id="great-locks">Great locks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bable safety baby cabinet locks, magnetic cabinet locks are amazing for anyone who has young toddlers. My daughter has always been very interested in getting into every cabinet that is in the house. My cousin had locks like these and I had to get these. These are going to come in handy for when my nephew gets older and is trying to get into my cabinets. These are super easy to install and easy to use. You get 2 keys, 6 latches, 6 locks, 1 assistant installer, 2 key holders, 1 pack of screws, and 1 user manual. I think every parent needs to own these, I&rsquo;ve tried other locks and they haven&rsquo;t worked as well as these.</p>

<h5 id="finally-closed-cabinets-from-the-child">Finally!! Closed cabinets from the child!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So glad I got these magnetic baby child proof locks, came with 6 locks and 2 magnetic keys. Perfect for the kitchen and the bathroom. I don&rsquo;t know how many times my son has gone through the chemical cabinets under the sink and the bathroom. These locks were really easy to install, clear instructions on the manual. Also came with screws just in case he is stronger than I think he is, so I can screw on the locking latch as well as using the 3M tapes. Which I want to point out, the tapes are pretty adhesive and stick quite well. Great product to have, highly recommend it. I will probably get more for the rest of the house. I have a video as well to show how easy it took, less than 2 minutes to get it installed</p>

<h5 id="best-child-safety-locks-i-have-ever-used">Best child safety locks I have ever used!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love these Childproof locks! They were so simple to put on my cabinets! I&rsquo;ve had other child safety locks before &amp; they were a pain to put up, BUT these took a total of maybe 20 minutes to do. I love the feature that you can keep the cabinets unlocked with a flip of a switch when the cabinets don&rsquo;t need locked. I didn&rsquo;t realize but these locks came with 2 &ldquo;keys&rdquo; (strong magnets) and both keys had a sticky tab base to hang so it isn&rsquo;t misplaced. I love the quality of these &amp; I would definitely buy these again!</p>

<p>Very fun, very safe, hidden very good, non-installed people, can not know the specific location!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-it">i like it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installation is very simple, really very easy to use, very satisfied with a shopping</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="smart-template">Smart template</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This isn&rsquo;t my first set of magnetic childlock (had never used the ones w/latch because somehow the kids know they are add ons and begin to ripe them, these ones they don&rsquo;t know they are there LOL) I can&rsquo;t believe I needed so many until my monkey gets into everything, the console, the kitchen cabinet, and the worse of it bathroom vanity cabinet that has all the cleaning supplies. I chose this one because it has a template. The other ones that doesn&rsquo;t have template also works but it takes some guess work/remove/reapply to make everything fit. The template is actually pretty smart and the magnet is strong compare to my other ones because it response better even I don&rsquo;t have it exactly on the spot. It also comes in a frustration free cardboard box that can be recycled, no unnecessary packaging is a plus in my mind! :)</p>
