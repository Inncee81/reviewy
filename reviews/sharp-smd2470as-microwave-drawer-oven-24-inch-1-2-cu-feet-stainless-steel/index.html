<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="looks-and-works-great">Looks and works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks and works great! Very pleased with the look and function of this microwave.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sharp-is-the-best-value-best-fit-the-opening-for-our-below-counter">Sharp is the best value &amp; best fit the opening for our below-counter &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did my research&hellip;found out that all microwave drawers are made by Sharp with other labels installing their own fronts&hellip;.and prices. Sharp is the best value &amp; best fit the opening for our below-counter installation. Sharp does make a less expensive model but we chose this one because of the clean lines and tilt-out control panel. During my research I learned drawer microwaves can have serious mechanical problems. I purchased the Square Trade 4 yr warranty (at an additional cost) so I don&rsquo;t have to fight the manufacturer if our new drawer microwave decides to commit suicide.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buyer-beware">Buyer Beware.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving up on Sharp after the second microwave they sent us had the same exact problem as the first: Horrible grating noise (like a garbage disposal) with smoke &amp; a terrible electrical burning smell coming from unit. The first microwave and service call was covered under warranty, but to have someone come look at the second unit to verify what was wrong would have been $100+. Even then Sharp said they would only cover the magnetron if that was found to be the problem.Way too much trouble for what was supposed to be a top of the line product. Going with a basic countertop microwave instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-we-love-it">So far so good. We love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. We love it. This microwave looks fantastic in our kitchen island and it functions perfectly well. I do have some concerns with how it will hold up to regular use. The drawer open/close feature is motor actuated. Im not sure if it will last as long as the rest of the electronics especially around little kids. Mine are a tad impatient while waiting for the drawer to shut and tend to give it little nudges to help it along. I can totally see the bearings and assembly wearing out prematurely with this kind of abuse. Not sure if the drawer will be able to shut with some manual help in case the motor / actuator dies. Longevity concerns aside, we love this sharp microwave.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-this-product-a-defective-unit-google">DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - A DEFECTIVE UNIT -GOOGLE &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - A DEFECTIVE UNIT -GOOGLE THIS MODEL AND YOU WILL ALSO SEE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS.I BOUGHT THIS UNIT AND USED IT ONLY A WEEK BEFORE IT HAD PROBLEMS. I WAS HEATING MY TEA WHEN IT BEGAN TO MAKE A STRANGE NOISE, I OPEN UP THE DRAWER AND I COULD SEE WHITE SMOKE AND SMELL SOMETHING BURNING. THE SERVICE MAN SAID HE HAS SEEN THIS SAME PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS MODEL. HE SAID THE MODEL MOTOR QUITS TURNING AND IT STARTS TO BURN A HOLE IN THE CAVITY. HE SENT PICTURES TO SHARP AND TOLD ME THAE WOULD SEND A REPLACEMENT. I CALLED SHARP AND EXPLAINED BECAUSE OF A FIRE HAZARD I DID NOT WANT A REPLACEMENT- I WANTED A REFUND. THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT REIMBURSE ME BECAUSE OF WARRANTY. I PURCHASED THE UNIT ON NOV. 2015 BUT BECAUSE I WAS REMODELING MY HOME - I JUST HAD THE UNIT INSTALLED AND HAD JUST STARTED USING IT. AT SOME POINT THEY WILL HAVE A LAWSUIT ON THERE HANDS. THEY NEED TO RECALL THIS MODEL.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="glad-we-went-with-this-one">Glad we went with this one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the negative reviewers might have gotten lemons because ours works great. Yes, there&rsquo;s no carosel so food doesn&rsquo;t heat as evenly as it would in a carosel microwave but I&rsquo;m happy to make that trade for having a hidden microwave as opposed to an eye-sore in my pretty new kitchen. Mine definitely heats food better than the reviewer who said it just got the plate hot &amp; not the food. Haven&rsquo;t had that problem at all. We have been using it for almost a year now. Also I have found the drawer style to be easier to clean. Overall we&rsquo;re very happy with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="manufacturing-defect-on-front-door">Manufacturing Defect on Front Door</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product and it arrived with large spots on the door. I was told to contact Sharp directly and they told me this was not covered under its warranty. It really is amazing that Sharp&rsquo;s response to this $1200 microwave was &ldquo;tough luck&rdquo;. My case number is 8565782 in case Sharp decides to do the right thing (which I doubt). Attached is a photo and these spots are everywhere on the front door and cannot be removed with cleaning</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-getting-to-know-my-fancy-microwave">Just Getting to Know My Fancy Microwave</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This microwave was recently installed as I redo my kitchen. It looks nice and sleek in my island. It does heat faster than my old microwave. I have to pay attention to this change. I did read the reviews on this item before I bought it. Some of the reviews were mixed so I decided to research other models. I discovered in this process that all of the in drawer microwaves are made by Sharp. They have the patent. As a result, you can spend $500 more for the same microwave with a high end name but it is still made by Sharp.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-this-microwave">DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had the 30&rdquo; built in unit. Had my cabinets customized around this unit. Paid over $1,200 and it just completely died. I can&rsquo;t believe it. What a piece of crap.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="serious-electrical-hazard-issue">Serious Electrical Hazard Issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our microwave has been installed for less than year and used minimally. While heating some food, a loud buzzing/electrical sound occurred and smoke (electrical smoke &ndash; not from&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="we-have-had-it-for-a-couple-months-and-certain">We have had it for a couple months and certain &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have had it for a couple months and certain buttons on the control panel, including the &ldquo;Stop/Clear&rdquo; button and the number pad no longer work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dented-microwave-out-of-the-box">Dented Microwave out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We started a kitchen remodel in January and love the idea of a drawer microwave. Just now able to get installed we took out of the box and found the front door has a dent in it..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="completes-basic-microwave-tasks-not-worth-a-1000">Completes basic microwave tasks, Not worth a $1000</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that this is an okay microwave. The microwave works fine as a microwave no doubt, the issues are more having to do with the operation and moving features.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-undercounter-microwave">This is a great undercounter microwave</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great undercounter microwaver. We installed under a new island below some new countertops. Plenty powerful at 1000W, and fits into a standard 24&rdquo; wide cabinet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="under-countermicrowave-draw">Under countermicrowave draw.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! No more bending over to select controls and load/unload. Love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice&hellip; the answer to the design of our dream kitchen</p>
