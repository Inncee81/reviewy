<h5 id="i-replaced-these-with-another-model">I replaced these with another model.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect terribly much of these for the price, but still it did not meet my expectations. I purchased four of these to mount screens for a video wall. They went unused because of their flimsy quality. Flimsy meaning the metal is even somewhat pliable. One of the four release cords broke the first time I pulled it. The release mechanism itself is okay, but I would recommend treating it with care if you go with this mount. The metal is thin enough that I was able to remove the mount from the wall despite it being screwed into the wall. The mounting channels spread or bent enough to fit over the large screw heads. I grant that this was not normal use, and you may find an application for these mounts, but I would not recommend it for any rugged environment, or one with young children who might put expected strain it, etc. These just aren&rsquo;t all that durable.I replaced them with another model sold on Amazon. I would have enjoyed the value price of these mounts, but it turned out to be a false economy for my application. I only wish I had opened them before my return window had expired. Hopefully you fair better, should you choose to order.</p>

<h5 id="great-mount-just-don-t-use-the-built-in-bubble-level">Great mount, just don&rsquo;t use the built in bubble level.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hung a 40&rdquo; Samsung on here with no problem. Had to use my own bolts to mount the tv to the rack, but that is because there are so many options for different bolt sizes for tvs. The unit does come with a very nice assortment of bolts though. I ended up using some for a swivel mount that I also put up over the weekend.DO NOT use the built in level that comes on the mount. As I was eyeing up the mount while holding it to the wall, I thought it looked a little off kilter, even though the rack was saying it was level. I pulled out my level, and I was right, it was off. It also comes with a little 6&rdquo; level in the box, but I didn&rsquo;t bother with that at all. Taking off the one star for that, because it would honestly be better off without the bubble level built in.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-shallow-installations">Perfect for shallow installations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great when you need as shallow of an install as possible. I used this to install a flatpanel TV to an exterior compartment on our camper. Instructions were trouble-free and the compartment shuts without interfering with the TV.Only drawback I noticed is that there&rsquo;s really nothing keeping the TV from sliding left to right besides its own weight. Not a problem in your house, but on a camper you definitely want things to stay stationary. Looking into modifications to block the rails but for now I just kept the styrofoam that came with the TV to protect the edges.</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-design-and-quick-installation">Sturdy Design, and Quick Installation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATED 6/6/14<strong>Overview: 4.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, Quality product, unbeatable for price. Easy to install, sturdy construction, decent grade metal.</strong>This was my first time buying a TV wall mount. I was attempting to mount an older monitor to the wall, and due to its age (5 years old) I was hesitant to buy a super fancy wall bracket in case it didn&rsquo;t fit. Much to my happiness, this bracket came with a plethora of hardware - worth noting, there were 10 and 20 thread-depth versions of M3, M4, and M5 screws. For those out there who don&rsquo;t understand this callout, what it essentially means is that the hardware included is sufficient to fix the bracket to the vast majority of major brand TVs/ monitors. It also comes with plastic standoffs in case the back of your screen is slightly curved. Hooray no trip to the hardware store!The included instructions were simple and easy to follow. Bracket construction was a breeze, and I was done building and affixing the pieces designed for the rear of the TV in less then 10 minutes. Installation of the wall-mounted piece took a little more time (finding studs and such), and the built-in level made this task much easier. I was able to do it solo, but two people would have made it a little quicker.NOTE: The lag bolts included for affixing the wall piece are <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> in. outer diameter - <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in. pilot holes are STRONGLY SUGGESTED, unless you feel like destroying your drywall in the process of installation.Whatever screen you are attaching to the wall can be done solo, and in my opinion it is easier to seat properly this way (unless you are mounting a super heavy/ super unwieldy screen). It sets in place with a satisfying click when it is locked in, and can be slid side-to-side for adjustment depending on how far apart your screen-attached brackets ended up being. To take your screen off the bracket, however, at least 2 people are required. One to disengage the locks with some nifty pull-tabs, another to lift the screen off.NOTE: The lever arms the pull-tabs operate might feel a little loose or too tight - this is adjustable via small twists of an easily identifiable screw. I was able to fix my loose one no sweat.Due to the very low-profile nature of this wall mount (it really is an inch), It would be smart to attach all cabling to your screen before mounting. Saved me a bit of time.My only complaint, which isn&rsquo;t really even merited given the absurdly low cost of this item, is that when everything was said and done, there was a slight front-to-back wiggle. This is caused by the tolerances necessary for the screen-side bracket to fit the wall-side bracket without pinching and scraping, and is not a manufacturing defect. I do not foresee this ever being an issue for me, but if there was a high-magnitude earthquake and your mounted screen weighed over 100 lbs, well, it was probably going to come off the wall anyways.It&rsquo;s been on my wall for about a week, and is showing no signs of loosening or metal fatigue. The screen I have mounted is large, and weighs approximately 50 lbs (like I said, 5 years old).Exponentially satisfied with this product, especially for the price paid. Would rate 4.5 stars if possible, only detracting stars because of slight design tomfoolery (I&rsquo;m a mechanical engineer, so I notice these things), and the wiggle issue that MIGHT pose a problem for large/ heavy/ expensive gear. But hey, if you&rsquo;re planning to wall-mount a $750+ screen, why are you even looking at sub-$20 mounts in the first place?I&rsquo;ll update this review as time goes on. Cheers!<strong>Updates!</strong>Still no issues. Traded out the original monitor I had mounted for a different with a totally different hole pattern on the back, this fit it perfectly! Holding up well after 2 months!</p>

<h5 id="for-the-price-i-would-recommend-the-mount">For the price I would recommend the mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price I would recommend the mount. The instructions are printed on the box of the mount itself, and they&rsquo;re in the most difficult to read blurry printing. The pictures are slightly more useful to use.The wall mount does NOT come assembled. There is some assembly required for this mount. Coming back to the hard to read instructions and pictures, if you are not technically inclined and have somewhat handy skills, you might need help.It&rsquo;s a pretty low tech way to mount a tv. What it DOESNT SAY is that the tv when mounted can STILL slide left and right on the wall bracket.</p>

<h5 id="easy-install-tough-removal">Easy install, tough removal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Install and stability: A+ &hellip; removal: D. Here&rsquo;s how to get the TV off if you (a) break a strap or (b) one of your straps - like mine - is twisted up in a way that makes it non-functional and you don&rsquo;t notice until you put it up. Step 1: Panic at the thought that your new television is permanently fused to the wall. Step 2: Walk away and take some deep breaths. Step 3: Scavenge your house for a long, thin object. I used a skinny curtain rod. Step 4: Insert your curtain rod (or whatever) between the TV and the mount so it depresses both of the locking clips. Make sure it&rsquo;s wedged in tight. Step 5: Grab TV with both hands and lift straight up.Would&rsquo;ve been 5 stars had it come with the curtain rod!</p>
