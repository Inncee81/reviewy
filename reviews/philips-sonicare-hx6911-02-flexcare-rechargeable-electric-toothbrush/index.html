Product Description
FlexCare delivers the superior cleaning you are looking for with the flexibility that your oral health care demands. The new ProResults brush heads and personal care settings are all found in a brush design that is smaller, lighter and has less vibration that any other Sonicare toothbrush.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
The Sonicare FlexCare R910 toothbrush features the latest innovations in oral hygiene from Philips to deliver the cleanest, most refreshing teeth you can get between dentist visits. It features new ProResults brush heads, multiple cleaning modes, and built-in timers.</p>

<p>Feel like you just went to the dentist, every day.

<p>New Brush Heads for Better Cleaning
The FlexCare uses the newly designed ProResults brush heads with increased tooth coverage and a broader sweeping motion that results in better plaque removal. Combined with Sonicare&rsquo;s sonic technology, the high-speed bristle action allows a powerful yet gentle cleaning action that ensures a deep cleaning between teeth and along the gum line. With a slim, angled neck, the FlexCare makes it is easy to access hard-to-reach areas of the mouth. The ProResults brush heads come in two sizes: &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for a regular cleaning, and &ldquo;mini&rdquo; for precision in hard-to-reach areas.</p>

<p>The toothbrush handle also has a new tapered design that is easier to grip, and with a non-slip soft grip for better control. Compared to the Sonicare Elite, the FlexCare is 30 percent smaller, 16 percent lighter, and has 80 percent less vibration, but achieves superior results.</p>

<p>Multiple Cleaning Modes
The FlexCare offers maximum flexibility with your teeth cleaning. There are three two-minute brushing modes that offer &ldquo;Clean&rdquo; mode for full power and optimal cleaning, &ldquo;Sensitive&rdquo; mode for gentler brushing in sensitive areas, and &ldquo;Massage&rdquo; mode for a stimulating, soothing cleaning action.</p>

<p>The FlexCare also offers two routines: &ldquo;GoCare&rdquo; is a quick one-minute routine for between regular brushings, and &ldquo;MaxCare&rdquo; is a three-minute cleaning mode that combines two minutes of &ldquo;Clean&rdquo; mode with one minute of &ldquo;Massage&rdquo; mode.</p>

<p>Thanks to the FlexCare&rsquo;s Quadpacer, the toothbrush beeps every thirty seconds to let you know it is time to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth. The brush also features a Smartimer that automatically shuts off the toothbrush after the recommended two minutes of cleaning (unless using the MaxCare routine).</p>

<p>And for first-time users of FlexCare, an &ldquo;easy-start&rdquo; feature allows you to work your way up to full strength by gently increasing the power over your first 14 uses.</p>

<p>Long Lasting Battery
With a lithium ion battery, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of power when you&rsquo;re traveling; with regular brushing, the FlexCare lasts up to two weeks between charges. A deluxe recharge gauge on the handle keeps you notified of the amount of charge left.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box:
Sonicare toothbrush, one ProResults standard brush head, deluxe charger with cord wrap and brush head storage, luxury soft travel case, hygienic travel cap, three additional color code rings.</p>

<p>FlexCare R910 Toothbrush offers:
Three cleaning modes including Clean, Sensitive, and Massage
Lithium ion battery that lasts up to 2 weeks between charges.
ProResults brush head for more effective clean teeth.
Smartimer that automatically shuts off the toothbrush after the recommended 2 minutes.</p>

<p>New ProResults brush heads have increased coverage for more plaque removal.</p>

<h5 id="finally-had-it">Finally had it&hellip;&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to congratulate folks at Phillips/Sonicare on hiring the most talented engineers money can buy. With a precision of a swiss time piece they manage to estimate the life cycle of the battery to die right after the warranty expires. When I say “right after” I truly mean it. So you are stuck with a great piece of hardware that you have to throw it away because the batteries are non-replacable.This is my 3rd (and last) toothbrush from them. In anger I had purchased Oral-B 7000 and could not be happier.Sonicare vs Oral BSonicare handle feel more ergonomic than Oral-BSonicare vibrations feel more intense, Oral-B feels more mechanicalSonicare non replaceable battery (deal breaker for me at this point) Oral-B removable batteryOral-B separate display showing your brush time, warns you if you are pressing too hard. In addition, it has a nice LED light on the toothbrush itself showing you if you press too hard.Sonicare- I always hated the crud one had to clean between the head and the unit. In addition if you are not religious enough about it, you will start getting mildew right under the rubber seal on the bottom of the handle. None of those issues are possible with Oral-B.My overall feeling is Oral-B is more of a no nonsense get the job done type of toothbrush. While Sonicare is still riding on its ultra high rpm technology making you feel like your teeth are cleaner.Bottom Line- both are great toothbrushes, but unless you are ok shelling our $150 every 2-3 years, Oral-B is a better buy.Last but not least- Your experience may vary, but my teeth are cleaner with Oral-B. Not sure if a smaller head does a better job or it’s the technology itself, but I have definitely less plaque.</p>

<h5 id="after-1-5-year-of-time-it-starts-causing-problems-and-it-has-only-2-year-warranty">After 1.5 year of time, it starts causing problems and it has only 2 year warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product comes with 2-year warranty and it is exactly designed for 2 year life-time. I am very disappointed with the customer service and the return policy.Here are the facts:In every 3-4 months, you will need to change the heads and it is a commitmentThis item is over 100 US Dollars and that means, you are paying $50/year for the body only.Experience:After more than a year of use, it started not working. I called the customer service and went through some troubleshooting and re-setting documents. It seemed OK for a while. Then, one day in the middle of the night, it started by itself (while plugged into the charge unit) making a lot of noise. Couple days later, it is not even working&hellip;I again called and this time asked for a replacement. Oooops, they can&rsquo;t help me because it has only a 2-year-warranty. Then, I complained and the conversation turned into a questionnaire where I am asked if I dropped it and caused the issue.Recommendation:Overall, I was happy with the item until it got broken. If it starts giving you issues. Ask for a return immediately. Do not wait/ go through troubleshooting experience.</p>

<h5 id="a-good-toothbrush-with-a-limited-lifespan">A Good Toothbrush With A Limited Lifespan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had this product for almost 6 years and it was a very serviceable toothbrush during that time. About half way through the product&rsquo;s life it began to no longer charge and I was sent a replacement charger that helped address the problem, but it quickly redeveloped. Thankfully the product has a good warranty and the manufacturer was able to replace the item for no additional cost. I continued to use the replacement for several years after they sent it out and it worked just as well as the original had. After about 3 years of use the item abruptly stopped charging as well. I tried everything I could, including several different chargers, but the product had reached the end of its life.From this I was able to ascertain that this is a high quality product that really does make you feel like you have just gone to the dentist after every time you use it. However, it&rsquo;s useful life appears to be roughly 3 years based on the two that I have owned thus far. Given the design of the product, once the battery will no longer charge it effectively kills the entire product as it cannot be replaced. However, for the price 3 years of usefulness is worth it.</p>

<h5 id="high-quality-toothbrush-but-i-ended-up-paying-for-lots-of-features-i-never-used">High quality toothbrush, but I ended up paying for lots of features I never used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sonicare toothbrushes work very well. My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with a traditional toothbrush. I bought one of these (Flexcare), and it lasted 3 years and 4 months.I had used the basic Elite series for a while, but the screw-in brushes got gross and smelly, so when the toothbrush died, I got the flex care. I like the snap on brush heads for these brushes. These are great brushes and do a great job cleaning, but I think they are too expensive and they include features I never used (and would bet most people don&rsquo;t use).When this one died, I decided to go with the most basic Sonicare toothbrush that had the quadpacer and this style of snap-on brush head. At the time of this review, that ends up being the Gum Health Sonicare, which is $80 vs. the Flexcare at $130. So far, I&rsquo;m happy with the gum health toothbrush, but it&rsquo;s only been a week. It&rsquo;s not quite as sleek as the Flexcare, but given that I never used the advanced features of the Flexcare, I feel like I&rsquo;ve made a smarter purchase this time around. We&rsquo;ll see how long it lasts though.</p>

<p>Great brush but it doesn&rsquo;t last long. Like most Philips tooth brushes and trimmers, it failed at a 3-year mark. Great results, it makes reaching the back teeth easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-and-authentic">Great price and authentic!</h5>

<p>Wonderful toothbrush. I have been using soniccare for over 12 years. I&rsquo;m on my 3rd brush. Handsets usually last 5 years plus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As advertised</p>

<h5 id="poor-design">Poor design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Gets low rating because the unit cannot be kcleaned; mold at bottom forms and cannot be removed forever. Even my dentist says this design is flawed.</p>
