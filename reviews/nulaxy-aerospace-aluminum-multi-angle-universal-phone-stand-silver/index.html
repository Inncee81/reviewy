<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-4-7-inch-devices">Great for 4.7 inch devices</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Shortly after I left this review, a friendly rep from the company reached out to contact me and see if they could make things better by offering to let me try out an updated version of this product, which I was happy to accept, given my phone&rsquo;s unusually large dimensions.The updated version of the stand is PERFECT for my thick case in combo with large heavy phone, PLUS it folds flat for travel!It does exactly what I wanted&ndash;hold my phone up vertically while charging. Very sturdy and same nice finish as previous model. I love the fact that it&rsquo;s foldable, making it highly adjustable for many viewing or recording angles (while holding my phone up!)More about the original product listed here: I have had an opportunity to test it with a smaller 4.7 inch device, which fits much better on the stand without toppling backward easily. Ideally, those with smaller devices should go for this item, and those who intend to use it with a bulky battery case or &ldquo;otterbox&rdquo;-type, thick case would do well to go with Nulaxy Foldable Aluminum Stand Multi-Angle Universal Stand for Phones, iPad, Black.I&rsquo;d like to thank Nulaxy for their kind, helpful and prompt customer service. The fact that they reached out reflects positively on their reputation and I raised my review rating to 5 stars for excellence. Thanks again for ensuring your customer&rsquo;s satisfaction!&mdash;ORIGINAL REVIEW below&mdash;This is a nice idea in concept, but I thought the movable part would be a bit bigger, as in a taller/longer and deeper/wider holder plate. The stand height is fine.I&rsquo;m sure it would work better for a smaller phone, but my iPhone 6s Plus is a little too long to use by itself at many angles. It simply falls backward, off the stand.It also doesn&rsquo;t fit my battery case, which means I have to pop that on and off every time, or just use my phone sideways, which defeats the purpose of buying a stand like this. I already had an ANKER stand that can hold my phone horizontally, but I wanted a vertical stand I can use while charging. I can only do that if I keep it propped at just the right angle with my case off. Ideally, the holster could be a bit bigger and made to accommodate bigger phones while still being able to access all their ports, like headphone jack and charger at the same time.Otherwise, I like the fact that it has the pass-through hole for cables, the design is sturdy and the hinge is strong enough to hold up my enormous phone with a heavy battery case attached. The finish is great, too.</p>

<h5 id="tray-not-deep-enough-but-otherwise-good">Tray not deep enough, but otherwise good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this a lot and sit it on my desk at work during the day. Only issue is that I use an eyn case which makes my phone pretty thick (maybe <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of an inch?), so it can&rsquo;t sit fully in the tray. I wish it was just a bit deeper so the &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; would go outside my phone, instead of my phone needing to rest on top of them. I&rsquo;m guessing anyone with a wallet or battery case will have this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-work-of-art">A Work of Art</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The design and execution of this stand are excellent. It is like a little work of art. The angle adjustment is smooth and tight. The finish is flawless.When I first received it, it was packaged in a flimsy cardboard box that screams &ldquo;cheap&rdquo;. I thought&hellip; oh no! but was very pleasantly surprised when I opened it up. I guess I am used to the way Apple packages thier products to increase expectations. This little jewel should arrive in a jewel box. My only criticism is that I worry about scratching my iPhone. It does have a bit of silicone in the lip but none on the area where the phone rests. I guess I will just have to be gentle when I put it on there. I would also like to see a way to clip the charging cord so that it doesn&rsquo;t pull out of the hole.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stylish-adjustable-desktop-phone-stand">Stylish, Adjustable Desktop Phone Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stand is a great idea. I love everything about it save one&hellip;my iPhone 6s with Mophie Battery Case will not fit into it! I needed a stand for my desktop so that I could position my phone horizontally or vertically as needed. I had to take the phone out of the case to make it fit, but that quickly became a deal buster, so I returned it. I was hoping it would work because it matches the gold Mophie case perfectly and looks very stylish. It also would have let me position the phone at different angles. Unfortunately, the Mophie case has rounded edges and is thicker than the width of the gap in the holder arms. I would highly recommend this stand, however, for those who use thinner cases or no case with their iPhones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fire-hd8-or-5-5-phone-all-fit-and">Fire HD8 or 5.5&rdquo; phone ALL fit and,..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i have had several different types of these stands over the past couple of years. each of the previous types had some good aspects but also negatives due to their designs. THIS one however finally hits all the &lsquo;sweet spots&rsquo; so to speak.The Good - the swivel design allows you to adjust the angle/pitch. important as it enables you to go from say a 5.5&rdquo; phone to the Fire HD8 tablet without sacrificing any stability. being able to change the where the center of gravity via the angle adjustment makes all the difference. the bottom plate is bent with sufficient room to hold either a thin smart phone or an 8&rdquo; tablet. better yet the way the ends are bent and notched upward adds to stability, reduces chance of something falling out of place no matter size. finish is flawless not a single blemish. ALL metal, real metal not some cheap &lsquo;pot metal&rsquo; as i&rsquo;ve found with others. no worries about scratching any surfaces as there are thin rubber pads on the bottom. last the cut outs on the back side enable you to thread cables through if you want to.The Bad - absolutely nothing!An excellent bargain for a stand that finally gets it all right!</p>

<h5 id="this-is-an-amazing-stand-for-my-iphone-7-plus">This is an amazing stand for my iphone 7 plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing stand for my iphone 7 plus! I wanted something at work to put my phone on, since I listen to music, or watch a few videos and didn&rsquo;t want to hold it or find ways to prop my phone up with office supples (come on, everyone does this right?). What I love most about this stand, is that it is sleek&hellip; I got the matte black, for my matte black iphone, and it just looks so sharp. I love that the angle is adjustable for your needs, and my coworkers are already asking me for the link to buy their own. It&rsquo;s great that it has the hole in the back so you can thread through your charger. absolutely love it!</p>

<h5 id="well-engineered-but">Well Engineered, but&hellip;</h5>
