<p>12 Megapixel One-Inch 4K-Compatible CMOS Image Sensor</p>

<p>The XC10 4K Camcorder features a new Canon 12.0 Megapixel 1-inch CMOS image sensor with 12 stops of dynamic range, and video and photo shooting functionality. The hybrid design makes the XC10 4K Camcorder a true crossover capable of satisfying the needs of both video and still workflows. With capture that includes both 4K and Full HD (FHD) video and still capture up to 12.0 Megapixels, the XC10 4K Camcorder is a strong contender in both market categories.</p>

<p>The advanced CMOS sensor uses Over-Sampling HD Processing for 1920x1080 capture, the same high-image-quality signal-processing system used by the high-end Canon EOS C500 4K Cinema camera.</p>

<p>The effective pixel total for the sensor&rsquo;s area ratio is approximately 6.8 times larger - and its area ratio per pixel approximately 1.6 times greater - than previous Canon HD CMOS PRO sensors. The result is low noise for low-light shooting, an impressive signal-to-noise ratio, and greater flexibility for creative shallow depth-of-field focusing effects.</p>

<p>XF-AVC Codec for 4K 30p and Full HD 60p</p>

<p>Click here for larger image
The Canon XC10 4K Camcorder incorporates the new Canon XF-AVC Codec to balance ease of workflow with a high standard of image quality. For 4K recording, the high-image-quality XF-AVC Intra-Frame encoding is used, which captures all the detail and resolution of the CMOS sensor on a frame-by-frame basis, enabling edits to be made at any point in a motion sequence and high-quality stills to be extracted from any 4K motion-image frame.</p>

<p>For HD recording, the camera&rsquo;s AVC Long GOP (Group of Pictures) encoding is used to help maintain outstanding quality and efficient data rates. Both XF-AVC codecs deliver H.264 4:2:2 8-bit MXF recording for full 4K recording up to 30p and HD recording up to 1080/60p HD.</p>

<p>The XC10 4K Camcorder also features an SD card slot, allowing Full HD video and photos to also be recorded separately on an SD card.</p>

<p>A SanDisk 64GB CFast 2.0 memory card and CFAST card reader are included with the XC10 camcorder.</p>

<p>As of June 2015, compatibility has been verified for the following CFast memory cards:</p>

<p>Manufacturer    Label   Model Numbers   Capacity
SanDisk Extreme PRO CFast 2.0 Card  SDCFSP-128G-xxxA    128 GB
Extreme PRO CFast 2.0 Card  SDCFSP-128G-xxxB    128 GB
Extreme PRO CFast 2.0 Card  SDCFSP-064G-xxxB    64 GB
Proper operation can not be guaranteed for all recording media. Long term usage may reduce a CFast card&rsquo;s write speed. We recommend users regularly fully format and refresh their card using the “Full Format and Refresh Tool”.</p>

<p>Canon Log and Wide Dynamic Range Gamma
The Canon XC10 4K Camcorder features the Canon Log gamma setting that sets the camera to maximize dynamic range and provide a wide exposure latitude. This is the same log curve used in both the EOS C300 and EOS C500 Cinema cameras, which helps maximize compatibility when the XC10 4K Camcorder is used in conjunction with them on the same shoot. The files produced using Canon Log can be ideal for post-production color-correction, matching and grading, as they provide users with a high level of creative post-production freedom while maintaining high image quality. When using Canon Log, the XC10 4K Camcorder can provide a dynamic range up to 800% or 12-stops.</p>

<p>The Canon XC10 4K Camcorder also provides the Canon Wide Dynamic Range Gamma function that allows users to get many of the benefits of Canon Log Gamma while maintaining an 18% graypoint similar to Rec. 709. By using this setting, users can maintain the full dynamic range of the sensor without the need for extensive post processing.</p>

<p>12 Stops Dynamic Range
Working in concert, the Canon 12.0 Megapixel 1-inch CMOS sensor, DiG!C DV 5 processor, and XF-AVC Codecs enable the Canon XC10 4K Camcorder to capture bright, highly detailed images at up to 20,000 ISO with a high dynamic range (12 stops of exposure latitude), and low picture noise.</p>

<p>Image Settings Compatible with Cinema EOS Cameras
The XC10 4K Camcorder shares a variety of image quality settings with other Canon Cinema EOS cameras including Canon Log, Wide DR, and EOS Std. This helps allow for video captured with the XC10 4K Camcorder to match the “look” of video captured with other Cinema EOS and EOS cameras. The XC10 4K Camcorder features a log gamma setting that sets the camera to maximize dynamic range and provide wide exposure latitude. This is the same log curve used in both the EOS C300 and EOS C500 cinema cameras, helping to maximize compatibility when multiple cameras are used on the same shoot. This is especially helpful in post-production, where corrections, color matching and grading are applied.</p>

<p>Workflow Versatility
The Canon XC10 4K Camcorder offers a true hybrid workflow solution for creatives that need to integrate both high quality video and still acquisition into their productions. The camcorder offers the ability to capture both 4K and HD imagery at a variety of frame rates and resolutions. Individual frames from the Canon XC10&rsquo;s 4K video can be extracted in camera or post and used as 8.3 Mpx still images. The XC10 4K Camcorder is also a fully functional 12Mpx still camera that is compatible with a wide variety of Canon photo accessories including Speedlite flashes, GPS Receiver, and remote controller.</p>

<p>DiG!C DV 5 Image Processor

<p>Freestyle Rotating Handgrip
The rotating handgrip on the XC10 4K Camcorder can be rotated to various positions and stopped at different points to allow for comfortable shooting at high angles, low angles, and even in between. The grip contributes to the camcorder&rsquo;s intuitive user (UI) interface with multiple easy-to-see and easy-to-adjust controls based on the familiar UI design of Canon EOS series cameras. Handgrip controls include the record button (clearly marked in red), a multi-selector thumb-control dial with a mechanical lock and a design similar to those of still cameras for quick-operation settings and highly visible profiles, a menu button, and other smoothly recessed buttons that stay out of the way but are always there when you need them.</p>

<p>Integrated LCD with Touch Panel
A three-inch 1.03-million-dot tilting LCD monitor provides Canon XC10 4K Camcorder with a bright, vivid-color display for shooting and playing back footage. The LCD&rsquo;s innovative two-axis parallel hinge mechanism allows the display to be placed in optimal positions for shooting at a variety of angles, from low to high. This LCD also integrates a highly advanced capacitive touch-panel for easy fingertip control of all camera functions and settings. Camera information can be displayed on-screen for clear and easy visual recognition of selected menu items, and users can also swipe from one menu page to another without vertical scrolling. The user interface of the XC10 4K Camcorder borrows many of the concepts from the Canon EOS system making the camera intuitive and easy to operate for users familiar with other Canon products.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="love-the-xc10">Love the XC10</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera arrived and I have been shooting with it for several days. I find the negative reviews about the camera to be entirely misleading. This is a wonderful tool. I have been shooting broadcast video for organizations like Discovery Channel, NatGeoTV, PBS and others since the 70&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve used field cameras from the TK-76 to the GY-HM750 and from the Red to the Cion . This camera is a joy to work with. The menu system that folks keep complaining about is really quite simply laid out&hellip;actually brilliantly designed, in my opinion. I find the GoPro menus much more challenging to navigate than the XC10. The controls are all exactly where they should be. The 4K footage is beautiful. The sensor is amazing. The lens is much more than I expected. I love the touch screen focus and the built in ND filter. I have been using the camera now for three days and I am extremely pleased with the camera design and the footage it delivers. The MXF files look clean and sharp next to natively shot ProRes files. The viewfinder is clean and sharp and easy to use. The touchscreen is responsive and large enough that fat fingers can touch the right spot. If you&rsquo;d rather use the joystick control&hellip;no problem.I understand this is not the perfect camera for every shooting situation. But it sure is a joy to use. Certainly there are compromises. How could there not be at this price? But none of them affect quality as far as I can tell. Canon has done a wonderful job designing and engineering this camera. Kudos to all involved.I am not a fully automatic shooter but I shot indoor and outdoor footage and a couple of interviews at fully automatic and am impressed beyond words. The audio levels, the video levels the color balance and focus are all spot-on. This camera is a remarkable step forward. At under $2K I am very, very impressed. If you have been reading reviews and have decided against this camera, please reconsider.If you are on a tight budget and need a professional camera, fully functional right out of the box&hellip;this is the one!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is getting a bad rap and I&rsquo;m here to set the record straight.Let&rsquo;s keep the main thing, the main thing and here&rsquo;s the main thing &hellip; How fast can you set-up a shot and how well does that shot or video look?That&rsquo;s the bottom line for ANY camera. With this unit you can slap in a card, turn it on, turn the focus rings and get a fabulous picture.YES, the XC10 has deep menus &hellip;so what? If I bought a professional camera without deep menus then that isn&rsquo;t a professional camera, that&rsquo;s called a point and shoot.People are complaining it doesn&rsquo;t have XLR input &hellip; again, so what? I get amazing sound with my Rode Micro plugged into the mic jack of the XC10.I see some &ldquo;first world problem&rdquo; complainers with this unit and I beg you to ignore them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="badly-needs-a-firmware-update">badly needs a firmware update</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>with the latest firmware (1.0.3.0) there&rsquo;s some very bad noise reduction artifacts. This same issue was just fixed on the C100 with a firmware update. I&rsquo;ve been in contact with Canon&rsquo;s technicians and they are currently investigating the problem and will hopefully release a similar firmware update soon. As soon as they do, I&rsquo;ll change my review to 5 stars because this is an otherwise very good camera. But with this noise reduction artifact problem, the image quality really suffers.Search youtube for &ldquo;Canon XC10 noise reduction ghosting&rdquo; to see an example.I am a fulltime professional photographer/videographer, by the way, and have shot several weddings and commercial video projects with this camera.</p>

<h5 id="extremely-underrated-cinema-camera">Extremely underrated cinema camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is probably the most underrated cinecam under $3000. The nay-sayers are not considering this for what it is. No, it is not a a7s mkii, so it is not meant to more or less see in the dark. That being said, it does pretty well; I have had usable footage at ISO upwards of 3200 ISO. The zoom range is good. Is the lens interchangable? No. But this lens was meant to be able to shoot 4k natively, and it does so well. 4k is great looking. no artifacts, very crisp, and with accurate colors.
