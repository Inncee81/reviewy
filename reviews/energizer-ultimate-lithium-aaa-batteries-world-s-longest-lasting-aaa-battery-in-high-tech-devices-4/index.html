<blockquote>
<p>Lithium Cells are rapidly becoming the new gold standard for many household uses, from simple flashlights to sophisticated hybrid vehicles. These lithium-ion batteries are now ubiquitous at the retail level and their popularity has steadily increased because of their power efficiency compared to more traditional delivery technologies far surpassing carbon-zinc, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride and alkaline.Here Is my Assessment of The Energizer AAA &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; Lithium:PROS:1. Superior in power efficiency compared to above-cited technologies. Lithium cells hold their charge longer and become superior performers in retaining their charge. When stored properly (in a cool, dry and dark environment), these cells self-discharge rates are substantially slower compared with previous generations of batteries.2. Unlike nickel-cadmium cells, lithium-ion batteries have no (or a very negligible) &ldquo;memory&rdquo; effect.3. Lithium Cells appear less likely to leak and are not as vulnerable to extreme temperatures compared with previous technologies.4. Lithium-Ion cells also perform better at lower ambient temperatures than their predecessors.5. Lithium-Ion batteries are noticeably lighter than previous types of cells making it an additional plus in heavier types of equipment such as larger flashlights, power equipment, etc.6. Energizer cells have expiration dates considerably longer because they discharge much more slowly compared to previous generations of batteries.7. Lithium cells are more environmentally-compliant and friendly compared to previous generations, particularly those cells which contain toxic, heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury.CONS:1. My rating on these cells is 4.5 stars due to the perceived steep price points of the Energizer brand that most folks believe. However, if you do the math, as another astute reviewer has, you will find that lithium cells are actually a more cost-effective choice when compared to an equivalent-sized alkaline battery. Nevertheless, you are still likely to pay more for a name brand such as Energizer, in order for the company to recoup their research and development costs.2. Lithium cells may be a safety hazard, particularly when exposed to high temperatures for sustained periods of time. For this reason, the federal government has imposed transport restrictions on lithium batteries. Although these restrictions have recently been relaxed, lithium cells can and do explode because they contain a pressurized, flammable electrolyte. For this reason, it is advisable to store these cells in a temperature-stable environment.3. Energizer currently has several different &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of their &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; Lithium batteries on the retail market. Some packages state &ldquo;up to 4x longer&rdquo; while newer versions announce on the front of the blister card up to 8x or 9x longer in selected devices. Be careful to select the latest available expiration date card(s) to avoid purchasing an earlier version of the product. Each cell also has a production/ lot code embossed on it; however, they are not at present, user-identifiable without assistance from Energizer.BOTTOM LINE:1. These are excellent batteries when used properly and in the correct equipment. In consideration of the longer storage and discharge interval, my recommendation would be to use lithium cells for those appliances and equipment requiring longer replacement intervals such as fire, smoke and CO2 detectors; water sensors, outdoor sensors, digital cameras and remote controls to name just a few.2. Avoid storing these cells in extreme temperatures-cool, dark and dry is recommended for maximum shelf life and safety. Avoid storing lithium cells in the refrigerator or freezer.3. Energizer lithiums are, in my opinion, no better than those manufactured by other reputable companies. As such, price shop. If store (generic) lithiums are available, shop with your wallet. This is an excellent technology but you need to use and store them wisely.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-been-replacing-most-of-devices-batteries-for-lithium">I have been replacing most of devices batteries for lithium &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been replacing most of devices batteries for lithium ion ones as the time comes, and the extra cost is absolutely worth it. Beyond the practicality of the increased lifespan, the weight saving are especially beneficial for equipment I use for camping. i can feel confident that my batteries will not fail me, and to carry spares for the purpose of &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; adds very little additional weight to my gear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hardy-for-maine-winters">Hardy for Maine Winters!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have in our deer cams in ME and they last throughout the winter and beyond. A little pricey but less pricey than lesser batteries. Our cameras require us to go up on a high ladder to replace, and we would not want to do more often with cheaper batteries. Overall a much better value which require much less maintenance!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-cold-temps">Good for Cold Temps</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these to use in a cold environment temperature transmiiter. However, I did not know until I received the temp. monitor that the display isnt subjected to cold temps. The sensors require AA and they have held up at 2 degrees F below 0 for the last few weeks so it seems they&rsquo;ll do the job. Good batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-very-well-for-some-applications">Works very well for some applications</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have some wireless microphone transmitters that &ldquo;eat&rdquo; alkaline cells rather rapidly. The basic problem is that the voltage of alkalines declines gradually as they are discharged, and they still have quite a bit of available energy when the voltage drops from the nominal 1.5V down to 1.37 volts or so&hellip;but our transmitters quit working at about that lower voltage. Thus we&rsquo;re wasting quite a bit of the alkaline&rsquo;s energy. The discharge curve of lithium cells is much &ldquo;flatter&rdquo; so they hold up to 1.4V until they are almost used up, then drop rapidly. They have enough more actual available energy in this application that the much greater price is worth it&ndash;barely. Plus the lowered hassle factor of not having to replace the cells so often is an additional advantage.Beware, though: complain loudly if the vendor who actually supplies them doesn&rsquo;t supply FRESH cells. On one order, the vendor (not the primary one listed in the Amazon page, but one of the alternates) shipped Energizer e2 Lithium cells: same Energizer part number, same UPC code, but clearly old production (Energizer has made significant improvements) and now with much less shelf life remaining. If the Amazon page shows a picture (as this one does) of a package claiming 20 year shelf life, you should get a package that says the same (or better), and your cells should have a date marked on them that&rsquo;s at least 19 years out from today&rsquo;s date. In my case the cells are marked with an &ldquo;expiration&rdquo; only 8 years from now.</p>

<h5 id="great-batteries-for-special-purposes">Great batteries for &ldquo;special&rdquo; purposes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These lithium batteries are great. They are long lasting, lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures. Their &ldquo;BEST BY&rdquo; date is often ten years or more. If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing, then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures. They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries, like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors. If you&rsquo;re wealthy, then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables, but because of the relatively high cost, I only use these for &ldquo;special&rdquo; applications. Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-batteries">Great batteries.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the eight-pack in February, 2015. Four of them were installed in the Kwikset electronic deadbolt on my front door, and have been operating it for over eight months. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;m going to have to change them, they just keep on going. For reference, I was changing alkalines out in that unit every three to four weeks.The gentleman who filed the one-star review because he thought the batteries should last 20 years apparently ignored both the packaging (which states that the 20 years is &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo;, not &ldquo;operating life&rdquo;), and the &ldquo;About the product&rdquo; blurb on the Amazon product page that clearly states &ldquo;Hold power for 20 years when not in use&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
