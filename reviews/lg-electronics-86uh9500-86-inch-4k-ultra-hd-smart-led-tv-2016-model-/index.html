<h5 id="lg-s-best-model-is-not-this-one-but-the">LG&rsquo;s best model is not this one but the&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finally was able to get ahold of the UH9500 where I work so I can test out the best 4K LED from LG. My store for the past several years has always carried the best of Samsung, but never LG besides their OLED. However, a customer did an in store and when it came in they cancelled so I actually got one in stock which the manager let me open and display.So I&rsquo;ll start off by saying this TV is very thin compared to their step below UH8500, but what I wanted to do was test to see if their was any improvements over the UH8500 and is it worth upgrading to the bigger model. The UH9500 is only in two sizes, the 65&rdquo; and 86&rdquo; while the UH8500 comes in 55&rdquo; 60&rdquo; 65&rdquo; and 75&rdquo;. So really, this is only for those who are debating for which 65&rdquo; they should get.The picture quality is almost identical, with the UH8500 giving a little better black level and uniformity. The UH9500 has more noticeable clouding and this is due to it having three IPS screens while the UH8500 only has two.The contrast levels are also the same, both being average and this is once again because of the IPS screens. IPS panels and VA panels each have their own positive and negative qualities. IPS panels give you a much wider viewing area, so for those who have a large living room and seating area would like LG models as they allow people to sit off angle to the TV and still see a great picture. However, due to having multiple screens it requires more light power which causes poor black levels so those who watch movies in the dark may not like it. If LG would do full array local dimming I feel they would have this in the bag. But sadly, TV manufacturers seem to think people want extremely thin TVs so they&rsquo;ve continued the tradition with edge lit local dimming. Which don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Edge Lit Local Dimming is still better than not having it however we all know they could have done better and people would have paid more for that kind of technology in their TV. VA panels, like Samsung offer deeper black levels with a higher contrast level which for people, day or night would appreciate the picture. However, once you start moving off to the side you lose picture quality and the more off to the side the faster it deteriorates. So for large living rooms and wider viewing areas may not like Samsung models.The color depth and banding of the UH9500 is better than the UH8500 but only slightly, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s worth paying more for the 65UH9500 over the 65UH8500 as most wouldn&rsquo;t notice this.The UH8500 has a better 3D picture, I noticed on the UH9500 that there was a little cross talk when test this feature out where the UH8500 I didn&rsquo;t have this issue with and was almost nonexistent.The motion blur on the UH9500 is better than average, however isn&rsquo;t as great as the UH8500 and is actually noticeable worse because when I set these models side by side I could tell see the faint trail behind fast objects.The UH8500 is also better at Judder-Free support. This is another thing that needs to be said as well, and this is a feature that no one ever seems to look at when buying a TV and that&rsquo;s Judder-Free 24p support. Movies play a certain frame rates, Blu Rays and DVD&rsquo;s play at 24fps, streaming movies like from Netflix play at 60p and movies from cable are 60i. This has been a thing that has always been over looked with most people, and that is does that TV support these frame rates. Samsung&rsquo;s 2016 models K6250 all the way through KU7500 doesn&rsquo;t support ANY of these frame rates. This means that regardless of what&rsquo;s playing, there will be a slight judder. It&rsquo;s mostly noticeable with slow panning shots, and to be honest most people don&rsquo;t notice it all. This is one of the reasons why Motion Interpolation is included with LED&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s because with that Soap Opera Effect on, it hides the judder so they could cut corners with internal features. Samsung isn&rsquo;t the only brand that does this, Sony, LG, Vizio and many more do the same thing, and it&rsquo;s annoying and a trend that&rsquo;s slowly starting to change.So the UH8500 supports Judder-Free playback with 24p (Blu Ray and DVD&rsquo;s) and 60i which is cable movies. It doesn&rsquo;t however support 60p which is streaming. I&rsquo;m a little confused by this, as most people would agree that most people stream their content and watch from physical copies of their movies. So I really think if LG wasn&rsquo;t going to support a signal in their models, it would be 60i as most people are slowly cutting cable out of their lives.The UH9500 on the other hand, only supports 24p playback. So movies from cable and streaming will play with a slight judder. I was a little surprised actually that their best model would drop 60i playback. I would have assumed it would either improve over the UH8500 and support all, or be exactly the same. It&rsquo;s possible that in the future they will release an update that will fix this. LG did this in the past with their 2015 OLED to support 60i, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they did the same for this model.The judder isn&rsquo;t really noticeable if you aren&rsquo;t sensitive to it, I am and I can tell you I hate it. You can normally play in the Auto Motion settings, and under custom you can slide the De-Judder bar a little higher and set the De-Blur bar really low and this should hide the judder while not showing the Soap Opera Effect. Lucky for me, I actually don&rsquo;t notice the Soap Opera Effect and like it.The LG UH9500 is a pretty good model, but for those who are looking at getting a 65&rdquo; it&rsquo;s really hard to convince someone in getting the UH9500 when it&rsquo;s little brother the UH8500 offers the same picture, feature and is better at motion and 3D. So if you are debating between these two models, the UH8500 is a much better get, and will save you money which you can use to get a 4K Blu Ray Player and get the most out of your new 4K TV.The Samsung KS8000 will also be an amazing choice and is actually the one I recommend to most people. It offers a much better picture quality, deep black levels and much better peak brightness. The only negative I have is no 3D, and the picture will deteriorate from the side. So if you have a large seating area the UH8500/UH9500 would probably be a better choice. However, I would still strongly consider you to take a look at the KS8000 before you pull the trigger.The Sony X930D, like the KS8000 will also give you a great picture and deeper black levels than the Samsung KS8000. However, like the Samsung it will deteriorate from the side. The Sony X930D also offers 3D but it&rsquo;s not Passive 3D but active so it&rsquo;s a different technology and can&rsquo;t compete with LG in this department.The LG B6 OLED is different in technology, much different and is a million times better in every way. This fetches a higher price tag than what some wanted to spend, however its black levels is amazing, contrast is amazing and HDR performance is improved as well as motion. If you have the money, and want the very best picture then OLED is where it&rsquo;s at.</p>

<h5 id="pleased-with-the-purchase">Pleased with the purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this set because of its 10 bit display and ability to accept both HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR formats. The set produces a great picture with currently available HD signals and does a decent job upscaling non HD signals. The smart platform is very good and coupled with the magic remote is easy to use. The more familiar I become with this set and adjustments, the more pleased I am with the purchase. I struggled with the decision to spend several hundred dollars more for this set than its cousin, the 65UH8500, which has an 8 bit display but is otherwise technically equal. Additionally, I preferred the style of the 65UH9500.</p>

<p>Great picture, great style and the Magic remote. All the built in apps and passive 3D. Everything works as it should.2016 models were the last of the 3D sets, at least for now. Passive 3D models were made by LG and VIZIO.You will have to hunt to find one.</p>

<h5 id="getting-it-for-a-deal-i-don-t-feel-so-bad-about-the-purchase">Getting it for a deal, I don&rsquo;t feel so bad about the purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this from one of Amazon&rsquo;s 3rd party sellers for 3600.00 less than most other 10k listings. Had I purchased this for 10k, I honestly think I would return it and wait for OLED to come down in price for larger sets.CONS First: Having come from a six year old Panasonic 65&rdquo; Plasma the way this LCD deals with darkening the screen is disappointing. Turning off the side lighting definitely helps with the black being blacker, but on an all black screen with a single white logo for example the logo will be ghosted with a very visible grey that matches the width of the logo from the top of the screen to the bottom. So if you are using the remotes mouse on a black screen there&rsquo;s a band of grey from top to bottom that follows its location. During full screen content (movies/TV) this is much less noticeable but it is noticeable whenever there are large portions of black that are on screen (think a space scene with a large white spaceship). On a scale of 1-100 I&rsquo;d take off 15 points for this having come from a Plasma, and not being able to afford $20k for the largest OLED (which is still 11 inches diagonal smaller than this TV). It&rsquo;s distracting.The other big issue is 3D. I know the industry is trying to kill it, but I still enjoy it and want it for my TV which is part of why I got this one. The 3D for this TV is passive, which actually seems like an upgrade from the Panasonic&rsquo;s Shutter Glasses since they have a larger lens to look through and are significantly cheaper. The First World Problem is that the TV is SO large that sitting on my 24&rdquo; high TV Stand the seating position is way too low. The result is that the entire upper portion of the TV doubles up a ghost image (mostly visible on high contrast things like a light in a dark room). I tested this and it 100% goes away by standing up and being at the right height. So I can&rsquo;t fault the TV for this and it can be solved but be aware if you purchase this TV you&rsquo;ll need a lower stand or higher seating to have the height of your eyes be pretty close to the halfway point on the screen and see 3D correctly.The PROS: It&rsquo;s a 4k monster of gloriousness. The picture is amazing, I dealt with the &ldquo;Soap Opera&rdquo; effect to satisfaction, and the Smart TV features are great. Getting into Netflix and Amazon to watch movies is extremely fast compared the Playstation 3 I had been using. Having a Web browser You Tube and XM right on the TV is great. I also have this hooked up to my VR Computer and the screen is amazing in 4k. I also downloaded the Plex app on the TV and installed the server software on the VR computer and ripped a test movie to it and it all works flawlessly. The only down on this was that unlike playing the movie through HDMI from my OPPO player the TV doesn&rsquo;t seem to upconvert movies played through Plex so moving all my DVD&rsquo;s to a media server will sacrifice picture quality.There&rsquo;s a lot more of the pluses in terms of features, too many to mention but suffice it to say that all these Pro&rsquo;s outweighed the main CON on the contrast&hellip;. at the price point I got it at.</p>

<p>Technology at its best. Very nice picture. Looks like a opening in our great room wall that leads into an alternate reality. Still new to us but thus far we love it. Mostly use Firestick as everything is now going online with Direct TV Now and Cox online. Samsung has its own interface built in but if I use Firestick I can tie the whole thing in with Alexa. That means I can play music from Alexa through our massive sound system and talk to Alexa on the TV. Pretty cool. No more need to record anything anymore. Cant wait to try the 3D feature.</p>
