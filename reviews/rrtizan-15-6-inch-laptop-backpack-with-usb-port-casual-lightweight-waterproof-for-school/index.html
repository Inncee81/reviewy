<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="nice-look-and-material">Nice look and material</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got a USB cable with this backpack which was important because it has the female connect which you need to plug your devices into. The material seems to be strong and matches a sports/travel bag which is why I bought this. It looks good. My MacBook Pro 15&rdquo; fits snug on the inside. There is an outside centered pocket which is perfect to one (maybe two) external hard drives. The large outside pocket is great for separating all my cables for my computer power and hard drives. There are two water bottle holders, one on each side that I probably won&rsquo;t use but it&rsquo;s nice to have the option so you&rsquo;re not having to toss it inside with your electronics. The reason I gave this 4 stars is that I wish it had a little more padding and was double stitched everywhere instead of just some spots to make sure it&rsquo;s extra secure on the seams.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="use-for-drone">Use for drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted something lightweight to use for outdoor trips and this fits my needs perfectly. The fabric is nice and light and the bag feels comfortable enough to wear it all day. I&rsquo;m going to use it to carry my tablet and my compact drone. I can use the usb along with a power bank to charge my drone batteries or tablet and the bag holds my water bottle nicely. There is enough storage to hold everything I need while exploring. It feels like it will hold up and I&rsquo;m pretty happy with this bag.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The backpack is made of strong material. It&rsquo;s good for daily use at school but not for heavy use. The pockets are enough to put your stuffs inside and not complicated or overdesigned. There&rsquo;s a small USB port on the side for you to connect with the power bank in the pocket. You can charge the phone without many wires aroind you or leave it in the backpack. It would be a plus if there were a small pocket on the strap to keep your phone like Asus one.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-backpack-is-really-very-good-i-can-take-my-laptop-my-tablet-without-fear">this backpack is really very good I can take my laptop my tablet without fear &hellip;</h5>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">DISAPPOINTED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was not what I expected. The USB is merely a cord so unless you have a portable charger you have no use for it. The zipper on my backpack has split its too late to return it plus I put an iron on patch on the front so I am stuck with it. I will not be purchasing this item again. Save your money or spend extra money to get something else.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-bag-for-laptop">Good Bag for Laptop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really loved this bad, as there is the usb cable output on this, and it good for the laptop. Everything seems comfortable while i m carrying this bag for my laptop. And you can also find two small pocket inside which is good to hide something. The slang strip on the bag is another good point for this bag to adjust the bag.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-backpack-bad-charging-cable">Nice backpack,bad charging cable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Backpack has a good build, could use some pockets or cable management on the straps. Nice pockets for the battery bank, but the supplied cable is very slow. Estimated time to charge my phone from 50% to full is 8 hours. If direct connect to the battery bank it would only take 1 hour.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-backpack">I love this backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This purchase was better than I could have imagined! I was looking for a tech bag with a ton of pockets and storage space for all my gear, including my laptop, iPad and charging cables. This is a very affordable option. I received the product in perfect condition and it was delivered to me a few short days after I placed my order. I’m more than pleased with the service and the product! I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a durable, comfortable, space-worthy bag (especially perfect for college students).READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-quality">Wonderful quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This bag is great! Perfect size good quality!!! Love having the ability to charge my phone in a pinch!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bag itself is good; however, the zipper is poor quality. The zipper broke 2 month after purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cable doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-back-pack">Nice back pack!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks nice and fits my laptop well. Good looking back pack. It could use a little thicker padding on the back but worth it for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-son-loves-the-backpack-but-it-s-not-very-good-quality-we-could-never-get-the-side-straps">I son loves the backpack but it&rsquo;s not very good quality. We could never get the side straps &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I son loves the backpack but it&rsquo;s not very good quality. We could never get the side straps connected and the zip split after only a few week&rsquo;s use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Also works great for 13 in laptops haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My backpack just broken few days ago, and I ordered this backpack for my school use. When iPhone’s battery is easy to die, the function of charging the phone is very convenient&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-work">Perfect for work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great backpack. I was worried it might not fit my laptop (15in) but there is more than enough room for that, extra cords and accessories, and my purse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="she-loves-it">SHE LOVES IT.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>GREAT</p>
