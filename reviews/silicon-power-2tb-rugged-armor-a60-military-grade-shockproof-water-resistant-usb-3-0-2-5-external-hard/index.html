<h5 id="connection-problems-after-a-month-or-so-twice">Connection problems after a month or so (twice).</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this drive to replace a WD drive that stopped working after dropping it. At first this drive was great and fast. Then after about 2 months it started having connection problems, and would only connect at USB2 speeds. Then after another month, my computer wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize that it was connected. The drives have been protected and have never been dropped or abused. My wife bought another one before the first drive started having these problems, and now it is starting to do the exact same thing. There are several other reviewers who have had similar connection problems with their drives. I would avoid buying these drives. I&rsquo;m returning the newer one for refund, sending the first one back to Silicon Power under and RMA, and buying another brand.</p>

<h5 id="massive-storage-space-and-great-durability-excellent-x-drive-for-travel">MASSIVE STORAGE SPACE AND GREAT DURABILITY! EXCELLENT X-DRIVE FOR TRAVEL!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome! Massive storage and super durable! Thank you! My only issue I have is that for some reason my tablet, 1st generation Surface RT, does not like communicating with this x-drive&hellip; must be that it&rsquo;s too advanced for my old tablet (it&rsquo;s sad to say an electronic is old when it&rsquo;s only 3 years old, but nowadays electronics are old in less than 6 mos. when the new item comes out). SO ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS FROM ME ABOUT THE STORAGE OR DURABILITY OF THIS UNIT. This is great for travel, cuz you can&rsquo;t always trust your stuff to properly back up to your cloud from your phone or your camera even if it is set up to do so, cuz most internet abroad is miserably slow&hellip;. I say this after coming off of 2 years of travel to 6 continents and 16 countries and over 130 cities. And sadly, 2 days after I returned I was mugged at knife point and my phone was stolen and possibly a huge chunk of my pics/videos are lost cuz the phone was having major issues backing up to the cloud cuz of connectivity issues every day (I tried both Drop Box and One Cloud to no real avail, just pics pushed through occasionally but the videos didn&rsquo;t want to) so having an x-drive with you to back up to at the end of the day, is well worth it! Just make sure you have a tablet or laptop that isn&rsquo;t a dinosaur and can properly back up to the xdrive (before you leave home).</p>

<h5 id="excellent-drive">Excellent Drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As film students at Montana State University, we are required to have at least one external hard drive that holds 1TB worth of data. This drive has never let me down. I have dropped it, thrown my bag with it in it, used it on both PC and Mac laptops and desktops, and still have about 1TB or more left. Worth the buy if you&rsquo;re in need of one of these.Repent and believe in the Gospel, for it is the power to save for those that believe.</p>

<h5 id="top-notch-transportable-hard-drive">Top notch transportable hard drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super durable, easy plug and play, and fast. This is a great little external hard drive. The USB wraps around and hooks into the rubber sides of the drive for easy transportation. I haven&rsquo;t tried dropping it, but with the way it feels, I&rsquo;m pretty confident that they&rsquo;re not lying when they tell you it&rsquo;s very difficult to damage. A lot of things say military grade, this actually feels like it. I&rsquo;d recommend this over the similarly priced Western Digital Passports.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-drive-stable-durable-and-very-convenient">Great drive, stable, durable, and very convenient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Removing a star for the useless clips for the USB cable, AND the non-standard plug. (male to male USB, but I like that it is more sturdy than a micro connection, so I can see why they did it.) It just makes it tricky if you lose it. I work in IT and carry nearly every common cable , but male to male USB 3.0 (or 2.0) is not very common. I probably would have been fine if they hard wired one end onto the device which would help the clip feature work better too.Great drive, stable, durable, and very convenient otherwise. It has a nice quality feel to it, especially when compared to WD Passports.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mediocre-at-best">Mediocre at Best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product came highly reviewed and I was excited for both the large storage size as well as the shockproof and water-resistant qualities. What I have received was mediocre at best. The drive constantly disconnects at the slightest pull and other times fails to dock completely. Spending over $100 I did not think that I would be using a product of this poor quality. If you have future models of this product please look into these complaints. Do not buy this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-drive">Great Little Drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased the drive for backing up multimedia files at work. I got the 2 TB A60 drive and appreciate the military specs as I will be taking it with me everywhere in my work bag and having it protected against shocks will be useful. The drive is solidly built with rubber around all sides and a small rubber flap covering the usb 3.0 port. It comes with a USB 3.0 male to male cable with a full size connector on each side. I don&rsquo;t plan on losing the cable but it can be difficult to locate this type of cable as they are not the ones routinely (found mini connector on one side and full size on the other).The drive came formatted with FAT 32 and since I work with both PCs and Macs I formatted it for exFAT which provides good compatibility with both PC and Macs, you will have an issue with Linux with this format unfortunately. The plus side is that you can use files larger than 4 GB (limitation of FAT32) with native support on both Mac and Windows. Note that if you are want to use the drive as a TimeMachine backup you must format it to HFS+ (there are work arounds for that but I wouldn&rsquo;t trust my data to a work around). If you format as HFS+ you will not be able to read or write on Windows without installing other drivers.After formatting it I tested it with the BlackMagic Disk Speed Test on my Macbook Pro Retina (mid 2014) 13.3&rdquo;, 8GB, 2.6 GHz and it averaged between 100 and 110 MB for both read and writes. I then tested it on XBench and got the following results:SequentialUncached Write 96.43 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Write 95.05 MB/sec [256K blocks]Uncached Read 22.53 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Read 111.01 MB/sec [256K blocks]RandomUncached Write 0.28 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Write 12.80 MB/sec [256K blocks]Uncached Read 0.48 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Read 25.31 MB/sec [256K blocks]Very good results and about what I would expect from a USB 3.0 Drive. It isn;t the fastest drive available but these numbers put it in the top quartile for 2.5&rdquo; portable USB 3.0 drives. Overall I am very happy with the drive</p>
