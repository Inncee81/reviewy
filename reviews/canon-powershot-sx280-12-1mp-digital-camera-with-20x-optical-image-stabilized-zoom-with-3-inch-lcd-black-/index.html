<p>Capture The World as You See It</p>

<p>Powerful 20x Optical Zoom with 25mm Wide-Angle Lens
The PowerShot SX280 HS features a powerful 20x Optical Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. It does not have rear facing
picture capability.The camera&rsquo;s lens embodies the quality and legacy of Genuine Canon Optics with advantages that go far beyond making the camera slim enough to slip in your pocket and carry anywhere. With a range of 25–500mm (35mm equivalent), the lens gives you the power to capture the full breadth of scenes, with details you&rsquo;ve never captured before. Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization.</p>

<p>Optical Image Stabilizer
Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.</p>

<p>Beautiful Images and Fast Performance Start Here
12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor
The PowerShot SX280 HS employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.</p>

<p>Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor
The PowerShot SX280 HS is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s very latest proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor makes several important advancements, including improved sensitivity that allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions. Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that&rsquo;s exceptionally free of distortion. In addition, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables video recording in MP4 format. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM for exceptional low-light performance up to ISO 6400
The PowerShot SX280 HS gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon&rsquo;s latest-generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you&rsquo;ll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400; beautiful low-light shots are possible with maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and videos.</p>

<p>Full HD Video That&rsquo;s Better Than Ever</p>

<p>1080p/60p Full HD video
With the camera&rsquo;s advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor enabling MP4 format recording, the PowerShot SX280 HS lets you shoot video at a selectable frame rate of 60 fps or 30 fps. 1080p/60p Full HD video is extraordinarily smooth and rich in playback, ensuring that your important memories and creative film clips look their absolute best. Video recorded at 30 fps has also been improved through the combination of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor and Fine Movie Detail Processing, with reduced noise and high resolution.</p>

<p>A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos
Smart AUTO
Smart AUTO for the PowerShot SX280 HS has been significantly expanded, making it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images – and videos – you&rsquo;re looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX280 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.</p>

<p>Face ID
Face ID on the PowerShot SX280 HS gives you an easy way to improve every shot of the people you love. Simply take a picture of up to 12 faces you would like the camera to register, then enter names and ages. Once a person is registered, the camera will pick him or her out of a group (even against a busy background) and adjust focus and exposure to his or her face, even recognizing faces in profile. Face ID is particularly great for shots of babies and children. The system can pick your baby out of a group of children, focus on your baby when pictured with an adult, and capture the best smile by taking three successive images when the smile is detected. The flash is even disabled so as not to startle the baby and interrupt the moment. Older children in motion are tracked, with focus and exposure continually adjusted with Servo AF; with one shutter press three successive images are captured so the best shot is never missed. And because you&rsquo;ll identify each face you register, Face ID makes it easy to search images by name.</p>

<p>Remember the Day in Crisp HD
New Hybrid Auto utilizes a combination of Smart AUTO and Intelligent IS to create a beautiful and steady 720p HD video clip in Movie Digest mode every time you shoot a still image
New Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot SX280 HS brings enhanced image quality to the popular Movie Digest feature on PowerShot digital cameras. Movie Digest records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, any time you&rsquo;re shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this &ldquo;highlight reel&rdquo; is more beautiful than ever. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.</p>

<p>Optimal Image Stabilization in Any Situation
Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX280 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.</p>

<p>Normal  Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid)  Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
The Ideal Traveling Companion

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-camera-love-the-wireless">Great Camera! Love the Wireless!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a number of PowerShot cameras. Really impressed with the picture quality of the camera and the overall speed. Colors and picture quality are quite good and the low-light performance is superior. The previous review focuses nicely on the picture quality, so I wil stick with the human factors.Manual control and adjustment are simple to master, so you won&rsquo;t need to rely on the automatic settings. My only concern with the camera is hat the wifi settings are difficult to set up. I&rsquo;m pretty good with wireless technologies and it took me quite awhile to figure it out. Make sure you run the set up disk. Unlike many other consumer wireless gadgets, this one requires that you run the setup software. Couldn&rsquo;t just turn on the camera and connect it to the router. As much as it pains me to say this, I should&rsquo;ve read the directions prior to jumping in to try to set it up! :-)Once it&rsquo;s setup, it works great. I&rsquo;ve been transferring files to iphone, ipad, and laptop; and transferring to the Canon Image site. All directly from the camera. Even emailed my wife a link to a photo directly from the camera. Camera IS a bit of a battery hog, but I was expecting it.Update: Since I concentrated on human factors in my review, I thought I would weigh in on flash location interfering with handholdposition. Personally, I didn&rsquo;t notice it until I read the other reviews. I&rsquo;ve had other cameras with pop up flashes, so I think I just automatically adjusted to it. That said, I can see how it would annoy some people. The flash is located in the front left-hand corner of the camera, but there IS sufficient space behind the flash to place your finger. Could be a problem if you have large hands, I suppose.. Motor is also strong enough to remind me to move it when it pops up.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Update 20 May:: There is a glitch that&rsquo;s been widely reported that shows that the battery is drained when in video mode. This is a glitch in the indicator, not the actual battery life. Cannon has acknowledged the problem and is working on a fix. Expect the next firmware update to address the issue.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Update 5 June: New Firmware Released Today!! Details Firmware Version 1.0.2.0 incorporates the following fixes and improvements:1. Increases the duration of movie shooting by 20% in cases where the optical zoom is used compared to cameras running Firmware Version 1.0.0.0 or Firmware Version 1.0.1.0 through a reduction in the power consumption of the optical zoom.*Time under default camera settings, when normal operations are performed, such as shooting, pausing, turning the camera on and off, and zooming. (based on conditions established by Canon).-Under some shooting conditions, the recording time may be shorter than mentioned above.-Recording time with a fully charged battery.2. Fixes a phenomenon with cameras running firmware version 1.0.0.0, in which the low battery level warning is prematurely displayed while shooting in movie mode.Firmware Version 1.0.2.0 is for cameras with firmware Version 1.0.1.0 or Version 1.0.0.0. If the camera&rsquo;s firmware is already Version 1.0.2.0, it is not necessary to update the firmware. Please note that, once the camera is updated to the latest version, it cannot be restored to a previousI installed it with no problems.</p>

<p>Hi thereI&rsquo;ve replied to a few reviews of this product before choosing to write my own, while keeping in mind everyone&rsquo;s opinions (especially about the battery) thus far.Out of the way, I too noticed &ldquo;problems&rdquo; when shooting video on a not-fully charged battery. I put the word in quotes, because in my experience/view, it&rsquo;s really a software problem that can be fixed with an upcoming firmware update. It just flashes red prematurely, and you can certainly repeat steps to have that happen consistently. Also, you&rsquo;ll only get about 30 minutes or so of 1920/60fps HD video per charge (keep in mind the battery will likely be flashing red most of the time). But keep in mind, its really just a bug. When you power up your camera, the true charge is shown on the indicator.I took the camera with me today to shoot a typical days worth of exciting things with my kids. I took about 35 photos, and a combined 7 minutes of full HD/1920/60fps video. I also transferred a few images wirelessly to my Android phone. After all that, my battery is still showing as fully charged and does not do the &lsquo;premature red battery&rsquo; even if i take it to video. So that seems like a decent day for me, and it doesn&rsquo;t show a dent (and rightly so). I&rsquo;ll just have to remember to charge the battery fully before I take it out.In the end, I do recommend the camera because of what I bought it for: excellent, truly best-in-class images from a camera under $400. This camera is my &lsquo;2nd&rsquo; camera, for times when I don&rsquo;t feel like dragging my DSLR around. The images aren&rsquo;t as good as a DSLR (no surprise) but they are by far the best images I&rsquo;ve taken with a point-and-shoot. The 20x optical zoom is truly incredible, and the true/natural Image Stabilization (<em>not</em> digital) is fantastic: you can actually take a 20x zoomed picture without it being blurry! Not only that, the IS during video shooting makes it smooth-as-silk on playback, especially in truly stunning 60fps mode. Shutter-lag isn&rsquo;t as good as a DSLR (because the concept doesnt exist with mirrors), but it&rsquo;s miles ahead of my last 2011 P&amp;S and also faster than my 2013 smartphone camera.I can see why the video/battery issue is so frustrating: the video from this thing is truly amazing (stereo, Image Stabilization, and did I mention 1920 and 60fps yet??!) and you <em>want</em> to shoot a ton with it. It&rsquo;s also in ultra-convenient mp4 format right out-of-the-camera. And it does a superb job of focusing as you zoom on video (my older p&amp;s wouldn&rsquo;t let me zoom in video mode at all). But if video is really your mojo, get a camcorder for the same price and be happy. If you&rsquo;re after stills, or shooting video &ldquo;shorts&rdquo;, this is your bet. And hopefully the short-ish battery on video will make better videographers out of people by forcing them to cut down on the extra crap they shoot that nobody watches anyways :)Touching on a few remaining things: I love that the camera has a metal body, love its hefty weight (remember when cameras felt like cameras and not TV remotes?) and dig the wireless. I&rsquo;m not a GPS guy because the privacy issue freaks me out, so I don&rsquo;t run the GPS. As mentioned by other reviewers, the wireless is a bit tricky to set up if you want to go camera-&gt;computer wirelessly - you&rsquo;ll have to run the software on the CD (it retrieves the latest version from the net automatically). The easiest set-up is camera-&gt;smartphone; as long as they&rsquo;re on the same network, transfers are easy. If there&rsquo;s no wireless where you&rsquo;re shooting, you can actually use the camera as an access point itself and connect your smartphone/tablet to the <em>camera&rsquo;s</em> network. Keep in mind that the wireless transfer is <em>not</em> eye-fi: you have to <em>select</em> the images you want to send, after they&rsquo;ve been shot (photos aren&rsquo;t automatically transferred wirelessly as you shoot). Believe it or not, you can actually tweet from the camera itself. That being said, I think the omission of Flickr is a drag, but perhaps that&rsquo;s because they are pushing their own &ldquo;Canon Image Gateway&rdquo; service for photo sharing/storage.Also, I appreciate the restraint in megapixels&hellip; the filesizes and document sizes are realistic and appropriate for people who aren&rsquo;t blowing photos up to large dimensions. Focusing on image quality instead of megapixel count is a much welcomed approach in my opinion, and I hope the ridiculous megapixel race slows down in order to focus on the sensor quality/lenses that can be crammed into a P&amp;S size camera.Also, coming from DSLR world, I&rsquo;m actually pretty happy with the amount of customization offered. The manual (on the CD only) is chock full of information, including how to use the self-timer in &ldquo;wink&rdquo; mode (wink to take the shot!!). All modes I shoot on (M/AV/TV/P) offer <em>center only</em> focus. I haven&rsquo;t seen that mentioned too often, but that is <em>exactly</em> what I like - in fact the first thing I do on my DSLRs/new cameras is turn off the &lsquo;smart autofocus&rsquo; to use center-point only). It means you might have to take a moment to frame the shot you want (focus then frame), but to me it cuts down on silly camera &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; errors when it focuses on things with contrast instead of the content that matters.I don&rsquo;t find the position of the pop-up flash an issue; my finger fits behind it. Also, consider that the pop-up flash reduces red-eye quite significantly by being further away from the lens. Not only that, but this camera is <em>great</em> in low-light for a point-and-shoot - ease up on the flash and enjoy the great new processor!This camera does exactly what I want it to do, and does it <em>really well</em>, but if I was planning on a day of really heavy shooting with video, I&rsquo;d buy a spare battery. And I&rsquo;m looking forward to a firmware update!</p>

<h5 id="battery-issue-still-exists">BATTERY ISSUE STILL EXISTS!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this only a week and I am returning it and replacing it with a Canon SX260 HS. I took the camera to Disney and went through 3 batteries and could only get 15 minutes max of video time on a fresh battery. Still images were not a problem. According to the Canon website if the camera has the sixth digit of 3 or higher in the serial number, the camera should not have the battery issue. I did the Firmware update prior to using the camera. The camera said the firmware was up to date and the Serial number is 3 in the sixth digit. From my recent experience the battery issue with this camera is not corrected. As soon as I zoomed the battery indicator went from full to red empty.I will say the the 1080p video that I was able to get is excellent when I viewed it on my 55&rdquo; TV and the stills are great along with the long zoom it is in function a great camera. But the battery problem ruins the entire package. This is why I am moving to the Canon SX260HS. No battery problem. And the SX260 HS has the same zoom and other features but no Wi-Fi, which is no loss to me as.I have owned Canon cameras for 40+ years and am very disappointed that that Canon allowed a major flaw in a camera into the market. I have read reviews recently that there is an opinion that it is a hardware conflict problem not truly a software issue (I do not know this to be a fact). If it is truly a hardware conflict no amount of firmware updates will correct the battery problem.In conclusion, buy the Canon SX260 HS not the SX280 HS.</p>
