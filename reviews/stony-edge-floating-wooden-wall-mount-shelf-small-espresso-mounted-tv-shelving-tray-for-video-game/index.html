<h5 id="the-shelf-of-your-dreams">The Shelf of your dreams.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Man I love this unit. Got it for above my kids gaming tv and was worried it would be flimsy. NOPE not at all. Sturdy and heavy wood but comes with a setup to mount that is super easy to put up. Speaking of easy it took me all of 5 min to build and 8 min to put up. See photos. Plus it comes with a level which is awesome too. If you want a fast easy fix for mounting your vid games, Kodi box or DVD player. This is it !!! The finish is top notch and definitely not cheaply made.the instructions are great too !!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-small-shelf-answers-what-the-tiny-home-needs">A Small Shelf Answers What the Tiny Home Needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very solid, well built, and easy to hang on a wall. I looked all over for a decent piece of furniture that was small enough to hang on a backwall in the bedroom area of our trailer. They had the hook-ups in the wall that was the other side of the living room area with the entertainment equipment and the larger TV. That wall had pocket doors and made it quite difficult to get something that could be attached to the support 1x4 slats in the wall and make a platform for a smaller TV and an extra shelf. The floating shelf design that could support 25# on each shelf made it the winning answer.This could easily hang on a wall next to a bed or a living room chair. We are in the age of Tiny Houses and we have down-sized after selling our house and then bought a smaller RV trailer instead of our larger Motorhome, so condensing everything everywhere, had to look for small answers.</p>

<h5 id="and-with-smaller-components-this-is-an-amazing-set-it-is-a-two-screw-four-peg">and with smaller components this is an amazing set. It is a two screw four peg &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am giving this 5 stars even though there is room for improvement, let me explain why. This is by far the easiest set up I have ever done, and with smaller components this is an amazing set. It is a two screw four peg set up that legitimately holds my original Xbox One and my Directv original Genie. However, I wish they offered a larger size, the components just barely hold over the edge, still secure, but a bigger shelf would make for a cleaner look. Overall, still a 5 star product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-directions-high-quality-materials">Great directions &amp; high quality materials</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The directions were very easy to follow and much easier to put up than what I anticipated. Seriously, it took less than five minutes. It is high quality, packaged well, and looks great on our wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am really happy with the shelf and will probably purchase another one. I was looking for something on the smaller side for a nightstand. This works out perfectly for me because I can choose the height that works for me, and I can put my dogs bed underneath of it. I can fit everything I need on it including a small lamp, a clock and my Kindle with room for more. It is well made and easy to put together and hang.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-floating-shelf">Perfect floating shelf!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these floating shelves for my living room to out under my 47&rdquo; tv I wanted a clean simple look and this is exactly that! The color is a beautiful express color, and the size is perfect to hold my cable box and blue ray player. I love it, and it was easy to put together and hang, I did it by myself in just a little while! I highly recommend these shelves you will love them too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-and-short-directions">simple and short directions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>easy peasy to put together and looks good on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-good-but-could-hide-cables-better">Looks good but could hide cables better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mounting holes are recessed a bit too far which makes it a bit annoying to fish for the holes while mounting it. The cutouts to hide cables are also more shallow than preferred, and it doesn&rsquo;t hide cables as well as I had hoped.Other than that, it feels relatively strong and looks good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks great, holds everything we need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to assemble and attach to wall. Excellent quality solid wood with a nice finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beautiful and Beverly nice quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-was-too-easy-to-assemble-and-the-final-product-is-aesthetically-pleasing">It was too easy to assemble and the final product is aesthetically pleasing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding console! It was too easy to assemble and the final product is aesthetically pleasing! It was exactly as described and is a solid piece.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shelves are very nice and sturdy. The cherry finish looks very well.</p>
