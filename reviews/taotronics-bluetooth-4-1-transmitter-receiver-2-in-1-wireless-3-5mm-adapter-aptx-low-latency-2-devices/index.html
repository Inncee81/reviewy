<h5 id="non-bluetooth-samsung-tv-can-now-hear-bluetooth-headphones">Non-Bluetooth SAMSUNG TV Can Now Hear Bluetooth Headphones!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first, I didn&rsquo;t think it would work on a 5300 Series Samsung we have above our treadmill. However, I plugged it into the audio out jack of the tv. I went into the menu of the TV and switched the sound from tv speakers to external speakers and restarted the TV. Then got my BT headphones and cleared any old pairing I had done to them (although you may not need to if you haven&rsquo;t paired with anything before) I turned the adapter on and gave 2 quick taps to start pairing mode on the adapter, then got the headphones and started pairing on them. Both sets of devices had alternating red/blue lights, after about 7 seconds, both lights became solid blue and the headphones were paired. NOTE: The headphones usually say &ldquo;you are now connected&rdquo; when paired with other devices. Using the adapter, the only indication the pairing has taken place is the solid blue light on each device (and of course the sound out of the headphones!) Hopes this helps someone who is as electronically challenged as I am!</p>

<h5 id="tiny-weighs-almost-nothing-works-very-well">Tiny, weighs almost nothing, works very well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to use with the TaoTronics Bluetooth sweatproof headphones/earbuds. My Samsung TV does not have a headphone jack but I was able to connect the transmitted to the Audio Out RCA jacks (red and white). I&rsquo;m shocked by how tiny and lightweight the transmitter is! It&rsquo;s smaller and lighter than the small boxes of matches you can get at restaurants. I&rsquo;m letting it dangle from my TV because it&rsquo;s so light. Also I was able to use a different mini USB charger (one that came with a Chromecast stick) so I can keep it plugged into the outlet near my TV and never have to worry about recharging it.I use this transmitter plus the headphones to listen to my TV while using my rowing machine. The rower is pretty loud and I can&rsquo;t simply turn up the TV volume because I work out early in the morning while my spouse is sleeping (our bedroom is directly above our home gym). Before I purchased this transmitter, I was basically stuck using closed captions (fine for shows like The Walking Dead, where there&rsquo;s surprisingly little dialog, not great for the NFL Network or ESPN, where the closed captions are often incorrect and lag far behind).If you&rsquo;re having trouble getting this to pair in TX mode, here&rsquo;s what worked for me: (1) Put the transmitter in TX mode. (2) Put the transmitter into pairing mode (hold down the power button to turn it on, then double-tap so it starts flashing red and blue). (3) Put your other device into pairing mode and hold it close to - but not touching - the transmitter. They should pair up very quickly. (If you&rsquo;re using the TaoTronics headphones, note that you need to hold down the multipurpose button for at least 8 seconds to get the headphones into pairing mode. The instruction booklet says 5 seconds but that is incorrect.)Customer service has been excellent. I had trouble pairing the transmitter with my headphones and customer service was very responsive.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-upgraded-my-bose-headphones-to-wireless">Works great: upgraded my Bose headphones to wireless.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TaoTronics Bluetooth receiver / transmitterThis an awesome gadget. I upgraded my Bose noise cancelling headphones to wireless by attaching this set on rx (receiver) mode to the left earpiece with a piece of hook and loop tape. It is so small and lightweight it isn&rsquo;t even noticeable when wearing them. Now I can watch movies on my tablet wire-free, and still have Bose sound. It does require that the connection to the almost-proprietary headphone jack be seated just-so in order to get stereo but once it is, it stays that way and the sound is great. I blame the headphones for the delicacy of the connection, not this thing.I also use it to play my older iPod on tx (transmitter) mode through a Bluetooth speaker. Love this gadget. I am tempted to get a second one to play the iPod through the headphones, but haven&rsquo;t yet. It should work though.Update: I did finally get a second one (I thought I lost the first, replaced it and then found it again). They will NOT pair to each other as hoped. Dang it.</p>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered the Tao Tronics Bluetooth Transmitter/Receiver. It arrived with a well written instruction book, USB charging cable, RCA male to 3.5 mm male cable, and a 3.5 mm male to 3.5 mm male cable. Item looks well made with the power button on the side of the unit.The red and blue LED lights surround the power button and are easy to see. I bought the unit primarily to transmit audio from my TV and have not tried the receiving function of the unit as yet. I connected the unit to my Vizio TV using the supplied RCA cable. The unit is light enough that I just let it hang behind my TV, but if need be, the unit could be attached to the side or top of the TV with some 2-sided tape. I plugged the charging cable into an open USB port on my TV so it will stay charged. I let the unit charge 2+ hours before attempting any pairing. Pairing was simple and quick. I currently have it paired with an Auvio brand wireless Headphone that list having Bluetooth version 4.0. The Tao Tronics unit lists having version 4.1 and something called A2DP stereo (software ?). I&rsquo;m not sure about the A2DP, but Tao Tronics requires it for whatever device your using when using it for music. As far as working with my TV to transmit audio to my headphones, it works great. There is no lag in audio that I can perceive and the modulation is strong. I recommend this to anyone that wants to watch TV and not disturb the wife (or husband) at night.</p>

<h5 id="good-but-might-have-issues">Good but might have issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it however it does not reconnect to my 808 speaker. It does work perfectly with a cheaper speaker and the 808 works perfectly with other Bluetooth transmitters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="makes-things-wireless-for-the-switch-but-there-s-a-problem">Makes things wireless for the switch! But there&rsquo;s a problem.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So this product is a must buy for Switch owners,however I hate how the audio lags behind ever so slightly.</p>
