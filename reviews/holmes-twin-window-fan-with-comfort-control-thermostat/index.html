<h5 id="nearly-perfect">Nearly perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have given 4.5 stars if possible.I initially bought a different Holmes model but returned it because it made a clicking noise on low speeds and had super annoying LED lights. Who wants these in a bedroom at night?Pros of this model:1. No LED Lights. Controls are easy to use2. You can shut one fan to OFF while the other is ON. This wasn&rsquo;t true of other models.3. Very quiet, considering it is actually a fan4. Seems sturdy, like it could last a long time5. Secures easily in windowCons1. The only con is a dumb design flaw. The pull latches that secure and release the sizer that slides horizontally into the right side of the window are located on the top side and bottom side of the unit. But the bottom side is resting securely on the window sill. So it&rsquo;s impossible to get your fingers under it to snap the bottom latch back into place. Not a deal breaker by any means, but annoying.</p>

<h5 id="i-hate-beeping-appliances">I hate beeping appliances</h5>

<p>When shopping for a window fan I set a budget of $100 or less. I wanted one that would last the longest and move the most air with the least noise possible. Long-lasting meant mechanical controls (not digital push buttons or remote controls) and air movement without noise meant the biggest blades possible. I shopped a lot and decided this was the one for me, and at a lot less than I expected to have to pay. I have the fan plugged into a Clapper outlet control (that&rsquo;s about 20 years old and works perfectly) so I can turn it on/off from bed if I want without a remote dying or getting lost or consuming expensive batteries. The Clapper Sound Activated On/Off Switch, 1 Each I&rsquo;ve had this fan about a month now and I have no complaints. It makes as little fan/air noise as I think it reasonably can (and doesn&rsquo;t beep, I hate beeping appliances!) and moves as much air as I would expect for its size. It&rsquo;s weaker than a 20&rdquo; box fan in terms of total airflow, but 2 x 8&rdquo; fans = 16&rdquo; and 16 &lt; 20, so that makes sense. The thermostat works well. With a thermometer mounted on a nearby wall I&rsquo;ve correlated thermostat knob position to approximate room temperature and it&rsquo;s entirely repeatable. The side extension adjustment has been mentioned negatively in other reviews but I had no issues with it. I measured my window, subtracted the fan + left-side extension&rsquo;s width, then extended the right-side as needed and locked that adjustment before inserting the fan into the window, then slid the left-side extension into place and set the whole assembly down and lowered the window on top of it. This fan has allowed me to not use my A/C so far this year when all my neighbors have theirs running daily&hellip;what more could I ask for? I have this set to exhaust in my bedroom window and two windows (all 3 the same size) open in the living room so air flows in from a shaded patio and it&rsquo;s perfect for me. I really feel this is the best window fan on the market that&rsquo;s &lt;$100.</p>

<h5 id="good-but-not-the-best">Good but not the best.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We got the Holmes Twin Window Fan at the same time as we got the Bionaire Twin Reversible Airflow Window Fan for my son&rsquo;s room. I figured for the $10 price difference we didn&rsquo;t really need the remote control. While that is true, I kinda think the Boinaire is worth that, even without the remote. Reasons:- Noise. Both fans the same size, with pretty much the same size bladges, but the Holmes is much noisier! I&rsquo;m glad I planned this for the (super hot!) laundry room, not a bedroom, as its pretty loud.- The Bionaire Digital has temperature readout. You can see what the room temperature is, and set it to a temp to a target temp. With the Holmes you have a dial with dots from big to small. No indication what they are. On one hand this means it can&rsquo;t be poorly calibrated, on the other hand there is no way of knowing what temp you are setting unless you sit there and adjust it a lot.- Side extensions: the Bionaire came with two solid, and one expandable. The Holmes did not have an adjustable one. Fine, as long as you&rsquo;re house is a standard size. Ours is not.In general this is a fine fan, and if we had bought only one we might not be disappointed. But it is no competition for the Bionaire. That one is nice enough that we&rsquo;re ordering a second one for our bedroom!</p>

<h5 id="best-dual-window-fan-available">Best Dual Window Fan Available</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best you can get now, good volume, quiet as you&rsquo;ll get, I have a couple of these, longest a couple of yrs so far under heavy use, still going.FYI: Best such fan was made by Honeywell, actually in the US, needless to say, they don&rsquo;t do that anymore, it cost a few more bucks and who can &ldquo;pay for quality&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re likely to just be overpaying for some garbage from China. We need new &ldquo;Made in the USA&rdquo; labeling that means it, as opposed to the gov&rsquo;t definition corporation &ldquo;lobbied&rdquo; for, that it was partially assembled (as in label slapped on) in the USA, otherwise, 100% Chinese.</p>

<p>This is actually my third one of these window fans. They are so easy to use, and work so well circulating the air.</p>

<p>Works great. We leave in a one room apartment. This does the trick</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-quiet-good-flow">Easy to use, quiet, good flow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love that I don&rsquo;t have to take the fan out of the window in order to change the direction of the flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-was-looking-for">exactly what I was looking for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a window fan that could do both exhaust and intake, this fan is fantastic! I like that it has the ability to do one of each to help circulate our air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-very-well">Works very well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fit in my window perfectly and keeps things very cool. Very easy set up and easy to use.I would definitely recommend.</p>

<h5 id="like-the-fan">Like the fan.</h5>
