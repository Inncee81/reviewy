<h5 id="the-new-entry-level-gopro">The new Entry Level GoPro!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this review as a fairly new user of GoPro products. I&rsquo;ve tested the hero, hero+ LCD, and hero 4 session. Of the four, I only kept the hero 4 session for its form factor.A few key features/benefits of the Hero+ are:- Price PointAt $200, you get WiFi and Bluetooth. Those were the only real features missing on the every level Hero.- WiFi and BluetoothAs a new user, having a way to frame each shoot is important. All without having to buy the expensive $400 hero+ LCD model!- Instant Sharing with AppIt&rsquo;s the main reason why we record our activities. Now it&rsquo;s possible to share some it without hooking it up to a computer.-Simplified UISingle press Record and hold for Burst. It&rsquo;s not anything new with gopro, but I still find it super easy to use compared to China knockoffs.- (edited: no image stabilizer)- Auto low light captures better video, (gopro standard)In short, this is the best entry model GoPro. It&rsquo;s a clear upgrade from the original entry level Hero for an extra ~$70 and you get wifi. And with wifi, you get everything.If you&rsquo;re considering your first action camera, go GoPro. Go Hero+.If you found this review helpful, please click the HELPFUL button below. Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="forget-the-lcd-screen-wifi-1080p-hd-under-200">Forget the LCD Screen - WiFi, 1080p HD under $200</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is my first &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Amazon review as I feel this product truly merits it. I not only like this product, I love it, and find myself looking for possible uses for it beyond the security setup I have planned (explained below)To save readers time, I&rsquo;ve attached a single frame snap &amp; sped up video of a dash-cam setup, more on par with real world usage. I used one of the two 3M VHB backed mounts to mount it on my car&rsquo;s dashboard. The other mount is curved, would conform to a helmet.Comes out of the box waterproof with an additional back backing for optimal voice &amp; sound in wind under 100mph. No microSD card included, so grab the $199 Amazon bundle while you can which includes a 32G high speed microSD card.In addition to the video attached, I&rsquo;ve added a frame snap, as I took it at full 1080p HD. You will see GoPro&rsquo;s wide angle quality, what merited this review alone. I recorded myself driving back home at night as a test, excuse the darkness, the snapshot will give you an idea of a snap from the 60fps 1080p HD video recorded. I was shocked to see I drove up to 7-11 and could literally make out the cashier counting money at the register later on. Full review and context follows below.I&rsquo;ve been using a handful of DLink Cameras in parallel with UBNTEK&rsquo;s Mac Application for a cheap yet quality surveillance setup. Mostly D-Link Wireless Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled (DCS-932L) and the more recent DCS-934L. I even just spent $149 on their 1MP camera.I thought they were brilliant and the best quality for the price&hellip; The latest purchase was $149 on sale for a WiFi enabled 1MP DLink Camera. It was great, all cameras were &lsquo;interior&rsquo; rated but have stood up to NJ winters with the ethernet taped over. Unfortunately the latest 1MP camera has numerous holes for heat dissipation, so I needed a camera for semi-outdoor usage that had more than scotch tape as weatherproofing.Reading up, I heard about the GoPro HERO + that was coming out, same makers of the cams that TV shows such as Top Gear, use and have previously been &lsquo;off limits&rsquo; for every day consumers at their pricing. It was a week off until they were released, but I figured I would wait. I don&rsquo;t go skiing, kayaking, or anything remotely interesting enough to merit the usual $300+ price-tag of their more expensive brothers. But seeing this entry level GoPro HERO+ price under $200 with the promo pack with a 32G card piqued my interest.I purchased it Oct 8 the day it was released. 2 days later it arrived. I have never been so impressed of the build quality of a product at this price. The waterproof clip actually feels waterproof, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to use the waterproof feature if I needed, not something I could say even looking at some of the waterproof cellphones out.The 32G card is rated as giving just under 3 hours at 1080p HD. If you&rsquo;re recording long trips, I would suggest a USB cord or a battery booster pack. I didn&rsquo;t recharge the system after my first 1 hour trip, used it again, and it died during the trip back. I couldn&rsquo;t tell, but that was because of a feature I activated, which turned off the rear facing LED so I wouldn&rsquo;t be distracted during night driving, can&rsquo;t remove a star for that.The most impressive feature is what most worried me at first, the &lsquo;WiFi&rsquo; function and bluetooth. With a few clicks of the top and front buttons I put the camera into WiFi mode. Without even reading the instructions, just downloading the Android App I was paired in 5 seconds, surprised WiFi paired that fast. It will auto-disconnect you from your current WiFi and hop on the GoPro&rsquo;s WiFi. Full high speed zero latency viewing from the application. So you can mount it in your car or helmet, open your app, check the view is what you want, and click record from the Android App. You can also watch videos back, or use it as a live viewer.I am glad I saved $100 as I didn&rsquo;t need the LCD screen with the WiFi function. It also has a function to mark / highlight parts of the video that you want to view later. The app is very intuitive and I created the high speed video summary of part of my drive in 5 minutes.Overall just a great product at a game-changing price. I&rsquo;ve already purchased a second promo bundle that includes the a 32G micro SDHC card that sadly is missing from the retail box.If I had to complain, it would be over a lack of any microSD out of the box, but at this price, I&rsquo;m even up in the air about that!UPDATE: LIVE preview while recording was not available ONLY in 1080p HD mode. I turned to the UltraView (very very Wide view) 720P HD last night and this morning and was able to watch and adjust my camera <em>while</em> I recorded on a drive (albeit parked of course)I can not sing the praises of this brilliant little piece of technology more. Feel free to reply with any questions about operation, I&rsquo;m currently doing a test of the time-lapse mode, which I initiated <em>from my phone</em> to my parked car around 100 yards away. I need to update my poor battery life was MY FAULT. Lack of turning it off when not in use after parking. I found this out when I was able to start a time-lapse preview from my house far away from the card. The little bugger was still on in WiFi. I drained it accidentally due to lack of RTFM. If you do so, you will have smooth sailing. Snatch one (or three) up while you can.Best,Kris</p>

<h5 id="wallet-friendly-gopro">Wallet-Friendly GoPro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am addicted to instant gratification. Not in the sense of repetitious smart phone games or the magical cheesiness of Nacho Cheese Doritos. I&rsquo;m talking about the instant adrenaline rush you receive from twisting the throttle wide open on a CR500 or jumping off of a 80ft man-made dam into a lake. These certain acts of instant gratification need to be shared with the world, so that people at home can experience the magic.For a long time, I&rsquo;ve wanted a GoPro, but the models available didn&rsquo;t have enough features or were too expensive. I&rsquo;ve been looking around at a GoPro alternative, but I didn&rsquo;t trust other brands. I&rsquo;ve seen GoPros go through an astonishing amount of abuse and not break. My favorite adrenaline inducing hobby is riding dirtbikes and I crash more than most, I&rsquo;m sure. At the price point of $199, I was able to purchase a camera that will record awesome footage and be extremely durable.I was also wanting a GoPro version that wasn&rsquo;t too spendy that had 1080p at 60fps and Wifi. When I saw this GoPro listed on Amazon last week, I immediately knew I was going to buy it. Not only do you get 1080p/60fps and Wifi, you get everything listed in the description above in the Amazon ad.I&rsquo;m proud of this purchase and I hope other people that were apprehensive about purchasing a GoPro do it now and start creating their own awesome videos to share with friends and family.</p>
