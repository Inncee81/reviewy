<h5 id="works-good-good-price-repete-buyer">works good, good price. repete buyer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my go-to cable whenever needed. I had bad luck with a couple of walmart cables before trying this one. Since then I have ordered quite a few. Never have had any issues. Not much to say about cables they work good or they don&rsquo;t work good. I like the price on this one and just wanted to drop my recommendation these are a good deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="blue-and-red-pixels-when-connected-through-an-hdmi-receiver">Blue and red pixels when connected through an HDMI receiver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An HDMI cable is an HDMI cable right? Wrong! Although this cable worked fine when connected directly to my TV and the laptop, whenever there was an HDMI receiver in the middle of the two there were a bunch of blue and red pixels on the screen. Some might say this might be the problem with the receiver itself, but no other cable displayed such behavior on the receiver, only this one did. I did isolate the problem to be in the cable and not rest of the equipment. I have used quite a few generic cables before and never experienced such problems. This cable may work for you if you are going directly into the TV, but not if you have an HDMI switch or a receiver in the middle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-piece-of-junk">A piece of junk.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cable did not perform adequately. It left hundreds of blocky color artifacts in the transmission, resulting in awful screen quality. It was a gamble at this low price&hellip; one that I lost. I tried it on several different applications and it was junk on all of them. It was probably returned by somebody else and they just palmed it off on me. I threw it in the garbage so nobody else would get burned. I won&rsquo;t be buying from Link Depot again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-cable-for-my-use">Best cable for my use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Big fan. All of the HDMI cables I order are big and bulky. The weight alone is enough to damage the HDMI inputs on most monitors. These are the perfect size to use. I run karaoke and I always need to hook a cable into the expensive TVs many bars and clubs install. I don&rsquo;t need the wire weight damaging the inputs. These cables work great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cable-with-a-small-wire">Great cable with a small wire.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cable works well for connecting two devices that are far from one another. I use it to connect a PC to a TV nearly twenty feet away. The cord is easily maneuverable and can be hidden along a wall or inside a hanging ceiling if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="0-for-5-working-not-a-good-sign-too-thin">0 for 5 working - not a good sign. Too thin.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would give it a zero star if I could. The 25ft version was 0 for 5. I ordered 5 of these to use to connect computers to overhead TV&rsquo;s in an office. I figured as I always do with electronic I should test it before trying to run the cable. I connected my laptop to my HDTV. My laptop has 1080p HDMI output. I have used it with cables from 6 to 15 feet in length from other manufacturers.When the link depot cables were connected there was tons of snow and lines that was from bad to downright awful depending on the cable. I tried different ends and even unrolling the cable to see if it was due to the cable being coiled. Nothing helped. I have five useless cables now.The big thing that I noticed is the cables are WAY TOO THIN. It seems nice but without a dedicated chip like some have for directional use in a long HDMI cable I think this thin cable just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. I thought I would get a cable that would work. I&rsquo;m extremely disappointed. Amazon got it here quickly but now what do I do with a useless cable?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-until-it-didn-t">Worked great until it didn&rsquo;t</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this and I cannot remember if it came on time or not, but I&rsquo;m almost certain it did. The reason I&rsquo;m giving this product three stars is because only about a month, if that long, after receiving it (I started using it right away), the one end of the wire would no longer work. I tried switching the broken end from my laptop to my TV and it made no difference - I was trying to see if the issue was one of my devices. I&rsquo;m not sure what the issue with the cord is but is is officially broken: I will see if there is something I can do to render it useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-and-works-as-needed-until-4k-came-around">Great value and works as needed&hellip; until 4K came around</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needed some longer HDMI cables to run through a plastic conduit to hide in the wall. Was a little worried about the price vs. quality but these work just as well as more expensive cables I&rsquo;ve used. Come with plastic protectors on the ends and survived a run through the conduit (2 corner bends) and work just great.Update 2017: These have served me well over the years until it was time to update my hardware. I had an older Samsung TV (to be replaced soon) and bought a new PS4 Pro. Initial connection worked - but then started getting staticky screens and pops through audio. Tried another one of these cables (have 3 separate ones ran through the wall) and the 2nd one was worse. I plugged the PS4Pro directly into the TV using the cable that came with it and the issue went away - which led me to believe it was the cable. It turns out that HDMI cables have also been updated over the years and these cables are no longer what is required to support the newer video connections.</p>

<h5 id="works-well">Works well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I find it very easy to operate and as commodity description. I am satisfied with it, I will recommend to friends! Very functional. Love how easy it is. What a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Length is awesome for me. can go anywhere in bedroom or living room - to hook up tv to laptop</p>
