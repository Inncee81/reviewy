<p>Esky EC135-05 Rearview Cameras</p>

<p>Reversing accidents, some know it as Bye-Bye Syndrome, but did you know that it costs lives every year? Research shows that even using a rearview mirror, you could still easily hit objects, animals or even little ones that are too small to be seen through your rear windshield.</p>

<p>Thankfully there is an easy solution.
Rearview cameras like Esky EC135-05 can be mounted anywhere on the reverse side of your car. Free from obstructions (like say those of a trailer or the boxes in your trunk) they provide a full view of everything behind your car, in darkness or in daylight.</p>

<p>At Esky, we are especially proud of the EC135-05, our latest rearview camera that offers a wide, 135° viewfinder that’ll have you sure the coast is clear the next time you put your car into reverse. The EC135-05 comes fitted with 7 infrared LED lights, that assist the camera when lighting conditions would be inadequate for most regular cameras.</p>

<p>What’s more 420 TV lines of high resolution deliver a seamless and detailed image. Meaning you rest assured that when Esky gives you the all clear, the way really has been cleared for you to reverse.</p>

<p>Easy Installation</p>

<p>1.Mount the camera to your car&rsquo;s license plate area, back window, or any other suitable place
2.Adjust the lens of the camera for full rearview clarity.
3.Connect power wire (red and black) to your vehicle DC 12V power system.
4.Connect the video output (yellow wire) of the camera to the display in your vehicle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BAD..BAD&hellip;Do NOT Buy.not rain proof. first rain broke both water inside housing. Seller would not replace. wasted money. Look at pictures . In CA we get barely any rain.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera-great-price-easy-to-install-in-a-97-yukon">Great Camera, Great Price, Easy to Install in a 97 Yukon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera did the trick. Exactly as described and very easy to install on a 1997 GMC Yukon. Only issue that I haf is that the design of the camera mount would have covered up my Registration Sticker on my plate&hellip;. may not be an issue in other states, but is an issue here in MT. I had a couple of choices, either modify the mount by cutting off part of it, or mounting it above the plate&hellip; I chose to mount above the plate and it worked very well in my application. I now have the perfect view of the trailer ball on my receiver hitch and should be able to view my Jet Ski Trailer perfectly&hellip;. without the camera&hellip; you have to drop the tailgate to see the trailer when it is empty because it is so narrow and low you can&rsquo;t see it through the back window. This camera appears to be well made and has a sharp picture&hellip; night vision works great&hellip; with the backup lights and the night vision&hellip; I can see clearly on a 5 inch monitor. Great Camera, Great Price, and easy to install&hellip;.. included the perfect amount of cable to reach from my back license plate, routed through the frame on the underbody of the Yukon, up through the engine compartment and into the cab through the firewall&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="product-was-as-described-and-was-easily-installed-on-my-2002-yukon-xl">Product was as described and was easily installed on my 2002 Yukon XL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product was as described and was easily installed on my 2002 Yukon XL. The cables were just long enough to do the installation without having to add any additional wire. Lens has been fog free the last few weeks with all the rain and snow we have been having. The image is not crystal clear but its not an HD camera so its what I expected. Using it for backing up to my RV and so far have hit the mark every time on the first try. No more turn left no the other left now right no back the other way. Ran it off the reverse light to the camera input on my radio so it comes on when I place it in reverse. Order was process quickly and shipped promptly. I would buy from this seller again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-build-and-quality">Solid build and quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera out of the box looks solid and of very good quality. Included are the RCA Video wire, long enough to cover length of any vehicle. The power wire for tapping into the reverse Signal wire. I went and did a pre-install scan to see how I will tackle this job. My 06 WRX (SW) has a wall of metal just behind the bumper and a hard to reach wire grommet that leads in. Plus I have a plate frame which I do not want to remove and noticed that the bracket on this camera far extends to cover the registration stickers on the plate. So I did a modification to rid the camera of the brackets and to mount it with 3M extreme double sided tape (This is the thin gray tape that sticks like crazy glue). See pic of the modification and Install.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-happy-with-purchase">Not happy with purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera arrived and was hooked up however the only reverse image displayed was a rolling black screen. The installer said that he believed the camera itself was faulty. When tried to find out about return it stated I was past the deadline. I was unable to install it right away so I can&rsquo;t blame the company for that but it was still a defective camera</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointed-hopefully-mine-is-defective">Very disappointed hopefully mine is defective?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a great product wirh a good picture, especially for the price. However in the last 4 months I have discovered it is definitely not waterproof! It has been clouded up or has extreme condensation trapped in the lens that used to evaporate after a day of rain however- now it is full of water which makes it not waterproof. The lens does not come off so there&rsquo;s no way to clean it or dry it out. Maybe I have a defective one???? I will try to contact the seller and update this post or purchase another one from someone else :-(. Very disappointed.UPDATE: 10 days later with no rain, still can&rsquo;t see a thing out of this camera!! 4 more pictures added&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-outstanding-customer-service">Good product, OUTSTANDING Customer Service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously gave this product 3 stars because the picture from the camera was poor quality and had lines through it. I figured that the camera was just cheap so I got what I paid for. I was WAY wrong, so this is my edited review.Almost immediately after I posted my review, I got an e-mail from the seller. They offered to send me a replacement unit for free and didn&rsquo;t even require me to send the old unit back! Of course I said yes! I hooked up the replacement device, and low and behold the picture quality is AWESOME! Way better than I would expect from a camera at this price point.While I am pleased with the product, most importantly I am BLOWN AWAY by the outstanding customer service of this seller. They made it clear that they would stop at nothing until I was 100% satisfied with my purchase. I buy A TON of products on Amazon, and this is by far the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever received on here. Thank you for setting the bar that all other Amazon sellers should strive for.</p>
