<h5 id="slightly-stinky-at-first-but-great-bag">Slightly stinky at first but GREAT bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Closest to what I was looking for. The straps are very comfortable even when I have it loaded down with my 12.9inch iPad Pro and my 13 inch MacBook Air at the same time. I like the USB port that I can hook up to my portable charger (that is not included, but I already had one for camping) Just enough pockets to keep things organized without going overboard. It also stands up fairly straight when set on the floor. It irritates me when bags flop over to the front when I set them down (This may not be an issue for anyone else, but it makes me happy)Like many other inexpensive items it is a little stinky when you first get it, but not unbearable. I have a strong sense of smell so I&rsquo;m glad this wasn&rsquo;t as strong as some other items I&rsquo;ve ordered over the years.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-was-almost-there-but-in-the-end-the-lack-of-any-waterproofing-got-me">It was almost there, but in the end the lack of any waterproofing got me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried to like it, I really did. I purchased this as a replacement for my Targus. Iâve had two of those, they lasted for a total of fifteen years. The current model is the CVR600.The pockets are not very well designed, some are way too deep, others are too small. The straps are slightly uncomfortable on my back. But I was going to muddle through, I like the blue color.But today, I took a five minute walk through a moderate rain. When I got home, the bag was soaking wet, and my laptop had water on it.Iâm going back to my Targus. Sorry, really canât recommend this.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="graded-a-for-looks-and-f-for-poor-charging">Graded A for looks and F for poor charging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived and tested out the charging capabilities and it was spotty. Plugged my phone into the exterior plugin of the backpack, which was connected to a portable battery pack and the power connection would go in and out randomly, even without touching it. Disconnected the phone and plugged it straight into the battery pack and had zero issues charging. I double checked all the cords were fully plugged in and tried again with the same results so I determined the backpack cords are the issue and I will be returning this backpack and purchasing another brand.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="nice-back-pack">Nice back pack!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this bag pack, It fits my 15 inch laptop great. The charging port works great, and I can charge my phone and hike at same time. The color looks great and has lots of pocket too. Highly recommend!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-nice-computer-bag">This is a very nice computer bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice computer bag, it is water resistant and the weight of the bag itself is really light, it is awesome for changing function as well.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-boys">Good for boys</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thick material, water proof, seemed very sturdy, nice padding, carry comfortably on shoulders, will be used for school and carry laptop, also plan to use for trips and hikes. Wish it is a bit larger and lighter.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-a-wondeful-bag">Overall a wondeful bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a wonderful bag very comfortable meaning that I ride my bike around campus while wearing it. Lots of deep pockets good for storage. The main pocket for books and your laptop is great the laptop pocket is very well padded and you have room for at least 4 thick textbooks and some room left. The charger port is very convient when needing to charge up. And all the clips/ materials it&rsquo;s made with are very strong and high quality.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-laptop-15-6-inch-dell-hardly-fits-in-it">My laptop (15.6-inch Dell) hardly fits in it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It says: &ldquo;Fits 15.6 inch Laptop&rdquo; but my 15.6-inch Dell laptop hardly fits in it, also It doesn&rsquo;t protect the laptop if it falls on the edges. The quality is not what I expected. I don&rsquo;t recommend carrying your pc inside the backpack during a long rain.However if you have a smaller laptop and want a backpack where you can get many things and that is waterproof during a soft rain, you may like.READ MORE</p>
