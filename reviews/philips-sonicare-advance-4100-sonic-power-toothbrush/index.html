<blockquote>
<p>My hygienist has always commented how well my teeth are cleaned by this Sonicare. However, in the 15 years I&rsquo;ve used various models of this type, I&rsquo;ve had to buy 4-5 because of the NiCD rechargeable batteries they use, and which I hated.ProsWorks very well, dentist gradevigorous brushingSimple to useCharger is effortless and inductive, no exposed connectionsConsBattery dies in 2 years, needs to be &lsquo;reconditioned&rsquo;Expensive brushesExpensive handleDisposable, the handle is rubber coated and sealedWhile the expected lifetime of the battery is 5 years or more, the NiCD have a &lsquo;memory effect&rsquo; and to get rid of it you have to run the brush down to near zero power. Alas, it has a built it timer, so can&rsquo;t just leave it on so it will run down on its own. You have to keep using it, and then one day, it stops working, now you can&rsquo;t brush. In the years I&rsquo;ve owned it, However, even with reconditioning by 3 years you&rsquo;d only get 3 days of per charge doing once a day brushing compared to nearly a week when new, mainly because even if powered to &lsquo;near&rsquo; zero you can&rsquo;t really deep discharge these batteries without unmounting it, which means destroying the handle. So the reconditioning can only go so far.I&rsquo;ve since converted to the e-series AA battery model which is now going past 5 years, and its battery is strong and reliable, because I can replace it myself and it needs to be recharged only every 3-4 months using eneloopÂ eneloop AAA 1800 cycle, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries, 8 Pack.</p>

<p>I had been using one of those $5 battery toothbrushes for years. I always brushed 2 min in fact I had a route I walked my house so as to brush long enough turns out I was brushing 3 min. LOL Now with this toothbrush it times the 2 min for me, I still walk. My teeth feel so clean just like I came from the dentist. One big thing I noticed Is I floss after brushing and there would always be some little somthing that the floss caught. Now there is NOTHING from the floss. AMAZING.I highly recommend this brush. It was a great value and I wish I had gotten it sooner. I&rsquo;m a fanatic about keeping clean teeth and at my last checkup didn&rsquo;t even have to have a cleaning as there was no plaque or tartar to clean. I cannot wait to see what my dentist says this time.My only con to the product is the packaging. If you have bad arthritis in your hands you may have trouble getting the package open. Inside the box the unit is sealed in that hard molded plastic. very hard to cut open and then the sharp plastic cut my hand. traditional cardboard dividers would have done just as well. I just mention this as if you are alone with no one to help you it can be difficult.</p>

<h5 id="my-dental-hygienist-thinks-it-works-great">my dental hygienist thinks it works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this product a year ago with great reluctance. Ordinarily, I spend about one dollar on a toothbrush. Replaced monthly, that&rsquo;s 12 dollars a year. So the cost put me off.On the other hand, I had my first cavities filled in two decades last year, and that wasn&rsquo;t inexpensive (or fun) either. And no matter how much I brushed and flossed, every visit my hygienist gave me a bad time about tartar build up and gum problems.So I took the plunge.I used it about 3 months prior to my next dental appointment, and did not say a word about it. My hygienist noticed a big difference and was effusive about how well I was taking care of my teeth. So I guess this vibrator with a brush on the end is not all hype!I&rsquo;ve followed the advice of reviewers who report long product life: I only place it in the charger when it needs charging, and then I charge it for 24 hours. I&rsquo;m hoping to get five years out of it.The only problem I encountered was increased sensitivity to cold - this went away when I reduced the use to once a day. Other brushings I use a regular toothbrush.Also, it is probably not a good idea for most of us to use toothpastes with silica &ldquo;whiteners&rdquo; with a brush like this - you don&rsquo;t want to remove your enamel, just the plaque!So, my opinion is that this is a great product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My sister originally recommended the 4 series to me (in 1999) because she had to have skin grafts because of excessive brushing, which I also tend to do. This series was recommended to her by her oral surgeon. This is now the second Sonicare 4 series I have owned. The first was purchased in late 1999 and had finally developed a small crack in the frame. Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t want a different model because of the longevity of my first one. My only dissatisfaction is caused by something I missed when picking this replacement. My first Sonicare 4 series paused slightly every 30 seconds as an alert to change from upper to lower, and also front to behind. It ran for a total of two minutes. This newer model runs for a total of two minutes, but doesn&rsquo;t pause every 30 seconds to let you know to change position. I am now using a stopwatch which is a little bit of a pain first thing in the morning, but otherwise okay. I just wish that I had paid closer attention to the item details before making the purchase. I don&rsquo;t know if the 4 series still offers the 30 second pause function, and if it doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know that I would have paid more than $20 extra for the function to get one of the newer series. This may be of no issue to anyone else, but I just bring it up for former 4 series owners who expect the same functionality.</p>

<p>This is the very first generation of the Philips Sonicare line. The other ones are cheaply made. Have no idea why they even created other ones when the 4100 is the very best in show. Change the heads every 2-3 months and wash off the toothbrush after you use it. It has a nice little plastic cap on top of the bristles so you don&rsquo;t get germs on the head when not in use. It cleans your teeth perfectly and has a nice feel weight wise. Thanks for keeping this one alive.</p>
