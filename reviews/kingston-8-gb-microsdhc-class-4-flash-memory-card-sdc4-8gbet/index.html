<h5 id="inexpensive-8-gb-microsd-card-with-sd-adapter-good-for-music-or-gps">Inexpensive 8 gb microSD card with SD adapter, good for music or GPS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this card specifically for use in a Garmin Oregon handheld GPS. It is a class IV, so speed wise it is not a blazing fast performer, and is probably best for &ldquo;static&rdquo; data applications like storing MP3 music in a media player or cell phone, or maps in a GPS (which is what I bought it for). By &ldquo;static&rdquo;, I mean applications where the device is mostly only reading data and not writing much. This card will also work well in smaller or older digital cameras of 12 megapixels or less, for still photography or VGA video (640 x 480). Class IV cards like this will almost certainly NOT work for high-def video.As a camera card, I would only use Kingston or Transcend cards with caution. I have only experienced a few SD card failures in digital cameras since switching from film to digital in 2003, but both were from Kingston and Transcend cards. I have never had a Sandisk card give me any problems in a camera.Using these lower priced cards for music or GPS mapping data is not going to pose a problem since you have (or should have) the data backed up on your main computer at home. If a card fails, just buy a new one (8 gb cards are dirt cheap) and re-write the data. But a failure of a card in a camera, say on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation, is another matter - you don&rsquo;t want to take any risks with an economy priced memory card when the same sized Sandisk card is probably only a couple dollars more.SUMMARY: A budget priced 8gb class 4 micro-SD card with an adapter, so you can use it in almost any device that takes either Micro or Regular SD cards. Works well for read-only applications like music or GPS mapping where you only write the data to the card once, but use with caution in digital cameras, especially for critical photography where a card failure would be a major calamity. This card is NOT SUITABLE for high def video (resolution more than 640 x 480 at 30 fps). The Amazon Frustration-free packaging is nice: much easier to open than a typical heat sealed blister pack.</p>

<h5 id="paid-my-own-shipping-for-rma">Paid my own shipping for RMA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kingston honors their warranty but I had to pay my own shipping on RMA - and it is hard to justify paying shipping on cheaper older cards. Sandisk on the other hand paid for RMA shipping when I went through that process with both brands recently. Ultimately a good product so I won&rsquo;t ding too bad on stars but can&rsquo;t give 5 when Sandisk wins the warranty/RMA war. I recommend Sandisk SD cards instead.</p>

<h5 id="experiencing-errors-using-8gb-cards-on-raspberry-pi">Experiencing errors using 8GB cards on raspberry pi</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:The batch of cards I received on January, 2016 have been experiencing issues. One card failed after 4 and a half months and was replaced. The next card failed in about two weeks. I replaced it with a fresh unused card, and it failed in three days.[237493.729272] mmc0: Timeout waiting for hardware interrupt.[237493.729502] mmcblk0: error -110 transferring data, sector 122880, nr 8, cmd response 0x900, card status 0xc00[237493.729664] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 122880[237493.729687] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk0p2, logical block 0, lost sync page writePreviously I had been using these cards without issue, and I don&rsquo;t think anything in my configuration has changed. Space utilization of the last card was about 47% when it failed after 3 days of use. I verified that there was not much data being written to the card, just a few log files when cron jobs and such ran. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve taken the step of adding the following lines to /etc/fstab, to mount directories that are commonly written to by the linux OS as tmpfs. This was a suggestion I found on zdnet:# add to /etc/fstabtmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=100m 0 0tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=30m 0 0tmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=100m 0 0tmpfs /var/run tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=2m 0 0This has eliminated the periodic writes due to log files and such. I will update this review if I see continued issues with these cards.original review:I am using these micro-SD cards for raspberry pi projects. The cards have been working fine. Each card comes with a micro-SD to SD adapter, which I really don&rsquo;t need anymore as I seem to have accumulated a pile of them from previous card purchases. I&rsquo;ve had absolutely no problem with these cards. 8 GB is more than enough space for the typical raspberry pi. I&rsquo;ve had the cards long enough to have them in constant operation in several pi projects for several months and there have been no errors</p>

<h5 id="bought-for-the-emerson-action-cam-reliable-economy">Bought for the Emerson Action Cam - Reliable Economy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased for the Emerson Action Cam that required a Class 4 - and Kingston hit the spot with economy. And I also like how Kingston always seems to include adaptors with all their memory cards, which seems to be a hit or miss with other brands.Transfer speeds are naturally much slower, especially when dealing with Gigabytes, but reliable. That&rsquo;s the big thumbs up right there. :)One last note: You will see TF marked quite often on all manner of devices, especially on Bluetooth Speakers. TF is the acronym of TransFlash, the original name of Secure Digital (SD) - one in the same. Now some TF labeled card slots usually want the large size&hellip; and thus why I always keep these included adaptors tucked away. They are merely shells and will work with ANY microSD card. So why I see a sale, I can just purchase them without worry if they come with adaptors or not.</p>

<h5 id="8gb-16gb-great-for-use-in-multiple-devices-other-than-cameras">8GB &amp; 16GB Great For Use In Multiple Devices Other Than Cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 3 each of the 8GB and 16GB cards because I need inexpensive micro SD cards for an increasing number of devices. It used to be that I used SD cards only in cameras, but now I have phones, tablets, &ldquo;spy&rdquo; glasses, video recorder glasses, etc., all needing micro SD cards as memory.I don&rsquo;t need to waste my expensive 32GB class 10 SD cards for these devices, class 4 cards work fine and cost much less. Each card comes wih an adapter.I have used Kingston SD cards before without any problem and the 8GB cards are working fine.</p>
