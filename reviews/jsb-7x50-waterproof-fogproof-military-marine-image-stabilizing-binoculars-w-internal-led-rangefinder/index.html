<h5 id="rangefinder-waterproof-clear-durable">Rangefinder! Waterproof! Clear! Durable!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> My husband is a gun and tactical equipment expert. He loves tactical gear and these binoculars were a huge hit! They come in a nice army green bag and shoulder sling. They are a good quality binoculars and very durable. They are not too heavy. They have rubber covers for both ends of the binoculars that easily come on and off. My husband’s favorite feature is the internal rangefinder. Also it’s WATERPROOF. These can go through the most extreme conditions and still be reliable. We most commonly uses these at the gun range, for hunting, traveling and for events. The clarity and focus of these binoculars are impressive. No squinting necessary. They are super clear and perfect for anyone who loves the outdoors. Overall this is a solid pair of binoculars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="he-was-thrilled-to-get-this-as-a-gift-and-like-a-child">He was thrilled to get this as a gift and like a child</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these binoculars for my dad. He is a retired professional fisherman. He loves gadgets of all kinds. He was thrilled to get this as a gift and like a child, immediately started to play with his &ldquo;new toy&rdquo;. By no means are these binoculars a toy in any way. They look and ARE professional grade. The military green color is flawless. He loves that they are waterproof and fogproof. They are not heavy and easy to handle. Eyes focus inmediately and the color and picture are crystal clear. We are going to Greece this summer and he can&rsquo;t wait to bring it with him while he is out at sea. Great product. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of binoculars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-will-be-pleased-with-the-quality">You will be pleased with the quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always wanted to buy a good quality pair of binoculars and am very pleased with the JSB. These will come in handy on hunting trips and for outdoor hiking trips for wildlife viewing. These will also be great for whale and sea lion watching on my trips to the northern California coast where I grew up. If you are a hunter or just a wildlife watcher, you will be very pleased with these binoculars. I have been very pleased with these so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros-Good pictureEasy zoomHigh qualityAwesome carrying caseCon-It seemed to me that it was actually tell me the distance things were from me, but in reality it gives you a formula to use that helps determine distance. This was my fault for not understanding what was offered so it doesn&rsquo;t affect the number of stars, but it is a little disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-for-the-price">Excellent product for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After discovering where the button for the stablizing feature was enabled I was very pleased. Not comparable to the Canon 10x30 or 10x50 but miles apart when it comes to price. Very good value - will work fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="heavy-duty-with-clear-picture">Heavy duty with clear picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had access to military grade so can&rsquo;t compare that but this thing is heavy freaking duty! It has a great weight to it - not too heavy - just enough that tells you its not a cheap pair. It has a clear picture and is easily adjustable. Overall this is a winner and I give it five stars. Please ask if you have any questions!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="false-advertising-no-stabilization">False Advertising, No Stabilization.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>False advertisement. There is no image stabilization. I unfortunately missed my return date or I would ship this junk right back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="need-to-focus-each-eyepiece-individually">Need to focus each eyepiece individually.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these for watching birds.At 2 pounds, they are pretty heavy. But the optics are good, with a wide field of vision.Unfortunately, each eyepiece must be focused individually / separately.This makes focusing on different birds slow and cumbersome.I am sure that they would be good for other applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-stabilizing">NOT STABILIZING</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing &ldquo;stabilizing&rdquo; about these. I gave 2 stars because the clarity and overall quality was ok</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="retired-marine-approved">Retired Marine Approved!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> These binoculars are awesome. I got them for my husband who is a retired Marine. When I told I was getting him some military grade binoculars he laughed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-set-of-binoculars">A great set of binoculars!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great!!! My husband hasn&rsquo;t put them down! He plans on using them for the upcoming hunting season. Very pleased with the storage bag they come with as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="undecided">Undecided</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Look great, feel great. Advertised as image stabilized but does not seem to be. Manual was for sailing binoculars so if there is a switch it&rsquo;s not visible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-husband-took-these-to-work-to-brag-about-how-amazing-they-were">My Husband Took These To Work To Brag About How Amazing They Were</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband was in the military and recently started hunting. I surprised him with these binoculars and honestly was crossing my fingers they were a hit.</p>
