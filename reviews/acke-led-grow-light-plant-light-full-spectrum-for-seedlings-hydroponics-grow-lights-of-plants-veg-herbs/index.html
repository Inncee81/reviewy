<h5 id="perfect-for-dorms">Perfect for Dorms!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in Syracuse during the winter so, as you can imagine, it snows a lot and it&rsquo;s very cloudy for the majority of the winter. I also live in a dorm that does not face the sun and went overboard at the beginning of the school year buying plants, so I was worried about wilting during this time. I wanted a lamp that didn&rsquo;t get too hot (dorm policies, you know) and that can cover all my plants. I just got this a couple of days ago and I&rsquo;m already in love and stopped worrying whether my plants were receiving enough light, especially since the last couple of days were extremely cloudy. The zip ties were also great for hanging my lamp right above my plants, where they can get an equal distribution of light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-results-so-far">Amazing results so far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The plants that I&rsquo;ve grown so far under this light produce greener leaves than my other lights I use. I know this because I just started some plants, half under a 2 different lights thinking nothing of it but over 2 days I could see..the plants under these lights were the same size but the leaves are allot greener than the other batch from the same seeds ect..I saw that, big difference &amp; so Then moved all the plants from this batch under 2 of these lights now. I took a picture of it also. I will most likely be useing threes lights just for this, small plants ect..very bright don&rsquo;t even have this in the same room with you unless its blocked good, while working around the light I I always wear &ldquo;grow room&rdquo; glasses that take away that crazy color like in the picture. the plants seem to really love these lights I would love to have 2 more!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-light">Great little light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased 4 of these grow lights to start our garden seedlings, I installed them in a Big Lots outdoor 4 shelf greenhouse. They don&rsquo;t put off alot of heat but that&rsquo;s great for our purpose(dont want to burn the plastic greenhouse cover)They are well made and put off alot of light. Started them up on Saturday on a timer from 6 am to 9 pm and went downstairs today to water the seedlings and sprouts were about an inch tall today on Wednesday. Highly recommend! I will be buying more of these to add another greenhouse to our arsenal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-grow-light">Excellent grow light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far this light is working perfectly. I have a small tray of seedlings started and currently under this light. Tomato, basil and thyme. I like that it doesn&rsquo;t take up a lot of room or electricity, will probably be purchasing another one as my little kitchen garden grows.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-results">Great results.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It took three days for the seedlings to show growth with this lamp. I mix in natural sun when possible, but use the lamp about 18 hours a day and it easily covered the 50 seedling planter kit.</p>

<h5 id="used-this-light-for-2-days-and-it-burned-out">Used this light for 2 days and it burned out &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this light for 2 days and it burned out. The PCB is burnt between the positive and negative connections from the power supply. Nothing else plugged into the surge strip was damaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-lights">Love the lights</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased on April 15th. My tomato and pepper seedlings were struggling growing on the window sill of the temporary rental we are in right now, not getting enough light, loosing all their green and not growing well. It took only 3 days and my plants started greening up and and after 10 days they were looking real healthy and strong. I thought I was going to loose all my seedlings. I love it and I just bought one more because my seedlings grew so well I had to re-pot them today and they are using up more space. I never has such strong, healthy looking plants with the fluorescent lights on my grow table</p>
