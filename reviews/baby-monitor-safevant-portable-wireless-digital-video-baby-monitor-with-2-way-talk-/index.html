<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="impressive-night-vision">Impressive night vision.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Product Specs:-Two way talk.-Easy setup.-Far range monitoring.Product Reviews:The package comes with the camera, the monitor, two power adapters, a charging dock and user manual. The camera is in the shape of a bird, which is a nice theme for babies. This one was baby blue for boys. The pairing was easy and quick. It was as simple as plugging in my camera and turning on the monitor.The monitor has multiple functions. You can talk directly into the monitor to speak out of the camera. This allows you to directly communicate directly to your little one. It also has built-in lullaby songs to help put your baby to sleep and stay asleep. You can adjust the volume and brightness as well.The night vision mode was the most impressive. I turned off the lights and it was completely pitched black and the camera manage to get a black and white feed. This has really great night vision and overall, a impressive unit for monitoring.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-parents">A must have for parents</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> So easy to use I didn&rsquo;t need to read the user manual.The video quality is pretty clear and i really like the night vision for when it&rsquo;s dark.There are speakers and microphones on both of the monitor and the camera.Also, there is a play music feature to help baby sleep.It comes with 2 chargers: one for the camera and one for the monitor which also holds charge.Overall a really good product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-video-and-battery-powered">Good quality video and battery powered</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My sister has twins so she really needed this. We opened it at her baby shower to test it out and it&rsquo;s super cool.The video monitor is battery powered, so you can carry it around. Video quality was excellent. I wish they had units this affordable when I had kids. We just had little one way sound monitors and even then those were expensive.</p>

<h5 id="the-first-one-did-not-work-well-the-company">The first one did not work well. The company &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one did not work well. The company worked with us and replaced it in record time. We are please with the new monitor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-baby-monitor-does-it-s-job">This baby monitor does it&rsquo;s job!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We just needed a basic baby monitor. This item does exactly what we expect it to do. The price is pretty affordable too. I would definetely recommend this to any parent who just want the basic functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-a-life-saver">This thing is a life saver!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, being a parent is tough! Thank God for technology! When you are always trying to do a million things at once, that is when a product like this comes in handy. I am so glad I bought this. I can check on my child when they are napping or after we put them to bed for the night without having to run back up stairs. I can keep working on laundry or making dinner or sitting on the couch watching some TV! What&rsquo;s great is that this alerts me if my child is crying in case I don&rsquo;t hear them. Video quality is good too and it works exactly as advertised. I can&rsquo;t ask for much more. All I can say is get it!</p>

<h5 id="a-really-nice-little-monitor">A really nice little monitor.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Being a grandparent it is always a bit worrisome when you have your grandson alone with you in a big house. I have been putting him to sleep on the sofa so that I could keep an eye on him. He is nearly two years old now and I would much prefer him sleeping in his crib or on a bed. I got this Safesky baby monitor so that I could put him to sleep upstairs in a bed and still be able to keep an eye on him.We often sit outside on warm summer evenings and we will still be able to do that while our grandson is here now that we are able to see and hear him in his room.This monitor is a simple plug and play unit. The camera portion is already synced with the receiver so when you plug them in and turn them on you have instant reception. If for any reason they are not paired, there are detailed instructions on how to manually pair them.The picture quality on this baby monitor is quite good, there is a bit of a lag with movement on the video but it is not too bad. The sound is very good.Having the option to play music is nice, a lot of children like to hear music while falling asleep it helps them to not feel like they are alone. The voice function also helps with that.The VOX feature is great for saving power and as another reviewer said, to avoid having the parent unit lit up all the time.This monitor has date and time settings and also an alarm function. When it is time for baby to be woken up, the alarm can be set to remind you to do so, avoiding the child sleeping for too long during the day.You are able to raise and lower the volume on the monitor to suit your needs and it will also tell you the temperature in babies room.This is a lightweight set that is easy to carry around and can be set up just about anywhere. Both parent and baby units come with very long power cords. and them baby unit can be mounted on the wall if you want to.I set the baby unit up facing my aquarium so I could show you how it picks up video. It is a bit choppy but it is quite clear and definitely good enough for monitoring a child. Videos submitted to Amazon are hit and miss as far as the quality after being processed so I hope this one turns out good enough for you to get an idea of the picture quality.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="a-real-review-in-a-sea-of-fakes">A REAL review in a sea of fakes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of all of these fake reviews on all the baby monitors sold on Amazon. This is the THIRD different brand I have purchased and it&rsquo;s the worst yet! I received it today and had it processed for return before my son even fell asleep! Horrible picture quality. VOX feature does not work consistently. Feels super lightweight and cheap. It&rsquo;s really not very user-friendly to set time and date&hellip;one of those where you can&rsquo;t tell which button does what. You can&rsquo;t switch the screen off and leave just the audio on. The temperature reading is inaccurate. So basically there is nothing good to say about this other than the fact it is cheap. Well, you get what you pay for! And please keep in mind if you are shopping for one of these monitors, do not trust all of these glowing reviews. It&rsquo;s total BS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-and-set-up">Easy to install and set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I was looking for. Easy to install and set up</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We received our monitor and loved a lot of the features. The range is great! Our old monitor was constantly losing signal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-volume-is-pretty-loud-even-on-the-lowest-setting">The volume is pretty loud even on the lowest setting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I replaced a broken Summer infant monitor with this. I wanted something cheap since I won&rsquo;t need it too much longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-super-cute-baby-monitor">This is a super cute baby monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a super cute baby monitor! A lot of people would use security cameras but they look ugly in baby&rsquo;s room compared to this one and baby monitors have a lot of advantages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-monitor-especially-at-night">Perfect monitor, especially at night</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect monitor, especially at night! I had a trouble with it, but the customer service was so helpful to resolve it quickly.</p>
