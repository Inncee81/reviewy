<h5 id="perfect-small-bag-for-micro-four-thirds-cameras">Perfect Small Bag For Micro Four-Thirds Cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a small bag for my MFT camera that offered strong protection. The Case Logic SLRC-202 was exactly what I wanted. It&rsquo;s big enough to hold my camera and medium-length lens comfortably. The suspension system adds an extra level or protection beyond the padding. The camera is easily accessible for quick shots. There are enough side pockets for an extra lens, lens covers, an extra battery, and a battery charger. For what I was looking for, it&rsquo;s perfect. While it&rsquo;s find for MFT, I can see it being too small for people with full-frame cameras and larger lenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-compact-bag">Nice Compact Bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The SLRC-202 camera bag is a nice, compact bag to store equipment and travel lean. It holds my D5100 with 55-200mm attached, 18-55mm lens, battery charger, shoulder strap, Giottos AA1920 Rocket Air Blaster Small (Black), LensPen, and a few other small accessories. I should be able to fit my 35mm f/1.8G AF-S lens as well, once received. However, if I had one of the small lens attached to camera and 55-200mm stored, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d put the 3rd lens.The hammock system works great, as the D5100 w/ 55-200mm lens attached measures roughly 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches in length. It leaves about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch below lens to inside bottom of bag and about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch from back of D5100 body to top of bag&hellip;meaning, you could probably fit a larger camera body with ease. You may also be able to fit it with a longer lens (such as 55-300mm), but it would probably be a tight fit with the 55-300mm lens touching the bottom of the bag, defeating the primary purpose of the hammock system.This bag was hanging on wall while doing review and I accidentally knocked it off the wall hook when measuring for this review! With the top flap open (camera exposed), the bag landed on its base and camera stayed contained in hammock system. What great protection!</p>

<h5 id="case-logic-slrc-202-medium-slr-camera-bag">Case Logic SLRC-202 Medium SLR Camera Bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fine camera bag. The medium size is a perfect fit for our Nikon D5600 Kit. Holds/suspends the camera with either lens attached facing down. The other lens goes in either of the side pockets. That leaves the other side pocket available for another lens or a 2X extender. Battery charger goes in the front pocket. The bottom is well padded. This seems like a well thought out, quality manufactured bag. My wife had previous experience with Case Logic bags and is happy with their products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-fit-even-for-slightly-larger-lens">Good fit even for slightly larger lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought Case Logic product before for a small point and shoot camera and was very satisfied. This time I needed a bag for NIKON D7100 and 70-200 F4 lens. This bag&rsquo;s pocket sizes are just a tad smaller than the lens but I still wanted to try. I found that the 70-200 lens fits just fine into the side pocket and its hood and the charger go into the pocket on the opposite side. The front pocket is OK for some cleaning supplies, remote and extra memory. Overall this is a tight fit but every piece has its place and does not interfere with others. I love this bag because I can simply put it inside my backpack along with other staff such as monopod, binoculars, books, water bottle, etc. and I do not need to carry this as a separate item at the airplane boarding. Once I arrive at the destination I can pull it out and carry outside if I choose to do so, or still keep it inside my backpack if I prefer not to attract attention to expensive photo equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="narrower-then-i-thought-it-would-be">Narrower then I thought it would be.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like the title says it&rsquo;s a little narrower than I thought it would because my Sony a77 barely fits in it but my canon t3i fits perfectly. So if you have a camera that&rsquo;s not consumer size like the smaller Nikon&rsquo;s or Canon you might have trouble fitting your camera in here and might want to get the Case Logic SLRC-203 which is the one I wish I had bought in the first place. My external flash fits in the side pocket and and narrow kit lens will also just don&rsquo;t expect to fit anything that has a front glass element bigger then 58mm. The hammocks middle slot wont fit anything bigger then a kit or prime lens so don&rsquo;t expect to be putting anything bigger then 58mm also. The build quality is awesome and I own the Case Logic SLRC-206 so I didn&rsquo;t see the need for the larger SLRC-203 little did I know. You&rsquo;re probably wondering why the 5 stars? It&rsquo;s built very well, there&rsquo;s sufficient pocket space and even a sly pocket below the padded part that faces you. The water proof bottom is really sturdy just a little narrow so be careful when placing it down. I personally think the bottom should be wider so it doesn&rsquo;t fall over as easy, then again that goes for my original complaint that the top isn&rsquo;t wide enough for my gear so I just hope the SLRC-203 is and that it&rsquo;s not so top heavy also. All in all I&rsquo;d give it 4.5 stars so I just rounded up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-only-it-were-a-bit-bigger-updated">If only it were a bit bigger. (Updated)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have given this bag a higher rating except that I was a little surprised by how small it is. My Nikon D7000 barely fits in it, but only if I remove the camera&rsquo;s neck strap, and the side pockets are a snug fit for my smaller zoom lenses without their shades. It is, however, well-constructed, sturdy and light; the design is very attractive; and there&rsquo;s room enough for such things as extra memory cards and batteries. I am keeping it as I am considering a mirrorless system that should fit nicely in this bag.9/05/16. I have been using this bag with my D3200 and Sigma 18-250mm f:3.5 - 6.3 and a wrist strap rather than a neck strap. It has worked out well. After a month of use a defect became apparent - the stitching that secured one to the shoulder strap loops came partially undone. I contacted Case Logic and, after providing proof of purchase and a couple of images of the defect, I had a replacement bag in less than a week. Their customer service is first rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sturdy-product-with-a-lot-of-space">Great sturdy product with a lot of space</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love this pack. It&rsquo;s sturdy. Plus, it fits my Canon 70D, two lens, my GoPro with a couple little accessories. It definitely helps protect the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="large-capacity-bag-for-mft-systems">Large capacity bag for MFT systems</h5>

<p>I wanted a case with a separate compartment for the lenses to reduce the likelihood that I would drop them when I pull out the camera.</p>
