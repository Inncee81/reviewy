<h5 id="i-was-very-pleased-with-the-initial-performance-and-appearance">I was very pleased with the initial performance and appearance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stopped working after two weeks.I bought four of these panels and received well packed packages. I was very pleased with the initial performance and appearance. They worked well at first but two panels stopped working after only two weeks. I found that there were bubbles at the front of the panels and burnt marks at the back of the panels. I do not know what is going on, but obviously this is a manufacturing defect.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Placed it on top of my SUV to run evaporation cooling fans and charge my jump-start battery while idle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-my-purchase">Happy with my purchase&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>90W peak so far! That&rsquo;s not what I was expecting. Many people expect (rightfully so) that a 100W panel will product 100W, but that&rsquo;s only under IDEAL conditions aka testing lab. I purchase this to charge my DIY solar generator and measured output via my &ldquo;Watt&rsquo;s Up&rdquo; meter. I purchased based on reviews and wanted to add mine to the mix. The build quality is spot from my perspective. Packaging was excellent with multiple layers of padding/cardboard. I included several photos. The one shows the output of the panel that the generator is demanding. It was around 25W since the battery is almost fully charged. I added the fan to add a 10W load which it easily handled.If you want to find out more information about the DIY solar generator projects, search Google with my last name and the word solar. There&rsquo;s videos and a blog that show you have to make one for yourself.</p>

<h5 id="quality-of-packing-was-excellent-3-boxes-layered-in-side-of-each-other">Quality of packing was excellent (3 boxes layered in side of each other)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well constructed unit. Using it as a way to keep batteries topped off on a 38 foot sailboat. Quality of packing was excellent (3 boxes layered in side of each other). Unit is SOLID and works very well. I have this coupled with a Victron controller with the Bluetooth dongle that gives me a live readout and charging history of the panel. This Panel consistently shows 48W charging (depending on sun angle). For those wondering about amps..I will consistently see 2.7 to 3 amps charging on my Blue Seas M Series Battery Monitor in full sun. Although I have only had the panel for 2 weeks, I feel comfortable giving this panel a 5 star rating. Its been excellent.I attached a photo of my Blue Tooth Victron App showing one particular day of a 40W Charging Cycle and corresponding Amp Values.</p>

<h5 id="well-made-panel-great-customer-service">Well made panel, great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this panel to charge the aux battery in my Vanagon so I can run my ARB fridge when out camping. Plan to store it in the upper bunk section. Decided this might work better than some of the fold able hard panel offerings out there. Received the first one but it didn&rsquo;t test out to specs. Wouldn&rsquo;t even get half way there. Zero amp output with overcast skies, which won&rsquo;t cut it here in the Pacific NW. Great customer service, very responsive and truly wanted to make sure I was happy with my purchase. They worked with me to figure out what was wrong but nothing proved fruitful so they told me to send it back, no cost, and try a replacement. The replacement arrived and this time checked out within spec, so good to go. Love the construction, seems well made and should stand up to the weather here well.</p>

<h5 id="solar-charging-computers-and-cell-phones-off-the-grid">Solar Charging Computers and Cell Phones off the Grid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To afford to take a recent 3-week vacation, I needed to write my latest book “Infinite Universe Theory” on rainy days not amenable to outdoor activity. So I set up this kit to charge my laptop, two cell phones, and three GPS devices. I purchased the following:1. 12V 35 ah deep cell battery and cable2. 50W solar panel3. 50 ft solar panel wire4. Solar controller with USB outlets and 12V load5. Two 12V cigarette lighter sockets6. 12V charger for the laptop7. Trickle chargers to keep the deep cell battery charged while in storageAll of these devices worked wonderfully. The solar panel worked as long as it was light out. The battery came fully charged at 12.6V and never got below 12V during the whole three weeks. I cut the solar panel wire in half to be able to put the panel 25’ outside the tent (I buried the wire to avoid tripping). The batter y cable was too big and had to be stripped down, so I recommend 10 Ga as the maximum. It would be good to solder the ends of the wires or add connectors to fit the solar controller, which was excellent except for the connections. Total cost was a bit over $200, and well worth it.</p>

<h5 id="this-one-is-great">This one is great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally new to solar and still need to do some further testing but so far I am very happy with this panel! I&rsquo;m using an ARB freezer while camping which averages 2ah to run. I&rsquo;m on a very old battery and freezer would bring battery low during the night ~11.7v and then the sun would come up and in about 4 or 5 hours I was back at 13.2v (including still running the freezer). During the day it seemed to run the freezer completely on its own. Soon I will hook up an ammeter and see exactly how much energy it is generating.Seems very well built and durable. I like that it is semi flexible and the kind that does not care if shadows hit a couple cells.Also, I searched high and low and read reviews on many others. This was one of my top contenders and so far I am happy!</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-product-at-a-good-price">This is a great product at a good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product at a good price. I have two of these panels and would recommend them to anyone. Suaoki is a great company to work with and they are very responsive to inquiries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk-lasted-two-months">Junk! Lasted two months!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These panels gave up in less than 2 months.They worked great for a while but the connectors are really cheap and will break easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love It!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We installed this on our van, attaching it to a dual battery charger. One lead goes to the van&rsquo;s battery, the other to our camper&rsquo;s battery.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-power-output-as-expected">Works well, power output as expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had these mounted on my van for a couple of months now and they&rsquo;re working great.They have had no problem keeping my 12v/100Ah battery charged, even during days&hellip;</p>
