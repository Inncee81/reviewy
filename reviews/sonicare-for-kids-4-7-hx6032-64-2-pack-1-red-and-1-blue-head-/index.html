<h5 id="perfect-size-for-little-ones">Perfect Size for Little Ones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 6 year old daughter has been using the Sonicare toothbrush since she was 4 years old, and she loves it! I buy these replacement heads specifically for ages 4-7 because they are the perfect size for her little mouth. Even though my daughter will be seven in a few months I plan on using this size for at least another year. They come in two colors, light blue and red. The length of the brush head from base to top is about 2 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches long and the head itself is just over .5 inches.Once when I ran out of this size replacement heads I used the size up, (the one for ages 7-10) and immediately noticed the difference. That size head is significantly longer (closer to the length of the replacement heads for adults) and is much harder for little ones to control. As a matter of fact, my daughter did such a poor job of using the toothbrush with the longer head that my husband and I had to brush her teeth for her. Now I make sure to always have a replacement head on hand for whenever needed. I buy them through Amazon&rsquo;s subscribe and save so I never run out.I would highly recommend getting this size replacement brush head for any little ones who uses the Sonicare toothbrush. FYI these replacement heads also fit, and work with, the adult toothbrush. So, you could just buy the heads for your little one and use with your own Sonicare&hellip;..the kids&rsquo; toothbrush is about the same length as the adult one, (the actual toothbrush not the head) only a bit chunkier so kids should be able to manipulate the adult Sonicare as easily as they would the kids.[Update 8/26/14] Since I wrote this review, Amazon has removed this item from its subscribe and save program. They have substituted Philips Sonicare HX6032/94 2 Piece Kids Brush Head, Compact (Colors May Vary), which is pretty much exactly the same as this product, except that both replacement heads in the package are light blue. It&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer for me, as I liked the idea of having each child with a different color, but such is life. I see this product now sells for close to $50, which is completely crazy!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My son has had problems with staining since he was 2 years old. This toothbrush was recommended by his pediatric dentist and cleaned his teeth very well. It reduced the surface staining of my son&rsquo;s teeth by many fold. It beeps in 30 sec intervals so we know exactly when to switch sides. At the 4th beep/2 min mark, the toothbrush turns off automatically so we&rsquo;re always brushing for the right amount of time. My son is 5 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years old now and we&rsquo;re still using the same toothbrush. My only problem is the price of the replacement heads, hence 4 stars rather than 5. But I guess that&rsquo;s a worthwhile investment compared to the alternative.</p>

<h5 id="do-yourself-a-favor-and-buy-part-number-hx6032-94-for-half-as-much">Do yourself a favor and buy part number HX6032/94 for half as much.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy part number HX6032/94 (mini or &ldquo;4to7&rdquo;. These are the smaller ones) for half as much. I believe this part number is becoming obsolete and the current cost is double the MSRP. These tooth brush heads and the toothbrushes themselves are very nice and work well. They are teaching my kids how long to brush which is nice when people feel rushed and want to cut short an important daily personal hygiene.</p>

<h5 id="work-well-for-a-3-year-old">Work well for a 3-year old&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our 3½ year old son has been using a Sonicare with the standard small adult brush head for about a year. He got used to it quickly, but had some difficulty with keeping the hard plastic from contacting his teeth. If you&rsquo;re already a Sonicare user, you know what a &ldquo;shock&rdquo; this can transmit into your skull (my wife had the same complaint when we first got the Sonicare, and she because of that she stayed away from it for a long time).Although that small adult brush head was working well enough, when I found these for replacement, I figured they&rsquo;d be worth a shot. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, this soft outer skin maybe ought to be standard on all of their brush heads.It&rsquo;s just a simple rubbery coating, but when it contacts the teeth, the instant zap of vibration just isn&rsquo;t there. The brush heads themselves look to be about the same size as the standard small adult brush heads, though the overall length of each attachment is perhaps a half inch shorter, making these just a bit easier to handle for small kids.We continue to use both Oral B and Sonicare in our house, but since we&rsquo;ve switched our oldest to these heads, he reaches for the Sonicare every time.</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-wait">Worth the wait</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for kids. Both my 4 and 2 year olds brush daily and have no cavities. My sister claims that it really is the owner of the brush that makes the difference between a person having cavities or not, but I can definitely say that it helps that this brush does the brushing for you. I really just have to direct/maneuver the brush to each tooth and it vibrates enough to clean each tooth. Worth the extra effort to find the small brush heads at Amazon and wait for them to be delivered as I could NOT find them in they stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="replacement-brushes">Replacement Brushes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Once my kids were only enough I immediately switched them over to Sonicare kids toothbrushes. They definitely work much better than the other kids rotating toothbrushes. Since my kids are younger they still chew on the head sometimes which wears them out a bit quicker. This makes it a bit more expensive to replace. But still worth it knowing that with has much vibration the Sonicare toothbrush puts out it even if they shortened their brushing they are still getting much more in than using just a regular rotating brush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tooth-fairy-approved">Tooth fairy approved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a gift from the tooth fairy. The actual brush heads had to be special ordered - the smaller heads (for 2 kids) because most stores only carry the 7+ sized heads. I&rsquo;m a teeth freak. I guess I&rsquo;m reviewing the brush (even though I didn&rsquo;t purchase it thru amazon) and the heads. The brush is the bomb. Once you get the kids used to the vibration - mine laughed hysterically for the first week I used it with them. I would recommend the smaller brush heads for any kid regardless of age just because they actually fit in their little mouths all the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-them-don-t-fit-right">Don&rsquo;t buy them - don&rsquo;t fit right.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Philips kids sonicare line is a joke. You can&rsquo;t find these heads in any store so you&rsquo;re forced to buy online. These don&rsquo;t fit the brush like the originals do so they vibrate off while in use.A terrible waste of money - the brush and the heads.</p>
