<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-quadcopter">Good Quadcopter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying that this little quadcopter is smaller than I thought it would be. But other than that, I love it! Regardless of what others may have written, I can fly this quad in strong winds. Yes, it gets blown around because it&rsquo;s light, but as long as you put it in high rate it can handle whatever is thrown at it. I&rsquo;m talking about 15+mph winds. It takes more skill than a beginner, but that&rsquo;s not the point, the point is that the quad has the power to fly in the wind.Camera is better than I thought, and it flies about 7 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> minutes before the low voltage kicks in. This is on the standard 500 mAh battery that came with it.Now for the bad: When it reaches low voltage, it starts descending almost immediately. Doesn&rsquo;t give you enough time to fly it back to you, SO YOU BETTER USE A TIMER. Also, when it hits the ground, the motors keep turning for about 5 seconds before it shuts off.In summary:GOOD:1. Hovers great, easy to fly2. Good camera (no it&rsquo;s not professional quality, but its very clear)3. Can be flown outdoors, even in the wind with enough skill.4. Batteries fairly inexpensive and easy to find.5. Video and still pictures can be activated and taken from button on remote.6. Two rates. Both are very stable7. Can be flown indoorsBAD:1. Low voltage shutdown doesn&rsquo;t give you much time to fly back to you. It starts descending almost immediately. USE A TIMER!2. Motors keep spinning for about 5 seconds once it descends from low voltage shutdown, even with the throttle stick down.3. Light weight, gets blown around in strong winds. Can be flown in strong winds, but needs pilot skill.Overall I would recommend this quad to any beginner and intermediate pilot. Buy it, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="enhanced-version-is-actually-worse-in-most-respects-than-prior-version-horrible-video-quality">Enhanced version is actually worse in most respects than prior version; horrible video quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my fifth drone. I had a couple of the older version of this before and a Parrot. Despite their claims, this is NOT an upgrade from the last version. The flight qualities are essentially unchanged (and are great). The only things that have changed are things that have been made worse.First, the low battery indicator comes on WAY too late to do anything about. It basically starts flashing the lights, and then a couple seconds later you crash land. Unless you were at very low altitude when the low battery flashing warning happens, you&rsquo;re going to crash.Second, the video quality is HORRIBLE. I know this is a bad thing to say, but I am so sick of the blatant dishonesty of so many Chinese companies. They advertise this as HD video, but it&rsquo;s actually VGA video that has been processed up to 720 using a horrible algorithm, making it lower quality than if they&rsquo;d just left it VGA. Check out the pictures I included for what I&rsquo;m talking about. The videos look like they were processed with some cheap Photoshop oil paint filter. It&rsquo;s mathematically impossible to gain resolution through processing, so all they are doing is degrading the quality of the video.Third, the video is also not compressed using a proper codec like MPEG. It&rsquo;s actually Motion JPEG, which means the videos are huge. You&rsquo;ll have to recompress them using a proper codec to get them down to size, but you&rsquo;ll suffer the usual quality loss inherent to transcoding between lossy formats.Lastly, the battery they include is smaller than in prior iterations of this product I&rsquo;ve purchased. In the past a 600+ mAh battery was included. This drone includes a thinner 500 mph battery.In all, I can&rsquo;t recommend this drone. Look for one of the older versions for a similar or lower price. You&rsquo;ll actually be getting a better drone.</p>

<h5 id="a-fun-toy">A fun toy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For a toy-class quadcopter/drone (*not really a drone) it is pretty good and a lot of fun. As the unit is quite light any action you apply with the remote is sudden so take care when flying it indoors because any moves you make are more likely to be more than you wanted and it is very easy to over-correct.Flying outdoors is fine but is best reserved for still air or very light breeze at most, because the unit is so light the wind will take it. I&rsquo;ve had to climb trees on numerous occasions to retrieve it after a slight gust took it. Also, range is somewhat limited (the antannae leads are not tuned properly), but can be greatly extended if you&rsquo;re familiar with electronics repair or building; simply trim or extend the lead to 31.25mm (or multiples thereof) including the length of the solder pad in both the remote and the drone, and you will be able to extend the range a good amount. I&rsquo;ve been able to get this copter up hundreds of feet - higher than the flight path of KC-135s and C-5Bs when they make low passes (although when I see them coming I kill power and let the drone drop).Don&rsquo;t expect a long life out of the motors though; the motors in this unit will wear out within a few hours&rsquo; use but they are easy enough to replace if you possess basic soldering skills and they&rsquo;re readily available here on Amazon and elsewhere.It&rsquo;s a good project to mod - by cutting out some of the extra stiffening ribs, taking off the camera and battery cover, removing the landing stalks, propeller guards, etc. you can hugely improve performance, climb rate, roll rate, and run time, but at expense of making the unit more vulnerable to damage. There are even motor upgrades available for this unit so it&rsquo;s a good starting point if you want a copter to mod but not build one from scratch.Camera quality: HA! It&rsquo;s a toy. Okay, it&rsquo;s not as bad as you would expect from a ~$50 toy, but&hellip; dynamic range stinks, the image isn&rsquo;t sharp, the cheapest GoPro clone you can find will easily deliver a better image than this camera. BUT: it is fun.&mdash;-Given the performance and fun for the price, I give this quadcopter 5 stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This quadcopter, in several ways, is better than the AR Drone 2.0 I got a couple of years ago. Really light but stable. Easily controllable. Takes video. And, at about $45 I&rsquo;m not as concerned about smashing into things like with the AR. (And I do. Smash into things. Cause I&rsquo;m klutzy. And Old. And trees (and my house) have a habit of suddenly appearing in my air space.)</p>

<p>Got this for my 10 year old nephew. He was so thrilled to receive it! It took some time before he got the hang of it but after a few attempts he had it hovering around!</p>

<p> This thing is ridiculously durable. It lost connection I would say 100 feet in the air, fell and survived. Too bad I got it stuck in a tree :(Customer Video Review</p>
