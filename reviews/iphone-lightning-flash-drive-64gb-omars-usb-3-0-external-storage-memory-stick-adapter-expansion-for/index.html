More tips while using</p>

<p>If you can’t transfer your photos from iCloud to Omars memory stick, don’t worry. This problem only occurs when your iCloud is set to “optimize iPhone storage”.  
change the setting to “Download and keep originals”. All the photos taken from onwards will appear in WitStick’s “Album” section. However, the photos that had been uploaded to iCloud can only be transferred to the memory stick by a computer.
Other than using a computer to transfer videos, Witstick offers a quick access to all self-shooting videos that are saved in your Album. A few simple clicks transfer your videos in seconds. Due to iOS system&rsquo;s protacol, Witstick cannot access videos in other applications directly. You can send files via email and transfer the attachment to Witstick.
Music that are downloaded from iTunes cannot be accessed from Witstick because it is copy-right protected. We respect artists&rsquo; owenership and we won&rsquo;t risk violating relavant laws and regulations. </p>

<h5 id="love-it-super-easy-despite-a-couple-of-translation-glitches-and-my-product-of-the-year">Love it, super easy (despite a couple of translation glitches) and my product of the year!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After having gone through issues with a relative who doesn&rsquo;t have a computer it was clear there had to be a better solution to save both contacts and pictures, possibly music but the latter can usually be recovered easily. I&rsquo;ve looked at the different options and based on the reviews and price settled for this one. My comment: search no further:You plug it in, install the app, follow the instructions to format the drive (very easy and fast) and then you back up your contacts and your pictures/videos as the first step.- you can backup your contacts to the drive and restore them from there if you need to (or copy those to your computer or other hard drive)- you can move pictures from your computer to the drive and from the drive into the phone which is a real pain if you don&rsquo;t have a computer otherwise- you can move pictures from your phone to your drive and from there anywhere you like so you can free up valuable space on your phone (yes we all take 10 pictures of the same thing but really only want to show one of them off later maybe but it&rsquo;s hard to delete anything in today&rsquo;s photo hoarding culture). Keep the one you love and save them all to your drive and delete them off the phoneIt took about 1.5 hours for approximately 8430 pictures and videos to save to the drive so it&rsquo;s not the fastest speed you&rsquo;ve ever seen but it&rsquo;s safe they all play and view after the copy (at least all the samples I checked) directly from the drive.Thumbs up and I know what I&rsquo;ll give for Christmas presents this year!!!</p>

<h5 id="not-as-simple-and-easy-as-advertised">Not as simple and easy as advertised !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product arrived yesterday and I found the instructions to be obtuse and of little help in doing what I wanted it to do which is providing an easy means of saving images from my wife&rsquo;s iPad in order to reduce the amount of memory required on her iPad. At this point, I have not been able to accomplish my objective and can only hope that my son will be able to show me the way when he returns from a holiday visit with his in-laws. I will do my best to update this review at such time, and if we can determine how to accomplish our objectives easily. Otherwise, it might well be returned.Update:Omars Direct was kind enough to send me a link to a video that showed how to use the device with an iPhone and I have now been able to transfer images from the iPhone and iPad to the device. However, when I plug the USB plug on the device into my iMac and open the file, it doesn&rsquo;t show any contents and what I really wanted the device to do was to store photos from the iPad and and iPhone in order to be able to transfer them to the iMac. At this point I am not able to accomplish this but have written them via Amazon and hope that they will be able to point me in the right direction. There is no WitStick app on the OS X App Store but I&rsquo;m not at all sure that is the problem. Now I&rsquo;m just waiting and hoping to get a helpful response from Omars.I have upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars based upon the fact that I finally figured out how to make the drive work in the manner I had expected and am now able to take photos from my phones and iPad and either store them on the drive to increase memory space on the devices and to view them on my iMac. This &ldquo;learning&rdquo; came about from reading another review on Amazon&rsquo;s site, not from any specific assistance provided by Omars, though, it has to be said, they have been very responsive to my inquiries. If not for the fact that it required extensive effort on my part to get the device to function as advertised, I would probably rate it 5 stars, but I felt their instructions were inadequate for a non-techie like me when a very specific, 5 - 7 steps, simple operating procedure would have done the job. The other thing is that the instructions are provided in such a small font that I needed a magnifying glass to read and that was incredibly frustrating. It seems to be a good product and could be rated higher but for the issues I mentioned.</p>

<h5 id="the-directions-provided-are-nice-and-detailed-which-was-a-nice-plus">The directions provided are nice and detailed which was a nice plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a review of the oMars 3.0 USB Flash Drive with Lightning Connector.(Measures 32mm x 20mm x 9mm)I will first begin with my summary based on use and then the pros and cons I considered for this review.Summary - I have used several different jump drives which incorporate USB and Lightning connectors and this one is proving to be very reliable and fast. If you use both pc and iphone products, this is a must have to move files back and forth and also gives you the ability to add to your fixed storage on an iphone which always seems to be too running out.As with every single type of flash drive I have tried, the software (app) you need to install on you iphone is not the easiest to use or navigate. The directions provided are nice and detailed which was a nice plus, but the app itself is just a little cumbersome and requires you to jump between menus and settings to get what you need to done. I really cannot blame the drive though as these types of jump drives rely on apps needed due to iphone system structure and security. There really is no way around using the apps that come with the drives to get what you need to do. The Witstick app provided does allow you to backup contacts-recover them and save-load videos and music.Putting this aside, if this is used on a computer, the USB 3.0 is nice and fast. USB 3.0 will always be slightly faster than lightning connector for these type of drives. This shows up as a 29.9gb drive as there are files on this pre-loaded for operation.Pros-Unlike a lot of other devices I have tried, this one is actually Apple MFI certified (which means this is guaranteed to work even if your Apple device gets an upgrade).-This has nice solid connections and is plug and play for both PC as well as your Android. (Android use requires a little usb OTG adapter you can get for a buck or so.) When you plug this into the Apple device for the first time, you will be directed to the applestore to download the app it requires called Witstick which is free. (Manual has a lot of detail regarding the use of this app.)-Speeds where close to spot on as rated. Around 35mb/s read and 15mb/s write on IOS and 80mb/s read and 35mb/s write on pc. (The speeds seemed to be lower when I tried to transfer large physical files – videos but if you are doing contacts-small docs or pictures, you get the higher speeds.-Supports almost all of the major formats.Photos – BMP, GIF, CUR, ICO, JPG, PNG, TIF, TIFF, XBM.Video – M4V, MP4, MPV, AVI, FLV, MKV, MOV, MPG, RM, RMVB, TS, WMV.Music – WAV, AAC, AIFF, AIF, CAF, M4A, MP3.Documents – XLS, PPT, PDF, TXT, DOC.Cons-I had no way to attach a lanyard for carrying this.-While app is free and does work, it is a little cumbersome to work with and requires practice to get used to it.-File transfers did not fully reach advertised speeds but came within 8mb/s of stated speed pending what was being transferred.I don’t know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.Please note I have no relationship with this seller. I did receive this free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. I take my reviews serious and will only provide my true feedback. Thank you!</p>
