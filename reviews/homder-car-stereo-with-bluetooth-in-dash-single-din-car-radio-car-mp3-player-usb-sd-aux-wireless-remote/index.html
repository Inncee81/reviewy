<h5 id="great-light-weight-easy-to-install-bluetooth-car-stereo-on-a-budget">Great light weight easy to install bluetooth car stereo on a budget.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I create portable stereos for Different people. Some are the beach and some for off grid living. One of my issues is compact size. This unit blew me away with the size. The deck its self is normal standard size but the depth is nearly one third the size. One thing to Note is this is a very light weight unit. It can do most of the standard powering. It can handle bass and subs very well on its won but it doesn&rsquo;t have the strength to go all out.This would make a great starter deck or a fast replacement for an old car that needed an upgrade. For this cost you cant beat it. This latest project i call stereo in a box. Its a chest with mounted speakers, solar panels, car deck, solar charger with outputs for external speakers aka subs. There is more to it than that but i needed a stereo.The quality of audio on these even hooked up to 2 flat screen TV speakers sounds wonderful. Perfect bass i tested each speaker line. One thing to note there is no custom EQ and the presets are not that great the classical and Rock seem sot be the only usable settings rest not so much if at all.The Bluetooth setting linked to my phone within seconds and it remembered my phone so i didn&rsquo;t have to connect each time i turned the car on. The aux port was a bit stiff plugin in but i have had head units that needed a break in. The display is bright and clear. the key buttons light up and the configuration for the presets are easy to set with a simple press and hold.The wires are as basic and simple as they come. Some times its confusing what color is what they mark it with numbers and show pictures as to what position each number is. What i like is they grouped them front left front right rear left rear right so its really easy to know which is which if your new to this. This deck also has very minimal battery drain. i had it playing off a small 12 volt battery for roughly 6 hours and barely scratched the bank.I&rsquo;m not a car guy so i cant really tell you much more than this. Its basic its well made and very lightweight. If you want something simple to install and replace and old unit with a nice look this is for you. All in all i like it and this is going in my list of company&rsquo;s to buy from for my next builds. If anything changes i will let you know till than have a great day.</p>

<h5 id="lots-of-features-for-an-inexpensive-car-stereo-with-good-sound-quality">Lots of features for an inexpensive car stereo with good sound quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of features for an inexpensive car stereo with good sound quality. Displays well with bright &amp; large numbers on the digital clock display.This is really upgraded technology for me to have a car stereo compatible with my iPhone (also works with Androids).Supports SCD, USB charge &amp; MP3 players. Has built in Bluetooth &amp; microphone so I can make hand free calls with Siri &amp; get Bluetooth music.18 radio stations can be programmed in the memory. It comes with a wireless remote which I have to remind myself to put in a designated spot as it is small &amp; thin remote that could get misplaced.I really thought I was going to have some issues with the sound quality being static noise sound or not coming in clearly or the bass quality not being good but am impressed with the quality.It&rsquo;s lightweight &amp; looks normal looking from the front but turn it to the side &amp; the depth of it is a fraction of normal size.White buttons for mode (forward/back), EQ (band - type of music pop,classic, rock) (clock - short press to display &amp; long press to beat display) short press to hang up phone &amp; mute (phone) short press to mute on/off &amp; you don&rsquo;t get audio in mute mode. At the bottom are the 6 buttons for 1) memory playback, 2) memory for radio control playback of track, 3) memory track repeat mode, 4) memory random mode of tracks, 5) memory short press - 10 long press to choose folder, 6) memory press to +10 &amp; long press to folder. Volume control on knob. SD - card slotAux in jack to listen to portable player. I really am not used to having as much stuff on stereo so it&rsquo;s a bit overwhelming at first to figure it all out.Please note that I am no expert in installing car stereos so I did see that it says in listing to consult with a professional.There is a lot of information in the instructions &amp; the mounting plus some of the other information was really over my head.It does breakdown into location of control, features, operating instructions, specifications, remote control description, installation precautions, maintenance &amp; wiring diagram. The wires are color coded but would not be able to figure all this mess out between wiring &amp; mounting.I just enjoy the results after it&rsquo;s been installed &amp; would recommend you follow precautions including not using higher amperage than recommended.The only thing in my opinion the silver knob looks a bit cheaper like it&rsquo;s plastic but am sure silver is used to make the knob stand out &amp; also to look neutral in vehicles. The sound quality &amp; features for the price you pay for it is well worth it.</p>

<h5 id="great-stereo-for-the-price">Great stereo for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good stereo. Considering the price, it&rsquo;s great value. You&rsquo;re getting features of a $80 stereo, all for less than $30. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this had Bluetooth so you can stream music wirelessly. I was surprised about how small this unit is compared to all the other stereos I&rsquo;ve had. Must be since there is no CD option which is why they&rsquo;re able to make this unit so small. Here are my thoughts to this-Pros:-price-works-many features like bluetooth, Usb and Aux- size-remoteCon&ndash;For my preference it&rsquo;s too light, makes me worry about long term use-no detachable face plate, it remains attached. Safety concern of mine.- remote control sometime doesn&rsquo;t work, no biggie for me since i forget I have oneAgain, don&rsquo;t expect this to perform like a $200 stereo. You get many features but it has it&rsquo;s limitations. Just know that you&rsquo;re getting a $30 stereo and with that in mind you won&rsquo;t be disappointed</p>

<h5 id="car-stereo-with-bluetooth">Car Stereo With Bluetooth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical of the radio at first because of the price then when it came it was smaller than normal ones but after being hooked up it is great!! Everything works great on it. I am glad I purchased this radio I am fully satisfied with it。This Car Stereo With Bluetooth is very nice. Its made well, and comes with everything you need to easily install. The Car Stereo does come with a Remote, and Instructions. Bluetooth is very popular now in all vehicles so this is a perfect item to have.</p>
