<h5 id="best-tablet-accessory-they-make">Best tablet accessory they make.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve been using this for about a month for about 5 days a week, 6 to 8 hours a day, and once in a blue weekend. I also tend to use PCs between 12 and 16 hours a day, so I am used to typing A LOT and prefer a comfortable keyboard.In terms of typing on a keyboard, I would like a little more more size to the keys but it is actually far better than most laptops that I have seen in recent years. Not as comfortable to use as my Logitech K810 but much less likely to lose a darn key someday, yet not as &ldquo;Flat&rdquo; as the Zagg keyboard dock. Key travel feels quite nice and you can really feel it when typing at a decent rate (I probably type 60~80 wpm depending on details), could be better but gets the job done. There is nothing to belly ache about typing on this keyboard unless you want a numpad &ndash; at 12.2&rdquo; it is physically large as a full sized desktop keyboard&rsquo;s main key rows are. Space is made up by dropping the home/arrow clusters and combining them into a small set of arrows keys.Top most row is a rather useful array of keys: Back, Home, Recent Apps, Launcher Drawer, the usual brightness / volume / media kys, Search, Screen Shot, and a old fashioned Delete key &ndash; fn+Home through fn+next will pass a F1 through F12 key. Your arrow keys are fn+arrow for the home/end and page up/down keys as usual. It is a Control+FN layout. Where the right Windows key would normally be found is a key to show/hide the on screen keyboard without toggling Samsug&rsquo;s setting about hiding it. On the right side of the space bar you get a language switch key and then an alt key. Otherwise it&rsquo;s a standard keyboards &lsquo;main area&rsquo;.Keyboard handling is about the same as a Galaxy S5 and does not have the &ldquo;Force change to stock&rdquo; on keyboard connection problem that plagued earlier devices. Stock keyboard doesn&rsquo;t like shift+space (toasts the current language) so I often will it to Google Keyboard when typing.Battery life has been at least 150 to 200 hours with no sign of needing a charge. And a heck of a lot of typing, lol. It has a MicroUSB 3 charging port so you can use the newer MicroUSB 3 chargers like the tablet comes with or a regular MicroUSB 2 charger, used by most things not an iPhone.In terms of using it as a case, it snaps in and out and seems to work fine. I would worry about it eventually killing the tablet from wear and tear but it works OK. In the end I opted to use the Book Cover case for general use instead of snapping my tablet in and out of my keyboard case every day, so I use it like a dock &gt;_&lt;. With the offical book cover case the fit is not as good in the upright position but it still fits - you can&rsquo;t snap the tablet into the keyboard case with a regular case on your tablet, just put it in typing position.The &ldquo;Kickstand&rdquo; stype prop seems to be fairly secure and will also fit my Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet and my smartphone. But I mostly use it on my GNP 12.2. It might be nice if there was a more secure docking method, as to really use it &ldquo;In the lap&rdquo; you need to lean back a bit more than with a laptop; for use on a tablet or desk it is fine.Some folk might have liked a bundled touch pad but then they would just complain about accidentially hitting it. Touch screen == little need for a touch pad. I often use a Bluetooth mouse along side this keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-zagg-keyboard">Better than the Zagg Keyboard.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this after I stepped on my Zagg keyboard and broke it. It is better quality than the Zagg. It has rubber &ldquo;feet&rdquo; on the bottom so it doesn&rsquo;t slide around as much as the Zagg when using it on smooth surfaces. Since the Samsung keyboard has the back brace for the tablet, it is also more sturdy than when using the Zagg. It also seems to work in portrait which I couldn&rsquo;t do using the Zagg. I also had the problem of the Zagg disconnecting and reconnecting when I would type too fast. So far I haven&rsquo;t had that problem using this keyboard. Wish I had ordered this keyboard first.</p>

<h5 id="more-reliable-than-the-logitech-but-they-work-best-together">More Reliable than the Logitech, But they work best together.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These keyboards work fine, but their design is a little fragile. The Keyboard just has a trough for the tablet to sit in and nothing else to hold it there if you bump it hard. I am a clumsy oaf, so this scared me. Because of this I bought the Logitech Keyboard folio instead of the Samsung Keyboard first. My first Logitech folio lost about 4 of its keys after about 8 months. I bought a second one used and it wouldn&rsquo;t hold a charge, it had to be plugged in to a power source to work. Luckily the logitech keyboards can be pried out of the folios. So I bought a Samsung keyboard and double sided taped it into the logitech folio. This works great. I have a reliable keyboard with the secure arrangement of a folio. This may be a pricey ($100-$200 depending on Black vs White and New vs Used, etc.) if you are starting from scratch, but I already had a folio with a broken keyboard, so I had no down side.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-the-size-of-the-keyboard">I love the size of the keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the size of the keyboard. I agree with others on how snug the fit is between the tablet and the keyboard case when closed. I think maybe adding some type of grip tape to the inside edge of the keyboard might help it fit more snug. I am disappointed in the performance of the one that I had received. It really didn&rsquo;t hold a charge long and within a few weeks, the tablet wasn&rsquo;t picking up the signal from the keyboard therefore I had to return it. I ordered a replacement keyboard with the optimistic view that I just happen to have received one of the bad eggs. I really LOVED the keyboard when it was working.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-this">BUY THIS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was wary about buying this (at the time of purchase, a new product was over $100) because it was a lot of money for a bluetooth product (which has always been hit or miss in my experience) and because I wasn&rsquo;t sure how well my tablet would stay upright when the keyboard was angled on my lap desk. But I took a chance because every Galaxy compatible keyboard I&rsquo;ve found is bluetooth and this beat other builky keyboard cases by miles.I needn&rsquo;t have worried. This works great, connects almost instantly every time, and my tablet sits secure even when my lap desk is tilted back. I charge it about once every three months (and even then I just do it for safety&rsquo;s sake and not because the keyboard has run out of juice since initially charging it after arrival). It protects the tablet screen and is thin enough that I can fit tablet and keyboard into my purse or backpack and still have plenty of room left over for whatever else I need. I also like that it feels like I&rsquo;m using an actual laptop instead of a tablet, which is nice.Literally the only small, tiny thing I could possibly find which wasn&rsquo;t just perfect is that the on/off switch on the side is small and can be difficult to switch. Which is pretty much not any kind of meaningful problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it. Paired up effortlessly. Feels just like a laptop keyboard - not cheap. I don&rsquo;t notice any lag between keystrike and the character showing up on the screen. It&rsquo;s everything I expected, and has all the drawbacks that others have talked about, like not attaching itself to the back of the tablet when not in use. But I was expecting that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-samsung-keyboard-is-more-sturdy-and-allows-one-to-use-the-tablet-in-portrait">The Samsung keyboard is more sturdy and allows one to use the tablet in portrait &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried the Zagg keyboard, but the lip that holds the tablet in place broke (I was trying to use it in portrait mode). The Samsung keyboard is more sturdy and allows one to use the tablet in portrait mode easily (as well as landscape). They backrest is key. Initially I thought that it would be nice if the backrest angle were adjustable, but it really hasn&rsquo;t been an issue.</p>
