<h5 id="kink-free-noise-free-with-secure-connecting-posts">Kink free, noise free with secure connecting posts.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The last thing you ever want to worry about in your audio setup is your cabling. So, you want to buy a good set that will never come loose and always perform.After over a year of use, I can say that this cable fits the bill for both. I don&rsquo;t have any EMF sources nearby, but it&rsquo;s good to know that the cable offers shielding.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="caveat-one-or-two-inputs">caveat, one or two inputs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, I should have procured a cable that split into two connections on the subwoofer side, because the Onkyo amp has one dedicated subwoofer plug, which goes to two inputs. But the Polk subwoofer allows going to one only if you simulate an LFE. Thus the cable I got could be used, and transmits quite well. It&rsquo;s very well built.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-very-pleased-with-this-meadow-ridge-subwoffer-cable">I&rsquo;m very pleased with this meadow ridge subwoffer cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m very pleased with this meadow ridge subwoffer cable. Very high quality product, I installed it immediately, better than expected. I highly recommend this cable, I&rsquo;m using it on a Polk audio psw 505, and it is great!! I will buy more meadow ridge products as needed.i</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-cable-solid-connections">Solid cable, solid connections</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sturdy - hooked up once and expect it to last a lifetime. Tip and shell made solid connections with equipment jacks - I&rsquo;m not worried about corrosion developing over time or being pulled free by its own weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-for-my-setup">Worked great for my setup.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My setup prior to purchasing these cables :a HD Projector and 32 inch Sony LED TV connected to a Blu-ray player via HDMI and Bose Companion 2-speaker system for external speakers.I had used rca cables to connect my speakers with blu-ray those were really thin ones that you&rsquo;d get for 3-4 dollars online.Let me start by saying that I&rsquo;m not an audiophile. But, I always felt that the Bose Companio 2 speakers were lousy for movie playing because it neither delivered rich bass nor sounded great during conversations.All that changed after I replaced the thin rca-wires with these cables. I was amazed how well those bose speakers sounded with the same setup with new cables. I now enjoy the movie-like sound, low-bass and clear enough conversation without the need for turning up or down the volume, in a 12x112 ft room as good as I would in a movie hall(minus the surround sound effect ofcourse). One bit where I was a little hesitant on was the tightness of the plugs; but, it got on nicely(with just a little push) and will stay in place even during earthquake I believe;-) .Before I purchased this one, I did do a little research from price-point of view and the quality on the offer. With Belkin, Monster and Mediabridge making ito the final list, I went ahead with Mediabridge for their oblique-slotted plug design which would not get loose (unlike the straight slotted design.. i think) after multiple plug-in plug-off cycles.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-re-thinking-about-upgrading-your-subwoofer-cable-this-is-the-one-you-want">If you&rsquo;re thinking about upgrading your subwoofer cable, this is the one you want.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Went from a basic rca that was sending a bad signal and kept cutting out to this. The difference is night and day, now it actually feels like a subwoofer when playing movies and my music. As some others have said the connections are a little tight but that just means they have a secure connection. I got them on very easily with a little push.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-excellent-constructed-and-sounding-cable-compared-to-my-monster">An excellent constructed and sounding cable compared to my Monster</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An excellent constructed and sounding cable compared to my Monster, Esoteric, Belkin Pure AV. I would put this somewhere along the lines of the Belkin Pure AV stuff when it comes to external construction. Since i&rsquo;m not a robot or computer signal analyzer, to my ears, the sound reproduction is on par with my other sub cables costing far more. Bass was tight and controlled, I&rsquo;ve tested this on my original sub and the new sub that replaced it. I also used my Esoteric cable for comparison, both produced lows indistinguishable from one another. I&rsquo;d definitely say it&rsquo;s a win for my wallet and us audio lovers out there. Definitely worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="why-you-should-buy-this-cable-for-your-subwoofer">Why you should buy this cable for your subwoofer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So cables and audiophiles have a challenged love story. However, this cable is definitely worth it for one solid reason:PROPER SHIELDINGI have a hi-fi setup in my room consisting of a Marantz NR1403 receiver, B&amp;W 685B monitors, and all of my circuitry is run either off of powerline filters, or pure sine wave UPC&rsquo;s. However, my Klipsch RW12-II subwoofer had a 60hz hum. This hum was not caused by the power coming in to the sub, but was only present when the subwoofer was connected to my stereo via a really long RCA cable. The hum was actually coming from the wire itself, and that was simply because the cable was unshielded, causing induction in the cable which created a floor hum.While any subwoofer cables above this price point are all snake oil/magically based for their price, this cable does the job, does it well, and is all you will need for your subwoofer interconnects.But damn, this thing&rsquo;s connection is tighter than&hellip;You can fill that part in.</p>
