<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fabric-melts">Fabric melts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The rims around the edges of the silver lining burn and melt!!! I would understand if they were coming into contact with a flame, but it&rsquo;s melting by just holding the handle. I would not recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seller-responds-to-criticism-by-lawyering-up">Seller responds to criticism by lawyering up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The tag says the product is 100% cotton but the trim melts and sticks when in contact with hot surfaces (the rest of the potholder is fine). Other customers have pointed out this exact issue and taken pictures. I sent DII a message expressing concern that their material tag was inaccurate and how dangerous it is to put what is likely a synthetic material on something that is designed to touch hot surfaces. DII&rsquo;s never directly responded to my message, instead they had their LAWYER call me directly. I interpreted that as an intimidation tactic which was really bizarre.</p>

<h5 id="horrible-didn-t-pay-one-wash">Horrible!!! Didn&rsquo;t pay one wash!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only lasted one wash! Loved the colors and worked great, but were completed unraveled in only one wash. Completely disappointed. The towels from the same company also shrunk to nothing. It wasn&rsquo;t like I had them on super hot. Picture is before and after one wash! Horrible!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-was-looking-for">Exactly what I was looking for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading some mixed reviews on these I decided to order them anyway. I was tired of the new neoprene kind which are the only ones I can find in stores nearby these days. The $10 pair of those I&rsquo;ve tried, melted after just a few uses so I figured around $8 for 3 of these was a great price and also wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge loss if I ended up disappointed.These turned out to be exactly what I was looking for though. Nice standard potholders like the ones I&rsquo;m used to and they&rsquo;ve been doing the job just fine so far.There are a few things I remember from some of the other reviews which I&rsquo;d like to address. Someone mentioned there was a horrible plastic smell. I didn&rsquo;t find that to be the case. Yes they did smell a little bit like plastic when I first unwrapped them but that&rsquo;s what they were packaged in, so that&rsquo;s not surprising. The tags said to wash them before first use so I did. No more plastic smell whatsoever after that. As for them shrinking, they have very clear washing instructions on the tags which say to wash them in cold. I did that and they didn&rsquo;t shrink or warp at all. Maybe particularly bad stains won&rsquo;t go that way, I don&rsquo;t know, I haven&rsquo;t gotten them that dirty yet but I would try adding a non-bleach stain remover to the cold cycle first, instead of going against the washing instructions on the tags and then blaming the product and the 100% cotton front for doing what cotton usually does in hot water.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-the-perfect-size">These are the perfect size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(Update)I&rsquo;m still liking these potholders. I thought I&rsquo;d upload some photos showing the difference between a new potholder and one that has been laundered a few times. I think they wash up nicely. This is a good value.(Original post)I purchased these four months ago. I paid seven dollars for three grey potholders. I think they&rsquo;re fine potholders for that price. I&rsquo;ve washed and dried them several times. I like these because they&rsquo;re easy to use; they&rsquo;re flimsy but in a good way. I don&rsquo;t care for super thick potholders that make it difficult to grip hot bakeware. These are fairly small and that&rsquo;s exactly what I hoped for. Two of the potholders are slightly coming apart (nothing major). I think I can snip off the unraveling parts. Aside from that, I&rsquo;m really happy with these.Additionally, washing and drying potholders will typically wear down the heat resistant side making it more likely to burn yourself. So far, that hasn&rsquo;t been a problem. I&rsquo;m ordering the yellow set now.</p>

<h5 id="great-colors-hold-after-washing-in-warm-water-with-heat">Great colors hold after washing in warm water with heat &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great colors hold after washing in warm water with heat dry, but they do shrink washed that way, though not so much to render them useless but a more useful size imo. However, the hanger loop is very small and cumbersome to use and that loses them one star. Also I prefer smooth fabrics and not the fluffy terry hand towel style. But they are very basic and perfectly sized and economical, so that&rsquo;s an easy trade off for me anyway. And aside that these are good little pot holders. I don&rsquo;t iron anything unless it&rsquo;s necessary and these certainly don&rsquo;t fit that category. As-Is they work just fine, the terry cloth is strong and no shedding so far, they have just the right amount of fill, and the metallic side cloth works fine too although that finish did wear off a tad in the wash and I expect it to further with future washings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-do-what-they-are-intended-to-keep-my-fingers-and-counter-tops-cool">These do what they are intended to. Keep my fingers and counter tops cool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a single guy, so take this for what it is worth. I like these. I use them in combination with (under) silicon pads of the same size for really hot skillets coming off the stove after cooking steaks over high heat. They are great, the counter stays cool. I also use them on glass lids off the same skillets and my hand does not feel any heat. Unfortunately, whey burn very quickly if touched against a hot burner, and obviously soil then I splash grease on them. So, these are my second set. Little things like this can make cooking so much easier. These are the best little hot pads that I have found. Wish they were a couple bucks cheaper, but I guess you pay a little extra if you find something that works.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow-look-at-all-the-colors-it-is-was-so-hard-to-choose-just-one-so-i-didn-t-lol">Wow, look at all the colors, it is/was so hard to choose just one (so I didn&rsquo;t! lol)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are a GREAT value and do wonders with a few new towels (they have coordinating dish towels and washcloths) to add a pop of color to your kitchen any time of the year. You can get a holiday color, spring, summer &amp; fall at these affordable prices. They are Amazon&rsquo;s brand and you know how they always stand behind their products. I have never been disappointed yet! I like that these come in a three pack so you can put one on the counter and use two to carry a hot dish to the table. They have the thermal insulated silver side to boot! I LOVE them and my coordinating towels and washcloths I got to go with them. They set can be part of a housewarming gift with a nice hot casserole or pan of warm cookies on a tray!</p>
