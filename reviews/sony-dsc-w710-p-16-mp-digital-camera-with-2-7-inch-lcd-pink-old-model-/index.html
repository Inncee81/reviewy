<h5 id="decent-point-and-shoot-but-you-may-outgrow-it-in-several-months">Decent point and shoot, but you may outgrow it in several months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little Sony camera is very compact and light, and is a good starter point and shoot at this price. I take lots of pictures, so I was able to put this camera through its paces over about a three-week period. Here is a run-down:The Good- Very light and fits in any pocket- Relatively low cost and does not &ldquo;feel expensive&rdquo;, so I do not hesitate to just toss it in my pocket or bag- Has proven to be rugged. Has survived abuse (per the above bullet) very well- Love the &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; feature. It detects background light, fast action, faces, and other photo situations automatically. You can override this feature in the menus option.- Has plenty of photo-taking options such as landscapes, beach, toy, b&amp;w. As mentioned below in not-so-good, these features are pretty cumbersome to get to.- Picture quality is very good for this price range. There is no RAW file option, so you are totally dependent on the camera&rsquo;s JPEG processor, which is okay but has a lot of interpolation. It is a little slow to process, but definitely adequate below $100.- Uses SD cards, not the proprietary memory stick that Sony had used in the past.The Not So Good- Very menu-driven, so it takes time to find a photo feature (such as toy, b&amp;w, beach, landscape, etc.) and you could miss your shot. Best to stay in Auto/Easy mode since it does a decent job of choosing for you.- You have to navigate the menu to deactivate Easy mode before other options become available to you. This will slow you down a lot and may cause you to miss some shots. Ideally they would have any Easy mode on/off button on the camera itself.- The processor is slow, so there is a noticeable pause between shots. The continuous shooting mode labors through about one shot per second.- The post-processing and photo enhancing features on the camera are of limited usefulness. For example, it has a face enhancement feature that I found was only slightly effective. You will do MUCH better using your inexpensive desktop photo software to add enhancements. IMHO, this feature on the camera is more of a gimmick with primitive algorithms.- Sony has opted to use a non-standard USB connector. I like standard connectors that can be shared between devices. For this one, you will need to carry around the cord if you want to charge the camera&rsquo;s battery or transfer photos using USB.- To charge, you plug in the camera. The battery is removable, but the camera does not come with a separate battery charger, so you have to use the camera as the charger. In other words, you cannot charge a spare while you are using the camera. There may be an accessory for this, but then you are spending extra $$ on a low cost camera.RecommendationIf you want a low-cost, decent point and shoot, this is a good choice, particularly if you want to stay in easy mode most of the time. If you end up loving photography, or if you are already an experienced photographer, this camera will feel light on features and customization options pretty quickly.</p>

<h5 id="a-good-low-cost-camera">A Good Low Cost Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to have a decsent, low cost camera that was small enough for a small belt carrying case,was easy to use, took good still pictures and could shoot 720 HD video.This camera did exactly what I was looking for.You could, of course, pay more money for an expensive camera with mega more features, but this camera isperfect for travel, vacations, family gatherings, etc. which you can take anywhere you go withoutthe fear of losing big bucks should you accidently damage it.</p>

<h5 id="just-what-i-wanted">Just what I wanted.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is just right for me. Not to hard to figure out. It takes great pictures. I am going to like using it a lot. I like the white color. I like the automatic focus. I like the zoom. It is easy to use. I like it because I can charge it on my computer and in the wall socket. It also does videos. I haven&rsquo;t tried that yet. Also it does panorama pictures. I still have to try that also. I really haven&rsquo;t had the camera long enough to tell about all the features.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-camera">Decent camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first new camera in maybe 6 or 7 yrs. I love how fast it powers on, returns to being ready after taking a shot and the power saving feature. The battery charge also lasts a while. The one thing I do not like is how easily the memory card/battery over opens. It is not spring loaded like my other camera, so it comes open quite often. Taking panoramic shots is a no brainier and the results are great. The menu for me can be a bit confusing, but I guess the settings are useful once you take he time to see what each one does. The camera is a bit light for my taste, but I&rsquo;m getting used to the weight. The physical zoom is not as precise as I would like meaning that the zoom moves too fast, so it&rsquo;s a challenge to zoom to exactly where you need.Overall it is a nice camera, but I would like to try another Nikon with comparable or better features and price.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-camera">Great little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I lost my last sony camera during a trip to Israel, so I ordered this one. So far, I am very happy with it with the one exception that it did not come with an instruction booklet, and it is slightly different than my last one, and I have not yet figured out how to change some of the settings, such as shutting off the many icons on the screen at times. There are so many icons (good in that you know wether flash is on or off,etc.) that at times, they interfear with the picture. Also, my last sony used a duo pro sd card, while this one uses a standard sd card, meaning my old sd cards do not work in this camera.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-still-photos">Great for still photos&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my home inspection business. The flash is awesome. I&rsquo;m in dark crawl spaces and attics all the time. However, the camera takes a little while to take the photo. If I was using the camera to take pics of my kids, it would not be acceptable. But, then again, I only paid $78. The quality of the photos are great and the choice of resolution is helpful too. For me, this is a great camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-camera-is-awesome">this camera is awesome&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was using someone else&rsquo;s expensive camera and it was so difficult to use, I couldn&rsquo;t even figure out how to turn off the flash. This camera, is so easy to use, the menu&rsquo;s do not even need the owners manual. I had it figured out within minutes after turning it on. A very good camera for the price!!!! The only important thing is that the camera will only work with up to 8GB SD card. I bought a 16GB and the camera would not recognize it. But even so, with a 8GB at highest resolution, I have 1120 pictures available. Very nice.</p>
