<h5 id="i-find-this-to-be-a-good-deal-it-s-not-a-speedy-card-by-any">I find this to be a good deal. It&rsquo;s not a speedy card by any &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With the release of the 200GB cards, the 128GB has become a much more affordable option/upgrade. So for value to dollar, I find this to be a good deal. It&rsquo;s not a speedy card by any means, but as you go up in size, this seems to be a problem with all cards even those with a faster read/write speed that are considerably more expensive.I use Samsung Galaxy phones and I use the card to increase my storage capacity, mainly to hold my considerable music library, which with each larger card, I seem to find more &lsquo;can&rsquo;t live without&rsquo; music. Shooting video and photos are a secondary use for me, and one I mainly assign to the phone&rsquo;s internal memory than move over to the SD card for storage as that memory is faster. At least in my opinion without running tests.I rarely give 5 star reviews, so don&rsquo;t let the fact I&rsquo;ve given this 4 stars to mean there&rsquo;s something wrong with the card, just my opinion it&rsquo;s not an OUTSTANDING product, rather it&rsquo;s one that exceeds the average one would expect.I have not &ldquo;received a discounted or free card in exchange for my honest review&rdquo;. Although being solicited, never have and never will, so you can trust my reviews are 100% objective.If you agree all reviews should be unsolicited, please make certain to click the helpful button at the bottom of the review where it asks &ldquo;Was this review helpful to you?&ldquo;We need unsolicited reviews near the top. And either ignore or click no for all solicited reviews. Personally I do not find them helpful, and in fact, find they improperly inflate a mediocre or poor product&rsquo;s rating.</p>

<h5 id="web-browsing-computer-and-travel-movie-watching-computer-is-great-but-only-came-with-a-32gb-hard-drive">&hellip; web browsing computer and travel movie watching computer is great but only came with a 32gb Hard drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my Asus x205t that i use as a light web browsing computer and travel movie watching computer is great but only came with a 32gb Hard drive. It filled up fast and was unable to even update windows because there was no room to download the update files. this was a no brainer to get because of the value for the amount of storage. my laptop has a built in micro sd slot so it was a matter of just popping it in and transferring some files. I was able to put all my files an 52 movie files on this sd card and still have about 50GB remaining. Now traveling is great because i have a laptop with a crazy long battery life and enough storage to put over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of my movie collection from my external HD on it for long days at work or travel. I might buy another for my camera and never have to worry about swapping sd cards ever again.</p>

<h5 id="starts-out-fine-but-deteriorates-eventually">starts out fine, but deteriorates eventually</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this for about 8 months and has been working fine in my phone for that time. Starting a few days ago, the phone seems to suddenly start having issues with it. First it was all my new photos taken magically disappearing from the sd card (thankfully, it saved itself to the backups on the internet before it happened). Then apps installed on the card started to also seemingly have trouble saving its data as well as the store having problems updating or installing new apps.doesn&rsquo;t seem like this card is ideal for <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> use case in a phone as I&rsquo;ve seen others having same issues after several months in the phone.additional details from troubleshooting. the most bizarre thing that happens with this SD card right now is that if I delete anything from it, it&rsquo;ll seemingly restore itself to its previous state. This phenomenon happens from phone or via a PC whether I delete photos, add photos, delete all my apps, or delete any file really. The next time I insert the card, or reboot my phone, all the files I added or deleted are magically either gone or restored to how it was. It&rsquo;s almost like the card is in a snapshotted state, where it&rsquo;ll always revert back to that snapshot after the card in phone reboots or reinserted into a computer card reader.</p>

<h5 id="doa">DOA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dead right out of the package. I mean dead, dead. I inserted this MicroSD in my Asus ZenPad 10 and nothing happened. Tried it with the adapter in my laptop. Also nada. It was like I inserted an empty adapter. Tried some MicroSD cards in there just to make sure it was this one that had issues. It was. Sad. Getting ready to send this shi&hellip; er, chip back now.Must be my turn for bad karma. Been an Amazon customer since 2000. May have returned one or two things total until this year. One other item got &ldquo;lost&rdquo; in the FedEx center in Chicago a few years back. This will make the third item I have returned in about two months. One item severely damaged in shipping (the FedEx driver should have been ashamed to even leave that one), one item just didn&rsquo;t work well and this one doesn&rsquo;t work at all.** Update **I replaced it with SanDisk Ultra 128GB microSDXC UHS-I Card with Adapter, Black, Standard Packaging (SDSQUNC-128G-GN6MA), which is working great.</p>

<h5 id="2-cards-died-after-less-than-1-year-of-use-not-sure-if-a-lemon-or-poor-product">2 Cards Died After Less Than 1 Year of Use - Not sure if a lemon or poor product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: Samsung replaced my original card under warranty shortly after my original review, but my phone has killed the replacement in under a year, yet again. While it could definitely be the phone killing the card, I think I will try my luck with a different brand this time.Picked up to expand storage and move compatible apps to SD on my Galaxy s5. The card died after only 7 months use. Running chkdsk results in an incorrect able error. Performing a full format of the card also failed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="died-right-after-return-window-closed">Died right after return window closed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This micro SD card is junk. I used it for just barely over a month in my Moto Z Force phone to expand memory for my Spotify app. Class 10 is what is suggested for my phone, and I figured Samsung was the way to go with a name brand.2 weeks ago all my music I downloaded was suddenly gone, and I was prompted by my phone to format my &ldquo;new&rdquo; SD card. I assumed this was an error with the music files that Spotify was using. So I talked with them first, and they said they&rsquo;d look into it. Came back ok with the files. They suggested I return the SD card if it happens again.So that brings me to today, 2 weeks later, and exactly 2 days past my return window, it happened again. I should of just returned this the first time, but like they say, hindsight is always 20-20.Items like this needs to have a higher return window. This is also a reason I try not to leave reviews until later instead of the day I get an item.</p>
