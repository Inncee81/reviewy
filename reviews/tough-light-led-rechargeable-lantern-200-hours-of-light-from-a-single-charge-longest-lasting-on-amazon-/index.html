<h5 id="if-you-re-looking-for-cheap-junk-this-isn-t-it">If you’re looking for cheap junk, this isn’t it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this light from an ad I saw on FB where some other campers were buying it too. This is by far the best lantern I have ever owned! I am very impressed with how strong is it built! I’ve been using it around the house just to test it out and it’s really bright on the highest setting and lights up my entire family room. The company has a website that explains everything so clearly. The light comes with a user’s manual that even has tips for using the light. My favorite tip is how you can hold the light at your side and the diffuser cap “throws light” all around you but not in your eyes (very smart design).Here’s a quick overview of the highlights…Never buy expensive batteries again. The light lasts for 50,000 hours and then the entire light is recyclable. The rechargeable battery has a range of 24, 75 and 200 hours (high, medium, low). There is a locator light to find it at night. There is a battery life indicator so you know when it’s almost dead in case you need to ration out your light use. There is a built in cell phone charger. There is an SOS light for emergencies so someone can find you. There is a red light feature with flashing red for auto needs. Its water and drop resistant. The charging cable fits in the battery compartment so you’ll never lose it. It can be hung in multiple positions. Lastly, there’s a 2 year warranty that was very easy to apply for. The company sends you an email and gives you an order number to track it.I’ll follow up in the future to let you know how it goes but so far I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it!</p>

<h5 id="great-product-that-will-see-lots-of-use">Great product that will see LOTS of use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this for my husband, a guy who is very particular about his hunting/camping gear. It&rsquo;s next to impossible to find anything that he doesn&rsquo;t already have or that will satisfy him. He opened it this morning (Happy Birthday!) and he is very impressed. It&rsquo;s a while before hunting season, but he&rsquo;s keeping it in his truck for emergencies. This is a very well-made product, and I love the feature where you can store in the charging cable in the battery compartment&hellip;smart! How many charging cables are already lost in a tangle somewhere?? I love the size too&hellip;not too big or unwieldy when you&rsquo;re considering packing for a 2 week hunt. I appreciate the immediate follow-up emails - how to contact Tough LIght with any questions or problems (I can&rsquo;t see how there can ever be a problem, so probably won&rsquo;t be contacting them!)&hellip;take it from a wife who has spent years trying to make her husband happy with the latest and greatest gear&hellip;.THIS is a winner!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-product">EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried other battery operated lanterns over the years, and for one reason or another,was ALWAYS displeased. Usually, the problem was with the batteries corroding after a long period of not being used, which then corroded the contacts within the device itself. I cannot say enough about &ldquo;Toughlight&rdquo;. First,..its rechargable, which means saving LOTS of money on NOT having to run to the store( especially when your power has been knocked out and it&rsquo;s totally nasty weather outside) and buy new batteries. Third, other lanterns I purchased over the years don&rsquo;t even come close with putting out BRIGHT light for so many hours on all three modes. The only thing I can think of that may be a issue for some, is the price, HOWEVER, you get what you pay for,&hellip;and what you&rsquo;re paying for is QUALITY, QUALITY, QUALITY. Buy this lantern and you probably will never have to worry about buying another lantern again. Oh, by the way,No, I was NOT compensated for writing this post. I just happen to be extremely pleased.</p>

<h5 id="nice-little-lantern">Nice Little Lantern</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I camp in Baja 2-3 times a year in a totally off grid Palapa. So everything we use must be battery or gas and preferably rechargeable thru our vehicle so we dont need to bring a stock of batteries.Ive used solar powered lanterns in the past. While acceptable,the light they give off is weak. They also need daily charging in the sun. If you forget to put them in the sun then no dim lantern light that night.The Tough Light is compact. So pay attention to that when you order. Its only 7&rdquo; high by 3.5&rdquo; wide. Not a problem since it gives off big light. The size makes it so its easily stored and at the campsite is not in the way. With the three light level settings you will find one perfect to suite the task at hand. It has hanging hooks on each end, plus it comes with an extra quick release hook. That makes locating, and relocating this lantern much easier. The entire dome screws off to give the user even another type of more direct light source. Very versitle. The Cree Leds that are used are top of the line. A few years ago a litlle lantern giving out this much LED light would not have been possible.Use your phone charging cable to boost up your phone with a little emegency charge.It also has a red light/flashing feature that could come in handy as a warning light if stuck on the road at night.Summary. Nice little lantern. As the name states, its tough. Has an armoured rubber coating. Its well built, compact and versitile.Recharges easily thru standard USB cable like a cell phone.</p>

<h5 id="effective-back-up-emergency-lighting">Effective back-up emergency lighting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased two of these portable lights about three months apart. The units function exactly as advertised, with charging capabilities, a very bright lantern-type light that can be modulated both in intensity and color, and a very &ldquo;tough&rdquo; - feeling exterior finish. The lights can be hung from a hook or carried, and used as emergency blinkers-beacons. I cannot speak to the 2-year warranty as yet, but so far, have been pleased with the purchase of this relatively expensive but effective back-up emergency light source.</p>

<h5 id="rugged-lantern-for-camping-or-emergency-preparedness">Rugged lantern for camping or emergency preparedness.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This light/lantern is pretty awesome! I was skeptical at first since the price tag seemed high but after having this lantern I am glad I decided to spend a little more.It feels much more ruggedly constructed than almost any other light I own (aside from my Petzl head lamps), and it is quite bright.It charges quickly and easily, and while the red light flashing is kind of annoying, I also know that I&rsquo;ll be glad it for that feature when/if the lights go off.</p>

<p>I just got it in the mail and it will not turn on or charge. Tell me what did I pay for ????</p>

<h5 id="one-minor-but-very-annoying-flaw">One minor but very annoying flaw</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product with one minor flaw: you can&rsquo;t shut off the LED status light. It blinks constantly, so you can find it in the dark (this is in the user manual).</p>

<h5 id="just-as-good-as-promised">Just as Good as Promised</h5>

<p>Amazingly bright and easy to use/charge/position. I have only one tiny complaint. When not in use the &ldquo;ready&rdquo; light flashes every 10-15 seconds just so you can find the&hellip;</p>

<p>So far this is great. Don&rsquo;t let your kids stare at it when it&rsquo;s on high. That&rsquo;s how bright it is.</p>

<p>I purchased this product for a father&rsquo;s day gift in May. I gave it to him and it does not work. This is an expensive piece of junk. And I,m 1 week past the return window.</p>
