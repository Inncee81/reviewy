<h5 id="the-craftsmanship-is-poor-needed-to-do-a-little-straightening-where-the">the craftsmanship is poor, needed to do a little straightening where the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>doesnt hold one of my downhill bikes, but it does adjust enough to hold my other bikes. the craftsmanship is poor, needed to do a little straightening where the pieces join together and aligning of the bolt holes. need washers cause the guide holes are too big for the bolt heads. even once put together, the vertical post wobbles, dont tighten it too much cause the metal is very thin and will crush. nothing major but also not something you should have to do. but for the price shipped to hawaii, i cant complain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-worked">It worked</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, it&rsquo;s ok. I was able to put four bikes on it with some extremely different frame configurations. The rack needs to have a few more notches to be able to adjust the bikes little higher so as to be able to sweep under the tires and to be able to have just a little room to adjust.The quality is as would be expected from a Chinese made product. Fairly light weight and the finish is decent. It comes with rubber feet to protect the floor although the holes that are in the framework for the feet were drilled too big and the feet just fall out, I had to re drill new holes to get the feet to stay in.I had two old steel Schwinn&rsquo;s a his and her&rsquo;s on one side and it was totally stableAll in all it&rsquo;s ok, but my four star rating is slightly generous.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-don-t-recommend">works but don&rsquo;t recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am keeping this because it will do but there must be something better out there. This absolutely has to be mounted to the wall, the parts do not secure to each other, all joints are loose and somewhat questionable.Also I question being able to put two street bikes on there and still be able to access both. I currently have one street and one mountain bike. The mountain bike is so low the back tire is on the ground.</p>

<h5 id="i-don-t-dislike-it-enough-to-return-it">I don&rsquo;t dislike it enough to return it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dislike it enough to return it. It does work. But I was close.This arrived a couple days ago and building it just now, I was sure it didn&rsquo;t even work. Things fit together pretty loosely and there are various plastic screw covers that I sheared a couple of. Once together, it wouldn&rsquo;t balance, even without bikes. I figured out that I&rsquo;d put on one of the structural pieces upside down. If you&rsquo;re reading my review and puzzled about how to assemble it, it&rsquo;s part B, the &ldquo;angled section.&rdquo; The curved cutouts match the round tubing on the base. Also, if you think you got four hooks for one side, pull the little rubber thing off and flip the hook around.I bought it, and not the Delta Michaelangelo, because I like that it&rsquo;s supposed to be freestanding, and the Delta rack transferred some rubber to my landlord&rsquo;s wall in the place I rented a few years ago. But with two bikes on it, it doesn&rsquo;t feel super stable. My old Delta rack was actually pretty good as long as it was assembled well.Delta Michelangelo Two-Bike Gravity StandAnyway, I got it up and it&rsquo;s working now, and apparently writing a nasty review on the Internet is less trouble than returning it. And it&rsquo;s for a couple bikes I don&rsquo;t anticipate taking on and off that often. But seriously - consider the Delta.</p>

<h5 id="4-bike-holder-for-garage">4 Bike holder for garage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have 3 bikes. They had been occupying lot of space in our garage. So we needed something to organize it.When I saw this one I could not help my self ordering it.Well- I guess I was lucky that the trial eventually remained successful- it is a heavy product so don&rsquo;t think with Amazon&rsquo;s return policy you could send it back with small return cost- plus by the time we had received it- the box was broken at many placesIt is very easy to set up. The material seems to be very well made.The bike holding brackets have been very easy to put in place.The only reason I gave 4 star instead of 5 is because - the bike brackets needed to be adjusted at different levels as the front bracket would otherwise not hold the connection area of top and down tubes of the bike. If you keep the brackets at the same level and put your bike then you may find that bike&rsquo;s front wheel drops lower than the back wheel and the bike hangs like back side up. By keeping front bracket higher than back bracket you could keep the bike straight horizontally. The plastic part of the bracket seems little low quality- since everything depends on this part- if the plastic part breaks then the whole bracket set may become useless.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-what-i-needed">Perfect for what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these racks. From opening the box to having the bikes mounted took less than 15 minutes. I have them in my garage. Great space saving design, and the arms that hold the bikes are adjustable to any shape frame. It&rsquo;s easy! For the price, I am very satisfied! Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-bike-rack-easy-to-assemble">Sturdy Bike Rack - Easy to Assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Racor Pro PLB-2R Two-Bike Stand The rack was extremely easy to assemble. It comes with a 4&rdquo; mounting screw to attach the top of the rack to a wall stud. I was nervous about the quality of the arms after reading some reviews. I found that the arms hold the bikes very well. I used bungee cords to prevent the wheels from spinning and to keep the handlebars facing forward. I am very happy with the rack and would recommend the product!</p>

<h5 id="perfect-size-and-price-is-just-right">Perfect size and price is just right.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this bike rack. Super easy to put together, no assembly required. You do need to secure the top pole with the anchor provided. I have a cement wall in my garage, so I improvised and used zip ties to anchor the bike rack to another already installed anchor. Fits perfect!! I put my car bike rack on top.READ MORE</p>
