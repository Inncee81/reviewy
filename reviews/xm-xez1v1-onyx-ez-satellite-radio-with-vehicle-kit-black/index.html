<h5 id="xm-at-home-or-in-any-vehicle">XM at home or in any vehicle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a subscription to SiriusXM in your car or if you want to listen at home, this is a small unit that picks up satellite radio and plays it through any radio.1. I play this through a home stereo CD/radio through the auxiliary port. This is an outlet on the back of most stereo systems. Simply connect the cable from this port to the Onxy and select &ldquo;AUX&rdquo; to hear satellite stations through your stereo system. You will be controlling the choice of stations on the Onxy unit.2. If you don&rsquo;t have satellite radio installed in your vehicle, or if you want to share one subscription between two vehicles, you can mount a magnetic antenna on the outside of the car, and play this by connected through the 12v DC &ldquo;cigarette lighter&rdquo; outlet in the car or if your car has an &ldquo;aux&rdquo; connector to its stereo system, you can use that.This radio comes in two &ldquo;flavors&rdquo;&ndash;home kit and car kit. If you want both, you&rsquo;d have to buy an accessory kit to add home or auto capability to whatever choice you make.You need a subscription to XMSirius. If you have a subscription for your car, you can add an additional radio for home use. It&rsquo;s an extra subscription charge to also play over the internet on your computer. If you prefer, you could use an internet subscription and play via your Kindle, tablet, phone over Wifi rather than using a radio and a stereo system.Downsides:Not easy to change channels in the car, even with presets on the buttons.If you are using the FM broadcasting method to pick the radio up in your stereo, it&rsquo;s a bit weak in terms of signal.You have to be right next to the radio and sometimes the &ldquo;blank&rdquo; channel you choose will become a broadcast channel as you travel down the road. You may need to change FM frequencies as you move along. When I was using this in an older vehicle that didn&rsquo;t have built-in SiriusXM, I ended up setting several blank presets on my radio so I could switch as needed on long trips.You need to have the antenna looking up at the southern sky; my office has no windows and the front office is a northern exposure; to use this, I&rsquo;d have to install an outside antenna and either route in some coax cable through the ceiling to my office or use a repeater (wireless broadcaster) from the room accessible to the outside for the antenna.Summary:If you already subscribe via your automobile, you may find that the additional internet subscription is a far less expensive option for adding home listening. If you have no satellite radio in your car, this is one way to add satellite reception, but the controls on the radio are somewhat small and inconvenient for use while driving. You still need a subscription to get this to work, and may have to add it to an existing subscription.</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-read-this-before-you-purchase">Buyer Beware!!!!!!! Read this before you purchase!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This radio is great, and a welcome replacement from my aging Starmate replay. The problem is that this radio is NOT a Sirius receiver, it is an XM. By activating this receiver to my existing Sirius account (for a $15 activation fee), I lost channels that I already had with my Sirius subscription (Howard Stern, Nascar, Ect.). After an hour wasted wasted with an &ldquo;account specialist&rdquo;, they told me that XM didn&rsquo;t offer the same package that I had with Sirius BUT they would be happy to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; my account to their &ldquo;all access&rdquo; plan for an additional $3 a month to get back the channels that I was already receiving for a cheaper monthly rate. Absolutely ridiculous! If I had known this Prior to purchasing this radio, I never would have. Don&rsquo;t make the same mistake that I did, if you are already a Sirius subscriber. The problem in my instance was not the Onyx at all, it is SiriusXM extorting their services in a sleazy way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="updated">Updated&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my parents new car that didn&rsquo;t have satellite radio. It was really easy to set up and worked flawlessly once we setup the subscription. Love the fact that is has a built in FM transmitter.Update: The antenna only worked sporadically on the product now - only used for a couple months. Disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meh">Meh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Sirius subscriber for about 12 years, since long before the Sirius-XM merger. Unfortunately, the recent batch of satellite radio receivers only seem to last a few years at best so I&rsquo;ve been through a number of them and, until now, I always purchased Sirius receivers. Although it doesn&rsquo;t say so in the product description, its turns out that this is actually an XM rig. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s just this particular receiver or if audio fidelity from the XM satellite is not as high as from the Sirius satellites but I noticed the difference right away. It&rsquo;s not terrible, but it&rsquo;s not as good as my previous Sirius receiver and since one of Sirius&rsquo;s selling points is (or, at least, used to be) “CD Quality Sound,” it&rsquo;s disappointing to say the least.Oh, well; I hear the XM rigs tend to last longer than their Sirius counterparts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-siriusxm-requires-a-whole-new-subscription-to-activate-this-radio">Beware - SiriusXM requires a whole new subscription to activate this radio</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This should answer the question some people (including me, originally) have posted. This radio requires a separate subscription to activate it. You CANNOT use this with an existing subscription that you may have in your car. Sirius XM makes you buy an entirely new subscription to activate this radio. So it turns out to be very expensive. If you buy from Sirius, they will give you the radio FREE with the necessary subscription, so that is probably the better option. I was annoyed when I got this and called them to activate it and learned all of this the hard way. They are a rather greedy company, too, so they wouldn&rsquo;t give me any discount on the subscription, even though it was a second one (I already had one in my car). So Caveat Emptor on this - this is NOT an inexpensive way to listen to your current Sirius XM subscription in your home. It winds up costing a total of about $150.00 when all is said and done to make this radio work. The seller and shipment were fine, and the product was in perfect condition - just not an ideal setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-and-service">Good product and service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second one. Thye first did not work. This one worked for a couple of weeks but got progressively worse. I have taken a couple of trips recently so have not had time to write. Just returned and find it worse than when I left. It continually cuts in and out but is mostly out. I cannot find a place to notify seller since this is a replacement of a previous defective unit. I have had satellite radio for about thirteen years and a couple of units wore out after a few years but never this kind of problem. I think you have a bad batch. How can I get a refund?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="installed-very-easily-works-great">Installed very easily. Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed very easily. Works great. Only recommendations I wish they would offer a wireless antenna. Routing the wired antenna is going to be a little difficult.</p>

<p>this is our replacement for an ancient Delphi we have had for almost 20 years. The quality is much clearer than the old unit.</p>

<h5 id="ok-for-the-money">OK for the money.</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK, but does not offer a lot of stations available from other radios.</p>
