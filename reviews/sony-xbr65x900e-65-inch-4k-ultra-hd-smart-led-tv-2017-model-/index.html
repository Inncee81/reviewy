<h5 id="great-for-ps4-pro-and-streaming-4k-content">Great for PS4 Pro and streaming 4K content</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I held off purchasing a 4k TV until 2017 models were released hoping to get 4K and HDR at once. I originally looked at purchasing a Samsung KS8000 (2016 model) based on reviews but those are super hard to find now. I use rtings.com almost exclusively to compare different models and get the reviews on the major features I am looking for (HDR, wide color gamut, local dimming, and input lag). Based on what I was looking for, pretty much gaming with future potential for 4k Blu Ray, I went with the Sony XBRX900E. So far I am completely happy and satisfied with my choice. First off definitely research online and don&rsquo;t only base your decision from what you see at a local store. I always go into my local Best buy to get a first hand look but you can&rsquo;t know what you are actually getting unless you research online (specs like brightness, HDR, input lag, wide color gamut, etc). This TV is awesome when you have a PS4 pro and are going from no 4K and no HDR to this TV with those features. The games on PS4 pro that have been enhanced look awesome (Horizon XD, Shadow of Mordor, Deus Ex MD, NMD, Titan Fall 2, Ratchet and Clank, etc) night and day difference. No lag, HDR is awesome, colors and brightness make games more immersive. The smart capabilities of this TV are great for streaming 4k content (Amazon and YouTube). I&rsquo;ve obviously never streamed 4k before since I didn&rsquo;t have a 4k TV but I find myself streaming random things in 4k just to see the beautiful picture. It&rsquo;s amazing how much random content is available to stream in 4K. I have a Vizio soundbar with a optical input and was concerned that I would have to use two different remotes. In the home screen (press the home button) there is a picture of what I initially thought was a random video labeled &ldquo;audio control setup&rdquo; it walks you through connecting the included RF blaster&rdquo; so you can control your sound bar with the Sony remote, nice. No complaints so far. If you have been looking for a 4K TV to pair with your PS4 pro or to view/stream 4K content this is a great choice.</p>

<h5 id="inky-black-oled-like-experience-at-a-fraction-of-the-cost">Inky black OLED like experience at a fraction of the cost!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was bent on getting a 75 inch TV and I really wanted to get OLED; that left the LG TV with a $20,000 price tag. So, next, I was bent on getting a Samsung because I like the brightness of their screens. Samsung is charging $6000 for their 65&rdquo; QLED technology which is barely the next generation of technology. Looking at the Rtings website reviews for best 75 inch TVs, they mentioned that the best mid range 75 inch TV was this Sony 75&rdquo; X900E. I did the research. It is not OLED in terms of measurable quantities (it is very good) but I will tell you that the actual viewing experience is 99% of what it is with an OLED TV. The blacks are inky wet black and the the brights are amazing. I can watch this TV outside and it looks great. It very bright. The aesthetics are beautiful. It has a very small bezel, a the glass front has the same allure as fine crystal. It has plenty of adjustments for those who like to tweak and I think it looks great with the settings out of the box. The picture quality, is just amazing and again I can&rsquo;t stress enough how beautiful the HDR (High Dynamic Range) is. Deep rich blacks, plenty of mid tones and excellent highlights. For the price difference I would buy this TV every time and not really miss any real perceivable differences in OLED. Sony deserves a huge compliment for creating such a beautiful TV and picture as such a great price. I got mine for approximately $3200 and that is great at this point in time.If you are looking for a beautiful TV and picture, especially one in the 75 inch class, mid range and reasonable pricing then this is your TV!</p>

<h5 id="the-picture-quality-is-fantastic-and-worth-every-penny">The picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve had the 75” 4K HDTV for over a month now and overall it is a great set. However, upgrading from a Samsung HD TV, there are some things to note.OVERALL (the short version): I would recommend this TV for the picture quality alone. 5 Stars. It is magnificent! There are workarounds for the CONS listed below, so overall it’s a terrific set for 4K content as well as regular HD content. I’ve decided to start with the CONS to get them out of the way. The PROS follow below.CONS:The SONY BRAVIA 4K XBR75X900E does not seem to be able to handle internet speeds much higher than 60mbps (wired or connected by LAN). This is acceptable for streaming HD on the apps that accompany the set, but 4K content can be iffy. I tried viewing a Coral Reef video on Amazon Prime in 4K, and it took almost a minute for the picture to catch up to 4K quality. There were a few times the picture lagged. I tried watching a random standup comedy video on Netflix in 4K and the server wouldn’t connect. This was probably an issue with Netflix because when I tried again, the connection worked and seemed to hold a 4K picture in a similar way to the Amazon app. The YouTube app was the same. 4K videos lagged and took some time to catch up.Luckily, the Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model) I purchased can handle faster internet speeds, so we use the player almost exclusively for streaming 4K content. I’ve also read other reviewers mention that Chromecast or an Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player can handle higher internet streaming speeds, so that is something to consider. Also, the TV takes about a minute to connect to Wi-Fi after it’s turned on. Not a big deal, but worth noting. Connected to LAN, it connects a little quicker.Upscaling looks terrible when done on the TV. I wasn’t expecting this to be the issue, but once again, the Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model) saved the day! Upscale regular Blu-Ray’s on the player, and the picture looks nearly as good as actual 4K. You will notice the difference. We streamed a few older shows from HULU like Cheers and Seinfeld and they looked great as well. Again, the picture quality is fantastic and worth every penny!**** HDR UPDATE <strong><em>I want to thank everyone for their comments about my negative thoughts on HDR. It forced me to do some research on the internet to figure out why HDR looked to terrible on this set. After trial and error, I finally figured it out. You see, I have a home theater system. I bought an ONKYO Receiver a few years back that was 4K compatible. I did not, however, take into consideration that it might not be HDR compatible. (It&rsquo;s not.) So, I was running the 4K player through an HDMI cable into the receiver first, and then into the 4K TV. Which means, no HDR content was reaching the TV. So, as one commenter pointed out, I was turning HDR on when no HDR was available, which results in my original comments below, the picture is dark and the colors look cartoonish.I WAS WRONG!! And I&rsquo;m glad I was wrong. Nobody likes eating crow, but I am happy to do it after I saw HDR for the first time last night. It is awesome! The colors look amazing, the blacks are really dark, and the whites are really white. My wife and I watched Coral Reef Adventure under the Prime UHD selection from the Amazon app directly on the TV. HDR turned on automatically (as a commenter mentioned it should), and WOW!! It looked spectacular.If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing a bad picture when turning HDR on, they must first realize that not all 4K content is presented with HDR. But what really fixed my situation is this: Run the HDMI directly from the 4K Player to the HDMI &ldquo;1&rdquo; slot in the back of the TV. That&rsquo;s all it took to make HDR a reality, the way it was intended.I&rsquo;m keeping the original comments in the review in the hopes of helping anyone else who experiences this issue. Thank you again for the comments about how HDR should work. You guys are the best!</em></strong>******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************<strong>ORIGINAL COMMENTS*HDR is terrible. This is not the fault of the set, but I want to talk about it here because it’s not worth turning on. If it works for you because of bright lighting in the room or whatever, go for it. But for my wife and I, HDR is not needed. Basically, it’s an artificial layer added to the original picture source to “enhance” things. After several days of tweaking with the settings, trying multiple HDR enabled discs, etc., the picture only got worse with HDR turned on. All it seems to do is make every scene darker, a LOT darker. The HDR effect on colors can be weird. There is a slight red push over flesh tones, and sometimes the colors appear cartoonish, like they were drawn in with crayons. It’s gimmicky, at best. So, if you’re new to 4K, and you’re worried that this set won’t support Dolby Vision, don’t worry too much about it. The 4K picture alone is beautiful you won’t be disappointed with the picture as it is.Also, on the subject of HDR: There are three options, ON, OFF, and AUTO. The only time HDR will turn on is when the HDR setting is switched specifically to ON. If set to AUTO, it might as well be set to OFF because it will never turn on automatically.</strong>********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************PROS:The picture is beautiful! It is a vast improvement over the regular HD picture from our older TV (which looked great as far as 1080P goes). There are many settings to tweak the set to your liking, and the LIVE FOOTBALL mode is perfect for games. When you watch 4K content, you can get up right next to the screen and see amazing details in the background. You probably don’t want to watch a movie right up close to the screen, but sometimes it’s fun to check out the details of things in the distance.My wife and I have watched Blu-Ray movies and UHD 4K movies from discs as well as streaming 4K content (using the separate 4K player), and they all look great. Regular DVD’s leave a little to be desired, but I knew that going in, so it’s not much of a surprise. What sells this set is the picture! And let’s be honest, this is what you’re looking for in a 75” 4K UHD set. It is spectacular for HD and 4K content! Spectacular!Games and Apps: I play Uncharted 4 on a regular PS4 (not the pro) and the details in color are phenomenal. WOW!! I can’t imagine the game looking any better on a PS4 Pro, but I’d have to do a side by side comparison to really tell the difference.*A NOTE ON SCREEN MIRRORING: If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, it probably will not connect to the TV. The phone will locate the set, but won&rsquo;t connect. SOLUTION: Use Chromecast or (once again) the Sony UBP-X800 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Player (2017 Model)</p>
