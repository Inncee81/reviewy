<h5 id="go-pro-soft-digits-46-in-1-accessories-kit-heaven">Go Pro + Soft Digits 46-In-1 Accessories Kit = Heaven !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> If you own a go pro then this is a MUST item for you. 46 in 1 accessories kit for Go pro with the case from Soft digit is just mind blowing. It has been almost a year since I bought my Go Pro Hero Silver and I have been buying separate accessories since then for it. Each accessories cost not less then 10 bucks at least. This kit with case costs only 24 bucks which is way cheaper than any of the kits in the market I have ever seen.This accessories have all the required mount including head mount, chest mount, wrist mount, float-able stick, selfie stick, tripod mount, helmet mount, bike mount, scooter mount. The adjustable head strap is compatible with all sizes Motion cameras including go pro. It allows you to use the Motion camera on head or helmet to record those before you. The Chest Harness Strap Belt and Vertical Surface J-Hook Buckle helps your Motion camera to have a shooting and recording while surfing or in water park. Different pieces of mount available in the kit for different kind of activities like bicycle, auto cycle riding,sking boating, fishing,hiking, camping, swimming.The tripod mount help you to take timer photos with out anybody&rsquo;s help and selfie stick help you to take perfect family selfie with you Go Pro . Stick has adjustable ball head and thumb screw locks for multiple angle shooting with 180 degree position. Floating grip mount helps you to take photos while swimming in lake or river or in water park. It floats on water and other end of that mount strap stays in you hand so there is no way that you will loose your camera in heavy force of water even if you loose it then it will float on water because of the design of the mount. You can secures your Motion Camera flat against your wrist for hands-free convenience.Perfect for surfing, snorkeling, climbing and skiing.The Motion Camera anti fog inserts are necessary if you are take your Motion Camera underwater or into humid places. Insert a few of these into the camera housing, it will not fog up and give you clear photos . Car Windshield Suction mount is really easy to install like cellphone mounts. . It can mount your device securely on your car while you are driving and can be swiveled into 180 degree as the picture shows providing more angles for viewing and bringing more convenience to the users.Case of this accessories looks cool and perfectly fit in all the stuffs mentioned here and apart from that its is designed to accommodate camera, battery, SD memory card, housing doors and all your leads.This Soft Digits 46-In-1 Accessories Kit is 100% recommendable because of its quality , design and universally useful mounts. Being a true Go Pro loved I seriously loved this kit. I received it for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have uploaded video here showing all the mounts and accessories for my Go Pro, let me know if anyone have questions.</p>

<h5 id="great-hero-5-kit">Great hero 5 kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great combination of gear for the gopro. I got this for a few different trips and it has held up well. I am not sure where to attach the orange float, but I have not found the need to actually use it yet. I have used it primarily with the yellow float and string, the selfie stick, and the clip mount. I meant to try the head mount, but ended up leaving it on accident. I like the fact that there is lot of flexibility in how you attach it to just about anything and you can manage the angle as well as the tilt. There is not a place to attach the hand tether with the yellow stick/float so I had to improvise. This was one thing that my existing one already had and I am not sure how it was missed in this case because there is one on the longer selfie stick. I was also not sure how you should actually be lining things up in the foam cut outs and there was not really and information on what each hole should be used for or was cut out for.</p>

<h5 id="something-for-any-application">Something for any application</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit has every you need for a GoPro. It has so much stuff for the price you can&rsquo;t go wrong. Everything is made really well and something for any application</p>

<h5 id="i-must-say-i-am-very-pleased-that-i-did">I must say I am very pleased that I did</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this kit and received it very quickly - in two business days! I shopped around for a while before I finally purchased this kit. I saw some reviews that items were missing and commenting on quality so I was a little hesitant to make the purchase. I must say I am very pleased that I did. All items in the picture were in the kit. Everything seems to be sturdy and good quality - I have not used any of the items yet but opened everything and played around with them. The wrist band it great quality and there are two Velcro strips and interior and exterior strip - this means that if you want to wear it higher up on your arm - you can wear it as an arm band as well. I also really like the tripod - it is very sturdy and I like that you can wrap it around things like poles or tree limbs to take pictures. It is much smaller than I expected though, I guess that will definitely make it more portable. The selfie stick extends very far and while it does feel not as sturdy as the other items when fully extended, I would still trust my camera on it - maybe just not hold it over the grand canyon :) I did notice a hole in the sponge that you put on the back of the camera to make it float - I hope it will still work! I am very impressed with the quality of the items and the sheer amount of items in this kit and I really like the carry case as well, it will make it much easier to travel with all of these pieces! I am not technically savvy so I think it is important to mention that this case comes with a lot of pieces and no instructions so it may take some time to put them together!</p>

<h5 id="gopro-accessories">GoPro Accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the GoPro accessories kit was reasonable and a real benefit for having multipleattachments for the GoPro camera, I would give 5 stars except for two things that Iwould have liked. One it came with no instructions and some parts I don&rsquo;t know howto use. Two the case should be more uniform to contain all items in a orderly fashion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great Buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great. Very universal. I feared it wouldn&rsquo;t fit my off brand action camera, and it fits perfectly! I just need to figure out what every little piece is for (shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard once I apply myself)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-lot-of-stuff">A lot of stuff.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this kit for my husband for Christmas. LOL I think he became overwhelmed when he starting digging into everything that came with this kit. The funny thing is now, I need to buy him another case for all of the stuff that will not fit into this case when the camera is in it. This is pretty cool though, there are things in the kit that will encourage him to explore even more now. I also like the fact that the case is hard, gives me a little piece of mind that his GoPro is safe.</p>
