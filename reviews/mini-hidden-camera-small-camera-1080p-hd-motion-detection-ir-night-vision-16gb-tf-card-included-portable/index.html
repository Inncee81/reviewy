<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="finally-a-minicam-that-works">Finally a MiniCam that works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It actually works and it has intelligible instructions! I ordered one FSTCOM SQ8 that didn&rsquo;t respond per the viratually impossible to understand instructions after viewing a few Youtubes to see how one is supposed to operate it, , but it just didn&rsquo;t work. So, I ordered another one, following explicitly the YouTube demos, same story, and I returned it also. Great praise for Amazon&rsquo;s no hassle returns! So, I ordered this Milaloko and guess what: It works like it&rsquo;s supposed to! I obtained it to install on a radio control glider just to have some fun with it; haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fly it yet. Anyway, back to the instructions aspect. Generally, the products made over there are marvelous, but they run the risk of missing out because of poor instructions. It is absolutely essential that they employ people fluent in English to write their instructions. One can tell that they try very hard to explain things, but they really need some help in this area.</p>

<h5 id="fairly-good-video-but-complicated-to-set-correct-options">Fairly good video, but complicated to set correct options.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The cable that comes with it is quite unusual, a micro HDMI plug that goes in to the camera then splits into a standard USB and a composite Video out (yellow) plug. This can go straight into a TV of course.There is a time and date stamp on each video and image, but the camera only gets this from a text file which it will create on your micro SC card. To set it to the correct time you then have to edit that file on a PC; so unless you go to a lot of fuss each time you record something you are going to have the wrong time on the picture/video!The video and picture quality are OK. The camera focus is I think set to infinity so close up things are going to look a bit out of focus. There is no fish-eye lens effect so if you need to capture everything going on in a room this is not the camera for you. I found the video captured moving cars smoothly. I have uploaded two stills from the 1080p video option.The main difficulty is the programming! There are a lot of options with this camera - 720 &amp; 1080 video, 12MP camera, motion detection and night vision. All to be selected by different combinations of just two buttons on the camera cube. This would need some practise before you can be confident of setting it correctly in a real &lsquo;hidden camera&rsquo; situation.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="awesome-deal">Awesome Deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Wow, I am very impressed with this little beast of a camera. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect quality wise with this camera because it is so small. It is literally slightly shorter than the length of half of my finger. I assumed the quality wouldn&rsquo;t be too great but was proved wrong. This camera provides highly detailed pictures and videos. The audio is loud and can pick up from a distance. The small size is such a benefit because it makes it even more portable than our other action cameras. However, our other action cameras do not provide night vision. As you can see in the video, the night vision is enabled by infrared (which means there is no visible light), which is an added bonus for hunters as it will not scare game away or if you are using it as a security camera. It&rsquo;s small size makes for a great security camera as you can place it in unsuspecting areas and is easy to hide as well.Not only is the camera high quality, but it comes with everything you need including accessories, an sd card (which none of my cameras ever come with making this addition so convenient), a usb wire, and even a card reader (again none of my other cameras come with an sd card let alone a card reader). This is a snag of a deal for everything. I&rsquo;ve included pictures and a video. I didn&rsquo;t reset the date on the camera before shooting but it is very easy to modify (there&rsquo;s a time reset folder when you plug it into the computer) and the room I recorded in has low lighting but I just wanted to show you the detail this little gem provides.</p>

<h5 id="great-mini-camera-for-outdoor-adventures">Great mini camera for outdoor adventures</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I needed a small camera when I go hiking and this little camera just does that. Specially with motion detection and light weight, it is hardly noticeable. Just clip it on your clothing with the clip with came with. Or if you can strap to some head gear, it would be a better option of recording things at your eyes&rsquo; level.I had held the cam sideways so the picture and video are sideway.Since I am a visual person and there weren&rsquo;t pictures attached it instructions, I had a hard time understanding the instructions.</p>
