<p>The BKC UH-TK181 sit on top tandem kayak is adventure-ready. Grab a buddy and take a tandem kayak ocean fishing excursion. Paddle solo across the bay. Take it for a trip down a lazy river. Head out on the lake when the chop is up. The 12-foot five-inch UH-TK181 has the capacity to support plenty of weight and the space to hold plenty of gear. With its 34-inch beam, it has the stability and tracking to keep you balanced and on course even when the wind and water act up. And it has intuitive features that help make any outing a success; that goes for an afternoon fishing trip, a multi-day camping adventure, and everything in between. The UH-TK181 tandem kayak is nimble enough for a solo paddler and sturdy enough for two full-grown adults and their gear, with a 450-pound load capacity, so grab your gear and head for the launch with the best tandem kayak around. Why is it the best? Well, the adjustable fishing rod holders give you an edge when angling. The waterproof gear compartments keep valuables dry. The paddle rests let you go hands-free without ending up paddle-less. And as always, the Brooklyn Kayak Company includes two high-quality aluminum paddles and two deluxe kayak seats free with your purchase. You won&rsquo;t get far without a paddle, after all. We want you to be comfortable wherever the best tandem fishing kayak around takes you. And we&rsquo;ll throw in a comprehensive five-year warranty, too.</p>

<h5 id="stable-perfect-weight-water-tight-comes-with-all-your-accessories-easy-to-use-great-value">Stable, perfect weight, water tight, comes with all your accessories, easy to use - great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first Kayak purchase so take my review with a grain of salt as I don&rsquo;t have a ton of other product experience. All that said this thing feels like the perfect weight / balance mix. It&rsquo;s just light enough for me (5&rsquo;11&rdquo; / 182Lbs) to mount it on top of my FJ Cruiser without any help. On the water it feels stable. I&rsquo;ve been out twice now, both times fishing on a relatively calm lake&hellip; the first time was with a buddy who&rsquo;s about my same size. Our combined weight was about 360-370Lbs and it felt like the Kayak could have shouldered another 200Lbs no problem. The Pole mounts are easily removable and can adjust to your preference. I didn&rsquo;t find them getting in the way and we were managing 2 poles, a net &amp; both paddle sets. The paddles conveniently &amp; easily snap apart and can be mounted in slots right behind where you&rsquo;re sitting. This is great regardless of whether you&rsquo;re fishing (and catch something / need to put the paddle down) or if you&rsquo;re in another situation where you need to free up your hands. There&rsquo;s a nice sized open aired compartment in the back that comes with overhead netting. I had a small tackle box back there along with some other equipment, no problems.There are two water tight compartments that&rsquo;ll hold your phone, wallet, keys and a snack or two&hellip;there&rsquo;s one of these in front of each seat and it seems to be of fairly high quality.For now, I&rsquo;m in love! Very happy with the purchase and see this guy being put to use for many years ahead. BTW, shipping delivered on time &amp; was a joy to work with (they set up a time with you to take delivery)</p>

<h5 id="we-really-like-our-kayak">We really like our kayak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We really like our kayak. We found it to be very stable even with boat wakes and easy to fish from. It tracks and maneuvers well. I found the covers on the inset rod holders to be abut of a nuisance and the angle of the ones behind the front position to cause interference with paddling. All in all a great kayak for our use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-product-in-need-of-improved-peripherals">Quality Product In Need Of Improved Peripherals.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The kayak in and of itself is good. I&rsquo;ve taken it out twice with friends and have have a lot of fun. I don&rsquo;t have any comparison but we were moving more quickly than anyone else and one of us can take us where we need to go while the other fiddles with whatever they&rsquo;ve messed up.The issue is with the peripherals(and a nasty deep scratch it took when paddling to shore).As someone said, the paddles aren&rsquo;t that great. In my opinion they should be longer - I&rsquo;ll often hit either side as I paddle. As I read reviews prior to purchase this was to be anticipated - if you have two people you can just paddle to each side and make do.Second. On one side two of the the eyelets for the seats were gone after the drive home after the FIRST trip. As nothing is stripped it looks like they just fell out due to gravity and the vibrations caused by driving(the kayak sits more or less on its side on my rack). Needs threadlock.Third, the cord for the front and back handles is shoddy. The cord for the front broke when tying the kayak down to head home after the SECOND trip. I tied it down with some paracord and I&rsquo;m going to have to do that for the rear handle before I take this out again.So, it&rsquo;s fun, and it works, but unless you&rsquo;re driving thirty a short way down the road expect to lose a few things.I&rsquo;m out two eyelets and the cord for the handles, front and back.Regardless, I expect to enjoy this thing for years.Can you guys send me some new eyelets(and their plastic backings, and the screws)? :/ I&rsquo;ll take care of the threadlock and quality cord for the front and back handles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This kayak is great! Nice a stable and easy to maneuver in lakes and rivers. Highly recommend this brand and company. Delivery was as advertised. In terms of size, weight, etc&hellip;I load this kayak on my vehicle by myself, with the proper kayak rack attachments. When used with a kayak dolly, it is very easy to maneuver on land as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it, just don&rsquo;t tilt too far left or right, unless you wanna go swimming, it is a top sitting kayak, so this is isn&rsquo;t unusual for a kayak.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended">Highly recommended!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with the kayak. Stable as a fishing platform and easy to maneuver. The threaded inserts at the rear are useful in attaching a trolling motor mount. Multi-positionable rod holders and two dry wells are well designed and quite useful. Plan on adding additional padding to the seat bottoms if fishing longer than a couple hours. Overall a superb value for the money.</p>

<h5 id="great-kayak-for-the-price">Great kayak for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great kayak for the price. My wife and I love ours. Added Navilights and Raymarine Drangonfly imager and a few other extras and off we went. Sets well in the water with all our gear and us..about 340lb combined. Caught 10 keeper catfish and even got out of the vessel twice and re-entered while in shallow water and no problems with capsizing. No one else has mentioned it but mine came with pre-installed threaded bolt holes in the transom for a motor mount or other accessories so big plus. I spent weeks comparison shopping and as far as tandem kayak&rsquo;s with the listed accessories go, this one was the best bang for the buck. Now after receiving it and giving it the real life angler test I believe we made a good decision. Hey we caught fish and didn&rsquo;t turn over&hellip;.that&rsquo;s a great day of kayaking my friends!!</p>
