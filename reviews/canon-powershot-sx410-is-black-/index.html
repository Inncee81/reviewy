Canon PowerShot SX410 IS 20 Megapixel Compact Camera - Black 0107C001 Digital Cameras</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Amazing Results are Never Too Far Away</p>

<p>The PowerShot SX410 IS camera is packed with advanced Canon technologies that make it easy to capture your best images ever. The camera&rsquo;s powerful 40x Optical Zoom (24–960mm) and 24mm Wide-Angle lens gives you amazing versatility: you&rsquo;ll capture wide landscapes and zoom in for impressive close-ups you never thought possible – all with bright, clear quality thanks to Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer and Intelligent IS. The 20.0 Megapixel* sensor and Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor help create crisp resolution and beautiful, natural images. Your videos will impress too: simply press the Movie button to record lifelike 720p HD video – even zoom in and out while shooting. Images you&rsquo;ll want to keep and share are easy to achieve with Smart AUTO that intelligently selects proper camera settings so your images and video look great in all kinds of situations. You&rsquo;ll get creative with fun Scene Modes like Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect and Monochrome, and see and share it all with the camera&rsquo;s big, clear 3.0&rdquo; LCD with a wide viewing angle. For versatility and value, the PowerShot SX410 IS camera is a best bet!</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Extend Your Reach</p>

<p>40x Optical Zoom and 24mm Wide-Angle Lens
Once you start shooting with PowerShot SX410 IS camera, you&rsquo;ll quickly wonder how you ever did without the versatility of its powerful zoom lens. The 40x Optical Zoom lens has a reach all the way from 24mm to 960mm, so if you&rsquo;re capturing a child on stage from the back of the auditorium, you&rsquo;ll see her every expression. The Wide-Angle lens just as easily delivers superb landscapes and large group portraits. The Optical Image Stabilizer helps ensure you get clear, noise-free images, even at the long end of the zoom.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with PowerShot cameras, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, helping to eliminate the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Powerful Core Specs Deliver Beautiful Images
20.0 Megapixel* Image Sensor
The PowerShot SX410 IS camera&rsquo;s 20.0 Megapixel* CCD sensor delivers impressive photos with fine detail and brilliant color. The high resolution helps provide superb image quality even when cropping or making very large prints.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot SX410 IS camera&rsquo;s advanced functions and capabilities. Its accelerated processing speed creates fast, responsive performance, for a shooting experience that&rsquo;s easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality: processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by approximately 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations, and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor&rsquo;s highly efficient design also extends battery life.</p>

<p>Preserve and Share Your Memories in HD</p>

<p>Canon HD Video Advantage
The PowerShot SX410 IS camera lets you record highly detailed 720p HD video at up to 25 frames per second with clear sound. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot high definition video whenever you want, right from your compact digital camera.</p>

<p>Dedicated movie button, Wind Filter feature and Optical Zoom while shooting
The PowerShot SX410 IS camera has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The camera also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which helps suppress wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. You can even use the camera&rsquo;s full range of optical zoom when you&rsquo;re shooting a video without sacrificing HD video resolution.</p>

<p>A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos
Smart AUTO
Smart AUTO is a sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. It automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using predefined shooting situations*. The camera then makes optimal settings to help facilitate the best possible image capture, whether you&rsquo;re shooting stills or video. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<ul>
<li>32 predefined shooting situations for still images, and 21 predefined shooting situations for videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shooting Modes
PowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take impressive photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.</p>

<p>Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.
Live View Control   Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls.
Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Portrait    The camera sets a large aperture, focusing on the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject “pop.”

Low Light   For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Creative Filters    This setting provides easy access to special filter effects and scene modes, such as Toy Camera Effect, Poster Effect, Monochrome and more.
Fisheye Effect  Add a classic photo distortion without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect for Movies &amp; Stills    Emphasizes perspectives for a miniature effect by blurring upper and lower portions of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with “toy” or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Snow    Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.
Fireworks   Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.

<p>More Ways to Get Creative
Creative Shooting Modes
The PowerShot SX410 IS camera provides shooting modes that easily give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters. Super Vivid heightens and saturates colors for eye-popping intensity. Poster Effect eliminates gradations between colors for an illustrative feel. Miniature Effect enhances perspective in a scene, blurring the top and bottom to make it look as if it were created with miniature models. You can also make a quirky portrait using the Fisheye Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as if capturing the photo using a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; or pinhole camera.</p>

<p>See What You&rsquo;re Shooting on a Clear, Big Screen
Large 3.0-inch LCD screen
Easy to see from a wide angle, the camera&rsquo;s 3.0-inch LCD screen with a great resolution of approximately 230,000 dots gives you the big picture, whether you&rsquo;re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera&rsquo;s menu functions especially convenient.</p>

<p>A Charge that Lasts as Long as Memory
ECO mode
The PowerShot SX410 IS camera features ECO Mode to provide more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. The mode can be activated via a dedicated button for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won&rsquo;t miss the moment. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the evening, ECO Mode helps makes sure your camera keeps up.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Secure Grip
Canon developed an innovative grip for the PowerShot SX410 IS, optimized specifically for the camera&rsquo;s powerful zooming capability. The invitingly curved grip fits effortlessly into your hand. Without any strain, your fingers comfortably and naturally reach the shutter, helping to minimize the potential for shake at long zoom lengths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t tell you how wonderful this camera is! I don&rsquo;t understand why others are slamming it frankly it works just fine, better then fine really. You can see for yourself (see attached photos, shooting freehand, in auto mode), works far better then anything i&rsquo;ve picked up in this price range. 1:3 f-stop and the large glass, soaks up all the nighttime shooting you want&hellip; Daylight? Amazing too!</p>

<h5 id="if-you-re-reading-this-you-need-to-buy-this-camera">If You&rsquo;re Reading This, You NEED To Buy This Camera!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love so far! I&rsquo;ve had this camera almost 2 weeks now, and I could not be happier with it. I did originally want to buy a low-end DSLR camera to get into photography, however, money is an issue right now, so that wasn&rsquo;t an option. I still needed a new camera for the upcoming Otakon, and after reading a ton of reviews, I figured this would be my best option in my price range.First off, anyone who says they don&rsquo;t like the camera, obviously never got acquainted with all the settings and features on this camera. It has settings for daylight, inside lighting, moonlight, and every type of light in between; macro, portrait and landscape settings for the best clarity for the distance you&rsquo;re shooting at; color settings including vibrant, red, green or blue; you can adjust the flash and shutter speed depending on what you intend to shoot; it truly has all the bells and whistles you could possibly need for a point and shoot camera. In Auto mode, it decides for you which settings to use based on your surroundings. While it does a pretty good job on Auto, you will never get the full experience this way, and you will miss out on a lot of great photo ops. If you&rsquo;re not liking the way your photos are turning out, you&rsquo;re either looking for a professional&rsquo;s camera, or you&rsquo;re simply not using it properly. Don&rsquo;t let that scare you, though; I&rsquo;m technologically behind the times, and I was able to easily learn everything on this camera in just a few uses (I never cracked the manual, if it even came with one). Learn to use this camera and you will never stop enjoying it.My last camera was a 12MP I bought a few years ago. Going from that to this 20MP camera is mind-blowing. My old camera would never have been able to capture such clarity and vibrancy as this one does. I can&rsquo;t stop recommending it to people. The macro feature is able to photograph with amazing detail, even when something is close enough it is actually touching the lens. On the other hand, the 40x zoom is better than I could have ever imagined (I&rsquo;m attaching a photo of my friend on top of a huge rock at a waterfall so you can see how much detail you can capture with the 40x zoom). Please note: camera has trouble steadying the shot on Auto and at high zooms sometimes. If you plan on doing a lot of distance shooting, I recommend getting a tripod. I&rsquo;ve had so much fun learning to use this camera, I really can&rsquo;t wait to see how good my pictures from Otakon turn out.One of my favorite parts about this camera is the fact that it instantly turns on. If you need to grab your camera and snap a picture real quick, you absolutely can. The settings also load instantly, so it only takes a few seconds to get your camera perfectly set and ready to shoot wherever you are. I sadly have not gotten a chance yet to try out night shooting, and after seeing pictures others have taken of the moon, I really look forward to checking out this feature. I also haven&rsquo;t checked out the video camera option, and plan to look into that as well. As for the physical camera itself, I love the design and the way it fits in my hand. It&rsquo;s got the perfect hand grip, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it could fall out of your hand at all (I&rsquo;ve always been scared of dropping my old cameras because they&rsquo;re too slick). It comes with a lens cover, so you feel like a real photographer when you pull it out, and the flash can be popped up effortlessly. I feel like my money should not have been able to buy me such a sturdy-feeling, well-made camera (especially including the memory card it came with).Do yourself a favor. Buy this camera. Go out a few times with it and mess with the settings until you know what you&rsquo;re doing. Look for tutorials online if you must (I imagine they&rsquo;re out there). Once you know what this camera is capable of with the right settings, you will ask yourself why you didn&rsquo;t buy one of these sooner. Trust me, I&rsquo;m kicking myself for not upgrading years ago. I feel like I&rsquo;ve missed out on a lot of great shots (especially at Otakon) simply because I thought I couldn&rsquo;t afford such a quality camera.Keep in mind, I&rsquo;ve only had the camera 2 weeks, and I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of opportunities to take it out yet, so I don&rsquo;t have many pictures to share yet. But considering the few pictures I have taken, hopefully you&rsquo;re able to see just how beautifully this camera captures memories. Pictures included show: different shutter speed settings (waterfall), 40x zoom, macro shots (hermit crabs) and green hues in outdoor daylight (bridge).NEW PICTURES: Sylveon cosplay (slightly touched-up in Paint Shop Pro) - you can see how well the flash illuminated the subject in a very dark roomBee collecting pollen - Great detail with the macro, UNFORTUNATELY, you can see a &ldquo;ghost bee&rdquo;; the slower shutter speed wasn&rsquo;t fully able to capture the second bee as it flew out of the flower. But man, look at the detail on that pollen! Even the ghost bee is captured with full pollen detail!Abandoned House - While there was enough daylight to take pictures without the flash, the flash being used in such a wide-open space with no direct subject gave the image a great &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; feel, and with the flash I was able to capture more detail than without itRock formation - Even in conflicting light sources (shade and bright sunlight), I can still get great shots most of the timeCat - Macro shows amazing detail in the eyes and individual hairsThanks for reading, enjoy your camera! :)UPDATES:I&rsquo;m still in love with this camera. The slow shutter speed has unfortunately caused some problems at times, but I don&rsquo;t find it to be any slower than any other Point-and-Shoot camera I&rsquo;ve used, so I don&rsquo;t consider it a negative aspect necessarily, just an unfortunate trade-off of buying a basic camera. It&rsquo;s wonderful for portraits, and I love finding things to take macro pictures of! I feel much more like a real photographer with this camera, and maybe one day I&rsquo;ll be able to buy a professional camera. I&rsquo;ve also realized how much I love taking pictures for my Amazon reviews with this thing. They all look amazing, and I can much more easily capture the quality of the products I buy with this camera (especially useful when I buy a poor product and want to warn people).I haven&rsquo;t taken this thing out for an entire day yet, but when I do take it out, I turn it on and off constantly to save the battery just in case. It has yet to die on me while I&rsquo;m out (somehow, turning it on and off constantly doesn&rsquo;t seem to drain the battery at all, unlike most cameras). I&rsquo;m shocked at how long this battery can last when it&rsquo;s taking such detailed, vibrant pictures. I&rsquo;m uploading some more pictures to give an even better idea of the camera capabilities.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-for-the-price">Excellent for the Price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very impressed with this camera. I love all the great features, and the optical zoom. Photos and videos are crystal clear. I need macro for my work, and it takes great shots. The zoom is impressive. I took some moon shots with a tripod, and zoomed in to 30x and 40X. I was amazed at the detail I got of craters and mountains. The low light setting takes great low light pic&rsquo;s indoors and out. There are many effects, but I really like being able to shoot in B&amp;W And sepia. It&rsquo;s just and excellent camera, for the price!</p>

<h5 id="love-this-little-gem">Love this little gem!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this little gem!! I am using it when my DSLR is too bulky to carry with. Very user friendly, The lack of a viewfinder is not an issue. I have put a screen film covering over the back to see better in sunlight. As for battery life I would recommend keeping a back up one on hand. Which I would think is common knowledge with camera buffs. I wish I could add a picture I took with this camera. Would highly recommend this one!! I also love the red color!!</p>

<h5 id="the-perfect-camera">The PERFECT Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting into photography? But don&rsquo;t want to break the bank? Then this camera is for you! The Canon PowerShot SX410 IS boasts a 20mp wide angle lens with a built in 40x optical zoom&hellip;which we&rsquo;ll get to in a second. With only having this camera for about two weeks, I felt there needed to be a review for it. I cant begin to tell you how well it takes pictures. With 20mp you will literally capture EVERY detail there is, no matter what the zoom. Lets talk about that. I know what most people think when they hear zoom. They think a camera advertised with a very high zoom level is bogus. They think the pictures and videos will all be blurry..well..sorry..not with this camera.I do not know how canon did it but they did. They put some serious technology in this camera when it comes to the zoom. I have taken multiple pictures and videos using the 40x optical zoom and I was seriously blown away. No detail was lost, no pixilation what so ever. A picture taken at 40x looks like you got an extreme macro close-up, capturing all the detail. And of course this takes phenomenal pictures without the zoom which ill try to post. I mean the pictures literally look like they came out of a magazine.No me, I&rsquo;m not a camera expert at all. But this camera is perfect in every way. From the very light weight to its performance and price&hellip;it cant be beat. If you don&rsquo;t know how ISO and Exposure settings operate, then Canon provides the camera with the &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; mode which does what it says haha&hellip;it automatically chooses the best settings for any situations. Oh and I should mention, pictures taken in low light look like day time. And if you do know how to do all that professional camera stuff then you can tweak your own settings.I recommend getting two things that are necessary. One is an SD card, not micro. SD cards are memory cards needed to store pictures and videos. They are usually blue in color and small. Get a 32GB SanDisk SD cards, there $15. Next thing you need is a camera bag, which also cost $10-15. I really hope you get this camera because I think it is the most powerful and affordable cameras out there.If you would like, I actually have a YouTube channel were I posted a unboxing and review of the camera itself as well as show video taken with the 40x zoom and some sample pictures. Just search for &ldquo;Kollection King&rdquo; on YouTube and look for the videos there. SUBSCRIBE if you like.</p>
