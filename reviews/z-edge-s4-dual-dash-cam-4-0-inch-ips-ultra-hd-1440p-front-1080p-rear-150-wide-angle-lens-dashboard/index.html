<blockquote>
<p>I am giving this system 5 stars but not because I think it is the best you can get but because of its overall value, performance and really impressive customer service. The best compliment I can think to give a company is to buy from them again, and I did. I just bought a second unit for our other vehicle!First I need to say that the quality of video for both cameras is very good for something this size and in this price range. You aren&rsquo;t going to zoom in to a tight area and magically clear up a license plate recorded at a good distance but if its not too far away the cameras will see it fine. I read quite a few reviews on other cameras citing poor quality in the rear camera. I wanted the best in both directions. We were rear ended at a complete stop last week making this 3 times in 8 years so I decided to pull the trigger on this. It was on a lightning deal but with no reviews so I figured why not its Amazon I can return it if its not good.I bench tested it right away and was impressed with the video. It may be 1080 resolution but its not like a $50,000 HD TV camera so there will be artifacts due to compression. Still, I am impressed.Pros:1. Price - Lightning special priced it cheaper than the S3 for a bit.2. Size - Very small footprint3. Quality - The unit feels very sturdy but is light, the cameras are really good for such a small package. Image quality is good!4. Two HD cameras. Not many have HD for the rear, most are 640 x 4805. Battery - I bench tested it and it ran for an hour only making a couple of 5 minute looped videos before going dead. Given the documentation says 30 minutes I am making this a plus!6. Power Adapter - There are two USB ports on the power adapter. One listed as 2 amps so you can still run another USB device while occupying the power port in your car.7. Audio - Both cameras can and by default do record audio. I&rsquo;m not sure yet how good the back camera is for that since its inside if it could pick up what a person who rear ends you might be saying something such as &ldquo;Sorry, my bad I didn&rsquo;t see you there&rdquo;8. Audio can be disabled - You can turn off sound recording if that makes you uncomfortable or its illegal where you live.9. Cable length to rear camera and power cable length. There is at least 6 feet to spare to the back camera and I routed along the perimeter of my vehicle as well as a good 4 feet to the center console routed down the pillar for power!10. Extra mount and adhesive for front camera so yes, you could move it between cars if you used both mounts and had power and another rear cam for the other car.11. Very easy to install. You will have to pull out some snap on plastic covers (pillar etc..) for the most discrete install otherwise tucking it in here and there will get you by. I would caution that when running from front to back of the car if you have side curtain airbags you don&rsquo;t want to obstruct their deployment path with the wire!12. Piece of mind. Seriously, I would never have thought I would feel this much relief after installing this system. I live in a college town with newly licensed drivers showing up every year. 3 days in and I have 3 near misses recorded already!! I&rsquo;m going to make a &ldquo;Worst drivers of <my town> video one day I think!13. Makes you a nicer driver. Believe it or not knowing someone could see the video (and hear audio) one day has already made me a nicer driver!14. Great Customer Service - I asked at least 2 or 3 questions before receiving the unit and 3 after receiving and all were answered right away or within a day.Cons:1. Rear Camera is not waterproof so it can&rsquo;t be mounted outside. If you have rear tinted glass like I do this makes night images much darker BUT my tinted glass is not their fault but just FYI.2. Rear camera cable seems to be proprietary so you can&rsquo;t just go get another if something happens. I had an issue with the USB connector on mine which the company is making right. I will update if there are snags there.3. Power - They make it sound like the system &ldquo;detects&rdquo; the car is on or off when reading the description. It just comes on when power is present and goes off when its not unless you hit the parking mode button while its on then it runs off the battery until it drains or you restart the car.Recommendations to the manufacturer for what I would change on this system:1. I wish the included SD card was larger for more recordings but its working out so far. If not I have a 64GB class 10 laying around I can try.2. I wish the system had the option so it could be wired to an always on power source and a signal wire for key on as well as reverse signal wire. This would allow you to tap the park button without having to power from the battery for extended parking. Further with a reverse sensor it could throw up the rear camera image for reverse driving assistance while backing up automatically.3. This kind of replaces the last part of 2 but, I wish I could select the rear camera to be the primary displayed video and it would stay that way between power cycles. That would alleviate the need for reverse detection as you could set the rear screen on the display for 30 seconds and it would come on every time the vehicle is started for backup assistance. Right now I have to hit the down button twice every time I want to do that. Maybe a future firmware update could include this as it is connectable to a PC so I assume it can be updated that way?4. Automatically lock any recordings a couple of minutes before an impact and say 10 minutes after so that any &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; with the other driver is recorded. Too may times have I had people admit fault on scene and then lie later :( Right now you can select 1, 3 and 5 minute loops of recordings so if the incident happens at the tail end of a recording the next one won&rsquo;t be marked locked. To be fair though, all motion detected videos are recorded and kept lock just preserves them from being overwritten later. Personally I would pull the SD card after an incident to keep with me!My number 2 and 3 &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; items are for the more ambitions installers. I understand this system was built with simplicity and ease of installation in mind. I don&rsquo;t mind tapping in to wires or tracing them to get something working, plenty of folks would rather not.Finally, some may wonder why did I give them 5 stars if I had an issue with a cable? I believe that everyone makes mistakes now and again and it is not necessarily the mistake that defines a person but how they handle it afterwards. This company has been responsive and helpful throughout my experience with them and has offered to send me a new cable free of charge. That makes it right in my book and makes then a good place to do business with.I will update with cam video/photos as time passes.</p>

<h5 id="updated-review-after-customer-service">Updated review after Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera will get the job done, BUT there are some things you need to know before buying&hellip;#1. This Dash Cam is NOT compatible with SanDisk memory cards. It won&rsquo;t work, I tried. The camera does come with a 32gb micro SD card that IS compatible but if you want something bigger you will have to go spend more money.-#2. Event Marking: When you mark an event using the &ldquo;down arrow&rdquo; button a very, VERY small key icon appears in the center of the screen. This icon is nearly impossible to see which makes it difficult to determine whether the function has engaged correctly, especially while driving. It should be more easily visible. It would be better slightly enlarged and moved to the top of the screen next to the other icons where it is much more easily visible.#3. The Cord Positioning is Terrible: Having the plug for the power and rear camera on the top of the main camera prevents you from being able to mount it close to the headliner. You have to mount it about 1 inch down on the windshield because the plugs stick out so much on the top. Move the plugs to the side.#4. SD slot location: The slot for the SD card is located on the right hand side of the camera. When you mount the camera on the windshield, the rear-view-mirror blocks access to the slot making it difficult to access the SD card. This is where the cable inputs should be, the SD slot should be on the left where it is easily accessible.#5. Rear Camera Cord: On the plus side the cord is EXTREMELY LONG. However, the rear camera cord is attached to the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; of the rear camera. When mounting the rear camera, you want the cord to protrude from the top of the camera so that it can be hidden in the headliner. The way it is now, I have to mount the camera upside down in order to prevent the cord from dangling down. This is really dumb. If you want to be able to mount this rear camera properly and still be able to use the video that comes from it you should be prepared to edit the video to flip it right side up.#6. Screen brightness: The screen brightness on the main camera is far too dim and is not adjustable. Difficult to see during the day.#7. Screen polarized lens effect: When wearing polarized sunglasses the screen is oriented in such a way that it appears to be off when you are wearing polarized sunglasses. This is very annoying. This is the only screen I&rsquo;ve ever seen do this.- Most Rexing 1080p dash cams will give you a slightly better picture than this one will but this picture is totally usable. Although it&rsquo;s definitely not &ldquo;Super HD&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ultra HD&rdquo; (which is technically 4K which this camera is definitely not capable of) as the product description claims.- The audio quality of this camera is OUTSTANDING and is the best of any camera I have ever used.- The file and event saving works perfectly, splitting loop and event files into separate folders making them easy to access.- The big LCD screen is nice to have but I would rather have the smaller dash cam overall. This thing is HUGE!!!Overall this is a decent camera. Most dash cameras on the market are COMPLETE trash and this definitely stands out from those. I&rsquo;ve had over 15 dash cameras and this seems to be one of the better ones.</p>
