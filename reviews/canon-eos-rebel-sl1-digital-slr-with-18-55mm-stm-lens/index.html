And with the EOS Rebel SL1 you&rsquo;ll get Hybrid CMOS AF II, which provides the same fantastic performance as the original but boasts an increased AF area that covers approximately 80% of the sensor for easier composition. This performance is enhanced further by Canon&rsquo;s line of STM lenses, which provide smooth and quiet operation.</p>

<p>Complex Functions Made Simple.
Scene Intelligent Auto mode
The EOS Rebel SL1 features Scene Intelligent Auto mode, which incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation. Users without extensive photography knowledge or experience will not need to puzzle over settings; the Scene Intelligent Auto mode simplifies DSLR image capture so photographers can simply concentrate on composing images.</p>

<p>Creative Features, Amazing Images.
Advanced Creative Filters that can be displayed in real time during Live View shooting
Adding to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS Rebel SL1, the camera offers seven different creative filters for still images: Art Bold Effect, Water Painting Effect, Miniature Effect, Fisheye Effect, Grainy B/W, Soft Focus and Toy Camera Effect.

The result is previewed on the LCD screen, so users can see in advance how their final image will look. Plus, a new Effect Shot feature automatically captures two shots simultaneously: one without effect, and one with a preselected Picture Style or Creative Filter effect. This makes it easy to see how each effect changes the photo without compromising the original image. Effect Shot mode is available in both Live View and viewfinder-based shooting, and can easily be viewed immediately in playback mode.</p>

<p>The Right Mode for the Right Situation.</p>

<p>New Special Scene Modes: Kids, Food and Candlelight
The EOS Rebel SL1 has three new easily accessible scene modes to capture the perfect image the first time. Kids mode ensures high-speed shutter priority, focus tracking, healthy skin tones and flash when needed; Food mode delivers bright, vivid food images, limits flash by default and limits the red tint often associated with &ldquo;restaurant plate&rdquo; photography. With Candlelight mode, the camera will take care not to blow out the scene, maintaining the glow of the candle, leaving the flash off and reducing exposure fluctuation.</p>

<p>Flexible and Reliable Recording.
Compatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, including Ultra High Speed cards
The EOS Rebel SL1 uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC, and is even compatible with Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the camera&rsquo;s compact design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im a casual photographer, who travels a lot and wanted a SLR to take with me. I also want to enhance my photography as a hobby, although I don&rsquo;t plan on ever being professional. I&rsquo;ve owned several compact digital prior to this camera.Size:Even though I knew what I was ordering, I couldn&rsquo;t get over the size. It&rsquo;s so small for an SLR and so lightweight. I&rsquo;ve checked multiple times because I didn&rsquo;t think it was loaded in my bag, it felt empty. No kidding, it&rsquo;s that light weight. But still has all the buttons you need, well placed and easy to operate. It also feels tough and durable, so don&rsquo;t be dissuaded by the light weight or small size. I&rsquo;m not sure about the concern some voiced about it being &ldquo;too small&rdquo; to hold. It&rsquo;s very comfortable. If you are going to shoot for 2 hours straight and/or have shot with a larger camera for 5 years, then maybe this would take some getting used to. But it&rsquo;s very easy to manage, comfortable to hold and feels solid in my hand.Performance:I&rsquo;ve been experimenting for a couple months now with various settings, different creative shots and I love the camera. Any failures are certainly mine as an amateur. It&rsquo;s easy to shoot, fast enough (I&rsquo;m not shooting for the NHL) and takes accurate, colorful pictures that are only limited by my creativity. I&rsquo;ve shot macro, landscape, architecture, pets and portraits. I love it. It has a deep, feature rich set of custom options, menus and settings. I&rsquo;m almost addicted to loading my amazing photos into a post photo software (name omitted) and playing with them to see how incredible they can get. That being said, they look incredible (when composed properly) straight from the RAW image. Also remember, this is a canon, so you can use virtually any lens ever created by them.Video:The improved AF Focus and STM lens is evident when shooting video. Video is amazingly clear, the AF does a good job keeping up with most subjects (again not shooting NHL or nocturnal animal scenery). The touchscreen, nearly silent lens combo is a huge improvement over prior versions. All but the most demanding professionals will find it does a remarkable job.Cons:Not many, seriously.No built in stereo mic..(minor issue use an external)No built in wifi (use an eye fi card)I kept this simple as there are some more technical reviews out there. I thought simple usage from a consumer standpoint would be most helpful. My advice, be very careful hanging your hat on some of the Amazon reviews that are overly technical. Some of the reviewers don&rsquo;t know as much as they pretend and quote erroneous facts, like the fact that this camera uses &ldquo;contrast phase detect&rdquo; for it&rsquo;s auto focus. Wrong, older canon&rsquo;s did, not this one. If you really need the technical details read a review by dpmag, dppreview, camera labs etc. They will be spot on accurate and not a pseudo professional opinion. Happy hunting&hellip;If you found this helpful, please click yes! Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very compact DSLR similar in ability and layout to a Rebel T2i/T3i for stills. Enhanced autofocus has made it Canon&rsquo;s best DSLR for point-and-shoot style movies (superseded by the 70D in 2014). Paired with small primes, it makes for an exceedingly capable travel camera. Larger kits can make the T5i preferable. Smaller kits come more readily from mirrorless cameras with smaller senors.==== Rebel T5i:18 MP5 fps9-point AF w/ 9 cross pointsHybrid AF w/ 9% frame coverage1080p/30, 720p/60Articulating touchscreenStereo mics13m flash range20 oz==== Rebel SL1:+ 14 oz, 30% smaller by volume+ Hybrid AF w/ 64% frame coverage&ndash; 4 fps&ndash; fixed touchscreen&ndash; 9 point AF w/ 1 cross point&ndash; 9.4m flash range&ndash; mono micDIFFERENCES:* Size.This is the smallest DSLR from any make. It&rsquo;s a whole size tier below the T5i and level with a number of mirrorless bodies. Whether that&rsquo;s a worthwhile ergonomic compromise depends on the use case. With a small lens like a <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8, the combined package reduces to prosumer point-and-shoot dimensions. Anything more ample (even the kit 18-55) and the bulk of the lens rapidly offsets the SL1&rsquo;s space efficiency.In-hand, the SL1 is a fingertip camera. The palm of my large right hand doesn&rsquo;t rest easily against the body without finger contortions, so support comes mostly from the left under the lens. It feels (and looks) lilliputian if you&rsquo;re used to larger DSLRs, but that&rsquo;s the only real adjustment; the button layout has no surprises relative to the T2/3/4/5i.* Single cross-point AF.First, context: Canon uses autofocus to differentiate between DSLRs. More expensive cameras tend to have &lsquo;better&rsquo; autofocus. Precisely what that means, and whether it matters, depends on your requirements. With the addition of movie capability, we&rsquo;ve got three parameters to consider: stills with static subjects, stills with movement, and movies with movement. A complicating factor is that performance depends greatly on whether you&rsquo;re shooting through the viewfinder or from the rear LCD (&ldquo;Live View&rdquo;). Unlike point-and-shoot and mirrorless bodies, Canon DSLRs (and all others save Sony&rsquo;s) have two entirely separate autofocus systems.When I talk about &lsquo;phase-detect&rsquo; AF and &lsquo;cross-points&rsquo;, these are characteristics of the viewfinder AF system. The SL1&rsquo;s phase-detect AF array has 9 points. Only the center point is a cross-point. Cross-points (shaped like a +) detect contrast in any orientation. The 8 outer points (shaped like lines) only see contrast that&rsquo;s near perpendicular to them. The practical implication is that the T4i/T5i will be somewhat faster and more consistent with off-center compositions with wide-aperture lenses (e.g., <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.8) and motion-tracking.Both systems outperform the contrast-detect focus in any current mirrorless body with motion. You focus through an optical viewfinder that&rsquo;ll never wash out, show noise in dim lighting, lag the action, or smear colors. In exchange, you lose the clever information overlays of electronic viewfinders (EVF), the face tracking that&rsquo;s become a part of many contrast-detect systems, and the precise matching between what the EVF shows and the camera records.Here&rsquo;s the phase-detect breakdown for this body:VF, stills, static: fast and accurate in frame-centerVF, stills, movement: moderately fast and accurate in frame-centerVF, movies, any subject: not possibleThis is the same AF array as in the T2i/T3i. If you were happy with those bodies, you&rsquo;ll be equally so with this one.* Hybrid AF II.In the T3i and prior, Live View focusing from the rear LCD was achieved by contrast-detect. This method is vastly slower than phase-detect and, in Canon&rsquo;s DSLR implementation, isn&rsquo;t capable of tracking motion in movies. It&rsquo;s reasonably quick and quite accurate with stills. It isn&rsquo;t possible to use the main phase-detect array without interrupting Live View because a mirror gets in the way.The T4i/T5i added a second phase-detect system integrated into the imaging sensor itself that boosted acquisition speed and improved motion tracking to mediocre/adequate levels, but only for the center 9% of the frame. The SL1 expands this system to 64% frame coverage. The result is significantly more confidence with continuous autofocus in movies. With off-center subjects, it hunts (bringing the scene in and out of focus) much less than the T4i/T5i.Here&rsquo;s the contrast-detect breakdown:LV, stills, static: reasonably fast and accurate over the whole frameLV, stills, movement: slow, accurate when it can keep upLV, movies, static: reasonably fast, occasional huntingLV, movies, movement: slow, accurate when it can keep upMotion tracking is still short of exceptional. STM lenses (which use a stepper motor instead of standard USM or a noisy micro-motor) work more quickly and precisely than non-STM lenses. They&rsquo;ll track slow, undemanding subjects and faces. For more challenging movement, either prefocus, manually focus, or jump to the next performance tier comprised of Sony&rsquo;s &lsquo;translucent mirror&rsquo; DSLRs, many mirrorless bodies (e.g., Panasonic G/GH), and Canon&rsquo;s own 70D. The SL1 has no focusing aids (e.g., focus peaking) for Live View except full-screen zoom. Focusing accurately by hand on a moving target is very challenging.OTHERWISE:Everything else is to lesser consequence. A slightly weaker flash, a slightly slower framerate, a smaller battery, one less microphone channel. Even the loss of LCD articulation isn&rsquo;t much of a bother unless you&rsquo;re continually shooting from vantage points away from the viewfinder.A major advantage of the SL1 is that, like the T4i/T5i, it has a new touchscreen that that significantly lowers the EOS learning curve. It&rsquo;s capacitive and almost as responsive as a modern smartphone. Adjusting functions (e.g., exposure, white balance, focus points; everything) is as simple as tapping what you want. The camera won&rsquo;t be at the ready when you&rsquo;re manipulating the LCD, but thanks in part to an integrated &lsquo;feature guide&rsquo; that explains most options, you probably won&rsquo;t need to pull out the manual on first acquaintance.Phone gestures (e.g., pinch zoom, swiping) are now part of the picture review system, which makes checking focus vastly quicker and more flexible than on any other non-touch EOS body. Focus itself is touch-enabled in Live View mode, so you can tap to focus on static subjects anywhere in the frame without ever having to manipulate the 9-point AF system.The interface isn&rsquo;t necessarily intuitive, but photography in general isn&rsquo;t intuitive. There&rsquo;s a large gulf between a design for novice users that hides complication and one for experienced users that makes powerful features easily accessible. By offering redundant touch controls, Canon straddles this line surprisingly well. This is a camera that can grow with you.STILLS QUALITY:This sensor is functionally identical to those in the T2i/T3i/T4i/T5i/60D/7D save for the pixels devoted to phase-detect. Noise and dynamic range are similar in raw. Expect acceptable results up to ISO 3200. Nikon&rsquo;s D5100 is slightly better, Sony&rsquo;s A65 slightly worse. It&rsquo;s about two solid stops better than a typical point-and-shoot.Unless you&rsquo;re in a JPEG-only shooting mode (e.g., multi-shot NR, HDR), raw gets the most out of this camera. JPEG often lacks the flexibility for significant changes in post. Raw shooting also lets you defer decisions (e.g., white balance, sharpening, noise reduction, color, lens corrections, tone curves, and even exposure) that distract from catching whatever moment you&rsquo;re after.That aside, if your scene and shooting technique don&rsquo;t call for major adjustments on the computer, you&rsquo;re likely to be pleased with the JPEG output.LENSES:The 18-<sup>55</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.5-5.6 STM is a stellar optic. Focus is as fast as the camera allows, near-silent, and inaudible in movies, as is the IS system. If you upgrade, it&rsquo;ll be for speed, a different range, or perhaps more contrast, not because it isn&rsquo;t sharp enough. The 18-<sup>135</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.5-5.6 STM is equally impressive, though about an inch longer and twice the weight.Light and small primes are well-suited to this body. The <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8 STM, <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.8, <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.8, and <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8 are all more compact than the kit lens. Larger lenses work as with any other EOS body, though some will be slightly more awkward when you&rsquo;re trying to adjust the zoom ring and support the rig from under the lens at the same time.ACCESSORIES:For video, buy SD cards 32 GB or larger. My pair of 16 GB cards have been inadequate for even a one-day event. The highest recording quality uses 350 MB/minute, equating to about 90 minutes per 32 GB card. For stills (~7 MB in JPEG and ~25 MB in raw), two or three 8 GB cards is plenty.Interface responsiveness isn&rsquo;t much affected by card speed. Faster cards have three advantages: they can shoot longer bursts at 4 FPS, clear the picture buffer more quickly, and record video at the highest quality without risking a speed warning. Buffer depth is 28 JPEGs and 7 raw files with a standard SD card. Buffer cycling times are much lower with UHS-1 (&lsquo;Ultra High Speed&rsquo;). In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.If you buy protection filters for your lenses, try Hoya&rsquo;s &ldquo;DMC PRO1 Clear Protector Digital&rdquo; line. They have very high light transmission and cause no visible flare. Digital sensors filter UV natively, there&rsquo;s no reason to pay more for that feature. I&rsquo;ve written reviews on the relevant Hoya product pages with more details and why you might (or might not) want a filter.IN SUM:Whether this DSLR is your huckleberry depends on your priorities. This is new territory for Canon. The SL1 is sized to compete with mirrorless, but the EOS lens line doesn&rsquo;t have many compact options to pair with it. And it never will, because the SL1 uses an APS-C sensor, the second-largest available. That applies doubly for Canon&rsquo;s mirrorless EOS-M, which looks like a deck of cards beneath an Evian bottle when attached to any of the f/2.8 zooms or longer telephotos.Canon&rsquo;s lens line is simultaneously the greatest strength and weakness of this body. The EOS mount makes accessible some extraordinary and unique high-dollar glass. If you want to shoot supertelephotos, or real tilt-shift, or superfast primes that see in the dark, or macro lenses that&rsquo;ll fill the frame with Roosevelt&rsquo;s head on a dime, there&rsquo;s no other system that has it all under one umbrella. And if you&rsquo;ve already invested in it, the SL1 is the obvious choice.But what if that&rsquo;s not you? What if you plan to stay with the general-purpose lenses that just about every system contains? The advantages of the SL1 narrow considerably. They are: subject isolation, motion tracking with stills, the immediacy of an optical viewfinder, and Canon&rsquo;s highly polished user interface.Relative to a M4/3s body like Panasonic&rsquo;s G6, the SL1 will have more foreground and background blur at any given aperture. If you&rsquo;re all about creamy backgrounds for portraiture, the difference is noticeable. You can still isolate with M4/3s, it just takes a closer subject and more telephoto.Motion tracking for stills used to be a huge arrow in the SL1&rsquo;s quiver. It still is relative to most mirrorless bodies, though recent ones have gotten surprisingly fast. Likewise for low-light focusing, formerly a mirrorless weakness. Still, if your subjects are often running children, or anything that moves toward or away from you at high speed, the SL1 will have a higher hit-rate.The optical viewfinder is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you&rsquo;re seeing the scene in real-time with no processing delays from imaging hardware. On the other, you&rsquo;re not seeing what the camera sees. The DSLR shooting process involves a lot of chimping, where you take the shot with the viewfinder and immediately check the exposure with the rear LCD. Not so with mirrorless: what you see is what you get, for better or worse. The SL1 finder maintains an edge with fast action and in very dark conditions that&rsquo;ll cause OLED/LCD viewfinders to fade to black.And then we have Canon&rsquo;s UI. They&rsquo;ve polished it for thirty years and the effort shows, particularly relative to recent entrants like Sony&rsquo;s NEX line. But Panasonic and others are closing the gap. This SL1 isn&rsquo;t the only camera with a touchscreen and logical menus. More to the point, mirrorless bodies are often less clunky than the strange amalgam of &lsquo;Live View&rsquo; and traditional mirror shooting that defines this camera and other DSLRs. That may well consume the SL1&rsquo;s advantage.So what conclusions?If you&rsquo;re all about small size and you can sacrifice the SL1&rsquo;s advantages, mirrorless is where you want to be. The Olympus OM-series leads the pack now in this price range. Tomorrow, the leader may be something else.If you want to pair this body with fast, high-dollar EOS lenses or bulky accessories like an external flash, the T5i is a better alternative. The cost difference disappears into the system cost. The SL1 maintains an advantage with continuous focus in movie-mode, but lags everywhere else.If you want the smallest possible EOS-compatible body, the EOS-M has identical image quality in a truly miniature package. After a recent firmware update, it&rsquo;s now acceptably fast at focusing, though still well behind the SL1 in general responsiveness.But if your priorities favor DSLRs, hands-off autofocus in movies, and small size, the SL1 is the best choice in Canon&rsquo;s arsenal. A compromise, yes, but a good one.</p>
