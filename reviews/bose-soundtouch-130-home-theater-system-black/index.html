<p>From unexpected plot twists to complex characters, there&rsquo;s a lot to love about TV shows and movies. Especially the sound. With the Bose Sound Touch 130 home theater system, the sound bar delivers clear, spacious sound all across your room, while the wireless Acoustic mass module provides impactful bass even if you hide it out of sight. It&rsquo;s also a powerful music system, letting you easily enjoy wireless music when connected to your existing home Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth devices. Stream music services like Spotify and Pandora, Internet radio stations or your own stored music library. A small control console with four HDMI inputs ensures you hear the movie or soundtrack the way it was meant to be. Conventional systems that connect only to your TV&rsquo;s audio output can&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;re getting the best possible audio experience from your source devices. A universal remote is included as well to simplify your everyday experience. Included: Sound Touch 130 sound bar speaker; wireless Acoustic mass module; Sound Touch wireless adapter; control console; universal remote control; HDMI cable.</p>

<h5 id="sweetness-in-the-sound-forget-sonos-denon-etc-reviewed-after-6-months-of-use">Sweetness in the sound, forget Sonos, Denon, etc. (reviewed after 6 months of use)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Background:1) I spent weeks visiting various stores to listen to each vendor over 5-10 times each! The list included Bose, Sonos, Martin Logan, Klipsh, Denon Heos, Definitive, Polk, etc. The decision was made after several hours of listening. This review is after 6 months of ST130 use (along with my ST30 and ST20)2) I listen to a very wide variety of genres: Acoustic, Rock, Alternative, New Country, Electronic, Jazz, New Age, Reggae, Chill, and some international genres.3) I am an audiophile, low tolerance for low-resolution music or systems that render poorly. My primary use is music, though I use it to see movies too.Summary:This was a clear winner for me for price vs. sounds quality and wireless features. Martin Logan wins on performance but not overall given the price point, more on that later. Get Sonos only if really need every feature, Boss has many essential features and integration needed.Details:1) Music Quality: This was my number 1 criteria. I have to love the sound else it&rsquo;s not a candidate. Bose is really good with vocals. They do a nice job with treble too. Their bass is good and acceptable, not thumping or deafening, but really depends on source quality too. If you listen to HipHop and have 128-mp3 quality music, you could be disappointed. But when put all together, Bose really does superb job of a balanced clear (really CLEAR) beautiful sound. See attached video, with bass test on glass of water. Every word is clear. Every tone can be heard. You can play at volume level 10% or 90%, its clear clean sound, pleasing to the ears (unlike other systems that can get harsh). I love that! Note, its WAY TOO LOUD at 90%. Martin Logan was my favorite but I had two concerns with ML, one was price and two was wired/wireless capabilities. Sonos is not audiophile quality. Sonos is a software company not an audio company, more on that later.2) Wireless Capabilities and iPhone App: The reason I looked at these soundbars was due to their wireless capabilities, extensiblity, ease of install and multi-room audio. Sonos is the clear winner when it comes to multi-room play, joining speakers in different configuration, and app control. Sonos understands what it takes to build good apps and network connectivity. Bose app looks like Windows 95 and network connectivity is be buggy. Sonos has more integration capabilities than Bose, particularly Apple Music. Other vendors are far behind these two. Bose has been trying to catch up, but they release an update in 4-6 months, whereas I&rsquo;ve heard Sonos releases very frequently. But is Bose app and network really bad as some complain? IMO, no. In fact, its good. It’s not great but its good. I control 3 different Soundtouch systems (130, 30, 20) from my iPhone app and seamless play music very easily. Bose has the famous 6 shortcuts and I find it VERY handy. Start playing any of your 6 fav playlist/stations in 1 touch (especially from ST30/20). That is really handy, especially in morning when you don’t want to fiddle with an app. Bose has Spotify Connect integration, which means I can play music at home remotely even when I am not at home using my Spotify app! Hopefully Bose will add the same for Apple Music (Note, Sonos was first/quick to add). One note, their app used to be buggy and would restart menu each time you loaded. They recently fixed it and now the app is much more usable.3) Integration: Bose connects to Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, iHeartRadio, SirrusXM, iTunes, local DLNA (limited, I use Bubble PNP server on Android tablet). I just use Spotify (need Premium account) and DLNA (via my android tab). I really wish they didn&rsquo;t remove Apple AirPlay in their gen 3 line (called Series III, which is this ST130). My ST20 and ST30 are Series II, which still has Airplay.4) Multi-room: works fine with spotify, itunes, dlna. Can use BT on ST130 but I hate BT for music (personal preference). Cannot multiroom with Airplay, which I dislike. I&rsquo;ve been hearing that Aux play will be support multi-room but the update is due for over 6 months.5) Looks: Do you care? Well, if you do then you are in luck because all of their units look sleek and sexy, especially ST130.Friends&rsquo; reaction: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe how loud and clear the sound is from ST 130, with such a small footprint in the living room&rdquo;. Parties have been fun!Bottom line: If you want multi-room, clear, sweet sound then this unit is for you. Get a ST30 or ST20 or ST10 to accompany them. If you want tons of features but not crazy about audiophile quality sound then get Sonos. If you want very heavy bass then go for Definitive or Polk or alike with separate big subwoofer. 6 months of use and I am glad I spent money on it. I went and got my ST30 and ST20 after ST130 and glad to have this combination.Tip1: Place your ST130 woofer next to wall, this will help enhance the bass and make it adequate for all genres except HipHop.Tip2: If you have a Bose factory store, they have discounts on Series II ST 20 (previous gen), you could grab one while stock lasts.</p>

<h5 id="great-system">Great System</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that &ldquo;friends to not let friends buy Bose.&rdquo; This is my third Bose system, and I could not be happier. I surrounded my TV with these speakers; and I can now hear the dialog as well as the music. Music, regardless of the source, is full fidelity. I like, too, that I can control this system with most any remote, with my cell phone, or with my computer. Upgrading the firmware is simple and largely automatic. As the system is attached to my WiFi, it plays music from any and all other devices on my network. Why not buy Bose?</p>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great sound</h5>

<p>We had been in the dark ages of using very old speakers for the TV in our family room. We are thrilled with the sound quality of this product.</p>

<h5 id="expected-bose-quality">Expected Bose Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality of Bose products never ceases to amaze. This system is surprisingly clear and fills the room with only two speakers. Beware though, if your subwoofer cuts out, it may be a result of the wi-fi adapter. It causes interference with the signal. After unplugging it, I have had no issues since.</p>

<p>Love it. Best sound quality you could get. It will do a great job with sound effects either in your living room being so compact or in a home theater competing with any 5.1 systems out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing technology from Bose! Satisfied to have made a good decision. Easy to setup and powerful sound. You can enjoy different internet radio stations at the touch of a button on your phone. The universal remote is good too. I recommend this product to anyone who desires a touch of elegance.</p>
