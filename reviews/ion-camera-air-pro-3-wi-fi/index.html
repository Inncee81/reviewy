<blockquote>
<p>After a full days use on my motorcycle, on and off road, I can easily say there are only a couple of things that I don&rsquo;t like about it. Over all it was a good purchase considering I got it here NEW on Amazon for $190.00!! Well worth $190.00.Pro&rsquo;s: Excellent video/picture qualityWaterproofInstalled mic is ok but I used an external mic which works great!Love the way that it mounts to my helmet with the side-ball mountField of view is niceSolid buildNice colors with the blue and blackTakes up to a 64gig memory card2.5-3hr battery life without Wi-Fi turned on (lasted all day!)The vibration against the helmet when turning it on, recording or shutting it down took out all of the guess work as to what mode the camera was in&hellip;VERY COOL! (And easy to operate with gloves on)Cons: Very noticeable wash out when operating in shadow and bright backgrounds (sitting in the shadows, the outside surroundings may as well not even be there however the shadow areas are nicely in view vs. blacked out.Wi-Fi view on my android was tiny. The ION APP for this is kind of crappy!Once the battery is gone…the camera is goneFor me the Pro&rsquo;s outweigh the Con&rsquo;s. It works for me</p>

<h5 id="amazing-absolutely-amazing">AMAZING. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>AMAZING. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. After reading about how difficult previous version of this camera were to set up, I was very surprised at how incredibly simple the set up was. The manual was very straight forward. Everything worked perfectly, and the total set up time took about 5 minutes. The manual that it comes with is a little out-dated however; as the camera does support the 128 GB micro SD cards (while the manual says that it only supports 64 GB cards). Picture quality was fantastic while I have not fully tested the internal microphone to see how sensitive it is, it appeared to work very well.This is the camera to get if you want to have an incredible video camera coupled with the ability to take excellent still photos. I am just astounded at what an incredible piece of technology this camera is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can only give it three because of the problems I had. Defective charger is what I suspect. I love the idea of what it can do over go pro but it just has to come thru with the what it says she will do. I bought another one and return this one in the hopes the next one will be better.Extra&hellip;Thought I could just remove chip and download to iPhone. Didn&rsquo;t work. 44 files and only got one. Not happy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m downgrading to 3 stars.You know, I had a Polaroid 100XS and I thought &lsquo;that&rsquo; camera was better compared to the iON.The colors don&rsquo;t come through that good and the audio is annoyingly muted.I&rsquo;m debating about upgrading to 4 stars instead of 3 due to its rugged design and ability to survive shocks, but I&rsquo;m not feeling generous towards iON because of the picture quality. It really could be better.</p>

<p>The camera did not work up on arrival camera was defected, would not charge,would not record longer then 5min and the wifi pod would not conect to wifi.Seller was great for handling the return and refunding my money</p>

<h5 id="solid-camera-no-problems-so-far">Solid Camera - No problems so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera is fine. A little heavy compared to the GoPro. The only issue is it is hard to get all of the independent accessories since the mounting system is different from the GoPro. Wish they would offer their own conversion mounts using their plug in clip, which I like. Good to have the 120 fps. Mic could be a bit more sensitive. App is weak and old. And it does not always transfer the whole video. But connect to a PC and it acts as a simple USB drive. Works finite with 64 GB cards. Only peav is that it does not have a lens cap. No idea why since the lense is exposed and I don&rsquo;t want to get it scratched when storing it.</p>

<h5 id="will-be-great-when-the-software-is-fully-refined">Will be great when the software is fully refined</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a camera that was standalone waterproof, without any enclosure, and the iON fit that bill. It provides a good picture and was easy to learn. However, it has at least one significant hitch. On two occasions, when using the wifi feature (which is nice) to frame my shot with my iPhone, I noticed that when the wifi was turned off, the camera turned off. When the camera was turned on with the slide switch to record the event for which it was set-up, the camera came on (at least the light) but did not enter recording mode, and on at least one of the occasions had to be reset to get it to respond. Needless to say, the record of the event was lost. Only one, as I was primed to correct it on the second. On at least two occasions where I staged a test to replicate the occurrence, all went as normal, so this appears to be unpredictable. This is a major handicap, as the reason for wanting the wifi capability was to allow me to properly frame a recording where the camera is mounted in a remote and/or high noise location where I cannot detect the vibes.The software is up to date. I am keeping the camera, but will have to live with the unknowns, unless and until they are corrected.NOTE: Minimizing wind noise with this camera is a bit of a challenge, as the entire outer surface of the camera seems to conduct sound to the mic. I have been able to compensate for this by enclosing the camera (all but the lens that is 8^) is a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; foam casing with a slit in the bottom for the mount. The rubber skins have this effect to a small extent, but not near as effectively as the foam. The operation of the button and the slide on the top is still relatively normal through the foam layer. The foam must come as far forward as possible to maximize effectiveness.</p>
