<h5 id="good-choice-for-a-corner-mount">Good choice for a corner mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had this product for a week now and it&rsquo;s been great! I was unsure if I should get it considering that I needed a corner mount but I read the reviews and q &amp; a section and saw someone had used it for that purpose and it worked out for them. Well I&rsquo;m happy to say that I had it mounted on the corner and it has worked well for me as well. I mounted it on the left side of the corner where I wanted the tv and it&rsquo;s perfect there. I didn&rsquo;t want to get a transitional corner wall mount because you need to hang on both sides of the walls and I&rsquo;m in a rental apt so I didn&rsquo;t want to have to worry about so many holes in the walls in the case I ever move. I can snuggle the tv and adjust it right up against the wall or move it around a bit (depending where I&rsquo;m on the couch in sitting) and it&rsquo;s perfect viewing. The only thing is that when it&rsquo;s not snug against the wall it&rsquo;s a bit further out closer to the viewer than the wall. This would have been a concern for me because I have a 50&rdquo; but the corner in my apt is wide enough that it doesn&rsquo;t block the door frames (which can be seen in the pics). The only concern I have about this mount is that I bought a Sony Bravia Android TV W800C and it covered the cable inputs (luckily for me I&rsquo;m not using it but that would be an inconvenience for someone else and should be considered if purchasing this product since most Sony tv&rsquo;s are similar in the back). I love that it came with a complementary hdmi cable which was great because I needed it for my Apple TV (no, the irony of having an android tv and purchasing an Apple TV has not escaped me lol). Another concern I had was the actual mounting which was not something that could be done with just two people, it requires three people for a tv as big as mine so I just wanted to put that out there.</p>

<h5 id="killer-product-installed-it-by-myself-and-added-a-sonos-soundbar-to-make-it-extra-interesting">Killer product: Installed it by myself&hellip; and added a Sonos soundbar to make it extra interesting.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I never mounted a TV alone before. Having moved to a new city with some time on my hands and massive ambition, I decided to mount our 42&rdquo; TV by myself. I know folks usually recommend this to be a two person job, but after reviewing the single stud design, tv bracket hook system, the numerous positive (easy installation) reviews and the NBA finals on that night&hellip; I ventured off alone.To make things even more complicated for a TV installation newbie, I was also going to mount my Sonos Playbar underneath the TV. So, if the TV moves, the soundbar moves. Not going to lie, between the weight of the TV and the heavy Sonos playbar, I was maxing out the listed &lsquo;load&rsquo; of the TV mount.A few hours later, which included a Best Buy and hardware store run to find missing parts and extra human caution, the mount was up&hellip; TV, soundbar and all. Considering it was my first time and I was by myself, it couldn&rsquo;t have been easierIt&rsquo;s been 2 weeks since, the full motion truly is full motion. After some break-in, it&rsquo;s easier to use than ever, and the mount against the wall looks and feels like one of the most secure items in my apartment&hellip; probably is&hellip; the mount feels like a fixture.I couldn&rsquo;t recommend this more.. and for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the price of a comparable&rsquo; mount from Best Buy&hellip; the Echogear is a MUST buy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted this to work, mostly because having to replace it with another brand means more holes in the wall. But after the TV was attached to the mount, per the instructions I made quite a bit of adjustment of the bottom end of the wallplate (it had to be moved about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; offset from the top, i.e. quite tilted from level) to level the TV. Not a heavy TV (40 lbs), so this seemed weird but it is related to there not being a way to lock down side to side tilt of the TV. You may not realize this until after you hang the TV because the instructions say to level the wallplate. But with the TV on it, every time I moved the position of the TV, the TV went way off-level.This happens because the flat hook that holds the bracket and TV to the wallplate and arm rests on a rounded surface with no way to lock the side-to-side level in place. You can see this in Step 6 in the installation instructions. The Allen screws supplied (screw [S] in the instructions) do not tighten enough to hold the TV level, so it easily goes off level any time you touch it. It can&rsquo;t be fixed by changing the level of the wallplate because it&rsquo;s the attachment point of the TV bracket to the articulating arm that causes the problem.Probably returning it to Amazon unless the company has a solution to the side-to-side rocking problem.Customer service is not great. Initiated request on a Saturday, they didn&rsquo;t reply until Tuesday. It was a holiday weekend but even so they say they are available 7 days/week. It&rsquo;s now Wednesday and the problem is still not resolved. Now they want me to call.INSTALLATION PROBLEMS: The bracket extenders were mislabeled &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;R&rdquo;. I believe they should actually say &ldquo;TOP&rdquo; and BOTTOM&rdquo;. Otherwise you have to screw the bottom ones on backwards and they won&rsquo;t seat properly. The instructions are also not clear about which side of the extenders should be screwed to the bracket.PROS:Nice that tools are not needed to adjust forward tilt and the whole mount seems solid despite the various problems. Even so will have to return it if there&rsquo;s no solution to the TV rocking problem.</p>
