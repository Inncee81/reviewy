<h5 id="works-well-with-two-caveats">Works well &ndash; with two caveats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very satisfied with this purchase. I have cleaned maybe 75 records already, most of which were bought secondhand and graded G+, VG or VG+. I would say easily half of those if not more were improved enough to move them one step upward on the grading scale. Pops and crackles are reduced, often significantly, and the records come out nice and shiny, too. The old Discwasher brush kits don’t even come close to this.I do feel the need to address two misconceptions about this item.The first has to do with the label getting wet. If you fill the washer correctly (up to the fill line), a label will never be spun into the water, so you don’t ever have to worry about that. On the other hand, sometimes as the record is spun, water can drip off the half of the record that’s not in the water, down onto the label. I can’t imagine that this would do much damage to a label, especially if the water is wiped off quickly. However, if there is writing on the label, any ink present could absolutely smudge if it gets wet by water dripping off the top half of the record. I found this out the hard way.Secondly, you will see that most of the dirt, dust and lint cleaned off of your records will indeed settle to the bottom of the washer. However, after several records washed, enough of this dirt will remain suspended in the solution that I’m not comfortable agreeing with the other reviewers who say that after several washings you’re not getting even a tiny amount of junk back onto your record. Having cleaned 75 or so records, I’ve replaced the water in the tank three times already because the water just looked like it was too dirty to continue using. Now, I am 100% convinced that any record I’ve cleaned ends up in much better condition after the cleaning, regardless of what’s getting back onto the disc, and I can’t imagine that a small amount of dirt that might get back onto the record would cause much damage. Then again, I’m not a hardcore audiophile, and if you are then perhaps this isn’t the right record cleaner for you - for this reason. Otherwise, trust your eye, dump the water and refill when you see that it’s time, and continue.Oh, and you’ll probably need to pick up additional cleaning cloths, especially for marathon cleaning sessions. The two cloths provided with the set work fine but they will become saturated after maybe ten records each, and past that point you’re basically just pushing water around on the disc.</p>

<h5 id="have-extra-drying-cloths-on-hand-before-starting-the-cleaning-process">Have extra drying cloths on hand before starting the cleaning process</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well, the most difficult part is drying the record after it&rsquo;s washed. Definitely have more than the two cloths included in the starter kit, and know that if you plan to use the included cloths, they highly recommend washing (no fabric softener) and drying prior to use. I used a clean, dry microfiber cleaning cloth, and found the most effective way was to use one cloth to get the bulk of the water off the vinyl, then use another cloth to remove the last bit of moisture. The first cloth gets soaked pretty fast. It worked well at getting sticky plastic residue (from poor quality original record sleeves) off the vinyl and I&rsquo;ve never seen the grooves shine quite that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what you think it is: a bathtub for your records. It&rsquo;s a simple idea, but very nicely executed. The cleaning pads fit well into their slots and create the right amount of friction against the record surface, and the rollers at each end make turning the record very easy. The manufacturer claims the items was hand-assembled in the USA. It shows. If you&rsquo;re serious about your records, I would urge you to combine the Spin-Clean with a vacuum-based record cleaning machine. There are many here on Amazon, such as the Record Doctor V and the Nitty Gritty, to name a couple. Some are completely manual, one side at a time, others are &hellip; little more elaborate. lol</p>

<h5 id="excellent-at-removing-dust-from-lps">Excellent at removing dust from LPs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Previously, I used a carbon fiber brush before playing every record, and I cleaned dirty records with a Discwasher brush. The Spin Clean has taken the place of the Discwasher.In my experience, the Spin Clean removes all visible dust and dirt and leaves the record surface looking clean. It also reduces static, even after you put the LP away and take it back out again. With very dusty LPs, I notice a nice reduction in noise. The Spin Clean doesn&rsquo;t remove anything really challenging - the kinds of things I&rsquo;ve successfully removed with a sponge and warm water - so you may want to clean those spots before Spin Cleaning the LP. I recommend the Spin Clean, if for no other reason than less dust should mean less record wear.Some have written that the Spin Clean is just a big cheap piece of plastic. As with any product, you are paying for the design and engineering, not just the materials. I&rsquo;m not able to mold plastic into the shape of a record cleaner, but for $80, Spin Clean can.Some tips: 1. I bought some microfiber towels to dry my records with when they come out of the Spin Clean. They are thicker and more absorbent than the Spin Clean drying towels. My records seem even quieter. I&rsquo;m guessing this is because all the water (with any contaminants) is drawn into the towels before it can air dry onto the record. Eurow Microfiber 16 x 16 in. 300 GSM Cleaning Towels 12-Pack (Green) 2. Also, when you fill the Spin Clean to just below the rollers, as instructed, the innermost grooves on some records don&rsquo;t get submerged in fluid (though they do get wiped by the brushes). I add enough water to reach the inner groove on most LPs (as well as a bit more cleaning fluid), and it hasn&rsquo;t created any problems during cleaning. I think the inner grooves get cleaner. 3. Though it seems possible for dirt to get onto the pads and scratch the records, it has never happened to me (I&rsquo;ve cleaned about 500 records). To be safe, I always clean my records with a carbon fiber brush before spin-cleaning them to remove excess dust.Spin Clean customer service is very good. I initially had an issue with the brushes on my unit, and I emailed customer service for advice but received only a brief response. I contacted them again, explaining the problem, and they apologized for the previous brief response, explaining that they hadn&rsquo;t had anyone with that issue before. They replaced my unit, which was above and beyond what I expected. A great product.Update Nov. 2012: I purchased a VPI 16.5 record cleaning machine. It does get the records audibly cleaner than the Spin-Clean (at 7.5 times the price), however, I still use the Spin-Clean, since I get a lot of LPs at the thrift store, and they&rsquo;re often very dirty. I give them all a good cleaning on the Spin-Clean first and use the VPI for cleaning the LPs I decide to keep.I can also confirm that the Spin-Clean does not scratch LPs, as I have had many LPs - all of which were cleaned first on the Spin-Clean - come out of the VPI machine almost completely free of surface noise. This couldn&rsquo;t happen if the Spin-Clean was scratching records.</p>
