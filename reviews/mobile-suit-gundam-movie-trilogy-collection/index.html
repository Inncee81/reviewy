<h5 id="more-than-a-pleasant-surprise">More than a pleasant surprise</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a surprise to find the original series of the Gundam&rsquo;s as I had thought never to see it, be it in its original form or other format, so finding the three movies it had become who could resist grabbing it while the grabbing was good? Politics, adventure and the odd romantic moment all rolled up into a grand adventure.I&rsquo;ll admit I had a ball picking amidst the movies and finding the forerunners of the Wing Seed and 00 Universes. And they are there, easy enough to find if you look and believe me, I looked and I enjoyed. If there is one thing the Gundam genre has kept continuity with its a decent story line with characters that have some depth to them. You get the shallower characters but then you get the gems and for me its usually the grey characters that I enjoy the most.If you watch a Gundam series you should expect to see more than giant mecha running around shooting each other&hellip; and I for one am damn glad it is so much more than that.The movies are long, incorporating so much of the original series that I have to wonder what they might have left out. You think movie and you think editing and missing half the series, but in this case, I don&rsquo;t think so. Its detailed, complex and more than just enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-classic-need-i-say-more">The CLASSIC! Need I say more?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The original Trilogy! The one that spawned every adaptation of the saga, and now it&rsquo;s a hard to find item. Granted, 100 years from now, very few people will even be able to recall anything from the original trilogy, but either way, it&rsquo;s a classic and one I will cherish. I just hope my kids or their kids don&rsquo;t decide to try to sell it after I&rsquo;m gone. Either way, if you are looking for this series, gear up; it&rsquo;s getting extremely hard to locate these days. Good artbox, all discs in great condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, to start this review I&rsquo;m going to be honest, I purchased this not realizing I was only getting the 3 TV movies. I thought it was the entire series.Pros:For what its worth&hellip; This is a good buy. If you hate how gundam series involve alot of politics, buy this, it skips the jibber jabber and cuts to the heart of the story, and more importantly, the action. I watched all 3 movies on a 42&rdquo; plasma tv, the resolution is crisp and the audio is perfect, even when im annoying my neighbors with the high volume! (Watch all your gundam series LOUD trust me its awesome.)Cons:I do not like the shortened format. I&rsquo;m a fan of the full length version as ive watched it at a friend&rsquo;s house. Im also VERY critical of this version because they cut out the Amuro and Gundam&rsquo;s battle with M&rsquo;Quve and the Gyan in New Texas colony. They focus more on Amuro VS Char, and cut out alot of the sequences of shooting down multiple Zaku&rsquo;s and blah blah blah.Regardless of all the cuts, The series still makes sense. If you&rsquo;ve never seen Mobile Suit Gundam, at least you&rsquo;ll get the summary of it. them leaving out the M&rsquo;Quve fight really burns me, the Gyan is a super cool Zeon unit.Verdict: I&rsquo;d buy it again, but i wish i&rsquo;d found the complete series first.. the complete series is now in my wishlist.. its about $150.00 and has a glorious load of extras from the original run. Either way they will both soon take up a place on my shelf for my sons to someday enjoy.</p>

<h5 id="ms-gundam-gets-the-5-star-treatment-from-bandai">MS Gundam gets the 5 star treatment from Bandai!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this to get a domestic US release ever since I first heard about the Japanese re-issues almost 2 years ago. It&rsquo;s been worth the wait.I&rsquo;ve seen these movies multiple times in mutliple formats over the years (I first saw these in 1985, dubbed on video, with no subtitles ^o^)&hellip;I have never seen them look this good. The picture is sharp, the color is rich and there isn&rsquo;t a hint of artifacting/glitching present.The audio has been completely remastered and re-recorded! The weapons, explosions and effects are completely redone for this version and it sounds fantastic. There are both a Dolby 5.1 and Stereo audio tracks (both in Japanese, there is no English dub present) accompanied by well done and detailed subtitling&hellip;nothing is omitted&hellip;(even bkg speaking is included!)The story is quintessential space opera. A war rages between the people of Earth and their colonies&hellip;but it&rsquo;s not a clear case of good guys and bad guys. Everything is not what it seems, intrigue and betrayal colors every event and the human drama serves as a vehicle for some amazing robot battles (rather than toy sales as is more common today).I cannot endorse a classic piece of animation released in the US more strongly. Bandai has done a fanstastic job bringing these movies to the US and if you&rsquo;ve only seen the new Gundamn material&hellip;watch this and see where it all began. Among the top 5 anime ever produced&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stuff">Great stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really enjoy the condensed movie trilogy of the classic Gundam series. It&rsquo;s definitely a give and take as the changes made from the TV series go though (the core booster is so much better than the G Armor but the omission of the Gyan fight in Texas colony is just mean).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="condensed-gundam">Condensed Gundam!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Following RightStuf&rsquo;s release of Mobile Suit Gundam on Bluray and DVD, we also get the Mobile Suit Gundam movies. Collecting Mobile Suit Gundam I, Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow, and Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space, these 3 discs cover the three theatrical Gundam releases. Each movie is a condensed version of the show. For example, the first movie covers the attack on Amuro&rsquo;s colony up until Operation Odessa. The second covering from there up to the return to space after the Jaburo assault; and so on. The movie&rsquo;s hold up a lot better than the actual show due to the improved visuals. There is new footage added but it was only shortly after the TV show had come out so its not as jarring a difference as the Zeta Gundam movies new footage was.Otherwise, this is an excellent release. It is subbed only like the previous Bandai release and only available on DVD but to have it rereleased is awesome!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-video-audio-transfer">Good video &amp; audio transfer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Classic Gundam in an accessible form (quicker watch than a 43 episode series, but covers the story well). Good video &amp; audio transfer, considering the age of the source.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-too-bad">Not too bad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very barebones release of the classic compilation movie trilogy. Each movie is made from footage as well as newly animated footage, with the third film having 70% new footage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-content-of-the-movies-themselves-are-pretty-good-and-i-can-see-why-this-has-been">The content of the movies themselves are pretty good and I can see why this has been &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The content of the movies themselves are pretty good and I can see why this has been such a popular series. <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> discs arrived scratched though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-rushing-through-gundam-not-much-else">Good for rushing through Gundam, not much else.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wanting to get a start in the Mobile Suit Gundam Franchise, I highly recommend watching the English dubbed series, as opposed to these films.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-does-not-have-the-original-theatrical-audio-it">This does not have the original theatrical audio. It &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This does not have the original theatrical audio. It only has the modern 5.1 Japanese remix audio which means no vocal tracks and no classic Gundam sound effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-a-really-good-set-though-if-you-re-into-gundam">Its a really good set though if you&rsquo;re into Gundam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not what I expected as I expected to at least have gotten Chars Counterattack.. Its a really good set though if you&rsquo;re into Gundam..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came as described</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-release">A great release!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The video quality is fine, what you would expect of a standard DVD release. However, there is a new remixed 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-says-it-says-that-there-is-a-dubbed-option">it says it says that there is a dubbed option &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it says it says that there is a dubbed option. There isn&rsquo;t. Only subbed in English. Im honestly thinking of returning it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This very cool thanks</p>
