<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="poor-clip-great-speed-small-battery-life">Poor clip. Great speed. Small battery life.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan would have received 5 stars if the clip was better. It just is too &ldquo;tight&rdquo; and not very wide and doesn&rsquo;t clip to any part of the stroller that would make using it convenient. Horrible clip. I have to clip it to the fabric of the hood of the stroller and angle it down on the baby. That&rsquo;s the only place it works. The speed is great though. Very powerful. Died after about an hour and a half of continuous use. It&rsquo;s nice you can recharge it with the same cord as my galaxy! You get in fan speed what you lose out in on clipping ability. To be honest though I&rsquo;d probably buy a fan that is less powerful but clips appropriately. This is unable to be used like I&rsquo;d like it to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-fan">Great little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely love this fan! I bought 2 of these for my kids double stroller. The clip is plenty strong to handle all the bumps the stroller hits. The fan does a great job at keeping the kids cool. We typically run it around the medium setting and get about 2-3 hours of use on 1 charge. My 1 complaint is that you can&rsquo;t use the fan while charging, so you can&rsquo;t add a lipstick charger to make it last longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-cooling-down-the-little-ones">Perfect for cooling down the little ones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased to use as a stroller fan for my infant on hot summer days during walks in the park, or to blow on her while she is in the carseat. Her seat is still rear-facing &amp; it takes awhile for the air to circulate to her. This will push the air towards her to keep her cool during the hot days. Since it is USB chargeable. I can use my portable battery pack that I would use for my phone to charge it up to keep the fan working for her.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-spin-class">Great for Spin Class</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great fan. I bought it to use in spin class and it works perfectly! It lasts for about 2-2.5 hours. Not sure if it loses charge when its just sitting. I used it for spin class on 2 different days without charging and it stopped in the middle of the 2nd class. The classes were about 3 days apart. So as long as I charge it before the class it&rsquo;s good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-mini-fan">Awesome mini fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this fan! We purchased it for our infant in these summer months and it&rsquo;s been a lifesaver when there is no a/c. The fan is great and strong but my favorite is the water mist that feels like a cooler. Definitely a great purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-fan-1">great little fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this little fan! We have a 3 month old and we took her to the beach. This little fan worked great! We clipped it onto our beach chair under our umbrella and it kept her cool and happy! She stayed out longer because she was cool and shaded! We also use it on her stroller while shopping. It has helped in several different situations. Highly recommend! We kept it on full power and it lasts a little over 2 hours straight. This is a must if you have a little one who will be outside in the summertime!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="literally-broke-the-first-time-i-tried-to-turn-it">Literally broke the first time I tried to turn it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Literally broke the first time I tried to turn it on. At first I thought it just needed to be charged, but even after charging it it still did not work. The motor would be running but the fan blades would just shake as if they were stuck. Tried multiple times to fix it and it would work for 2-3mins and then back to stuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-customer-service-as-they-did-replace-the-first-fan">Great customer service as they did replace the first fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update:Received a new fan&hellip; battery life still not what is claimed, I just carry a USB charging port with when I use the fan. Great customer service as they did replace the first fan.After having this fan For 3 months I to re-review the product.. When I first received it I charged the batteries (I also ordered replacement batteries) worked great. Then I recharged the batteries took it out. It quit working would work for 3 minutes turn off then in order to get it to work another 3 minutes I had to take battery out and put back in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke after a couple months of use</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wife-likes-this">Wife likes this.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wife likes this and that&rsquo;s all it needed to have high score. I only wonder why is batter not AA?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-fan">Good fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good fan but the charge doesn&rsquo;t last too long. Maybe an hour. It has a lot of power when the fan is turned up to high. I would buy this again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unfortunately-we-had-to-return-this-product-i-m">Unfortunately, we had to return this product. I&rsquo;m &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we had to return this product. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was defective, but the unit would not charge and would only work while plugged in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-plastic-blades-go-round-and-round-was-so-annoying-it-was-almost-comical">&hellip; the plastic blades go round and round was so annoying, it was almost comical</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The flapping sound made by this fan as the plastic blades go round and round was so annoying, it was almost comical. The enclosed rechargeable battery doesn&rsquo;t appear to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="has-only-one-air-flow-speed">Has only one air flow speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The minimum and maximum air flow is the same. The fan only has one speed even if turned up to max.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>comes in handy when you live in Florida!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-carseats">perfect for carseats.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality. Got for my kids&rsquo; carseats in the hot car. sturdy and powerful. A good buy. Wish the battery lasted longer but it lasts decently long.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this">Love this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this!! I clip it to my stroller and my baby carrier during hit days. The air feels cool, battery doesn&rsquo;t last outrageously long but true to description listed by seller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-fan">Love this fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this fan! Doesn&rsquo;t last a long time on battery but saved us on a long hot car trip!</p>
