<h5 id="the-pros-cons-and-oks-for-samsung-s-un40mu7000-hr">The Pros, Cons and Oks for Samsung&rsquo;s UN40MU7000 (HR).</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:_______<strong><em>- What you expect in a Samsung design: slick, clean, and light.- I do like the titan sliver Y stands as they do provide a decent amount of stability if you’re not going to put it on the wall.- The color balance is extremely accurate when launching it up for the first time. I didn’t feel that I had to change the layout.- Saturated reds, blues, greens are well in their levels and no matter how high the brightness level I make it these primary color still perform beautifully.- No neutral pixels you’re going to find on this screen. By connecting my laptop to show off HD screensavers, this TV brought the incredible color detail of each one (an array of colors).- Yes, 4K is shown in all its glory when you get this.- Samsung Smarthub layout is pretty easy to master as connecting your Netflix account and even internet browsing is pretty simple to do (I still prefer google chrome since my phone will always be near me).- HDR is indeed a great experience to see when the lights are turned down. My HDR experience from Amazon as it’s currently one of the few that can give you the option to see its show under the HDR experience.- Found it really cool when I turn on my PS4 it immediately switches the display layout to its game mode without me even lifting the remote.- Playing GTA 5 I didn’t see any lag that’s enough to make a notice about (Beautiful experience when driving a car in GTA.).- All you need is to download Miracast on your computer and that’s it. I was able to connect to it right away.- Oneremote controller buttons have a nice push and they don&rsquo;t have any discomforts as you can everything you need if you don’t have your phone, laptop, or your gaming counsel around.- It&rsquo;s future proof, this is not a 4 year and be done with it. You will be good for a while.Cons and Oks:</em></strong>____<strong><em>- There are hardware glitches upon digging deeper into the system. Scrolling with the remote does have some notice lag as well as sometimes I have to press an option twice to get a layout to open. I would assume future updates will fix this issue.- A decent amount of input layouts to get where you need to go. It’s a learning curve as it’s something you’re not going to learn in a day.- Playing HDR content the brightness isn’t the best around. It’s not bright at all and it’s something to take note if you’re planning to put this in an open floor panel.- The viewing angles are not good as I notice that the picture quality depletes if you move, from the center to the left and right of the screen. I would think after 6 feet away from the center you’re going to see a loss in quality (It&rsquo;s really not the much, but something you should know.)- Pretty expensive given what the market is offering for the same in software quality.- The brightness issue throughout the television is something to note, this is not only HDR.- The black levels are good but I’m sorry, OLED TVs excel in this area.- The remote itself can’t always be reliable as I recommend you use your phone for most of the interaction.Bottom Line:</em></strong>_______Samsung has provided a great design and picture quality for this and it’s indeed future proof. The color content is spot on and integrated smart TV with 4k is a bundle of joy. Put it on the wall and it’ll look like a picture while the HDR experience will prepare you for the future of viewing.There are some hiccups that need to be addressed with this design as HDR isn’t much on the market yet and shouldn’t be a must have feature right now (will be in the future). Software glitches and brightness issues are something to take note when buying this layout. You will have lag sometimes when using the remote as I try to get the most of my experience with the phone. Not only that but you will find cheaper TV’s with the same layout that this one has.Overall these cons are really not significant to change your mind as the main question you need to ask is whether you prefer OLED instead. As a Samsung user for many years, each TV made by them will hold its ground well beyond the expected breaking point. They put great care into making their TV’s and is why the brand is one reason you need to take into account before you buy. Verdict: A beautiful TV with an indecent price layout, given what the market is spitting out.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer</p>

<h5 id="this-tv-is-amazing-the-colors-and-brightness-are-superb">This TV is amazing. The colors and brightness are superb</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This TV is amazing. The colors and brightness are superb. I use it with my Ps4 Pro and my Pc at full 4K HDR. The text are sharp and colors are perfect. The sounds is&hellip; well I don&rsquo;t expect much from stock speakers on a TV this thin. It does have optical out but not analogue out, so keep that in mind to make sure it&rsquo;s compatible with your sound bar.This is pricey but for what you get really your only option in the TV space right now is the Sony 800, which is around the same price depending on where you get it. However, if you see them side by like the local store had them on display, there really is no comparison. The Sony is nice on it&rsquo;s own but cannot match the brightness and style of this Samsung.As a monitor it is really nice, it is only 60Hz, so you professional gamers may not be satisfied, but for us mere mortals this is great. I really couldn&rsquo;t tell the input lag difference from my monitor.</p>

<h5 id="thumbs-up-with-some-tips">Thumbs Up with Some Tips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying this set. I got the 65&rdquo; size, which fits our home theater nicely. The room is not a lot wider than the screen, so off-angle viewing isn&rsquo;t a problem.When it was first set up the installers tweaked the &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; video setting a bit, and I found the picture oversaturated to the point of garishness. I tested it with my Oppo play using Blu-Ray DVDs of Planet Earth I and Comcast DVR-recorded Planet Earth II. After resetting the video to &ldquo;Movie&rdquo; everything looked much better. I&rsquo;ve looked at a wide variety of sources and been generally quite pleased—a big step up from my old Sony HD TV, particularly in dynamic range (range of lights to darks). Because of this and its larger size, it puts out enough extra light that my wife can see to study her knitting while we watch in the darkened viewing room.I haven&rsquo;t been able to try the ultra HD features because like most people I don&rsquo;t have access yet to true Ultra sources. I got a Roku Ultra box that can stream 4K material, but because there is a long cable run between my equipment rack and the TV I will need a booster balun. The baluns now available, like the AV Access HDMI Extender, deal with 4K resolution, but not with the widened color gamut and dynamic range of full Ultra HD.My installer says there is one in the works that should be released later this year, and I&rsquo;ll have that installed when it&rsquo;s available which I&rsquo;ll be using to boost the signal fed through my current Cat 5 cable.Meanwhile my Oppo DVD player can&rsquo;t handle 4K, so there&rsquo;s no point in purchasing 4K discs until I get a new player. Netflix doesn&rsquo;t rent out Ultra 4K discs. Sooner or later Ultra 4K sources will be more widely available, but right now your best bet is streaming via the Internet. But for that you need a fast connection, or you may experience glitches.So the moral is, you&rsquo;re investing in the future when you buy this set. You won&rsquo;t necessarily be able to turn it on and view it at its full capability. But even as a standard HDTV, it&rsquo;s a beauty, and reasonably priced from Amazon, which didn&rsquo;t charge anything to me as a Prime customer to ship it and have it taken into the viewing room and unboxed. I didn&rsquo;t pay Amazon for installation because it had to be integrated with my other equipment and my universal remote, so that cost me another $430. There was also no sales tax charged, which may depend on which state you&rsquo;re in (I&rsquo;m in Washington State).</p>
