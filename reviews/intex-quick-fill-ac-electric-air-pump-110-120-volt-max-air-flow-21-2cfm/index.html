<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-fast">Easy to use &amp; Fast</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this pump to inflate our pool floats during the summer. It&rsquo;s small and compact, but it fills the floats fast. The pump includes a few nozzle sizes for different plugs. The deflate feature also comes in handy at the end of the pool season. The floats deflated almost as fast as they inflated. I&rsquo;m happy with this pump and would definitely recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-what-it-is-supposed-to-works-pretty-well-for-a-small-pump-at-a-reasonable-price">Does what it is supposed to; works pretty well for a small pump at a reasonable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The advertised pump is an Intex pump which I purchased to inflate a fairly large Intex pool (see pictures). I received a similar pump by Coleman. Although it is not the same as the picture, they are essentially the same type of product, a small electric pump, and I cannot comment on whether one brand is better than the other.I found the pump to be effective for blowing up my pool. It comes with 3 different attachments: a large round one, a medium sized with pointed tip, and a smaller one with pointed tip. The pool I was blowing up also had 3 different sized valves for various parts of the pool. The main part was wide and open, about 1 inch+ across and the other 2 sizes were small like you would find on normal sized floats and a slightly bigger one like you would find on larger sized floats. The attachments fit perfectly in the largest hole and the bigger valve, however, there was not a good fit for the smaller valve. I was able to make it work, but in the future I will be purchasing a smaller attachment for more efficient and better results.It also took a very long time to inflate. I expected it to take some time considering it is a small pump, but it took much longer than I thought it would. If you have a large inflatable and do not have patience, you may want to look for a more powerful pump.Overall, it does what it is supposed to do and works pretty well for a small pump at a reasonable price.</p>

<h5 id="stop-sending-yourself-into-lightheadedness-just-trying-to-blow-up-a-boat-or-an-air-mattress-for-some-summer-fun-i-was-patently">Stop sending yourself into lightheadedness just trying to blow up a boat or an air mattress for some summer fun. I was patently</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Buy one of these if you own any sort of inflatable product that you use more than once a year. No more do you need to exhaust your knees or employ your children&rsquo;s labour to assist in inflating the pool over several hours. Stop sending yourself into lightheadedness just trying to blow up a boat or an air mattress for some summer fun. I was patently ashamed to see how quick and easy this Intex pump did it.The most difficult part might be finding an extension cord, and since the pump uses a two-pronged attachment, it plugs into nearly everything and anything. Cord length might be the only drawback. The main work is selecting the right size of attachment for the inflation nib, then stick this in and hold in place. With a whirl of fans, the pump does the rest.Give a rest to this little guy between sections if you are blowing up something like a large pool because the engine and fans can run rather hot. I didn&rsquo;t want to burn out the pump by overuse. A few minutes on a table are usually sufficient to get back to work, and in the meantime, you can have a nice drink or move everything around the bedroom.Without fail, I pack our pump whenever we go camping or travelling with any sort of inflatable pool toys, dinghies, or whatever have you. It&rsquo;s been a favourite, and especially appreciated by elderly relatives who don&rsquo;t have the lungs to handle a queen air mattress.</p>

<h5 id="quick-handy-inflater">Quick, handy inflater</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought and used this handy pump recently to inflate a sofa/bed item. It inflated the sofa which is in 3 sections, very quickly! Only took about 7 minutes to inflate! I was impressed! It&rsquo;s a bit loud but I don&rsquo;t think there are any quiet air pumps and it does the job fast so not a big deal. Haven&rsquo;t figured out how to use it to deflate though. There are no specific instructions regarding that. The top part of the pump is the &ldquo;deflater&rdquo; but try as I might with that and nozzle, the sofa would not deflate. The first time deflating I ended up just using the nozzle part in the valve of the sofa without turning on the pump! The second time my hubby found out the thing can be deflated simply by unscrewing the valve - the air comes out &ldquo;by itself&rdquo;! Who knew? LOL So, anyway, I recommend because it&rsquo;s really handy and I like it doesn&rsquo;t need batteries like our previous one!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it to rep lace the burned out pump in my inflatable bed. I felt this was the correct choice. I didn&rsquo;t check it right away so I can&rsquo;t return it as it in no way would have worked. It was also missing the nozzles. I don&rsquo;t feel necessarily that it was the vendors fault, except for the missing parts, but when someone is looking to replace an internal pump on a bed, descriptions could be better. So I tossed the bed rather than spend more time and money to find the right part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-slow-for-kiddie-wading-pool">Very Slow for Kiddie Wading Pool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t understand all the super-positive reviews on this pump! I bought a small wading pool for my 12 month old grandson. It&rsquo;s the 48 x 10 Inflatable Starts Kiddie 2-Ring Pool. It took almost 15 minutes to inflate this little pool. My plan was to inflate and deflate the pool after every weekly visit from my grandson but the inflation process is just too lengthy and I don&rsquo;t have the patience is sit by the pump and hold the nozzle in place for 15 minutes a shot. In addition, the pump is fairly noisy and annoying. I haven&rsquo;t yet deflated the pool but that process could be even longer.I returned this pump and purchased the Airhead AHP-120 Air Pump 120 Volts. It&rsquo;s far superior for only two dollars more. See my review on that pump for details.</p>

<h5 id="quick-to-air-up-and-excellent-to-deflate-mattresses-as-well-for-storage">Quick to air up and excellent to deflate mattresses as well for storage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought as a replacement pump for our air mattresses. Works exactly as intended. Quick to air up and excellent to deflate mattresses as well for storage. We use for camping every summer or when family needs a place to crash for a night when passing through. I have even started using this pump for pool floats &amp; tubes for the summer, love that it can deflate them for easy storage (other wise the floats would probably get holes or in the way &amp; end up being tossed out)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-air-pump">Nice little air pump</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived in perfect condition and easily inflated our pool toys. Like the fact that this pump can be used to deflate our floaties when not needed to keep clutter down on our patio.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-good">not good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>does not work good at all and would not recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-use-it-for-everything-inflatable">I use it for everything inflatable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for everything inflatable. I have used this for my pool, several mattresses, inflatable toys and water floaters, etc&hellip; I love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>

<h5 id="great-equipment">Great equipment.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quickly fills inflatables. Must have.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-help">Great Help</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pump was a life saver. Me nor my husband have the capacity to blow up the toys. This was fast and easy to use. It also takes the air out so you can store the toys.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast and simple to use great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Great item and come with three different size of adapters</p>

<h5 id="why-didn-t-we-do-this-sooner">Why didn&rsquo;t we do this sooner?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were spending a small fortune on batteries for our original Intex air pump. This plug-in version makes a BIG difference with our time and money spent. Well worth the money!!</p>
