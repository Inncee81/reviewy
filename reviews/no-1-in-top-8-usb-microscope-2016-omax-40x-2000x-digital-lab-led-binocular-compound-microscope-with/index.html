<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-investment">Great Investment!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a superbly built microscope! Comes easy to setup and has many great features. I have not had a chance to use the immersion oil lens yet, but every other objective lens has worked perfectly. I easily lose track of time while observing different slides under this microscope. The built in camera is a really nice feature; It makes it really simple to make cool videos to edit and post online. Overall, I could not be any happier with this microscope.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-can-t-stop-thinking-about-microorganisms">I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about microorganisms!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great microscope! The 20x viewer paired with the 40x scope is phenominal. And it still goes up to 100x. The things I have seen so far are just amazing. I strictly use this for hobby, not research or work related, so my review is more towards hobby. The build quality is solid, this thing is well structured. The focus ring and directional rings are very smooth and precise to use. The light adjustment is also great to work with. Slides dont pinch down but on its sides so easy to put a slide in and out. The camera quality connecting to a pc is only like 1280 × 1160 or something, but when setting pc monitor, inhave a 4k to that resolution, it works well and is quite clear for that resolution. Not great, but clear to see whats going on. For the price if you are going to use the pc connector, go for it. But looking through the eyepiece is better obviously. If you really want the pc view opt for the 500 dollar or so one with higher resolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-scope">Great scope.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for an 8 year old and by evening on Christmas he was able to use it himself. He has never hooked it up to a computer, and just has it in his room, but it is fine for looking at all kinds of pre-made slides and things he finds. He has not used the oil immersion, but that&rsquo;s ok since it can build up on the scope and &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; your viewing if you don&rsquo;t clean the oil off properly. He&rsquo;s a little young to understand what he&rsquo;s seeing if it&rsquo;s really tiny (bacteria) using oil anyway. This microscope is very good quality - vastly better than the toy microscopes we had as kids. Note that the slides have sharp edges, and of course they are glass, so don&rsquo;t give one of these to a kid who is careless and rough with it. It is a scientific instrument, but simple enough for a careful kid to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-microscope-and-bargain">Great Microscope and Bargain!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This microscope is well worth the money. It worked perfectly within minutes of opening the box! The enclosed CD makes interfacing the microscope to the computer a breeze. It&rsquo;s cool to look at a video display of the microscope image on the computer screen. You may find another one to be as good, but any other couldn&rsquo;t be better.My primary concern was the mechanics of the stage movement(s). All axes were good, as well as the quality optics. We bought it for my grandson, a student in Chemistry/Biology at Appalachian State University, and he has really enjoyed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-especially-for-the-price">Love it, especially for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Still fiddling with it, but for the price I don&rsquo;t know if you could beat this microscope. My biology teacher says you can&rsquo;t get a good microscope for under a thousand dollars, but I think I will bring this one in just to show her the quality of the images I&rsquo;m getting. I was cautious about the quality, but I&rsquo;m really impressed with it. I might come back later with pictures of slides, I&rsquo;m still exploring the monitor functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-is-it-a-zeiss-or-olympus">awesome. Is it a Zeiss or Olympus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, awesome. Is it a Zeiss or Olympus? No. But you can see as well on well prepared slides as you can on the more expensive instruments. I have been using microscopes for 50 years, but didn&rsquo;t have one recently so went for this. Software for the cam worked well, even though my computer runs XP. Professional quality seeing at a baggain price. Only complaint is that there is some wobble but when slight push on the stage, but againn this scope is not as massive as ones costing 10X more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-microscope">Love this microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with this Omax microscope. Many features found only much more expensive scopes. The software for stills or video worked well, 1st time, without any study or hassle. The optics are clear, the binocular adjustments easy, eye relief and exit pupil were good. I like the LED light for the magnifications I use (100, 400x). A high end microscope for little more $ than the bargain &lsquo;scopes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellenet-value-and-performance">Excellenet value and performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not going to be the best Microscope you can buy but quite likely could be the best for the price you will pay. The quality of this Microscope is great and construction seems very well built. You might want to purchase a case for it but everything you need comes with the microscope. The only drawback was that the manual disk/cd would not work on my MacBook Pro and the URL link provided with the microscope was in error but an email to the vendor was quickly answered with a valid copy of the manual. What more could you ask for?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product seems good, I just am not a good user of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="optics-and-mechanics-are-flawless">Optics and mechanics are flawless</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well-engineered both mechanically and optically. Absolutely no slop in the gears. The computer interface with my computer was seamless.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="feels-and-operates-like-a-high-end-microscope">Feels and operates like a high-end microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exceeded my expectations for the cost. It reminds me of the ones I used in college, but those didn&rsquo;t have a USB camera which is a definite plus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-absolutely-no-experience-using-a-microscope">I have absolutely no experience using a Microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have absolutely no experience using a Microscope, but I will say this, I took it out of the box, set it up and was looking at my dogs hair in a matter of minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this on sale&hellip; and it has exceeded my expectations. I primarily use it for checking the bacteria in my fermentation projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="link-to-driver-and-manual-out-of-date-provide">Link to driver and manual out of date. Provide &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Link to driver and manual out of date. Provide CD, but what computer comes with a CD ROM anymore. Update the link to the driver or camera unsable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-microscope-for-the-price">Nice microscope for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to start by saying this is a good microscope for the price. The optics are fairly decent for non plan objectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-our-homeschooling-family">Perfect for our homeschooling family!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We got this microscope for using with my son&rsquo;s HomeSchool curriculum. The idea was to purchase one that would be reliable for a few years. He loves Science.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-ptoduct">Great ptoduct</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, easy to set up, easy to use, does exactly what was needed</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-bought-this-as-a-gift-for-my-4th-year">I bought this as a gift for my 4th year &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a gift for my 4th year pharmaceutical student. He gives it rave reviews. He should know.</p>
