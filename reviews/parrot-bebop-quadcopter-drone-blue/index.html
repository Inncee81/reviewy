<h5 id="i-want-to-love-the-parot-bebop-drone-but-it-just-won-t-let-me">I want to love the Parot Bebop Drone but it just won&rsquo;t let me&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the drone only - no controller.It took me a few days to learn how to fly it with an iPhone/iPad because the box came with NO INSTRUCTIONS.Getting started&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-My first flight, which was indoors, consisted of it hovering for a few seconds and then it blasted straight up in the air so fast that when it hit the ceiling I thought it would come down in 20 pieces, but no only 2 ( the wireless panel on the back leg flew off). This happened to me two times, so I went outside.Flying outside ended in several crashes because i could not steer it at all so it just floated into trees. Just when I conceded to pack it up and send it back, I got an email from the Parrot Drone Acadamy (after I registered it) and the email had 3 short tutorials on Youtube - THESE ARE CRITICAL to using the drone. I wish my box had a note in it that said watch the videos first!Learning to Fly&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;After watching the pilot video I tried one more time to fly it and&hellip; Voila I had my first awesome successful flight after try #7. I now am thinking &ldquo;ok, this thing does work, it&rsquo;s pretty cool&rdquo;. After spending a day with some decent flights under my belt I got more daring and tried to see how high I can go&ndash; BIG MISTAKE!Just when you think you got it&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Bebop loses wifi connection REGULARLY!!! Instead of hovering like it should, it starts to drift, and drift, faster and faster as it just FLIES AWAY!!! So now I&rsquo;m running after it across the street and through the corn fields. As I&rsquo;m running, I&rsquo;m trying to go back into my wireless settings on my phone and reconnect to it - then go back in the FreeFlight app and try to gain control as it says &ldquo;impossible to connect&rdquo; over and over, all while running as fast as I can and looking up at the sky every now and then to see where its going&hellip; phew I&rsquo;m tired. Maybe the Bebop is just a diet-plan in disguise?? Iv&rsquo;e been running for about 300ft and I see it heading for large trees. I think this is it, the final flight. Just then, it stops and hovers about 30ft up and my phone connects! I quickly tap &ldquo;Landing&rdquo; and it comes down safely.This is just the first five days. Sigh.Conclusion&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- The Bebop has a good design and the App to control it is very cool - if it worked 100% it would be really cool.- The onboard camera is just ok. The claim of 14mp and HD video is a serious stretch. My Nikon is 12mp and looks WAY better than this 14mp camera - hell my iPhone is better quality and its lower resolution.- If you use a phone/pad to control it DO not let it go very far from you and it will work as it should.- Stay low most of the time.- YOU CAN NOT TRUST IT so stay away from trees and water.- The battery connector is a joke, its a floppy wire that has a little string on it and you have to try and marry the two up, it&rsquo;s the strangest thing I have ever seen.- It is definitely strong, after many crashes it still works.</p>

<h5 id="parrot-bebop-drone-arrived-11-dec-2015">Parrot Bebop Drone - Arrived 11-DEC-2015</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been interested in expanding my photography business into a commercial market by offering aerial photography as a service. Have been flying small unmanned aerial vehicles - for fun - for some time. This has proven to be a value added prerequisite for the aerial photography business I have in mind. Aerial photography has taken leaps and bounds in capability since the advent of advance drone technology. However, drones with imaging systems I looked at had low-resolution cameras attached to the drone bottom; with low quality images - and unstable captures produced in flight with lower end models. While those drones with higher resolution cameras (that would actually meet my need) had - not cheap - cameras attached with a stabilizing gimbal - and cost several thousands of dollars.Common sense dictated to me that a drone costing several thousands of dollars that could potentially crash and burn on a maiden voyage would not make me (or my wife) happy. I come across the Parrot Bebop quadcopter drone recently. This photography tool is actually designed as a flying camera (installed is a 14 Megapixel f/2.4 1080p HD 3-axis stabilized camera) - for just a few hundred dollars. Algorithms developed by engineers provides a 3-axis image stabilization system that maintains a fixed angle of the view regardless of the inclination of the drone or movement caused by wind turbulence.As a side note: I notice online several people that purchased the Bebop complaining that ‘this thing doesn’t work”. However – this drone is not a toy. The device analyzes data from numerous 3-axis sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, an ultrasound sensor with a 26 ½ foot reach, a pressure sensor and a vertical camera to measure speed. I would assume that most of these ‘complainers’ about the Bebop drone took the device out of the box – charged the battery - pushed the ‘takeoff’ button and expected the drone to fly itself. The way I approached this task is by viewing as much information as I could about the drone (especially pre-flight setup) – and then took baby steps to get my head wrapped around how to pilot the drone in flight. Perhaps rather than saying the Bebop drone is ‘crap’ these people were experiencing operator errors as opposed to equipment failures - you think?I did learn how to get the Bebop off the ground and land safely after it arrived at our home on Friday night. On Saturday morning I went outdoors to fly the drone from my backyard (see link below). This was the piloting process for me. I was cautious with the first flight - Setting the maximum hight and distance the drone could travel from me at 30 meters (about 99 feet). On the second flight I set the maximum hight and distance distance at 40 meters (about 131 feet) - and on this final flight in the linked video, I set the maximum hight and distance at 50 meters (about 164 feet) I did experience a drop in the wifi signal at 164 feet distance and about 100 feet in the air for several seconds - but my drone just hovered until it reconnected and I was able to continue the fight and bring it back to where I launched (most excellent!).I am impressed by how well this drone is designed, durable and has seamless functionality wirelessly with my iPad Air.[&hellip;]The Davenport Projex</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun product and fairly robust. I have crashed it a number of times and it still works. One of the batteries was DOA and tech support would replace it but it was to much of a hassle and I gave up. I use a tablet to control mine and it works okay. Dose take forever to connect. I would suggest that you read the online info and make sure you set up flight parameters before you take your first flight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first turned it on and hit the takeoff button on my phone, it automatically flipped over. What I read online was to switch the prop positions. The black props are in front and the red ones are in back. Problem solved.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this drone. It is my first drone but I am very happy, it has everything I expected, great stability, easy to use especially if you are a beginner, shoot and take photos in high resolution, have GPS and other features that make it a good product for its price .Cons: The camera does not record well in low light. The drone comes with two batteries but it came to me with a damaged one when I called the tech support they said it was a common problem. Each battery provides a flight time of between 10 and 15 minutes only.</p>

<h5 id="i-think-no-other-drone-competes-at-this-price-range">I think no other drone competes at this price range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A fast and big drone with a great camera, it is not as big as the phantom which makes it great for travel, using it by an app on my phone which is great because i hate battery controllers, has good range and the video is nice, pretty stable, the wide angle lens helps to look down but if you prefer there is &ldquo;ace&rdquo; mode in the app which allows you to control where the camera looks, if you crash this one it seems pretty easy to fix by yourself</p>

<p>I bought the drone only late last year. It is my first drone. Out of the box, it would not even turn on. I also learned it did not have a controller.</p>
