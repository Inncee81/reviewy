<h5 id="super-product-and-package">Super product and package!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy with my Pocket Radar Ball Coach. It provides extremely consistent readings. Now, I have not yet been able to compare its performance against one of the extremely expensive radar guns, so I cannot comment on the accuracy. However, I did have a chance to compare it against a $100 Bushnell model and it was not even close. Whereas the Pocket Radar Ball Coach was consistent pitch after pitch&hellip;.that is to say if a pitcher was throwing his fastball and the speed showed as 84, the next fastball showed maybe 83 or 85, but never more that a couple of mph different from the previous pitch.The Bushnell, on the other hand, was all over the place. The only thing consistent about it was that it was consistently low. While the PRBC was showing, say, 82, 82, 83, 84, 84 on five consecutive fastballs, the Bushnell read 71, 63, 75, 44, and 58. Completely unreliable. After a few pitches, the coach threw the Bushnell down and relied on my readings for the rest of the tryouts.As to the price, this package is a phenomenal bargain. For essentially the same price as the PRBC alone, you get all these extra goodies, and let me tell you, if you are going to be using this for more than a pitch or two, you certainly want to have a tripod and the spring mount for the top. When you are not using the PRBC, it&rsquo;s great for iPhones and other smartphones to take pictures or movies.I am a HUGE fan of this package. Could not be happier.</p>

<h5 id="ball-coach-with-blue-button-is-outstanding-unit-very-accurate">Ball Coach with Blue button is OUTSTANDING unit. Very Accurate.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ball Coach with blue button is outstanding&hellip; works even better than i expected.. compare with a thousand dollar gun. Several years ago I tried pocket radar with red button at battng cage several times. First generation unit not consistant and difficult to use. Ball Coach blue button is outstanding.See last paragraph for negative comment.My grandson is 15U catcher on travel team. Saw reviews and decided to take a chance. I would highly recommend. Tried Ball Coach behind L screen, behind wire fence at ball field, even slight angle. One of grandson&rsquo;s friend is a pitcher. Using high priced gun, he threw between 75 and 78 with fastball Ball Coach gave same reading.This will be a great to encouage long toss and increase arm strength. Just as a stopwatch helps imporve 30 and 60 yard times, the Ball Coach will give players a way to measure progress.Recall and continous mode work perfect. My grandson has POP time of 1.95 and calls pitches. Bought this for helping him impove POP time over the winter when only indoor facilities with 90 foot cages are available. Will be good for him learning change up for different pitchers he catches.Great for measuring ball exit speed and one of the five tools which is throwing speed.Focus Tripod is a piece of junk. Don&rsquo;t get discourage when you open box. I almost sent everything back&hellip;Glad I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;.. I have very good 35mm tripod and used this with tripod attachment. Worked great. I requested new tripod.Will update if company sends replacement&hellip;..RECEIVED REPLACEMENT..COMPANY REPLACED BROKEN TRIPOD..OUTSTANDING SERVICE</p>

<h5 id="radar-unit-works-well-accessories-are-a-bit-disappointing">Radar unit works well, accessories are a bit disappointing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this as a kit, came with the tri-pod, battery charger etc&hellip; I figured why not, it&rsquo;s the same price as just buying the Ball coach by itself.The Ball Coach seems to operate well, I am having some problems picking up readings sometimes, but I believe that is just a placement issue. As I experiment, I assume I&rsquo;ll get better at it. I put it on the tri-pod just behind a backstop and &ldquo;peeking&rdquo; around the edge. I&rsquo;m trying to minimize the odds of it or the tri-pod getting hit by a wild pitch that I may not be able to stop. so the unit itself seems to work good even though I don&rsquo;t have anything to compare it to. I&rsquo;ll refer you to youtube as others have already done the comparisons (that&rsquo;s the reason I bought this unit in the first place).That being said, the rest of the kit isn&rsquo;t of real high quality. The tri-pod is pretty cheap and flimsy, etc&hellip; but it was basically free so I&rsquo;m not going to knock it. The review should really be about the radar unit, not the free bundled accessories. I&rsquo;d recommend this unit</p>

<h5 id="pr-ball-coach-used-in-212-athlete-elite-pitcher-training-increases-safety">PR Ball Coach used in 212 ATHLETE Elite Pitcher Training Increases Safety</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a throwing development coach who focuses on strengthening the arm and increasing velocity of baseball players tracking their progress and keep them safe is a huge priority. I am able to help kids get huge jumps in velocity in a short amount of time and it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to track their progress without Pocket Radar Ball Coach! I have used almost all the guns out there Stalker, Juggs, Bushnell(WORST), and since finding and using Ball Coach I have been very pleased with the accuracy, the continuous settings that allows me to coach while they throw, 25 throw recall, and not to mention the size of the device. Also this gun allows me to get reading without having kids see it and start changing their mechanics to throw harder which almost always inevitably produces less velocity. They don&rsquo;t know its there sometimes and I can get their average throws clocked. On top of recording velocities for improvement Pocket Radar Ball Coach allows me to know when they dip in velocity to know when to have them stop and start on arm care exercises. Radar Guns should be used as safety devices (even though novice coaches don&rsquo;t see them as such) because some kids who like to throw a lot might not dip in velocity the whole baseball game which means they have the endurance to keep going.Check out our progress at www.212athlete.com and on FacebookBest Radar Gun I Have Ever Bought,Adrian Gomez</p>

<h5 id="surprisingly-accurate-durable-for-the-price">Surprisingly accurate &amp; durable for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked exactly as advertised. We used it to profile ball speeds sports lab setting for some research by an engineering intern. The product seemed pretty accurate (when compared to chronographing speeds with a camera), but gave us real-time feedback and the ability to set-up and move the device. It took a couple direct hits from the ball, got knocked off the tripod &amp; still kept working fine.</p>
