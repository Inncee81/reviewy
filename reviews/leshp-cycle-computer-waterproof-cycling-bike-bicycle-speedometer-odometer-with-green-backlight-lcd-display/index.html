<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-so-far">Good so far!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently installed this but have not had enough time to do a proper review. This is mainly about the setup process.I got this for its backlight. Often I ride at night and it&rsquo;s useful to have the backlight.The setup instructions were reasonably easy to understand. The sensor magnet is ceramic rather than neodymium so placement is more critical and the gap needed is small. The battery sensor is a bit larger than it would be with neodymium magnet. Placement of the computer itself is also critical. The optimum reading angle is between about 60 and 90 degrees to the face. At 90 degrees the display drops off quickly. Initially I put the computer roughly parallel to my face and found it often hard to read. Repositioning it to about 75 degrees made it easier to read.Setting all the numbers was about as difficult as other computers I have used. There are many features on this computer and it takes a bit of getting used to. So far it seems to be good.100 mile update - still good!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-my-purchase">Happy with my purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one I received either broke or never worked right. I wrote a one star review explaining all the problems I had with it and was ready to get a different one. The seller contacted me asking for a second chance. They were very polite and professional and sent a replacement very quickly. They were very easy to deal with and actually read my complaints and made improvements. I am very impressed and happy with the seller. The new computer works perfectly. I love the temperature, time and current speed readings, and the distance is great too. There are more functions than I will probably ever use, but it shows everything I want to know and is a perfect size. Not too big but the writing is not too small.</p>

<h5 id="bicycle-computer">Bicycle computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice bicycle computer. It has many functions so it will take some time to get used to.Some of my favorite features are the green backlight screen, it measures miles,and has adjustable tire size. Works great, came with the cable ties to mount on bike. I&rsquo;m still learning all the functions but it measures accurately and listing states it is waterproof.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bike-computer">Great Bike Computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, Great Bike Computer. Does everything I need. Bright display in the daytime and easy to read at night with touch of a button. It even has temperature readout. Very easy install. The only downside is the wire to the sensor is too short for my recumbent bike (had to mount on lower part of handlebars).Yes it is a pain to setup, but no more difficult the other bike computers i have used. There a You tube videos that can help.Suggestions to Vendor:Offer Longer cable option for recumbent bikesWire ties may be too short for attaching sensor to front fork on some bikes (like mine)Battery was already installed. (may be an issue if stock is old)Take instruction sheet and triple it size.Provide URL to HOW TO Install/setup videos or PDF documentsAll in all a great purchase at a awesome price (Less the $10.00)</p>

<h5 id="great-little-bike-computer">Great little bike computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this after trying a wireless bike computer that I had no luck with at all, kept losing its connection and stop working, so I went KISS with this purchase and could not be happier. OK, you need a magnifying glass to read the instructions but I did not ding them for that, the instructions were actually pretty good, both installation and set-up.Set up is pretty easy, you get your tire size and there is a chart that tells you what to enter so speed and distance are accurate, you enter the time and that is about it, pick MPH or KPH and C/F, all pretty straight forward. I like that the backlight can be turned on for just a few seconds or turn-on and stay on. The stop watch is handy and also easy to use. Just one button to switch between info on the screen.I recommend this to strangers and friends looking for a reliable basic bike computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cc-for-the-price">Great cc for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cc for the price. As the other reviewers have stated, the instructions can use a native speaker translation, but otherwise the thing works as designed. So far it seems to be very accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="difficult-set-up">Difficult set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very difficult to set up with the included instructions. My advice is to avoid and get another type. I was able to set the time and adjust the temperature and distance to US standards, but was never able to get the tire circumference set. Ended up just removing the batteries for my other bike computers and throwing these things out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-bicycle-computer">Love this bicycle computer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great bicycle computer at a great price! The display is big and bright. I see the current speed, current time, trip time and distance all at the same time. With a push of a button I see other stats and THE TEMPERATURE! Love it. Set up was fairly easy. It seems very accurate with the specific wheel size programmed as per directions. I also use a GPS tracking app on my Android phone, and the distance is spot on. It even fit the snap in handlebar unit from my old Bell odometer which means I didn&rsquo;t need to rewire or attach the new magnet on the spoke at all. In the past I have tried a wireless computer, but I didn&rsquo;t find that very reliable, and so I prefer the wired type. I would highly recommend this and would definitely buy the same again.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-nice-little-gadget-here">Pretty nice little gadget here</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty nice little gadget here, it fits nicely on my bike and is small enough to not get in the way. It is pretty accurate when compared with Strava.</p>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="speedometer-stopped-working-after-27-minutes">Speedometer stopped working after 27 minutes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Item stopped working after only 27 minutes of use, would not buy again. Terrible instructions and poor quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="uh-yahn">Uh, yahn!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>*Theoretically, the bicycle computer works, but there seems to be no way to get past the temperature F, and clock 12H, after that, it&rsquo;s a DEAD END!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little computer, definitely recommend</p>

<p>Never was able to get it to work. Piece of crap.</p>

<h5 id="simple-straight-forward-to-use-gadget">Simple Straight Forward to Use Gadget.</h5>

<p>Quality product. Has been received, the computer is small and exquisite, installation is quite simple, I feel with a pretty good.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little bike computer. Love the fact that it is wireless for a nice clean install. Gave them away as gifts and they have stated how much they liked them. Recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-item">Great item.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this speedometer a lot. It&rsquo;s very accurate, easy to install and the menu is easy to figure out. And this is a very nice computer for the price.</p>
