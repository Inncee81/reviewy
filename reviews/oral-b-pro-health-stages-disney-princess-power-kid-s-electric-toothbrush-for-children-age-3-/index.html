<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="batteries-included">Batteries included!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice toothbrush. The price is great. One thing thing that stands out that makes this toothbrush​ different from other mechanical ones is that the head spins very fast. I am not sure how I feel about this feature. I think that it should be cleaning the teeth better because it spins so fast. However, because it spins so fast, my daughter is afraid of it. Something that we have to work on I suppose.The overall quality is great, and the price simply can&rsquo;t be beat. I am very happy with this purchase. I wish I could find a boy or unisex version for the same price!Batteries were included with this, which I found to be a nice surprise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="turned-brushing-teeth-time-into-the-best-part-of-the-day">Turned Brushing Teeth Time into the Best Part of the Day!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the best purchase!!! Brushing teeth used to be a huge battle with my daughters. We skipped way too many mornings because I would forget to remind them when I was busy getting ready for work. And we skipped too many nights because my daughter would be overtired and need to go bed ASAP and it just wasn&rsquo;t worth the battle. I only purchased this toothbrush because it was on sale for very cheap and I needed a prize for my daughters for completing their rewards chart and I thought they would like anything with princesses on it. What I didn&rsquo;t know is that there is an app that comes with this toothbrush that times them for 2 minutes while they watch a Disney picture get uncovered. My daughter (5 years old) looks forward to brushing her teeth, never forgets morning or night, and brushes for the whole 2 minutes. On top of that, she is so excited by it that she encourages her sister (3 years old) to brush her teeth and helps out! Definitely recommend this toothbrush!</p>

<h5 id="it-was-just-disgusting-what-we-saw-was-coming-out-from-inside">It was just disgusting what we saw was coming out from inside</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t BUY this toothbrush for your kids. After one and an half month of using it, We discovered it was full of mold inside the toothbrush. I took a water pick and start to clean it right inside&hellip;and OMG!!! It was just disgusting what we saw was coming out from inside. I regret that I didnt take a picture of it. But I believe that this toothbrush should recall due to its emptiness inside and it stores all debris. Awful experience!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-no-sonicare">Works, but no Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works pretty well but is definitely no sonicare. The handle is nice and large for little hands, but the actual tooth brush head is rather large. The battery life is great.However, I would recommend spending a little extra and getting a Sonicare Kids toothbrush</p>

<h5 id="a-miracle-baby-started-brushing-her-teeth">A miracle, baby started brushing her teeth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 15 mo old has always allowed us to attempt to brush her teeth LOL briefly for a few seconds here and there. With this toothbrush she loves the vibration and being able to turn it on and off because she&rsquo;s in the middle of discovering how to do things on her own, and as a result she&rsquo;s actually brushing her own teeth without realizing it LOL. Made my job easy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 21 month old loves this! I don&rsquo;t have to worry about her brushing correctly since the head of the toothbrush spins on it&rsquo;s own so I know it&rsquo;s at least cleaning the couple of teeth she touches with it. It&rsquo;s fun for her to use and motivating to let mommy brush her teeth first and then she gets to &ldquo;use&rdquo; it. The price is a steal too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-recommended-for-3-year-old-but-should-be-fine-for-older-girls">Not recommended for 3 year old, but should be fine for older girls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is bigger than we expected and makes a lot of noise. Was it worth the 5 bucks (I ordered 2 so it was 10 bucks)? We are keeping the second one until my 3 year old gets older. The first one will probably get tossed out soon (hate to, but it takes up space). It is not as good as the 10 dollar Target ones are, but maybe for older kids, it is fine. I say this due to my daughter&rsquo;s choice of using a non-electric one over this. The pictures are good on the toothbrush, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kids-look-forward-to-brushing-their-teeth-and-brush-longer">Kids look forward to brushing their teeth and brush longer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great for getting your kids to brush their teeth longer. They love the spinning of it, and they got to choose which character they wanted. My pediatric dentist also said she recommended the spinning brushes for exactly that reason &ndash; kids love them and they will brush longer. They also help clean their teeth better since kids tend to not be so great at really brushing around and cleaning their own teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="game-changer">Game changer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My three year old loves brushing her teeth with this toothbrush! It&rsquo;s cute and priced right!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too big for my 2 y/o.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter loves Disney Princesses and I love that it makes her want to brush her teeth. I also like electric toothbrushes because they make it more fun to brush, and your teeth&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="won-t-last-long">won&rsquo;t last long</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the brush maintained its shape for 1 month at best</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="2-year-old-approves">2 year old approves</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2 yr old really likes this. I hold it for her and show her the right way. She looks forward to brushing now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-starter-spin-brush-but-we-did-upgrade-to-a">Good starter spin brush but we did upgrade to a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good starter spin brush but we did upgrade to a sonic care for kids because it doesn&rsquo;t vibrate as hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gift-for-the-granddaughters">great gift for the granddaughters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>got a little gift for the grand girls&hellip;keep those teeth sparkly..may have to get two more for them to have on at my house.</p>
