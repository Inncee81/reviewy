<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased this in November 2016 with the soul purpose of integrating my new Amazon Echo with it to voice control my house. My current set includes: Amazon echo in the kitchen, an Amazon dot in the playroom, an Amazon dot in our master bedroom, approaching 30 different GE Zwave and Zwave+ light switches/dimmers and add on switches (more on that later) and 3 HUE colored light bulbs (more on that later, as well).Goods:1. Pretty easy installation of the hub and app2. Easy recognition of newly installed z-wave devices3. Very active community board with multiple &ldquo;How-To&rsquo;s&rdquo; and FAQs on the smartthing website to help with productsBad:1. The Hub is moderately priced, but buying devices to integrate into the hub is dang expensive2. Occasionally, does not always do what it is meant to do3. Hub has to be plugged directly into the routerDownload the app (I have an iPhone 5). Plug in the hub and DIRECTLY CONNECT THE HUB TO THE ROUTER. This means that the hub has to be in close proximity of the router (I have the latest generation of Apple&rsquo;s AirPort, which hasn&rsquo;t changed in 5+ years). Follow the instructions on the app and you&rsquo;re up and running! I had no issues.Integration goes like this: Purchase GE Zwave light switch, which runs between $35 an $40 a pop! There may be cheaper ones, but not by much. (I recommend staying with the same brand throughout your house. It makes it easier to trouble shoot later on.) Multiply that by how many switches you have in your house! But, you can do this one switch at a time. No need to do all of them all at once. Turn off breaker. Pull out old single switch. Connect the black line wire to the LINE connector on the zwave switch (this is the power coming into the switch box). Connect the black load wire to the LOAD connector on the new switch (this is the black wire coming from the light to power it). Now, these switches need to be connected to the white Neutral wire that is crumbled up in the back of the switch box. These switches come with a pliable extra white wire. Wire nut the whites together. Turn on the breaker and the blue LED light comes on that&rsquo;s on the switch. Test the switch manually to make sure that you can turn on and off the light. If the blue lights not on, you probably have the black wires switched. Open the app, tap on &ldquo;Add a Thing&rdquo;, press up on the switch and the hub recognizes the new switch. Rename it and you&rsquo;re set.Sounds complicated, but the hardwiring the switch is more complicated than integrating the new switch with the Hub. With the app, I have it set so when both my phone and my wife&rsquo;s phone break connection with our home wi-if, SmartThings turns off everything. (Have to always remember to remind the babysitter!)Amazon Echo has it&rsquo;s own app that needs to be integrated, but SmartThings has step by step instructions on that. Had no problem. Now I say, &ldquo;Alexa, turn off living room lights&rdquo; and all the lights in the living room turn off. Awesome!The only problem I have had is with 3 way switches. This is where there are 2 or more switches doing the same light. When you pull out the switch on these bad boys, you&rsquo;ll be met with black, white and red wires. These are wired differently than normal 3 way switches. The way it is suppose to work is that there is one main zwave switch and an add on switch (which has no receiver). When you press the add on switch, it&rsquo;s suppose to turn off the lights AND send a signal to the main switch, to send a signal to the Hub, so that it registers as on/off on the app. I&rsquo;ve had some of the newer zwave+ switches that do not register on the app. I.e., I turn off the light with the add on switch, but the app still says the light is on. Not a big deal, but it is annoying. This has only happened on the newer GE 14xxx Zwave switches with the older 12xxx add on switches.Besides this issue, everything has worked flawlessly. Other issues that have appeared are due to my figuring out complex 3 way switches that power multiple different lights. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone interested in an easy entry into home automation!READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATED (June 21, 2016) REVIEW:After much frustration in late 2015 and early 2016, I have to update my review again (I&rsquo;ve gone from 1 star to 3 stars, and now to 5 stars).Over the past few months, our entire SmartThings hub and ecosystem has been performing nearly-flawlessly. Kudos to the SmartThings team for all of the firmware updates and capacity upgrades. They are obviously improving the system dramatically. Things just work now and I don&rsquo;t have to even think about it. I&rsquo;ve got my fingers crossed that these improvements will last.ORIGINAL REVIEW:After a few months of successful testing with the v1 hub, I decided to go all-in with Smartthings over the past few months. I&rsquo;ve now invested over $1800 in devices and migrated everything to the v2 hub. Everything seemed to begin going downhill once I switched to the 2nd gen. hub.Smartthings has always had its quirks, but over the past few weeks it has gotten so bad that it has become a complete nuisance. The biggest issue by far is that routines are failing constantly. We woke up this morning to a cold house (the thermostat failed to trigger), a dark house (all the lights failed to trigger), and a blaring alarm when opening the door (the alarm failed to disarm). When we arrived home, I hit the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Home&rdquo; routine and again the alarms sounded upon entering for reasons unknown and the house was dark.At this point I&rsquo;m ready to find our 20 year-old Honeywell programable thermostat, go back to timers with dials on the lights, and fire up the ancient ADT alarm system again. Things were much easier and worked much better the good old-fashioned way. I&rsquo;ve actually managed to dumb-down our house with Smartthings.Smartthings would be great if things worked as they&rsquo;re supposed to work, but I&rsquo;m finding myself spending hours in the forums each day and reprogramming routines trying to troubleshoot all the issues. It&rsquo;s cause for great celebration if a day without problems. It&rsquo;s just not worth it anymore. Time to pull the plug on Smartthings and hope some other miracle hub comes along to take advantage of all the Zigbee and Z-wave devices we&rsquo;ve accumulated.READ MORE</p>
