<h5 id="disappointing-for-a-class-10-card">Disappointing for a Class 10 Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this card to upgrade my Pentax k-x from the 4 GB class 4 SD card I received when I purchased it. I definitely needed more storage for shooting in RAW but I was also looking for a good speed increase for burst mode, and I was hoping this card could satisfy both of my needs at a modest price. The size is definitely there but the speed is very disappointing. Using multiple disk testers I&rsquo;ve only been able to push out ~5 megabytes/second maximum write speed but the average remains much lower, only around 3 megabytes/second. Read speeds usually hover around 7 megabytes/second. The box claims the card is capable of up to a 20 MB/s read and 15 MB/s write but my data comes no where near those numbers and I have no idea how they arrived at them. After reading the terrible reviews of the Kingston 16 GB Class 10 Secure Digital Flash Card SD10/16GB I was hoping that this second generation would have fixed those problems, now I&rsquo;m just hoping it doesn&rsquo;t corrupt my data.Update: I hoped that I could still use this card on a day-to-day basis and overlook the speed issue, but the slowness of it is noticeable and a reminder that I&rsquo;m not getting what I paid for. Sending it back for a refund and going to spend a bit more on a much better card.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="kingston-we-have-a-problem">Kingston, we have a problem&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to the purchase of this item (&ldquo;Kingston 16 GB Class-10 SDHC card&rdquo;), I have bought several other Kingston memory cards, including the Kingston 16 GB Class 4 SDHC and Kingston 8 GB Class 4 microSDHC Card. They were all reasonably priced, and performed up to specifications. So I never had a problem with Kingston - until this time.I benchmarked the Kingston SD10G2 card upon its arrival. The result I got was so appalling that I have to re-run the tests on two different computers to confirmed it: This so-called &lsquo;Class-10&rsquo; card is actually much slower than any of the &lsquo;class-4&rsquo; SDHC card I have ever tested before!- When writing small files of 1MB each, the speed of this card is painfully slow at just 0.8MB/s- When writing larger files of 5MB each, the speed increased to 4.9MB/s(see the screen capture I uploaded to Customer Images section for details)- Only when writing a huge file of 1GB size, the speed finally reached 10.7MB/s.In contrast, the Transcend 16GB TS16GSDHC10 (which is also classified as &lsquo;class-10&rsquo;) delivered 9.9MB/s when writing 1MB files, and 12.8MB/s for 5MB files. In fact, even my previous Kingston 16GB class-4 card gave much better results of 3.7 and 8.0MB/s, respective.In order for a SDHC card to be marketed as &lsquo;class-10&rsquo;, it must have a sequential read/write speed of at least 10 Mega Byte per second. This Kingston card barely meets the requirement under the most optimal test condition. However, when used in a digital camera (either point-and-shoot or SLR), this so-called &lsquo;class-10&rsquo; card actually performs much wosre than a typical class-4 card.As of this writing, you can buy other cards (such as the HP 16 GB Class 4 SDHC) for less but get better overall performance than this Kingston card. Also as a matter of principle, I refuse to support any company engaging in this kind of deceptive marketing techniques. This card is going back for a refund, and I will be leery of other Kingston products from now on.[Update on Aug 8, 2011]A Kingston representive contacted me concerning my problem with the write speed. However, I have already returned this Kingston card and purchased a PNY 16 GB Class 10 SDHC Card P-SDHC16G10-EF. The PNY card gave me a solid class-10 performance. See my Amazon review on it for details.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY4QHXNJTEWP/READ">http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY4QHXNJTEWP/READ</a> MORE</p>

<h5 id="we-lost-our-1-year-old-s-1st-trip-to-the-petting-zoo">We lost our 1 year old&rsquo;s 1st trip to the petting zoo.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>16gb card failed in my wife&rsquo;s camera at the petting zoo (at the end of the day). Many cool pictures were lost and I lost points as I provide technical support (so any technology issues are my problem) :-) Other cards have worked fine in her Nikon so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the camera and now I see that plenty of other people are having issues. I&rsquo;ve used Kingston Memory in computers often, but it seems they didn&rsquo;t do a good job with this batch of cards. I thought I was safe going with a company where I had name recognition, but apparently not.It was a bummer because my sister was in town and we don&rsquo;t get to see her often, and the boy will not have another 1st trip to the petting zoo (though he will have more trips). I work in I.T., so I back up our photos as soon as we get home to our file server (which is backed up), but the pictures just never made it home.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="very-fast-card">Very Fast Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, of the three name brands of cards used in my Sony A77, this is the fastest one in real world use. With Sony&rsquo;s 24mp sensor the buffer tends to fill up quickly when shooting high speed sports. Although Sony recommends a class 6 or better card you can&rsquo;t go wrong spending the bit extra for a class 10. In a recent bicycle race photo shoot, with the A77&rsquo;s drive set to Hi (8 fps) I was able to capture about ten full size images (jpg X-Fine setting) before this card choked my camera waiting for buffer to write to the card. Although this is just over a second of shooting time, keep in mind that the <code>spray and pray' method of photography is not the best way to shoot. Shooting controlled bursts of 3-5 frames yield the best results. With a short pause between bursts, the Kingston card was able to keep up with the camera without making me wait for the buffer to clear. Although the two other brands of cards tried billed themselves at 10x, with slightly faster claimed write speed than the Kingston, neither one could keep up with the buffer under my normal event shooting mode. I'm glad the Kingston was the first card I put in my A77. The other two are being</code>retired&rsquo; to backup status.Alibi: I don&rsquo;t shoot much video, but the Kingston card did not cause any issues with the five minutes of video capture I tried.READ MORE</p>
