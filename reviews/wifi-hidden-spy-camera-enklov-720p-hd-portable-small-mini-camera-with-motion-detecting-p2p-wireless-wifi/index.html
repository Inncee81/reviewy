<h5 id="excellent-spy-camera-you-can-take-anywhere">Excellent spy camera you can take anywhere.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this little camera. My kids don&rsquo;t have any idea about this and I can check on them any time. There are a lot of little features to allow you to tweak this for your benefit. I have another little spy camera in our house that works with the same app, so this is a great addition.The best part about this spy camera is that it is fully portable. It has an attachment to allow you to connect it to a lithium battery (included). The camera lens has two different attachments to allow you to make it look like part of a button on your clothing. It will pick up sound. If you are within a relatively close range, another person can view it from their wifi connected device.This camera is very easy to use (once you get it set up). I had a little trouble at first. I was able to get it up and running, but not on my home network. After playing with it for the last week, I realized it was my own router that was causing the problem. I made some adjustments in the settings and was up and running and now I can check it from anywhere. I attached a photo to show you what some of the adjustment options are:- Alarm Config: You can set alarms as this does have a motion sensor. You can change the alarm sound, frequency/interval, email alert, schedule, motion detection sensitivity, etc.- WiFi Config: You can connect this to your home network, as I mentioned, so you can view the video from anywhere.- SD Card Record Config: This device does have a micro SD card slot (up to 32GB). You can change the record options - record all day, based on alarm, or at specified times. Change record duration to determine file size, include sound, loop record.- Time Settings: There is a time stamp in the video frame. This is where you set the local time and time zone. It can automatically update from the time.nist.gov site so it&rsquo;s always the correct time. It even allows you to adjust for DST.- Email Config: You can set up email notifications through your desired SMTP server.- FTP Config: With an FTP, you can directly record the videos to another location, so you don&rsquo;t have to keep messing with the microSD card. I haven&rsquo;t tried that, but great idea.- Misc Settings: The side of the charging block / camera has a light to indicate that it is on and running. In the Misc Settings, you can turn that off to make it more inconspicuous.- Change Password: You can set a password to this camera. I definitely recommend changing it from the default.When you are actually viewing the video (livestream), you have some other options with the video frame. You can flip/rotate the view, adjust the brightness, turn sound/microphone on/off, manually turn recording on/off, change the video resolution, color/black&amp;white.The instruction pamphlet was pretty detailed and walks you through everything&hellip;including downloading software onto your computer to view the cameras on your computer.It also comes with a USB card reader, lithium battery, and two different button-like adapters to hide the camera.I am very pleased with this device.</p>

<h5 id="so-small-but-with-crisp-clear-video">So SMALL But With Crisp Clear Video!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This little camera is TINY; as in the size of a button! It&rsquo;s also 720P HD and wireless.The camera can be remotely viewed on your smart phone or iPad!The camera supports a Micro SD card up to 128GB. No SD card arrives with the camera so be sure to grab one when you order your camera.Let me start by saying I had absolutely zero problems getting the camera up and running. The camera was a breeze to set up. I&rsquo;ve never had anything arrive with such detailed instructions WITH photos!! Step by STEP!! Download the app and within 3 minutes I was walking around the house making a video.HOLY GUACAMOLE BATMAN this camera takes great pictures and videos!!A smart camera that sets the time without you having to mess with anything! Time and date are correct from the start. Set the camera up with motion detection as well as taking snapshots.The battery is a 3800mAh high capacity rechargeable lithium battery which will allow me to 10 HOURS of recording time.I am blown away at the sharpness of video that this little camera provides! WOW!!! I can even download the video straight to my phone without the Micro SD card! The video that I have included is straight from my phone. Not on a SD card.I charged the battery overnight but the booklet says that the battery will be fully charged in 2 to 3 hours. A fully charged battery gives me over 7 hours of video time!Not only can I wear this camera and disguise it as a button!! But I could also hide it around the house and watch remotely from my phone. I love that I can watch the 5-year-old remotely!I&rsquo;m thoroughly pleased.</p>

<h5 id="good-deal-great-camera-can-be-hidden-anywhere-not-waterproof-not-for-night-vision">Good deal. Great camera. Can be hidden anywhere. Not waterproof. Not for night vision.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, here&rsquo;s the deal with pinhole cameras like these. You will be able to hide this thing anywhere, but night vision is really not there. For that, you need infrared, and you just can&rsquo;t get that with a camera like this. That said, any good PI should have multiple ways of recording. This is one method that really can be placed anywhere.The video quality on this is not full HD, but it is HD (720p). That is good enough to capture what you need.Because this is set up like a deconstructed unit, it allows for a huuuuge battery. The battery is 3800mAh. To put that in perspective, the iPhone 7S Plus has a battery smaller than this camera&hellip;2900 mAh.Using this has a learning curve. You&rsquo;ll need to read the instructions through. A combination of button pushing is how you&rsquo;ll get it recording, taking stills, etc. It has WiFi capability, and the app is decent. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it gets the job done.Overall, this is one of three cameras I have like this, and I think it&rsquo;s a good deal. You&rsquo;ll need your own microSD card.</p>

<h5 id="portable-and-useful-spy-cam">Portable and Useful Spy Cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I have lots of great reasons to give this spy camera a 5-Star Review - and one of the best reasons is its high definition, high quality video. Another reason is the fact that this camera can be hidden in countless places and ways to insure you are getting truly candid video. Additionally, you have the choice of using its memory card (purchased separately) or to watch live video on your smart phone and record pictures, and video (including sound). One note for those purchasing this camera. The videos you see in my review were recorded on my phone as .asf files. I used free software called VideoPad Video Editor to convert them to .wmv files with which I used for this little video presentation. I highly recommend this camera.</p>

<h5 id="this-little-camera-is-the-bomb">This little camera is the BOMB!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not be deceived though as setup can be challenging like any other network device, but I love this camera. I am a computer geek so I do not read the instructions and found setup somewhat predictable but ran into a couple of issues to assist others. I plugged in the camera thru the usb cable to charge the battery; be sure to connect the red connectors from the battery to the camera. I turned the camera to on and plugged in the usb to charge for a few hours before setup and had not problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tiny">Tiny!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing how far micro engineering has come. The camera itself is smaller than a shirt button and about half the size of a dime!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of-money">Waste of money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not working as expected, android application has a mess of user interface, connection issues, motion alarm recording works occasionally, video quality is low.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ez-it-isn-t">EZ, it isn&rsquo;t</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pain to set up and the instructions aren&rsquo;t the best. I didn&rsquo;t get the advertised 5 auxiliary lens covers either&hellip; no biggie, just saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-someone-please-help-me-i-can-t-access-to">Can someone please help me. I can&rsquo;t access to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can someone please help me. I can&rsquo;t access to my camera because It says wrong password and I don&rsquo;t know what the password is. I&rsquo;ve never change it so I don&rsquo;t know the original.</p>

<h5 id="great-spy-camera">Great Spy Camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this wee spy camera. It is very discreet and it works well with my phone. The sound and the picture is good quality.</p>

<h5 id="universal-kit">Universal kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a very unique kit, that can be installed just about anywhere you can imagine it. I like the options to put it where I want so that others will not recognize the usual&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="spy-camera-that-practically-disappears-when-using">Spy camera that practically disappears when using!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Spy camera that practically disappears when using!I won&rsquo;t say why I purchased this but let&rsquo;s just say that it is completely invisible when recording even though it is&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-can-hide-this-anywhere">You can hide this anywhere!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This hidden spy camera is great! The actual camera is smaller than the one on the back of a cell phone.</p>

<h5 id="easy-set-up-works-great">Easy set up, works great</h5>

<p>I found this easy to set up, and used the BV Cam app that I already had on my phone and it went very fast and without any problems.</p>
