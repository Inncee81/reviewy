<h5 id="samsung-earns-loyalty">Samsung Earns Loyalty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest reason I&rsquo;m writing this review is to thank the folks at Samsung for being a part of a rock solid company. Fanboy? Yep, and here is why&hellip;I bought a Sumsung 65HU9000 4K TV almost exactly 2 years ago, and recently purchased the K8500 4K player. Although the player ran BluRays beautifully at 1080p, the 4K discs would not play as the HDMI 4 port in the tv was not recognized as being HDCP 2.2 compliant ( as I understand it, HDCP 2.2 is a encryption protocol designed to prevent piracy - 4K discs simply will not play on a TV that isn&rsquo;t compliant). I called Samsung tech support and after an exhaustive differential diagnostic process, it was determined that either the TV or the player had a hardware problem. This is the cool part - instead of making me pay a couple hundred bucks for a new One Connect box that might or might not solve the problem on a very out of warrantee tv, they gave me an extended warranty for free and had a tech drive to my home and fix the tv (the one connect box was the problem as it turns out - the tech simply gave me a new one and installed it for free). In a nutshell, Samsung chose to spend a few hundred dollars to delight me, when they could easily have taken the typical &ldquo;car dealership&rdquo; approach which is to basically screw you out of every penny possible both coming and going.Hmmmmmm&hellip; That was almost a rant, sorry about that. On to the performance of the player&hellip;I had a friend over last night and we watched Star Wars The Force Awakens on BluRay, and The Martian on 4K UltraHD disk. We also compared the opening scene of The Martian on BluRay and 4K Disc by playing them back to back. Our non-technical consensus was that there was a big jump in picture quality from the BluRay to the 4K for that particular movie. We tried the same thing with the Wave scene in San Andreas, and couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference (we &ldquo;blinded&rdquo; ourselves in this little subjective experiment - she swapped the discs without telling me which type was playing, and visa versa). Star Wars was gorgeous on BluRay at 1080p - I can&rsquo;t wait to see it in 2160p when/if they offer a 4K release. I saw it in an IMAX theatre, and I frankly thought the picture was better on my home system.At the end of the day, if you are in a position to indulge your curiosity as to how far home picture quality has come, go for it! If you are a videophile on a tight budget, wait a bit, and this will drop in price especially as other players like LG, Sony, etc jump into the game. Also, realize that not all 4K discs are or will be made equal.I hope you found this review to be useful!</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-4k-hdr-image-quality-slow-apps-and-menu-navigation">Fantastic 4K HDR image quality, slow apps and menu navigation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this player to go with my new Samsung UN65KS8000 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV. The image quality on 4K HDR DVDs is amazing. I am using AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cables for everything and my TV properly recognizes when HDR content is played on this player.The additional features like Samsung apps are okay, but they are a bit slow to open and run, so I am using the apps on my TV instead. The menu navigation on this player is slow to respond to clicks on the remote so it gets a bit frustrating to have such a state of the art player that feels antiquated because of how slow it responds to the remote.If you are going to use this primarily as a Blu-ray player, it is awesome. But if you will be using apps, buy a newer and faster player.On a side note, I purchased a used one here on Amazon and it still had someone else&rsquo;s Samsung account and e-mail address signed into it. I reset the player to defaults to make sure that this user was no longer associated with the device and so it was set up to my liking. Tip: if you are going to return something, always make sure you reset it to defaults first so your information is not compromised. :)</p>

<h5 id="good-box-horrible-remote">Good box, horrible remote.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was to replace a perfectly working Panasonic smart player to get better start up speed, etc. This box does that. It&rsquo;s reliable and solid. I have to call out the remote as a piece of trash. So much so it eats two stars. Samsung, why such a pos remote? At least spend some time to make a phone app as an alternative? Really ruins the experience of the decent box fidgeting with the tiny remote with keys on top of each other in the dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hdcp-2-2">HDCP 2.2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beware to HDCP 2.2 and high dynamic range. Otherwise it will play your UHD blu ray like normal blu ray. But on a 4K monitor, Samsung, which I have, I don&rsquo;t see any visible difference. If the blu ray has been mastered like from an UHD source, then it&rsquo;s no problem if the player plays it only as normal blu ray because I have a monitor which doesn;t see properly HDCP 2.2. Visually they look stunning anyway.</p>

<h5 id="quality-4k-uhd-affordable-price-great-picture-and-sound">Quality 4K UHD, affordable price, Great Picture and Sound.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Quality and finally I got a 4k UHD (re-furbished) that I could afford to go with Panasonic 4k 1130k receiver and my 55 UHD Vizio TV. It all works perfectly (after I figured out how to make the Dolby Atmos sound to be recognized. Just don&rsquo;t select Surround but select Direct from the receiver, and then the information for the Dolby Atmos will be sent thru the receiver to speakers and the TV)</p>

<h5 id="4k-quality-is-great-plays-4k-blu-rays-easily">4k quality is great. Plays 4k blu rays easily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Plays perfectly&hellip;.very clear and pictures are outstanding. 4k quality is great. Plays 4k blu rays easily. My only little peeve. It seems to be delayed when the menus come out. Meaning, when the player loads and actually starts to show the menus&hellip;it seems to have missed a split second. I dont know if its the avr whose delayed but it only happens to the Samsung.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-curve">Beautiful Curve</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No trouble at all with this player.It really compliments the 4K TV.I don&rsquo;t know much about technical aspects, but it sure makes those 4K videos pop.</p>
