<h5 id="edited-real-nice-product-if-you-don-t-get-a-a-defective-one">EDITED: Real nice product, if you don&rsquo;t get a a defective one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edited Review 5-27-17: Great customer service&hellip; AERB saw my original review and the problems I was experiencing and suggested it was probably defective and sent me a replacement to try. After trying the replacement, I&rsquo;d have to agree. Apparently the problem with the original was the wireless transmission (USB dongle) was so erratic, the result was slow response, stuttering keys or none responsiveness at all. With the new unit, all is resolved (including a much longer wireless range) excepting for an occasional key stutter&hellip; Certainly within reason, given the extremely low price point. Kudos to their CS, standing behind their product.Original Review: Great idea to have the backlight, but the experience could be a whole lot better than it is, connected to my STB. The keys just randomly stutter and repeat, making entering text, masked passwords all but impossible. Other times keys just don&rsquo;t work, or have significant lag. It might just be a tiny bit better than a point and click remote with onscreen keyboard, and there may be better performing options out there.</p>

<h5 id="not-really-worth-your-time-or-money">Not really worth your time or money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace another brand that I had gotten on here, hoping that this would work better. However, it does not. I have it hooked to my LG smart tv, where other keyboard/mouse combos work and it barely works even standing 5 feet away. It has to spend 3-4 seconds reconnecting after every key or touchpad swipe, and types like &ldquo;wwwwww&hellip;.ggggggooooogggglleeeee&hellip;comm&rdquo; after 30 seconds of trying to type it in. It has a good feel and bright backlight, that&rsquo;s why it is getting the few stars it is. I&rsquo;m not sure if I got a defective one based on the other reviews, nonetheless, the one I got is, for a lack of better terms, crap.EDIT:The company saw my review and reached out to me about my problem. I&rsquo;ll give them an extra star for customer service. The figured the one that I received was defective, so they offered to send me the &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; one, however the only difference is the upgraded one lights up in colors, that&rsquo;s it. I received the new one, and it does work, maybe 30% better. I&rsquo;ve learned that if you&rsquo;re running anything 2.4ghz in the house (like majority of wifi routers) it&rsquo;s going to interfere with the remote and cause it to lag. It does work, but it&rsquo;s still far from the quality of a higher end wireless keyboard and mouse. I think that is just the way these are and I&rsquo;ve just had to settle with that. Still no 5 star, but at least a little better than the Rii one I had purchased originally before this one.</p>

<h5 id="great-keyboard-with-a-surprising-security-benefit">Great keyboard with a surprising security benefit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing little keyboard and touchpad. I initially purchased it to use as a kind of remote control for my computer. I have my PC set up in my bedroom/office and use a 40&rdquo; 4K television as my monitor. It also makes for a great screen for watching movies from my bed. The wireless keyboard is perfect for this. It has dedicated buttons for controlling the volume, an arrow pad for forwarding/rewinding, and shoulder buttons that serve as mouse clicks. Best of all, they keypad illuminates. The illumination is on a timer and turns on when you press any button, then shuts fifteen seconds later. Great for watching in the dark. You can also set the color of the illumination by hold down the Fn button and slide left or right on the touch pad. You can increase/decrease the brightness by sliding up or down. And you can turn the illumination off if desired.Other pros of the keypad:* Physical power switch on the back. Upon turning on, the keyboard responses almost instantly.* Barrery compartment holds the wireless receiver when not in use* Charges quickly, and battery life is measured in weeksIn addition to being used as a remote control, I&rsquo;ve found a couple other good uses for the keyboard. First, I attached it to my Android phone and it worked almost perfectly. This requires an OTG cable or connector, but once you have it, Android recognizes the keyboard and mouse. When using the touchpad you get an arrow on your phone or tablet&rsquo;s screen, and when entering text, you will not see the onscreen keyboard. I can type fairly quickly on the keyboard and I make fewer mistakes.However, the most interesting use I&rsquo;ve found for the keyboard is a security device. I use public computers on a fairly regular basis. Many public computers use virtualization software to make each session secure from other people installing malicious software that could read the names of passwords of another user. However, this does not stop someone from connecting a tiny hardware-based keyboard logger to either the keyboard or the port on the computer. Do a quick Google search and you can see how tiny and inexpensive these keyboard loggers are. Essentially any time you are entering sensitive information on a computer you don&rsquo;t have control of, there&rsquo;s a chance that a hardware logger is being used. This keyboard presents a great solution. Simply carry it with you, plug the receiver into a computer (no Admin rights requires) and use it to enter passwords, bank account numbers, or other information that you want to keep secure. While this won&rsquo;t prevent someone from using malware or other software to steal your info, it will completely shut down any hardware based attempts.Cons: I found two small issues with the keyboard; neither of which is enough to lower my review to 4-stars. First, the cursor speed of the touchpad is pretty low, even on the highest of the three settings. It works well for standard HD resolution displays, but for higher resolutions, it will take multiple touchpad widths to scroll even half of the screen. Second, I noticed that on my Android phone, I was not able to input capital letters by using the shift key. Pressing shift and one of the numbers would input the proper symbol (shift + 4 would give a $ sign), but shift + any letter still produced only a lower case letter. To write in upper case I had to use the caps lock toggle. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is an issue with the keyboard or my Android phone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: So it is a good product, you get a wireless keyboard + mouse for your TV, or computer connected to TV like my case.Pros+ Comfortable feel, all rubbery won&rsquo;t slip+ All keys are back lit.+ Great mousepad.+ Great navigation buttons on the top.Cons- Keys kind of hard for my taste when pressed.- So they went neutral putting the mousepad on the middle, which is unconfortable for me to use (right handed)- The drawings you see on the mousepad are permanent.- Battery is rechargeable, I would have preferred triple AAA or something more standard.Comparison with Lenovo and Logitech (see pictures)- Lenovo and Aerb are for little use, not to type a lot, if you would type a lot buy a big one like the Logitech.- Overall I would like the Lenovo better than the Aerb for the small size, because of the Cons in this review (subject to users interpretation).- Also it is great for me to have more, due that sometimes we are a lot of people in the same room controlling the same PC, so each has his own keyboard + mouse.</p>
