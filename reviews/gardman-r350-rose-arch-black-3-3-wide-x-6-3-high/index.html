<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-difficult-to-put-together">Very difficult to put together</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall quality is poor. Cheap plastic parts cracked when assembled. I would not recommend to anyone, if want something nice for the front yard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-advertised-works-well-with-light-fencing-and-runner-beans-in-a-garden">As advertised. Works well with light fencing and runner beans in a garden.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my rear garden so red runner green beans could climb. With a little care to pound guide holes in the ground then get a level to even things out, I had no problem with this. I covered it with a little roll of light american-like fence held on by twist ties. It all worked well. The biggest issue is the sturdiness of the individual metal tubes but only a little care is needed for this and the thinness of their walls keeps the weight down. Put into the ground carefully with a rubber mallet, this resisted even 50+ MPH wind storms with ease. When I got it out for the winter and moved it to the front walkway, I did bend one tube slightly as the unit fell partially over while that was still in the ground and that was my fault. The bend was not severe enough to worry about and it resides in front of our house now for winter decorations and hopefully some summer trumpet vines (I hope deer don&rsquo;t eat these). I&rsquo;ll be ordering another shortly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-defective-but-amazon-excellent">Product Defective But Amazon Excellent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This arch looked like a good value. The design is nice. However, when we tried to assemble it, they had not included the right parts. We contacted Amazon who sent us a replacement. That one also had issues and did not have the correct parts. Amazon acted in a professional and timely way to resolve this problem. I know it was not their fault because the factory sent out the defective products so to have them handle it in such a fair way was wonderful. I cannot say enough about their customer support. it was excellent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="save-yourself-some-frustration-and-also-order-some-black-duct-tape">Save yourself some frustration and also order some black duct tape!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Save yourself some frustration and also order some black duct tape to go along with this product. It a good utility Arch but you will most likely need to reinforce it with duct tape as the plastic connectors barely hold it together prior to installing it in the ground. I purchased if for my garden for my grape vines. I need to put some string or mesh on it to give the vines more to grab on to as the bars are about 12-18 inches apart. For the price it is a good deal. Just don&rsquo;t expect it to be great&hellip;. expect it to be a utility frame and for that the metal poles are sturdy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-needed-a-pretty-decent-arbor-arch-to-connect-the-two">we needed a pretty decent Arbor/ Arch to connect the two</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Item was exactly what I was looking for. My husband I purchased a Kiwi Tree (male and female) which we planted on either side and since they are very &ldquo;viny&rdquo; plants, we needed a pretty decent Arbor/ Arch to connect the two. All of the stores sold them too big for the area we needed or were too expensive. This arch was the perfect size for a reasonable price. It didn&rsquo;t seem very sturdy out the gate so I was a little leary, but we had a pretty big wind storm and this little guy stood strong. Great purchase, Great buy, great price for what we were looking for!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-fast-shipping">super fast shipping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>super fast shipping! arrived while I was still motivated to tear my old redwood one down, and easy to install- except I could not pound holes into our hard adobe soil and then easily pull them back out without bending it, so I just purchased four 3 ft. steel rods that I pounded in halfway and then just inserted the top half into the arbor support poles. It makes it higher, which I am happy with and the weight of the roses keep it firmly in place. I like the simplicity of it so that the roses are the feature now instead of the clunky redwood that rotted and fell apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-previously-stated">As previously stated&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As stated in a previous review, putting this together was not as straight forward as you would think and the biggest problem is that when you go to fastenl the anchoring screw for the plastic tees, they break. It is not a matter of over torquing because many cracked before the screw was even seated. Perhaps the fact that it was cooler weather had an influence, but regardless very poorly designed. The metal parts seem to be of decent quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-although-i-wasn-t-expecting-them-to-be-very-sturdy-for-the-price-i-paid-it-was-really-disappointing">and although I wasn&rsquo;t expecting them to be very sturdy for the price I paid it was REALLY DISAPPOINTING &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered two of these, and although I wasn&rsquo;t expecting them to be very sturdy for the price I paid it was REALLY DISAPPOINTING that not all pieces were in the box. One of the boxes is missing some of the struts and the whole bag with screws!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-rose-arch">Good rose arch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks great easy to put together. Good quality</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hard-to-assemble-poor-instructions">Hard to assemble. Poor instructions.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This arch was very difficult for me to assemble. The instructions were too succinct, and assumed more expertise than I have in putting things together.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used trhis for a friend&rsquo;s wedding with a long curtain scarf and silk flowers. It came out beautifully, and stood up the whole time!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-the-right-product">Just the right product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Met our needs perfectly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-and-sturdy">Solid and sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very solid and sturdy in the ground. It is not flimsy and it is not blowing over in the wind like the old one I had .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Arch is perfect for door way entrance.Thanks</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sturdy and good for creepers</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-sturdy-excellent-choice-easy-assembly">Beautiful, Sturdy-Excellent choice-easy assembly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very beautiful trellis &mdash;Cannot wait to see my beautiful roses climbing this arch. Gardening is stressful when you start, but well worth the wait for the results/harvest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! Easy to put the pieces together with the help of someone else. Great for the garden. Looks great!</p>
