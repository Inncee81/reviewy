<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My expectations have been exceeded. This is the 2nd mirrorless camera I tried. I did try the Sony a6000 1st, and it was OK, but seemed the colors were not true and even with the white balance at higher temperatures it still looked too cool. The 1j5 however has nice true colors. The controls and menu are very easy to use and once you have set up the wifi (on iPhone at least) it is very easy and has a fast response. The raw files are not supported in lightroom yet which is the norm for any new model camera that comes out, so I am shooting jpeg for now and with that I went back to using aperture priority and adjusting the exposure with exposure compensation (since I can&rsquo;t fix any of my booboo&rsquo;s yet). The butterfly was shot with aperture priority at 5.6, I had the picture set for vivid. My other cameras are a d3300 and d610 which are both awesome cameras in there own way. I got the 1 j5 for the small form factor and light weight, I bought the 10-100mm separate from this kit and that is the lens I am using. I did notice a potential problem in regards to over heating, as when the camera is on and shooting for a long time (45 mins or so) there is a white hot spot that shows up in the bottom right corner, once the camera cools down again it goes away. I just need to keep that in mind and if i plan on doing a whole lot of shooting pick up one of the dslr&rsquo;s. I have ordered the ft1 adapter so that I can use the 28-300 lens on it to get a reach of 810mm. All in all very pleased with this little cutie!</p>

<h5 id="fast-compact-improved-ergonomics-and-much-better-sensor">Fast, Compact, Improved Ergonomics and Much Better Sensor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nikon 1 J5 is very fast with an improved dynamic range over it&rsquo;s predecessors. They also reworked the looks giving it a bit more of a retro feel, which I quite like. Ergonomics have also been improved with a small hump for grip and the power switch is now a lever around the shutter button.But what&rsquo;s really improved is the sensor. Dynamic range and performance at high ISO is noticeably improved, exceeding even that of the Sony RX100 III.Do yourself a favour and get the 18.5 f/1.8 lens for every-day shooting. I also have the 32mm f/1.2 and it never fails to impress.I&rsquo;m really not a fan of the zoom lens though most would call me a camera nerd. It gets the job done, but it&rsquo;s slower than I prefer.I like Street Photography, and It&rsquo;s much more discreet than using a DSLR, it literally fits in the palm of your hand and the flip up screen is great in many situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-toldly-worth-the-money">Great buy toldly worth the money!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am an amateur photographer and this camera is great for those just starting out and even those who have experience will love camera. It&rsquo;s very fast to focus and can effectively shoot at its advertised frame rate. The only thing some may not like is that is a really small camera. If you are used to a big DSLR like I was the transition feels strange. But this pays out in amazing portibility because it&rsquo;s so small. Highly recommended it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-nikon-1-takes-great-photos-and-creates-both">The Nikon 1 takes great photos and creates both</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nikon 1 takes great photos and creates both .jpg (or .tiff) and .nef (raw) files. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a five star product, though, because the controls are so small, with correspondingly small lettering, that I found it difficult to use. It&rsquo;s easy enough to shoot snapshots, but for someone with less than excellent vision, setting up aperture priority or adjusting the exposure time in less than very bright sunlight is challenging. It&rsquo;s small size was convenient for travel, but ultimately was more challenging to use than I had hoped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-greatest-little-camera">This is the greatest little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the greatest little camera, video camera, etc. I love it and am just beginning to enjoy. I&rsquo;ll be even happier when some manuals start coming out. I have the downloaded users guide and reference manual, and they are about as good as company products get. I&rsquo;d recommend this camera to anyone looking for a small powerhouse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera-when-you-do-not-want-to-lug-your-dslr">Great Camera when you do not want to lug your DSLR</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received this camera and already love the quality of the optics and picture . I shoot a Nikon D80 and wanted the portability of a smaller camera without trading off on the quality of shots. The 1 J5 takes amazing photos and I really love the 10-100mm lens. Nikon continues to produce &ldquo;first in Class&rdquo; products and this camera is no different. Just ordered a 18.5mm lens to supplement my collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-on-my-trip-to-africa">Great on my trip to Africa!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a few improvements and I would give the camera 5 stars.What I liked-Great images! Crisp and clear shots.Easy to use video capture at a great quality.Size is just right to fit in a small compartment in my backpack.Wifi feature cool. I like downloading to my phone.I had many comments from people asking about my camera. It took better photos than my D3200What i did not like-wifi button i kept accidentally hitting it on safari while trying to capture a animal shot quickly.no viewfinder made it hard in bright sun to take a photo.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-performance-and-can-use-all-your-nikon-glass">Amazing performance and can use all your Nikon glass</h5>

<p>Amazing little camera with a full feature set&hellip;Takes great pictures and lets you use all of your Nikon glass if you also get the FT-1 F mount adapter</p>
