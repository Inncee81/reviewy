<blockquote>
<p>I stepped up from the bottom of the line Oral-B a while back to the &ldquo;Deep-Sweep&rdquo; 1000 and it was a DRAMATIC step up. I was amazed at the cleaning difference! I was convinced that spending more on a electric toothbrush was simply a waste of time and money. When my battery started getting weak&hellip;..I began my search for a replacement. I searched the web and all the Oral B models&hellip;&hellip;repeatedly. I was trying to justify the extra cost and features on the expensive tools. After much research&hellip;.and convincing myself&hellip;..I pulled the trigger on this 5000. I knew I was never going to use the &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo; feature&hellip;..but the powerful motor and longer battery life were the selling points for me.IS IT WORTH IT?? Well&hellip;&hellip;that depends. If you like super duper clean teeth that you can &ldquo;eat off of&rdquo;&hellip;..HECK YES!! This is a SERIOUS jump up in cleaning ability. I had no clue. The motor has a completely sound. More of a balanced high speed marvel with little to no vibration. Compared to the 1000 which &ldquo;putters and vibrates&rdquo; in comparison. The &ldquo;floss tip&rdquo; came with it&hellip;..and it removed a ton from my teeth and I have been using electric brushes for about 10 years now. It actually made my gums bleed a little bit and my teeth are MUCH whiter!I like the red light that will light up if you press too hard. Very cool that no matter what position the brush is in&hellip;..you can see the light! It takes very little effort to get an amazingly clean mouth! I actually use it more because I look forward to using it&hellip;..it is that good. The comfort, super smooth powerful motor and the squeaky clean it provides&hellip;..is just hard to resist! lol Who knew brushing could be a hobby! lolI also like the fact you can keep this on the charger at all times&hellip;..and only once every 6 months drain it. You do that with a Ni-cad battery and it will be useless in not time flat! I am assuming it is a Lithium battery because of this ability. Whatever the reason&hellip;..you &hellip;.your mouth&hellip;..and people that get close to your mouth will LOVE this brush! lol When is a brush worth this kind of money?? When you want to walk around with a &ldquo;just came from the dentist&rdquo; clean mouth and want to actually enjoy brushing your teeth on a pampered professional level&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;that&rsquo;s when! GT:)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This toothbrush replaced an Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush that was several years old and starting to show a lot of wear. I needed a new toothbrush anyway and the bluetooth feature intrigued me. After having used it for a few days I will say that I&rsquo;m very happy with the toothbrush itself. The brush head I was using was only 4 or 6 weeks old, so I just put my existing brush head on the new toothbrush and I was quite surprised that my teeth felt noticeably cleaner than when I brushed with my old triumph brush, even though I was using the exact same brush head. The triumph was in the same price range as this brush, so I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting any difference in brushing performance. This brush is also noticeably lighter than my old triumph.I&rsquo;m not sure how helpful the bluetooth feature really is, though. It&rsquo;s really a bit of a pain to remember to bring my phone to the bathroom, unlock the phone, start the app, then start brushing every time. While you&rsquo;re brushing the app pretty much gives you the same info that you get with the smart guide that Oral B has included with their toothbrushes for a while now (although it does also include news headlines, weather information, and upcoming calendar appointments) but frankly,when I first got my triumph brush I think I used the smart guide for all of about a week and then managed to lose it in the back of a bathroom cabinet, so I&rsquo;m not sure I really see myself continuing to open up the app every time I brush my teeth.The app will also record how often and how long you brush for and the brush will retain 20 sessions if you don&rsquo;t start the app each time you brush, so if you want a log of your brushing habits, then it would be good for this and you&rsquo;d only have to sync with your phone about every two weeks or so, but frankly, I&rsquo;m not entirely certain why I&rsquo;d want a log of how often I brush my teeth.The other thing worth noting is that it doesn&rsquo;t work well to share the brush with someone else. The brush will sync with more than one phone, so if everyone remembers to open the app every time they brush, then it will work and the data will all be logged correctly for each user. However, if you don&rsquo;t open the app the brush will store the session in it&rsquo;s own memory and will then sync that session with the first phone that it connects to. So if my wife wakes up first and brushes her teeth without connecting her phone, then I connect my phone and start brushing the app will show that I brushed my teeth twice that morning&hellip; once from the saved session that my wife did and once from when I actually brushed them.So in the end I&rsquo;m going to keep the brush as I&rsquo;m really quite happy with it&rsquo;s performance as an electric toothbrush, and the bluetooth feature doesn&rsquo;t really add any additional cost (I believe it&rsquo;s actually the same price as the non-bluetooth Pro 5000), but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll actually be using the bluetooth feature several weeks from now.</p>
