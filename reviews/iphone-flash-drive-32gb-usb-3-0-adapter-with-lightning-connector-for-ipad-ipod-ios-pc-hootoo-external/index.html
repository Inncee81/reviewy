<h5 id="but-has-always-wished-there-was-a-better-way-to-transport-pieces-of-information-back-and-forth">but has always wished there was a better way to transport pieces of information back and forth &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this as a present for my husband recently. He is an Apple junkie, but has always wished there was a better way to transport pieces of information back and forth without having to always hook up his phone to his desktop computer, where he syncs his iPhone. So far, he is very pleased with this product. It was very easy to install, with a plug and play modality. He likes that he can transfer information directly from one iPhone to another, without having to go through either a computer or email, or something. There is also a nice, large capacity, which allows him to keep music or other external files handy to use through his iPhone only when needed. Overall, this was a great present to give him!Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verified Purchase&rdquo; indicator shows that this review matches an actual product ordered and delivered from Amazon.I have been working recently to try to write detailed reviews based on my actual experience with these products, as a wife and mom in her late 30’s. If you have found this review helpful, I’d love if you’d indicate that below. This would help me greatly to know if I am making a difference with the effort to write better reviews, and be a better member of the Amazon community of buyers.</p>

<h5 id="very-easy-way-to-transfer-files-extend-your-ipad-iphone-storage-very-easy-backup-of-ipad-iphone">Very easy way to transfer files, extend your ipad / iphone storage, very easy backup of ipad / iphone !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to start with familiar territory and plugged the flash drive into my laptop via USB. The user guide / instruction manual is pre-loaded at the top directory.I created a new folder on the flash drive and loaded a sampling of files that I wanted to try out on my ipad:An MS word document, an MS excel spreadsheet, an adobe PDF, a text file, several songs in several formats, and several pictures and videos in several formats..wma, .mp3, .png, .jpg, .wmv, .movI removed from laptop and plugged into my ipad via lightning connector. The first time you plug in - a message asks to download the iPlugmate app from the app store.Once downloaded, I ran the app.status at bottom: internal storage (ipad) used vs. avl - total near 56gb, external storage (flash drive) used vs. avl - total near 30gbat top, icons for: photos, videos, music, backup, file/folder, systemphotos - both .png and .jpg workvideos - both .mov and .wmv work. A little delay on the .mov, but the .wmv looked and sounded amazingmusic - the .mp3 sounded great. .wma does not work native on ios as expected, but an app called &ldquo;oplayer lite&rdquo; will work. I transfered the file from the flash drive to my ipad - it played and sounded great !!!file/folder - allows navigation through whatever files and folders you have created on the flash drive. I navigated to my other files &hellip;MS word - display is very clearMS excel - allowed display of multiple tabs !!!adobe PDF - display is very cleartext file - display is very clear*** In here you can also access the ipad foldersphotos, music, videos, documentsphotos: camera roll, photogrid- very easy way to get all these items on the ipad in one place*** Tap on the wrench icon. This will allow you to select, rename, copy/cut/paste files. Using the simple method of copying files from the flash drive, I was able to paste them to the ipad !!! Easy to copy either direction*** Can review transfer history, tap on transfer icon.backup - very easy to use. Backup all files - photos, videos, music, documents, app install files and contacts to the thumb drive- it places everything in seperate folderssystem- you can adjust the cache size (512mb, 1gb, 2gb)*** I have mine at 512mb. If you are transfering larger files, a higher cache size will use more device memory and speed up transfer.- you can select the language (there are 7 choices)&mdash; NOW &mdash;After I completed the testing on the ipad, I did the same on my iphone. There were no differences at all functionality wise !!!*** small challenge - I had to remove my phone case to plug in the flash drive.My final step was to unplug the flash drive from the iphone and plug into my laptop.This was a very easy way to transfer files, photos from ipad / iphone to laptop.Customer support is a phone call or email away if the user guide is not enough. This is another quality product from HooToo.I purchased at a discount in exchange for an honest and thorough review. I always give an honest review regardless of my own purchase or not.I hope this provides some helpful information and would appreciate the click on Yes !!!</p>

<p>Apple can be STUBBORN! They refuse to give us expandable memory. This just makes it supremely difficult to manage data when on the road. Do I want to use my data plan to upload pictures and media files while on vacation?! NO! That;s why I got the HooToo USB 3.09 Flash Drive with Lightning connected. I bet Apple HATES this accessory. Because it saves money! This is a Flash Drive with 32 GB of storage and a fast 3.0 USB connector on one end and a fast Lightning Connector on the other end. To use on your Lightning port equipped devices like the iPhone 6. This small device has a great feature in that the protective caps are attached with a strong but tiny flexible plastic cable to prevent misplacing the unit. It feels very solidly made, it&rsquo;s compact, and super light! It&rsquo;s part of my accessory bag and I take it everywhere.You will want to download the iPlugmate App from the IOS App store. When I first got it I just plug it in to my iPad and it prompt me that I don’t have iPlugmate apps and was ask if I want to download it from Apps store then I click “yes” and download the app.This app will make transferring or using Videos, Photos, Music and more very simple.It is very fast and easy to use and will provide plenty of storage for backups. It works with Fat32 files!!! You can watch videos stored on the drive! Wow! Not every drive can handle the Fat32 files. The HooToo can!With iPad, iPhone and iPod usually you connect to PC or Mac to sync your music, photos, video and other media files but having this 32 GB flash drive you can easily grab your files from your PC and MAC with fast data transfer too and then just plugged in this to our iOS device and you have the files instantly. This saves me a lot of time doing file transferring and mostly my favorite TV shows so I can watch it on my iPad. Particularly helpful on LONG FLIGHTS without good Wi-Fi. I have also found it helpful on long car rides and on camping trips. This allows me to travel light, travel right, and keep connected.I was given a free sample for my unbiased review. [&hellip;]! Thanks!</p>

<p>I bought the Hoo Too to watch movies on my iPad when I travel. I&rsquo;m here to tell you that it works great for that. I connect the USB end of the Hoo Too to my MacBook Pro and then transfer my mp4 video files from the laptop to the Hoo Too. Then, connect the Hoo Too to the iPad, using the Lighting connector. Open the iPlugmate app (free download from the App Store), find the movie file on the Hoo Too, double click the file, and the movie streams flawlessly without using precious space on the iPad. It will play most video files. You can also use it as you would any Flash Drive to store, and share, photos, video and documents.</p>
