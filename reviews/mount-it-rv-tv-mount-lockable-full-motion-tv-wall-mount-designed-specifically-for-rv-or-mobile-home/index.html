<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-great-in-the-rv">Works great in the RV!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount works great in our RV! Holds a 24&rdquo; LED AC/DC HD TV with built in DVD. We can watch TV from the bed or turn it 180 degrees and watch it from the dinette. Just enough vertical adjustment. Holds solidly in place. We leave the two outer adjustments locked in place so all we have to do is swivel it in or out for viewing. We also bought this from Amazon to hold the TV in place during travel.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJ6OCTS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJ6OCTS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-an-rv">Great for an RV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great mount for an RV the knobs need to be tight for travel but the included wrench helps for that there are cap screws in the middle of the knobs winch help to give it that extra oomph to stay tight. The additional mounting bracket is great it makes moving the single TV around much easier. Installing was easy it went on interior walls and I was able to mount it into a stud in the wall and it will not move. The TV that is mounted to it is only a 24&rdquo; it it is relatively light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tv-mount">Great TV mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install, works perfectly in our RV under storage where we wanted to mount our TV. Easy to lock and it stays put! It was exactly what we needed and it was a great price. I would highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-my-purchase">Very happy with my purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount is great for mobile applications. The various adjustments have detent&rsquo;s so that when you tighten the mount it is held firmly in place. I will see how it holds up over time, but quality seems good out of the package, and even comes with a second mounting plate so you can move the TV to another part of the cabin if you would like.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-versatile-and-well-designed-tv-mount">A versatile and well-designed TV mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this to mount a 39-inch TV, weighing 15 pounds, in an RV. I wanted to b able to lock the TV at whatever orientation we needed to be able to view it easily from the couch. This item filled the bill completely. It extends some 14 inches or so from the mounting point. In addition, there are three joints that allow swiveling in the horizontal plane. A fourth joint allows tilting the TV in the vertical plane. Each joint has teeth that can then be locked down by turning a knob at each joint. I had to mount this TV so that it sits in front of and up against the front of the original TV&rsquo;s cabinet. So, that the mount is set about six inches within the cabinet. The only problem I have is that when I have to stow it, I just loosen the pivots and then push the TV flat against the cabinet. The result is that once the TV is in its stowed position, I cannot access the knobs to tighten and secure the TV in its stowed position, when it&rsquo;s time to go on the road again. I will probably have to devise some sort of strap that can be secured from outside of, and in front of the TV. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a very good TV mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-rating-would-be-five-if-the-tightening-knobs-were">My rating would be five if the tightening knobs were &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My rating would be five if the tightening knobs were a little larger in diameter. The mount was used in an RV and needed to be tight with just finger tips. It just keeps getting loose!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed-for-my-travel-trailer">Just what I needed for my travel trailer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked perfectly in our travel trailer for mounting a TV in the bedroom. Stayed in position when traveling without any issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="needs-larger-teeth-or-tighter-locks">Needs larger teeth or tighter locks&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept is great, but I believe it needs larger teeth to bite and hold securely. On a couple of occasions while driving on winding roads, the swivel comes loose and the 20 inch TV swings freely. I tried using lock washers. It helped, but I cannot trust this 100%.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea-very-happy-to-finally-find-this-item">Great idea. Very happy to finally find this item.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We searched everywhere around town for something like this but couldn&rsquo;t find it.My husband installed it in our camper trailer and it works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. Easy to mount and makes TV easy to view</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Product. Great deal!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very flimsy! Tv moves all around. Constantly falls forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="has-held-well">Has held well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed on my boat for a 40&rdquo; tv and it has held for a year and during some serious wave pounding!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-for-our-rv">Worked great for our RV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for our RV, screws were just right length not to pop out the wall on the other side! Very sturdy</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-product-seems-like-it-would-be-good-but-a-defect-in-one">the product seems like it would be good but a defect in one &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the product seems like it would be good but a defect in one of the joints renders it unusable. I&rsquo;ve seen positive reviews so I&rsquo;m assuming it was just a problem with my item, but&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Affixed to camper wall and it works great. Holds a 32&rdquo; flatscreen like a dream. Up down left right..choose your angle it holds it tight! Two thumbs up!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="never-moves-and-love-how-many-ways-you-have-to-set-it-exactly">Never moves and love how many ways you have to set it exactly &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We mounted this on our boat with a 27&rdquo; flat screen and it works perfectly. Never moves and love how many ways you have to set it exactly the way you want the tv to be&hellip;</p>
