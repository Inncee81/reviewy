<p>World-class optics
7.1x Zoom plus fast f/2 max aperture lens yields incredible results
Every COOLPIX camera is built around a genuine NIKKOR glass lens, the lens in the COOLPIX P7800 is no exception. It has an f/2 maximum aperture—pros call it a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; lens, you&rsquo;ll call it incredible. Create photos and videos with tack sharp subjects against beautifully blurred backgrounds, and shoot without a flash in situations you wouldn&rsquo;t think possible. It has a 7.1x wide-angle to telephoto zoom range—capture 180°/360° panoramas as easily as detailed close-ups. You even can get as close as 0.8-inches from your subject for exciting macro shots. And with lens-shift Vibration Reduction (VR), you never have to worry about a little camera shake ruining a shot.</p>

<p>Superior low-light performance

You won&rsquo;t have to interrupt a moment to capture it, and your photos and HD videos will look more natural and true to your memory. The COOLPIX P7800 performs so well in low light situations that, in most cases, using the flash is optional. Of course, when the lighting is extremely poor and you need a flash, it&rsquo;ll be there.</p>

Find exciting new perspectives by swiveling out the Vari-angle display and moving the camera around—raise it overhead or move it to ground-level for suprirsing new views. When conditions require, use the bright 921,000-dot Electronic Eye-Level viewfinder and frame exactly the shot you want.</p>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-wanted-for-a-small-portable-camera-with-features">Exactly what I wanted for a small portable camera with features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for an alternative to having to alway pack my DSLR, lenses, flash units and so forth. I looked at this camera (Nikon CoolPix P7800) versus the Nikon 1 Series and decided on this one based on the following:1. Retractable lens for convenience in packing - lens has effective focal length 28-200mm 35mm equivalent.2. Lens opens to f 2.0 at wide angle, and to f 4.0 at telephoto - a very fast lens for this class of camera.3. Close focusing macro range less than 1 inch at wide angle.4. Built in pop-up flash - also has shoe compatible with all of other Nikon flash units (700, 800, 900)5. Ability to switch from LCD screen to viewfinder screen with a button push for difficult lighting situations.6. The LCD screen is very useful given its ability to rotate for various viewing angles.After I got the camera, I found there were a few limitations to the focus mode, but once you get used to them, it is acceptable. There is an AF mode that focuses at distances more than about 18 inches, a macro focus mode that focuses at very close distances under 4-6 inches, and a mode for focusing in between. The access to the focus modes is convenient and obviously located on the dial on the back of the camera, so I did not find this difficult to adapt to. You have to remember to reset the focus mode when you turn the camera on for the types of shots you want to take.I tried other special features, such as in camera special effects and panoramic stitching. I was especially satisfied with the black and white special effects which gave some interesting high contrast black and white results. It is not my intent to reproduce the information which can be found at the NIkon site, just share my impressions. One feature which really made me happy was the setting that allows me to put the camera into auto iso mode, but restrict the lower and upper range settings. I keep the camera in auto iso 80-800, even thought it can range up to 1600 (3200 in hi iso). The noise of the sensor is quite acceptable in this range (80-800).I bought the additional wifi adapter which allows remote control with a cell phone. Overall, the ability to view, zoom and activate the shutter are acceptable, and would probably be great with the camera on a tripod located many feet away for capturing wildlife. The remote functions are fairly limited, but more than I expected.Features change depending on the setting you are working in, and you have to get used to it. Mostly I shoot in Aperture preferred or Program mode, but all of the options and menus are context sensitive to the mode you are in.Focusing is no slower than you would expect from an electronic point and shoot, but to be sure, this is nowhere near the capabilities of a DSLR. One feature I found very easy and useful to use is it is trivial to set the camera for multiple exposures (-1, 0, +1) and get 3 quick exposures of the same image. Images can be shot in jpg, jpg + raw or raw. As with all new raw formats, I am waiting for Adobe to catch up with this raw format, so all of my observations are based on jpg files.I look forward to taking this with me on my next trip. The size is great, the price is reasonable for this set of features, and there are enough advantages to use this when you want to avoid the buld of your DSLR. I can recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="the-camera-i-need">The camera I need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An early review after using this camera for a couple of hours. This jacket-pocketable camera makes good images, gives you control over crafting your photos, and is ergonomically comfortable to use. Despite the fact that I generally stay away from gimicky scene modes, I was surprised to find a couple of them appealing, including the different options for for panoramas and the color-selective filters. So far, so good.Let&rsquo;s get my biases out. I have Nikon gear (a couple of SLRs) and I would prefer to have my camera work well with existing remotes, flashes, and my old P7000 batteries. I also like that the camera menus are familiar for a Nikon user and I have a good sense how the Active-D lighting, TTL flash exposure, and general focusing modes work. For me, quick comprehension and intuitive use of these controls greatly increases the cameras performance. I also prefer diopter-adjustable viewfinders due to superior performance in bright light and the fact that with bifocals, focusing on the camera screen can literally be a pain in the neck.I am very pleased with the electronic viewfinder as it shows in the viewfinder the setting changes as you go, just like on the back screen. I found myself rapidly adjusting settings without looking, being confident that I was getting it right. The colors in the viewfinder aren&rsquo;t perfect, but it provides more than enough resolution to thoughtfully compose images. I found the manual focus very easy to use compared to other compact-ish cameras I&rsquo;ve tried, especially since it can all be done through the viewfinder.I like that the P7800 has a real lens cap, real camera heft, and real controls. Image quality is good in typical indoor lighting scenes without a flash and great outside in good light. My guess is that there those pixel peepers who will take issue with some of the performance in marginal light conditions, and if that is what you care about, you can study the reference photos of toy soldiers, books, coins, feathers, and color charts at other sites.I&rsquo;m still learning the benefits of the articulating screen, but one that I see immediately is that it can be stowed away when not in use, protecting it from sometimes rough treatment and the smudges from my nose when using the viewfinder.It&rsquo;s not the snappiest camera recording images, but once on, its responsive to the shutter release (the area of performance I value). It just takes a while to write. It is faster than my P7000 (though heftier), but nowhere near as fast as my D90. It allows me to get the shots I need when I need them, except for the most demanding conditions (really low light where you need high ISO&rsquo;s, rapidfire sports shooting, serious macro shooting&ndash;although the macro focus functions work pretty well).I got this camera to have at all times in my work bag as a daily-use camera so that I won&rsquo;t miss images when traveling for work, commuting, or running errands without the bulk of my SLR. With its viewfinder, good image quality, jacket-pocketable size, ease and familiarity in its use, it is the camera I need.Would I like to have the larger sensor and better ISO performance in it? yes. Would I like it to be smaller? yes. Would I like it to be cheaper? Sure (I could have gotten the P7700 if I didn&rsquo;t prefer viewfinders). But in the overall compromise of wants for a relatively compact camera, the P7800 is what I need.Update:After having the camera a few weeks, I&rsquo;m very happy with it. I was getting frustrated if you have it on one of the &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; modes or &ldquo;Best Shot Selection&rdquo; and raw photos, as it will take ~10 seconds to digest the photos, but single shots with raw are recorded pretty quickly. The viewfinder and the camera heft and overall design and handling makes for working well in marginal conditions, macro shooting, or generally for just carrying around. I find I&rsquo;m using the button that replaced the dial on top of the P7000 for adjustments more than I used the dial, especially doing it through the viewfinder. Battery life is good when I primarily shoot with the viewfinder, not having to change the battery over the course of a long weekend and 200 shots even with the flash. Like other Nikons, the TTL flash exposure works great, and I used it to drive a SB-600 and -700 flash for a few photos of a family dinner, which came out super. Low light performance is better than I hoped, with ISO 800 working pretty well. Some examples are at my Google+ site, pretty much straight from the camera. [&hellip;] . I found the viewfinder nice at the concert, as it is less obtrusive to snap a shot without having to have a screen lit up.I&rsquo;m very happy to get the performance I get from a jacket pocketable camera.</p>
