<h5 id="these-are-great-for-use-during-work-outs-but-also-just-wearing">These are great for use during work outs but also just wearing &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great for use during work outs but also just wearing at home or hiking. It is only 6 pounds of extra weight but it feels like 20 after a couple of hours! I use them specifically to target an ankle injury and the extra weight actually helps balance and support. What I don&rsquo;t like about the design of this ankle weight and most other ankle weights is, the actual cushioned weight part goes only partially around even a small ankle. Which leaves a good 3 or 4 inches of your ankle exposed to the constant scraping of the velcro strap. Ouch. There are other companies that make ankle weights that are about 4 inches longer that do not do this, but these are overall okay for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-very-comfortable-and-easy-to-put-on-and-take-off">They are very comfortable, and easy to put on and take off</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are just as described. They are very comfortable, and easy to put on and take off, and there is plenty of room for adjustment. The carry bag keeps them neat and easy to carry. I use them as ankle weights in rehab for a knee replacement. The fact that they are guaranteed decided me on them, and they do seem to be high quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="gets-the-job-done-nicely">Gets the Job Done Nicely</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this set for knee replacement rehab. The 3 lb. (6 lb. total) set is good to use in several applications of the workout. Applicable for upper body when used on wrists. Very well made. The Velcro and latch buckle keep the weights securely on. The trim is reflective for night use. The company&rsquo;s literature includes very supportive info. Proper adjustment of any exposed skin via socks, etc., will get rid of Velcro rub being a problem. Got this set on sale, hence excellent quality for a nice price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love">Love!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these are really good, I got them to give me a bit of extra workout when I play with Wii Gold&rsquo;s Gym Boxing, with all the punching I was doing, they stayed secured to my wrists and gave my arms and upper body a really good work out I am glad I got them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-product-and-good-value">Quality product and good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality product. , Had a knee replacement and needed a set of ankle weights to help with the rehab, these fit the bill perfectly. Comfortable, good hook and loop attachments. Really helped with the straightening exercises.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="of-good-quality-material-and-functionality-is-as-you-d-expect">of good quality material and functionality is as you&rsquo;d expect</h5>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Do the ankle/wrist weights fit the description and appearance in the listing?Yes, the product fits the description and appearance in the listing.2. How is the quality and functionality?It feels, generally, of good quality material and functionality is as you&rsquo;d expect.3. Where and how did you use them?I bought two pairs, and wear them around my apartment on my ankles and wrists. I do this for the purpose of developing and strengthening my bio-mechanical movement. Of note here is that I have some experience with bio-mechanics, and my partner has 10+ years experience in bodily movement (so the process is one of processing and progressive development).4. Other, personal points:I would recommend these for anyone wishing to develop the smaller muscles in the hip and shoulder girdles. My experience with them, and development in my training since using them, tells me that the product compliments and good training program (providing nutrition and other factors are in line).Cheers to Nordic Lifting for the assist in my training.</li>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy Customer!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I seriously LOVE these!! I can even just wear them around the house and workout my legs and arms. It is so simple. They are very comfortable, to the point that I even wear them out of the house under my jeans when I go to the store (just for that extra burn in my legs). I&rsquo;m a single mom and don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to workout, but these are showing improvement after just using them daily for a week. Great investment.</p>
</blockquote>
