<h5 id="bravo-taotronics">Bravo TaoTronics</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unbelievable that there is intelligence in this world. How many salesman and their dumbfounded faces like at Best Buy saying I would like my TV to transmit a Bluetooth signal so my Bluetooth devices could receive it like headphones and speakers only to be told Gee Sir they just don&rsquo;t make one for that application. Product knowledge what has happened to that. I tip my hat to you TaoTronics excellent product. I could sell a million of these marketed right. Smart TVS do not have Bluetooth cars, cellphones you name it. Would be nice to have this for wireless transmitting to audio devices. For the price and how quick it connects it is a no brainer to any HDTV owner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bluetooth-transmitter">Great bluetooth transmitter.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This transmitter works precisely as advertised. I have the device hooked up to my smart TV via the included USB and audio cables.Pairing my LG bluetooth headphones was a breeze. While my headphones were in pairing mode, I simply held down the button on the transmitter for a few seconds and watched it quickly force pair.The range is excellent and I&rsquo;ve had zero audio hickups of any kind.I&rsquo;m honestly quite impressed. Especially for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-bluetooth-transmitter">Excellent Bluetooth Transmitter!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the TT-BA06 Bluetooth stereo transmitter for over a month now, and everything about it is great! They call it High-Fidelity and it absolutely is. If you like to listen to music you will appreciate this elegant transmitter.I say elegant because of it&rsquo;s smooth ergonomic design, simple ease of use and great sound.You can add Hi-Fi stereo Bluetooth to any device with an audio out jack. It is the best one I&rsquo;ve used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-little-transmitter">Awesome little transmitter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome little transmitter! This thing paired easily with our Sony Bluetooth speaker and sounds great hooked up to my laptop headphone jack or to our TV using the included RCA cable set. With the long life rechargeable battery and the ability to transmit audio from almost any device, the only problem I see is not losing the 1-<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; x 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; x <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; transmitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-what-i-bought-it-for-yay">Does what I bought it for&hellip;YAY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this so far&hellip;.the test is always time. I have a really old iPod that had to be connected to a jack to be heard. Now I can leave my iPod in one place in my apartment, or put it in my bag if I am on the bus or out walking. My only problem was that I couldn&rsquo;t get it to pair. I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it. Then I put it right up next to the ear piece during pairing and it immediately paired. I think this is important because it wasn&rsquo;t in the same area it was within an inch before it happened. Then I was happy. So if anyone is having trouble, try putting really close before you decide it&rsquo;s not working.</p>

<h5 id="taotronics-bluetooth-transmitter-and-headset-from-sunvalleytek-amazon-com-great-product-and-customer-service">Taotronics bluetooth transmitter and headset from Sunvalleytek/amazon.com, great product and customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend the Taotronics bluetooth transmitter (TT-BA06) and bluetooth headset (TT-BHO7)from Amazon.com and Sunvalleytek. Everything works and the customer response has been absolutelyoutstanding.I purchased a Taotronics bluetooth transmitter (TT-BA06) to connect to the audio output of myTV along with a Taotronics bluetooth earbud headset (TT-BH07) so that I could hear the TV withoutturning up the volume to the point that it bothered anyone else watching TV. I purchased these onAmazon.com from Sunvalleytek. They arrived promptly by UPS and were easy to connect with wellwritten instructions emailed to me from Sunvalleytek (the instruction manual from Taotronics was&rdquo;minimal&rdquo; to say the least).The Taotronics transmitter and earbud headset are just what I had hoped for. I have difficultypicking up the dialog on TV movies due to a high frequency hearing loss,. With the Taotronicsbluetooth transmitter and receiver I can now watch the TV and control the volume to the earbudswith the inline controller on the earbuds independent of the volume setting for the TV. For meand for my family this is the perfect solution to a modest loss of hearing.I was able to get them to &ldquo;pair&rdquo; very easily with the small transmitter plugged into the TV.I was even able to get them to pair with the transmitter plugged into the audio output of my MP3player and PC. However when I plugged the transmitter into the audio output of the iPhone I wasunable to pair them. I have some music stored on my iPhone that I like to listen to and I frequentlylisten to internet radio on my iPhone. I did not expect this to work nor was I too disappointedbecause the primary reason for my purchase was for listening to the TV and this was workingperfectly. However I emailed Sunvalleytek to see if I was expecting too much. The response fromSunvalleytek was phenomenal! Alisa (Taotronics customer care) answered my email the next morningwith well written and detailed instructions for resetting the headset (a matter of holding downthe + and - volume buttons on the very small inline headset controller). This worked fine.But then I tried to pair my headset after turning on the iPhone bluetooth (not using theTaotronics transmitter). I could not make this work either. After another email exchange withAlisa, and with the instructions originally emailed with the purchase from Sunvalleytak, I amnow able to listen to music and internet radio with my iPhone and just the bluetooth headset.For me this was a bonus.The story is not over because a problem developed pairing with the transmitter connected to theTV. I felt defeated and asked about an exchange. I was assured that they would send me anothertransmitter but they suggested first that a transmitter reset might resolve the problem. Withanother set of well written simple instructions for button pushes on the transmitter from Alisa, allproblems resolved themselves. I was completely satisfied with everything.But one more thing&hellip; I did not even know that the headset, with the tiny online contoller, includeda microphone so that I could use the headset with my iPhone and talk over the telephone wearingjust the bluetooth headset. This works too and it is wonderful. I got way more than I knew! What adelight.I have now used the Taotronics bluetooth transmitter and headset for almost a week. My experiencewith Sunvalleytek has been way more than I would ever have hoped for, they get an A+.Thank you, Alisa and Sunvalleytek, for our patience and very helpful and prompt email responses,jrmaxwel@umich.edu</p>

<h5 id="high-audio-quality-great-choice">High Audio Quality - Great Choice.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Clear as a bell. We&rsquo;d gotten a transmitter from Best Buy which made us crazy as the sound quality was way below what our Bose bluetooth headphones are capable of, A little research told us we needed a Bluetooth 4.0 transmitter, which is what this is and so we ordered this unit. Sound quality is excellent, and the range, as promised, is significantly higher than our previous unit. It did take a few tries to pair with the Bose headphones, but once it found them it&rsquo;s been great.</p>
