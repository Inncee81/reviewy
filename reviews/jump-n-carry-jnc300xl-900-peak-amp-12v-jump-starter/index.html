<h5 id="jump-n-carry">Jump-N-Carry</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Carry&rdquo; part of Jump-N-Carry is slightly misleading because this beast is heavy! I am a big guy standing 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; at 240 pounds and carrying this thing around is a workout. I leave it in my car&rsquo;s trunk and I have used this so many times since December 2009 when I bought it that I have lost count.I originally purchased this for emergency use in case my battery dies or a tire goes flat. For that purpose, I have used it many times, both to jump-start my car when the battery died and to fill my car and motorcycle tires with air when they start to get low. Just having it available for these tasks makes it completely worth what I had paid for it. However, by far the most number of times I have used this is to help a stranger in need.Whenever I drive by and see someone staring dumbly at their car with the hood up, I stop and ask if they need any help. More often than not, they just need a jump-start. Out comes my Jump-N-Carry and within just a few seconds, their vehicle is running again. It is as simple as placing it near their vehicle, putting the red cable on their positive connector, black cable on their negative connector and telling them to start the vehicle. Every time, the vehicle had started instantly&ndash;no hesitation. I once had to use the jump-starter three times in a single day without needing to charge it. I am very impressed with its performance.There are smaller and lighter ones out there, but if you need something you can depend on, this beast of a jump-starter will not disappoint you.</p>

<h5 id="defective-right-out-of-the-box-be-careful-what-you-buy">Defective right out of the box: Be careful what you buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking to purchase a new Jump pack for use in the shop and narrowed my selection down to either the Clore JNC660 or the Shumacker ProSeries DSR PSJ-2212The reviews were about equal on both so I decided to get the JNC660Well, I just received the JNC660 today and it is defective right out of the box.I plugged it in to charge and the amber led that is suppose to be lit does not indicate it is charging. The Green LED does not show it is fully charged either.I verified my power cord has power from the outlet; even switched to another cord.Disappointed; I guess companies no longer have QC on their products.UPDATE: Feb 04, 2014After realizing that Amazon will not accept returns on this item, I contacted Clore Automotive tech support and explained that I had received a defective jump pack. I reviewed with them the various items I had checked to confirm that it was indeed defective.After they confirmed that I had purchased it via Amazon, they shipped a new JNC660 to me along with a prepaid UPS label to return to them the defective unit. I had the replacement unit in 5 days after contacting them. The replacement unit works great.Clore Automotive gets 5 stars from me for making this disappointing defective unit right.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-jumper-cables">Better than jumper cables!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently bought a 2008 Mustang. Had a cold front come through and the battery died. I jumped it off and drove to Interstate Battery and had it replaced. Vehicle sat for a week and again wouldn&rsquo;t power anything. The battery was 2.x volts. I searched Amazon and came across this product. I read many comments and ordered one received it, charged overnight, then connected to Mustangs battery. Cranked and started within a couple of seconds.Wonderful product for less than $70! Recommend this over a very good set of jumper cables&hellip;you do NOT need another vehicle! Sometimes you&rsquo;re not parked in a conveniences location to make it easy to connect to another&rsquo;s vehicle battery.With this device you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. I had to use again a few days later. I pulled it out of the trunk, hooked it up and started it.I did discover what&rsquo;s draining the battery. When Interstate connected the new battery they connected pos side. Then he put neg side on then removed it. Caused CD changer to jam with CD inside. When vehicle off the CD changer periodically tries to operate, draining the battery over about 5-6 days. They should have used a keep-alive while replacing the battery. This is a common problem with Ford Shaker CD changers, I&rsquo;ve discovered. And the CD changer is no longer any good.Only problem I see happening is trying to remember to charge up the unit every 3-4 months. But they have an email service you can sign up for that&rsquo;s free.</p>

<h5 id="rugged-well-built-and-plenty-of-power">Rugged, well built and plenty of power.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 2005 Hummer H2 and for some reason if I let it sit for a few days the battery will drain, I suspect there is some component that stays on like my Kenwood GPS that slowly drains the battery, Also if I leave the key in the ignition with the radio on for 10 minutes the battery will die. May need a new battery, anyway I needed something that would turn this 6.0 litre engine over reliably when such an event occurred. This unit came in on time and has worked three times so far, easily turning over the engine in the H2. It came fully charged and I have not recharged it yet. The build quality is definitely pro grade, rugged and well built, the cables are thick but pliable and it stows exceedingly well. I couldn&rsquo;t be more happy with this unit.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-best-unit-to-buy">This is the BEST unit to Buy!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am in my sixty&rsquo;s so I have been around the block more than once. I have worked all around the United States and seen many things that are suppose to work, as you know many do not do what they claim.I have worked on farms, ranches, logging, construction, semi-truck driver, and until I had saw this with my own eyes: never thought there was anything out there that would do the job. I have a 1999 Holiday Rambler 37&rsquo; diesel motorhome. It will pull itself and car on steel trailer up mountains like it is not hooked on anything. Yet, when the batteries are DEAD, you cannot just jump it with another car.We have over the years started it with a lot of different units. When we had to this last time, it was started up when one of these units was hooked up to it right off. It had not ran for 4 days before and I had run the batteries down trying to start it. This is why I bought this unit. It started the house side up right after it started the big diesel engine too!We are very happy with this unit! It is by far the BEST there is out there and I would LOOK no further if I was going to think about purchasing another one. This is like I say is THE BEST UNIT OUT THERE, BAR NONE!</p>
