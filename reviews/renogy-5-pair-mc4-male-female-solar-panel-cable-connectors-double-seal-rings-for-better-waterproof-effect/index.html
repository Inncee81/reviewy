<h5 id="the-best-connector-for-solar-panels-with-10-gauge-single-conductor-wires">The best connector for Solar Panels with 10 gauge single conductor wires/</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well. This is a newer design that I didn&rsquo;t like originally. But after some use, I decided I like it better than the older devices because they are simpler.I recommend you fill in the interior with dielectric grease.Also, the crimp is fairly important. Use a good crimp tool and discard the core of the connector if you screw up the crimp. I messed up a few the first time I made one of these up.I also recommend you make sure you have extra connectors. Don&rsquo;t buy exactly the number you need. Be sure you have extra&rsquo;s.Finally, study the male and female versions and take care to install the right parts on the wires you need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-ordered-imagine-that">Exactly what I ordered, imagine that.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed to alter the lengths of my cable for the solar panels I installed on my RV and these fit the Mc4 10 awg cable perfectly. No instructions came with them but I figured it out. If you are running solar and using Mc4 cable these fit the bill. They are all plastic with O ring seals and you have to crimp the wires (I soldered mine in in place because I didn&rsquo;t buy the pricy crimping tool). All said and done I am happy with them. We will see how they hold up after a year in the sun on the roof of my RV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-mc4-connectors-unless-needed-for-use-with-amphenol-connectors">best mc4 Connectors unless needed for use with amphenol connectors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very high quality! I tried all of the cheaper connectors available here on Amazon, and at times was severely disappointed in their quality. I had connectors melt together, and some not make contact at all. These make very good contact and are easy to work with. Don&rsquo;t mate up perfectly with amphenol connectors on my solar panels. The male connectors don&rsquo;t make the best contact. Other than that, far better than any of the cheaper mc4 connectors on Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-then-the-whole-assembly-won-t-fit-into-the-connector-body-without-using-great-force-i-felt-like-i-was-doing-something">and then the whole assembly won&rsquo;t fit into the connector body without using great force. I felt like I was doing something &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had previously ordered a Renogy 100W kit which comes with connection wire. So I ordered some of these in case I needed them, which I did. They don&rsquo;t really fit the Renogy wire all that well. Specifically there is a round rubber-like collar and round plastic strain relief that fits over the rubber collar, all of which goes into the connector body and under the screw-on cap. When the rubber collar is pushed over the wire&rsquo;s insulation, it expands to the point where the plastic strain relief won&rsquo;t fit over it, and then the whole assembly won&rsquo;t fit into the connector body without using great force. I felt like I was doing something wrong &ndash; perhaps I was, but I&rsquo;ll never know b/c (a) absolutely no instructions whatsoever come with these connectors &ndash; just a bunch of loose parts in a bag and (b) no help at all from the Renogy YouTube on this topic &ndash; the video doesn&rsquo;t show the steps involving the rubber collar and strain relief items. Including some instructions on a slip of paper enclosed in the bag would have cost you practically nothing and would have made my experience a lot better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-connector">Good quality connector.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Connectors appears to be good quality. The metal contacts appears to be copper coated with tin. For 12v with 5A to 10A, these connectors are perfect. They fit my Solar Panel with no issues. Easy attach and removal.Note that these work better with 12GA wires. 14GA wires would be the minimum. The crimping and how the connector casing clamps on the wire shielding will not work properly with smaller Gauge wires.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-connectors-multi-o-ring-sealed">Good connectors. Multi &ldquo;O&rdquo; ring sealed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice connectors. Multi &ldquo;O&rdquo; ring sealed. Simple dbl clip design. (Get the tool), way easier on your fingers. Note, these connectors will NOT fit 8 AWG cable, the sheilding is just too thick. Great for #10, which is what comes on most factory panels. Note that 5 come in a bag. You can either look at that as 1 extra for screw ups, or buy the extra bag to have an even number. Either way, a good marketing ploy. Kinda like the uneven amount of hot dog buns and franks in a pack. Hmmm. Anyway, good quality. Really speeds up the job and keeps everything clean, dry and professional.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="first-time-solar-diyer-and-these-worked-out-well">First time solar DIYer and these worked out well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I crimped and soldered short 10 awg that allowed me to enter the camper via the roof, while maintaining plug connections. By the way, what looks like the male as far as the plastic piece is concerned actually the female and what looks like female is the male. Kind of tricky and I wasted one piece, but I only needed three anyway. A couple of tips: make sure your polarity is correct and make sure the little &ldquo;gripper&rdquo; piece that squeezes the wire when you twist on the cap goes together properly. The price was good and delivery was quick. I recommend these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality">High quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These appear to be the real deal of high quality. Mine have an o-ring where the connectors mate together and an elastomeric bushing around the wire entry that squeezes down when you tighten the &ldquo;backshell&rdquo;. It looks like they would make a weatherproof connection as long as your wire is snug through the bushing. (I had to wrap a couple turns of self-vulcanizing rubber tape around 16 ga. wires to fill the radial gap.) The contacts seem suitable for 30 amps and both the pin and socket are protected from accidental contact even when un-mated. Study these a bit before you insert a contact into a barrel &ndash;it is possible to insert the pin where the socket should be or vice-versa. Once they are inserted, I don&rsquo;t think they can be extracted if you made a mistake. Also, I don&rsquo;t understand why this seller sells this kit with an odd number (5) of mating pairs, since you would almost always use two mated pairs together (one pair for the positive and one for the return).</p>

<h5 id="not-a-good-quality-mc4">Not a good quality MC4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not a good quality MC4. The male pin moves around inside the connector body. They do not fit the standard MC4 tool. Had to buy another brand. I&rsquo;ve installed several PV systems.</p>
