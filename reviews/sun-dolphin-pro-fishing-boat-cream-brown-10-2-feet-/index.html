<h5 id="sun-dolphin-pro-10-2">Sun dolphin pro 10.2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the coolest set ups on a small boat has all of the big boy features it is prewired has front and bow lights A live-well and only weighs 163 pounds fits right into the back of my pick up truck I can easily take this in an out all by myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-boat">Great little boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this boat for almost a year now and absolutely love it. During the spring through early winter, I have put it in various lakes,ponds, and rivers with ease either alone or with a fishing buddy. Most of the time I just keep it in the back of my truck for a quick fishing trip after work. I installed a 6hp motor and a 30lb trolling motor on it as well. Alone the 6hp will plane the boat out nicely travelling at 12mph according to the gps. As far as the water that collects between the floor, its more condensation than anything else. Although water will get between the floor if you hit big enough waves of it left uncovered in a rain storm, water would get in through the seat posts or around the rub rail. Really not a big deal, just pull the plug and elevate the bow for a little and the water will be empty in no time. So again, I love this little boat!!! It has given countless hours of fishing enjoyment as well as just buzzing around having fun. Hope this helps any of you that may be on the fence.</p>

<h5 id="water-quest-basstender-10-2">Water Quest Basstender 10.2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little boat for small areas, such as a small lake or river. I use it on a small river in central Florida. I power it with a 40lb. thrust trolling motor, and it moves it very good. They are trying to eliminate combustion engines on this river so this unit works great. I put the trolling motor on the front so I can see the areas I want to fish easier. It does &ldquo;skid&rdquo; a little like this when I am alone, but when two people are in the boat the control is much better. It has a small livewell, which is perfect for the panfish I catch. The rod holders are nice and use the navigation lite holder for another rod holder since I don&rsquo;t go out at night. The seats are comfortable, and there is adequate room for the gear I take. You can&rsquo;t stand as easily in a bigger boat, but you have to consider the cost. I think I have $1500 total including boat, motor, battery, etc. I use a utility trailer to haul it, but I think it will fit into a pick-up truck.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-boat">I love this boat.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this boat for my son and I to go fishing in. We decided on this boat because of the options that came with the boat, such as the livewell, pre-wired for trolling motor, and comfortable seats. The fact that it fits in the back of my pickup and I don&rsquo;t need a trailer is a bonus. We used this boat a lot this past summer. It&rsquo;s easy to load and unload from the truck and if it is any distants to the launch site can be manuevered on a garden wagon. We power ours with a 4hp gas engine and a 50 pound thrust trolling motor. We use the trolling motor when fishing lakes and the gas motor when fishing in the ocean. We live on the coast of Maine and have taken the boat out to the islands offshore, 1 or 2 miles from the mainland. It runs perfectly even in swells up to 5 feet. It planes easily with the 4hp motor. The best part is that it only holds two people so It gives me plenty of time with my son.</p>

<h5 id="very-comfortable">Very Comfortable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were looking for a boat that would be comfortable to sit in.Easy to get into and easy to keep clean.The battery for the trolling motor is heavy and we had to put 50lbs of weightin the &ldquo;live well&rdquo; for the boat not to list like crazy.After that the boat was level and stable.I love it all.</p>

<h5 id="happy-with-the-boat">Happy with the boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product and well designed. Great for two fishermen on a small body of water. Very satisfied with the product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="be-careful">&ldquo;Be Careful!&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It looked well made but it took on a ton of water on the first trip out. We could hardly pull it out of the water, the hull took on so much water.We sealed around all the openings(there&rsquo;s one on the bottom of boat, one on the back of boat and one on the outsisde) so hopefully it will be better on our next trip out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fast-shipping">fast shipping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The boat is not planned properly. The positioning of the assigned battery placing (because of the weight of battery) makes the whole boat leans on the right. I placed the battery at the center back of the transom so it will be level. I can only use the trolling motor in the back. With a gas motor and gas tank in the back and a trolling motor and battery in the front the boat tilts to the front and thus not level. With only one person sitting in the front seat the boat goes down in the front a little. The short back folding seats are not comfortable to the back. The whole balance design of the boat need some work. If the battery is located in the center rather than on left side, it may solve the problem of tilting to the left. The boat arrived in 5 days from MI to CA. Other than that the rest is OK.</p>
