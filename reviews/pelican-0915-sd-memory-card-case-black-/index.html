<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this Pelican case for SDs for 4 years now. I do not own the older version of this as referenced by other reviewers here in Amazon. Before writing this review, I rechecked the package to make sure it is the 0915 I have. Again after 4 years of using this, I have not had any problems with the SD cards falling off. The SD cards fits nicely. The case is sturdy and has provided adequate protection for the cards for daily storage and for travelling. I can even fit my Apple SD card adapter inside the case. (please see photo). All in all, a great product.</p>

<h5 id="great-case-ignore-the-old-reviews-from-back-in-2012">Great Case! Ignore the old reviews from back in 2012!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever since I purchased my first DSLR camera back in 2009, I&rsquo;ve always had an issue with trying to properly protect and store my SD Memory Cards from the elements and even from myself. When I say myself, I mean that through the years, I&rsquo;d find myself losing an SD card or misplacing one by accident.I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s easier to protect and keep track of my SD Cards by keeping them all in one place. Makes sense, right? Instead of just putting them in random pockets, zippers, or other storage places? This is why I purchased several Pelican 0915 SD Memory Card Protective Cases!I purchased my first two Pelican 0915 SD Card cases back in November 2012 from Amazon and with my ever growing number of SD cards, I found myself purchasing another one just recently, in January 2014.A lot of the reviews on Amazon seem a bit dismal about the product, basically saying that it&rsquo;s a bad design, it doesn&rsquo;t hold the cards correctly, that the old design was better etc.. But honestly, after using this case for the past 3 years or so, those reviews sound like gibberish to me. These cases have held up to their Pelican name brand and I&rsquo;m glad I made the investment and purchased them.From the reviews on Amazon back in 2012 to now, it looks like Pelican made a few adjustments to the case. The latch to open the case now has a groove on it for easy opening and I feel like the inner liner holds the cards better than before. Now, they don&rsquo;t fall out of their particular slots.Storing 12 SD cards in one case may seem like a bit much, but you don&rsquo;t really have to store 12 SD cards in the case. When I didn&rsquo;t have more than 12 cards, I would designate one side of the Pelican case for &ldquo;Empty/Formatted Cards&rdquo; and the other side would be designated for &ldquo;Used Cards.&ldquo;One thing I would recommend would be to put your name on the case just in case you&rsquo;re working with other photographers. You never want to mix up your equipment with anyone else&rsquo;s! As you can see from the picture, I actually put a sticker with my name, website, e-mail address, and phone number on it.All in all, I would say that the Pelican 0915 SD card case would be a great addition to your gear especially if you wanted to protect your cards and keep track of them all in one place!</p>

<h5 id="high-capacity-case-with-great-protection-for-your-sd-cards">High Capacity Case With Great Protection for Your SD Cards</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a solid case for SD cards. I&rsquo;ve used a number of the larger Pelican cases and have found the quality to be excellent. As a testament to how tough Pelican gear is, I&rsquo;ve relied on Pelican cases to keep expensive camera and video equipment safe on some pretty wild multi-day whitewater rafting expeditions in the Idaho wilderness. My equipment stayed dry and free of sand for several trips which is saying something. These SD card cases are of similar quality. They are if anything over-built for the task. The hinge and clasp are heavy duty and the protective foam is cut out perfectly to hod my cards securely. The polycarbonate case is thick and comes with an O-ring seal to keep water and contaminants out.The cards are easy to access, the labels can be read easily and I&rsquo;m confident they will be well protected. It holds 12 SD cards, 6 mini SD cards and 6 micro SD cards which is more than I ever need to carry.The only draw back I see is the cases are a little larger that some of the aluminum and plastic card &ldquo;wallets&rdquo; that I have in my collection. If you&rsquo;re really short on space in your camera bag or vest, that may be an issue for you. That&rsquo;s the trade off for a much more robust case.Overall, a very nice SD card case and well worth the money to protect your expensive cards and priceless memories.</p>

<h5 id="good-case-has-a-clip-for-a-lanyard-or-secure-way-to-tie-it-down">Good case - has a clip for a lanyard or secure way to tie it down</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this one because it supports both SD cards for cameras as well as micro-SD cards for GoPro cameras. I could have one case that has everything in it. It has a little plastic slot on one end to which you can attach a lanyard or key chain. I bought the &ldquo;ESUMIC Colorful Multi-Purpose PU Spring Keychains Clasp Flexible Coiled Tether Lanyard Stretchy Cable Cord&rdquo; package and attached one of those to it, where I&rsquo;ll clip it to something like a camera bag, helmet bag, etc. so I don&rsquo;t lose the Pelican case. It appears to be water resistant to a some rain but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like you&rsquo;d buy this model for scuba or open top boat activities.This item arrived in perfect condition, at Prime speed with no additional shipping costs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using a Pelican SD card case for years. It has been with me everywhere from theme parks to swamps and back. Never has it let me down. My cards are always safe and dry. When my wife decided to take up photography with me, she needed a card case of her own. Naturally I ordered another Pelican case. The new case is great, except the plastic seems a little cheaper than my original case. It is still sturdy feeling. I have no qualms about sitting on it or dragging it through god knows where, but it just feels a tad cheaper. Only time will tell if it is as sturdy as my original, but so far it has done its job well and Pelican is a brand I trust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had bought the original version of this case many years back, and lasted over a few years before SD cards started to come lose. After only a month of using this case, cards were constantly falling out of each slot every time I opened the case.</p>

<p>I have several Pelican products, mainly larger cases to carry tools &amp; gear in, so adding this great case for my camera&rsquo;s SD cards was a no brainer.</p>
