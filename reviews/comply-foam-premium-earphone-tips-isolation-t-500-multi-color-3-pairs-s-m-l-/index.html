<h5 id="the-tips-make-everything-better">The Tips Make Everything Better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have these tips for so many of my earphones. They work great and will last you a while if you take care of them.They really help with fit and helping sound signatures to come through loud and clear.Also, the multi-color ones are great for earphones that have small left/right markings. I will put the red color on the right and the blue on the left. This way it makes it easy to see where each earphone goes with a quick glance.</p>

<h5 id="wow-best-thing-to-happen-to-headphones-since-we-stopped-using-jagged-rocks-as-earpieces">WOW. Best thing to happen to headphones since we stopped using jagged rocks as earpieces!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW. These are literally the best thing to happen to headphones since we stopped using jagged rocks as cushioning. Hyperbole? Maybe. However, these have completely transformed my listening experience. I&rsquo;m using them with the Jaybird BlueBuds X. The silicone tips that came with the headphones kept falling off, often inside my ear canal. The isolation and bass response were not good, and they would become uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. Then I switched to the weird &ldquo;sound-isolating&rdquo; stepped tips. Those were even less comfortable and sounded even worse. In a final act of desperation I ordered the Comply Premium Replacement Foam Earphone Earbud Tips - Isolation T-500 (Multi-Color, 3-Pairs, Large). My first impression was that they were quite ugly. My second impression was that these were in no danger of ever coming off of my headphones, considering how much force I had to use to get them on. Then I stuck them in my ears&hellip;..Pure bliss. It&rsquo;s like having fluffy clouds in your ears. The noise isolation is superb; I can&rsquo;t hear ANYTHING but the music now. And, my headphones have BASS. I&rsquo;m not actually a big fan of bass, especially in headphones, but they were seriously lacking before, and now I might have to get an equalizer app to tone it down a bit. All in all these would have been a bargain at twice the price; without them I would have basically stopped using my headphones, and now I&rsquo;m going to use them all the time!</p>

<h5 id="love-these-i-use-them-with-mee-m6-pro">Love these. I use them with Mee M6 Pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these. I use them with Mee M6 Pro. I use red on the right and blue on the left to make it easier to get them in the right ears on stage. I wish they sold them that way without the dark grey&hellip; Also the three pair packaging is only useful if you know your size. The package that has all three sizes could have been useful, except the M6 Pro comes with Comply mediums, which seemed to fit (so I knew small was out). I then ordered the 3 color pack in medium only to find them slightly smaller than what came with the M6 Pro. So I ordered the Large and now have a good fit but also have have quite a few extra tips&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="comfortable-but-not-sure-the-price-is-worth-the-longevity">Comfortable, but not sure the price is worth the longevity&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit worried purchasing these after reading reviews on their longevity, and it appears that people weren&rsquo;t far off on saying they were not very tough. I ordered my set on 12 Feb and received them shortly after ordering. I use my earbuds at least 4 times a week for an hour+ each use and today I experienced my first failure.Overall I was very pleased with the comfort of these tips. They fit solid and were initially very firm. Over the past two months the memory foam gave out and especially in the past two weeks they are less memory foam and more really soft comfortable tips! Today (5/4/16) I got my last wear out of the first pair I&rsquo;ve put on my ear buds where one of the red tips I&rsquo;m using has split and starting falling apart. I didn&rsquo;t realize the tear at first, but I could tell that my right bud kept slowly falling out of position as I walked.To be honest I&rsquo;m not sure how fair my rating of three stars is; but I feel that I should have gotten more than two and a half months out of them. The majority of wear has been during weight lifting and I have not been extremely sweaty during/after my workouts. I don&rsquo;t run either, so walking or doing the elliptical has been at a pace where I had a raised heart rate, but not sweating much. I&rsquo;d imagine if I were a runner and constantly sweaty that these probably would have got a month&rsquo;s worth of wear.To conclude, you do get three &ldquo;pairs&rdquo; of tips; however, from my experience you&rsquo;ll probably get a little over 8 months of life from all three pairs. If you&rsquo;re running more/sweating more than you may want to consider a different type of tip like silicone. I may be switching myself after these have all failed.</p>

<h5 id="premium-replacement-tips-made-in-the-states">Premium replacement tips made in the States!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you own any set of earbuds? If so, do yourself a huge favor and replace the factory tips that came with them with the Comply isolation or comfort tips! Seriously, you won&rsquo;t regret it. I&rsquo;m currently using these with a pair of PSB M4U 4 earbuds (which I highly recommend!) and I love them. The T-200&rsquo;s are made from super-soft memory foam and cause little to no irritation. I can wear these all day and never experience any discomfort. The same can&rsquo;t be said for the cheap, rubber tips that come with most earbuds these days. The PSBs are the exception to the rule. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they came with Comply tips pre-installed. It took around 4-6 months for me to wear out the factory tips and by then I knew that nothing else but Comply would be acceptable. If you&rsquo;re in the market for new tips you really should check these out first!</p>

<h5 id="i-like-these-tips">I like these tips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like these tips, I don&rsquo;t love them.I have them on my Panasonic RP-HJE120&rsquo;s. I originally bought medium but they were too big for my small-medium canals. Once I bought the smalls to replace the mediums, I could get a good fit and definitely noticed the difference in noise reduction, although they aren&rsquo;t completely noise isolating. The tips are noise reducing and do enhance the audio volume and clarity when listening to music or tv.As far as comfort goes: they are less comfortable then the original silicone earbuds that came with the panasonic&rsquo;s originally, but the Comply do a better job at sealing out outside noise and increasing the audio quality in that same way. So its a toss for me. I feel a lot of pressure in my ear canals if I wear them for too long.The instructions on how to put them in your ears is pretty straight forward, although it took a few tries to get to the point where I felt I was wearing them correctly. I also watched a few videos to make sure I was doing it right. Size does matter, as the larger ones, I could not get to stay in my canals because they would push out and back when back to their original size (in ear).</p>
