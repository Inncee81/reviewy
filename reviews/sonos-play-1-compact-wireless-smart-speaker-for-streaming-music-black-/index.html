<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="i-really-like-it">I really like it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I must&rsquo;ve read about 250 reviews on the Sonos products to include the Play 1s and the Playbar/sub/5.1 system. I know all of the criticism about the lack of an HDMI input and the lack of DTS support and I absolutely agree with those criticisms. There isn&rsquo;t any reason not to support the best formats on the market. That being said, I bought the Sonos Playbar, Sub and two Play 1s after going through three Sony playbar/sub combos and the Yamaha 203. Understand, I downgraded from a 7.1 system anchored by an Onkyo AV receiver, two Bose floor speakers and a set of Energy 5s + subwoofer. I simply got sick of the wires and wanted a clean look and decided to go with a playbar. After trying the four other systems and not being really impressed with the sound of any of them, I decided to roll the dice on the Sonos with the desire being 1) good sound and 2) wireless as much as possible. I wasn&rsquo;t concerned in the least with all of the hoopla about connectivity with streaming services etc&hellip;So, I install the system on a newer LED tv that has a 5.1 pass through on the optical port and bam! I fall in love with THE SOUND. I get it. I&rsquo;m not trying to compete with an audiophilic, perfect system nor do I care about specs as much as I do about liking what I hear. And the bottom line is that I really like what I hear. I get the full 5.1 out of the system and the Play 1s sound fantastic as the rear pair of the surround sound set up. They really do sound good. The playbar is a great anchor for the TV when it comes to dialogue and as it acts as a front pair and center speaker for the whole system during movies and music. I apologize to all of the purists out there, but I love the Sonos system.Setup is just too stinking easy. Wow.And the streaming piece that meant nothing to me&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;well, I played around with Spotify Premiere and what can I tell you? I can watch a boring football game while hoping for something spectacular to occur and instantly switch to listening to any of my 35 kabillion songs while keeping the game on. If something groovy happens on the tube, I just switch the sound back to the TV. There is zero lag between the TV and the system or between any of the separate speakers. outstanding synch. And with version 7.0 of the Sonos app I can stream from the Spotify app instead of having to use the Sonos app. Sweet.Why only four stars then? As mentioned at the start of this diatribe, Sonos needs to get off their elitist butts and add HDMI connectivity and support for DTS. It is a tough decision to spring this kind of scratch for a system that could be phenomenal &ldquo;if only&hellip;.&rdquo;. After reading through countless forum threads about the issue, it almost seems as if the Sonos team takes a certain pride in telling their paying faithful to shut up and colors they decide are in our best interest. Not cool.All in all it&rsquo;s hard to criticize the Sonos Play 1 as I have it set up in conjunction with the playbar and the sub. But it&rsquo;s expensive and technologically crippled for no apparent reason. I would recommend it if you can afford it, you aren&rsquo;t looking for audiophile ego strokes, you want to scrap the wires, and if you have a TV that passes the full 5.1 through the optical port.</p>

<h5 id="solid-speaker">Solid Speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before buying the PLAY:1, I did extension research on what I should and should not expect from it as well as its limitation. On the positive side, I expected a well-designed compact speaker that did not require a corded connection and that play music from my Groove Music (and lots of other accounts). On the negative side, I expected solid, but not steller/bass-tweeter-treble balanced sound; expected a speaker that did not connect using Bluetooth (just LAN/DSL/Cable/T1 Wi-Fi connectivity); and a speaker that required a electrical socket to stay powered on (no battery for mobility). All of this was true, please be prepared for those specifics.Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m satisfied with the speaker, but no speaker (like any product) is perfect. You always find out you need more. For example, I have a lot of music in my OneDrive account that I uploaded after ripper music from CDs that are out of print and had not yet come out digitally. I cannot play that music straight from my OneDrive account to my PLAY:1 because it is not listed as part of the available music services in the SONOS program that you have to install on your phone, computer, etc. to use the speaker. I have no problem with the software; I just cannot access that service (and there are others like iTunes Radio). The only way to play music from this source is to download those 500 songs to the computer on which I am using the SONOS program (which then &ldquo;finds&rdquo; those songs and makes them available to play). It&rsquo;s not too bad, but I specifically put them on OneDrive to be able to play them on any device without having to download them and take up computer hard drive space.My favorite part of the speaker is the smooth connection playback. I have not experienced any skipping, stuttering, muffled sound, or play delays yet&hellip;and no buffering between tracks. It actually plays my music better than the native app plays it.I use this for my kitchen right now, especially when I get up in the morning and wish to listen to my NPR/State ETV radio station (through TuneIn radio&hellip;which is built in to the SONOS program; but you cannot connect your own account if you have one through TuneIn). The sound is pleasant when turned down to medium levels&hellip;and you can hear all parts of the audio whether you are right next to the speaker or someone where else.On the whole, I like the SONOS PLAY:1. There are some things I would like to have, but they are not deal breakers since I knew what I was mostly getting when I bought it. Yes, I plan on getting a PLAY:3 (for my bedroom) and a PLAY:5 for the Great Room.</p>

<h5 id="wow-this-is-all-i-need">Wow. This is all I need.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a college graduate, i saved money to buy my first stereo and then replaced it with a better one when I became a partner in a big consulting firm. Then I stopped listening to music. In that period, music changed. It went not only digital (I had hundreds of CDs) but it moved to hard disks and computers. Sonos allows me to access my computer and listen to all the music I want using my iPhone as the user interface. I&rsquo;m happily listening to music again.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-no-idea-how-good-it-is-until-i-bought-it-and-plugged-it">I have no idea how good it is until I bought it and plugged it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no idea how good it is until I bought it and plugged it in. Forget about Bluetooth speakers, no matter how good they claim they are. Sonos wireless speakers are the way to go. Now, I just bough a Play:5 also. Oh my GOD, this thing is a music lover precious little treasure!! I am not kidding you, it&rsquo;s exceptionally good, well designed speaker. I have my Play:1 in my bedroom, the sound is well covered the whole room. I am a very happy customer here!! Don&rsquo;t wait. Life is too short to waste your time on lousy little sorry-ass speakers. Buy some good ones and live a better life. I have no regret!!! Only regret is, I should have found out about Sonos sooner!</p>

<h5 id="stopped-supporting-audible">Stopped Supporting Audible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sonos used to support audio books from audible - until they stopped and removed audible from their app. Now audible does not work with these speakers. Every time I listen to an Audible book in my house, I look at my useless overpriced speakers and feel mad that Sonos duped me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-more-stereo">No more stereo</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally got into the 21st century and got rid of my receiver,CD player, and radio unit and just started streaming from my laptop. I bought speakers and am very happy with the sound quality, ease of use and quality.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-everyman-s-system">Excellent &lsquo;Everyman&rsquo;s&rsquo; System</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Completed a 5.1 system (Playbar, Sub, two Play 1&rsquo;s. Easy installation, sounds good, painless. Not the ultimate system, but stands up to 98% of the content.</p>

<p>I bought 4 of these without realizing that they CAN NOT BE USED WITH A STEREO OR TV.That is all, I bought them to use with my TV and then realized they don&rsquo;t work like&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that each speaker creates its own group in Sonos so you can play different things on different speakers. Duh! So this was even better than I expected it to be &hellip;</p>
