<h5 id="great-cable-at-any-price">Great cable - at any price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line here is it works. I&rsquo;ve played in the HT universe for a long time - 20 years. When I started, 5.1 was the top of the line and component cables were the state of the art. One of the things I&rsquo;ve found, and it is particularly true in home theater, is that you get 99% of the performance in most decent consumer products. This cable is a decent consumer product.There are some variables in the use of long cables however. Most of those lie not in the cable but in the devices attached to it. I needed this to go from a Marantz SR6009 to a inexpensive projector. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect, but it works flawlessly. Interestingly enough, not only does it work when the receiver is providing juice but also when the receiver is off and just performing &lsquo;pass-through&rsquo; operations from my DVR. I discovered that on accident. Pretty darn good.People really involved in their hobbies spend huge multiples to gain ever smaller percentages of improvements. Usually, for improvements that can only be proved on lab instruments. Oxygen-free 4 gauge speaker cables. Monster Cable interconnects of every stripe. And on and on. Some things do improve with more spend - receivers and amps and displays. Sure. Some things&hellip;don&rsquo;t.Unless your goal is to go on forums and ask &ldquo;Did you see an improvement when you bought&hellip;&rdquo; and name-drop your new addition or to endlessly argue the pros and cons of items that make the most insignificant differences, buying good quality stuff is really all most folks need. And as much as most folks can determine any differences with.If your goal is instead to have a great looking and sounding system - you&rsquo;ve found the right cable, right here. As I rebuild my HT room (last one destroyed by a storm, a 120 foot tree and a negligent neighbor), I will buy other Mediabridge products. To me, that&rsquo;s what a recommendation is.</p>

<h5 id="updating-with-4k-hdmi-cable-wiring">Updating with 4K HDMI Cable Wiring</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently needed HDMI cables to be installed behind the family room walls for the newly mounted flat screen tv and the other equipment to compliment the receiver and surround sound. The service that did the installation work was very pleased with the product and that it was 4K ready giving me flexibility for the future. The shipment came in time for the install date. I needed only 2 cables but purchased a total of 4 in the event I need for another part of the house. I definitely would recommend. The 4K cable has a RED Strip for identifying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-cables">Love these cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like these cables. They perform in instances where other cables with the same specs have not. I have several of these now as I have decided there is no better cable for the price. It outperforms more expensive cables as well. Grabbed a 50&rsquo; for my TV across the room and wouldn&rsquo;t have used anything other than Mediabridge. It&rsquo;s the only cable I trust to go through the trouble of buying a long cable (online), running it through my ceiling 50&rsquo;, and then putting my good content through it and having it work every time. Other cables have given me trouble where these never have. I also like how they seem so snug in my devices when I plug them in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="50-feet-is-no-problem-for-mediabridge">50 Feet Is No Problem For Mediabridge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 50 foot HDMI cable is just the latest of the numerous Mediabridge HDMI cables I own and this one is just as great as the previous cables in use right now.I needed a cable this long to reach from the back of my Onkyo TX-RZ800 AV receiver for Zone 2 video (yes, video in Zone 2 via HDMI), across the living room, out the door to the patio and across the patio to where our Vizio 32&rdquo; HDTV was. After the connections, there was some slackness in the cable so I figure the distance was between 42&rsquo; to 47&rsquo;. The AV signal was crisp and clear and the length of the cable was no detriment at all.I&rsquo;m very, very pleased with the performance of this extraordinarily long HDMI cable, but why wouldn&rsquo;t I be? It&rsquo;s a MEDIABRIDGE!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-for-me-even-in-wall-read-review-for-explanation">Worked great for me. Even in wall (read review for explanation)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I needed. Not sure what they say it isn&rsquo;t rated for in wall use, probably insulation properties. (Only the 50&rsquo; cable is supposed to be rated for in wall use officially) In my case I just made sure I routed it through my attic back to my media closet without touching or running parallel to any power lines and it works great. Not worried a bit about it, it is safer up there than running across the floor where people are walking all the time. I connected it to a Blu-Ray player and it works perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="flashing-black-screen-picture">Flashing Black Screen/Picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had problems from the beginning with this cable, but it has taken me a long time to figure it out since I bought an entire home theatre system at once. The screen goes black, then the picture comes back, then black again - repeatedly. I thought it was my Sony DVD player at first, since I had no idea an HDMI cable would cause such a thing.I moved and put everything back in the boxes they came in and just set it back up. Before it was annoying, but now it is even worse. I unplugged the cable and plugged in another one and viola, it works perfectly. I don&rsquo;t know if I just got a bad one or the quality they advertise is not accurate. Either way, money wasted!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="put-together-well-and-i-like-the-rubber-coating-for-going-over-rafters">put together well and I like the rubber coating for going Over rafters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EXCEPTIONAL VALUE FOR THE MONEY! I am a mobile DJ of 15 years. I needed a HDMI cable for karaoke as well as for music video&rsquo;s. Connecting from a laptop to the customers tv&rsquo;s. Distances ranged from 15&rsquo; to 45&rsquo;. Was NOT sure if a 50&rsquo; cable would lose signal or not, but took a chance. This cable is rugged, put together well and I like the rubber coating for going Over rafters. Well protected. The signal is PERFECT. No loss or lag. Vibrant colors, PERFECT for my needs. Will def. purchase this brand again if in need!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-hdmi-cable">Excellent HDMI cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent HDMI cable. My previous cable (a cheap temporary experiment) displayed a blurry, highly pixelated picture.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great length. Very clear picture on the TV from the Computer for HDMI use.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-so-happy-that-i-spent-the-extra-money-on-these">I am so happy that I spent the extra money on these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this 50 foot and some 25 foot HDMI cables from Amazon by Mediabridge along with several others from other manufacturers at cheaper prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My other HDMI cable broke, so got this one, and it was sturdy and long. I put in through my ceiling in the media room, worked perfectly fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-solid-cable">A Solid Cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a solid cable (as in quality). It has performed as expected and with confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Media Bridge has proven to provide great cords for good prices&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Works great !Picture improved a lot.</p>

<h5 id="one-bad-one-in-the-batch">One bad one in the batch?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Never had an issue with media bridge, never ever until now. So what&rsquo;s changed, I don&rsquo;t know. Hopefully just a freak thing but plugged it in no problem.</p>
