<h5 id="great-photos-and-video-appreciate-the-wide-angle-and-zooming">Great photos and video, appreciate the wide angle and zooming</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this camera one month ago and find it takes very good quality photos and videos, even hand held long zoom shots. I posted a few close up cropped bird photos from a recent vacation to British Columbia in the product gallery (Flicker, Owl and Eagle). The shots were hand-held or stabilized on a railing or bed of gravel (no tripod).The hard part is initially focusing on the bird with just the LCD screen and no view finder. Even with the moveable LCD panel I find it helps to spot movement by the subject and then I am able to further zoom in (under normal daylight conditions).I really appreciate the wide angle lens. This is very helpful for taking photos to capture an entire room in your house for example.I have also taken a few videos and the quality seems outstanding to me.This camera does not have built-in GPS. I had a prior camera with built in GPS and do not miss that feature (battery drainer).It starts up very fast and so far I do not mind that you have to pop up/open the flash manually. Most photos do not need a flash and its easy enough most times to get two photos in to see if its better with the flash or not. Its just a bit of a learning curve for those of us that come from digital cameras that decide for themselves if they need the flash (automatic).The camera uses AA batteries. I rotate between two sets of Duracell HR6 rechargeable AA&rsquo;s and keep a set of Alkaline&rsquo;s in the bag for backup.I store the camera in a Case Logic case (DCB-304) and purchased a sling strap that screws onto the tripod mount (Case Logic DCS-101). I find half the time I don&rsquo;t use the strap at all because the camera has such a great grip. The primary memory card I am using is a SanDisk 32GB (Class 10, 45 MB/s).</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-all-around-camera-update-at-end">Fantastic all-around camera <em>UPDATE AT END</em></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend kept sending me pictures she&rsquo;d taken from her camera and they were so clear and detailed that I asked her what camera she was using and she said the Nikon L830 so I purchased a refurbished on here to check it out for myself.Simply put&hellip;I love the camera. The pictures I get from it are just as nice (even better sometimes) than I get from my more expensive cameras. I take this camera with me everywhere now. Even at full zoom you often get pictures that turn out well. They lose a little sharpness sometimes, but still decent shots.This camera is a great camera for a beginner and especially nice for someone who wants an easy camera to use with a reliable auto mode.I love the simplicity of the menu and how easy and quick it is to switch between settings. Besides the high-quality pictures I&rsquo;m getting from it, my favorite thing about this camera is just how user-friendly and easy to use it is. There are lots of photo setting options to play around with from the menu or simply use auto mode or easy auto mode.The Available Shooting Modes are: Easy Auto Mode, Scene Mode, Special Effects, Smart Portrait and Auto Mode.The Available Scene modes are: Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night Portrait, Party/Indoor, Beach, Snow, Sunset, Dusk/Dawn, Night Landscape, Close-up, Food, Museum, Fireworks Show, Black and White copy, Backlighting, Easy Panorama and Pet Portrait.The Available Special Effects are: Soft, Nostalgic Sepia, High Contrast, High Key, Low Key, Selective Color, Pop, Super Vivid, Cross Process, Toy Camera1 and Toy Camera2You can also apply special effects and filter effects after taking a picture when in the review picture mode and it will save the original version of the picture along with the newly changed version. A fun one to use with this feature when taking people or pet shots is the fish eye effect.Video clarity and coloring is really nice.I purchased the plum camera and it&rsquo;s very pretty so that is a bonus too.<em>Update</em> I bought this camera in May refurbished. A couple months later it started occasionally malfunctioning. It would lock up and refuse to take pictures or the zoom would keep going full zoom when you were trying to adjust it and would not come back from being full zoom. I would have to take the batteries out and put them back in to get it to work properly again. I contacted the seller but they said it was outside of the 45 day policy so they wouldn&rsquo;t do anything about it and to contact the manufacturer. I am not adjusting my rating because the camera when it worked was awesome. I just made the expensive mistake of buying it refurbished from them.</p>

<h5 id="service-and-seller-was-great-no-issues-and-quick-shipping">Service and seller was great. No issues and quick shipping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Service and seller was great. No issues and quick shipping. I was really excited about receiving and expected better from this camera. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to focus very well and a point and shoot should be better than that. I have messed with the settings and there seems to be no way to make this better. Deleted more pics than I have kept. A lot of indoor pictures are completely washed out as well. My $60 camera takes clear focused shots every time. Regretting this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-camera">Awesome camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Takes awesome pictures. Great camera for the price. Anyone can use it. Love the simplicity, the 34x zoom, the easy picture modes and manual setttings, the video, the sound&hellip;basically everything about it. I did a ton of research on the camera and it&rsquo;s close relative out there the Canon PowerShot SX510 HS. Though, these cameras are very similar in their class and both manufacturers have excellent reputations, there was a line up of subtle differences that were slightly &ldquo;improved&rdquo; with the Nikon Coolpix L830. I am sure I would have been content with the Canon but I love this Nikon. For a $200 range camera, try to avoid expecting too much from zoom without a tri-pod but even still know that the picture is not going to be perfectly clear zoomed all the way to 34x. Also, I would not expect a great deal from the image stabilization. For a camera in its class it does a great job with both of the features I mentioned just know it is simply not going to have the abilities of a camera like say the Canon EOS Rebel T3i or above.</p>
