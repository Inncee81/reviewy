<h5 id="great-product-and-easy-to-install">Great Product and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Glass Pro is an excellent screen protector for the Samsung Tab Pro 12.2. When it comes to screen protectors, I have little experience with installation but the Glass Pro was really super easy. I took the advice of some of the more experienced installers and did the application in my bathroom after I had run a hot shower to make the room steamy. The steam cuts down on most of the lint flying in the air which essential to a successful screen protector application. After cleaning the screen of my Samsung Tab Pro with the provider lens wipes (one wet and one dry) I used the installation stickers included in the package to lift the Glass Pro from the package, peeled the backing off, lined up the screen protector, and starting at the bottom of the Samsung&rsquo;s screen, I gently lowered the Glass Pro on the to the screen of the Samsung. It adhered like a charm. I wish I had taken a video of the actual application because it almost looks like the Glass Pro is suctioned onto the screen of the Samsung&hellip;it&rsquo;s really pretty cool. The Glass Pro has rounded corners and the edges are just shy of full coverage. The one negative to the Glass Pro is that it does not come with specific instructions although instructions are noted on the box. But was pretty easy to figure out what needed to be done. Overall, I am totally satisfied with the Glass Pro.</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Moshi screen protector for a while, and I never realized how terrible a matte screen protector made my Note 12.2 look until I put on this glass one. Everything is brilliant and vibrant again. It&rsquo;s definitely thick enough to be incredibly protective, and it really doesn&rsquo;t scratch like the advertisement says. I have a similar screen protector from the same company on my Kindle voyage and I highly recommend both of them. It is also very easy to put on without dust and bubbles, and if any particles do you happen to get underneath the screen protector a piece of scotch tape can pull them right out. It is cut perfectly, fits the screen just right and I can&rsquo;t speak highly enough about it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-and-customer-service-not-so-great-installation-instruction">Great product and customer service. Not so great installation instruction.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not hesitate to buy this screen protector. It&rsquo;s great quality along with great customer service. They actually show concern and want you to be satisfied with their product. I first had a bad experience but I contacted them and the company got back with me very fast and I had a replacement within the next week. Installation can be difficult but only because the 12.2 is a very large screen and you have to be extremely careful not to crack the screen while also not touching the adhesive side of the glass. Most important thing I can say is DO NOT JUST PLACE THE GLASS ON YOU DEVICE AS THE INSTRUCTION SAYS. YOU WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT AIR BUBBLES AND YOU CANNOT REMOVE WITHOUT CRACKING ONCE APPLIED. YOU MUST ADJUST IT PROPERLY AND THEN PROCEED TO SLOWLY LAY IT DOWN STARTING AT ONE END AND (AGAIN SLOWLY) GENTLY WORK YOUR WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE. I also think the placement stickers are unnecessary because it can ruin the installation. This process requires patience but you will have great results. I can honestly say I am a very satisfied customer. Overall 5 stars because I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

<h5 id="the-descriptions-regarding-this-product-it-is-not-as-efficient">The descriptions regarding this product it is not as efficient &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The descriptions regarding this product it is not as efficient as I would expecting it. Package Includes:1 X tempered glass screen protector, did not come with the &ldquo;1 X Microfiber Cloth&rdquo;, came with a very small 1 X Alcohol Cleaning Pad and drying pad too small for my large screen, and the alcohol was slightly dry,1 X Installation Guide was - no guide what so ever. Not what I was expecting, however all said it did applied to my screen and left a few bubbles, some I manage to push out and others did not move. I&rsquo;ve purchase many screen protectors for many of my devices and for others and this one I would consider not all that but just ok!</p>

<h5 id="budget-tempered-glass-screen-protector-that-works-like-other-premium-ones-in-the-market">Budget Tempered Glass Screen Protector that works like other Premium ones in the market!!! :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic product from an unknown company. The screen protector is super easy to install and made my Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet look new! :)I have to say that I&rsquo;m impressed w/ this tempered glass screen protector, as the previous one that I had (which wasn&rsquo;t tempered glass) was blocking out a lot of the crispness &amp; screen detail of the tablet. However, with the Rerii I&rsquo;m extremely happy as it looks like it virtually isn&rsquo;t there (that is to say, minimally obstructive) and the S-pen works really well on it too!Get it, if you are on a budget. :)</p>

<h5 id="once-you-go-glass-you-ll-never-go-back-lol">once you go glass, you&rsquo;ll never go back LOL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this glass protector was easy to put on on the first try. did have three big air bubbles, but the air bubbles were easy to remove by pressing on the edge of the air bubble and pushing it to the closest edge. the air bubble moves easily with each push LOL..you cant do that as easily with the plastic film type screen protectors.not only was it easy to put on, it seems to minimize finger print, as im unable to see much finger prints that i would normaly see on a bare screen. and for the minmal finger print that it does have, i feel more comfortable cleaning the protector more than a bare screen.the other thing i noticed with this glass screen protector, it seems much smoother when scrolling with your fingers gliding up and down or left to right as compared to an unprotected screen.i highly recommend this screen and this vendor..thank you for a great product.</p>

<h5 id="worked-amazing-i-thought-my-galaxy-tab-pro-12-was-gone">Worked amazing!! I thought my Galaxy tab Pro 12&rdquo; was gone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok so I&rsquo;m not usually someone who goes on and leaves great feedback. I know I should more but I just never do. But my tablet this morning was knocked off my counter and on to the floor somehow by my pets. Well anyways the pictures will show you the rest. I&rsquo;m extremely happy that I had this tempered glass screen protector. Yes I got all cracked up in spidered but my screen is absolute perfect on my Galaxy note tab pro 12&rdquo;. I could believe that it spidered cracked the whole protector and my screen was perfect when I took it off. Needless to say I&rsquo;ll be buying another one right now. Thank you</p>
