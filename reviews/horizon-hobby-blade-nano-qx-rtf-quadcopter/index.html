<p>The tinyThe tiny Nano QX is RC flying fun you can take with you everywhere. The Nano QX weighs little more than half an ounce and is small enough to fly in spaces no bigger than an office cubicle. Never flown a quad-copter before? No problem. The Nano QX uses the SAFE technology system with sophisticated flight control software to keep itself stable in a hover while in stability mode. If you get in trouble, just let go of the sticks. The SAFE technology system will bring the Nano QX back to a hover all by itself. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics, you can switch the SAFE system to agility mode for faster flying speeds and more maneuverability. SAFE stands for Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope and is central to the performance of the Nano QX. Even new pilots will feel comfortable with the Nano QX in stability mode because SAFE will make sure the quad is always in control and in an upright fashion. You will feel an immediate sense of confidence and be flying around like a pro in no time! Learn more about SAFE at www.flysaferc.com! Nano QX is RC flying fun you can take with you everywhere.

<h5 id="need-a-quad-buy-this">Need a quad, buy this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I got into RC Helis. I started with cheap toy coaxials and worked my way up to full hobby collective pitch helis. There never was a good middle ground as the helicopters were either boring to fly because they were so tame (coaxials) or expensive to fix for the more &ldquo;fun&rdquo; collective pitch. With the SAFE mode which combines stabilization with auto correction, this quad is essentially 3 quads in one.Standard rate with SAFE: Fairly tame and very good for relatively new pilots and indoor use.Dual rate with SAFE: Very agile but still very stable and easy to fly (just a lot quicker and better for outdoors).Agility mode: Essentially behaves like a collective pitch helicopter (no training wheels) and hovering is up to you and not the magic of the little chips inside. Can do stunts (no gimmicky buttons, you have to learn to do them yourself).The small size makes it great for indoor use but where small light aircraft usually suck outside in anything but the calmest of conditions, this tiny bird will hold its own even in a brisk breeze (you will still need to fight but it will fight as opposed to being carried away). The light weight, simple but rugged design makes it very crash friendly. Crashes don&rsquo;t seem to faze this thing at all with the only issues being that threads or other fibers will occasionally wrap under the blades and prevent the propeller from turning freely (just pull off the blade, remove the obstruction, push back on and continue). It&rsquo;s quieter than my other quads (sounds like 4 bumble bees inside but much quieter outside).Cons (not many):No navigation LEDs so low light/night flight is poor for orientation.Blade guards tend to hook on things, would have preferred full ringsToo light to carry any significant mainstream payloads (camera, normal sized LEDs, etc..)Buy this quad as it is near perfect:Other notes- Flight time on the stock 150 mah battery is 5-6 minutes. I get 7-8 minutes with some 200mah Apex batteries I bought- I purchased a DX6i programmable radio since I have a handful of compatible helicopters. You don&rsquo;t need it but if you do get one, you can really tailor the performance to your liking.</p>

<h5 id="blade-nano-is-great-rc-flight-controller-isn-t">Blade Nano is great! RC flight controller isn&rsquo;t</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great beginners drone!I received the quadcopter on time without any shipping problems from Amazon Prime. The box includes everything you see on the webpage and an extra battery. This machine is easy to fly, and has amazing flight characteristics for such a small drone. In no time I was able to hover and maneuver in a small area without crashing.If it flies to the ceiling, the propeller guards on the frame do a fantastic job of protecting the propellers and motors. Its very quick and can get away from you if you don&rsquo;t use the SAFE mode to control the gyros. I lost control at one occasion and the drone crashed into a sink of dishwater. The Blade Nano was completely submerged at the bottom of a sink full of water for about 10 seconds before rescue. I continued flying it wet to keep parts moving till the battery ran out, and then dried the rest of the craft with a hair drier. That was 3 weeks ago; its still working just fine.The propellers sometimes picks up hair or strings from furniture as it flies around the house. This is not a problem as you can quickly remove the plastic props, to remove anything wrapped around the motor spindle. This thing is tuff and easy to care for.The only problem that would not give the product 5 stars is the RC flight controller that comes with the Blade Nano QX. The range seems to be very limited. When I fly outside, the Blade Nano looses signal at about 30-40 yards up or out then drops out of the sky. When I go to retrieve the drone it is able to re-engage and flies again perfectly. I have asked Horizon Hobby to contact me about the range of the controller as a flight issue. No word as yet.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-micro-quad">AWESOME MICRO QUAD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve flown this about 10 times in the 2 days I&rsquo;ve had it. I must say, without a doubt, this quad fly&rsquo;s great. It fly&rsquo;s far better than the other make mini quad which I returned. This Horizon Blade QX was ready to fly as soon as I charged the battery. It looks awesome&hellip; handles like a much larger quad&hellip; has dual rates which you can change it flight&hellip; also has a stability mode which is good for beginners, and an agility mode which allows for rolls and loops. There is also a high rate, and low rate (70% of the high rate). The controller defaults to the stability mode, and the high rate, which is my favorite setup. It&rsquo;s easy to change either the rate or the mode.To change the mode all you have to do is press down on the left stick. To change the rates push down on the right stick. Another cool feature is you always know what flight mode and rate setting you are flying. In the stability mode there is a blue LED on the quad&hellip; the agility mode the LED is red. In the high rate setting there is a solid red LED on the controller which turns to blinking red in the low rate mode.It is also very durable. I &ldquo;painted&rdquo; the ceiling a few times, flown it into the walls, drapery&rsquo;s, sofa, etc. Each time the quad was not harmed in any way&hellip; I just turned it right side up and continued flying. On one occasion, I actually managed to fly the quad into my arm. Neither me, or the quad was harmed !! And get this&hellip; Horizon even print up a manual for you&hellip; It&rsquo;s rather thick at 99 pages&hellip; but, not to worry&hellip; it&rsquo;s written in several languages. The English portion is 25 pages. This is much better than the fold out instructions which come with many products today, or the one with no words, only pictures! Also the LED on the quad turns to blinking red when the lipo need to be charged, and the 4 in 1 controller cuts power to the motors.Also comes with an extra green body, some propellers, and a battery,(mine came with 2 batteries), and a neat USB battery charger.In my mind this quad has all the plus&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve stated above.The only con I can see is flight time&hellip; it fly&rsquo;s for about 6 minutes on the supplied 25C batteries. I purchased 2 extra batteries (Eflite 45C) which do give a few minutes longer fun time, and more punch to the performance. Be aware if you fly with the 25C batteries and switch to the 45C&rsquo;s, you will have to reset your trims, as the 45C is slightly heavier and longer&hellip; That said I ordered 2 more 45C&rsquo;s giving me a total of 4. I only fly with the 45&rsquo;s so I don&rsquo;t have to retrim it when I switch to the 25C bats.Just so you know, I paid full price, and did not receive any compensation to write this review. I am very happy with this purchase, and I highly recommend this quad. It&rsquo;s awesome !!</p>

<h5 id="really-liked-it-but">really liked it but?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a very good device. Mine needed to be trimmed before it would hover. It took some digging in the manual to figure out how to get it to hover.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-durable-at-all">Not durable at all&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is a complete waste of money. I invested way too much between the Nano QX and a blade inductrix which are made by the same manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<p>Came opened, had to return it.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-for-a-little-bit-but-it-will-die-soon">Works great for a little bit - but it will die soon.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, this product worked great for a few months. But after a year of non use, I put new batteries in the copter and transmitter and I get nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-product-great-value-for-money">Fantastic product. Great value for money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pay attention to any negative reviews. This product is fantastic. It gives you more bang for the buck than just about anything you can buy.</p>

<p>Great indoor &ldquo;serious&rdquo; drone.</p>

<h5 id="great-drone-but-the-extra-battery-is-a-no-go">Great drone but the extra battery is a no go</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got Quadcopter with the extra battery. Its a great flyer but disappointed the extra battery does not fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-1-minute">Worked for 1 minute</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked once. Really cool looking drone. If all you want is something to sit on the shelf this is the one for you. It did not come bound to the controller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these quad copters</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of">Waste of $$$$$$</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Buyer Beware. I purchased this for a Christmas Gift for my son. On the second flight the wires broke off one of the motors. I bought extra batteries and the charger.</p>
