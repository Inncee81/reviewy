<p>Color:6 plus white
Have you dropped your iPhone 6 PLUS(5.5 inch) and damaged the touch screen, interfering with images? Or has it otherwise become scratched or scuffed?</p>

<p>If your iPhone 6 had damage done to the screen, or if you are having display issues that cause a black or Black screen or inky spots that interfere with pictures and other images, you do not have to replace the entire iPhone 6.
For a fraction of the cost, this LCD display and touch screen digitizer assembly replacement can repair a damaged touch screen and the LCD display at the same time. This complete front assembly in white will allow you to see images clearly again, without inky spots or scratches to the touch screen. If your touch screen is not responding properly, this assembly can also replace a broken touch screen, and for a fraction of the cost of a brand new iPhone 6 PLUS.</p>

<p>And we also provide you a Instruction card and tolls included. You could replace the screen all by yourself. There are small cables and screws to be connected. Every cable and screw is different from others. They must be connected in correct position. Any small mistake during connection will cause problems.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-it-myself">I am so glad I did it myself</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well it has been 2 weeks since I installed this screen/digitizer combo on my phone and let me tell you what. I am so glad I did it myself. It took me a while mostly because I was nervous I would ruin something. But after I was done it booted up and all I had to do was connect to my computer and everything was back to normal. The only reason I give this a 4 star is because the tools were sort of cheap and stripped a few of the screws inside the phone so it made it very difficult to remove the screen and replace it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="iphone-repair-buyer-beware">iPhone repair- buyer beware!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have repaired over 300 iPhones. This was one of the cheapest made kits I have ever seen. The screwdrivers were not even assembled correctly. I screen itself has flimsy cables and they didn&rsquo;t even include the $0.02 ear speaker screen/rubber piece. Won&rsquo;t be buying one from this seller again. Buyer beware. There&rsquo;s better out there!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-easy-to-install-using-a-youtube-video">This was easy to install using a YouTube video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was easy to install using a YouTube video! Only 3 stars due to one area on the top of the screen that appears brighter than any other area. Very small spot that I can live with though. Also the glass is deprecating from the gram after install. For the price though I&rsquo;m not complaining. I got my iPhone working again and that was what I wanted!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-item-came-just-as-described-but-here-is">This item came just as described. But here is &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This item came just as described. But here is a note to buyers everywhere: make sure you read ALL of the information about your phone and this replacement item BEFORE you order. My iPhone 6+ is a model that they list as not-compatible. Mine is Rose Gold A1687 and I didn&rsquo;t think to look at the last slide of photos to verify that it would not work. The variation came out when trying to install and the screws and brackets do not line up. The seller is not at fault here; I am upset with myself for not understanding that there are several different models of the iPhone 6+.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="prefect-replacement-for-the-iphone-6-plus">Prefect replacement for the iphone 6 Plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>awesome Replacement Screen, a lot cheaper than they used to be. you can tell it is an off brand but what do freaking expect for a $20 replacement screen for a $700 iphone. It still has all the features but the average user really wont know the difference. The only reason I know is because I deal with them every day and it is my job to notice things like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-gorilla-glass-expect-imperfections">Not Gorilla Glass, Expect Imperfections</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Be ware, this is far from Apple quality screens. It&rsquo;s fine as a quick fix, and relatively easy to install, but expect light spots and a high contrast display. The screen is laggy as well, so know what your getting into. I would recommend taking your phone to a nearby mall for a higher quality screen if you can afford the $130, otherwise this will work for know, but the screen will break easily if your not careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yellowish-tint-to-it-so-images-won-t-look-exactly-like-they-do-on-the-original-apple-one">&hellip; yellowish tint to it so images won&rsquo;t look exactly like they do on the original apple one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The display has a slight yellowish tint to it so images won&rsquo;t look exactly like they do on the original apple one. The screen is not rounded on the edges like the original and it stands out of the phone much more. The biggest problem is that the glass started to separate from the plastic bezel almost immediately after installation. Luckily amazon let me return the item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective-digitizer">Defective digitizer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Aweful digitizer my phone worked for while and then started acting up so I didn&rsquo;t think nothing of it thought was something else but phone shuts completely off on its own opens apps by self texts or calls people freezes up and then I shut off and restart sometimes works sometimes doesn&rsquo;t and then says searching for service and takes hours before comes back but then can&rsquo;t open nothing or call and screen colors are all different gets lines in them not happy this is second one I ordered thought it was me replacing it so took apart again and I redid it and still does same thing doesn&rsquo;t work very aweful my iPhone is completely paid off now have to get another or hope I can get this fixed for cheap will not recommend to no one</p>

<h5 id="the-screen-works-and-it-came-on-time-but">The screen works and it came on time, but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen works and it came on time, but once the screen was on the phone, the screen glass had already begun to deprecate from the plastic base</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-second-has-chips-of-border-missing-and-i-m-not-happy-at-all">The second has chips of border missing and I&rsquo;m not happy at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ordered two screens the first had a yellow line in the screen. The second has chips of border missing and I&rsquo;m not happy at all. I would take a pic but it&rsquo;s on my phone smh</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="please-don-t-do-it">Please don&rsquo;t do it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not try to use this kit to do it yourself because it is terrible. Screen feels weird, tools don&rsquo;t work right. Would recommend other products before this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad customer service . Display does not work. If I could I would put no stars.</p>

<h5 id="frame-needs-work">Frame needs work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Frame is too big, thick, it is sticking out. Would not buy again.</p>

<h5 id="poor-quality-longevity">Poor quality/longevity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not even 6 months from this digitizer and the display has issue with certain stills and colors. It will reset after error if and go to black until the screen is turned off and&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">DO NOT BUY!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should have been more vigilant in reading the reviews. I was in a rush. It arrived scratched and the color temp is off.</p>
