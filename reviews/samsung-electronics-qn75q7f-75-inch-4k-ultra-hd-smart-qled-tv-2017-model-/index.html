<h5 id="gray-scale-are-better-on-the-ks8000-over-the-the-model-the">Gray Scale are better on the KS8000 ( over the the model the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this for Samsung owners who have the recent but previous Samsung KS8000 or KS9000 who may ne disappointed. This model is decent and should exceed the quality of anything pre-KS8000 though.The Q series is just a marketing change up by Samsung. Q stands for Quantum Dot technology. In fact the same dot technology Samsung has implemented in the Samsung KS series the last two years ! To be fair Samsung they did slightly improve color saturation.Black uniformity, Gray Scale are better on the KS8000 ( over the the model the Q7F which replaced the KS8000 ) ..The viewing angle on the ks8000 and Q7F are the same..69 degrees (typical for non OLED) Color saturation is ever so slightly better on the Q7F over the KS8000 as well, but not enough to make up for the Q7F inferior contrast, black uniformity, and grayscale.The Samsung KS800 hits up 1400 nits on &ldquo;peak HDR windows&rdquo; depending on the size.. The Q7F peak windows only hit just under 900 nits!.. huge difference on HDR.. On Standard Definition TV (SDR) the KS8000 hits 500 to 700 nits while the Q7F does about 500 nits max..this puts the Q7F is the same brightness range as a high end cell phone.. while the KS8000 would be noticeably brighter next to it. The Q7F looks nice and bright unless is right next to a window on a bright day.. This is where I immediately saw the difference compared to my KS8000 the Q7F didn&rsquo;t appear as bright and rich in my large well lit living room ..The Q7f and Q9F both have cheaper speakers.. not quite as good compared to the KS series&hellip;If you want the quality of a KS8000 / KS9000 you have to go buy a Q9F which thankfully does slightly exceed the KS8000/9000 in some areas (but actually does worse in contrast, grayscale, and black uniformity). Furthermore the Q7F &amp; Q97 cost much more then last years counterparts.. despite the Q7F not even exceeding the older set it replaced. The Samsung Q7F is Samsungs &ldquo;replacement for the KS8000&hellip; and it falls short in many categories while costing more then the KS8000.. A 65inch Samsung KS8000 was $1800 versus the Samsung Q7F 65 inch for $4000&hellip;Why would samsung do this you ask? IMHO, Many professional reviewers previously recommended purchasing the KS8000 over the top end KS9000 because the KS8000 was so good the price difference wasn&rsquo;t worth it. Samsung saw this undercut the KS9000 flagship sales. This time the top brass at Samsung made sure the top end model ( Q97) could not even be &ldquo;compared&rdquo; to their midrange.. by discontinuing the KS series and renaming quantum dot tech as QLED and putting Q designations in the tv name. Unlike the KS8000 &hellip;The Q7F is not even close to the Q97&hellip; The Q7F is not close to the KS8000.. bad move Samsung.. I expected it to be slighter better or at least match it..The consumer loses.. the quality of the new flagship the Q97 barely beats the KS9000 and still the KS9000 beats the Q97 in contrast, black uniformity, speaker quality and a few other areas&hellip; The Samsung Q7F is a poor replacement for the KS8000.. the only one areas where the Q7F and Q9F are slightly better then the KS series is color saturation.. but its not eye popping for the huge price difference.. The end result is the new flagship ( Q9F) is ever so slightly better then the KS series while costing much more. The Q7F is also more then the KS8000 while being inferior to it in all areas except color saturation. Which again I noticed but I wasn&rsquo;t like &ldquo;wow, I gotta have it&rdquo; &hellip; in fact again as I said above, first thing I noticed was the brightness of the screen wasn&rsquo;t as good on the Q7F.. I returned it and still using the KS8000 I have..For those holding out for another firmware update: Samsung has done one update back in March which didn&rsquo;t improve much to bring it near the KS8000 quality. Brightness still suffers as does contrast and black uniformity. Keep in mind Samsung wants to maintain the distinguishable difference between the Q7F and the Q9F, not making the mistake that hurt the KS9000 Flagship which was marginally better then the KS8000. They will never make the Q7F close to the brightness of the Q9F. The Q9F is only marginally brighter then the KS series from last year.. the Q7F gets to suffer. There was a firmware update but it didn&rsquo;t increase the nits.</p>

<h5 id="updated-post-now-i-am-happy">Updated Post&hellip;.Now I am happy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated&hellip;. I have to change my rating to 5 stars. After many hours of playing with the settings and looking at my different media sources, I tracked down the cause of the pixilation. I never had a problem before because I was using a plasma, how I wish they could make 4k plasma. Turns out one of my media sources, Rasberry PI 3, Was throwing off the Frame rate and causing the pixilation. After a bit of playing and changing a setting on my &ldquo;Pi&rdquo; to refresh the frame rate with each content change, all looks good now. Still not a plasma for motion, but Led/lcd/oled never will be and I have accepted that. Could not be happier with picture quality. Just Remember when setting up your TV for novices, you don&rsquo;t want colors and contrast that is not true to life, you will be much Happier with your TV. If anyone wants me to post my settings, please let me know. All colors have been calibrated thru expert setup (Red/greens/blue/cyan/magenta,white balance, etc&hellip;)So far the Jury is out&hellip; Have all my color calibrated under expert settings, and all the experts recommended settings. I have to say the color and picture is incredible. BUT, and this is a big one, so far the motion is not up to &ldquo;par&rdquo; for the price of the TV. I am getting lots of pixilation with motion, some may call it blur, but looks more like pixilation effect to me. I am not sure if this is something wrong with the tv, or my setup. I have tried many different settings and will continue to play with them. If anyone from Samsung wants to chime in and help, that would be great. I have 30 days to return this tv, if I can not improve the motion blur it may go back for a different model. So far the 3 stars is a Temporary review and can always be changed.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-75-lcd">Very good 75&rdquo; LCD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> with added ARC info. See the end of the review.You have to start any review of the Q7F by recognizing that it only makes sense as a 75&rdquo; proposition. At smaller sizes, LG&rsquo;s OLED TV&rsquo;s are simply better. When I was looking to upgrade from my (still excellent) 60&rdquo; Pioneer Kuro plasma I wanted both 4K and a 75&rdquo; screen. That put the OLED&rsquo;s out of reach (the 77&rdquo; LG OLED is still running ~ $20k at most locales). The Q7F was the next best choice for me and it&rsquo;s a very good television.Pros:&ndash; Bright, vivid color&ndash; Great HDR10 performance&ndash; Sharp&ndash; Great build quality&ndash; Tiny bezel (though I wish it were black instead of silver!)&ndash; Decent built-in speaker&ndash; Fiber cable with remote control electronics is more convenient that trying to plug HDMI&rsquo;s directly into the TVCons:&ndash; Out of the box picture settings are not very good&ndash; Hard to find information on exactly what some of the picture processing options actually do&ndash; Vertical ghosting can occur with bright images on a black background&ndash; Letterboxes&rsquo;s can show some ghosting&ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t get ARC to work with my AVR but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a Q7 issue or a problem with my AVRI have found it very tricky to find optimal settings for picture quality on this TV. The suggestions at RTings.com are a very good starting point for Movie mode. This is what I use for both UHD blu-rays and for most HD programming. On baseball broadcasts Movie mode renders grass that actually looks like it could grow on the earth. In every other mode (Natural, Standard, Dynamic) grass looks like an irradiated plant from Avatar. And the default sharpening setting on these modes is far too aggressive for HD programming. It results in a strange, harsh picture that isn&rsquo;t watchable at all. Turning the sharpening down or off helps enormously &ndash; I keep it completely off in Movie mode.But oddly, Movie mode is quite terrible for streaming UHD video on Amazon or Netflix using the built-in apps. No explanation for this but Movie mode has a creepy yellowish cast with streaming video that looks completely different than it does with UHD disks. Natural mode (with less sharpening and contrast enhancement turned off) looks better (actually really, really good) with streaming 4k video. Some picture adjustments like LCD Clear Motion are fairly useless &ndash; this one inserts black frames but causes flicker and really kills the brightness to unacceptable levels. And speaking of motion it&rsquo;s wise to get the motion settings off of Auto and tone down the Judder reduction unless you really like that soap-opera/video tape look. I don&rsquo;t but I also don&rsquo;t turn the motion interpolation completely off. I leave it on custom because when it&rsquo;s off I do see some judder in fast-moving scenes. Very different from my plasma which was always perfect in this regard. With a touch of judder reduction (I do leave blur at max) the motion is smooth and I see only a hint of soap-opera weirdness.If you can ignore the light bleeding into the letterboxes the actual performance of the TV with good source material is outstanding. Black levels are really, really good. Colors are detailed and rich. If you keep that $#! contrast enhancement off you can really get a lot of detail in dark scenes. The &lsquo;enhancement&rsquo; just crushes everything to solid black but fortunately it can be turned off.I do not see major fading with off-axis viewing in my setup. Viewing angles in my room really don&rsquo;t get that wide &ndash; maybe 30deg max so it&rsquo;s not being stressed. But the idea that the TV will washout if you&rsquo;re just a hair off axis is not right. It looks roughly the same from every viewing position in my room.Overall, the picture quality is short of an OLED (or even a plasma) but it&rsquo;s very, very good. Some 4K UHD content is simply stunning. And for 75&rdquo; it&rsquo;s more realistically priced than the stratospheric OLED pricing for big panels.ARC UpdateI was finally able to get ARC working with the built-in streaming apps. There were 2 issues. First, only HDMI 2 supports ARC. Apparently this is a known Samsung thing but it surprised me. Second, it took several attempts at connected my AVR to the QF7 before it recognized it as a receiver that supports ARC. Once that happened, the audio selector had a new &lsquo;Receiver&rsquo; option in addition to TV &amp; Optical. This is only a minor issue &ndash; before I figured it out I was using an optical Toslink cable to get audio for streaming apps. Some Amazon content does support Dolby Digital+ though, which can&rsquo;t stream over Toslink. So it&rsquo;s satisfying that I was able to get this working even if it won&rsquo;t make much difference in practice.</p>
