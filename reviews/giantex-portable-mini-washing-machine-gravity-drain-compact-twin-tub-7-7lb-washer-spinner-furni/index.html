<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For less then $100 its been GREAT so far. Ive only had it for about 2 weeks (used about 8 times). To give you an idea of how much it holds I can usually fit 6 large mens t-shirts in one load comfortably. I usually split loads in half before spin drying them. This feature also works GREAT gets clothes about 70% dry.TIPS:-DO NOT use a lot of detergent <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of your detergent cap is more then enough usually.-The hose for water inlet did not fit my sinks just brought it to home depot asked for help bought 2 adapters one turns kitchen sink to garden hose size and the other a male garden hose nipple adapter that fits the hose perfectly spent about $5 on each. Pictures attached.-Would also advise you to buy 1 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch anti slip pads for bottom of machine if using on countertop or on a slick surface. It keeps machine in place and helps reduce noise spent $2 on the set of 4. Pictures attached.-Lastly buy a floating lint catcher online $2.50 attach it to a string put it in at water level and attach it to a small suction cup on the outside of the machine to keep it from sinking in the machine (the floating part of the lint catcher doesn&rsquo;t work that well). Pictures attached.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received my unit today and could not wait to put it to use. The product was ready to use right out of the box; I set mine up on my kitchen counter, to allow water to drain into my sink. Washing is very simple (fortunately my inlet hose fits my faucet&hellip;barely) and I didn&rsquo;t have any issues with the unit moving around or making a mess. Draining is also simple. I used the spinner before and after rinsing, and each time. I had to stand on a step ladder and hold the unit down as I sure it would have eventually vibrated off my counter top. The spin cycle also creates loud vibrations that I&rsquo;m sure my neighbors can hear, but I don&rsquo;t mind as my neighbors tend to be loud and inconsiderate anyway. I&rsquo;m most impressed with the efficacy of the spinner; on a 3 minute setting, my laundry came out slightly damp.I am very happy with my purchase. It&rsquo;s obviously a more time consuming process than using a standard washer/dryer, but I can honestly say my laundry came out just as clean!I gave this product <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars because the rubber gasket inside the washing tub has already broken. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t cause problems later.</p>

<h5 id="surprisingly-good-although-the-spin-cycle-shakes-the-machine-to-much">Surprisingly good, although the spin cycle shakes the machine to much.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this with the intention of using it to wash all the handwash only items I have that I use for work and by the end of the week. I can&rsquo;t justify sticking 5 shirts into a wash cycle in a traditional washer, it wastes too much energy.That being said this washer definitely does the trick, it washes well, is surprisingly powerful, and is easy to use and operate. What I didn&rsquo;t like is that the spin cycle makes the washer shake all over the floor. I have to put in one small item at a time to be able to make the machine stay put. Although, the spin cycle leaves your clothes incredibly dry since it&rsquo;s so powerful. So, it&rsquo;s good and bad in that sense.I would recommend this washer if you are able to keep it somewhere where it won&rsquo;t move around too much. You&rsquo;re also able to just dump water into the tub, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to use the water hose it comes with (I found this easier to do).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-does-exactly-what-its-advertised-to-do-and-does-it-well">It does exactly what its advertised to do and does it well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, I&rsquo;d like to put out there that there is a bit of a learning curve to this thing. I mean I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; at this like, &ldquo;yea ok chick&hellip; it&rsquo;s got like 4 parts to it.&rdquo; Yes, agreed there is not much to figure out in terms of just using it. But HOW to position it, how to make the hose work for your sink/shower, where to place it&hellip;. etc.. these are the growing pains of this product.Positives:It&rsquo;s bigger than it may present on Amazon. But it isn&rsquo;t so big that you&rsquo;re wondering where you&rsquo;re going to keep it. I live in a thimble and this fits well in my bathroom. It holds a whole load of children&rsquo;s clothes, a hefty amount of undies and socks, shirts - (5-6 womens/ 3-4 mens), 2-3 pairs of jeans, or a medium sized fleece blanket. (which I know from personal experience because my cat had a hairball on my blanket.) The amount it washes is great for in-between laundry hauls. (Actually minimizes the need for such hauls). It washes everything well and things come out actually clean. (Yay, hairball be gone). The spinner while a bit small (more on that later) is a mighty lil thing. I typically will drain the machine, take pieces out and wring them well before placing in the spinner. After spinning they come out damp (close to dry) and then I hang them for a few hours. If I do a few loads in the late morning/ early afternoon, they&rsquo;re dry by the evening. For all yall with small apartments tryna figure out how to manage all of this here is my advice: Purchase this along with an over the door drying rack so that when you&rsquo;re finished washing and spinning, you hang your stuff and it&rsquo;s out of the way. Then when the clothes are dry, take them down and fold up the rack. Rack remains out of the way and clothes are dry. &gt;:) Additionally for positives I liked how there are different settings in case you wanna get creative. The washing times range from 3 mins to 15. I rarely need 15. Even hairball blanket only took 6. For the spinner it only goes up to 5 mins but 3 is usually fine. If u need more crank that thing up again. Plus it&rsquo;s fun to watch all the water come out of the clothes when spinning, But that&rsquo;s just a personal preference.Negatives:Welp, my main gripe is that the cord is exceptionally short. SHORT! You gotta put this thing directly under a dang outlet. So, it was definitely a challenge tryna work out positioning. Think of it this way, washer needs to be accessible to outlet, faucet (water source) and place to drain. Hoses are SHORT cord is SHORT. Speaking of hose, the water in hose doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit most sinks/ showers. For a while I was using a large pail to pour water in until i realized I could just hold the hose in place at my bathroom sink. But the draining, OH the draining. I still need that pail because the cord is too short to put the machine in the tub and drain it that way and have it still reach the outlet. Mind you the outlet isn&rsquo;t that far away. I make do. Noise level- well it kinda depends and it kinda doesn&rsquo;t. Picky moody neighbors might complain about the low vibrational sound they hear. The spinner is the most vibrational. I try to do my stuff in the late morning/afternoon so that people don&rsquo;t act foolish. Last negative - the spinner (which I love overall by the way) is super small so things need to be dried in shifts. Don&rsquo;t be cute (like I thought I was) and overload it. It makes a horrific banging noise and shouts expletives. Not charming.All-in-all: It washes things when you can&rsquo;t stand the thought of trekking to the laundromat, dealing with people, finding gum and/or chewed up sunflower seeds in machines etc&hellip; You can wash essentials while cooking dinner or other things around the house. It&rsquo;s kinda cute and fun. But it has its structural shortcomings which are trade offs cuz you can&rsquo;t have it all. Cheers!READ MORE</p>
