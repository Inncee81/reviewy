<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="the-good-the-bad-the-review">The good, the bad, the review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, this is similar to, but not a rebranded Nest cam. I did a side by side and the Nest 1080 has a wider angle lens. Saying that, the Yi 1080 is a very nice picture and the app is pretty good. The Nest, you need a computer to set it up, the Yi, just an app. The Nest comes with a mounting base (small round plastic piece) so you can hang it on a wall or ceiling. Yi does not. However, the Yi does fit into my old Nest base perfectly. Saying that, the Yi camera itself does NOT fit tightly into holder as the Yi camera is a smaller diameter than the Nest. The Nest allows you to drop some code into your website pages so you can offer a public live stream. The Yi does not. Having them both, here&rsquo;s how I sum it up, if you need a live stream, a wider angle lens, and you don&rsquo;t mind plugging up your computer for setup and changes, spend the money and get the Nest 1080p. If you just want to privately monitor your home or biz, easy app only setup, and you don&rsquo;t need a super wide lens (the Yi is still a wide angle, just not as wide as the Nest) get the Yi 1080p.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-camera-for-small-price">Awesome camera for small price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a camera that I could point out my front window. I didn&rsquo;t want to worry about wires and my upload speed is too slow for most anyway. This camera stores to an SD card so no worries. The picture I shot is with the morning sun coming thru the window so there&rsquo;s a slight reflection. I get alerts so I can check from wherever I am. All in all I&rsquo;m totally pleased.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-inexpensive-and-reliable-wifi-security-cam">The best inexpensive and reliable Wifi Security Cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like the YI 1080p Home Security Cam. It came in a little box. Its very compact Security Cam. After install the App in my smartphone only took me 2 minutes to connect it to my wifi network. Its very easy going to use it. Day light videos are colorful with good details in 1080p (HD) also can change to 720p (SD Standard Def.)It works perfect. I install a 32GB micro sd for recording and works perfect. Night vision its limited but reliable. There are some accessories to install it outdoor so I will try later with one of those. Love you can turn off the LED so no one think its on.I have another WIFI cam from Tao&hellip;.but arrived DOA. They sent a replacement but the App its more difficult to understand.PRO:1. Easy to install2. Very easy App for Android3. Very clear 1080p videos4. Notifications works nice5. You can select a specific area to monitor and alert you.CONS:1. No weather sealed2. Limited Night visionI will buy the black 720p for my backyard. I also have the YI Dash Cam in my car and work awesome. YI electronics are inexpensive and very reliable.</p>

<h5 id="great-inexpensive-security-camera-with-easy-setup">Great inexpensive security camera with easy setup!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to monitor our front door while away on a trip. Delivery of the item was on time and I got it set up on my android phone in less than a half hour. We bought a 32GB micro SD card for it and positioned the camera to view outside the office window towards our front porch and the picture is very clear at all times of the day! I am able to receive the alerts and view them from my phone and/or laptop. I am also able to view more than the 6 second clip if I want to watch the full footage of the movement. It is easy to save the 6 second clip to the SD card; however it doesn&rsquo;t save the full footage. But I found out that if I leave that clip in that day&rsquo;s activities then I can still view the footage. I have set both the sensitivity and alert frequency settings to low and it still picks up passing vehicles but I am okay with that since I am able to delete the unneeded clips easily. I am amazed and pleased that I can be hundreds of miles away and still be able to monitor my front porch. And it&rsquo;s considerably cheaper than the Ring or Nest products. I am very pleased with this product!!!</p>

<p>Good camera, im using it with a 64GB SD card, its been almost a week since I installed it and the card still has over 20GB free space.The seller is a pain in the @ss emailing daily begging for feedback.</p>

<h5 id="warning-critical-date-timestamp-issue"><strong>WARNING</strong> CRITICAL DATE / TIMESTAMP ISSUE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: after leaving a negative review here, YI Support replied back explaining that the video file date/time goes by UTC time rather than local time as it should be. I originally emailed their support but did not get an explanation. Additionally, there is no date/timestamp on the video itself which I think is kinda important and needs to be added.My Yi camera captured a crime occuring outside my house over a period of several hours so the police arrived asking for a copy of the footage. I removed the SD card and inserted it into my computer so that I can copy the files off it. I discovered that not only do the video files lack a date/timestamp but the date/time on the files themselves in explorer show an incorrect time of when they were created. The ONLY way to see a correct timeline is by logging into the app which means I would have to give the police my login information so they can stream the footage online (which would not only be extremely tedious for them, but I would be giving them full access to everything I&rsquo;ve ever recorded including current live video/audio feed from my house). I emailed Yi support and got a response several days later (as they have no number to call) and they offered NO HELP. their response was that &ldquo;there MAY be a bug that would be possibly corrected in a later firmware update&rdquo;. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE coming from a company that creates a security product like this. How am I supposed to submit this into evidence? Needless to say, I&rsquo;m going to change the system out for something else.</p>
