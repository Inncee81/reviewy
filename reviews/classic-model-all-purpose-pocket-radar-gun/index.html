<h5 id="great-for-coaching-softball-pitchers">Great for coaching softball pitchers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I coach middle school and high school softball pitchers and needed something that I could use to measure their pitching speed. I needed it to be something that I could hold in one hand, while I catch the pitches in my glove. I heard about the pocket radar, and saw the positive reviews so I decided to see it it met my needs. I received it on Friday and on Sunday I want to a local clinic where I knew I could compare it to the more expensive juggs brand guns that they use there.I had no problems getting reliable measurements right away using the pocked radar. Just like the instructions said, press and release the red button while the pitcher is in her windup. The speed measurements I got were all within 0-2 mph of the ones that the coaches were getting on their juggs guns. Only a couple of times did I not get a measurement, and I felt that most times it was my fault as I didn&rsquo;t push the button at the right time. I do agree that the button is a bit &ldquo;mushy&rdquo;, but it did work very well. A button where I could feel the click, might be a bit better.I was able to get measurements standing behind the catcher, or off to the side a bit, but it seemed that the best way to use it was if you were catching the ball with one hand, and measuring speed with the other. I do think that this might not be very useful for measuring speeds from to far away or at large angles. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s designed for those needs.If you are a coach or a father who wants to monitor your daughter&rsquo;s pitching speed, you&rsquo;ll most likely like the pocket radar. Mine came in a nice strong case with batteries and a wrist strap. The batteries seemed a bit worn out as indicated by the battery indicator on the pocket radar screen, but other than that I am very happy with it.</p>

<h5 id="skeptical-at-first-now-very-pleased">Skeptical at first&hellip;Now very pleased&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to help train my daughter&rsquo;s pitching, as having measurable results helps motivate her. I used one of the speed radars that you stick on the back of a glove for a while. I hated using it because while it was fairly consistent with fast balls coming right down the target line, it didn&rsquo;t work well with any other pitch that required the ball to spin and move. Plus, comparing the glove radar to actual radar guns, it was consistently 3-6MPH slower than the guns.I read some reviews for this Pocket Radar and decided to give it a try.Out the box, you get everything you need to get started, including a protection case. While the case works, its a bit bulky for me to lug around in my pocket. Buying a belt holster (any cell phone holster that this will fit in) remedied that problem. Also, the company that makes this radar gun sells a holster specifically for this gun.Right away, I went around driving on cruise control at different speeds, measuring the speed against stationary objects next to the road. I did this for about 30 minutes, each time coming dead on with what my speedometer read.Afterwards, I took my daughter to practice her pitching. One of the local high school coaches was there with their JUGGZ radar guns. We decided to try them side by side, as he was curious about the small gun at the $200 price range. Side by side, both guns read the same reading with the exception of 3 times. 2 times, the pocket radar read 1 mph slower and 1 time it read 1 mph faster. Either way, it was withing its +/- 1 MPH tolerance.Using it was easy, as I was able to figure out the timing from the first pitch. Holding the gun with one hand and having a glove on the other is no problem, regardless of what pitch was being thrown. On the rise or drop, I held the gun to the side of the glove. On a curve or screw, I held the gun above the glove.This radar has been perfect and has really given my daughter motivation to not only increase the speed of her fastball, but slow the speed of her change up. It has also shown her how her speed on certain pitches were a little slower than her fastball. This now motivated her to throw a little harder on those pitches.Overall, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this product, especially at it&rsquo;s pricepoint. Having great customer service behind it is icing on the cake. If you have any hesitations on buying it because of it&rsquo;s accuracy, don&rsquo;t wait any longer. There&rsquo;s really no reason for anyone short of being a professional athlete or coach to need anything more than this&hellip; unless you like wasting your money.</p>

<h5 id="pocket-radar-speed-reading">pocket radar speed reading</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I pointed the pocket radar at my wall and read 15 mph. Couldn&rsquo;t get consistent reading. Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this product. I had others try it to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t me. They had same problem. Pointed at a solid object and got readings!I would like to update my review. I was surprised to get a quick response from the president of pocket radar. He addressed a problem that I might be having and offered to give further help and if necessary a replacement. Customer service is surprising and very welcome. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this for our pitching lessons. Took a minute to figure out how to use. Face screen to your face when catching. Its really compact, which is great for carrying around, and seems right on as far as accuracy. Excited about this product</p>

<p>Love it. Very small and discreet so pitchers and fans can&rsquo;t even tell you are checking pitching speeds.</p>

<h5 id="inconspicuous-and-accurate-for-softball">Inconspicuous and accurate for softball</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked this up for measuring the speed of my daughters pitch in softball (12&rdquo; balls). The results are consistent and fairly accurate. I&rsquo;ve been very impressed with this. My only complaint is that you need to get the timing right to take the reading of a pitch.There was someone on here who complained about the accuracy compared to their car, car speedometers can be off by as much as 10% even when new so I would take a speedometer reading with a grain of salt.</p>

<h5 id="catch-those-speeders-in-your-community">catch those speeders in your community</h5>

<p>Bought this to capture speeders through our condo community. Works well. I suggest recording it with a phone/camera. Hold down the button for pulsing real-time speeds.</p>

<p>Works great. I&rsquo;ve tested it against the speedometer in my car and it always measures the same as the speedometer or within one mile-per-hour of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-with-some-minor-inconveniences">Great product with some minor inconveniences</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for the money. Minor nitpicks in that it will frequently pick up someones arm instead of the ball. It can also be a little tedious to time when to hold the button.</p>
