<h5 id="my-horrible-squaretrade-experience">My Horrible SquareTrade Experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Horrible SquareTrade Experience:I purchased a Dell UltraSharp U2414H 23.8&rdquo; Inch Screen LED Monitor through Amazon on July 16, 2016. I added a SquareTrade 3-Year PC Peripherals Protection Plan ($200-$250). The monitor developed a screen problem, a thin &ldquo;dead&rdquo; line running across it noticeable when scrolling up and down.SquareTrade 3-Year PC Peripherals Protection Plan ($200-$250)After contacting SquareTrade via Amazon, I received a response on Sep. 30 requesting my warranty information. I received email instructions to call &ldquo;Finn&rdquo; at 1-877-927-7268.On Wed., Oct 12 I called SquareTrade at 10:30 AM. After 37 minutes on hold listening to muzak I was connected to Daniel Johnson (Claims). After explaining my situation, he transferred me to Sam (Computers), after a wait on hold for another 16 minutes. Sam transferred me to Eddie (Electronics) after being on hold for another 13 minutes.Eddie informed me that my monitor was still under warranty by Dell, that I needed to contact Dell first for warranty coverage (1-800-624-9897). Eddie transferred me to Dell.After answering many questions as to the monitor&rsquo;s providence, Dell informed me that the monitor was built 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days ago and was no longer covered under Dell&rsquo;s one-year warranty. I was advised to contact Amazon. (At this point, I had over 3 hours invested this morning in this quixotic quest, and counting.)I called Amazon, spoke with Tiffany. She told me Amazon only warranties this purchase for 30-days after purchase (which I learned when this circular firing squad began weeks ago). She told me it &ldquo;should be&rdquo; covered under my SquareTrade contract, that I &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t have to&rdquo; go through this ordeal. She advised that I call SquareTrade. I told her once again that I&rsquo;d been there, done that, and here I am. She promised that she&rsquo;d email SquareTrade about this situation. I told her that I WILL NOT respond to SquareTrade&rsquo;s request to call them AGAIN only to waste hours on hold only to begin this circular firing squad all over again. She said she&rsquo;d request that THEY call ME. I told her &ldquo;When the phone doesn&rsquo;t ring I&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s SquareTrade.&ldquo;UPDATE: Oct 20, 2016SquareTrade never contacted me per Amazon&rsquo;s request. I had been advised by Amazon to give SquareTrade two business days to reply. When three had passed without a word from SquareTrade I called and spoke with Amazon again. The gentleman I spoke with couldn&rsquo;t understand why everyone was giving me such a hard time, such a run-around. He simply processed a full replacement, shipped it one-day delivery. It arrived today. I set it up and it seems to be running perfectly. Sheesh, what an ordeal, but thank you to the last Amazon customer support guy for restoring my faith in Amazon. I even reactivated my Amazon Prime membership, which I had dropped after last week&rsquo;s run-around.I have just requested a full refund from SquareTrade. I&rsquo;ll update here when/if I receive a response, or if I need to pursue that further as well.UPDATE: Oct 21, 2016SquareTrade just sent me an email with a link &ldquo;How to File a Claim.&rdquo; Like everything else about them so far, their link does not work.</p>

<h5 id="i-was-duped-don-t-be-me">I was DUPED. Don&rsquo;t be me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Misleading. I bought it for my Kindle, with assumption that &ldquo;Accidental Damage from Handling&rdquo; (ADH) was part of the deal. I never would have purchased had I known that I was only buying an extra year of coverage for manufacturing defects. I would have taken the risk that, if there was a defect with my Kindle, said defect would present itself within a year.The product page on Amazon does NOT expressly state that ADH is not covered &ndash; this is only stated in a PDF of terms and conditions only available in the linked PDF. This is a 4,077-word contract crammed into 2 pages. The exclusion of ADH is mentioned in the middle of the first column of the second page (see photo attached).Of course, the Amazon product page doesn&rsquo;t expressly say that accidental damage IS covered. If you, as I did, miss the link to the Standard Terms and Conditions, you might, as I did, go to the SquarePage website to check it out. You might, as I did, click on the top of the page describing its coverage of &ldquo;Tablets/E-Readers.&rdquo; Note that the first feature it lists is that the policy covers drops and spills. You might, as I did, read that and conclude, as I did, that you&rsquo;d be covered you if you accidentally drop or spill something on your stupid Kindle.Now I&rsquo;ve busted the thing, and I realize I&rsquo;ve been played for a fool. Well played, SquareTrade. Well played.</p>

<h5 id="thought-i-did-a-good-thing-by-getting-a-10-dollar-warranty-with-a">Thought I did a good thing by getting a 10 dollar warranty with a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thought I did a good thing by getting a 10 dollar warranty with a router I had purchased on Amazon, as it was suggested to me on the bottom. When the router finally died after less than a year, like most linksys routers do, I went to file my claim and was told that because it was manufacturer refurbished, I was out of luck. Kinda bizarre that it would be suggested with the purchase, but the purchase was ineligible.I&rsquo;ll never get another extended warranty, a lot of weird stipulations and loopholes for them to get out of the claim. I thought I could trust a big name such as square trade, however they&rsquo;re just as deceitful as most.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-bother">Don&rsquo;t Bother</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never given one star but I just have to with this. I was supposed to get it December 28, it&rsquo;s January 18 and I still haven&rsquo;t gotten it. Don&rsquo;t bother with this item, it&rsquo;s only a dollar or two but it&rsquo;s not worth it. Customer service is horrible, and it doesn&rsquo;t cover nearly what it advertises to (I just read all of the terms). If you buy this and your item breaks they&rsquo;ll find a reason to not cover you (this is based on all the other reviews, and the very specific terms). Save yourself the stress and buy a protection plan that&rsquo;s a little more expensive. I&rsquo;m not even going to bother fighting for my dollar, you guys can keep it.</p>

<p>SCAM im sorry i didnt read the reviews before i added this it wasnt a lot of money but UNREAL trying to file a claim against a piece of JUNK trackball no longer working and stupid me paid for another one on another mouse i purchased yesterday if i end up returning the mouse they better refund my extra $5.00</p>

<h5 id="not-covered">Not Covered??</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for a Lynskys E 45 00 router and an adapter. I bought it a couple months ago, filled out, sent in. I just went to hook up the router this week and had a few problems. I went on Linskys on line chat for help. I gave them my serial numbers etc. I was told, very rudely, that my products were out of warranty and I did not deserve to chat for free with Linsys. No, this Square Deal Warranty wasn&rsquo;t rude to me, but because they didn&rsquo;t show my coverage I was treated terribly by Linskys. (that obviously is for a different review). But, it is Square Trades fault for not covering me correctly. I wasted 2 hours on this one issue. A total waste of my money.</p>
