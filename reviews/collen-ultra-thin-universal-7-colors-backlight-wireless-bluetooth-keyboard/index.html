<h5 id="i-love-this-little-keyboard">I love this little keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this little keyboard. When it arrived, I was a little skeptical because the &ldquo;e&rdquo; key clicked weird. I jiggled it a little and that fixed it. This keyboard is exactly the width of IPad Air/Air2/Pro 9.7. It also attaches magnetically to the Ipad if you have a Smart Cover installed. Just place it on the top of the Smart Cover and it holds pretty well. The back is aluminum, the top is plastic. The keys have a good feel to them and have a backlight you can turn off or on (also has 3 levels of key brightness!). Additionally, the top &ldquo;function key&rdquo; row has different functions for IOS- brightness, home screen, search, safari, play/pause/forward/back, and volume control. There is also a &ldquo;Lock&rdquo; button that turns your ipad off. This keyboard was designed to work with computers with bluetooth as well as android tablets, though I haven&rsquo;t tried it with one. I got the gold one because my air 2 is gold and it matches great. Overall, I would highly recommend this keyboard to anyone with an ipad who wants a slim, lightweight, portable keyboard that&rsquo;s easy to type on!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-look-poor-perfotmance">Great Look/Poor Perfotmance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really excited when I received this keyboard. It looked really nice, was lightweight and compact.The instructions were difficult to read, had typos and it took quite some time to pair the keyboard with a IOS device and then with a Windows device.I had difficulty in determining how to turn on the backlight. There were 7 color choices as well. After contacting the seller and waiting days for a response, I was able to turn on the light. I could barely see that the keys were lit even in a room without any light. Even worse, the keyboard lighting was totally inconsistent and there were sections that weren&rsquo;t out at all.Additionally, I also had to contact the seller because several keys did not work at all. The seller then wanted to know what keys and then would contact the manufacturer to see what could be done.I have invested way too much time in a product that just doesn&rsquo;t function well and have requested a refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="backlight-is-uneven-and-weak">Backlight is uneven and weak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sturdy keyboard, the size and feel of it is fine - but the backlighting is very weak and uneven. If I had bought it based on the backlight capability I&rsquo;d be returning it. For some reason Amazon will not accept the photo I tried to submit that showed how poorly several rows of keys lighted up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a perfect size with my 9.7 inch ipad, width wise. My ipad is rose gold so I kind of wish this matched, but it is still super cute. Easy to pair, and the ipad recognizes when you&rsquo;re using the external keyboard and minimizes the onscreen one. Also, some of the function keys work, like the ones to change brightness, volume, search, and lock. Tab works to go between text fields. It&rsquo;s going to take time to get used to how small it is, but it&rsquo;s super compact for on the go blogging which is exactly what I wanted it for. Time will tell how long it holds up, but it seems pretty sturdy. Charged pretty fast too, there&rsquo;s an indicator light that goes from red to green when it&rsquo;s charged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-keys-are-in-the-right-placement-for-fast-typing">All keys are in the right placement for Fast Typing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE after 1 week:Still not a bad experience! When you first turn it on there seems to be a few minutes when it needs to &ldquo;Catch Up&rdquo; or something because I notice that I will get multiple characters in a row. But after a few minutes those things go away. Seems to happen most when I first type in Outlook on the ipad. But as soon as I go to another screen, like this text box, those issues seemed to quickly go away. I find typing on this keyboard to be better than my desktop keyboard &ndash; but that one sucks! The keys here are well spaced, and in the places you would annnticipate if you are an experienced typer &ndash; especially the backspace (delete) key!Finally a keyboard that seems to work well and keeps up with my fast typing! So far I have had iit for a short period of time, but the keyboard feels great and the action is right on. Moreover, the keys are in the right spot so I dont mess up as I am typing, especially with the delete key! That is usually the key that is in the wrong spot on most keyboards. So I am very happy with this keyboard so far. I will write another review of this if later I change my mind due to some unforeseen instances.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-taking-notes-on-e-textbooks">Perfect for taking notes on e-textbooks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this so I could take longform notes in the kindle-version of my textbooks on my ipad. The Kindle app has a lot of great features for adding flash cards, taking notes, etc. but they&rsquo;re a pain to use when you&rsquo;re tapping it out on the touch screen. This solved that problem, and it even saved the day once when my laptop died and I had to take notes on my phone. It looks cute, is super light and easy to throw in your bag, and incredibly intuitive to use. The setup is easy, the connection is just like any bluetooth accessory, and it&rsquo;s got a couple cool buttons made specifically for use with the iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-keyboard">Great keyboard.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This keyboard works great and has a lot of cool features to use with Android, Windows and iOS. I however have only tried the iOS features. I can lock and unlock my iPad Pro, prompt music to play (also pause, next, previous), the mute and volume buttons are on top just like on the Mac keyboard, screen shots and brightness. I&rsquo;m sure there is more that i have yet to explore. Now to the bad. The backlight is so uneven and therefore that feature is worthless. I don&rsquo;t even bother tuning it on. I have not noticed any lag at all. Also another negative is that there is a slightly convex to the whole keyboard and has no rubber grips at the bottom. I did love that it attaches by the magnet on my Smart Cover. All in all i don&rsquo;t regret my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-keyboard-1">GREAT KEYBOARD!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK. So I am using this keyboard with an iPad mini 4. First, beautiful color!!! Second, I am currently typing this review with my new keyboard and I love it. Setup was sooo quick and easy. I charged it for maybe 10 minutes and it was fully charged. Little to no lag in me hitting the keys and text appearing on the screen. Super quick and easy. I actually currently have both on my lap and the keyboard sits great and is just large enough to accommodate my hands and make it really easy to type. I also really like that the keyboard is independent from a case so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about trying to find a single surface large enough for both. Overall just really love this keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nope">Nope.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s lasted about a week then it completely stopped working. Cute, but not worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stopped-working-after-2-months">Stopped working after 2 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked decent for like 2 months and now the keyboard doesn&rsquo;t work at all. Lights up for a second and then does nothing. Very frustrated</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-on-the-go">Good for on the go</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a keyboard for my ipad, something that i can take with me but not weigh down my bag. This keyboard covers it all- easy to hook up, very light, stays connected, and it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="second-time-i-have-bought-this-because-i-love-the-rose-gold-case">Second time I have bought this because I love the rose gold case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with this is that after only a short time having it. The C and a few other letters in that area &ldquo;stick&rdquo; and I get multiple C&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="higher-quality-than-expected-very-thin-and-light-keyboard">Higher quality than expected - very thin and light keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made BT keyboard better quality than I expected based on amazon reviews. The keys feel like brushed metal and are all very even in the keyboard shell.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very nicely with my iPad.</p>

<h5 id="love-that-the-keyboard-lights-are-different-colors">Love that the keyboard lights are different colors</h5>

<p>Convenient and sleek. Cute in copper. Love that the keyboard lights are different colors</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="backlight-very-poor-battery-life-terrible">Backlight very poor, battery life terrible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this keyboard after considering it for quite a while. There are many comparable options available, and I own a few bluetooth and wireless keyboards.</p>

<p>I love this keyboard!!! Fantastic, easy to use. Amazing. Quick ship!</p>
