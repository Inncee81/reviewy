<h5 id="perfect-price-and-quality-5-5">Perfect price and quality! <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for spares for my Hero 2. Package came quickly and nicely bubble wrapped for protection. If you go to a big box store, you will see that spare batteries go for $20 a piece! I have quickly found after purchasing my GP that all GP branded items are extremely high priced. Does that mean better quality? Eh, probably not. So of course, I did as any bargain hunting American did, I went to the internet to do my shopping.I use a Sony 32GB SD, latest FW from GP website and the LCD backpack. I have been getting about 45-50min out of a full battery with the LCD on, I use it constantly so I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to try without but I would assume it could do every bit of an hour if not more. To me, that seems like a pretty decent deal for $20, especially coming with 2 batteries ( I have three total including the original.) This way I can always have 1 charging, 1 in use and 1 extra for switching in between.Now, the charger feels like a $20 charger but gets the job done right. It has fold out US prongs from the back and a European adapter for trips abroad. It also comes with a car charger, that does take a bit longer to fully charge a battery (it seems like maybe 30-35min or so.) The LED on the front is a orange-ish green color when its charging and turns completely green.Overall, I would not hesitate to buy again or recommend to a friend, it works exactly how its suppose to and is very cheap!</p>

<h5 id="looser-is-not-necessarily-better">Looser is not necessarily better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this kit just a few days ago and have used each of the batteries once and the wall charger for all batteries, including the one that came with my GoPro Hero2. Here are my observations:The wall charger: Works pretty much as intended, but mine has an odd tendency for the green LED to remain on while charging. The amount of output seems to vary, so the resulting light between the red and green can vary from yellowish to orangeish colors. If I wiggle the battery around in the charger the color also flickers. It&rsquo;s a minor issue, since a fully charged battery does glow solid green, and I&rsquo;m not going to worry about it much. I am knocking a half star off my rating though.Battery life: the batteries do last longer than the original, as they are rated at 1400mAh compared to the 1100mAh of the GoPro battery. However, both original and Wasabi batteries drain much faster that what GoPro advertises. I have seen similar issues reported all over the &lsquo;net. I am getting about 80 minutes out of the original and 100 out of the Wasabi. So&hellip; with three batteries (2 Wasabi + 1 GoPro) I can get about 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours of recording time, which matches the recording time of the 32GB card I&rsquo;m using. It&rsquo;s silly to have to stop and switch batteries three times during a long mountain biking event, especially if I&rsquo;m in a race, but at least I can get footage without having to worry about stopping and starting the camera during key moments.Battery fit: A lot of other reviews praise the Wasabi batteries for being easier to install and remove from inside the GoPro. That&rsquo;s not a good thing, it&rsquo;s a bad thing. One problem with GoPro Hero is that the audio recording is adversely affected by numerous sources of rattling, both external (mounting clips) and internal (loose power/mode and shutter buttons). I got both of these sources of rattling somewhat silenced, but now there&rsquo;s another one&hellip; the batteries! The tight fit of the GoPro original battery means it won&rsquo;t move around inside the unit. The Wasbai ones move around. Shake the unit with one installed and you can hear it. It doesn&rsquo;t sound very loud, but the mic picks it up and amplifies it inside the waterproof case. I solved this by wrapping some electrical tape around the Wasabi batteries to ensure they fit (almost) as snug as the original. Fixable, yes, but this is a another half star knock on the Wasabi kit.Car charger: I haven&rsquo;t used this yet. Assuming it works properly, this will be great when I do mountain bike events longer than 4 hours where I am looping back to my car or multiday events if I am car camping.Overall: for the price, this is a very good kit that solves some of the problems with the original GoPro Hero product. However it does introduce a few new, though minor, irritations.</p>

<h5 id="good-possibly-better-overall-than-gopro-s">Good, Possibly Better Overall than GoPro&rsquo;s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update, a year after purchase: While these batteries are impressive at first, they seem to age faster than the original GoPro batteries. While I haven&rsquo;t kept careful records, I do know the temporal length of my rides, and after a year of use, the battery life on a full charge seems to have dropped by roughly 35%. While four stars might be a higher rating than these deserve, you do still get the two batteries and a recharger for far less than you&rsquo;d pay for GoPro-branded equipment, and this might still be a rational purchase. The GoPro batteries do, after all, lose performance over time, though not as quickly as these seem to.Original review: As others point out, these batteries run longer than GoPro&rsquo;s own batteries, and this package comes with a recharger so that both batteries can be charged concurrently (one in the camera, one in the charger). At least one consumer reviewer argued that it&rsquo;s not better that these batteries can be removed from the camera slightly more easily &ndash; which is true &ndash; but they still do fit snugly, and I have not experienced any interruption in recording, that is, no indication that the batteries ever lost electrical contact with the camera. The price for these batteries is less than half of what GoPro charges for its own batteries, and these come with a charger. After a while, I thought that their initial long lifetime faded with time, but I have found that the batteries do not charge fully while in the camera, so that if I quickly swap batteries (so as not to lose the camera clock setting) and put the apparently charged battery from the camera into the external recharger, it continues to charge. That might just be a quirk of my old GoPro 960 &ndash; perhaps it&rsquo;s not an issue with the newer GoPro&rsquo;s &ndash; but might be worth an experiment.</p>

<h5 id="great-package-go-pro">Great package! Go pro!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these for my goPro Hero2. Extra batteries are a must have for any GoPro and these are great. Used them tons and found them to be as long lasting as the original battery. They&rsquo;re tiny and easy to pack so I bring both in a small baggie with the charger and rotate through them with the original while the others charge. The original charges fine in this charger too, so you can use the camera while the batteries charge. The charger has plug prongs that turn in flat when not in use, another great feature. The charger also has a red light that turns green when the battery is fully charged (leaving the battery in won&rsquo;t over charge or damage it).I&rsquo;ve had these and have been using them for several years and they have held up great.I haven&rsquo;t tried the car charger adapter so can&rsquo;t comment.</p>
