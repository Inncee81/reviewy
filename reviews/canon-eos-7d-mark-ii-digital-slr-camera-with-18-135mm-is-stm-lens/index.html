<p>Superlative Sensor for Gorgeous Images
20.2 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and ISO 100–16000
The EOS 7D Mark II has a newly designed 20.2 Megapixel sensor that delivers high-resolution image files with stunning detail and impressive clarity. Optimized for low-light shooting, the EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s sensor captures images at up to ISO 16000 (expandable to H1: 25600, H2: 51200) with remarkably low noise, thanks to its improved, higher sensitivity design. Phenomenal for stills, the EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s sensor is equally up to the task for movies, delivering Full HD capture even at rates of up to 60p.</p>

<p>Dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors
The EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s sensor works seamlessly with its Dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors for advanced image processing across the board. These image processors help the EOS 7D Mark II capture up to 1090 JPEG, 31 RAW, and 19 RAW + JPEG shots in a single burst for amazing action photography. Further, they enable the camera&rsquo;s powerful image processing on-the-fly: lens aberration, variances in peripheral illumination and image distortion can all be corrected in real time thanks to the EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s Dual DIGIC 6 Image Processors.</p>

<p>Speed Improvements Across the Board</p>

<p>High speed continuous shooting up to 10.0 fps allows you to capture fast action
With a new, rugged shutter designed for 200,000 cycles, the EOS 7D Mark II can shoot up to 10 frames per second to capture all the action. With super quick AF and exposure systems complementing the shutter&rsquo;s 55 msec shutter release time lag, the EOS 7D Mark II is tailored to meet and even exceed the speed of the action. Refined mechanics like a newly designed, more efficient shutter-drive motor and a vibration dampened mirror drive mean impressive performance for high caliber image quality, fast.</p>

<p>Sophisticated Mirror Control System
The EOS 7D Mark II camera employs an advanced mirror vibration control technology that enables the camera to support its speedy, continuous shooting capabilities while ensuring great image quality. The system uses a motor to help reduce the vibrations caused by high-speed shooting. By reducing the vibrations, the camera can achieve accurate and precise autofocus to provide steady and clear action shots at up to 10.0 frames per second.</p>

<p>Brilliant, Speedy AF Tracking
65-point* all cross-type AF system for high-performance, accurate subject tracking with EV -3 sensitivity (center point) for focusing in extreme low-light conditions
An EOS first, the EOS 7D Mark II features 65 all cross-type AF points* for high precision AF at remarkable speed. Cross-type AF points ensure stable AF that is not influenced by the subject&rsquo;s shape or color. On the EOS 7D Mark II, the AF points are spread over a wide area of the frame, enabling faster AF, wherever the subject lies. With a central dual cross-type AF point of f/2.8, AF is enhanced with lenses faster than f/2.8. And thanks to this new system, AF is possible even in dim lighting as low as EV-3.</p>

</ul>

<p>Achieve Impressive AF During Video Capture
Canon&rsquo;s innovative Dual Pixel CMOS AF enables you to shoot video like a camcorder with smooth, fast, and accurate autofocus and lets you enjoy instant and precise autofocus even when shooting stills
The EOS 7D Mark II features Canon&rsquo;s revolutionary Dual Pixel CMOS AF, a milestone in AF speed and accuracy that unlocks the potential of Live View shooting. This advanced technology has truly changed what is possible with a DSLR camera.</p>

<p>Dual Pixel CMOS AF involves a sophisticated rethinking of the CMOS sensor. Traditionally, image sensors have one photodiode per pixel for recording, but the CMOS sensor on the EOS 7D Mark II has two photodiodes per pixel, 40 million in total, enabling each pixel on the sensor to both perform phase-difference detection autofocus and capture light. With phase-difference detection AF, autofocus is achieved quickly and easily on the camera. This unique AF system enables autofocus on approximately 80% of the image plane, vertically and horizontally, and helps ensure virtually no loss in image quality.</p>

The benefits of Dual Pixel CMOS AF are clearly evident in Live View and video shooting, where the EOS 7D Mark II achieves natural, precise focus very quickly, even when switching between subjects. And, combined with the predictive power of Movie Servo AF, subjects in motion are smoothly and consistently tracked – once focus is locked, the EOS 7D Mark II holds on! Plus, with the shallow depth-of-field afforded by EOS optics, video gains a brilliant, cinematic ambience lacking when shooting video with many other Digital SLRs.
HD Quality, EOS Performance
Stunning Full HD video with custom Movie Servo AF (speed and sensitivity) for continuous focus tracking of moving subjects, multiple frame rates including Full HD recording at 60p in MOV and MP4 formats and uncompressed HDMI out
While offering performance improvements across the board for still photography, the EOS 7D Mark II is also an incredibly capable HD movie camera. Taking advantage of its Dual Pixel CMOS AF capabilities, the EOS 7D Mark II has customizable Movie Servo AF options: not only can AF location be defined, AF speed and tracking intervals can be specified too, for fluid, smooth focus transitions. The EOS 7D Mark II delivers refined and detailed image quality with Full HD 60P recording at ISO values up to 16000, has an HDMI output and records to both SD and CF cards for versatility and security during important shoots.</p>

<p>Comprehensive Information, Right in the Viewfinder
Intelligent Viewfinder II provides approximately 100% field of view for shooting ease
The EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s Intelligent Viewfinder II makes it easy to both shoot, change and confirm camera settings and shooting modes all without looking away from the viewfinder. Displaying approximately 100% of the composition, the viewfinder can show settings like shooting mode, exposure level, white balance, drive mode, AF operation, metering mode, recording format, even an electronic level and more. All of this information can be displayed by or superimposed easily over the image for review while shooting, and multiple views are customizable through the EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s simple user interface.</p>

<p>Specialty Controls, Built Right In
Improved custom controls and built-in intervalometer and bulb timer for expanded creativity
An EOS first, the EOS 7D Mark II offers time-lapse fixed-point shooting and long exposures without the need for a remote control. The EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s interval timer takes from 1 to 99 shots at preselected intervals, ideal for shooting flowers as they bloom or clouds drifting through the sky. Its built-in bulb timer keeps the shutter open for a designated amount of time, perfect for night photography, or to capture the flow of traffic on a street corner.</p>

<p>Built to Perform
Magnesium alloy body with shutter durability up to 200,000 cycles and enhanced dust and weather resistance
The EOS 7D Mark II is constructed of the highest quality materials, and to exacting standards that ensure unfettered performance at all times. For example, the shutter can shoot at speeds up to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8000</sub> sec. for up to 200,000 cycles, the chassis is built of lightweight and rigid magnesium, and the camera&rsquo;s seals are built to resist water and dust. This combination makes the EOS 7D Mark II ready for almost anything.</p>

<p>Speed and Accuracy with Intelligent Subject Recognition and Analysis
EOS Scene Detection System features a new 150,000-pixel RGB+IR Metering Sensor for improved precision
The EOS 7D Mark II has an amazing iSA Intelligent Subject Analysis system that employs an independent RGB light sensor with approximately 150,000-pixel resolution. This sensor enables Canon&rsquo;s intelligent Tracking and Recognition system (iTR AF) that detects and tracks subjects, automatically switching the AF point to optimize tracking. With new tracking algorithms tailored to recognize faces and colors, this system serves as a brilliant foundation to the EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s AF system.</p>

<p>Extraordinary GPS, Built-in
Built-in GPS* Receiver provides a digital compass, records location information (longitude, latitude, elevation and universal coordinated time (UTC)) as EXIF information for geotagging images when shooting
Ideal for travel or nature photography, the EOS 7D Mark II&rsquo;s built-in GPS* can record longitude, latitude and altitude data as EXIF data, can track movement at set intervals with its logging function, and can even set the camera&rsquo;s internal clock to local time! When using the logger function on a computer, you will see the exact route you travelled, and the map will show you where and when you took each image.</p>

<ul>
<li>In certain countries and regions, the use of GPS may be restricted. Therefore be sure to use GPS in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country or region. Be particularly careful when traveling outside your home country. As a signal is received from GPS satellites, take sufficient measures when using in locations where the use of electronics is regulated.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Shooting with the 7D MKII was immediately intuitive and natural: operation, balance and appearance are similar to my old 7D. While it felt like an old friend in my hands, the 65-point AF array is what got me to lay down my hard earned cash. Here are my impressions about the 7D MKII after a month of shooting.CONSTRUCTION is superb: magnesium body, matte black paint and heavy duty weather seals. Appearance is nearly identical to the old 7D save for the small plastic bump topside for the GPS antenna. In hand it feels confident and solid. The thick textured rubber and finger groove make for a secure grip.The 3.0&rdquo; 1,040,000 dot LCD is vivid and clear in most light&ndash;save for direct sunlight&ndash;but only a minor improvement over the old 7D. It&rsquo;s disappointing Canon didn&rsquo;t bump it up to a larger size or add touch screen ability.The shutter sound is softer than the original 7D but louder than a 6D. Silent drive mode fades operation to pianissimo, but with slower performance, making it ideal for ceremonies.CONTROLS: Most controls are the same as the old 7D but with some reshuffling and additions. The biggies are a dedicated &ldquo;Rate&rdquo; button, a larger and repositioned DOF button and a programable &ldquo;spring&rdquo; lever around the joystick. Controls feel solid and can be operated by feel while looking through the viewfinder.The lever is the most useful new control. At default programming, it cycles through the six AF area modes. Its placement next to the joystick makes switching AF modes and subsequent selection of AF points faster and more intuitive than the 7D and 70D. Like the 7D before it, my preferences are user selected single point or zone focus. Trusting a computer to pick the subject is often iffy.The 7D2 offers another first: the ability to set up both the AF-On and * buttons so one activates Servo AF and the other One-Shot. Ideal for subjects that move but suddenly stay still, e.g., tracking a bird in flight that lands. This setting is under C.Fn3: Disp/Operation =&gt; Custom Controls. Select the buttons you wish to customize, press &ldquo;Info,&rdquo; and, finally, make your selection in the &ldquo;AF Operation&rdquo; detail. Many other custom AF options are valuable as well.AUTOFOCUS: The all cross-type, 65-point AF is the headline feature. Frame coverage is huge, besting any EOS before it. Off-center subjects are a snap: pick any AF point and focus is blazing fast and accurate. Low light AF is also vastly improved: locks in murky light the old 7D struggled in, e.g., dim night club and theatre stages. It drove my EF 300 4L USM and EF 70-200 4L IS USM lickety-split. AI servo and iTR effortlessly tracked brides, runners and bikers across the 65 AF points. Metering is tied to the active AF point and effortlessly adjusts to changing subject light. The keeper rate of moving subjects is nearly double that of my old 7D. And with buffering enough for 30 RAW images (fast CF card), that&rsquo;s a lot of keepers!The only AF nitpick thus far is my existing lenses needed micro adjustment (calibration) for optimal sharpness. Oddly, most of these same lenses were fine at default on my old 7D.IMAGE QUALITY: I processed RAW images in DPP 4.1 and was pleased with detail, color rendition and noise control. There is little difference in low ISO noise compared to the 7D. In fact, image quality is very similar to the 7D from ISO 100 to 800, i.e., excellent. At ISO 1600+ the 7D MKII pulls away from the 7D: a level less noise, but that noise is devoid of banding and more grain-like. This type of noise is easier to control with noise reduction plug-ins. I was able to easily squeeze out another stop of acceptable high ISO over my 7D.VIDEO: Contrast detection AF during video and LiveView is a mammoth improvement over the 7D: responsive, accurate and a camcorder-like movie servo mode. Wish it had a touch screen for focus-pulls. That said, the improved contrast detection AF is a great feature.VIEWFINDER: The 100% coverage and 1.0x magnification are the same spec as the old 7D but with improved clarity and brightness. Even with a F4 zoom the viewfinder is a joy to use: bright, smooth and vivid. Like an EVF, the transmissive LCD display&ndash;transparent LCD over the focusing screen&ndash;can display icons, AF patterns, metering patterns, grid and plain matte screens and an electronic level. You can choose not to display most of it. I stick with just the grid and active AF points.FLASH: The popup flash is fine for fill and snapshots, and functions as a wireless E-TTL master. My 430EX II worked well as a slave bounced off walls and ceilings. Both bounce and direct flash images were well exposed. FEC was rarely needed.GOTCHAS: Not many nitpicks but battery life is 300 or 400 images less than my old 7D, even with GPS disabled. I assume the upgrades to 65-AF point array and Dual DIGIC 6 image processors demand more power. Carry a spare LP-E6 or two.FINAL BURB: The 7D MKII is a marriage of &ldquo;classic&rdquo; 7D form factor with a tweaked 70D CMOS and cutting edge 65-point AF array. Toss in GPS, Movie Servo, a large buffer and that&rsquo;s the 7D MKII in a nutshell. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to use and difficult to make it miss focus or get a bad exposure. While the 7D MKII is more like the 7D than different, it&rsquo;s a significant upgrade over the original 7D in AF performance, noise control at high ISO and weather sealing. It&rsquo;s the real deal for sports, BIF and adverse weather shooting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Sunday I had my 7DII for two full days. I got one day shipping. The 7D replaces my 60D.I found the photos from the 7D are sharper then the same scene shot with the 60D. (I mounted my 70-300 mm L lens on a tripod, then switched cameras to shot the same scene.) The viewfinder is brighter and has more contrast.One of the first thing I found was that the controls for navigating the various menus are very different between the 60D and 7DII. The menus are very similar but the means of navigation are different.The 7DII is not a point and shot camera. I spent considerable time going through the 550 pages full instruction guide. Since I shoot landscapes I could skip much of the manual. That is the pdf version that comes on the CD. Not the 180 page BASIC instruction guide. How someone could spend 45 minutes in a store during which he bought a card and battery then gain command of this camera indicates the quality of his effort. The auto focus is very complex since it supports still and moving subjects. It is easy to see why the camera would not focus well right out of the box. The problem is not the camera but rather the operator.The 7DII is a very customizable camera. It can be tuned to the particular type of shooting a user does - wildlife, landscape, etc. But a very tunable camera requires study. However, the basic 180 page manual shows you how to simply take picturesThe 7DII is so customizable that Canon has prepared 6 tutorials to explain these capabilities: <a href="http://www.learn.usa.canon.com/galleries/galleries/tutorials/eos7dmarkii_tutorials.shtml">http://www.learn.usa.canon.com/galleries/galleries/tutorials/eos7dmarkii_tutorials.shtml</a>. If you are really into photography and want to create your own camera, the 7DII is the way to go. The customization is really oriented toward fast action shooting. Practically every setting is viewable in the viewfinder and can be changed with a push of a customized button. It seems to be junior version 1DX.All in all I found the 7DII to be a substantial upgrade from my 60D.One difficulty with this camera is that Adobe does not yet support it. (Canon may have been unwilling to pay Adobe enough.) I shoot RAW. To post a picture here I must first process the photo using DPP, etc. Just not worth the effort. However, I could compare the CR2 images using Windows Photo Viewer. I could examine the comparable photos at 200% in DPP.</p>

<p>OMG I&rsquo;m 40+ years old and using omg&hellip;yes&hellip;this camera is that good! I upgraded from the original 7D which I was in love with&hellip;however it was not great in low light. I shoot a bunch of high school football and basketball which do not typically have great lighting! I can shoot 6400 quite easily now and almost not tell if the photos are not blown up for large prints. Can easily be used as desktop wall paper size with little noise reduction in post. I love the focus system, the 10 frames a second (on paper it doesn&rsquo;t sound like much from 7fps on the 7dmk1 but it truly shoots 10fps and you may not have been quite getting 7 on the org 7d. This thing is a machine gun! Uses same digic 6 processors as the very latest 1dx. It&rsquo;s a killer camera. simple straight forward!</p>

<p>Good camera. It does what I expected of a 7D. But it feels like it&rsquo;s made of some kind of cheap material or something. For this kind of money I&rsquo;d expect a little better quality.</p>
