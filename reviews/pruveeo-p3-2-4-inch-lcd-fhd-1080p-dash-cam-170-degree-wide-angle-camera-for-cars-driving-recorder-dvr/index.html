<blockquote>
<p>This is an evaluation of the Pruveeo P3 Dashboard traffic camera. This is not my first traffic camera and I don’t intend to get into a protracted discussion on the deficiencies of the previous cameras. Suffice it to say I had to find one that actually performed; and this one does.The P3 camera is very compact and fits just in front of the rear view mirror and does not block my forward view at all. It does not come with a suction cup, but rather, it uses a double back adhesive tape to attach a mounting adapter to the inside of the windshield. The parcel had two mounting adapters and adhesive stickers, for easy transfer of the camera between two vehicles. You should be careful to select where to mount the adapter, because once it is stuck, it would be really difficult to pull it loose and re position it. If your vehicle power plug (formally called cigarette lighter) is activated with the ignition switch, the camera will automatically start and stop recording with the position of the ignition switch. Conversely, if the power plug remains active at all times, you would have to connect the camera directly to a switchable circuit while being very careful to maintain correct battery polarity to avoid severe damage to the camera. Or just plug it in when start driving and unplug it when you stop. Just don’t forget to unplug it or you might end up with a dead battery. Unlike most products produced in China, this instruction pamphlet was clearly written by a native speaker of English; it is concise and easily followed. The camera does not come with an SD card and will not work without one. The camera uses (up to) a 32 GB micro SD card, which is available here on Amazon for around $10. Then again, if you already have a micro SD card smaller than 32gb it would work because the 10-minute loop recording requires just 1.3 gb. You will have to lift the camera off the mount to insert or extract the SD card, because the slot is not accessible while the camera is mounted. Also, you will need a SD card reader/writer adapter to format and or download the video files to the USB port on the computer. You should format the SD card with FAT32. My personal preference for an SD reader is Tragus high-speed SD/SDHC/ T-F, which will accept anything up to a 64 gb SD card. I set the camera resolution at 1080 and the daylight video is remarkably clear and a license plate digit is legible within about 25 feet.In conclusion, this is the best dash camera I have seen at any price and I have seen quite a few. I can recommend this camera and the seller. Regards JR TThe technical data on this dash camera is remarkable and roughly comparable to that of my JVC Everio (1080) HD Hard drive camcorder, which cost me $535 five years ago. I have scanned side by side the properties of both video clips and only a slight difference in color saturation and slight flicker of the lighted traffic signs between frames is evident.Pruveeo dash camera: Frame height: 1920 -Frame width: 1080 – Data rate: 11877 kbps- Total Bit-rate: 12389 kbps- Frame rate: 30 frames / secondJVC hard drive camcorder: Frame hight: 1920 – Frame width: 1080 – Data rate: 11877 kbps Total Bit-rate 16056 kbps – Frame rate: 59 frames /second.Don’t be concerned with the capacity of the mini SD card (not included) because the camera loops back and overwrites existing video clips when the card fills up. A 16 GB card will serve just as well as a 32 GB (which is the maximum size the camera will accept), but you should specify class 10 when ordering the SD Card.; which is available here on Amazon. You should connect the camera to a power outlet that is active only when the ignition switch is turned on. Use only the included voltage regulated power adapter, because the camera operates on 5 volts, not 12volts. The camera will automatically start recording when you start the engine and stop when the ignition switch is off.If your rearview mirror has wiring connected to it, you could tap into that power and connect the dashboard camera an eliminate the unsightly wire hanging down from the camera.There are two questions regarding that wiring arraignment and some soldering of wires would be required.Test the voltage on the wires on the mirror and determine (1) that it is 12vdc and (2) that the power is there only when the ignition switch is on.This modification will work only if these two tests are affirmative. The camera operates on 5 volts DC and 12volts would immediately destroy the camera. The provided power plug adaptor has a small circuit board inside it and you must open the plastic housing of that and cut he wires and remove the printed circuit board. You must pay attention to polarity (+ &ndash;) of all four wires and which two are inputs (12volt) and which two are (5 volt) leading to the camera. Clip the wires off the circuit board while leaving as much length as possible attached to the board. Strip a short section of the insulation from the ends of all four wires. Cut the camera wire about 6 inches away from the special plug that fits into the camera and strip a short section of the insulation from the two colored wires. Twist the camera plug wires to the circuit board wires, while observing common color match of the insulation and solder it and use shrink tubing to cover the unions. Pull the power plug from the back of the rearview mirror and using a volt meter to identify the power (12volt) wire and the ground wire. Carefully cut about a quarter inch of the insulation from both wires, while not actually cutting the wire. The removed insulation from the power and ground wires should not be directly adjacent to each other. Use a section of the previously discarded camera wire and while observing the previously established polarity attach and solder to the two wires to the mirror harness. You can’t use shrink tubing here, so wrap the solder joints individually with electrical tape. Cut the repurposed camera wire off about 6 inches from the solder joints. Split the insulation sheath and separate the two internal wires, slide a short section of shrink tubing onto each and solder the wires to the circuit board wires. Slide the shrink tubing over the solder joints and lightly drag hot the tip of the solder iron across the shrink tubing. Install the camera and reconnect the vehicle plug to the rearview mirror, plug the special connector into the camera and the camera will start recording each time the ignition is turned on. It is universally accepted that no alteration job is actually complete until some duct tape is used. So, bunch up the exposed wires and duct tape that and the reconfigured circuit board to the back side of the rearview mirror</p>

<h5 id="good-video-quality">Good Video Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes very good video, would have been a plus to offer GPS functionality or addition GPS plate.I searched for one on Amazon and was told non is offered that fit this unit.I have it installed behind the mirror and it is nearly not noticeable.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-like-watching-a-movie">it s like watching a movie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In the day time the quality is superb, you can clearly see the license plate of the car in front, pedestrians, other cars, it s like watching a movie. At night, it s not as good. At night the sensor really picks up bright lights (headlights, traffic lights) when they are near you, making other objects in the frame at that moment darker and more blurry. The dash cam is really simple to install and set up, on-screen menu is legible and easy to navigate. One thing to keep in mind about this model: it doesn&rsquo;t really adjust up/down that much due to its design, so it needs to be mounted higher on the windshield, otherwise you going to see your vehicle&rsquo;s hood covering a big part of the lower portion of the video. Hope this helps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: Their customer service has been spot on. They offered me a replacement unit. I was sent an upgraded camera which has been working well since I received it. Giving it four stars due to the prompt customer service.Piece of junk. I ordered one of these. Didn&rsquo;t use it right away. First time out it recorded an hour trip fine. Next time out, it crashed, and stopped recording almost immediately. I reset the device, and it crashed and locked up again. I read the instructions, and it said to reformat the card, and / or replace card of the problem continues. I did all of the above multiple times, with multiple cards, and it crashes within 2 to 3 minutes of starting it. I took a 10 hour trip and had absolutely no video. And apparently I can&rsquo;t return it now to amazon as its been too long.</p>

<h5 id="cool">Cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first time to buy this driving recorder for my husband. This clarity is clear.And it looks small and does not take up space. There are many languages to choose. The opeartion is simple. It allows me in the event of things when I can quickly replay the road conditions. If it can come with a memory card is more better</p>

<h5 id="good-product-and-excellent-service">Good product and excellent Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered mine knowing nothing about them. Pruveeo took it back and provided me with the information I needed to make an intelligent (I hope) decision and helped me order the one best suited for me. It has been years since I had seen Customer Service like that. They will get my business from now on!</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-but-not-robust-system">Easy to use, but not robust system.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have installed it for two months.Though it worked at beginning, I noticed recently that the camera will freeze and stop to work occasionally.None of the keys function, and the only thing you can do is pluging out the power cable and let its battery run out. After reconnecting the cable the camera then revives.This has happend twice since the last months which is the second month I started to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="image-is-pretty-decent-and-so-far-i-m-happy">Image is pretty decent and so far I&rsquo;m happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased 4 different types of cheap dashcams, and so far I like this one in terms of image &amp; options. It would be nice if this camera had a feature to adjust the lens from left to right. I may buy another one depending on the durability of this camera.</p>
