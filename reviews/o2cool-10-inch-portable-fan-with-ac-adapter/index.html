<h5 id="good-little-fan">Good little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good little fan, and I&rsquo;ve got no complaints for the $20 price. A very necessary item for camping or hiking during hot and humid summer days, when you can&rsquo;t always count on a breeze when you want it. Also makes a rather quiet and conveniently sized fan around your home, car, or office (I&rsquo;ve often been annoyed that 120V box fans are so loud, even on their LOW setting). And an important bit of emergency preparedness, providing just a little bit of airflow and cooling in event of grid power failing during hot summer days (hope you&rsquo;ve got LOTS of fully-charged D batteries lying around, or a spare car battery!).On LOW it&rsquo;s pretty quiet, about as loud as a ceiling fan (after two years of light use, the motor has become significantly noisier). If you&rsquo;re sensitive to noise, it might bother you just a little bit trying to sleep in-front of it. But when you really need it, you probably won&rsquo;t complain&hellip;My only objection is the two screws you have to lighten/loosen to change the batteries. A bit of hassle, that could have been avoided. I wish they had used some other method to hold the batteries securely that didn&rsquo;t require the extra time and tools.I am happy to see that the AC adapter is 12V (which is very common), even though the 6xD batteries will only provide about half that, requiring more circuitry within the fan. It runs noticeably faster and louder on 12V than on batteries, but nothing dramatic. I also love that the outlet/receptacle on the fan accepts BOTH of the two most common type of DC barrel plugs, making a good connection with either, so a couple of car/cig adapters I&rsquo;ve already got laying around work just perfectly with this fan.Specs on AC/DC wall-wart:Switching AdapterMODEL:SUN-1200070INPUT:100-240V~ 50/60Hz 0.05AOUTPUT:12V &mdash; 0.7A (positive center polarity)Measured power consumption:LOW: 5WHIGH: 9WPF: .51The electronics near the plug (presumably the voltage regulator) gets noticeably warm during operation on wall or car power (but not on battery power). But after a several hours, it still seems to be staying only just slightly warm, so no worries, but it might have been a bit more efficient with a different design.UPDATE: Be careful about ordering this fan. From several user comments, it sounds like the fan might have been significantly redesigned recently, OR perhaps one (or more) of the sellers here could be passing off a different and wrong product. Be aware.</p>

<h5 id="not-as-good-as-it-once-was">Not as Good as it Once Was</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I owned one of these from years back, same size, same maker. This is Virtually the same model but the batteries inserted differently. TO ME, its seems the power and breeze is not nearly as strong as the one I previously owned (Has two speeds low and high), the one I owned prior could easily run 6+ hours on battery only with some slowing in the final hour.. But still, it runs VERY quietly, in fact if you have a TV or radio on normal or less volume you might not even note it was on minus the breeze. And during summer/power outage thunderstorm season these are MUST HAVES as who wants to sit in STUFFY while waiting on the power company. Just put a bowl of ice in front of it and mini a/c on batteries. Would be great for camping, porches-keeping bugs off you etc. I cannot speak for how long this will run on battery life as I just got and have it on DC power. Tested with Batteries and runs fine BUT slower than previous design. If you lose the back, you lose your battery power ability, I do not like that compared to the older model, poor and cheap design as backs DO get lost over time on portable items. It comes with two tiny little Philips type screws with springs, VERY annoying and unless you are going camping, you really do not have to use them. The back can be fussy to put back on once batteries are in and has that cheap, easily breakable feel-for that 3 stars, the older model was 5 stars. Will about slice your fingers trying to get them started. Cheap. Otherwise the fan is exactly the same as it&rsquo;s older predecessor. But despite my 3 stars I will probably get another, its nice looking and who can beat a battery operated fan this size. Do not let my 3 star rating discourage you from buying but note that-the makers have sadly taken some cheap shortcuts from the fan they made in the past and buy doing that they should have also lowered the price. I would rather pay a couple bucks more for quality, my last one lasted for YEARS with even months of non stop 24 hour a day (on DC power) use.</p>

<h5 id="surprisingly-powerful-fan">Surprisingly powerful fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bathroom in our basement has a narrow window facing our backyard. We run a dehumidifier in the basement all summer to keep it comfortable and to keep the paneling from buckling up. It is frustrating to work so hard to dehumidify the basement only to take a shower and have it add to the moisture.I decided to purchase this fan and place it in my window backwards so it could be used as an exhaust fan to draw moist air out of the bathroom and keep it from drifting into the main area of the basement. There isn&rsquo;t a plug near the window, so I chose this model because it is run by batteries.It fits just perfect in the window. I had all three of my kids take steamy showers while it ran and then I ran it for about 15 minutes after they were done. It did an amazing job clearing the moist air out of the bathroom. Normally it feels like a steam room at the YMCA for hours after someone has a shower, but tonight, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known someone had showered if my kids hadn&rsquo;t left their wet towels laying on the floor.I am so happy I purchased this fan for my bathroom. I am not using it as a traditional fan, but as a side note, it does throw out a nice amount of air. I am glad to have it as a backup if the electricity goes out on a hot and humid night.</p>

<h5 id="burnt-out">Burnt out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this fan in April 2014, and last night the motor burned out, like fried black. Pretty scary because it was running in my daughter&rsquo;s room. I came here to write a review for people who run these fans throughout the night. Just quickly reading through some reviews it seems that people who bought fans in early 2014 experienced this fried motor problem. It must&rsquo;ve been a bad manufacture time.It&rsquo;s interesting because I bought this same fan first in 2013, and that one is still working and I actually love it. It&rsquo;s got a slim profile, fairly quiet, is slightly tilted up for good air flow, and gives a good output of air. It&rsquo;s a shame that the other one died and I saw so many bad reviews of the fan just dying like that because now I wouldn&rsquo;t reorder. But I&rsquo;m glad I know so I can take better precaution using it.</p>

<p>I wanted to like it, but after about 1 hour of run time, the bearings in the fan are squealing already and its one of those noises that the military uses to drive people insane.</p>
