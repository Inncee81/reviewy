<p>Style Name:Vertical Ball Rack
Product Description
Find your favorite sports ball faster with the Rubbermaid Garage FastTrack Vertical Ball Rack. Made for easy storing and retrieving, the adjustable bungee cords in the front allows you to easily remove a ball when you need it. Supporting up to 50 lbs., this sports ball rack can easily be attached to the Rubbermaid FastTrack Rail (sold separately) or mounted directly to the wall. From soccer balls to basketballs, keep them all in one place for an easy find.</p>

<p>Amazon.com
Quickly store basketballs, volleyballs, footballs, soccer balls, and more with this vertical ball rack from Rubbermaid. This ball rack gets balls off the floor and onto the wall. Bungee cords hold balls in while providing easy access to balls of all sizes.</p>

<p>The unit mounts easily to wall studs or to the Rubbermaid FastTrack rail (sold separately on Amazon.com along with a full line of FastTrack storage system components). Designed to hold up to 50 pounds, the device is equipped with a cast aluminum gripper that snaps tightly into the FastTrack rail system for that particular mounting application. The hook is protected with a soft coating that won&rsquo;t scratch. And, it flips down flat against the wall out of the way when not in use. A satin nickel powder-coated finish won&rsquo;t rust, chip or crack for years of reliable storage. &ndash;Brian D. Olson</p>

<h5 id="works-without-the-fasttrack-rails">Works without the FastTrack rails!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not find any other way to hang my string trimmer on the wall effectively. I have a 14 foot 2&rdquo;x6&rdquo; lag bolted to the garage studs which I hang various yard tools from. The Rubbermaud FasTrack hangers are made to hang from their track system. The top and bottom screw holes do not line up flat against the 2&rdquo;x6&rdquo; as Rubbermaid makes them offset to only properly fit their track. I did not want to use their track for a number of reasons including being stuck with buying only their system hangers. I used construction screws and some washers to make this hanger lie flat against the 2&rdquo;x6&rdquo; and it worked fine!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-hook-on-a-great-system">Great hook on a great system.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The power tool hook is great! It fits my Stihl string trimmer perfectly. It won&rsquo;t hold my Stihl blower though, the longer ladder or multi purpose hooks work great for that. One thing to note, I had it on the rail in my garage, and it works perfectly. That was temporary as I was in the process of getting a new shed. I hung a 84in rail in the shed, on open studs. The weight of the trimmer (15lbs) and the lack of solid wall behind the rail pushed the plastic clip and the spring behind it out of the little hinges that hold it onto the metal. This resulted in the hook only being held on by the top and not the bottom, so it could easily be pulled off the wall with the tool. I was able to get the plastic back on and put a screw behind it to offer more support for the plastic piece. This hook should be designed for the extra weight that a trimmer with a full tank of gas presents. But it&rsquo;s only a problem on open stud walls. Other than that, I totally recommend this hook.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is described as a mesh basket but depicted as a wire basket. So, what do you get? I got a wire basket which is fine with me since I really did not care what type it was but I just needed a basket. I love the FastTrack system and have many of the attachments including a Rubbermaid mesh basket which I purchased at Lowes. I have a wire basket from Lowes as well but needed another one and did not feel like making a trip to Lowes when Amazon delivers right to my door.This is a sturdy basket which I use to store various garden hose parts and attachments. It is two feet long, a foot wide and about eight and a half inches deep. It holds a lot of stuff.FYI, the basket comes with an instruction sheet which refers to it as a wire basket. On the basket itself is a label which also calls it a wire basket. If you are in need of a mesh basket you will need to look elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="basket-has-2-hanging-options">basket has 2 hanging options!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK&hellip; if you are BUYING THE BASKETS, look at the photos, so you know how to attach them to the brackets.I installed 2 baskets in my garage and thought &ldquo;Wow&hellip; these look really sloppy. The online photos are fakes! The baskets tip down at a 30 degree angle. OK for my use, but I feel mis-lead.&rdquo; Then I came back to this page to write exactly this message, but decided to poke about a bit to see if other people had this issue and how they might have fixed it.It turns out that there are 2 cross bars on each of the brackets (the part that clamps on to the rail). If you hang the basket off of the lower bar (the one with the cut-out), you get the 30 degree droop like I did. If you hang the basket off of the upper cross bar, you get a perfectly even-hanging basket. I just noticed that the product photos show both options being used.See my attached photo to see both options at the same time.</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-and-easy-install">Sturdy and easy install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for my troybilt weedeater and it is fantastic! My home already came with rails (which are the cheap part apparently) so I had to buy a few attachments. These really are worth the money since they are rubber gripped and super sturdy as long as the rail is mounted correctly. It&rsquo;s so nice to just walk up and grab my weedeater instead of going through all my outdoor equipment to find it. Snaps right on, then locks in place with the black lever shown.. really easy! Gave it 4 stars because I wish it was cheaper!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-the-answer-for-bike-storage">These are the answer for bike storage!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the answer for bike storage! I was extremely hesitant that several of these little hooks attached to my rail system would hold all our family bicycles, but wow was I wrong! Finally, no more cluttered mess of bikes all piled against each other in the corner. They look really nice hung up against the wall and the amount of space saved is incredible! I would highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="i-really-like-the-fasttrack-system-overall">I really like the FastTrack system overall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Several years ago we outfitted our garage and storage shed with the FastTrack system and it&rsquo;s been great. We&rsquo;ve got all kinds of different attachments for it and it&rsquo;s very handy to be able to move the different hangers and hooks around as our needs change. The other day while moving some stuff around in the garage, my wife bumped into her bike which caused it to shift weirdly and it ended up bending the roughly 5-6 year old bike hanger. No big deal though, I went on Amazon and ordered a new one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-system-to-get-stuff-off-the-floor-in-your-garage">Excellent system to get stuff off the floor in your garage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can easily store three to four items per hook. We even used two (I know, you could have used one but my husband insisted on tw) for our Little Giant ladder and now it feels like we have a lot more room in the garage. We&rsquo;ve got two systems at different spots so there&rsquo;s nothing left on the ground to trip over, or accidentally run over&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t understand that I had to buy an expensive hanger bracket.</p>
