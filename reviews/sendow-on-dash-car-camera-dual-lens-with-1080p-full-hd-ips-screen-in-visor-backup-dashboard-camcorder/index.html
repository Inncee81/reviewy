<h5 id="the-best-part-about-this-one-is-that-is-comes-with">The best part about this one is that is comes with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a sleek looking dash cam. It is simple to operate. The best part about this one is that is comes with a second camera and it will record both at the same time. You can have one camera facing forwards and one camera facing backwards. You can use the second camera as a backup camera if you want. It is a good camera for the price.In the video, at about the 2 minute 15 second mark, the semi truck in front of me had a tire blow out. It was far enough in front of me that you can&rsquo;t see it too well in the video. Had I been closer and this turned into an accident, this dash cam video would provide the evidence I need. I definitely recommend everyone to have a dash cam.PROs:Dual cameras can both record at the same timeSleek designSolid constructionSturdy mountGreat wide-angle viewPicture in picture to see both cameras at onceBig, clear screenVery easy to set up and useCharger includedCONs:Video quality could be better - you will only be able to read a license plate on the video if it is within maybe one car lengthLow-light recording could be better - but you can increase the exposure to help compensate for that</p>

<h5 id="happy-and-very-satisfied-with-this-dash-cam">Happy and very satisfied with this dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this dash cam for extra protection when I am driving. As I opened the box, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the dash cam is heavy compared to my previous dash cam. It looks like a digital camera. It comes with rear view back up camera with enough cable to set it up. The dash cam is easy to use. I just follow the included manual and attached the dash cam on my windshield and tried taking pictures and videos with it. I&rsquo;ve noticed that it can capture high quality picture resolution on daytime and ok for night time also. It has a lot of setting to choose from. It has 170 degree wide angle lens which is very good because it can capture the whole road ahead. I inserted 32 gb micro sd card which is not included in the box. I don&rsquo;t worry about not having enough memory because it has a loop recording feature that deletes and overwrites old file. I can put important videos on protected mode so it will be saved in the disc for future reference. Overall I am happy and very sarisfied with my purchased of this high quality dash cam.</p>

<h5 id="dash-camera">Dash Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a dash camera thats the size of a deck of cards that suctions to your windshield. You can pivot it and record whatever angle you&rsquo;d like. It has very clear picture and recording. It requires a micro SD card otherwise all youdo is plug it in your lighter and then we put the SD card in our computer to see footage enlarged. We got this as a gift for my son who has been stopped unlawfully and ticketed by our bored small town cop. It wouldbe better of it were able to determime speed.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-dash-camera">Awesome Dash Camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>we got this camera before we went on a road trip with their family . On the highway when we were exiting off we saw a pick up truck hit a small car. I was so surprised that the pick up truck kept driving away after the accident luckily we had this awesome camera if were able to get the license plate number.Are use this camera every day as it just sits on my dash in my car. It starts with the car and turns off when I turn off the car. I don&rsquo;t even have to think about anymore it just does it on its own and is always recording. I&rsquo;m so happy I got this camera!It plugs into the USB port that we have in our car and it comes with its own charging cable they can plug directly into the car outlet. You can try to use either one in your car.</p>

<h5 id="best-part-about-it-comes-with-a-rear-cam">Best part about it comes with a rear cam!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very impressed with this little dash camera. It has a lot of functions including a function in which the camera will automatically turn on and begin recording if it senses a collision or sudden movement. I tried this by having the camera off and shaking the vehicle from the side as hard as I could and with the sensitivity on very high it began recording. It comes with a little rear camera that will automatically show up in the main screen as a picture in picture and records to the Sd card in a separate file folder. It automatically records and will record over the oldest clip and you could set the clip lengths from one minute to up to five minutes.</p>

<h5 id="we-absolutely-love-this-dashboard-camera">We absolutely love this dashboard camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very high quality product! We absolutely love this dashboard camera. It&rsquo;s super slim and great looking. Very easy to set up and use, even for such non tech-savy people like ourselves)) Impressed with the HD quality of the video - it&rsquo;s clear and crisp. The loop recording feature is really great - we don&rsquo;t need to worry about the card running out of space and about having to delete old files. This cam gets the job done all by itself!The packaging and the instructions are very good as well. Especially for the price this camera is amazing, worth every dollar and more.</p>
