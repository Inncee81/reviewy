<h5 id="best-lipo-case-i-have-tons-of-room-great-portability">Best Lipo case I have&hellip; Tons of room, great portability!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Absolutely great lipo case! I have a few other cases, most of them are flat and not lunch box style, so they don&rsquo;t hold as much. They are also velcro closing which is a pain. The Colcase is a zipper style case and the quality is great. You can fit at least 25 1300 4s Lipos in it, or if you use 3000mah-5000mah, you can stack them in lengthwise and squeeze in at least 10 without issues. Also, it makes a great case for box style goggles!! Great product!!</p>

<p>COLCASE Fireproof Explosionproof Lipo Safe Bag for Lipo Battery Storage and Charging, Large Space Highly Sturdy Double Zipper Lipo Battery Bag (198x150x135mm) ReviewPros:• Square box shape• Zippered• Handle• Holds a good number of liposCons• Zipper fireproof/resistant?UnboxingThe lipo bag came flattened and in self-sealing plastic bag. There were no signs of rough handling or tears and rips. Simply unpeel the sealed end of the clear bag and pull the lipo bag out.AssemblyUnflatten the lipo bag, open and push out from the inside to get the shape. Then insert lipos and zip close.ConclusionLipo bags are a MUST for anyone flying electric r/c aircraft or vehicles. Lipos burn at extremely high temperatures when they are old and/or mistreated. Lipo bags are designed to lessen the impact of a fire by trying to contain the flame. I have been using the flat lipo bags with hook and loop flaps for years, but always disliked how strong the hook and loop flap was.I have been intrigued by zippered lipo sacks for a little while but had my doubts on how the zipper would hold up to a lipo fire. I finally bit the bullet and indulged on a zippered lipo sack. I am glad I did. This lipo sack is much easier to open and close, feels like it is made out of the same or at least similar material as my other lipo bags, and has a carrying handle. The case easily accommodates my twelve 3S 2200-2700mAh lipos. Compared to the flat and tall lipo sacks, finding the lipo I want is much easier in this box style sack. The carrying handle is so much easier to use than trying to grip a flatter flap. I find it so much easier to store my lipos in this box style case than the traditional flat bag style.For this review, I will not try to burn the inside of the bag with a lighter like other YouTube &ldquo;reviewers&rdquo; have done because the lighter’s flame does not come close to simulating a real lipo fire. If I have a lipo fire within this bag, I&rsquo;ll update the review. But in the mean time I cannot comment on the fireproof capabilities of the bag.• Do I recommend this lipo bag? YES, always store and charge lithium chemistry batteries in a lipo bag.• Does it work? I have no reason to believe it won&rsquo;t, and quite frankly I don&rsquo;t want to find out.• Is this for beginners? Absolutely!</p>

<h5 id="i-always-enjoy-having-the-piece-of-mind-of-keeping-my-batteries">I always enjoy having the piece of mind of keeping my batteries &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I always enjoy having the piece of mind of keeping my batteries in fireproof bags. When I first started out I only needed a small bag, as I was flying toy drones. As I graduated to race drones and later photo drones my batteries kept getting bigger and bigger, and I kept getting more and more of them. My small bags were getting filled, and my Phantom batteries wouldn&rsquo;t even fit. I needed another option.Enter this bag:It&rsquo;s huge! It can fit all of my Phantom bags and then some other batteries as well! This makes travel to the field convenient, as well as home storage- it&rsquo;s a snap! I recommend this to any drone pilot as a safe way of storing your batteries when not flying.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-lunch-box-style-lipo-safe-carry-storage-bag">Great value lunch box style LIPO safe carry/storage bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best bang for your buck when it comes to protecting yourself from LIPO fires. Think of this as a big lunch box for keeping your house or car safe. It will easily hold ALL your batteries (and you can pack it silly with anything you want!).In essence this is a flexible / collapsible fireproof bag. It is best used to keep the fire (inside) away from anything flammable (external items like you, your house or car).Very good build quality, strong zippers (altho I suspect the material around them is not fire proof, I didn&rsquo;t want to melt them to try testing it out).Got a chance to take this out over the July 4th holiday to the fields to fly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-bag-at-a-very-good-price">Very good bag at a very good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Colcase Lipo Safe Bag is a very good lipo bag that can hold a good quantity of batteries. I fit four 3200mah 3s batteries attached to a balance board and put them (including the balance board) in the bag. Less than an hour later they were fully cooked and ready to come out! And I don&rsquo;t mean they caught fire!The bag has a carry handle which is convenient when the dual zipper is closed and it&rsquo;s large enough to fit almost any size battery. It also collapses down flat so it&rsquo;s very convenient to place in a field or tool box to take to the field.The one issue I see is when connecting batteries directly to the charger (not through a balance board), there may be a limited length of wires coming from the battery (charge and balance wires) not allowing the batteries to lie flat in the bag. With the way I charge and not using balance connector extensions, the battery has to be close to the charger. Therefore, you have to have the battery wires protruding from the bag through a gap in the zipper and then connect to the charger so the bag will have to be close to the charger. I would like to see a port or hole in the lower portion of the battery from which the battery wires can be routed to the outside to connect to the charger. Even better, have the option to purchase a balance board in various types of connectors to connect batteries to INSIDE the bag and then have the charger connections on the outside of the bag.Another enhancement can be a battery divider system so one can transport and store batteries in the bag. Sure, a divider system can be fashioned or the battery connectors can be covered to prevent shorts, but a divider system sold with the bag may be a great option that I would certainly purchase.Overall, for the price, this is a good lipo safe bag that will come in handy for a long time. I am more at ease when charging lipos in this bag when I have to step away for a few minutes. It&rsquo;s much safer than charging the batteries out in the open. The true test of this bag I hope to never experience, is if a battery decides to go up in flames. More to come on that if it ever happens!</p>
