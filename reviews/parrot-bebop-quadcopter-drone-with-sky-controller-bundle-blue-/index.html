<h5 id="the-bebop-is-easily-worth-5-stars">THE BEBOP IS EASILY WORTH 5 STARS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THE BEBOP IS EASILY WORTH 5 STARS, but not in it&rsquo;s current condition - I will explain.Background:I am not new to flying drones. My first drone was the DJI Phantom 2 vision plus - a much more delicate and breakable drone when crashed then the Bebop, but it is also bigger, a lot more powerful, takes better video quality, and originally costing about $400 to $500 more then the Bebop with a Skycontroller.Bebop Pros:*The Bebop is very durable for a drone and can take a good amount of crashes without breaking parts. This is huge, because as a new drone pilot you will crash, period.- and probably quite a bit too. Where with other drones, like the Phantom 2 Vision plus, parts will break (like the gimbal) and camera and that alone costs, about $600. to replace.*The Bebop&rsquo;s video is extremely stable and sturdy without a gimbal. This is huge too. No moving parts, less things that will break when you crash. Video quality isn&rsquo;t as good as say the Phantom 2 Vision plus, but it&rsquo;s well worth the trade to have a very smooth video - and I prefer the Bebop&rsquo;s technology for video stabilization then that of a gimbal.*Drone is pretty small. Some might think this is a downsize, but I found it a lot more convenient then with my Phantom. It&rsquo;s easy to carry from place to place. I have more confidence using this around my smaller kids, then I do with the larger Phantoms. It&rsquo;s less spicuous to use when out in public and in parks.*Skycontroller - The Skycontroller really is the only way to use the Bebop.It has decent distance and makes the Drone much easier to use.Cons - in this order:*Price - This is the biggest concern.With the introduction of DJI Phantom 3, they have set a new standard of quality and value for your money - like it or not. The Bebop with Skycontroller currently is $899.00. The Phantom 3 Advance is $999.00 and it is incredibly superior for only a $100.00 more. It&rsquo;s like buying a Moped for $899.00 or buying a Ducati for $999.00. Are you getting it now?*Skycontroller \ Price.The Bebop without the Skycontroller is really just a ridiculously over priced $500.00 toy.Sorry it&rsquo;s true. Without the Skycontroller you don&rsquo;t have the range or distance to really use the drone seriously.. Again, think of buying a Corvette but then being told you can never leave the Cul-de-sac (dead end street) that you live on with the Corvette. Ya, it&rsquo;s exactly like that. And if you want to buy the Skycontorller separately it&rsquo;s $400 and stupendously expensive - so no win here.*Cheaply madeFor $899.00 I&rsquo;d expect Parrot to make the Bebop drone feel like I was getting a block of gold, yet instead what I got feels very cheaply made as others have stated. 2 rubber landing gear lost on it&rsquo;s maiden flight. People have complained about this from the beginning and Parrot has done nothing to fix the wrong, at least with DJI, they came out with several versions of the Phantom 2 Vision Plus, in trying to correct problems and make a better drone, but not here with the Bebop. The battery connections has to be held on with a $0.25 Velcro strap. REALLY??? A $900.00 package and I am holding the battery to my Drone with a $0.25 Velcro strap. I would of respected Parrot more if they included a role of duct-tape, but then again that cost more then $0.25 and the price of the drone might of gone up another $50 bucks.*Lastly Flight time.With the stock batteries you&rsquo;re lucky if get 7 to 11 minutes of flight time. I&rsquo;m sorry, $900.00 not acceptable for the price when Phantoms are hitting 16 to 20 minute flight times and the Yuneec Q500+ (you can now get at $999.00) can do 25 minutes of flight time. 7 minutes, 10 minutes, really not enough time to set shots you want to take video of and or pictures. It&rsquo;s just ridiculous .Would I buy this product again? No, I just can&rsquo;t for it&rsquo;s price.As much I like the Bebop and in many ways prefer it over DJI&rsquo;s Phantoms for everyday flying and want to give it 5 stars, good common sense tells me, no way - just not worth the money. If the whole package, (Bebop and Skycontroller) was $500.00 I&rsquo;d still think twice in light of the Phantom 3 Advance, but at least it would be at a price point enough to temp me if I really didn&rsquo;t know any better and had no way of getting $1,000 to buy the more expensive drones. Remember, Moped or a Ducati. But then again, sometimes it just might still be worth the save $1000.00 for the Ducati then to buy a $500 Moped.Personally, I would like to see what Parrot does with the next version of the Bebop. hopefully they will learn some lessons and, they will price more line with what they are offering in compareds to the competition and make the product with more quality so it can feel like a premium product for it&rsquo;s price.</p>

<p>The drone works great. One pf the batteries included will not cahrge, skycontroller does Not work, image coming out of HDMI on the sky controller is not working properly see picture included. Therefore I can&rsquo;t update the skycontroller.</p>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-amazingly-easy-to-fly">This thing is amazingly easy to fly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is amazingly easy to fly! We just took on a windy Oregon Coast flight. While the drone did move around in the wind quite a bit, the video was very smooth. Add a tablet onto your Skycontroller and you will have a great setup. My only complaint is the relatively short battery life on the drone (about 7 minutes each).</p>

<h5 id="met-expectations">Met Expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you choose not to read the directions. Please at least take these steps before flying it.1.Calibrate Drone2.Hit leveler button so it knows to stay level and not drift3.Make sure you have a green GPS lock before takeoffNot following anyone of those steps and you will sound like one of the 1 star reviewers underneath10-1-15I thought I would have lost it by now lol. So far I have 5 hours flight time. No problems. I am flying with the sky controler. I had one serious collision trying to land in a tight space in my back yard after a typical 1 kilometer plus trip. Ended up crashing into the side of my house and hitting my concrete patio. I replaced two propellers re-calibrated, did some low level testing and she didn&rsquo;t skip a beat. Just took a trip up this afternoon in high winds. It flew to my destination at a enormous high rate of speed and then flew it back against the wind barely getting it back before the battery died. But took some excellent video footage.I am still very happy with this purchaseGot it yesterdaySo far seems to be working in every aspectIt feels cheap with the styrophone housing but that&rsquo;s what they had to do to make it be light.I like the fact it looks like an unassuming $50 drone as people won&rsquo;t crowd around you and ooh and ahh and distract you.Although I&rsquo;m not a drone aficionado there&rsquo;s another professional drone that looks like a flying monstrosity and resembles a portable outside flying diesel generator with a large obvious camera attached.If you get this I recommend starting small and flying inside your houseIf anything changes or breaks I will update my review accordingly</p>

<h5 id="would-be-decent-with-a-smaller-transmitter">Would be decent with a smaller transmitter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hand held controller is way to large and over sized. This product has a lot of potential with all the tech slammed into one small unit. I&rsquo;m quite familiar to quads and build all my own racing 250s. I wanted this because it was small and offered cinematic capabilities that no other smaller quad can offer. However, it was all pointless when I held the Sky Controller. That thing is just HUGE! Unfortunately, the quad performs poorly on the smartphone, so for good shots, you&rsquo;re sort of limited to using the Sky Controller.I ended up returning the product due to the fact that it did not meet my needs in terms of offering a portable solution. Good potential, just need to get rid of that ridiculous Sky Controller unit.</p>
