<blockquote>
<p>This review ran a bit longer than I expected, so let me sum it up by saying that this zBoost SOHO YX545 did exactly what I needed it to. It boosts the signal quality in my house from at most 2 bars to a solid 5 and didn&rsquo;t require any complicated setup or configuration. It isn&rsquo;t often that a plug-and-play device like this truly beats out all expectations!The main thing to keep in mind during the install is that the external antenna and base station need to be seperated as much as possible. The reason for this is that they both use the same frequencies for communication, and having them close together will cause feedback. When the zBoost detects feedback, it turns down its internal antenna strength; which can seriously impact the range you will get from the zBoost.Now, on to the details:I live in a 2 story, 3000 square foot house with a radiant barrier installed in the attic. The radiant barrier is great for keeping utility costs down, but it wreaks havoc on the cell signal in the house. Because of that, I&rsquo;m lucky to get 1 or 2 bars inside, with constant missed and dropped calls, even though the signal quality outside is just fine.For the last 3 years I&rsquo;ve been working from home and using an AT&amp;T cell phone as my primary work number. This has led me to try all types of methods to boost my cell signal, and I&rsquo;m often forced to take work calls in the yard since it&rsquo;s the only place where my phone works.Last week I discovered the zBoost SOHO YX545 and decided to give it a try. One of the first things I noticed after unpacking it was that the 50&rsquo; extension cable seemed extremely thin and poorly insulated compared to a standard coax/RG6 cable. I decided I&rsquo;d use it anyway, so I headed up to the roof to find a place with a good cell signal. The antenna was extremely easy to mount - I basically used the included screws to mount it to my chimney in a place where it looked like there was a good signal.After mounting the antenna, I ran the included COAX cable down through the attic and to a central place on the first floor. I plugged it in and it started up immediately, no configuration or long boot process at all. I checked my phone and, honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t very impressed. In fact, my signal wasn&rsquo;t much better than what it had been before.At that point I was a bit frustrated, but decided not to give up yet. I went back to the roof to verify the antenna location and it turned out I hadn&rsquo;t picked a very good spot. I moved it and went back in to test again. The second time, my signal was better; but it dropped off quickly just a few feet away from the zBoost device.This whole time, the quality of the 50&rsquo; extension cable had been in the back of my mind - so I decided to replace it with a better-insulated RG6 cable. I also decided to go with a 35&rsquo; cable just to keep the cable run to a minimum. Running the replacement cable was easy enough since I just used a coax coupler to connect the cables and pulled the new cable all the way to the roof - it only took a few minutes.Once I had connected the new RG6 cable, I plugged in the zBoost and finally got the results I had been hoping for! My whole house is now bathed with a consistent 4 to 5 bar signal quality, and my cell phone calls are sounding better than they ever have before. This is one of the best investments I&rsquo;ve ever made!The entire install time was around 5 hours - and that included a trip to Home Depot. If you are just mounting the antenna outside a window, I would expect the install time to be far less. In my case, I always like to run wires through the walls and that can add quite a bit of time - especially going from the roof to the first floor.After trying every cell booster device I could find, including the 3G MicroCell from AT&amp;T (which gave good signal strength, but ended up causing far more problems than it solved), I&rsquo;ve finally found a device that solves my home&rsquo;s signal issues. I can&rsquo;t say enough good about the zBoost, and I&rsquo;m happily giving it 5 well-deserved stars.If you do buy this, here is a summary of the things that should help you get a better signal boost:1) Make sure the antenna truly is in a place that will give you a consistent signal quality. My first attempt at mounting the antenna picked a bad spot because I didn&rsquo;t realize how long my phone takes to update the signal strength meter. The second time, I held it in place for about a minute in each location to be sure I really did have a good signal.2) Keep the antenna as fully seperated from the base station as possible - open air distance won&rsquo;t work great for this, but wall and ceiling materials will. In my house, the radiant barrier actually helps the zBoost out since it keeps the base station from seeing the antenna at all.3) If your antenna and base station are well seperated and the zBoost signal still seems to be dropping off after only a few feet - try using a better insulated RG6 cable instead of the cable included with the zBoost. My suspicion is that the ultra-thin coax cable was allowing the zBoost base station and the antenna to interfere with each other, even though they were seperated by 2 ceilings, attic insulation, a roof, and the radiant barrier. Fortunately, good RG6 cables can be had for not much money at all.4) Remember that shorter cable runs are better than longer runs. For example, avoid using a 50&rsquo; coax cable for a 25&rsquo; run. Home Depot will cut cables to custom lengths, and you can probably talk most of the guys into terminating them for you if you don&rsquo;t have the tools. Otherwise, just get a pre-terminated 25&rsquo; or 50&rsquo; cable (which is still just a few bucks).Overall, I highly recommend this product. If you have a good cell signal outside, but not inside, then this is the product that will solve your connectivity problems!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in a mid sized city near 3 towers. I should get decent cell reception, but didn&rsquo;t with both Sprint and now Verizon. So I wanted to give this a try. I used their app to see where the best location was for the antenna (a fairly useful app). I also used the Android app &ldquo;Advanced Signal Status.&rdquo; Both apps were useful to get good numbers (not bars, those are almost useless) and to get a visual of which towers I was connecting to. I followed all the instructions exactly as they recommended (not sure why so many complain about their instructions, it isn&rsquo;t rocket science. And they have youtube videos, and a good manual online).The tips for setting up your antennas are:1) Place the Signal Antenna as high as possible. I chose my attic (high up, easy access, and protected from the elements). Anything that is conductive in nature will block RF. So anything metal, such as aluminum siding can inhibit cell reception. I have an asphalt shingle roof, so my signal antenna is perfect in my attic. The same rules apply to your indoor antenna. Make sure to place it where only wood is guarding you from your reception.2) IF you don&rsquo;t have reception where you are putting the signal antenna, then this product won&rsquo;t help you (they explicitly say this).3) I then put my indoor Base Unit antenna in the basement. I ran their RG-6 coax cable down to the basement (some people say they don&rsquo;t include RG-6 coax. They may not have before, but they do now), to where my indoor antenna is. They recommend at least 15 feet away. I put mine 50 feet away with their provided cable.4) I put my indoor antenna on a small shelf 2 feet above the ground (they recommend this). They also say to keep it away from your WiFi router.According to the Advanced Signal Status app, I was getting around -110dBm reception in my living room before. I now get a consistent -60dBM to -70dBm (I was getting around -80dBm in my attic, so it does boost the signal a bit). I have had this for a couple weeks now and the reception is the same. FYI, the range is -60dBm (perfect) to -120dBm (no signal). Did you know that the number of bars is subjective, and determined by the cell phone company? Don&rsquo;t believe the bars!!!My house is about 1300 square feet per floor (2 floors plus basement). I get great reception in my basement (of course since that is where the indoor antenna is) as well as on my first floor. The signal degrades a little when I go to the second floor, but is still around -80dBm. So it did work as claimed.BUT, and this is a huge BUT, I still have problems placing calls (not at the fault of zBoost). I have an HTC ONE M8 with Verizon. My dumb phone prioritizes 4G LTE as its primary connection, even though I get poor reception (around -110 dBm). It does this, despite the fact that my CDMA is flawless. Sadly the Verizon version of this phone doesn&rsquo;t let you choose CDMA only (Sprint does). So I can&rsquo;t fix this. So buyer beware, you may not be able to place calls if your dumb phone chooses LTE. I tried an app that can disable LTE, and that didn&rsquo;t work and only caused problems. I had to do a system restore to get it back.So at no fault to this product, you may not be able to place calls. My advice, get an LTE antenna booster if you use a phone that doesn&rsquo;t let you choose CDMA only.AND if anyone has any tips or advice for me, please HELP!!! I would love any suggestions. I am so tired and frustrated with poor signal quality. I don&rsquo;t want to go out and buy another antenna. I might just <em>gulp</em> get a landline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not quit smiling from the time I plugged it in, until I fell asleep that night!!!! I built a shop behind my house (metal roof and walls). I had 1-2 bars of service (AT&amp;T) (edge) outside the shop, and &ldquo;no service&rdquo; inside, ever! After installing the &ldquo;zBoost&rdquo;, I now have 5 bar 4G service in the entire 30&rsquo;X150&rsquo; shop and 3-4 bars of 4G within 30&rsquo; outside the shop. I was hoping to just get maybe 2 bars 4G close the the inside antenna, so I was very excited to get what I did. It could not be any better!!! It is perfect. I live in a small valley surrounded by 200-300&rsquo; hills all around and the closest AT&amp;T antenna is 5 miles away. I use a Micro Cell in my house because the same problem exists. I went with the zBoost because I don&rsquo;t have internet in shop. I now wish I had gone with zBoost in my house, but still very pleased with the m-Cell. Now for the part that most people cant do, but may not be required for most because I do live in a valley. I installed the zBoost external antenna on a 26 ft pole on top of my 18&rsquo; shop for a total of 44ft tall antenna. I do not know if that hight was required to get the results that I have but that was how tall the pole was so I used it. My father lives on the same ranch that I do and after seeing the results ordered one immediately! Like the site says, what ever service you have on your phone at the top of the antenna, is what it will broadcast inside the building. I had 3bars 4g just standing on the roof of the shop. I give the zBoost 5 stars because there is not an option to give the 6 I think it deserves!</p>
