<h5 id="cleans-significantly-better-than-a-manual-toothbrush-charge-lasts-3-weeks">- Cleans significantly better than a manual toothbrush - Charge lasts 3 weeks &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:- Cleans significantly better than a manual toothbrush- Charge lasts 3 weeks- Pulses to let you know when to move on to each section- Travel case is a big win. With my prior electric toothbrushes, I often ended up traveling with a manual just because I didn&rsquo;t have a convenient way to store the electric- Variety of modes is great for a whole spectrum of dental preferencesCons:- Like others have said, It&rsquo;s odd that you can&rsquo;t set the mode prior to turning it on and putting it in your mouth. It leads you to have to either count the number of times you push the button, or angle it so you can see the display in the mirror.- The instructions are very vague regarding the timer and quadrant pulses. I started with using the gum mode and thought I was following along switching quadrants every time it pulsed, but then found myself with an extra 4 or so pulses at the end that I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with. It would be nice if the instructions had a table that called out specifically when the pulses occur for each mode so we know when to move to the next section.- There&rsquo;s another model of sonicare that pulses when you push too hard. For the price of this one, I feel like it&rsquo;d be nice if it had that feature too.- The glass charger is neat and a convenient storage place, but I think I&rsquo;d prefer if it could stand straight up in its stand rather than let it lean against things.- The green charging indicator light is very dull and difficult to see in the daylight.</p>

<h5 id="this-toothbrush-is-a-beast">This toothbrush is a beast</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sonicare toothbrush is a work horse there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. If you inspect the back of your teeth you can usually see a small layer of plaque. Well the sonicare toothbrush is your answer to the best at home cleaning, after about 2 days of brushing my teeth were noticeably cleaner. My colleagues were asking me if I whitened my teeth lol, I can never go back to a manual toothbrush. 32,000 brush strokes a minute think about that. If you care about how your teeth look, then this is a great investment.</p>

<h5 id="miracle-worker-just-buy-it-already">Miracle Worker, Just Buy It Already</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is literally THE best toothbrush I&rsquo;ve used in my entire life. Worth every penny. I bought the rose gold, and it&rsquo;s gorgeous. It matches my iPhone, so that&rsquo;s cool I guess, but more so, it&rsquo;s just neat to have fancy looking tech in your bathroom that updates the place a bit. More importantly though, this thing works miracles.I already have white teeth, but I bought it because I have plaque that builds up around a permanent retainer installed behind my lower teeth after having braces in high school. Regular brushing and flossing doesn&rsquo;t remove all the food particles, and every year my dentist hounds me over it. It gets incredibly painful when she has to scrape off a year&rsquo;s worth of buildup off the area. I just bought this sucker, and in ONE use, it literally just blasted away the plaque residing on and around my retainer and teeth that had been there for about 4 months. You know that feeling after you get your teeth professionally cleaned and they&rsquo;re all smooth and shiny, and you run your tongue all over them? Same feeling as when you first got your braces off? Yeah, same exact feeling. Amazing Every single tooth feels like it was just professionally cleaned in the two minutes it took to brush my teeth this morning.Word of advice though, this thing is powerful, so I applied the toothpaste, and then turned it on before I stuck it in my mouth and toothpaste went flying. Make sure you apply the toothpaste and then place the brush up against your teeth before turning it on to avoid a mess. Also, don&rsquo;t open up your mouth while brushing to watch it work. Small flecks of paste will speckle the vicinity.I haven&rsquo;t tried any other settings yet, just the regular &ldquo;Clean&rdquo; setting, but I had beyond thrilled with this thing. Philips is on to something here. Throw out whatever you&rsquo;ve got now, because it doesn&rsquo;t come close to this.</p>

<h5 id="great-clean-for-design-not-so-much">Great Clean, for Design Not so Much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Philips HX939W feels great in the hand and provides a superior tooth-cleaning experience. One reason I bought it to replace my obsolescent Philips brush was the name &ndash; using Diamond Clean brushes had always given me a great clean, with smooth teeth like you get from a dentist. This new model is multi-functional, up to 3900 rpm, and comes also with an advanced brush which I use alternately with a Diamond Clean. You can charge the head by setting it in a provided glass, sort of nice. I don&rsquo;t use the glass for other purposes. The system also comes with attachment so you can connect to your laptop to charge while traveling (I don&rsquo;t need that) and a small travel bag (I don&rsquo;t need that). What the system does not provide is something I wanted but had to purchase separately from Philips &ndash; a small container that holds two brushes and dries them with ultra-violet light, which is almost a requirement for storage in the bathroom. So, I would give five stars for end results, but three stars for product design, averaging out to a four. This should last for years.</p>

<h5 id="supreme-clean">Supreme Clean!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely worth every cent! My old Sonicare died after a long life so I couldn&rsquo;t wait to re-order for deep clean. Manual brushing just does not compare at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great investment. Just buy it. You will feel the difference</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am impressed by the fast delivery. However, when I opened the box, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a brand new product. It probably has been sold to someone and tried. I am returning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-toothbrush">Best Toothbrush!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is got to the best toothbrush I&rsquo;ve ever owned. It makes my teeth feel so clean I highly recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="diamond-head-toothbrushes">Diamond head toothbrushes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had another diamond head before, I liked it much better. It was easier to change the speed of the brush. I also liked the cleaning system much better.</p>

<p>My daughter-in-law recommended this (she got one for Christmas) and she was right! It really does make your teeth feel like they were just cleaned at the dentist&rsquo;s office every&hellip;</p>

<p>Like all Sonicare models the Philips Sonicare HX939V turns off automatically after a certain length of time, and that time is divided into shorter segments to help you make sure&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-the-best">Absolutely the Best!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had a full mouth restoration for over 20 years. After the restoration my dentist insisted on use of a powered toothbrush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-much-better-clean">a much better clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>using this has given me a much better cleaning for my teeth, and hopefully my next check-up goes much easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-i-ve-ever-had">The Best I&rsquo;ve Ever Had!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This replaced an older Sonicare that lasted a good 6 years or so. I really like the new design and it cleans great. The wireless charging cup/stand is a very neat idea.</p>
