<h5 id="one-main-reason-why-this-tactical-vest-is-way-better-than-anyyyyyyyy-others-i-have-found">ONE MAIN REASON WHY THIS TACTICAL VEST IS WAY BETTER THAN ANYYYYYYYY OTHERS I HAVE FOUND!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>***********************<strong><em>THIS VEST IS IN THE PIKE&hellip; 5X5</em></strong>**************************Reasons why this is better than most other vests in its class:I like that the right butt shoulder rest has a semi-firm tube that extends up the shoulder all the way up thereby adding extra absorption for a shotgun butt and that its not a soft cheapy impotent feeling support like other saggy type foam inserts. Your hydration tube WILL hold securely to this one!I like that the outer upper mag clip slots have a nice feel to them, sort of a thick rubberized texture and rugged and not just a vinyl feel or look.The belt is EXTREMELY FIRM which adds support like a tool belt type and doesn&rsquo;t bunch up or spot sag like many do. The design on the hook and loop size adjustment is nice because it is on both sides so you keep the belt centered.The shoulder straps are wide strong adjustable hook and loop and give great overall support to the vest once weighted down.Now here is what makes this vest WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER:What I really REALLY REALLY like about the inside back &lsquo;BLADDER&rsquo; slot is it will fit on the back perfectly an 11&rdquo;x14&rdquo;to15&rdquo; KEVLAR INSERT&hellip; PERFECTLY!!!!!!!! Now THAT my friends you gotta admit that this is a Bad @$$ OPTION!!!It has a Velcro closure to keep it packed solid. You can buy the raw Kevlar IIIA insert for about $60 bucks, if not here then &ldquo;E&rdquo;lseware. In the inside front gut area is on each side of zipper are (2) 8&rdquo;x10&rdquo; zippered panels for Kevlar IIIA Inserts costing $36 apiece &ldquo;E&rdquo;lseware!!!! Now, for full on protection you will want and need to create a simple upper &ldquo;T&rdquo; shaped sleeve insert that will hold Kevlar IIIA that will cover the full wide top heart chest area and that will extend down the zipper center about 4&rdquo; wide to under lap the gut side panels and then you effectively have a full flac that is A LOT MORE LOWER PROFILE and even better than buying another vest and wearing it underneath!!!!!!!!!! And not to mention MUCH MUCH less cha-ching than buying a separate vest. What is really nice is that the material on the inner vest sleeves front and back is an open mesh material that is rugged yet helps function to keep you a tad bit cooler than if you had solid material up against your undershirt. Those under-mesh types of shirts are pricey and bulky and this has it built in all over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This concept effectively turns this Vest into a $1000 Vest in my humble opinion!The Velcro everywhere is pretty tight hook n loop and is not the MOST expensive on the market I have found but it is as good and better as any other quality typical vest on the market that I have found in this class. You do not need better than I think.The sides have three &ldquo;PULL&rdquo; tabs each and make it really nice to custom secure your vest depending on the undergarment thickness and depending on if you put your Kevlar Inserts in or not . Probably the best side design I have seen for quick sizing. I would prefer to have Velcro on the tab ends so they may be folded back to secure onto the vest back so they are not flopping around so they are not so easily grabbed in a combat situation. I am 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; 190 pounds and there are effectively 4 more inches of room on each side(8 inches total) when these are both fully extended on me beyond the 2 inches on each side (4 inches total) I pulled out and sized on me already without the Kevlar inserts.The six shotgun ammo secure slots are tight thick stretch material that should not wear out easily. It is affixed via its hook n loop and can be worn outside the also removable or adjustable hook n loop upper chest pocket or AS A GREAT BONUS may also be secured on the inside of the pocket to hold things from rattling around depending on your preference.The vest will hold four average assault gun magazines and a total of six hand gun magazines! The Velcro is VERY generously sized on ALL pockets, very secure!The back has a very large 6 horizontal x 4 vertical strip webbing which are fantastic because if you use the internal slots for Kevlar then you can attach a bladder and more to the exterior webbing.There is a very large bumper sticker sized hook n loop on the back upper that can be taken to an embroider or you can iron on your necessary or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; (&ldquo;DEPLORABLE1&rdquo; is my) statement (Thanks Hillary For The Idea!). Alternately you could affix a large machete sideways to it for quick deploy in a combat situation, only of course if you warn the perp first that &ldquo;they will not get that hand back&rdquo;&hellip; ;).The holster holds my Beretta 92FS LE INOX Police Special 9mm Semi Automatic Pistol Perfectly and it is a longer pistol than others so it should hold just about any reputable semi auto. The Baretta fills it out well but it deploys flawlessly and smoothly! The gun holster holds very solidly to your gut because it is not just Velcro but also two adjustable straps so you can custom tilt it, one above and one to the left side that keep it from being ripped off. The holster is open at the side end allowing for various sized barrels and some silencer tips can be slid through&hellip; &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo;.The zipper is thick and smooth but not too smooth. Time will only tell if it will stay of or if it will need a velcro under tab affix&hellip; we shall see.If there was one downside to this and its not really a downside to many, it would be that the cell phone carrier on the left shoulder upper is too small for most wider android touch screen cell phones however it does fit a thin flip phone very nicely and might fit some thinner phones and it would stretch the sides out to fit most and I am not so sure if the upper Velcro closure would be long enough to close once filled depending on how long your phone is. it would be good for an Ipod or etc. Sadly the pouch is not removable but then it is so small that if it was it might easily fall off in a combat situation, soooooooo&hellip;All in all this is WAY MORE vest than you could ever hope to buy for the money!!! I say pull the trigger on this one!BUYERS NOTE: I bought this vest with my own funds and have not been compensated for this review.SELLERS NOTE: I am open to reviewing other products for you so contact me if you have any other great items for review!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. If my review was helpful to you please let me know, I like to give in depth reviews for my brothers and sisters who are ON the ready&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="brilliant-vest">Brilliant vest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> As a lightweight, tactical vest, this is a cracker. It comes in one size, which is a great plus. So no matter your size, this vest will do you fine.Do not be mistakes into thinking that this is a Flak jacket or the likes. It’s purely a multi accessory, multi use vest. If you are into Airsoft or paintballing then this vest is for you. Alternatively, if you are in the law enforcement or security business, this is a useful addition to your kit.The vest is mounted of a nylon mesh giving it both ventilation and a lighter weight. It zips up the front and has 2 straps down each side for fitting it to your body. It will also adjust at the shoulder, which a lot of these vests do not. I have a very light body mass and I got this vest to fit perfectly in no time, and with no effort, at all.Starting on the inside of the vest, there are 2 zip up pockets left and right. These may be useful for documentation or similar. The mesh used is strong and lightweight. To the rear of the body you have a reinforced pull handle for cell extraction or rescue. There is a compartment for a hydration bladder. I’m not sure what size you can get in there though. On the hydration bladder compartment there are some Molle straps for attaching additional items.There are also magazine/torch pouches. On the upper back is a large Velcro area where you can put your company or personal patches.To the front of the vest are a radio/phone pouch on the left shoulder. Just below that there is a removable 3-pocket pistol mag pouch. Again this would be useful for magazines/torch or for batteries. Below this is the removable pistol holster. This is what it is and I don’t see that you could use it for anything else. On the other side of the vest there is a shotgun shell pouch and this has 2 large utility pouches underneath it. Attached to the bottom of the vest is a heavy duty adjustable belt which is removable and can be used as a standalone item.The materials used in the manufacture of this product are of a high quality and I can see this vest lasting a long time even if you put it through the mill and use and abuse it. It is extremely comfortable to wear and I am sure that during long time wear you won’t even know you have it on. The accessories that come with the vest are also very well made and being able to add and take away from the vest is a great asset.A top class product from a top class seller. Yakeda always come up trumps with their good and I would recommend this vest to future buyers.Declaration: I received this product without charge, without obligation, in the hope that I might review it. This has not affected my assessment of it – it remains objective and unbiased. One of the reasons I have taken a number of photos is that I do not want you to take my word for what it is like – I want you to judge for yourself.If you&rsquo;ve found this review to be helpful please click on the button below.</p>

<h5 id="seems-like-a-great-vest-at-a-great-price-but-it-does-not-fit-my-chest">Seems like a great vest at a great price, but it does not fit my chest.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great vest. I really like it except for one thing. It does not fit. I am 5&rsquo; 11 and weigh 220 lbs and wear an XL T shirt. The waist fits with plenty of room, but the chest does not. I extended the straps as far as I could but I cannot zip it up. I might try putting extensions on the straps if I get a chance or hope to lose 20 or 30 lbs. From everything I read in the questions section, this should have fit me. If it fit, i would have given it a 5.</p>

<h5 id="great-vest">Great vest!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great vest! It has tons of pockets and storage and is very versatile with strong Velcro adjustable sections. It is also very adjustable for size. I am a big guy at 275 pounds. I wear a 54 R coat. The vest and belt were adjustable to fit me comfortably. It also can fit a much smaller person. Super cool looking. Love it.</p>
