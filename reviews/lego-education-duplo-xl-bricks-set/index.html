<h5 id="huge-set-of-duplo-legos-with-good-variety">Huge set of Duplo Legos with good variety</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great set of Duplo Legos that contains a ton of bricks and a nice variety of pieces. It has standard bricks (2x4 bricks, 2x4 plates, 2x2 bricks) in 7 different colors: yellow, red, dark blue, light blue, orange, dark green and light green. It also has various special pieces: 16 fences, 6 windows, 9 cars, 8 people, curved pieces, 2x2 with eyes, 1 hook, 1 ladder, 2 8x16 plates and a partridge in a pear tree.I could not find this information online, so here is the inventory breakdown of my LEGO Education DUPLO XL Bricks Set 779090 (560 Pieces) set:2x10 brick - 1 (1 green)2x6 brick - 6 (2 red, 2 dark blue, 1 yellow, 1 dark green)2x4 brick - 120 (26 dark blue, 20 dark green, 20 red, 24 yellow, 10 orange, 10 light blue, 10 light green)2x2 brick - 230 (40 dark blue, 50 dark green, 40 red, 40 yellow, 20 orange, 20 light blue, 20 light green)2x4 plates - 76 (12 dark blue, 10 dark green, 12 red, 12 yellow, 10 orange, 10 light blue, 10 light green)2x2 eyes - 6 (2 dark green, 2 yellow, 2 red)2x3 curve - 40 (10 red, 10 yellow, 10 dark green, 10 dark blue)2x3 tall curve - 12 (4 dark green, 4 yellow, 2 red, 2 dark blue)2x4 double brick height - 2 (2 red)2x4 with table legs - 2 (2 red)People - 8 (2 of each character)Cars - 9 (3 dark blue, 3 yellow, 3 red)Ladder - 1 (that can be used on a fire truck)Crane hook - 1 (that can be used on a tow truck)Windows - 6 (red external frame with white internal frame)Ovals - 4 (2 dark blue, 2 yellow)Semi-circles - 4 (2 red, 2 yellow)Fences - 24 (8 dark blue, 8 yellow, 8 red)6x12 plates - 2 (2 red)I also uploaded a bunch of pictures here on Amazon showing the box they come in, the packages before opening, a plastic bin filled with them, a mostly unorganized pile of pieces and then an organized shot with notes for all pieces.Happy constructing!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="update-seems-expensive-but-your-kids-will-play-with-these-for-years">UPDATE Seems expensive, but your kids will play with these for years.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATEMy kids are now 4 and 7, and they both still loves playing with these Duplos. Additionally, the duplos are basically indestrucible. Heavy use and abuse by 2 boys and they still look like new. Also, waterproof. Again, with 2 boys, this is a very nice feature.This is an awesome set, it&rsquo;s outlasted all other &ldquo;closed ended&rdquo; toys. My kids keep playing with these (and other open ended toys) because the toys can morph and keep up with their imaginations. The longest lasting toys in our house: Duplos, regular Legos, Melissa &amp; Doug 60-Piece Standard Unit Blocks,CitiBlocs 300-Piece Natural-Colored Building Blocks and Magna-Tiles Clear Colors 100 Piece Set. These toys have all lasted several years, and the kids still come back to them. Sure, if a new closed ended toy with bright ligts comes along they&rsquo;ll be fascinated and play with it for a while, but soon enough, that toy is disgarded and they always come back to their open ended toys.********************************************This is a great Lego set. It has lots of wheel base units - 9. I have found that the wheel base units are the most used pieces in any Lego set. 95% of the creations my kids build incorporate at least one wheel set.Duplos works for my 2 year old and 5 year old. The traditional Legos are too small for my 2 year old, and a choking hazard. But the Duplos are fine.Don&rsquo;t think that Duplos are only for toddlers! My 5 year old loves to play with these as much as the traditional Legos. Maybe even more. If you buy this set when your kid is 12-18 months, you will likely get at least 4-6 years of use out of it. How many toys can you say that about? When you think about the longevity of the toy, it makes the $200 investment much more palatable.Also, this encourages creativity and the kids must engage in the toy. And I LOVE that it&rsquo;s not battery powered.Overall, i think this is one of the best toy investments you can make.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="lego-s-are-real-tactile-require-planning-inspire-design-develop-visual-and-dimensional-acuity">Lego&rsquo;s are real, tactile, require planning, inspire design, develop visual and dimensional acuity.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best bang for your buck, you get a very nice mix of 560 pieces and my son loves the little cars and people that came with it. At first he started by only dismantling what I made for him, but when I am not around I started noticing that he has been attaching pieces together and making his own little things, which is exactly what we want to inspire in him. Lego duplo&rsquo;s are in my opinion one of the few toys that allow parents and toddlers to have meaningful play time together. You can&rsquo;t go wrong they are real, tactile, require planning, inspire design, develop visual and dimensional acuity and Lego&rsquo;s are virtually indestructible. This thing will keep your kid busy for years. OH&hellip;. and it&rsquo;s not some brain rotting, social deprivation app on a stupid tablet or phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-duplo-set">Great DUPLO Set!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I saved many of the Duplo blocks from 30 years ago when my sons played with them. I ordered this set for my grandchildren and to supplement those 30 year old Duplos I already had.They will love it, there really are a lot of blocks, some in new colors like light blue and orange. This set also included 9 train cars which I know my grandson will love. The set exceeded my expectations and I was very pleased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lots-of-duplo">Lots of DUPLO</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While this set is listed under the Lego Education Series it is a good companion set if your young children (under 4) like building and tearing down their creations. There is some duplication as the set is supposed to support a group of students but there is a good number of 2x4 pieces to offset the lack thereof in many of the other Duplo sets. The number of pieces greatly increases the possibilities of what can be built by children as they get accustomed to the infinite combinations of Lego pieces.Great buy in my opinion for a group or a couple of children.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wear-missing-parts">Wear，missing parts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lego pieces of serious wear and tear, and missing parts a door, a very unpleasant a shopping experience! There is no listing, temporary not clear whether other pieces missing</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-box-is-huge-it-ll-surprise-you-when-you-cover-your-floor-with-em">This box is huge! It&rsquo;ll surprise you when you cover your floor with em.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We build with Duplo train sets, these bulk blocks help take our layouts vertical. We can now elevate large portions of our track, and can still make several decent sized buildings to go with. Our kids play with both Lego and Duplo, sometimes together.</p>

<h5 id="never-go-wrong">Never go wrong.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My girls have been using these about once a week for the last two years.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-not-only-for-children-grown-s-have-lots-of-fun-too">It is not only for children grown&rsquo;s have lots of fun too.</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a waderful set of duplos. It is not only for children grown&rsquo;s have lots of fun too.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have">A must have!</h5>

<p>Totally awesome! A must have for your Duplo lego collections. A good buy and nice assortment.</p>

<p>It was the best decision we made to buy this product from Amazon. As we opened the box, my kids screamed out of happiness to see so many LEGO pieces and they played all day&hellip;</p>
