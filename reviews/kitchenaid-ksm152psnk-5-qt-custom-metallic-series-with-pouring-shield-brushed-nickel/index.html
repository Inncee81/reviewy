Product Description
The KitchenAid Custom Metallic Series Stand Mixer is available in three striking finishes for the one that perfectly complements your kitchen design. Easily make your favorite cakes and multiple batches of cookie dough with the 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl with comfort handle. With 10 speeds, the stand mixer will quickly become your kitchen’s culinary center as you mix, knead and whip ingredients with ease. For even more versatility, the power hub fits optional attachments from food grinders to pasta makers and more.</p>

<p>Amazon.com
KitchenAid&rsquo;s Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child&rsquo;s play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman&rsquo;s bowling ball, this stand mixer isn&rsquo;t the sort of appliance you&rsquo;ll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged&ndash;you&rsquo;ll want to show it off. &ndash;Betsy Danheim</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>The Artisan mixer&rsquo;s strong 325-watt motor delivers the power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mix large batches easily.</p>

<p>The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl with ergonomic handle is big enough to handle large batches of heavy mixtures. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable.</p>

<p>Unique Mixing Action</p>

<p>The beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise; moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This unique mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl.</p>

<p>Multiple Speeds</p>

<p>10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job; from very high to very slow stir. It&rsquo;s easy to select the precise speed needed for a perfect mix.</p>

<p>Versatile Accessories
The flat beater, dough hook, and the professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. The flat beater is the ideal accessory for mixing normal to heavy batters. From cake mixes to firm cookie dough, the flat beater mixes quickly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>The dough hook mixes and kneads yeast dough, saving both time and the effort of hand-kneading. The wire whip incorporates the maximum amount of air in whipped mixtures for fluffier whipped cream and angel food cakes.</p>

<p>All attachments are solidly constructed, and attach easily to the stand mixer.</p>

<p>Easy Clean Up</p>

<p>The pouring shield fits around the top of the bowl and prevents ingredient splash-out. The chute makes it convenient and easy to add ingredients.</p>

<p>The tilt-back mixer head allows for easy access to bowl and beaters. A lock lever holds the mixer head securely in place and the bowl fastens tightly to the base.</p>

<p>Optional Attachments
Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-unit">Very Nice Unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got it so can make no comment on reliability which obviously is key for the long run. However this design has been in use for decades and it is heavy and seems built like a tank. The controls are straight forward too with no fancy lights, LED displays or gimmicks. The lock down was surprising in that when I put the head down I was sure I had hit the bottom of the bowl it was so solid but it had not. Clearance to the bowl is amazingly close which is good. It runs fairly quiet too. I did a lot of research and at least for my purpose the tilt head model was a good balance of strength and size. It is surprisingly compact and fits under the shelves on the counter even with he head up and leaves plenty of working room. I realize this model is much higher priced than the standard model. The difference is in the finish. The standard finish is a powder coat which is basically a melted baked on if you will type of material not unlike a hard plastic. Very durable and can be done in a number of colors. And a good choice. This series (I have the brushed nickel) is actual metal bonded to the unit via what I assume is an electrolysis process like the chrome on a car. It provides an almost bullet proof finish that is very durable but requires time for the process to work and the use of actual metal to bond to the surface hence the high price. For what it is worth it matched the stainless appliances (stainless is part nickel) exactly and should provide the same durability. Very nice unit and well worth it!</p>

<p>Oh my goodness - l really enjoy this mixer! Easy to use and clean up afterwards. Does my bread kneading as well as I do! Saves me time, too.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had the mixer for a month, but I love it. I plan on having her for a very long time. I have been waiting 14 years to get one and my hubby finally got me this one for my birthday in October. I named her Molly the Mixer. I fell in love with the chrome finish. She was a little more expensive because of her color but totally worth it!! I like this model with the head tilt better then the lift because I have more space to pour in the I ingredients. She&rsquo;s beautiful and matches all the stainless steel appliances. I would recommend her to anyone! Happy mixing.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-addition-to-any-kitchen-very-useful-and-great-looking">A great addition to any kitchen&ndash;very useful and great looking.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! Love it! Met all of my expectations! I leave it on my kitchen counter all the time&ndash;it is so gorgeous. And my 11 year-old grandson has taken an interest in cooking now. He especially loves the ice cream maker. He has made lots of muffins using this mixer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-copper">Pretty Copper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the copper exterior but the locking mechanism to keep the head down while it&rsquo;s running is either too loose or not made properly. Will not stay locked. I also had to buy off market mixing attachments to reach the sides of the bowl while mixing&hellip;. so&hellip; it&rsquo;s pretty, it&rsquo;s powerful, but has some flaws and not worth the $400 price tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kitchenaid-custom-metallic-mixer">KitchenAid Custom Metallic Mixer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely amazing and it looks wonderful in my kitchen. It works like a champ very heavy duty. It is the top of the line for me.</p>

<h5 id="kitchenaid-mixer-best-in-the-world">KitchenAid Mixer Best in the World</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently reviewed the purchase of this mixer in white that I bought for my daughter. I purchased this one for my wife, it is our second one. The first I bought for her 29 years ago. I bought it in white back then. The first one has been used regularly because my wife is a very good cook. We kept waiting for the old one to die, well with KitchenAid, that never happens. So after 32 years of marriage I bought her the Brushed Nickel KSM152PSNK. If you do not have a KitchenAid mixer and you like to cook, you need one. Spend the money and buy one. I know we will get at least 32 years of service from our new one.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-it-if-you-plan-to-knead-bread-dough">DON&rsquo;T BUY IT IF YOU PLAN TO KNEAD BREAD DOUGH</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mixer is advertised as a good product for kneading bread dough: &ldquo; 10 Speed SettingsPowerful enough for nearly any task or recipe, whether you’re stirring wet and&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-pay-extra-for-the-metal-finish">Don&rsquo;t pay extra for the metal finish.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my favorite kitchen appliance ever. I always wanted one and saw that Martha Stewart had the stainless steel one, so I had to have it because she&rsquo;s my idol.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="finish-doesn-t-last">Finish doesn&rsquo;t last</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed in this. I love copper and couldn&rsquo;t resist this finish but it has turned black and no amount of cleaning is fixing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-gorgeous-worth-it">Absolutely gorgeous &amp; worth it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfectly beautiful! I&rsquo;ve wanted this copper mixer since I was a little girl 50 years ago. I don&rsquo;t know the brand name, but my grandmother and I saw a copper mixer in a store.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="refurbished-returned-not-new">Refurbished, Returned&hellip;.Not New.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mixer was either a returned item or re-furbished. Not in original packaging. The item is very heavy so I have kept and used rather than go through the hassle of returning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="chrome-is-awesome">Chrome is awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally worth it to upgrade to the chrome look. Works great. No issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-gift">Nice Gift.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this for my daughter as a early Christmas gift. She really likes it.</p>
