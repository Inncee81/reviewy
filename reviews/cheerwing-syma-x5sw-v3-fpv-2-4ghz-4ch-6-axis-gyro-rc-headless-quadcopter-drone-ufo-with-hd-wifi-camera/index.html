<li>Headless/IOC function. Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using Headless/IOC, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction. This lessens the steepness of the learning curve and allows the pilot to enjoy flight while slowly learning each specific orientation of the quadcopter.</li>

<h5 id="my-favorite-thing-in-the-world">MY FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do I start with this? All I can say is, THIS. IS. MY. BABY. I have loved this thing since the moment I laid eyes on it. Having been my first drone I was very nervous to start out with a $50 drone because you see all those fancy shmancy drones that your friends use and that are on YouTube videos and you hope you can just get one for $50 to start out. Well let me tell you, this it the PERFECT beginner-intermediate drone. I mean, this thing is AWESOME.The drone can easily be used indoors and outdoors but I HIGHLY recommend hours and hours of indoor use before going outside. My worst nightmare was my first outdoor flight when I was visiting in Louisiana. I didn&rsquo;t realize how important headless mode was and flew this baby to the tippity top of a 60 foot tree. And I mean this thing was STUCK and the tree was literally un-climbable. It took three hours, a spool of 30lb fishing line, 6 fishing weights, a sling shot and about 200 shots to get it down and there was barely a scratch on it. If that doesn&rsquo;t scream durable. I don&rsquo;t know what does.Having learned my lesson from the crash I spent a lot more time on my skills indoors before attempting again in a big, clear backyard and that&rsquo;s when I was REALLY impressed. This thing goes up at least 100 feet and is s controllable. The camera function is not High Def by ANY means but it is still fun and is impressive to friends and family. Especially the live viewing. It&rsquo;s not perfect and lags by .5-2 seconds but it&rsquo;s still really neat. The flips are fun and really make people have a good time watching you fly a piece of plastic around the yard. I have crashed on concrete, grass, trees and from high elevation and this thing is still just as good as new.I recommend immediately purchasing a few batteries that are 1000mah and higher as it will extend your flight time from about 5 minutes to 12-15 minutes per battery. You&rsquo;re gonna want that. I also purchased an extra set of propellers, propeller guards and screws as you will lose/damage yours eventually. I have a black X5SW that came with white propeller guards so I made sure the new ones were all black and they look even better and more legit.ONE THING TO REMEMBER: The propellers have to go back on in the exact direction as the picture of the unit. I removed the propellers to take it on a plane and then put them back on and thought I ruined my drone. I was devastated them read online about the directional requirement of the propellers and switched them to the correct positions.I like the controller a lot and have found that you do not need to adjust trim levels or anything very much. Just resetting after crashes is advised.Don&rsquo;t get discouraged if you find the flight to be too difficult in the beginning. It takes a lot of getting used to because it&rsquo;s an aerial RC device, not and RC car. I promise you&rsquo;ll get it soon.All-in-all this is a wonderful addition to my life and I hope to add a few nano and higher end drones in the future. But for now. I am more than content with this Syma X5SW.</p>

<p>This thing is a TANK! I have beat the living crap out of this thing and it takes it all like a champ. I have crashed into beams, cranes, walls and even nose-dived into concrete on the ground and it bounced back into hovering. I would not consider myself an expert flyer but I try to do all the high-speed maneuvers that an expert would do and I dont always excute very well, which usually means crashing. The FPV camera function is pretty neat, slight lag but no biggie. Down to the meat and taters:Cons:FPV LagsNot the greatest flyer in the wind with the prop guards and landing gear on. (take them off and you see a big difference in its stability &amp; handling)Sometimes it can take up to 15 seconds for the transmitter to connect to the drone.Controller seems a little on the cheap side.Only comes with one battery and a charger that takes forever to charge. (Order the Combo: T439 Charger w/ 5 3.7V / 700mAh batteries and this reduces to about 30 minutes plus you then have 6 batteries worth of fly time!)Pros:The thing is a freaking tank!easy &amp; quick to learn how to flyDoes the most rad flips you will ever see!Great maneuvering &amp; controlGreat Price point! Best bang for your buck!FPV for live video as you are flying. (Not to mention it is a 2MP camera so the quality isnt too terrible)Headless functionProgramable modesTrim features to stabilize flight betterDid I mention it is indestructible? As hard as I have crashed it you would think it is made out of titanium and is bullet proof. (Which makes me really want to test that theory&hellip;)And now for the Gravy on top of it all:You are spending about $60 to have a fully functional &amp; fully awesome drone with all of the features that the high dollars ones have minus the kick in the wallet. If you want to get serious and fly it outside on a windy day and be completely still with video you are going to have to spend some more money. If you want to get into flying and learning how to run these things and shoot some video while doing it, this is your best choice on the market. You wouldnt go to the store expecting to buy a 80&rdquo; flat screen for the price of a 15&rdquo; would you? If you are looking for something that is extremely precise and stable enough to be really serious with some video then you better pull out your checkbook. For all other needs, this is the one.P.S. Did I mention this thing is a tank?????</p>

<h5 id="way-more-fun-than-i-expected">Way More Fun than I Expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my son&rsquo;s 9th birthday. Knowing that it would require a little finesse to fly, I tested it out before giving it to him. So. Much. Fun. Of course, I had it stuck in a tree within five minutes of unboxing it. I&rsquo;m happy to report that a few swift tosses of a soccer ball dislodged it. It took all this abuse without any ill effect.Out of the box, it was easy to assemble and set up. Flying it was actually a little easier than I expected. My 9-yr-old is able to do it, though he still needs a little practice to land it smoothly on hard surfaces. It handles trees and 9-year-old zeal with grace. The neighborhood kids like me to chase them around the yard with it. It&rsquo;s a hit. Absolutely worth the money.The flight time is as advertised, if not a little better than 7 minutes if you&rsquo;re just cruising around at low altitude. I bought exrta batteries and a charger on the cheap (here: BTG 3.7V 600mAh Battery 4PCS &amp; 4 In 1 X4 Battery Charger for Syma X5C-1 X5SW X5SC X5SC-1 X5C X5A) to extend the fun. I also got a set of extra blades for next to nothing (here: Syma X5 X5C Main Blades Propellers Spare Part X5-02), which was unnecessary since the copter comes with an extra set and we haven&rsquo;t managed to harm the original set.The camera is not great, kind of a novelty, so we usually fly without it to get the extra flight time (less weight). That&rsquo;s really the only complaint I have. It really is a ton of fun to fly. For the price (about $75 with extra batteries and props), it&rsquo;s cheaper than taking the family to the movies after popcorn and drinks, and worth many more entertainment hours.</p>
