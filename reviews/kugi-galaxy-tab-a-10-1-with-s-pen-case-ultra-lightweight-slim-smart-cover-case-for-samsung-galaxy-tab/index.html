<h5 id="thanks-kugi-for-making-these-available">Thanks KuGi for making these available.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first started looking for a case for my Tab A 10.1 this KuGi case was one of the few that were showing up. I liked the looks of the case, but without actually having one in my hands it was still a bit of a dice roll as to whether or not it would be something I&rsquo;d like or whether it would leave me disappointed. My biggest complaint about this particular case at the point that I was looking for it was that the availability date seemed to be a bit unpredictable and was forecasted to be longer off in the future than I&rsquo;d prefer. I had guesstimated that these would be available earlier than forecast, but it was going to be a bit delayed based on when the tablets were originally available.As it turned out, I ordered a Fintie case for my tablet before I placed the order for this case. That Fintie tablet was promised to be available in just a few days and I didn&rsquo;t want to wait too long before I&rsquo;d have a case to put the tablet in. On the Fintie, I didn&rsquo;t care as much for how the tablet is held in the case. There&rsquo;s more of a lip that goes around the bezel of the case that I find distracting and somewhat annoying. That lip doesn&rsquo;t exist on this KuGi case and that definitely gives this case a higher rating for me than the Fintie case.I like that this case is fairly light and yet protective. It easily holds the tablet in place, and provides a nice cover to the device that keeps it from being scratched, getting dusty, etc. With this particular case, which was designed for the tablet with the S pen, there&rsquo;s a nice cut out for the S pen that allows it to easily be taken out and used on the Tablet screen.Pricing point for this case is quite reasonable, and this particular manufacturer&rsquo;s case is available in multiple colors that offer choice to potential buyers.4 very solid stars from me. Thanks KuGi for making these available.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-and-pretty-sturdy">Pretty and pretty sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Relatively sturdy. I&rsquo;m not sure it would do too much to protect in a fall, but works well in a carry bag to protect the screen. It fits my tablet perfectly and I love that it activates the automatic on/off of the tablet. It also props itself up fairly well, and when it&rsquo;s not at an angle that works, it easily fits in a stand. Fun butterfly motif (I usually get all purple for covers, but decided to stray just a little and this still has enough purple that people know it&rsquo;s mine).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-basic-tablet-case">A Good Basic Tablet Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really do like this case a lot. It&rsquo;s solid and the Tab A10.1 with s-pen snaps right in for a perfect fit. It gives you full access to the screen and does not depend on elastic straps or Velcro to keep it in place. The cover is designed to fold into thirds allowing you to set the tablet at two angles. It rests nicely at both angles and is very stable. The magnets work great when folding back the cover. They automatically fall into place. The magnets are quite strong. They are the reason I didn&rsquo;t give this cover a five star rating. There are times when I have problems actually opening the cover because of my arthritis. This is not a drawback but more of an inconvenience. The other two issues may be problems for some. When the cover is folded back and you want to change the angle, the magnets will at times turn the tablet off. Because the cover is segmented, it will flex along the folds. This allows the tablet to turn on without the cover being opened.Overall, it does a good job of protecting my tablet from the everyday bumps and bangs along with the occasional fall from my tote or being thrown from the seat of the car to the floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-value-case-with-a-few-issues">Excellent value case with a few issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m impressed with the quality feel of the case. It actually feels like I got my money&rsquo;s worth out of it. Fits the Tab A w/ S Pen snugly. It protects the screen, and the cover isn&rsquo;t prone to flop open with the addition of magnets in the side of the case.My only two minor gripes are that I believe using four partitions instead of three on the folding cover would allow a more stable, reliable folding stand. The three partitions are essentially held together by magnets and friction, not by full contact like a forth partition would add. It just makes it slightly inconvenient, so it&rsquo;s not a BIG deal. It&rsquo;s only a $10 case.And finally, the minor of the two gripes, there&rsquo;s some flashing left over from the manufacturing process that can feel a bit sharp, although I bet some emery paper or fine sandpaper would solve that issue no problem.Don&rsquo;t let the stars make you look elsewhere. This is an excellent case with great value that is worth every bit of the $10. It feels like it should be $50.</p>

<h5 id="fits-nicely-and-performs-as-advertised">Fits nicely and performs as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits nicely and performs as advertised.My only issue is that when using while standing you have to fold back the cover and it blocks the camera. This is a design issue with any of these fold-able cases not just this manufacturer &hellip; just an FYI</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-cover">Nice little cover</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit is really nice, tablet snaps right in and seems like it will stay there. The stand option seems to hold the tablet up just fine at a bit of an angle. The magnet seems like it will hold the cover closed well. I bought the green one, and it does not auto sleep/wake, but really not that big of deal, its just a button push after all, and even if you forget the tablets going to sleep anyways shortly after you stop using it. I&rsquo;d say its worth the price.just a side comment, but others have mentioned a &ldquo;smell&rdquo;, mine did not have any odor that i noticed at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-affordable-protection">Great, Affordable Protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works extremely well to keep my Tab protected, and the sleep / wake magnet functionality has been working flawlessly. It does add a bit of weight, but nothing too noteworthy. I like the heft, actually.The only reason I&rsquo;m not giving it 5 stars is because the top is very wobbly when folded into the standing position. In &ldquo;typing&rdquo; mode or movie-watching mode, I have to be careful to not bump the table or move the tablet, as the stand portion will collapse on me. Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, though.This case is quite nice!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better than anything Samsung made, in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Magnetic came off after only a few weeks had to hot glue back on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-recommend">I would recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product came on time and its as described, the only reason I gave it a 4 star is because you really have to work with it for it to stand on its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-protection">Super protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great case holds up very well even with daily use. The material is very sturdy and doesn&rsquo;t stain at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful tablet. It is a must-have love the S Pen</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-okay">Just okay.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is of mediocre quality, it works but nothing to get excited about. S pen is awkward to get out and only supports the tablet upright half the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-liked-it-too-much">I liked it too much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>High quality, I liked it too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good case for minimalistic look</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-alternative">Good alternative</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good quality</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-cute-perfect-fit">SO CUTE, PERFECT FIT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I say? It is a perfect fit, it allows accessibility for my S Pen, camera, flash, and all ports. It has a super cute Owl design.</p>
