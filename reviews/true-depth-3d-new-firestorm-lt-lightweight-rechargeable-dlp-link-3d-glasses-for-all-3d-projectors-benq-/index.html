<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-great-value-and-amazing-service">A Great Value and Amazing Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, you can&rsquo;t go wrong. While we ended up using this seller&rsquo;s IR emitter with IR glasses, if you do have a television or projector that works with DLP link technology these are a very cost-effective accessory to your home theater system. They were one of the only brands that would actually sync up with my television, so I know the signal is strong. I personally prefer the seller&rsquo;s other style of these, which are heavier and seem more durable, but if you want a lightweight pair of 3D glasses for DLP link technology at an affordable price, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with these. They are affordable and the technology is obviously superior. The seller is amazing as well. I have never in my life experienced such devoted customer service and such a knowledgeable third-party seller on Amazon. I have written a few reviews about his products and service and honestly can&rsquo;t say enough good things about him and the items he sells. It is so rare nowadays to find quality products at great prices with great service. I would be confident in any product this seller recommended to me and I completely trust his knowledge and his products for all of my family&rsquo;s 3D home entertainment needs. That is saying a lot, considering the fact that I don&rsquo;t give praise lightly. 3dprostore is definitely worthy of any praise and I can recommend their products and services with complete peace of mind.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-recommend-these-3d-glasses-to-anybody">I would recommend these 3D glasses to anybody.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a 3D projector for about 3 years and at first the glasses I was getting were expensive and very heavy. It wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable wearing the heavy glasses thru an entire movie. A friend of mine recommended these glasses to me and I love them. They are easy to charge and very light weight. The charge lasts a long time - I haven&rsquo;t tested them throughout the full duration but I was able to watch a few movies before recharging them. They are absolutely great and they are also less expensive than those heavy glasses. I would recommend these glasses to anybody.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="will-not-charge-under-any-circumstances-good-for-one-viewing-only-complete-waste-of-money">Will not charge under any circumstances, good for one viewing only!!! Complete waste of money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These glasses arrived on time and in perfect shape. After turning one of the pair on and enabling the 3D DPL-Link feature on my projector they worked fine, once. After trying several chargers and cables it became clear that the glasses simply would not recharge. I tried the other pair, brand new, and it also would not charge even one time. While being charged the glasses with respond normally to the on/off switch, but the charger is where your nose is so you can&rsquo;t use them while charging. I&rsquo;ll never purchase from this manufacturer again.</p>

<h5 id="great-clear-3d-glasses-with-a-great-price">Great clear 3d glasses with a great price!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr Dan,truely enjoy your true depth 3d glasses.What is strikingly amazing is the 30 or so reviews rhat I readbefore buying true depth never mentioned how clear the true depth glasses are! The true depth glasses that you shippedme makes my old Expand glasses look like sunglasses.But lack of side blinders make me want to move up to your primium glasses. Some background, I recently was blessed to be cured of the ptsd that was incurred by being a police officer. Since than I am now using your true depth glasses to enjoy all of the 3d movies that I could not enjoy before! So I am now rebuying all of the action/drama movies that I couldn&rsquo;t watch before. So your true depth movies, I am actually using to watch 2d to 3d tv movies. Even the 2d to 3d movies look great and clear with the glasses displaying true depth in that mode.Coincidentially I just received the Captain America 3d dvd in the mail and can&rsquo;t wait to see the movie through your glasses I will rate the true depth glasses 5 stars with the caveat that I will use them as spare 3d glasses once I upgrade to the true depth premiums.</p>

<h5 id="you-wont-find-a-better-set-of-glasses-for-the-money-especially-with-the-level-of-support-you-get-from-true-depth">You wont find a better set of glasses for the money, especially with the level of support you get from True Depth!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all and most important is that these glasses are amazing and are a great value for the money.My projector - BenQ W1070Screen - DIY screen made from blackout cloth, was 60&rdquo;, now 100&rdquo;.I got these when I first purchased my current projector, since then I have moved my mount and increased the size of my screen. That is the only reason these glasses don&rsquo;t get 5 stars. Once I went to a larger screen, these lenses on these just seemed too small. I had to stay focused on the screen without much freedom to look around.The support from True Depth is great, any questions I had were answered very quickly.The packaging of the glasses is enough to protect them, but not an excessive amount that is more waste than practical.The protective bag they come with is nice, but it would be nicer to have a small hard case. As it is though, the bag is nice as it allows you to just throw them in the bag and put them wherever. You do not have to worry about them scratching a lot.The design, beyond the lenses, is great. Fully functional and light you barely know they are on.The batteries in these glasses are great, I have only had to charge them once.Syncing&hellip; I thought that due to the low cost of these glasses that the syncing would have a lot of issues, and I&rsquo;m glad I was wrong. I have never had issues with the sync on these glasses. You turn it on, they sync immediately and only loose sync if you look for awhile. But when you look back towards the screen, it syncs back within seconds.In the end, if you have a smallish screen, or do not enjoy the weight of the larger glasses these are perfect and you wont find a better set of glasses for the money. True Depth really did great!</p>

<h5 id="for-mitsubishi-dlp-tvs-the-trick-is">For Mitsubishi DLP TVs the trick is..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I might give it 5 stars later but since I have watched a 3D only for 15 mins, just 4 for now.I have WD65837. I was almost going to buy an emitter for this as I thought the glasses are either not compatible with the TV or needs an emitter. But I read something on review of another true depth glasses and thought I would try it out.. The trick is to turn off the 3D and back on. And tried that and the 3D started working pretty much flawlessly. I didnt feel the shuttering and the 3D feels pretty smooth. I didnt feel the same with the old Xpand glasses which I stopped using as I got headache after the movie.. i could feel the shuttering with those but not with these glasses.. I might return and update the review later once I watch couple movies with it. Charging the glasses seem easy as it has the same port that comes with an HTC phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">DO NOT BUY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased these and just used them for the first time this weekend for Kong Skull Island. They could not be focused. We tried the troubleshooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impossible-to-charge-waste-of-money">Impossible to charge ! Waste of money !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 pair, l used them 2 times and now I can t charge them. I didn&rsquo;t know theses glasses was for one viewing only !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wouldn-t-recommend">Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well i got them early which was nice but one of them the green light never came on but when plugged in the red light indicated its was charging and the other works when it wants.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-love-them-they-work-great">We love them! They work great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love them! They work great! We had purchased some before, from &ldquo;Another Vender&rdquo; that had built in batteries, that Could Not be replaced.</p>

<h5 id="good-pick-for-3d-projector">Good pick for 3d projector</h5>

<h5 id="don-t-recommend-i-m-using-them-on-an-optoma">Don&rsquo;t recommend. I&rsquo;m using them on an Optoma</h5>

<p>Eh. Not too impressed. Barely see the difference if any at all. Don&rsquo;t recommend. I&rsquo;m using them on an Optoma.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="problems-no">Problems? No.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No problems. They even arrived a day early it seems. Both glasses charged up successfully and tested perfectly as I watched &lsquo;Monsters, Inc.</p>
