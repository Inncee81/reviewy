<h5 id="i-reversed-my-rating-from-2-to-5-stars">I reversed my Rating from 2 to 5 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I revamped my computer room for better functionality for my family. I installed an 11 foot kitchen countertop onto one side of our library/computer room; see picture (a feat in and by itself). Using a countertop allowed me to create a wireless environment with 3 separate computer stations; 1 PC &amp; 2 Laptops (the LPs are hidden underneath the counter). I then mounted 3 computer monitors above the countertop. To keep costs down, I bought 3 of these inexpensive wall mounting computer monitors arms.For parties, we use the countertop to hold the food. These wall mounted monitor arms allow all 3 of the monitors to be pushed back snuggly against the wall, and out of the way of the food, and potential messes. I like a wire free environment, so all of my computers have wireless keyboards and mice (color coded on the bottom to not get mixed up). This allows them to be easily removed when the food comes onto the countertop. So everything is out of the way including the monitors.But during the week, and regular life, when the kids/family are using the computers for school work, or gaming, or for gathering information from the internet, these wall mounted monitor arms allow for easy adjustment to personal preference… No hassles.When I first mounted these monitors, I’ll admit I had some difficulty making adjustments when using the wrenches that came in the box. I even had some difficulty tilting the monitors up and down. Therefore at that time, I gave these wall mounting arms a rating of only 2 stars. However, I’ve now revered my rating to a 5 star. I&rsquo;ve owned these wall mounted arms for 9 months now, and I&rsquo;ve learned how to make the adjustments, quickly and easily. Also these mounting arms have held up very well; they have NOT sagged down from the Monitor weight. My older I-INC monitor is 24 inches, and the 2 newer Dell Monitors are 23.5 inches They are nice and sturdy and easily move into position as needed. The wall mounts allow the monitors to be spun 360 degrees, although I have only had to spin them 90 degrees one way or the other to watch a cell phone videos that were taken with the phone sideways.Also my kids like to play a racing game called TrackMania - Canyon, and often play it on the center monitor, with it fully extended out from the wall. This arm has had no problems doing so and doesn’t sag. Also sometimes, if there is too much light in the room, they throw a blanket over both themselves and the monitor to block the sun light. The blanket adds additional weight, and yet the support arms have not sagged. I’m very impressed.Other comments:Firstly, I’ve added a smaller rubber bumper to the mounting arm to keep it from marring the wall when fully collapsed against it. Just one side, as when moved to the other side it touches off on the wall opening housing.Secondly I bought the bigger bolts from a hardware store, that could still fit through the wall mounting holes on the bracket. I simply don’t trust bolts and screws from China, as I’ve had some others (not these) break. So an additional 50 cents for bigger bolts could possibly save your $300 monitor from falling.Thirdly, my kids wish the 2 side monitors could be swung over to towards the middle one, so that all 3 could be used for the racing gaming together, for multi-screen gaming. However, the spacing between them is such that when used separately, people aren’t too close and uncomfortable. So if these arm on this product had an additional 10 inch of reach, then they could serve as both (a) separate computer monitors with comfortable spacing, and (b) then be swung over and used for multi-screen gaming.</p>

<p>I bought this wall mount for a 28&rdquo; Vizio to mount above a treadmill. I am not a particularly handy guy, but this mount was very easy to install. Drill two pilot holes into a stud and drive in the provided screws. No problem at all. For the price this is a very attractive product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good solid mount. Easy to deal with and mount. A couple of cons that you need to be aware of: 1) there are no washers included as depicted in the instructions, so you&rsquo;ll need to buy some fender washers to go with them and 2) the screws they include to attach the TV to the mount are not long enough if you are using the extension arms with washers.</p>

<h5 id="will-work-but-proper-level-for-alignment-of-multiple-monitors-is-critical">Will work but proper level for alignment of multiple monitors is CRITICAL!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took the risk and bought these cheap monitor wall mounts. I got three of them for around $12 a pop! I knew there wouldn&rsquo;t be much room for error when it came to wall mounting three of these since I needed them all perfectly aligned and straight so my monitors would be of even height. I could have gone for one of the more expensive mounts that had more adjust ability should your monitors not match up on first installation. There is height adjust and maybe some sideways adjustment.These mounts had a little side adjustment but no height adjustment if I mounted these triple mounts one slightly lower or higher than the other. That would leave me with uneven monitors of noticeably height differences. I didn&rsquo;t want that at all. However careful planning of the height I wanted my monitors to be at and the use of a laser level (critical) enabled me to get an almost perfect top alignment of my three monitors. My left monitor is very slightly a teeny bit lower than my middle monitor but it is hardly noticeable and I can live with it. Since as I said it is hardly noticeable.Anyone looking at my monitors would hardly likely see the difference unless they were specifically looking or I pointed it out to them. In other words it isn&rsquo;t noticeable to the point where when you look at my monitors its the first thing you see. My reason for deducting one star was because while these monitors seemed well built they are easily scratched and the paint removed, so be careful with accidentally banging them against the wall or any other metal or solid structure it may ruin their paint job.Other than that I would recommend them if you were on a budget and looking to save some cash from the more expensive alternatives. Just remember if you are installing mounts for more than one monitor which you would like to have in perfect alignment with each other a laser level or some form of level to get you a straight an accurate line for mount placement is critical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hinge between the double-arm and the wall mount was very, very hard to move. I needed to move it in order to install it (I installed in a corner with a wall to the right, so I needed the arm to either be straight out or to the left). In order to do so I had to use a two screw drivers through the screw holes in the base plate to provide leverage, in doing so bending the base plate. I was able to hammer it back but not having to go through this effort would have been nice. I&rsquo;m otherwise very happy with this mount.</p>

<h5 id="the-tilt-is-difficult-at-times-but-the-product-is-great-for-the-price-easy-to-install">The tilt is difficult at times, but the product is great for the price! Easy to install!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this wall mount to display a security monitor for my small business.For the price of the mount, I thought it was a GREAT buy. Upon receiving the product, the instructions were easy to follow as long as you have the appropriate tools. In total, the mount took about 15 minutes to install.The reason for the 4 star rating is that the maneuverability of the mount can be difficult at times. I installed the mount at eye level, and have trouble with the glare from my overhead lighting. In hindsight, I should have thought about that prior to installing, however I figured with the tilt of the mount it should be fine. All things considered, it meets my needs and helps me keep my business secure!</p>

<h5 id="great-mount-for-the-price">Great mount for the price!</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple mount. Comes with all the hardware needed. You need to supply the drill, <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> drill bit for pre-drilling the holes for the mounting bolts, and a level.</p>
