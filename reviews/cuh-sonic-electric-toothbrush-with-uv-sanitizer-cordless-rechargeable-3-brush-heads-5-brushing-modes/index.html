<h5 id="really-a-good-electric-toothbrush">Really a Good Electric Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This electric toothbrush is impressive. Love having a compartment to place the brush heads in &amp; an added plus that when closed the brushes are sanitized. Love the feature of the timer for each section of your mouth. The best is my mouth feels so clean after using it..I had another name brand electric toothbrush &amp; had paid much more&hellip;but this CUH Sonic really really cleans.I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-toothbrush">Great Toothbrush!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently bought this Sonic Toothbrush with the UV Light toothbrush head sterilizer and I am very happy with my purchase. My teeth and gum lines are cleaner and mor plaque free than they have been in a very long time. I love that I can remove the Toothbrush head after each use and sterilize it for the next use. Another convenient featur is that you cannot overcharge the Toothbrush. The base will charge it until it is fully charged, then turn off. One charge lasts up to six weeks! The three speeds are all really great. All of these things are terrific and I would have given five stars but the site says they may not continue to sell the replacement brush heads, which is a real pain. I looked all over for the replacement brush heads or ones that will work with this system&hellip;I think I found compatible ones but I&rsquo;m not completely sure until I buy and try them out on the Toothbrush. This is a big inconvenience and cost my review a star. If they decide to continue to sell the replacement brush heads, I will amend my review to reflect this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">Works like a charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I enjoy the multiple settings and quick charging on this toothbrush, I was wary of buying an off brand product but this works like expected and gives my mouth that deep clean feeling I&rsquo;ve been missing with manual brushing. I dont know if the UV light <em>actually</em> works but it&rsquo;s a nice thought. Charge lasts for about 2 weeks and the extra heads are a money saver.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="your-gums-look-great">&ldquo;Your gums look great!&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the hygienist said at my latest cleaning after purchasing this toothbrush and isn&rsquo;t that why you buy an electric toothbrush? This is a user friendly unit that is efficient and effective. I love the ultra sonic brush cleaner and the five different settings. I highly recommend this toothbrush .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="far-superior-to-anything-i-ve-had-before">far superior to anything I&rsquo;ve had before</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had other so-called ultrasonic toothbrushes that were quite expensive and didn&rsquo;t last very long. When my last one gave out I went shopping and found the CUH for a heck of a lot less money, and amazingly, far superior to anything I&rsquo;ve had before. The UV sanitizer in an enclosed compartment was a pleasant suprize and a big plus. IMHO you won&rsquo;t go wrong with this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product-well-made-and-lots-of-options-to-use">Nice product &hellip; Well made and lots of options to use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The system seems to be doing its job &hellip; I have never used this product though I have used some from a much more expensive product &hellip; I purchased this product because it was easier on my pocket &hellip; I like how it gives me several options for all my teeth and gum treatment &hellip; I have only had it for about two to three weeks but if I have any problems with the product in the future I will post it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-price-this-works-great-i-like-it-so-far">For the price this works great. I like it so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price this works great. I like it so far. The charging indicator is nice and it lasts a very long time. I didn&rsquo;t really notice additional brushes under the CUH brand. I did order &ldquo;Xtech Replacement Brush Heads for XHST-100 Ultrasonic Toothbrush&rdquo; and they seem to fit fine. The units look almost the same just branded differently so I took a chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="toothbrush">Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall very satisfied with the purchase. Product is very sturdy and the multiple brushing options each work well. I like the multiple heads included and the UV light to clean the heads. The 30 second timer is also subtle and works well. Those were key to our purchase, Only negatives and these are minor are the heads are a little tough to get on and off the base unit. Secondly the cord is stiff. We leave this in th middle of a double sink as my wife and I use it. The cord being stiff doesn&rsquo;t easily lay flat. Again not a big deal, but if it layed flat I would give 5 stars. I would purchase another one and would recommend to someone else looking for an electric tooth brush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-one">Good One</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not worrying about buying batteries again for my tooth brush. This is more than I expected due to the number of items that comes with the tooth brush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE IT!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of-money">Waste of money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item in September 2016 and the battery no longer holds a charge. What a waste.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-does-the-job-nicely-it-s-wobbly-in-it-s-stand">it does the job nicely, it&rsquo;s wobbly in it&rsquo;s stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>lots of different settings, it does the job nicely, it&rsquo;s wobbly in it&rsquo;s stand, that can be improved.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="was-great-until-it-broke">Was great until it broke</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke in lesss than 5 months. One of the two i bought still works but the other just feels like the motor quit and I only had 30 days to return</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-highly-recommend">Great value, highly recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent!! For the price, it feels more quality and effectively built, solid construction.. much more than I expected. Great value. Highly recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-like-it">Did not like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>weak tooth brush. Did not like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product">nice product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well nice that it has different modes or speeds. Like the UV, but the brush doesn&rsquo;t fit all the way down on the handle so stuff can get up underneath it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-what-i-thought-it-would-like">not what i thought it would like</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it just buzzes hurt my teeth &hellip;..did not like china made thing they hate us any way three more words</p>
