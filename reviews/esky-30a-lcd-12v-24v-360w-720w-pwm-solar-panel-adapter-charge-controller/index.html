<h5 id="good-value">Good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The manual leaves a lot to be desired. However, after playing with it hooked to a solar cell and battery and going thru all the menu options and using the manual as a reference, one can figure out how it works.As for the charge controller, it is working just fine. It will automatically start charging a discharged battery in the &ldquo;bulk&rsquo; mode, and progress thu several charge modes till it gets to the &lsquo;float&rsquo; mode where it maintains the battery. It will switch a load such as a 12 volt light, on and off as the solar cells turn on and off with sunlight, but has a &lsquo;charge only mode&rsquo; for just charging batteries.You get a lot of controller for the price paid. I have been running it on120 watts of solar panel, charging two deep cycle batteries and it is working well so far. We will see how long it last.</p>

<h5 id="good-deal-for-simple-12-or-24-volt-systems">Good deal for simple 12 or 24 volt systems.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received an evaluation unit in exchange for this review which I believe to be unbiased.Pros: A well built unit. Lots of features. Good power rating in a small package. Easy to heat sink for high power. A good 30 amp controller for $30. USB outlets are a nice touch.Cons: The English manual is poorly written and ambiguous in many areas. This makes it difficult to figure out several of the figures. It does not have a solar panel power optimization circuit.I tested this unit in my lab (pictured) using a simple 12 volt panel with intense halogen lights, a small battery and a small 12 volt load. This helped me understand some of the features that are poorly documented. I took off one star for the documentation. The dedicated LCD shows the status and lets you click through many different modes. The voltages and currents displayed were accurate. You can see the build quality in the board pictures, which was quite good. I especially liked the hand soldered bus bar on the back (third picture, top) to handle the large rated currents.Advanced units have circuits which modify the panel voltage and current (step up or down) to optimize power collection even on cloudy days. This unit does not have that, but that is NOT expected for a $30 unit, so no points off. This unit simply connects and disconnects the solar panel to the battery depending on the battery voltage. They do have a switching regulator to drive the USB chargers, which is also a nice touch.Esky: Please get a good English manual written, this would make it a 5+ star unit.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-quality-product">Easy to use, quality product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My family has been struggling to understand and use off-grid solar as a backup for power outages. Thankfully, this product was easy to understand and use. It is helpful to watch a youtube video prior to hooking it up because as mentioned in previous reviews, the accompanying manual is minimal and leaves important details out that seem critical and are mentioned in other reviews such as hooking up the battery before including the solar and inverter wires into this controller. In my search for information I came across that inserting the wires into the controller in some orders would lead to a short in the controller&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, I did the recommended battery first, inverter then solar panel. We have had no problems- but I&rsquo;m not sure that I would have realized this from reading the instructions alone. I will use for a while to monitor but my expectation is that I won&rsquo;t need to worry about overcharging the battery so that I can keep my array continuously hooked up and ready. I was also please at how easily I will be able to monitor power usage, input, etc. I would also like to say that the casing seems strong, of quality make/materials and a nice weight.</p>

<h5 id="note-this-is-a-positive-common-device">NOTE: THIS IS A POSITIVE COMMON DEVICE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this item on April 25, 2017, received it on the 29th. It was intended to be used in a power supply circuit for radios that operate on a battery bank <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. Upon careful examination of the electrical properties of the device, I discovered that it is a &ldquo;Positive Common&rdquo; controller. This means that it performs all control switching by manipulating the negative connections. Since most electronic equipment (especially radios) needs to be protected from ESD; Lightning, etc. by grounding, it means sharing a common ground. Since almost all such equipment uses ground for its negative power source, (common) the negative side cannot be removed from ground without rendering the device unsafe.In order to use this controller, everything would have to be isolated from ground. This is not only impractical, in the case of my system it&rsquo;s useless. All the negatives would be attached to ground, all the positives would be constantly connected to both the battery bank and the charger panels, hence nothing would ever be switched.Since the internal electronics of the controller are powered by the battery, it cannot be isolated from the load, and therefore is in danger of damage by an unwanted ground loop. I suspect that is the reason for the mysterious failures sighted in other reviews.Although the controller probably works fine in an isolated system, I cannot recommend it because almost all recharge systems CANNOT BE SAFELY ISOLATED FROM GROUND.NOTE: THIS IS A POSITIVE COMMON DEVICE!</p>

<h5 id="good-little-unit-works-well">Good little unit, works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Now works fine and is a pretty impressive unit. I have had the unit in light service for a week or two and the unit really works well. Once you get the control sequence down it is fairly easy to adjust and operate. The only thing that it falls short on is the instruction in that instruction could be a little clearer on function of load control. All and all I would buy it again or recommend it to a friend. After having to leave a message for &ldquo;support&rdquo; they did get back to me and were eager to help me exchange the unit, however, the problem I had was all my fault so I did not return the unit. Works good and I am satisfied with the unit and purchase.</p>

<h5 id="it-works-great-and-is-easy-to-hook-up">it works great and is easy to hook up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This system works perfectly as intended. My only issue with it, is the area where you put in your wires doesn&rsquo;t support any wire larger then 6AWG and I wanted to run 2AWG due to the distance. I didn&rsquo;t research that as a possibility when I looked at buying this so I can&rsquo;t even say if there are other that have larger areas for wire.All of that being said, it works great and is easy to hook up. It only took me a few minutes to get it all installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-this-faulty-product">Don&rsquo;t Buy this faulty product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not fully working. The usb outlets do not charge&hellip;I wish I knew this earlier and I would have returned it. So I am unhappy with it!</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>easy to set up and it works good</p>

<h5 id="scared-to-death">Scared to death!</h5>

<p>As retired electronic tech i am giving this honest review.Purchased Nov. 1, 2016.Received item in in good ship time.Mounted and terminated using THHN 10awg wire.</p>

<p>Great worked right out if the box</p>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This controller was purchased as a backup / spare for an existing 30 amp 12 volt solar controller. Sad to say, this unit will not accept an 8 gauge wire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just installed unit. Working great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="working-well">Working well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works well easy to install the display is ok</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great! Just plug and play. I&rsquo;m using it in my 27&rsquo; travel trailer with 3 x 100W solar panels and 2 6V batteries. Very cool I can see the Volts and Amps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best price for a solar controller and built well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="why-have-settings-and-bells-and-whistles-and-no-decent-documentation">Why have settings and bells and whistles and no decent documentation?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The box worked upon connection, apparently. I use that last word because, like others, I am having a tough time deciphering the book.</p>
