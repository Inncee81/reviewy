<h5 id="is-ok-but-would-not-run-my-120-watt-laptop-power-supply">Is Ok but would not run my 120 watt laptop power supply</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price it is fine and will jump start a car and the light might come in handy the USB ports are handy the DC ports work fine and the air compressor works is not loud but is slow. The 120V outlets might work for non sensitive things but it did not work on my laptop&hellip;which has a 120 watt power supply and within the 200 watts this outputs. Seems after I read the instruction more carefully this does not output a pure sine wave for the 120V AC outlets and I imagine my laptop did not like that. I wound up having to buy a separate DC to AC converter for $26 to use with this in the DC port. I got the Bestek 300 Watt Power Inverter plugged it in to the DC power port then plugged my laptop in to the Bestek and it now powers my laptop as well as charging it at a fast rate. I used velcro to attach the Bestek to the left side of this product.Why Shcumacher couldn&rsquo;t have used better components for their power supply I don&rsquo;t know. Bestek did it complete for only $26.I tested it thoroughly today and it charged two completely drained 6 cell batteries using the Bestek and still had 50% battery left</p>

<h5 id="does-the-job-plus-a-whole-lot-more">Does the job, plus a whole lot more.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own 3 of these units and use them in the most difficult of situations. We own an RV and go camping regularly. Many of the campgrounds do not offer electricity and we must turn our generator off at 9 pm. We use 1 unit to power our 2 computers after quiet hours and it works great. We also have needed to jump start our camper when we accidentally left the cab light on and after a 3 minute charge it kick right over. We have also used the unit to give a booster charge to the RV house batteries to get the generator going.Additionally the unit has literally been a life saver. My husband must sleep with a positive airway machine that needs to be plugged in to AC while he sleeps. We have 1 unit that we have dedicated to that purpose and it provides sufficient power to run his machine all night without a problem! As long as you keep the AC requirements under the manufactures specs (400 watt surge, 200 watt continuous) you will have no problems. If you try to run a toaster or a coffee maker though, these things run 700+ watts, and the unit automatically shuts down.For the down side, yes the unit is heavy. It is in essence a car battery with an handle, plus a power inverter, with an air compressor and work light thrown in for good measure. But we knew it was heavy when we bought them so that doesn&rsquo;t bother us, and the upside far outweighs the weight issue.All in all, it is an excellent unit that does all that it was advertised to do.</p>

<h5 id="you-won-t-need-it-until-you-do">You won&rsquo;t need it until you do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, it is heavier than a boatload of bowling balls but this bad boy is worth it! Multiple outlets let me charge anything and everything. I swear you can jump-start a Caterpillar with it. The tire inflator works like a champ for both my compact car&rsquo;s low profile tires and the bigger ones on my wife&rsquo;s Land Rover. It was worth every cent!</p>

<h5 id="you-will-be-wasting-your-money-and-then-spending-more-to-fix-their-crappy-equipment">You will be wasting your money- and then spending more to fix their crappy equipment!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just bought this in the spring time. Equipment that didn&rsquo;t work when I needed the most to jump start my car. Called the company and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send back, which they do not reimburse! DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!! You will be wasting your money- and then spending more to fix their crappy equipment!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stopped-working-in-first-use">Stopped working in first use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this for the first time today to top off the air pressure in my daughters tires. Worked great on the first three tires however on the last the pump motor noise changed and it no longer pumped any air! This was the main reason I purchased this unit! Also please be aware if you can ship the product back it is very costly because of the internal battery. In my case the I could not return the item and had to dispose of it at a location that would take hazardous materials. Amazon however was great and did refund the purchase!</p>

<h5 id="this-charger-has-been-a-life-saver">This charger has been a &ldquo;life-saver&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This charger has been a &ldquo;life-saver&rdquo; on several occasions. One of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve made for emergency or back-up situations and for camping trips. Had a battery in our car die during our cold winter and this easily got the car started right up and it was super easy to connect without having to jockey another car along-side in the snow. - Used the pump to blow up an air mattress while camping, and to charge phones and other devices. I would definitely buy this again and recommend to others.</p>

<h5 id="jumped-my-garage-queen-with-zero-issues">Jumped my garage queen with Zero issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid piece of equipment. Amazon&rsquo;s price matched the local big box retailer, and it was a no brainer to order online. Particularly after 2 of the chain&rsquo;s local stores showed stock on their corpo site, but the employees were brain dead and/or the only one of this SKU around was a floor model that looked like it had been thru a tractor pool event at the county fair.Bought to have on hand for future situations, such as my garaged car with dead battery. Started the vehicle immediately, with 12.9 showing on the voltage readout. Excellent start to long-term ownership, no pun intended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-after-less-than-a-year-warranty-requires-buyer-to-pay-for-repair-shipping">Dead after less than a year. Warranty requires buyer to pay for repair shipping.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this in June of last year. I used it three times, and really liked it. Once was to pump up a bicycle tire. The other was to jump start my car. The other was to run by CPAP while camping. It performed well. For several months, I didn&rsquo;t have use for it. It was always on the charger, per the instructions. Now it&rsquo;s dead. I called about warranty service, but that required ME to pay to ship the (very heavy) item back. I&rsquo;m not spending upwards of $50 more to ship the item when it&rsquo;s likely to die again.</p>

<p>Not impressive but works. Wish it came with a cord to plug. Takes a LONG time to charge. Gets me about 6 hours to run my CPAP machine when camping. I use the Airsense 10 CPAP.</p>
