<h5 id="great-for-cloth-diapers">Great for cloth diapers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is awesome and such a great space saver. I use it to hang up my daughters cloth diapers and it have saved me so much room. When we do a load of wash it can be around 20 or so diapers and then in the drying process we would lay them all over the house to dry. This slowly became a pain and I was desperate for an alternative. It was always an interesting conversation if someone happened to do a pop in on laundry day. After doing some research I came across this option. Since its made of plastic I wasn&rsquo;t too sure on its durability but decided to give it a shot.The clip was awesome and I was able to hang it on my door frame right next to the laundry room and load it with diapers straight from the washer, this not only saved me time it was so convenient to be able to do it right out of the washer and not drip water around if the diapers were still a bit on the wet side. I am able to use every hook for a diaper and I would hang it from the middle of the diaper like the picture below shows that way I would not put any strain on the elastics.Being in the Arizona heat I could transport these to my shaded patio so that they could dry even quicker without taking the risk of line drying in direct sunlight and heat, and bring them right back in, I would unclip them very quickly due to the quick release and we were all set.This is a must if you cloth diaper and don&rsquo;t have the option to line dry due to excessive sunlight or heat or maybe you live in an area that its cold often. I bought two, one for the inserts and one for the pockets. Don&rsquo;t be wary of the price it&rsquo;s very strong and durable and works great!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-product-for-tight-spaces">Wonderful product for tight spaces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned two of these for years and absolutely love them. I originally bought them to help dry delicates, but after a while realized that they can easily hold pairs of jeans if you use more than two hooks. When I lived in a cramped apartment I was able to fit two of these from the shower curtain rod and dry almost all of my laundry at the same time. I do realize that I do smaller loads than a lot of people, so I would say that for me all the laundry was about 1 medium load spread across 2 of these, with some creative Tetris work involved. The things that would not fit were mostly things that I needed to flat dry anyway, so I never thought that I needed to get a third.I originally purchased these in 2005, it is now 2012 and both of them are going strong. For apartments where the only thing you have to dry on is the shower curtain rod, these cannot be beat. For everyone else, these are great for outdoor hanging, hanging in the closet, hanging from a curtain rod&hellip; basically just hanging clothing in spaces and areas that you might never have considered hanging laundry from before.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-it-but-why-won-t-amazon-allow-me-to-order-more-than-one">I love it but why won&rsquo;t Amazon allow me to order more than one?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it but why won&rsquo;t Amazon allow me to order more than one? That&rsquo;s right. I ordered one and then decided I could use a second one. A few days later, my mother wanted one (she doesn&rsquo;t use a computer) so I tried to order a third. Unfortunately, Amazon said I maxed out out how many I could order of this item. Luckily, Walmart had it for about the same price and free ship to store.With all that out of the way, this thing is great. The hook is easily opened and attached to where you need it. I hang mine from a gas pipe just above my washer/dryer. If I need to move it somewhere else. It&rsquo;s simply to grab it at the hook, apply pressure to open it up, move it where needed and let go. The entire rack rotates 360 degrees at the bottom of the hook so no moving it one way only to find it won&rsquo;t turn as far as you need and then have to turn it the other way. It spins independently from the hook. The clips you hang your clothing from are strong and there are plenty to chose from. Lastly, if need to store away, the hook, chains and clips can be bunched along the blue plastic rectangular frame the clips. So you&rsquo;ve basically got the size of the blue frame to deal with. It can easily be stashed in a tight gap between a wall and cabinet for example.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-drying-delicates">Perfect for drying delicates!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nifty gadget that&rsquo;s great for drying delicates that can&rsquo;t go through the dryer! I always used to have to pull out all the drawers in my chest of drawers and hang my delicates on the sides of the drawers and over the backs of chairs. Now, thanks to this great (and inexpensive!) device, I can easily clip them all up for easy and fast drying. I would say that is a perfect use case for this device. I think you could get away with things that are a bit heavier, but just be aware that the clips are all very close together so you won&rsquo;t be able to use them all without your clothes being pressed up against each other with any normal clothes (shorts, tshirts, etc.). Since I have drying needs for all types of garments (usually need somewhere to hang sweaty athletic clothes), I paired this with Household Essentials 5012-1 Portable 2-Tier Clothes Drying Rack Tri-pod - Dry Wet Laundry or Hang Clothes - Silver and Blue and am very happy with the result. Great hang-to-dry space for all my clothing needs!</p>

<h5 id="very-handy-device-for-those-who-prefer-to-air-dry-clothes">Very handy device for those who prefer to air dry clothes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a clothes dryer or don&rsquo;t like using it, a clip drying rack is indispensable. I&rsquo;m such a person; I prefer to air dry clothes. I&rsquo;ve tried several kinds of racks of the years, and this is the best. The capacity is usually sufficient for all the socks and underwear, etc in a load of wash, however I bought a second one for those overflow loads.The clips have a good, springy action and are easily gripped&ndash;easier than clothespins. The spring-loaded hook at the top allows you to hang the rack on most anything. (I move mine around to take advantage of the breeze.) It&rsquo;s also handy for projects such a repairing objects with glue. I make the repair, then clamp it into the rack.I&rsquo;ve had mine for over a year. I keep it outside most of the time, but not exposed to direct sunlight. It seems very durable thus far. I live in a humid climate and some plastics simply degrade after a year of so. This Whitmor laundry hanger is made of plastic (and metal springs) that is holding up very well.</p>
