<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="nice-and-inexpensive">Nice and inexpensive.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as expected. Two things I could add. Wish it was a bit smaller and wish it had a switch to swap which card it reads when two are in.Also the little plastic flip cover needed to be taken off, heated and made to fit more snug on the reader, otherwise, it works very nicely. Will update if any problems arise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works great for an SD or Micro SD card. I use it in my 2014 Ford F150, in the USB 2 port (that I found by looking online and adding a mini USB male to normal USB female 3ft. cable from the Sync interface in dash to the glove box).&mdash;[&hellip;]You can&rsquo;t have a micro sd and sd card in the reader at the same time. Only one will work (can&rsquo;t remember which). So have one card in at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-nice-design-excellent-data-reading-speed">Well made, nice design, excellent data reading speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made memory card reader that is easy to use. I find using a reader easier that sticking a memory card into the little reader slot in a computer. This one is inexpensive but well made. Has a slot for both Micro and redular SD cards. It is easy to load and excellent data reading speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-sd-card-reader-that-also-safely-stores-your-card">An SD Card Reader that also safely stores your card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This card reader does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do - you insert an SD or microSD card and plug it in and you can read/write to the card. Like others have mentioned, it will only read one card even if you put cards in both slots, so you can&rsquo;t use it to copy from one card to the other using just this device. I really like that the cover for the card(s) is such a positive lock - this really protects your card so you can&rsquo;t accidentally open it. I like the access light so I can tell the computer is reading it.It is a bit bulkier than others, but that is because it has a cover for the SD card to protect the card in it. That&rsquo;s fine for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-i-like-using-these-instead-of-flash-drives">Works great. I like using these instead of flash drives</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. I like using these instead of flash drives, as I can update my SD cards as they larger versions get cheaper. With this, and a micro/mini SD card adapter, I can read cards from my cell phone, cameras, video recorders, etc. I like the integrated/swinging end cap. The last set I had did not have these integrated, so of course I lost most of the end caps. Very pleased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-price-was-great-and-the-performance-was-good-so-with-that-i">The price was great and the performance was good so with that I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have not used it much but so far it is the answer to our needs , loads and down loads sd cards very fast and helps with the problem with the Air Mac 11 that does not have a sd card reader built in. Our Air Mac 13 has a build in card reader . This is the answer for all the people out there that are using an Air Mac 11. The price was great and the performance was good so with that I would recommend it to others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-great-price">Good product - Great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With the advent of the new, reduced size laptop computer, the SD Card reader slot was removed. This restores the capability to use a camera and download multiple pictures quickly, as well as use a card for data storage and transfer. This unit is a vast improvement over one that I have had for years, and feels more robust in construction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-device-especially-for-the-money">Great device, especially for the money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For an inexpensive device this does everything you could expect. It&rsquo;s nice to have one device for both type sd cards and be able to store them as well. It is light weight but sturdy enough. It immediately connected with my laptop and did everything advertised. I was impressed with the protective packaging as it shows that the seller wanted everything about their product to be a class above.</p>
