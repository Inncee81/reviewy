<h5 id="this-is-the-folding-full-sized-keyboard-i-ve-been-looking-for-this-is-model-bk-05-the-larger-of-two-trifold-keyboard-models">This is the folding full-sized keyboard I&rsquo;ve been looking for. (This is Model BK-05, the larger of two trifold keyboard models.)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I always have my iPad with me, but it&rsquo;s a pain to have to also have to pack an Apple keyboard for when I want to take meeting notes or work on documents away from home. This keyboard is lightweight, folds to a small size, and it is a full-sized keyboard with a useful row of function keys and a great feel for a touch typist. There is the option to backlight it at two light levels, three colors, for low-light situations. There is even a sweet drawstring travel pouch. This thing is small enough that there is no hesitation to throwing it into my bag even if I am not sure I will need it. I love my Apple Bluetooth keyboard, but this is the one I reach for now if I am heading out. My iPad has a case that can serve as a landscape-oriented easel, so all I have to do is set it up, unfold the keyboard (that turns it on, no buttons necessary), and start typing. There is no hesitation or Bluetooth pairing glitching or delays at all. Also, very important for a rapid touch typist, the feel of typing on this keyboard is great. I can go at great speed with no errors or sticking. The top function keys include handy ones like copy, cut, paste, select all, search, and others, a bonus. The keyboard can be used wirelessly or connected through a standard USB cable, and I have had no issues with having the charge run out while I am out using the keyboard wirelessly. If I ever do, I&rsquo;ll just plug an external battery into the USB port.Highly recommended.UPDATE FOR CLARITY: It is now late April and the keyboard &ndash; actually 2 of them because I got one for my husband too &ndash; has continued to be great. I am adding this update because there is some confusion as to which model is being praised here. There are actually TWO trifolding keyboard models offered by the manufacturer, and their Amazon descriptions are sometimes easy to confuse. I have tried them both, and I want readers to know that it is the LARGER trifold keyboardl, BK-05, that I am recommending. The smaller model, BK-03, is inferior in many ways: less stable, detectable lag, much harder to type many characters (it has fewer rows of keys), and not backlit. The somewhat larger size and higher price are worth it: I recommend going for the larger model, the backlit one, BK-05. (Though for some reason I have not seen that model number in the description, only on the manual that came with the keyboard.). I will attach comparison photos of the two models. I am recommending the one on top, the BK-05.</p>

<h5 id="hisgadget-tricolor-keyboard-review-very-positive">Hisgadget tricolor keyboard review, very positive!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a solid product. I got mine in july of 2016 and I have been very pleased. It is extremely flexible. I have used it with my IPad, my Win7 machine and my Ubuntu machine.The keyboard is extremely compact and portable when folded up. Unfolded it is very comfortable to use with good tactile feedback. I use it for note taking and capturing thoughts on my commute. It makes my IPad a much more useful tool in that respect.In early October my first keyboard suffered a stroke. The keys on the right side of the keyboard fold stopped working. Seemed like a loose cable on that side since I could close the right side about halfway and the keys started working again. I could not find a way to open the keyboard and reseat the cable.I sent a note to Hisgadget asking if there was a way to open the keyboard so I could reseat the cable. They were great! They said &lsquo;don&rsquo;t try to open the keyboard, just send it back to us and we will send you a new one&rsquo;. They sent me a return label, I packed the keyboard up and sent it back and I had a new keyboard in a week. We traded several e-mails, they were always very courteous and concerned about my experience.This is my first five star review. First because the product does exactly what I needed it to do, second because the approach Hisgadget takes to customer service is outstanding.I am very pleased with this product and vendor.</p>

<h5 id="have-any-doubts-throw-them-away-this-is-a-winner-top-to-bottom">Have any doubts? Throw them away, This is a winner top to bottom!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>5 Stars all around! This keyboard is perfect for an on the go person like myself. I have a tablet that I use when I am out on the road and this does wonders. I thought the hinges would dig into my wrists, you don&rsquo;t even feel them. Not to mention the awesome LED lighting under the keys (I am a sucker for green lights on a keyboard). The typing itself is a very satisfying experience. The travel distance on the keys is great and feel like a full size laptop, there are little stand you can flip out on the sides to raise it up so you are not typing flat. They really have covered all their bases here. They also include a manual to show you all the little shortcuts you can do along the way and which ones work with what operating system. Like I said, 5 stars all around. I will definitely be buying from them again.</p>

<h5 id="great-portable-keyboard">Great portable keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a college student and constantly on the move. I use tablet and smart phone to do majority of classwork. This keyboard has unique features that are perfect for me.1. Portability: When folded, it takes space barely larger then my Samsung Note 4. I can just toss it in the backpack until needed. Plus it hold charge very long time (easily two-three months).2. Duo connection: It can be connected via Bluetooth or USB like any wired keyboard. So I can quickly use it to type a quick e-mail on my phone/tablet or connect to any computer when needed.3. Full keyboard: There is no compromise in size or function keys. There was almost no learning curve using this thing. As other reviewers mentioned, this is probably the best portable keyboard I&rsquo;ve used.4. Backlit: Although gimmicky, changeable back-lit colors up the &ldquo;cool&rdquo; factors for this keyboard.If I have to nitpick, the only two improvement I would want are built in phone/tablet holder and way to keep the keyboard locked when folded.Overall, I highly recommend it.</p>
