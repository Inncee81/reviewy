<ul>
<li>One pair ( 1 piece black + 1 piece red ) of UL Listed solar cable. Both solar cables are terminated with MC4 Connectors.</li>
<li>SEE IMAGE #2 in the photo gallery for 10 AWG and 12 AWG solar cable specifications</li>
<li>Photovoltaic module interconnection cable for use with or without a raceway in accordance with the Wiring Systems, Article 690 in the National Electric Code (NEC), NFPA 70.</li>
<li>UL Listed solar cable is designed for outdoor use and is moisture, UV and corrosion resistant. Solar cable is manufactured in the USA.</li>
<li>Solar extension cable is typically sold in 16, 14, 12 and 10 AWG sizes. The solar cable offered in this listing is 12 AWG and 10 AWG which are the two largest sizes of the four. Using large diameter cable minimizes power loss in your solar panel system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Size:10 AWG Solar Cable  |  Color:10 Feet Black + 10 Feet Red
This includes one pair (1 piece black cable + 1 piece red cable) of UL Listed 10 AWG or 12 AWG Solar Extension Cable with MC4 Connectors. Simply choose the desired cable size (10 AWG or 12 AWG) and cable length (feet) from the selections. Made in the USA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I received these, I thought there was no way they were actually 10 AWG, because they look thinner than that. But, the wiring itself is absolutely 10 AWG, it just has a thinner, stiffer insulation than I am used to seeing on solar cables. Usually, solar cables have a soft, pliable rubber insulation that is quite thick. The insulation on these is a harder material, not nearly as pliable or flexible, more similar to what you see on thinner gauge solid core wires.I could see the flexibility of these cables being an issue for people who need to make a lot of tight bends in their installation. For me, it was not an issue, and in fact I appreciated the wires not being as floppy as the standard solar wire. It was easier to get nice and straight, and being slightly thinner was also kind of handy. I guess your mileage would vary depending upon your usage.The MC4 connectors on my wires were all nice and solid, the correct type, and fit snugly into my Renogy Y connectors. I have little doubt that they are as waterproof as the Renogy brand. Mine will not be directly in the elements, since I have them positioned under the panels and elevated slightly. But if you are worried about waterproofing, just dab some silicone sealant around the seams of the connector, or make a small junction box. This would be the case for any MC4 connector on the market.I experience very little loss with these cables, and frankly that is the only thing that is truly important about cables.</p>

<h5 id="one-of-the-two-cables-i-received-had-male-connectors-on-both-ends">One of the two cables I received had male connectors on both ends</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The build quality seems good, but on the pair I ordered and received the black cable, and only that one, had male connectors on both ends, which makes it hilariously useless and I have to return it. I have no idea how that made it through quality control.</p>

<h5 id="a-perfect-pair-for-aftermarket-rv-solar">A Perfect Pair for aftermarket RV Solar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These worked great. A big THANK YOU to whichever agency made these solar connectors a cross industry standard. These plugged directly into the watertight connectors on the solar panel I was mounting on the roof of my 5th wheel travel trailer and I could easily wire it right into to my charge controller. Very high quality wiring cover, good watertight connectors, and a great price on Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality-control">Poor quality control</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry but I didn&rsquo;t have a good experience with these cables. When I connected my solar panel to the charge controller there was no power coming through the cable. After hours of diagnostics with Renogy, my controller company, (checking volts, switching polarity, etc.) and consultation with my panel retailer, we finely concluded the problem had to be in the cable or the connectors. I got my hands on new connectors and was going to install them but when I started to cut the old ones off I found the screw cap at the end wasn&rsquo;t secured tightly, (this is supposed to be tight to make it weatherproof) and when I screwed it off I found the cable slipped out along with the metal male connector. Once this is snapped into place it should never come out. I pushed it back in till I heard the click, screwed the cap back on and everything worked fine, but it cost me numerous wasted hours trying to diagnose the problem simply because someone in quality control didn&rsquo;t check to make sure the connector was assembled correctly. Other than that the cables work fine, but three stars is the best I&rsquo;ll give for all the hassle I went through.</p>

<h5 id="great-hd-mc4-cable">Great HD MC4 Cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good product. They are strand wires wound VERY tight with thick covering so they are not as flexible as you would think for a strand wire product. Very well made and heavy duty. The mc4 connections fit snug and water proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-some-have-noted">Like some have noted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like some have noted, the wires are a little stiff but that was OK with me and caused me no discomfort. I bought Renogy connectors for the mating wires and the fit was a little tight between the WindyNation and Renogy but I managed to connect/disconnect them OK. I bought the Renogy MC-4 tool to aid in disconnect.</p>

<h5 id="really-beefy-and-high-quality-wire-the-15-foot">Really beefy and high quality wire. The 15 foot &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really beefy and high quality wire. The 15 foot length I ordered left me with about 2 foot extra. I cut them shorter and got an extra pair of MC4 connectors out of the deal. The wire connectors going into my charge controller were screw down connectors and so one end did not need MC4 connectors</p>
