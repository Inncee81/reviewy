<h5 id="light-and-swift-quad-with-5-8ghz-fpv">Light and Swift quad with 5.8ghz FPV!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This little quad will surprise you just how quick and nimble it is in the air. The 5.8ghz screen transmits a beautifully clear picture indoors and outdoors the sun will cause some glare on the screen but nothing too serious.==========Pros==========*Comes with two batteries for the quad and the controller!*5.8ghz transmits nicely to the screen*Flies very well*Battery last quite a while*Easy to operate with clear instruction manual==========Cons==========*Doesn’t have very good range as can be seen in my video*Sun causes glare on the screen, a built in sun shade for the controller would be really nice!Overall… Tons of fun! It’s going to make a great indoor quad this winter, especially with it having the 5.8ghz screen! It will make an incredible gift or something to occupy your indoor time during these cold weather months. Then once the weather breaks you can take it out and rip the skies with it!</p>

<h5 id="it-s-simply-awesome-it-has-a-very-easy-calibration">it’s simply awesome. It has a very easy calibration</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as flying this drone, it’s simply awesome. It has a very easy calibration, a fast takeoff and maneuvering. It&rsquo;s definitely a fun drone to fly. This is the second drone I’ve purchased and it&rsquo;s a lot of fun. Because of the size, I’m able to squeeze into tight places and fly very high and very fast. I love the high quality video and images this drone produces. The Flip Mode was very fun to mess with. So much features on this drone, I learn something new every time I take it out to fly. This is a great beginner/intermediate enthusiast.This drone is perfect in many ways. I love that the 5.8GHz remote control has a built in 4.3 inch LCD screen for camera viewing. The drone itself is about a 6 inch square and the built-in 720p HD camera is set to a fixed position. The package was very well packed with a replacement set of propellers, 2 batteries for remote control and 2 batteries for the drone, a charger, a 4GB microSD card and a USB microSD card reader.I would have loved if the button controls on the remote control were labeled. The LCD screen only displays the camera and does not display any of the settings on the screen. The batteries charge up very fast and can be charged by USB, Wall, Car or portable Power bank.For the price point, I highly recommend this drone. I also highly recommend anyone flying these drones to practice in an open area to get used to the controls and limit the amount of damage that can be caused from hitting objects around you.</p>

<h5 id="fun-item-happy-with-it">Fun item, happy with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just played with the drone for a little bit. Based on its being able to withstand my rough handling (novice pilot), a light dousing in the birdbath, and several rough landings and flying through a tree, it seems pretty tough. I got it because the controller included a video screen instead of requiring a phone and I like that feature in practice. So far I&rsquo;m happy with the package. Battery seems a little short lived but that is probably typical since the drone is so small. Only complaint I have is that no manual was included in the box by the manufacturer, but the seller (USA Toyz) was very good about finding an electronic copy and sending it well before the manufacturer did. Kudos to them.</p>

<h5 id="may-be-smaller-but-packs-a-punch-with-all-it-offers">May be smaller, but packs a punch with all it offers.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So pleased with how fast this came. Shipped and arrived before both estimated dates and came in perfect condition. First off, if you&rsquo;re thinking of getting this as a gift. Do it! The presentation is awesome and the box itself looks cool and not like a box for a toy. There&rsquo;s so much to say about this little drone. It&rsquo;s smaller but packs a punch! One of the most awesome things, is it&rsquo;s under the weight limit set by the government, so there&rsquo;s absolutely no need to register it! And while it may be a smaller drone, it is so powerful! It&rsquo;s a bit loud, but don&rsquo;t let that deter you, as it offers SO much. Like the fact that you don&rsquo;t have to buy batteries! BOTH the controller and the drone, have a battery in it already. But even better, they both have an extra back up battery too! And with ways to charge them both, it&rsquo;s a total win win. One of my favorite features is that it doesn&rsquo;t require your phone or for you to download an app! The controller has a built in screen with a great camera view! You can record video or take pictures and save them to the SD card! The screen brightness/quality is also adjustable to make it a clear picture in any environment. Set up was super easy and I was able to fly the drown within minutes of opening the package. It&rsquo;s so much fun and we will definitely be enjoying this often, as a family. I really like that it also come with extra spare blade parts! Makes replacement easy if you were to break the blades. (They seem pretty durable to me though)</p>

<h5 id="best-toy-of-2016">Best toy of 2016!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This drone is awesome! Me and my five year old took this baby out as soon as we got it. There is a park close to my house that has tons of free space and a soft landing in case you crash it and trust once you get a feel for it it&rsquo;s east to manage! It has a had camera attached to it so you can see on the controller screen everything the drone does!! It makes this toy in my opinion the best one this year!! It has easy controls for steering and makes it seem like the drone is almost hoovering in the sky!! The colors of this are red and black and I would say this is fun for all ages!! I love it and I&rsquo;m 32!!! And my 5 year old son has a blast with it!!</p>

<h5 id="overall-a-fun-drone-and-decent-value">Overall, a fun drone and decent value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a LOT of fun! Controls are easy enough to get the hang of. It has taken a few spills and tumbles and held up. My 12y/o son really likes it. It is a basic drone, I don&rsquo;t think the motors are replaceable, Force1 does offer replacement batteries and propellers.</p>
