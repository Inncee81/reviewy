<h5 id="read-this-i-have-some-tips-for-you-and-pictures">Read This! I have some tips for you, and pictures.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying this TV stand works pretty well. I&rsquo;m using it for my 43 inch Samsung television. The picture with the television and the stand show you how high the TV can be. This is also on the lowest setting. I could&rsquo;ve put it higher. The other picture the television shows you how far it will turn. Honestly, I wish it would turn a little further. It took about two hours to put together, so let me tell you some tips that will help you out. I have also attached some pictures to show you what you may miss.Tip #1 &ndash; Everything you need for the TV stand is in the bag with black nuts and bolts. The bag with the silver nuts and bolts is for attaching the TV. Don&rsquo;t forget the small square, flat, metal piece when bolting on the bracket. I believe this helps keep the bracket vertical. Just put it on the bolt and then bolt the bracket to the television.Tip #2 &ndash; People have mentioned zip ties, and I think I know why. If you look at my picture with the green and red arrows only, You will see a screw at the green arrow and the red arrow points to the TV bracket. It is the screw at the green arrow that needs to be put in the last. This is what tightens the bracket down onto the TV stand. I believe some people weren&rsquo;t figuring that out, and were using zip ties. If you use this screw it will be very tight. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to bolt on the cable holder. It can be seen at the back end of the red arrow. Stick your wires in that and snap it shut.Tip #3 &ndash; The picture with the red, green and blue arrows shows the screw better, and the spacer at the blue arrow. The spacers go between the TV bracket and television.Like everyone else, I didn&rsquo;t like the instructions. They really need to be redone. But if you take your time, you can get it.I hope this helps.</p>

<h5 id="well-worth-the-money">Well Worth The Money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I have peace of mind that my Samsung 60&rdquo; Plasma won&rsquo;t be tumbling down anytime soon with that flimsy 4-point stand it came with. Would you believe the factory stand is made of plastic and is held on by 4 little screws at the back near the base?! (LOL) Meanwhile, the Aeon stand attaches on the 4 mounting points that are made for wall mounts and are held on by LARGE screws. The base is nice and big and heavy, made of METAL, and reallysits the TV securely and with stability. The resistance of the swivel is adjustable and rotates smoothly. This is what the factory stand should have been.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-and-unparalleled-customer-service">Great product and Unparalleled Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this product because my new 55&rdquo; TV came with legs on the side instead on a stand attached to the middle of the unit.Before the Swivel TV Stand&rsquo;s arrival I was worried about how stable this stand was going to be holding my tv and placed top of the shelf I have reserved for it. After putting the thing together I realized it was far superior to any standard TV stand. Not only was it sturdy, but it looks and works fantastically. I saw some reviews on here where people complained about the 30 degree swivel seeming a little too short for their liking, but I have no idea why they would want it to turn anymore - its perfect the way it is.Sometimes people fail to realize that Amazon does not make or own everything they sell. I had a question about installation and I was answered back almost instantly and in a person matter. It&rsquo;s nice not to talk to a computer and be treated like a human being in 2015.When I upgrade to a wall mount or need speakers, I will be buying from this company again. Not even a question.</p>

<h5 id="best-investment-we-ever-made">Best investment we ever made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best investment we ever made. It is sturdy and doesn&rsquo;t shift. We just wanted something to raise up the TV more. This far exceeded our expectations. It raised it very high, which was what we wanted. Assembly was great, instructions great. Came with all the tools and parts. Husband said the wretch they gave would slip so you need another tool to hold it. TV even swivels, which I thought I didn&rsquo;t need and its great. I&rsquo;m so happy, I got to keep my new entertainment center I didn&rsquo;t like and this just added to it and now I&rsquo;m happy. Oh, you can also raise it or lower it with 3 different height adjustments.</p>

<p>One of the best products I have purchased on Amazon - mounted my LG 4 k 55 in - raised the TV so I could have my Mirage speakers on the glass shelf below. Use the swivel to get the angle I need</p>

<h5 id="an-excellent-product">An Excellent Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it when I find a product that is well designed, well built and comes with clear, intelligent documentation. That&rsquo;s exactly what I got when I purchased this product (and, trust me, this is a totally honest, unbiased review).First, when I posted a question on the Amazon website about the suitability of this stand for my TV, I got a reply from the seller within ONE hour. It was clear and accurate.Second, the packaging was perfect &amp; robust, as you would expect for a relatively heavy item.Third, the assembly directions were clearly written and well-illustrated. If you can&rsquo;t understand these, you really need to only buy things that are fully assembled.Fourth, the quality of the materials is terrific. My original Panasonic stand can&rsquo;t hold a candle to this. The base is glass-coated metal &ndash; heavy and durable &ndash; compared to my Panasonic&rsquo;s easy-to-scratch metal &amp; plastic base.Finally, all of the above doesn&rsquo;t matter if the stand doesn&rsquo;t perform properly&hellip;.and this does. Smooth swivel motion and rock solid.Overall, I recommend this without hesitation. This is the stand that SHOULD have come with the TV in the first place.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-for-the-price-on-a-very-solid-desktop-stand">Great value for the price on a very solid desktop stand.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really well built stand, Much nicer than I expected for the price. It took about 15 minutesto assemble by myself. It wasn&rsquo;t very difficult. It holds my 50&rdquo; TV perfectly and is very stable.The glass base is very thick and solid. Plus it swivels very smoothly. In the photo there is 8&rdquo;clearance from base to bottom of the TV. This is the highest &ldquo;setting&rdquo; It can drop down about 4&rdquo;from where it&rsquo;s set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dope-show">Dope show!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This actually looks much better in person and it looks more expensive. A very sleek looking design. It took me approx 20-30 minutes to put together and mount my tv. Really simple. The swivel is great it comes in handy often. Definitely buy this if you need to avoid a wall mount.</p>
