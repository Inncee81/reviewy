<p>Multiple Exposure Control
The EOS 70D offers a Multiple Exposure mode for film-like image creation with the convenience of in-camera processing. It offers two different compositing methods for proper exposure and composition: additive or average. Multiple exposure shots from 2 to 9 are stored as one final image and can be taken in both RAW and JPEG shooting modes. A RAW image previously captured by the EOS 70D (3:2 aspect ratio only) can be used as a starting point, and cumulative results can be observed and corrected in real time on the camera&rsquo;s LCD screen.</p>

<p>Handheld Night Scene mode
Handheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas, delivering results previously difficult without the use of a tripod. By shooting and combining four consecutive shots at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, the EOS 70D’s Handheld Night Scene mode makes dramatic nighttime photography simple.</p>

<p>HDR Backlight Control mode
The EOS 70D camera’s HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too darkly. By automatically shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.</p>

<p>Seven Creative Filters that can be displayed in real time
To add to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS 70D, the camera has seven different Creative Filters that can dramatically alter the mood and visual effect of any particular scene. Creative Filters include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, Art Bold Effect and Water Painting Effect. Each effect can be applied in three different levels (low, standard and strong), and easily previewed on the LCD panel in Live View. Since the filters can be applied to the image after shooting, it&rsquo;s easy to try several effects on the same shot during post-process.</p>

<p>Complex Functions Made Simple.
Scene Intelligent Auto mode
The EOS 70D features Scene Intelligent Auto mode, which incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation.</p>

With an array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS 70D camera.</p>

<p>Multi Shot Noise Reduction
To enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS 70D camera features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera’s sensor and the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor do. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the camera’s traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better.</p>

<p>Lens Aberration Correction
The EOS 70D features lens correction tools that compensate for lens characteristics that can affect overall image quality. The EOS 70D camera’s Peripheral Illumination Correction feature corrects light falloff in the corner of the image according to the characteristics of the lens being used. It even has correction data for a number of popular lenses stored in its memory. With the chromatic aberration correction tool, distracting color fringing can be corrected at the time of shooting.</p>

<p>Feature Guide
To help explain the specific function of features found on the EOS 70D, the Feature Guide displays a simple description helpful in determining the applicability for the situation at hand. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions. It appears automatically when a function is selected – a lifesaver when trying to determine the best mode or function for the next picture. The feature guide works automatically by default, and can be disabled easily through the camera’s menu.</p>

<p>GPS Compatible
With the optional GPS Receiver GP-E2 attached to the hot shoe or the digital terminal, the EOS 70D can record location, including latitude, longitude and altitude, and has the ability to track the trajectory of movement with its logging function, perfect for photographers on the go. An electric compass records the camera’s orientation during each shot, and world time information is recorded through GPS syncing.</p>

<p>Image Rating
To help organize images recorded to the camera’s storage, the EOS 70D makes it simple to rate individual images from one star to five. Therefore, image browsing, printing and slide shows can be based upon those ratings.</p>

<p>Compatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, including Ultra High Speed (UHS-I) cards
The EOS 70D uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC, and is even compatible with Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the camera’s compact design.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-vlogging-camera">Amazing Vlogging Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is this is a fantastic vlogging camera, which is the specific reason I bought it. If you&rsquo;re not interested in 4k, if you&rsquo;re a 1 man band, or just someone that wants to shoot a lot of great material and get it out to the world fast, this might be the camera for you.Already being the owner of a Canon 5D mark iii and mark iv, I am very familiar with the Canon brand. I do both still photography and videography, equally.I endeavored to help my wife start up a lifestyle vlog, and did a lot of research on cameras before picking this one. It made a lot of sense to me because I already own a lot of high-end Canon glass. However, owning full frame cameras, I don&rsquo;t have too many super wide angle lenses, that are better for this APC-S sized sensor. Please see below for a detailed analysis.VIDEOGRAPHY:Pros:-I love the articulating touch screen. To me, this is the main reason this camera beats the pants off of my 5D&rsquo;s for shooting video. You can place this camera high or low, left or right, face it at you or behind you, and turn the screen to see it. You can tap on the screen to focus or adjust properties easily.-Facial auto focus works really great! I know there is an upgraded camera (80D) that makes this better. But honestly, if you are looking to save some money, just get this camera. You&rsquo;re gonna be happy with the autofocus. It&rsquo;s fine.-Compared to my bigger cameras, this guy is really light weight-The menus are easy to navigate-the footage looks amazing-Shoots 24p-Sound is straightforward. You need an off camera mic, and you preferably want a powered mic so you can use the mic gain and not the camera&rsquo;s gain to get less hiss.-Can use any EF or EF-S lens.So you you are a canon shooter, you&rsquo;ve got a head start-Takes pretty nice photos too! Since I didn&rsquo;t buy this for photos, admittedly I haven&rsquo;t delved in. I would, truthfully, use my 5D Mark IV for a photo shoot. But for me, when I am out there shooting video, if I want to snap a few stills, this guy works great.Cons:-Not 4k (this is not a con for me, but if you want 4k, look elsewhere)-Not a high quality/high bit-depth format. (Again, this is not a huge deal for me. I&rsquo;m about story and speed over noodling with quality. I also own a BMPCC, and yes, shooting raw 10 or 12 bit is amazing&hellip; but you have to CC everything, do online/offline workflows, etc. so this is really more of a preference than a con. You have to know what you want to do. I think this camera wins for vlogging-Not as great with low light as other cameras. This camera caps off at ISO 6400. But realistically you wanna be at 800, 1600 max if you are good with seeing some noise. On my Mark IV I can shoot at 6400 and see no visible noise. But I mean, the Mark IV is like thousands of dollars more, so it&rsquo;s not a great comparison.-Its not full frame. Not a huge problem, neither was the Alexa I&rsquo;ve shot TV shows on for years. But, if you want full frame, this ain&rsquo;t it. So you need wider aperture lenses or to shoot really long lens if you want to get shallow depth of field.LENSES:On lenses, I did pick it up with the 18-55mm kit lens, then also bought the little 2.8 24mm pancake lens. They&rsquo;re both great lenses, actually&hellip; for the cost. The 18-55 has stabilization, so is better for hand held stuff, but needs more light. The 24mm makes the camera super light to carry, and also looks nice at 2.8. Both of these lenses autofocus great with the camera.So I disagree with some reviews out there that say don&rsquo;t get the kit lens. These days canon makes them pretty good and they are cheap in comparison to other lenses. So unless you have all the glass you need - get the kit lens. I usually get the short zoom kit lens because they are sharper and faster.Having used this camera for a few weeks, I really want to get something wider like the canon 10-22 or the sigma equivalent. I think there are times when being at a 10 to 14mm, especially out doors, would be helpful. I have not used either of these two lenses, my widest lens that is not a fisheye is the canon 15mm zoom.CONCLUSION:This camera may be on the older side right now, but I have to tell you I like it better for videography than my Mark IV. it&rsquo;s just so much faster and easier to use, and doesn&rsquo;t make you&rsquo;re wrist feel like it is going to break off. And because it is older, you can get it cheaper.Don&rsquo;t let all the posts and videos about technical quality hold you back from just going out there and creating. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about your talent and your stories. Tell them. I&rsquo;ve seen big TV shows with Alexa&rsquo;s suck. I&rsquo;ve seem people do amazing things with iPhones. It&rsquo;s not the cameras, its you and how you use them.So if you&rsquo;re gonna go tell stories, and you have about $1200 bucks to do so, get this camera, the kit lens, and an on camera mic. That&rsquo;s all you need. I promise you.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-camera-for-a-one-man-show">The Best Camera for a One Man Show</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I made the switch from Nikon (D3100) to Canon about one year ago. I started using DSLR&rsquo;s mainly for videos on YouTube and dabbling in photography. Although I would say my Nikon was more user friendly for beginners- settings wise, this was definitely the step up I needed. The main reason for making the switch was to find a camera that worked best for a one man show. The Canon 70D does everything for me and makes it that much easier. It&rsquo;s fast auto focus makes it easy to just hit record and start my video. I never have to ask myself &ldquo;am I in focus?&rdquo; or find myself surprised when I upload the footage into Sony Vegas. The flip out screen also helps in framing the shot by myself. Overall I upgraded to make my life easier when it came to filming, and it did just that. If you are purchasing this camera for beginner photography, I always recommend the T6i&rsquo;s to get to know the basics. But if you&rsquo;re willing to splurge a little, I say hey why not. I love how quick the camera is in shooting photos and I never have to feel like i&rsquo;m missing a shot. The LCD screen is also seamless and is very true to color.</p>

<h5 id="pleasantly-surprised">Pleasantly surprised!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit worried about ordering this camera, given that it&rsquo;s about $200 less than Amazon is selling the same camera for. It came in brand new in the box, with all of the accessories (strap, cords, instructions, etc). It is exactly the same as the one being sold for 1100 on here, so if all you need is the body and you&rsquo;re trying to decide between the two, go with this one!</p>

<h5 id="the-audio-is-a-deal-breaker">The audio is a deal-breaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is toted by reviewers online as being one of the best in terms of video quality. Well that&rsquo;s true, but the audio is filled with the infamous audio background hiss. The shotgun mic it comes with doesn&rsquo;t have a setting to limit sound input to +20 or +40 dB. So basically the mic is not much better than the built-in camera mic.The picture quality is very high-quality as is the video quality. The audio is a deal-breaker though. You NEED an external mic with adjustable dB.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent beginner camera for any Video shooters.I&rsquo;ve been using the Canon 70d for about 2 years now. I am in the process of purchasing my third one. I produce music videos, wedding videos, promotional films, and similar types of video. Occasionally my work ends up on TV, and the quality has never disappointed.I get comments all the time about how amazing the color saturation is, it is really so awesome.Most Videographers in my field use a Canon 5D Mark iii but I flat out refuse to upgrade.What I rely on the most with this camera is the articulating screen, that is touch sensitive, along with the Dual Pixel Auto Focus. All of these features are unavailable on the higher end Canon cameras. I am not going to lie, I would LOVE a full frame sensor, but I am not willing to lose the other HUGE benefits of this camera just to get a full frame sensor. One day I would hope that Canon will offer a DSLR that offers the articulating, touch screen with Dual Pixel AF, that has a full frame sensor.The Canon C100 has a great constant autofocus, but it only focuses in the center of the frame, which makes it hard to frame up the way that I would like most of the time.</p>
