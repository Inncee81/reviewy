<h5 id="great-camera-for-the-price">Great Camera for the Price!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This was exactly what I was looking for, &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; of an accident, or capture something cool. Quality of the camera is excellent, as well as great video quality. Price is a key factor as I did not want to spend several hundred dollars. The only drawback is the instructions. The ones that come with it are pretty much useless, however they send a PDF file via E-mail the same day you order it, or the next. It is better.One other thing is that when the camera is plugged into a cigarette lighter for power, the camera will turn on automatically and shut off automatically as long as power to your cigarette lighter port shuts down after turning the car off. Now if you have a vehicle that always has a power supply active you can manually shut off the camera.. You can shut the camera on and off with the power button on the lower right side.• Unit must be in “pause” mode to change settings. When the unit is recording the top right of the LCD display shows the record time for that segment in RED.• Once in pause mode, push “M” button once to enter mode to change Resolution, Cycle Record (loop times) WDR, Motion Detection, Audio, Date stamp, Gravity Sensing.• Push “M” button twice to enter mode to change Date/Time, Beep Sound, Language, Frequency, Screen savers, Light Set, Parking Guard, License Number Set, Format, Default Setting, and Version.• Once you enter one of the modes, use the up and down buttons to scroll to the criteria you want to change, Date/ Time as an example. It will be highlighted in light blue.• Then press the “OK” button to enter the window to actually change those settings. The up and down arrows can then be used to select the correct date and time. Press the “OK” button to move to the next segment of date or time criteria.• When finished with any of the setting adjustments, press the “M” button to exit.• The “Up Arrow button can also be used to mute the audio recording, when in recording mode. The mic symbol will show a red “X” through it, indicating it is in mute mode.The only issue I found was because of the wide angle fish eye lens the left and right sides of the video are a bit blurry when played back. Also sometimes on playback the video sometimes for a split second speeds up then returns to normal. Not a very big deal and is hardly noticeable.I hope this review helped in some way. Please hit the helpful button if it did. I would greatly appreciate it if you did. Thank you, happy shopping.</p>

<h5 id="good-value">Good value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the size and quality of the camera itself. It is a good value, but the SD card needs to be purchased separately, so keep that in mind. The only issue we had was with the mount, which broke within a month of owning the camera. The manufacturer offered to replace it but we had already purchased a replacement, so they gave me a partial refund instead.</p>

<h5 id="get-protected-on-the-road">【Get Protected on the Road!】</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> 【Well Packaged】The box included the dash camera, high-quality suction cup window mount, owner&rsquo;s manual, and USB adapter, 12V socket plug with around 10FT in length, etc. Surprisingly, the seller also has one 16GB Memory Card included in the box so that I could use it the right way after the package is open and don&rsquo;t have to spend another 2 days to purchase a new TF card on Amazon. Thank you.【Easy Setup】Simple and easy to set up, just insert the micro SD card, install the travel suction cup mount on the windshield, and plug to the power supply, then the camera is ready to use. (For your information, LAW requires the dash camera should be installed to three certain areas on the windshield if you drive in California. More restriction may apply.) Software for viewing recorded data is very informative and also with many features included.The front area is a piece of thick, heavy, and solid metal to protect the body. Also, the weight is heavy enough to prevent the camera from any shaking too much on the road. Why not? Anyone prefers stable pictures.Most important thing is that it starts recording immediately when I jump in my car and start the ignition and it closes itself automatically about 10 seconds after the engine is off or unplug the USB cord from the power adapter. So actually I don&rsquo;t have to do any operation on the camera so it&rsquo;s designed to be installed and sort of forgotten about. Everything is automatically taken care of.【Video Quality】This camera is 170-degree wide angle and can record 1080P videos in decent picture quality. I can see clearly the traffic signal even in direct sunlight as I&rsquo;m entering the intersection and I can see the plate number in front which means the camera performs great in all high light conditions (Please see the uploaded video of my drive in the City of Irvine, CA.). I am really satisfied with the lens performance. Video clips can be set as one, three, and more minutes long. The loop recording is also available. 3.0&rdquo; LCD cell phone level screen is used on it. The video looks great with all the details.One thing I don&rsquo;t like it no night light function. So I have to switch to the other dash cam to record in the night.【Real protection on the road】I have not been using dash-cam until recently since I realize if I was hit by someone on the freeway, the videos on the dash-cam would be my only chance to win the lawsuit, and also greatly reduce the work of related insurance agent and the Police officer. Everyone would be happy.【Battery Performance】It was claimed that the camera supports around a couple of hours video recording when fully charged based on my test of the battery. But it is advised to connect the camera to power supply all the time if possible.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I really hope my user experience and this review could help you!!!</p>
