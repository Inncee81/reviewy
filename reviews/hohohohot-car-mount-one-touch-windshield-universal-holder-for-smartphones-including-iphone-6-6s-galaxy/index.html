<h5 id="works-exactly-as-advertised-best-screen-protector-i-have-owned">Works EXACTLY As Advertised, Best Screen Protector I Have Owned!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FIRST screen protector I&rsquo;ve ever bought that worked the FIRST time, was EASY to apply, done without fear, worked as advertised and NO BUBBLES. Fantastic. I had seen a guy on youtube who applied one with one hand, while taping it with the other, and that&rsquo;s when I said &ldquo;Sign me up&rdquo;.Touch and Feel &hellip; It feels great! You get solid screen protection without sensitivity loss or interference. Because of it&rsquo;s relative low cost, and the fact I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Moshi before, I was a little skeptical as to it&rsquo;s protection and haptic feedback properties. You know how the cheap screen protectors seem to feel like thick sheets of plastic that affect the routine touch-use of your phone or tablet? Not this one, it protects your device without getting in its way, and does so with aplomb!I&rsquo;m big on Screen Protectors, the first thing I do, when I get a new Phone or Tablet is to rush out and buy one - sometimes, I even order one before I get the product. In the past, I&rsquo;ve forked out for the expensive ones (Zaggs, Military-Grade Armour), etc. and I don&rsquo;t mind spending extra to protect my precious investment &hellip;&hellip; but Install has always been a hit-or-miss proposition for me - sometimes good, sometimes not. I&rsquo;ve even bought Zagg film at a Best Buy (or on Amazon) and paid for the guy at the booth in the mall to install it, just to ensure I don&rsquo;t end up having to buy it again. Because the price of this is a lot less than the premium types mentioned, I had my doubts as to how good it could actually be.After it arrived, opened it up, followed the simple instructions and shocked myself to learn it was all TRUE; every positive review I had read, all the info on the web, and yes, the youtube video &hellip; took me about 5 or 10 seconds to &ldquo;install&rdquo; it and now my Fire HD 6 is protected.My advice to you is to buy one. Get one for your tablet, one for your phone, and put a few on your wish list, just so you know where to find it, when you buy your next device. Outstanding all around - thank you Moshi, thank you Amazon&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-phone-mount">I love this phone mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this phone mount. It stuck easily to my windshield and I was able to place it out of the way of vents or my line of vision. I like that the arm is long enough to make placement easy for wherever you decide to stick it (in my case, I have it sideways in the lower left hand side of my window. I have a tiny car, so this was perfect and out of the way). The holder fit easily over my iPhone 6 otter box. I had ordered one of the magnetic versions that said it would hold through the otter box, but no dice. The arms squeeze in and there is an easy release button. Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for something hands free for your car.Other reviews mentioned shaking and noise when the phone was not in the mount. I have not experienced any of this with mine. It works great, no complaints - love this thing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-after-a-few-months-no-complaints">Works great after a few months. No complaints</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works surprisingly well. Hasn&rsquo;t fallen off of my windshield and it&rsquo;s been maybe three or four months since I bought the thing. It&rsquo;s adjustable on the sides and on the bottom so it can hold different size phones, and it has a button to release the side panels when you want to take it out. The side panels are padded so you&rsquo;re not scratching up your phone. I have no complaints about this product. I was actually fairly surprised because these things are usually pretty crummy, and you can&rsquo;t exactly test anything out on Amazon without buying it first, so I was prepared for disappointment. So far, so good. Hopefully it holds up because I&rsquo;m pretty much addicted to my phone at this point and this device makes it so I don&rsquo;t have to hold it (my phone is too big for the cup holders and little cubbies in my car).</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my car phone holder this was a great choice affordable price and does a great job, this phone mount surpassed my expectations also rotates 360</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-love-it">Amazing , love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really did not have much faith this was going to work but wow I was wrong ! It holds my iPhone 5 perfect and it was so easy to install. It sure makes one more thing in my life go a little easier. Don&rsquo;t hesitate in this one . I will be ordering in for each of my kids !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="case-protects-well-but-it-does-not-have-replaceable-screen-protectors">Case protects well, but it does not have replaceable screen protectors.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mine arrived with a scratched screen protector, not enough of a problem for the hassle and expense of returning to Amazon, but I expected Gumdop to replace it under warranty since manufacturing cost for this one part can be no more than 5 cents. I tried multiple times, but they kept refusing to honor the warranty, instead, telling me to just return it to Amazon.This case does a good job of protecting the tablet, but with the poor attitude Gumdrop has toward their customers, I will never buy one of their products again. If you are looking at this case due to the protection it offers, take a look at the BobJ cases also sold here on Amazon. They should protect just as well, and they have a good customer service reputation on the tablet forums. I wish I had bought one of theirs, along with a high quality screen protector. I would have been better off, and cheaper.EDIT:Gumdrop made things right with me, but they also again confirmed that they do not sell the screen seperately, even though it says so right on the package. When I pointed out this fact, they said that they did not realize that, and that they just dont get enough call for them. What difference does that make? If they advertise that they sell them, then they need to.</p>

<h5 id="good-design-adjustable">Good design, adjustable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Five stars says it all, it&rsquo;s a great product. Well designed and seemingly durable. Adjustable to any phone size, it rotates without fuss so you can use it vertically or horizontally. We now run the phone&rsquo;s camera often &ndash; took a quick pick of a reckless driver on the highway in case we needed to report him; also the front camera to send road pics of all of us! Also put one in the kitchen to keep phone handy and off the counter, great for reading recipes &ndash; it holds a suction on the counter top for hours.</p>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it. Easy on, Easy off. Stays firm.</p>

<p>Works well. Versatile. Holds the GPS and the phone. Vibrates a bit when driving at high speeds, but so does everything else.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-buy-it">PERFECT. BUY IT.</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a 10. I rarely review things, and this is just the perfect cell phone holder for a vehicle. Just be sure in advance that you have a smooth surface either on your console or&hellip;</p>

<p>Not very sturdy when making sharp turns.</p>

<h5 id="sticks-great-and-it-holds-my-iphone-6-plus">Sticks great and it holds my Iphone 6 plus</h5>

<p>It moves a lot while driving and phone sometimes falls from all the movement. Sticks great and it holds my Iphone 6 plus</p>

<h5 id="it-s-perfect">It&rsquo;s perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I put this on my windshield right behind the mirror. It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>

<h5 id="bouncy">Bouncy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works, but between my heavy phone case and less than smooth-riding car, the phone bounces around a lot. It bounces securely, mind you, but it&rsquo;s a real visual nuisance.</p>

<h5 id="suction-cup-didn-t-last">Suction Cup didn&rsquo;t last.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This car mount worked great for about 3 months and then suction cup part feel apart. I attempted to glue it back together and nothing.</p>
