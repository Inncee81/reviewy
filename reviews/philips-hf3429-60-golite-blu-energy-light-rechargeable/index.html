<blockquote>
<p>Purchased about a month ago and wanted to give it some time before reviewing. There are &ldquo;warnings&rdquo; regarding possible side effects when starting use with this as with many things. I always assume I will not be one of the people experiencing them because I go into whatever with a very positive attitude.I use this Mon-Fri (as long as I remember) at work. I am in an office with no direct outside light and because I do a lot of design work, I do not have the office overhead light on but rather use a combination of three lamps&ndash;in other words, a more moderate light situation than most offices with the glaring flouresants. Although the lighting has been much easier on my eyes, I also began experiencing issues with my sleep patterns and suspected the low light was adding to the problem.So first week, I was shocked I did experience side-effects. I was on the lowest setting but I still felt a little light-headed and kind of queasy. Since I knew it was a possibility and that the manufacturer advised it would go away after the first week or so, I pressed through. Second week, not as bad and third week negative side effects gone. AND the addition of some very positive ones. This was all a part of me getting more aware and proactive about my sleep so about the same time I got this I added Twilight (for Android) to my G-2 phone and F.lux to my laptop.The combined effect has been wonderful. I now get sleepy earlier at night helping me get into bed in time for 8 hours and still up early (6-6:30) to utilize my most productive time of day-morning.My sleep has been better and I am ready to be awake earlier. Throughout the day my energy level is much better. Last fall, after about 6 months working in this low light environment, I began to have a serious lack of energy. Arriving home at night fixing a meal was about all the energy I had. In the past weeks this has been steadily changing. This past Saturday I was active from rising to bedtime and only felt the natural need to rest not the exhausted feeling I&rsquo;ve had. So while purchasing and using this has combined with some other steps I have taken, I believe this little blue light gets the lion&rsquo;s share of the credit for what I believe is just the beginning of a much healthier me.As for product details, it&rsquo;s compact, light-weight and easy to use. The battery is a nice feature allowing for placement without being limited to the nearest plug. I have yet to go beyond the second level of light (there are four). When I first turn it on, it does &ldquo;smack you in the face,&rdquo; but I do as instructed and have an overhead light on as well. Once I get it positioned I am aware of it at first, then I &ldquo;forget&rdquo; it &hellip; to the end I am usually going for 20 minutes a side (you place it so it shines on the side of your face) and will all of a sudden &ldquo;remember&rdquo; it, look over and I&rsquo;m already into 30 or sometimes 40 minutes on that one side.Yep, I am very happy with my purchase and glad I added this to my wellness items.</p>

<h5 id="previous-white-light-user-you-may-be-surprised-i-was">Previous white light user? You may be surprised. I was.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using a NatureBright 10,000 lux light box for several years to treat my SAD, which became quite disruptive to my normal life several years ago. You can read my review of that product; I feel it has helped me tremendously. So I was interested to try the Philips Golite Blue Energy light, because it uses blue light and not white, like the NatureBright box. The unit does have some advantages:- It is very compact and portable, making it easy to take into another room, to the office, etc.- It can either be plugged-in or run on its rechargeable battery.- The intensity of the light has several settings. I must admit, it took me a few uses to get the right &ldquo;touch&rdquo; on the unit to adjust the light. You, being more technologically advanced than me, will probably wonder what I am talking about. LOLIt has one major disadvantage, as well:- It is so compact that I think it is hard to make sure I am always sitting the correct distance away, with the unit in my field of vision. This is not a problem with my larger NatureBright unit. I&rsquo;d imagine it would not be a problem with a larger Philips blue light unit, either.What I was NOT prepared for, however, was my response to the light. I have been using the NatureBright light for a couple of weeks now, since I noticed the days getting longer. As always, it was keeping my mood even. But whenever I use the Philips Golite blue light, I get jittery, a little shaky and slightly anxious. Decreasing the light intensity has not helped. I cannot explain this reaction, and it was certainly unexpected. I have not been able to find an answer on the internet, but any light therapy can have an overly stimulatory effect. I have had to stop using it because of this side effect. For what it&rsquo;s worth, my husband has the same reaction to it, and he does NOT use a white light box on a regular basis.So, if you are a white light user, just be aware that you might have an unusual reaction to this unit. And if you have never used light therapy and you have a more or less anxiety-producing reaction to this unit, give a 10,000 lux white light unit a try. If you really want to know more about light therapy, look up the Center for Environmental Therapeutics website (sorry, we&rsquo;re not allowed to put links in these reviews). CET is headed up by a psychiatrist at Columbia University who has done a LOT of research on light therapy. There is a lot of good information on the CET website, so read up and see what works for you.P.S. I actually wish I could review this as an information review, without any stars. I couldn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars, because of my reaction to the unit. I didn&rsquo;t want to give it 1 star, because that was unfair. So I chose a neutral 3-star rating to reflect the fact that the unit has advantages and disadvantages and for ME, it did not work as expected.</p>

<p>i have had this light for only a few weeks. I have previously used a 10000lux light for my winter blues. I like this model better so far (it seems to work equivalently for me). It is small, light, and with a rechargeable battery - portable!!As I am a nurse and move to different areas to chart or take a break, this is a huge bonus for me. I actually use this every day because it&rsquo;s portability makes it not cumbersome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My GoLITE is my second cup of coffee in the morning! I have SAD and winters in Cleveland can be pretty tough so I was in search of something to help me stay chipper in the long cold months ahead. My dear friend, Adam, suggested this light for me. It only took a few days and it worked. No joke! I no longer have that second cup of coffee or 3 pm crash. And you may wonder how I know if it&rsquo;s working. Well. When I don&rsquo;t on the weekends I drag ass! Big time. Do yourself a favor. But one now!</p>

<h5 id="great-portable-unit">Great portable unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this little light box. I feel more energized after sitting next to it and my body actually seems surprised and slightly confused when I look out and see a rainy overcast sky. It does the trick for me. I wish I had gotten one of these years ago. I use it for the full hour at the highest brightness and never have any jitters, headaches, or anything some of the other reviewers claim. I carry it with me from room to room if I&rsquo;m on the move and it&rsquo;s super small and easy to fit anywhere. I didn&rsquo;t give a fifth star because the battery only lasts one hour and then it&rsquo;s completely dead. I have to remember to charge it every night. Otherwise I love it.</p>
