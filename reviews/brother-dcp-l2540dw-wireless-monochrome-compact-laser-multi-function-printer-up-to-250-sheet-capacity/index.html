<h5 id="great-printer-deep-sleep-fixed">Great printer! Deep Sleep = FIXED!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you get the settings straight, this printer is A+. This review will not focus on it&rsquo;s advertised features, but I can confirm that it does indeed do everything it says it will, fantastically. For a more in depth review on that kind of stuff, look at the other reviews. Really nothing more can be said that has not already been said.First off, let me start off by saying that this printer was a pain in the butt to setup. I have been tinkering with and building computers since the mid 90&rsquo;s, and this one threw me for a loop for a few hours. After searching and searching and toggling this and toggling that, I was finally able to remedy the &ldquo;Deep Sleep&rdquo; issue that most, if not all, OSX/iOS users have with this printer.The printer would work great for a few minutes, then you&rsquo;d hear a click inside of the machine followed by unresponsiveness and &ldquo;Deep Sleep&rdquo; on the screen. Nothing would &ldquo;bring it to life&rdquo; but a reboot of the machine. You could not pull toner levels from it, load it&rsquo;s browser-based interface, or send print jobs. Upgrading the firmware seemed to fix a lot of people&rsquo;s&rsquo; problems but it did not fix my problem.To cut to the chase, these are the 3 settings I changed to fix this problem. They&rsquo;re accessed in the printers browser-based settings. You might have success changing these on the actual printer itself, but I did not try this. To access this page on Windows, open your web browser and for the URL, put in the IP of the printer. For example, my printer is set to the IP of 10.0.0.177 so I simply typed that in the address bar of Chrome and pressed enter. If you do not know your printers IP, on the printer, press Menu then goto Network&gt; WLAN&gt; TCP/IP&gt; IP Address.Once you&rsquo;re at the web-interface, these are the settings that I changed:General Tab&gt; Status&gt; Automatic Refresh: On1) Network Tab&gt; Wireless Sub-Tab&gt; TCP/IP (Wireless)&gt; Boot Method: STATIC2) Network Tab&gt; Wireless Sub-Tab&gt; TCP/IP (Wireless)&gt; Enable APIPA: UN-CHECKED3) Network Tab&gt; Wireless Sub-Tab&gt; TCP/IP (Wireless)&gt; IPv6 Sub-Menu&gt; IPv6: EnabledAll other settings left stock.It will prompt you to restart the printer, and once it&rsquo;s back on, everything should be golden. All setttings work like a charm INCLUDING airprint! Many people were having problems with that. You will also notice that the printer responds very quickly when accessing various settings and data through the browser-interface.This fix worked for my wireless setup, the same should go for a wired setup too. While changing the settings, goto Wired instead of Wireless. Good luck to you all.</p>

<p>Good for light to moderate black and white printing, copying, and scanning* GENERAL INFORMATION and SET UPThis Brother DCPL2540DW Monochrome Laser Multi Function Printer / Copier / Scanner has a small footprint, and comes with a 35 page automatic document feeder (ADF), adjustable 250 page capacity paper tray, starter toner cartridge, but not a USB cable (most printers these days don&rsquo;t ship with USB / printer cables anymore). The on-device control interface has a two-line lcd display and a few labeled buttons. The on-device menuing system is at most 3 levels deep only, and is easy to navigate using the MENU, +/UP, -/DOWN, OK, and STOP/EXIT buttons. The device is easy to set up for wireless printing, and if you have a USB / printer cable, for wired printing as well. The included Basic User&rsquo;s Guide is minimalistic but sufficient to get you started in the right direction, and a link to a fuller online user&rsquo;s guide is provided.I have a USB cable so I initially set this device up for wired printing from my Windows 8.1 computer. The device driver that&rsquo;s automatically installed after Windows detected the device is not a full-featured driver, so I installed the MFL-Pro Software Suite from the included CD. Once that software suite has been installed, if you bring up the Devices and Printers view from the Windows Control Panel and right-click on the icon for this printer, you&rsquo;ll see that the context menu that pops up has separate Printing Preferences and Printer Properties menu items. The Properties dialog box gives you options such as what pages of your document to print, and a check box to select or unselect duplex printing. The Preferences dialog box gives you options such as enable Print Preview, and Print Document with a custom settable Watermark (such as the word Confidential, or Draft, etc).After some initial testing of the printing and scanning functionalities (discussed more below), I went back to the MFL-Pro Software Suite mentioned above to set the device up for wireless operations, which required some software to be installed, detection of your network, and providing the appropriate password for your wireless network. The set up process was a breeze and I did not encounter any problem.* PRINTINGThe print speed is as advertised &ndash; about 30 pages per minute (ppm), slower of course if you&rsquo;re printing double-sided. You can set resolution to 300, 600, and 1200 dpi. Both text and graphics outputs are clear and crisp. To save money, if the documents you&rsquo;re printing are not that important, you can enable &lsquo;Toner Save&rsquo; option, and / or print multiple document pages per output page. I&rsquo;ve done several 30-50 page print jobs, and have so far not experienced paper jams.You can use different sized paper, including legal and envelopes, by just adjusting the paper guides. Printing on envelopes requires more work that&rsquo;s described in the user&rsquo;s guide, but there is a cool video in the manufacturer&rsquo;s support website that shows you what to do. If you have the MFL-Pro Software Suite mentioned above installed, look for the Brother Utilities desktop icon and click on it, then choose Support -&gt; On-line help and FAQ&rsquo;s. On the manufacturer&rsquo;s &ldquo;FAQ&rsquo;s and Troubleshooting&rdquo; web page that this gets you to, look for the Video FAQs in the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; category, and you&rsquo;ll see an entry for Printing on Envelopes.One thing I noticed with printing is that once a document is opened, changes to Printing Preferences (say, enabling or disabling printing watermarks) do not take effect until you close and reopen the document, which can come as a surprise to some.* SCANNINGYou can scan by putting your documents through the automatic document feeder or placing them one at a time onto the scanner glass. There is an on-device SCAN button that you can press, but I find it easier to control scanning using the software installed on my Windows computer. Click on the Brother Utilities desktop icon if you have the above-mentioned MFL-Pro Software Suite installed, then select SCAN -&gt; ControlCenter4 (CC4). With the CC4, you can do Image or OCR scans, and save the results in formats such as JPEG, TIFF, Windows Bitmap, PNG, PDF, Searchable PDF, etc. By default, the results will be saved to labeled folders within the Control Center 4 folder under Documents&gt;Pictures, unless you specify a different location.If you have a supported email application such as Microsoft Outlook, you can set things up so that scan results can be automatically attached to an email. Because I only use free web mail services (which are not supported), I wasn&rsquo;t able to test this functionality.Scanning speed is fast. In my testing, I can confirm that saving results into JPEG, PDF, and Searchable PDFs did work without a problem at all (I did not attempt to save the results into the other possible formats).* COPYINGThere are two limited ways you can achieve 2-sided copying if you want to save paper.The first way is to place the document you want to copy one page at a time onto the scanner glass. Before you start copying, press the on-device OPTION button to navigate to the Two-Sided menu option, temporarily enable it, then press the START button. With this method, you will be asked to manually flip the document when the device is ready to fill up the back of an output sheet.The second way is to feed the pages of your document through the automatic document feeder (ADF). Again, before you start copying, press the on-device OPTION button to navigate to the Two-Sided menu option, temporarily enable it, then press the START button. What you&rsquo;ll get is the following: Say you feed two sheets of paper to the ADF, and each sheet contains the word &ldquo;FRONT&rdquo; on one side, and &ldquo;BACK&rdquo; on the other side. If you stack these input sheets such that the sides with the word &ldquo;FRONT&rdquo; are facing UP, both sides of the single output sheet will contain the word &ldquo;FRONT.&rdquo; So this method makes sense only if you want to save paper by copying single-sided inputs to double-sided outputs.* TONER CARTRIDGEYou can replace the included starter toner cartridge with either the TN630 (max yield approximately 1200 pages) or TN660 (max yield approximately 2600 pages) cartridges. At the time of this review, the TN630 and TN660 are selling in Amazon for about 43 and 68 dollars, respectively.</p>

<h5 id="you-can-have-a-perfectly-good-cartridge-in-the-machine">You can have a perfectly good cartridge in the machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This printer has two dealbreakers. First, there is no override when it thinks it is out of ink. It &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; it is out of ink long, long, long before it really is. Most Brother printers have a secret sequence of buttons that you can press to bypass the low toner warning, but this one does not, and it completely stops printing until you give it a brand new cartridge. You can have a perfectly good cartridge in the machine, but if it takes the notion that you need to change cartridges, you cannot print ANYTHING. If you don&rsquo;t happen to have a spare somewhere, you are done printing until you go run out and buy one. So stupid to not have an override option.The other dealbreaker is that there is a heat fuser that is low quality and shatters. Based on what I can find on messageboard forums with other users having identical issues, this seems to be a reasonably widespread problem, and it happened to mine. It causes a smudged line the whole way down the page, to the point that blotches of ink are peeling off of the paper when it prints. If Brother had honored their warranty, no problem, but they&rsquo;ve given me the runaround for weeks to the point it&rsquo;s not worth my time to keep arguing with them.Brother makes good printers, but stay away from this model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wifi-doesn-t-stay-connected">WIFI doesn&rsquo;t stay connected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;ve rated this printer so low is that is doesn&rsquo;t stay connected via WIFI. It should &lsquo;wake up&rsquo; when a print job is sent however it doesn&rsquo;t. I end up having to reconnect it each time to the WIFI connection or use a cable from the printer to my laptop. I&rsquo;ve tried using their support and they just tell me that it should &lsquo;wake up&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m very disappointed with this purchase and the support I&rsquo;ve received trying to get this resolved. If you plan to use this printer remotely via WIFI I do not recommend it. Otherwise it works fine when used with a cable connection.</p>

<p>Great quality printing, cheap for it&rsquo;s class of printers, easy to set up. I don&rsquo;t even need it near a computer to use with its built in wireless connectivity.</p>
