<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>An all-around lens ideal for creative photography and movies, Canon’s EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM adds cutting-edge technology to an extremely flexible zoom range. Delivering remarkable performance for everyday capture, it’s equipped with Canon’s new NANO USM technology, featuring high-speed and near-silent AF. What’s more, it’s also compatible with Canon’s new Power Zoom Adapter PZ-E1 for more natural zooming during movie capture. For landscapes, portraits, sports videos and everything in between, the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM provides great versatility with its magnificent optics, comprehensive zoom range and premium design. It’s an impressive complement to the EOS 80D camera, or any EOS camera with an APS-C size sensor.</p>

<p>Equipped with new NANO USM technology combining Ring USM and STM for smooth and near-silent video and high-speed AF for still capture.</p>

<p>Fast and incredibly quiet, the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM’s new NANO USM AF system not only delivers high speed AF, but also makes quiet, fast and smooth AF transitions that can be ideal for movie recording. Combining ring USM and STM (lead-screw type) features, the diminutive chip-shaped ultrasonic motor is engineered to help deliver high-speed, smooth, precise and near-silent operation, plus full time manual focus (when using one-shot AF).</p>

<p>Improved AF speeds up to 4.3x* (Tele) and 2.5x* (Wide) for faster autofocus.
Thanks to its new NANO USM motor, the Canon EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM focuses incredibly fast – a clear advantage for action photography and for working on the fly. Compared to the previous model<em>, it focuses approximately 4.3 times</em> faster at the telephoto end, and 2.5 times* faster at the wide end when using the viewfinder, for a noticeable speed advantage that can help ensure a stellar photo.</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on Canon’s standards. As compared to the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS STM.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compatible with new Power Zoom Adapter PZ-E1, providing electrical zooming that helps deliver more natural zooming while shooting video.</p>

<p>The EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM is compatible with Canon’s new Power Zoom Adapter PZ-E1 for electronically controlled zooming. This convenient accessory works with the lens to enhance an EOS camera’s video capabilities by providing a smooth and near-silent powered zooming function that’s an ideal complement to the lens’s speedy AF. The PZ-E1 has adjustable zoom speeds, an integrated locking mechanism, offers remote controlled zooming and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM for streamlined operability.</p>

<p>Image Stabilizer effect at up to 4* stops of shake correction helps capture sharp images.</p>

<p>Thanks to a newly enhanced Image Stabilizer system that features a more rigid mechanical structure and the incorporation of faster algorithms, the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM’s Image Stabilizer effect has been improved from 3.5 stops to 4* stops for better performance in even more challenging situations. Whether shooting in low light or any time a slow shutter speed is necessary, the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM’s Image Stabilizer helps deliver stable, sharp results.</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on CIPA (Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association) standards. Testing performed using the EOS 7D Mark II digital SLR camera at a focal length of 135mm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamic IS helps reduce camera shake when shooting video for improved image quality even when the user is in motion.
When recording video, the EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM’s Dynamic IS system helps compensate for camera shake such as when handholding the camera or making movies while walking, especially when using wide focal lengths. By compensating for the camera’s motion, it helps deliver sharp, accurately focused images with ease.</p>

<p>One UD lens and one PMo aspheric lens help provide high-resolution and high-contrast images with reduced chromatic aberration throughout the zoom range.
The EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM features a number of advanced Canon optics to provide a sharp, high-resolution picture throughout its zoom range. Featuring a UD lens and a high-precision aspherical lens element, its optical formula helps reduce chromatic aberrations, flare and ghosting, reliably delivering excellent results.</p>

<p>Premium exterior design includes a satin finish, sleek silhouette, black ring and metallic mount for high performance with a sophisticated look and feel.
The EF-S 18–135mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM features a new exterior design that gives it a feel of power and refinement. An elegant shape, comfortable zooming and focus rings as well as easy-to-read markings complement its new finish. A metallic mount and a new black ring that separates the zoom and focus rings add to the lens’s feeling of quality.</p>

<h5 id="fast-and-silky-smooth-af">Fast and silky smooth AF</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The EF-S 18-135 3.5-5.6 IS USM covers a zoom range of moderately wide to telephoto, making it ideal for general use, e.g., travel, landscapes and portraits. It’s Canon’s first Nano USM design and combines the smooth focus of STM with the speed of USM, making it equally at home with video and still shooting.CONSTRUCTION: excellent fit and finish, sturdy plastics and metal mount. Cosmetics are striped down, almost Gothic, losing the chrome and gold rings of similar prior designs. While not a small lens, it’s reasonably light and compact considering the wide zoom range. The underside sports a barrel lock (to prevent zoom drift) and interface for the Power Zoom Adapter PZ-E1.FOCUS: A Nano USM Motor drives an internal lens group and the front element doesn&rsquo;t rotate or extend during focusing. I must say Nano USM lives up to the hype: smooth as silk for pulls and movie servo but but nearly as fast as Ring USM for stills. In fact, AF speed and accuracy compares favorably with my EF-s 15-85 3.5-5.6 IS USM.Manual focus (MF) is possible without switching out of AF mode: simply grip and turn. However MF is wholly electronic so the shutter button must be half depressed for manual focus to work. The focus ring is wider than the prior 18-135 STM and easy to grab for pulls.ZOOM: The zoom ring is large, covered with ribbed rubber, well damped and does not creep. A nested barrel extends considerably—adding about 2 inches in length&ndash;when racked out to 135mm.OPTICAL QUALITY: Initially this lens was slightly soft with the 45-point AF system of my 80D. The dual-pixel AF (contrast focus) in LiveView was tack sharp so I figured an AFMA (Autofocus Microadjustment) session was in order. The wide end needed +6 while the telephoto side needed +4 to render tack sharp photos from close focus to infinity. The bottom line is, after AFMA, this lens is very sharp.Blazing Hawaiian sunsets result in little or no ghosting and flare, and typical high contrast night scenes with street lights or interior lamps are normally immune from flare. Chromatic aberration is well controlled as well, with only slight magenta fringing visible on high contrast edges. Mild light falloff is evident wide open at 18mm but disappears when stopped down.IMAGE STABILIZATION: I almost always get a sharp picture, even three stops below my normal hand held shutter speed. I can’t squeeze out four stops unless I brace myself against something. There isn’t a panning switch for IS but it seems to auto-detect panning and compensate accordingly.LENS HOOD: Use a hood to protect this lens from stray light, doggie noses and raindrops. A hood is not included but the Canon EW-73D Lens Hood is available at a cringe worthy 35 shekels. Knockoffs of the EW-73D will eventually appear at a fraction of OEM. Incidentally, I own two other EW-73 series hoods—EW-73C for the 10-18 STM and EW-73B for the EF-s 17-85 IS USM—and they don’t fit the EF-s 18-135 3.5-5.6 IS USM.FINAL BLURB: This is a very good general use APS-C zoom: I love the petite size, zoom range, AF speed/smoothness and sharpness of this lens. Coupled with the 80D, it makes a wonderfully versatile, nimble and lightweight travel combo. I feel confident to shoot in most situations and bring back sharp images and videos.</p>

<h5 id="my-search-is-over">My search is over</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This in my NEW favorite lens. After searching for the right lens for my Canon 80D, I&rsquo;ve found it. I have a full frame camera that I use for business. This will be used for personal. Stills and especially videos. I tried several Canon and Sigma lenses. I decided on this because of the new Nano USM technology. My video&rsquo;s taken with my Shure shotgun Mic. shows this lens to be silent. I also love the new 24mm pancake lens by Canon.</p>

<h5 id="super-versatile-lens">Super Versatile Lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful and versatile lens. Using for a new Canon EOS 80D. I had a first edition of this IS lens for my old venerable Canon Digital Rebel XT, which got a broken edge after a trip down on the pavement (but still continues to work to this day!), but this new lens is even smoother and better. Focus is very sharp and easy, zoom is smooth and quiet. The weight and balance of this lens is good with the EOS 80D body. So far I&rsquo;ve easily captured handheld beautiful sky and sunset photos, portraits, dogs in action, and also close-up flower and knitting project detail shots. Love this lens. Very pleased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-this-lens-only-makes-it-a-better-still-camera">and this lens only makes it a better still camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fabulous lens. Using with a Canon 40D, so cannot take advantage of all the new features the lens offers. But this lens appears to be amazingly sharp, well balanced with the camera body, and exceptionally quiet focus. Though the 40D is a bit dated, it performs well, and this lens only makes it a better still camera. Really nice depth of field capability. The 4-stop image stabilization makes shooting in low light much easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lighting-fast-focusing">Lighting fast focusing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is lightning fast! I could not be more happy with this lens. I&rsquo;ve had problems in the past with lenses that &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; for focus. This lens will focus almost immediately. Plus it&rsquo;s exceptionally good when using it for video. I could not be more stoked on my purchase. I bought this used but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was refurbished. It&rsquo;s also compatible with Canon&rsquo;s soon-to-be-released PZ-E1 power zoom adapter which gives you the power to zoom on a DSLR with the touch of a button ( A first for DSLR if I&rsquo;m not mistaken). I definitely recommend it.</p>
