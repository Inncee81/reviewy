<h5 id="very-pleased-with-these-binoculars">Very pleased with these binoculars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very pleased with these binoculars. First, the packaging was very high quality and a lot of pride went into the packaging design and the presentation of the product to the consumer. The binoculars look good and feel good in the hand and feel like solid, high quality instruments. They are easy to hold and the focus knob is ergonomically designed and very smooth. Before purchasing these, I tried Nikon Monarch 5&rsquo;s, Monarch 7&rsquo;s, Steiner Merlin Pro&rsquo;s, and Vortex Diamondbacks. I compared the Carson&rsquo;s side by side with the Monarch 5 and 7 in a variety of lighting conditions and I felt the Carson&rsquo;s suited my needs best, which is mostly night time viewing. The Monarch 7 was just a tad better overall with a wider field of view and slightly brighter image, but the Monarch 7 had a major problem with severe glare from strong lights when viewing during night time, and with the higher price of the M7, that was the determining factor in returning the M7 and keeping the Carson&rsquo;s. The Carson&rsquo;s do have some glare when viewing strong lights at night, but it was not as severe as the Monarch 7. The accessories that come with the Carson&rsquo;s are also very high quality and once again, a lot of attention and pride went into the design of the bino armor case. I did not go into any detail describing product specs since those are on the product website, I just limited this review to my opinion about the product. I was very happy with these binoculars, especially since I compared them to so many others. Overall a great product and I keep saying this, but it was apparent that Carson takes a lot of pride in their product as evidenced by the overall quality of the packaging, product, and accessories. The price also makes these an awesome value!</p>

<p>I know zip about bins, just that &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything&rdquo; comment I always had up to using these! I&rsquo;m old, have eye problems, and am NOT technical. No problem with these. All you do is use them. I have to adjust to my eyes and will not share them with anyone else&hellip;adjustments are super-quick, but my excuse is &ldquo;my eyes, you know&rdquo; but the truth is I won&rsquo;t give them up! Birds come into focus and I can see their bodies flutter when they sing. I can see the color of their throats! Back up: I can FIND them to see them and the color is so beautiful. These binoculars opened up a whole new hobby for me; I would suggest it for a gift to the grandparent in a family: don&rsquo;t wait for an occasion, just do it now. I sound like I own stock in the company, but for me, you don&rsquo;t have to buy a more expensive pair to have great fun. I repeat: I can see with these; any old pairs around the house that older folks say they&rsquo;ve tried&hellip;well, no comparison. Hey, I don&rsquo;t even how to turn on a cell phone, and I can use these. Shoulder strap is great back-saver and case is wonderful&ndash;very quick and safe for bins. Wow.</p>

<h5 id="punching-above-its-weight-class">Punching above its weight class.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a lot of research, I came across Carson&rsquo;s 3D-ED 10X42 binoculars. I initially intended on purchasing a pair of Nikon monarchs or Bushnell Legend HDs, but after reading testimonials about the tremendous value of these, I decided to give them a try.I&rsquo;m not an optics expert by any means, but I&rsquo;ve looked through expensive glass before. I&rsquo;m familiar with the outstanding quality put out by Leica and Zeiss from experiences with binos owned by friends and family. In my experience and from extensive research, you get what you pay for in the world of optics. That being said, I can only surmise from trying these out that Carson is aggressively trying to increase their market share in the industry. The quality of this product mirrors that of binoculars that can be twice as expensive. To jump right into it, you&rsquo;re getting binoculars with lots of great qualities:-Multi coated lenses-Phase correction-Completely waterproof and nitrogen filled casing to prevent fogging and internal damage.-Generous eye relief (to the uninitiated this means the eye pieces screw out so you can find a &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; spot for the picture)-Excellent field of view at range-HIGH overall build quality-Innovative Bino Armor Deluxe case. I was skeptical, but it&rsquo;s clear a lot of thought went into designing this case. It works like they advertise it to.-Comfortable neck strap and back harness system. I didn&rsquo;t find any other binocular that includes these in this price range.-Included cleaning cloth. This isn&rsquo;t anything more special than what comes with a pair of glasses, but it&rsquo;s still appreciated!-LIFETIME NO NONSENSE WARRANTY. This is huge. Binoculars are expensive and complex tools. One bad drop can result in any pair of glasses requiring repair. It&rsquo;s a great relief knowing that even if I damage these by accident, I&rsquo;ll be covered.The meat and potatoes of this product is the image. I plan to get a lot of use from these for hikes, and to take on vacation to look out at objects from the beach. I haven&rsquo;t put these through the full ringer yet, but the quality can simply be described as fantastic so far. I would describe these as &ldquo;bright&rdquo; optics, meaning that they transmit a lot of light. The image is also sharp throughout. This means that you&rsquo;ll see detail not only centered in your view but also on the edges of the view.I haven&rsquo;t really found any downsides yet. You could argue the lack of lense caps is a problem along with the fact that the case isn&rsquo;t completely sealed from dust. This first issue is mitigated by the Bino Armor Deluxe case, given that the two are designed to be used together. Regarding the latter issue, this is easily solved by a ziploc bag when it&rsquo;s on your shelf.BOTTOM LINE:If you&rsquo;re looking in this price range, you&rsquo;d be crazy not to have these on your short list.If you&rsquo;re looking at more expensive pairs in the sub $1000 range, you&rsquo;d also be crazy not to entertain the idea of these.Hope this helps!</p>

<h5 id="unbelievable-quality-for-the-relatively-inexpensive-price">unbelievable quality for the relatively inexpensive price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these CARSON binoculars are absolutely one of the best values regarding high-end optics. i ordered the 50mm pair almost a year ago, about 1week after spring turkeys season began, &amp; have not regretted my purchase for a second. the image / color contrast through my pair of CARSON are on parole better than 2 other higher-priced binoculars that i paid 2x &amp; 3x the price for. i&rsquo;ve since sold both other name-brand pair back in October before our whitetail season began in order to help finance a new rifle scope. buy these &amp; you will not be disappointed. they are extremely rugged, are well packaged, both a neck strap &amp; harness are included &amp; the company stands behind their products with a top-notch warranty. in my opinion the only thing missing from the package are eyepiece &amp; objective covers. i&rsquo;d love to see these guys produce a rifle scope or any type of gun-mounted hunting optic for that matter. highly-recommended optic!!</p>

<p>These are a great value, I could not be happier with them. I looked at the vortex viper HDs and I would say that these are in the same league but at a lower price point.</p>
