<h5 id="love-it-got-it-quick">love it! got it quick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love it! got it quick&hellip;feels solid and sounds great!!! i charged it first per instructions&hellip;then rocked it out in my backyard for a few hours&hellip;i plugged in my ipod in the aux with the provided cord&hellip; then later used my phone and easily synced up blue tooth&hellip;im happy with my purchase !!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="incredible-sound-from-this-speaker">Incredible sound from this speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This may be my favorite purchase from Amazon to date. I cannot say enough about this beautiful, well designed Bluetooth speaker. I&rsquo;ve bought high end models that cost a small fortune and they didn&rsquo;t come close to to clarity of sound this provides. I seriously cannot believe how fantastic this is. It&rsquo;s awesome that it allows you to listen to FM stations as well. Plus you can charge your phone using the speaker. Pairing the speaker with any Bluetooth enabled devices is a total breeze, not like some of the other ones I&rsquo;ve owned. It took like 10 seconds, if that. The wood finish makes this much more attractive and stands out more than the usual black, plastic models. This speaker will get a lot of use over the summer between the shore and BBQ&rsquo;s. At this insanely low price point, I would recommend this to everyone who&rsquo;s on the fence about buying a speaker. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-vintage-dual-speaker-bluetooth-and-charger">Beautiful vintage dual speaker Bluetooth and charger!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough about this speaker. It looks great and works even better! I love the vintage look of it. It&rsquo;s a 10W Bluetooth Speaker with dual speakers. What I didn&rsquo;t realize until I actually got it is that&rsquo;s a power bank as well&hellip;.I can use it to charge my phone if I need to. And I can still play music while I&rsquo;m charging it!! It also has an FM Radio built in! It supports radio/USB charging output slot/ AUX- in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This speaker sounds great! The box itself has nice acoustics especially for $40! I think the speakers are 3&rdquo;, and combined with the box material and resonance, it sounds very naturally bassy. Super pleased</p>
