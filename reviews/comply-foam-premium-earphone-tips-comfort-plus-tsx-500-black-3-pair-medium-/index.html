<h5 id="don-t-listen-to-the-negative-reviews-these-are-perfect">Don&rsquo;t listen to the negative reviews, these are perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to say, that the negative reviews or the reviews showing that they are breaking really upset me!1) it clearly shows that the people claiming that they break easily did NOT take the time to read the instructions, and I am more than sure that they bought the wrong size for their ears, you may think your ears are large, but chances are they are medium. So if you find yourself forcing them in your ear then you bought them to big for your ear. Also, in the instructions it clearly states to squeeze the ear tips down and then place them in your ear as your body heat will help the tips seal your ears.2) make sure that you know what you are buying! Also make sure that they will fit your earphones first, they do not fit every earphone on the market, go to the website and see if the earphones you have are on their list.I bought these for my Samsung iconX earphones and they fit amazing. They made them sound 100 times better than their weak tips that come with the earphones. The bass doubled and the clarity was amazing.Now, these ear tips will completely blockout outside sound, so I would not use these to ride a bike in the street, but that&rsquo;s just me.I wore them all day and they did not bother me once.Now, for me when it comes to the iconX, I have to remove the tips before placing them in the charger because they will not charge with these still on the earphones.Since this is a pack of 3, I used another set on my Samsung Level wired earphones and they once again made a major difference in sound, the levels come with foam tips, which made the earphones sound better then the silicone ones, but when I removed the stock foam tips and used these it was a major difference in bass.I&rsquo;m 6 foot 4, with what I thought were large ears, but it turned out that I needed the medium, so when buying these make sure you get the right size for your ears, especially before leaving a negative review.I live in NYC and these are perfect for the subway, because even with the loud thunderous sounding trains I am only able to hear the music.Only negative is when someone stops you to ask for directions you have to take the earphone out of one of your ear to hear what the person is saying&hellip;.lolThese tips are amazing and if you care for sound, these are a must for an ear tip upgrade.</p>

<h5 id="lasts-a-month-before-they-split-apart">Lasts a month before they split apart</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These ear buds keep tearing very easily, they last a month and break apart even though they are stored in a cased and barely used the durability is a major downside considering the cost. They feel good for a short time until they break apart. I like the feel, but they should last longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="astonishing-game-changing-audio-fidelity-for-in-ear-headphones">Astonishing, game-changing audio fidelity for in-ear headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I felt compelled to write a review on Amazon. I buy a few hundred items a year on their marketplace, yet my last review had to have been written years ago.I bought a pair of Powerbeats2 Wireless about 7 months ago. Flying a few times a week for work, the appeal of Bluetooth headphones outweighed my concern about audio quality. And while the Powerbeats2 are great in many respects, audio fidelity (and depth of frequency response) has always left me underwhelmed.But having lost one or two of the silicone ear tips that ship with the Beats, I decided to find additional ear tips. I finally &ldquo;settled&rdquo; on the Comply Comfort Plus, uncertain of the foam and not even thinking about additional benefits. And now I&rsquo;m regretting not doing this 7 months ago.If Beats were smart, they would OEM these with every new pair of in-ear headphones they sell. The depth of bass I now here at mid-volume is nothing less than night-and-day from where I was yesterday. I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve ever heard such low frequencies from headphones that weren&rsquo;t over-the-ear. Mid-range and treble are equally clear.The fit is also fantastic. The memory foam is, as the product line would suggest, quite comfortable. Can&rsquo;t speak to how it will hold up under active wear, but we&rsquo;ll worry about that when I actually start working out again some day.Full disclaimer: I&rsquo;ve only been wearing them for about 20 minutes. Quite the testament to how affected I was by the effect (grammar, ladies and gentlemen!) of the new tips, but also a caution that I haven&rsquo;t had enough time to reinforce these opinions with evidence. Will post an update in a few weeks after they get some good use.</p>

<h5 id="overpriced-and-fragile-but-the-only-tips-that-work-for-my-jay-birds">Overpriced and fragile but the only tips that work for my Jay Birds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overpriced and they wear out after a few weeks of use. But they are the only earbuds I can use with my Jay Bird&rsquo;s Bluebud X headset and hear my podcasts while cycling, with wind roar completely blocked.Installation of these tips onto the headset posts is a very tight fit but it can be achieved. Roll the tip into an oval and &ldquo;screw&rdquo; it onto the Bluebud&rsquo;s post, making sure to get it all the way to the base of the post.These &ldquo;Comfort PLUS&rdquo; units cost even more than the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; ones but are easier to live with.Mediums work for me. They&rsquo;re tight to get into your ear. I pinch and moisten each tip just a little using my lips, then &ldquo;screw&rdquo; it into my ear.Because they&rsquo;re basically foam rubber, these tips self-destruct in normal use. Inserting them and wearing them breaks down the foam over time &ndash; and not much time. A set will last me a few weeks, maybe 20 wearings. That&rsquo;s more than $1 every time I use them.I never thought I&rsquo;d willingly pay for tips this expensive, but the ones provided with my headset do not seal out wind noise and pop out withing minutes of insertion, no matter what size I use. So I&rsquo;m stuck with these Complys.</p>
