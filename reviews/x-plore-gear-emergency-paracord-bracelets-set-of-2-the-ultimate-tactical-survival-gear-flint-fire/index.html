<h5 id="too-bad-they-don-t-allow-half-stars-cause-this-is-really">too bad they don&rsquo;t allow half stars cause this is really &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>too bad they don&rsquo;t allow half stars cause this is really a 3.5 star for me due to sizing information. the photo chart is a good start, but keep in mind the buckle has components on it that make it a little longer than most. buckles dont bend so the &ldquo;circle&rdquo; measurement of your wrist is misleading. example: my wrist measures just a little under 8&rdquo;, so I went with medium. if you like a tight watchband this will probably be fine for you. I like some looseness and the longer buckle takes out the looseness slack and makes it nearly impossible to turn it once on the wrist. so measure your wrist and go with the length that is close if you like snug or go a size up if you like loose. if you have a really big wrist take the buckle off and weave your own that&rsquo;s bigger.as for the bracelet itself it&rsquo;s pretty good. the whistle and compass are decent. whisltle is fairly loud unless your lips cover the hole too much, that&rsquo;s operator error. the fire striker was my main goal and works well. for those expecting perfection out of the box, you don&rsquo;t get it with ferrite rods. all ferrite rods come with a &ldquo;paint&rdquo; like coating on them, so until you scrape past that you likely wont&rsquo; get much of anything. keep trying. once your past the paint there is plenty of very hot sparks to ignite TINDER. if you think sparks will set a small stick on fire by itself you should limit your camping to a hotel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-had-never-seen-anything-like-this-before">i had never seen anything like this before</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was trying to find something different to get with my gift card. I certainly found that in the paracord bracelets, i had never seen anything like this before. I have not had a chance to start a fire yet. Tried the whistle, holy hoots Batman, quite loud and i really didn&rsquo;t give it a full breath.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="way-better-than-expected">Way better than expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For this price I thought these things would never fit and I would have to give them away. I am on the bigger side, well I&rsquo;m pretty much just fat (6-2 285 pounds with big wrists) but these fit great and actually leave me some comfortable room so it&rsquo;s not tight on my wrist. I really like them. They are my first bracelets like this as I am trying to become more of an outdoors person. But they are stylish enough to wear as an accessory. You simply cannot beat this deal. Well made. Good fit as advertised</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-small-wrists-just-under-8-inches">I have small wrists, just under 8 inches. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have small wrists, just under 8 inches. The medium bracelet fit OK (a bit loose). My main complaint is how big and bulky the buckle is. Feels uncomfortable and for someone who uses their hands a lot (not sitting at a computer) this will definitely get in the way. I know a lot of this is preference but may be valuable if you can relate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="paracord-bracelet">Paracord Bracelet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bracelet seems to be well constructed. The paracord is woven tightly, the clasp locks in tight and secure, then it releases easily, the cutting blade is secure and below the surface so it doesn&rsquo;t catch on anything and the compass seems to be working fine. All in all a very good bracelet only time will tell if it holds up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stars-even-though-i-returned-it-as-some-give-bad-reviews-for-simple-fit-issues">&hellip; stars even though I returned it as some give bad reviews for simple fit issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I give this 4 stars even though I returned it as some give bad reviews for simple fit issues. This medium is quite tight on my less than 7.5 inch wrist, the Medium should have fit 7.5-8 inch wrist. The compass seamed to work and the whistle worked just fine. I would have kept them if they fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-only-received-one">GOOD but only received ONE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the bracelet is fine and all even though it fit a little big. Im just upset that i only received one of them and not but i cant do anything because i cannot contact the seller</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="compass-discrepancy">Compass discrepancy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found it interesting that the two bracelets showed different readings on the compass for point north. Other than that they are great, exactly as described by the seller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-buckle-is-a-bit-awkward-since-it-s-large-so">The buckle is a bit awkward since it&rsquo;s large so &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The buckle is a bit awkward since it&rsquo;s large so I needed a bigger size. I don&rsquo;t have large wrists so I figured the medium would fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it did not fit my rist</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fire starter not good quality .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really nice. I will have to update after I see how our grandsons like them&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="compass-doesn-t-work-everything-else-about-this-is-as">Compass doesn&rsquo;t work. Everything else about this is &ldquo;as &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Compass doesn&rsquo;t work. Everything else about this is &ldquo;as advertised&rdquo; but the compass is worthless. It points over 90 degree to the east of where it should.</p>
