<h5 id="you-might-want-to-wait-for-the-price-to-drop-but-you-won-t-be-sorry">You might want to wait for the price to drop, but you won&rsquo;t be sorry!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this TV last week locally (Sorry Amazon) after considering the previous 9000 series (UN65HU9000FXZA) for the past couple of months. Is this TV worth $1,500 more than the previous version? (as of this writing in early April, 2015 this model is selling everywhere for $4,999). Probably not, but hey, if you can afford it and you are an early adopter like me, go for it. The picture quality is outstanding! This television is noticeably brighter than the previous model in the head to head,in-store comparisons I did. Some reviewers have complained about reflections on the shiny curved screen. Although this model has the same surface finish, I haven&rsquo;t noted any major problems with reflections. This TV is plenty bright enough despite being in a family room with lots of big windows and skylights. The colors are extremely vivid and the depth enhancement function is pretty wild as well. As several others have discussed with the previous model, you&rsquo;ll need to experiment with settings. I&rsquo;d note that I didn&rsquo;t like the Movie mode that some reviewers on Amazon recommend.The only complaint I have with it is that the Smart Hub doesn&rsquo;t include Netflix, which by the way, is about the only source of 4-K programming.at this point. The one connect box has enough (4) HDMI inputs, so I solved that problem with my AppleTV, but it would have been nice for Samsung to build Netflix into the system. Maybe with the next firmware update.Setup was easy, right out of the box. All-in all, you&rsquo;ll love this TV.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-wonderful-glorious-tv">Fantastic, wonderful, glorious TV.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I upgraded my triple monitor setup (1 x 24&rdquo; and 2 x 23&rdquo; LCDs) to this display. Fullscreen 4K PC gaming is amazing. The colors are amazingly vivid, the brightness is superb. This was also my first smart TV, and I&rsquo;m sure those features are relatively standard, but I was still impressed by it. I used to run a projector for my computer gaming (~9.5&rsquo; diagonal display) and thought that I was Futureman from that&hellip;but damn, this display knocks that out of the park.One downside is that it appears that Samsung relegated the user interfacing drivers to the individual smart TV app makers. What I mean by this is that I could connect a USB keyboard to the breakout/source box (how have we lived so long with TVs without having these things as standard?! Truly revolutionary piece of port donglin&rsquo;) and the Netflix app picked it up right away. I can use the keyboard to get connected to my account, search for content, do whatever by typing into the keyboard like one would expect. But the Amazon Video app only sees the standard USB keyboard as a set of arrow keys and an enter button. It refuses to see the alphanumeric keys as what they are. Very frustrating to have such a different experience between apps when the hardware layer should be handled by the operating system itself. One could say that this isn&rsquo;t as much a slight against Samsung and more against the Amazon Video app team, but honestly, basic drivers like this should be uniform and the app makers should just have to hook into the API. Layers of abstraction people&hellip;basic concepts.If you&rsquo;re considering a huge display like this, make sure you get yourself a great wall-mount kit as well. I got this one ECHOGEAR Full Motion Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for most 37-70 inch LED, LCD, OLED and Plasma Flat Screen TVs w/ VESA patterns up to 600 x 400 - 16&rdquo; Extension - EGLF1-BK. Works very well. With two people had it installed in less than an hour. All of the pieces you need are in the kit and comes with the TV.</p>

<h5 id="just-buy-it-already">Just Buy it Already&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as the perfect television. I researched and viewed this set along with others for six months. I&rsquo;m so glad I waited because it had a temporary price decrease on November 1st. The set is amazing and the picture is simply beautiful. I&rsquo;m still fine tuning some of the settings until I&rsquo;m completely satisfied with the picture. It&rsquo;s fun to play with the remote, once you learn how to operate it. It&rsquo;s incredibly fast and accurate. The sound is very good for a television, I still prefer my home theater system for movies and sports. There are so many features on this model that it will take a few more months to learn and enjoy all it has to offer. There are always going to be negative reviews and bad experiences with any electronic items on the market. I waited to review this item for just that reason. I can tell you just from my personal experience that it&rsquo;s the best electronic purchase I&rsquo;ve ever made. I&rsquo;m very picky and price conscience, so at $1,999.00 it was a great buy. I&rsquo;m sure the price will drop again when the 2016 models come out. As for the Amazon delivery, I only had one man show up, very late in the day to bring it in by himself. I was not happy after waiting for 10 hours for him to show up. I give him 5 stars for his professional attitude and helping me put it on my Z-line tv stand, then hooking up the power and box to make sure it worked before he left. He cleaned up all the packing materials and left my living room free of any mess. Glad I purchased from Amazon instead of Best-Worst Buy. I couldn&rsquo;t get anyone to even help me there. Another reason I purchased from Amazon, great customer service. Thanks!</p>

<p>I wanted a great tv that was 4k and did 3d. This tv does both great. I am glad that I got a model that was made prior to the 2016 models, Samsung does not support 3d anymore, oh well. The tv renders a beautiful picture, it stays connected to the internet well, I have not had any problems with my set.</p>
