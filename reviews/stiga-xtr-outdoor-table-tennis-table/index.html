</ul>

<p>Skip the stress of rearranging furniture to fit a table tennis table inside your home and enjoy table tennis outdoors. The STIGA XTR Outdoor table is designed and manufactured with durable, all-weather materials such as aluminum, exterior grade powder coating, and galvanized steel for a table that is waterproof, rust-free, and resistant to sun damage, making it perfect for year round outdoor storage in any climate. This table comes 95% preassembled with only one simple step to complete so you can begin playing in less than 10 minutes. The 6mm aluminum/composite top is supported by a stout 1.5” tubular steel apron to deliver lively and even bounce across the entire surface and resists warping under any condition. The table includes a 72” exterior grade net and post set with string tension adjustment for excellent playability. Below the table, sturdy 1.25” welded steel legs include a self-opening feature so they automatically deploy when opening or folding the table halves for added convenience and safety. The legs also include adjustable height leg levelers to ensure your table has a solid, level playing surface on any terrain. For added flexibility and mobility, the table features 3” ball-bearing wheels that smoothly roll and lock into place for safety. This table includes playback mode for individual practice and each table half can be separated and used as a free-standing multi-purpose table for dining, playing cards, and more. After playing, conveniently fold each table half into the upright position, lock into place with the red safety latch, and roll to the desired location for convenient storage. The separate table halves of the XTR nest together for an ultra-compact folded profile so it can fit into any space.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="high-gloss-top-means-glare-from-sun-or-bright-sky">High gloss top means glare from sun or bright sky.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have only had the table a few days but have played a bunch of games already. First impressions: Box had one gouge in it which led to a small scratch on the surface, but close to the net and not bad enough to reject the table. Easy to assemble in about 30 minutes. All the pieces were there with the correct quantity of assembly hardware. Top is much thinner than expected and definitely has a different sound when playing than the wood table this one replaced, but not a problem. The blue table top is really attractive but the high gloss finish definitely creates a substantial glare, since we are using the table in a covered area outside, The glare is bad enough that it does create a visual problem for the players. I plan to contact the manufacturer to see if they can suggest a remedy. Out of curiosity, we are going to conduct a &lsquo;bounce test&rsquo; on the new metal covered table versus the table we replaced that has a three quarter inch wood top. Last &lsquo;first impression&rsquo; is the metal top with whatever is coating it creating the glossy finish doesn&rsquo;t seem to take, contribute to, or accept the spin a player might intentionally put on the ball. (new glossy metal top versus previous wood top a flat green color)</p>

<h5 id="stiga-table-happy-with-the-purchase">Stiga table! Happy with the purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this table a few days ago. I am extremely happy with the shipping of the table. They take extreme care in packaging the table to prevent any damage. Their are reinforced corner protectors, hard cardboard, and additional packaging to prevent any damage. Amazon shipping was great and they were right on time with a call ahead to inform me they would be there shortly. The table definitely plays differently then a wood table but after a few hits on it you are used to it. It really did come 95% together. You only have to assemble the four leg rollers and you are ready to play. It took me 20 minutes and it was set up. I love how it folds together and locks in place. I am happy with the product. It will be staying in a 3 season room so I opted for the outdoor table to prevent any damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-table-for-outdoor-use">Decent table for outdoor use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product was promptly delivered on the day and within the time window. The package was delivered without any damage. Assembly is easy even though the instruction was very detailed. There was a small bulge on one side, but it would not affect the playing too much. It was apparently damaged at the factory, as there is some ding and scratch underneath the bulge. It should have been rejected or repaired at the plant before packaging it (made and packed in China). Playing characteristics is as expected for an outdoor table with thin metallic top plate. Top coat and paint job for the white lines look good. Can&rsquo;t say anything about the durability of the table as I assembled it yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-table">Great table</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great table, extremely easy assembly took about 10 min out of the box. Quality of the table is excellent, looks like it will stand up to the outdoor elements. Playable was awesome the ping pong balls had a true bounce. Easy to fold up and sturdy to move. We had purchased another cheaper table and took my husband <sup>41</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours for assembly and didn&rsquo;t stand up to moving or playing on the table.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-set-up-to-play">Easy set up to play</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple assembly (15 min). Easy set up to play, although since it is in two separate pieces you need to make sure your ground surface is flat or the halves wont match up. Good playability, not quite as lively as my Stiga indoor table, but close. Compact and easy storage. So far, it was a great purchase. Time will tell if it is as durable as advertised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-love-it">Absolutely love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great table. Hubby completely assembled in about 30 minutes by himself. Could have done it quicker but in no hurry. Very well made. Looks great. Plays as well as any table I have ever used. Had family over the past weekend and everyone loved playing. Some had not done so in 20 years. Should have made this purchase years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-with-a-little-concern">Good with a little concern</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made, and instructions were easy. I wish there was more ability to adjust/level out the tables besides just the two legs on either side. We set this up on an outdoor patio with slightly uneven stone and it&rsquo;s been hard to get the halves to align. I feel good about the durability of the table, but not so sure how well the netting and net clamps will hold up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun">FUN!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love, love, love our new STIGA XTR outdoor table tennis table! I love the table&rsquo;s blue surface color; very attractive. The table is exactly as advertised. Took only about 20 min. for two non-mechanical ladies to unpack, attach the wheels, flip it over, attach the net, and start having family fun. It&rsquo;s very good quality, and super easy to fold up and wheel to the side for storage. I also bought the STIGA paddles &amp; balls, as well as the storage cover. There was a little hiccup with the delivery date, but Amazon stepped in and made everything right. Extremely satisfied and happy.</p>
