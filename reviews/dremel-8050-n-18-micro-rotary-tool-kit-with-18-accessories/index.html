<p>Style:Rotary tool
With surprising power that lets you cut metal with ease, the Dremel Micro is the perfect combination of size, ergonomics and power that make it the ultimate tool for both precise and light duty DIY tasks. Designed to be held between the thumb and forefinger like a pencil, the Dremel Micro allows a grip that is close to the work-piece for superior maneuverability and control. The Dremel Micro is powered by an integrated high capacity 8V lithium-ion battery for longer run time with no memory effect. Optimal speed control on the Dremel Micro is especially user-friendly. The speed is adjusted in five stages from 5,000 to 25,000 rpm by using two buttons on the top of the tool, which enables it to be adapted to each application. A five-stage LED scale makes it quick and easy to see which speed is currently set. To illuminate projects, the Dremel Micro has LED lights built uniquely into the nose cap to aid in vision and accuracy. The brilliantly powerful Dremel Micro features lights that indicate battery level, lithium ion battery technology, and a docking station that automatically stops charging when the batteries have reached capacity.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-trimming-dogs-nails-pinewood-derby-and-intricate-work-not-for-heavy-duty-cutting-grinding-or-sanding">Perfect for trimming dogs nails, pinewood derby and intricate work, not for heavy duty cutting, grinding or sanding</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this Dremel 8050 to trim our puppy&rsquo;s nails since he fussed so much when I tried to use clippers. I use 120 grit sandpaper drums and use about 10k rpm. It is fairly quiet and does the job very well, quick and efficiently . We trim his nail weekly. He has now gotten used to it. I have never owned dremel before, so I started using this micro around the home and quickly realized it does not have the power needed to cut wood or metal other than very thin pieces. Anything more than that and the motor will shut off. I recently changed some toilet bolts and it did cut through them but it took several restarts to cut them through. If I put any pressure on the dremel, it would turn off.Some pros about this model are:1. Very lightweight and maneuverable2. LED light allows you to illuminate what you are doing3. Variable speeds from 5 to 28k. (starts at 15k when you turn on)4. Lithium ion battery technology- 8 voltIf you are going to use this for trimming dogs nails and light projects, this 8050 is probably the dremel for you. I wanted more power for other projects and also bought an 8220 which is a larger, heavier 12 volt model. I have pictured them both here for size comparison and will write a separate review for the 8220.</p>

<h5 id="love-it-light-weight-makes-it-so-much-easier">LOVE IT! Light weight makes it so much easier &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for buffing/grinding dogs nails, for I am a Dog Groomer. LOVE IT! Light weight makes it so much easier to use than a huge, bulky, corded dremel. I love the 5 speed settings! For dogs that get scared of that &ldquo;Dremel noise&rdquo; I put it on the lowest setting, bearly any noise at all! (Even on some of the higher settings, it&rsquo;s still much more quiet than a regular corded dremel). Once you go wireless, you won&rsquo;t want to go back. Another amazing feature is the fact that the stand charges the dremel. When I&rsquo;m not using it, but it back on the stand and let it charge back up. Never again do I have to stop a nail trim to change out my battery. Just get this dremel, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-had-to-send-first-back">Good but had to send first back</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had some problems with the first one I orderd and will be sending back. Even so I ordered 2 more so not to be without one while I send it back. The charger was not working well. The Light is very useful. I have the other lithium battery ones also which work better but do not have the light.I have probably ordered over 20 dremels over the years. I hope they improve on this one but as is it is really good</p>

<h5 id="love-this-awesome-little-dremel">Love this awesome little dremel!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with this product. I highly suggest grabbing one. It&rsquo;s powerful, lasts a long time, and is quiet, or quieter cpmpared to most other dremels. I currently have a corded 300 model (can&rsquo;t remember actual model atm) and this little feel is just as powerful on half the rotations. I am a groomers assistant and I can use this all day or small to large dog&rsquo;s nails. The bright led light is a massive plus and the fact that it auromatically stops if hair gets caught is awesome. I will actually get another one for home when I do artwork in the near future.</p>

<h5 id="5-star-if-it-were-not-for-flimsy-fit-in-charging-base">5 star if it were not for flimsy fit in charging base</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a heavier duty nail grinder for my grooming area. I like that I can change the speed. it is quieter than most, so some dogs don&rsquo;t freak at the noise. I just find the recharging base a bit flimsy to use. The recharging elements don&rsquo;t sit tightly enough and sometimes I come in and find it is not recharged completely. I&rsquo;ve taken to taping it in place. It&rsquo; is the only reason it is not a 5 star.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-size-works-great-for-dog-nails">Love the size works great for dog nails!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the pet dremel and the 3000 corded version as well. I needed something strong enough for 5 dogs two of which are Dobermans. This is so much easier to hold and use with ease! I had my mind set on the Micro after I tried using the shaft extension on my 3000 that made it smaller to hold. In the end all the cords and everything still bugged me. Most cordless dremels don&rsquo;t seem to have enough power or last too long. I was going to buy the 7300 which a lot of people I know used, but in the end settled on this one and really like it. My husband who has had the 3000 for years never touches it, but soon as I got the micro in he has used it on several projects already.UPDATE: When I bought this Amazon sellers were selling it for $500 so I went to another site that is just as good. Anyways after 2 months my Dremel died! I tried taking the charging cord from the base and plugging it back in numerous times. Switched outlets trying to see if that was the cause, and changing charging cords without another brand as well. When I sent it in to Dremel they said it was one of their recalled models. When they received it and charged it.. it started working again. I am used to troubleshooting issues so I know I checked it up and down on my end. Dremel couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on and doesn&rsquo;t open their products up to check the components. They sent me a replacement with no problems so I wouldn&rsquo;t run into the issue again. Very happy with their customer service! Great product backed by great service!</p>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this at the recommendation of a groomer friend of mine to use on my dog&rsquo;s toenails. I have been using a similar product for years that was specifically marketed for animals but this product is far superior. I really like the adjustable speed level which I can adjust for each dog&rsquo;s toenail size and length. This unit also has a backlight which is amazing! It came with a number of accessories and bands. I am very pleased and will be getting rid of my old grinder for good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dog-grooming-essential">Dog Grooming Essential</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like so many others here, I bought the Dremel as a last resort to manage my fussy dog&rsquo;s talons, because a) I am very squeamish using the plier-style trimmers after I once cut into the nib and sent him wailing and bleeding, and b) he&rsquo;s a fusspot at the best of times and hates pawicure almost as much as he hates vacuum cleaners. So two days ago I sat down with him, all easy and a bag of treats nearby and started gently with the drum sanding unit. He didn&rsquo;t even flinch!! The machine runs very quiet, the light source at the top is extremely helpful and great to see exactly what you&rsquo;re doing and it works much faster than I thought it would. Overall it&rsquo;s one of those purchases where you say: I should have bought that years ago&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-tool-i-use-it-for-dog-toenails-and">This is a great tool! I use it for dog toenails and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great tool! I use it for dog toenails and its the best one i have ever used. The lighted end feature is hugely helpful and it charges fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solved-none-of-the-included-accessories-fit-the-dremel">Solved!!! none of the included accessories fit the dremel.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edited to add: I called the Dremel help line and a super nice woman walked me through getting the collet nut to fit my accessories!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This dreamer is awesome. Much better than the previous model where the battery just never sat right.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-in-a-month">Dead in a month.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this not even a month ago and it&rsquo;s already not working, a friend of mine put hers on my charger and the charger worked but mine refuses to charge. It&rsquo;s completely DEAD!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-love-love-it">Love love love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this Drexel. I have owned many of the rechargeable ones but this is by far the best. Different speeds and the light. The light is the best thing about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keep-looking-for-one-that-works">Keep looking for one that works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it to maintain my dog&rsquo;s nails once right after it arrived. No problems. I picked it up last night to use it again and it&rsquo;s dead. It won&rsquo;t charge or turn on at all.</p>

<p>I bought 3 of them</p>

<h5 id="great-for-nail-grinding">Great for nail grinding</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m a dog bather and this is absolutely perfect for nail grinding! The longest I&rsquo;ve done without charging is 2 days but I&rsquo;m sure it could last longer I will test it out soon to&hellip;</p>
