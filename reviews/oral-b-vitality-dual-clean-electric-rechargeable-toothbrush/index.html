<h5 id="my-teeth-feel-very-clean">My teeth feel very clean.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this toothbrush based on my dentist&rsquo;s recommendation. I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a pretty decent brusher, but I do have some sensitivity and a small cavity every year or two. My dentist recommended this electric toothbrush as something that would improve my oral health without breaking the bank (since I didn&rsquo;t need THAT much help).Pros:- My teeth feel SO much cleaner. I didn&rsquo;t realize just how much so until, after a month or so of using this, I decided to use a regular ol&rsquo; toothbrush while traveling and my teeth felt gross by comparison.- I think my teeth have even gotten a little whiter.- The brush head is big enough to cover a decent amount of ground, but small enough to fit in my tiny mouth. (I can only use &ldquo;compact&rdquo; size manual toothbrushes.)- The 2-minute timer is really handy.- I was a little worried about its ability to clean around my permanent bottom retainer, but it does a great job.- Holds a charge for several days.Room for improvement:- I wish that there was a one minute timer as well, so that I knew I was brushing the top and bottom teeth for the same amount of time.- The timer is a pulse of the brushes, not a beep. It awkwardly interrupts my brushing; I&rsquo;d prefer a beep.- I would like a &ldquo;charging&rdquo; light so that I know the charger is working and, more importantly, when it&rsquo;s done charging.- The toothbrush&rsquo;s action gets less intense as the charge wears off. I would rather that it stayed at full power the whole time, until the battery was out and then it just shut off.Despite the room for improvement, I do recognize that this is on the lower end of the price range and so am not counting those things against it in my rating. I feel like it does a really good job at cleaning my teeth, and that&rsquo;s what I bought it for.Update after a dental checkup: I had almost zero buildup, and my gums didn&rsquo;t bleed at all! Definitely an improvement over before switching to this toothbrush.</p>

<h5 id="best-brush-for-the-price-the-packaging-is-tough-though">Best brush for the price. The packaging is tough though.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great toothbrush for the price. Of course you can get better brushes, but they also cost much, much more.First few times you use it, you&rsquo;ll feel post-dentist clean, but you&rsquo;ll soon get used to it and anything less will feel dirty.The timer feature helps you make sure you&rsquo;re brushing for long enough. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t finish by the time it buzzes, so I just keep brushing for a bit longer.It comes with a replacement head, and a nice little charger. I can use it about a week between charges.A minor concern is some water/toothpaste get under the toothbrush head, and onto the arm that moves the head/bristles; I try to air that out often, for fear of the mold growth that plagues certain toothbrushes.My one major gripe is the packaging is difficult to get through. It&rsquo;s efficiently and aesthetically packaged, but at the cost of convenience in opening it. However, it&rsquo;s not a big enough deal for me to dock a star. Maybe someday there will be a frustration free packaging option for this.</p>

<h5 id="does-a-great-job-cleaning">Does a GREAT job cleaning!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my husband who has recently been diagnosed with periodontal disease. His periodontist recommended he use an electronic toothbrush twice daily to maintain plaque buildup and keep his gums in check. He had a different model, or brand (can&rsquo;t remember which) but it was lost along with a bag and all of it&rsquo;s other contents during a recent business travel trip by the wonderful airport shuttle service :&lt; I thought he paid quite a bit more for his last one than this one costs, but I thought I&rsquo;d try this one because it was inexpensive and had decent reviews. My husband LOVES it. He says it works better than his last one did, and it gives him a very good cleaning. After using it, he feels like he&rsquo;s just been worked over by the hygienist. I like how there are different types of heads you can get and they are all compatible with this brush. The price is very well worth it. He&rsquo;s only been using it for a few weeks now so I can&rsquo;t speak to the battery usage or overall product life. Hopefully it will last a while, but even if if dies in a year, I&rsquo;d still buy another one. The price is worth how well this unit performs.</p>

<h5 id="best-toothbrush-i-have-ever-had">Best Toothbrush I Have Ever Had&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely, positively LOVE LOVE LOVE this toothbrush.I had been using the Spinbrush Pros for a while before I decided to look for rechargeable brushes. The number 1 issue I had with the Spinbrush was water getting inside the brush and damaging the place where the batteries were so I would have to go and buy a new Spinbrush every 10 months or so. My friend told me that she had been using an Oral-B rechargeable brush so I decided to check this out.Honestly, I was skeptical at first. I read almost all of the reviews for this brush, good and bad, just to make sure I was not paying too much for something that was not going to last me very long. I finally decided to get the brush when the Spinbrush I was using at the time died.The package was easy to open and it comes with a spare head. I plugged my brush into charge the day I got it and followed the directions before I used it for the first time. When I finally got to brush my teeth, I was so surprised that it was easy to use and guess what? No batteries! Water doesn&rsquo;t get in because it&rsquo;s water tight and it charges by just placing the toothbrush on a charging station. I&rsquo;ve used this brush for a few months now and my teeth have never been cleaner. The only downside is that the brush heads are a little expensive, but I guess the way to getting around it would be to buy a generic brand of brush heads.Overall, best electric toothbrush you could ever buy!</p>

<h5 id="as-advertised">As advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Without question, this $25 product beats all of the others, that I&rsquo;ve tried. No bells and whistles, just a lot of power, in a compact toothbrush. Also, the charging stand is really small, so it takes up almost no space, on the counter. In addition, I really like the dual-action brush head that comes with the product, because it has a circular brush, as well as a triangular one, that is designed to mimic flossing. After two minutes, the brush head pulsates a few times, and then goes back to full speed. Coupled with mouthwash, it really does provide that feeling you get, when you leave the dentist.</p>
