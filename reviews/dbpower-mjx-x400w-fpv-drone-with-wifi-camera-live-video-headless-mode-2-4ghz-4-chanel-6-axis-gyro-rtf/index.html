<h5 id="this-is-a-wonderful-quad-my-first-flight-out-was-with-a">This is a wonderful Quad. My first flight out was with a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a wonderful Quad. My first flight out was with a 7mph wind. I did have to fight the wind a bit but the drone was able to keep up with no problem. I want to say a few things about the manual and a few other things I noticed too to help you out.To start out, of course this drone takes some assembly but not to much. The screwdriver is supplied which is nice. Extra blades are also included and it comes with 4 already installed. BE careful not to open the spare blades parts bag and lose the 4 tiny screws in there. They are not bagged in a zip lock and can easily fall out. It was nice to see them included! You will have to install the blade guards. The screws are tiny watch for those in the bag too. They do not want to go in easy so take your time and eventually you will get them in. After the guards are put on your drone becomes 15 inches across. Without the guards its a 10 &ldquo; span. The propellers are 5 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &rdquo; long. They are completely white. I would like to have seen some color variation on them but I guess you can always get creative and paint them. The bird is nearly all white with the exception of a few small decals.This does come with a battery. It is a little hard to get in.You will find it installed but not plugged in. There is a small screw that holds the battery door shut, but I have found it is easier just to leave the screw out as the door stays tightly closed on its own. You will probably lose it in the field when changing batteries anyway.They also give you a USB charger device. You can&rsquo;t see the light built into the USB that plugs into your computer or charging device but trust me when the battery is charged it will light up.You will have to install the landing gear it just snaps in 4 holes on each side. Make sure the long part of the gear faces the nose of the quad when installing. There is also a black piece attached to one of the landing gear and you need to carefully push in the antenna here. Most people that have flown drones know how to pair the controller with the drone but the manual makes it seem like this will be automatic. Its not. The normal up and down on the throttle will pair it and you will get a solid green light on the controller. The manual is not badly written but you can tell English was not their first language. There are some errors in the manual for directions also. It tells you to trim out the drone settings to the middle. Well there is NO screen on the controller to do so. So that can not be done until you do a first fly and on a calm day!The manual also tells you on page 10 to enter headless mode by pressing the RIGHT top button when in fact its the LEFT top.And there are 2 top left buttons so make sure you carefully read the manual! It also says that after you hold this button for 2 seconds there will be letters of STICK MOD on the LCD screen, BUT there is NO LCD screen.If you have a smart phone or an Apple your in for a treat. This has wifi and it works great. The software is simple but yet functional. Apple users can get it at the app store searching for MJX C4005 FPV.Android users must go to the website at mjxrc and search for the droid version with the same file name. The app is about 38 MB and nicely installs on an external sd card on your phone if you have one. It doesn&rsquo;t demand your main storage at least not on an android phone anyway.You can take photos while flying. Watch your flight in real time with only a slight delay in video and of course you can take video. I wish I had a VR headset to try it out in. The app allows you to switch to 3d. That would be so fun but you might get carried away and your Quad might fly far away on you. Good to have a spotter with you if your going to fly VR HAHA.I do wish I could try out the Upgrade version of this Quad.MJX X400-V2. I would love to try the remote with the screen feature.But this baby has some bells and whistles too. Headless mode. Return to home or 1 key return&hellip;.The manual contradicts itself and says it has 3 speeds but then says it has two speeds in another area. Page 3 says 2 flight modes low and high but page 9 states low medium and high speed. I honestly forgot to try it.I love the lights on this drone. You can remotely shut them off if you want. But they are pretty Blue in the front and orange in the back. I flew in the dark and it looked cool. It can do manual rolls in high speed or key rolls in any speed. For the price I think it was well worth it!</p>

<h5 id="lots-of-fun">Lots of fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found that this drone flies great if you take the time to understand the controls and make sure that it&rsquo;s level before you turn it on. The drone finds its &ldquo;balance&rdquo; during the first few seconds that it has power. If it&rsquo;s leaning one way or the other during this time it will tend to wander. I also found that putting it in headless mode makes it easier to fly for newbies like myself. This drone is very durable and there are replacement parts available on Amazon that won&rsquo;t break the bank. Don&rsquo;t forget to order extra batteries. You will want them so that you can fly more than 10 minutes or so at a time. The first video I shot was upside down. It turns out that there is a &ldquo;180 degrees&rdquo; button in the app that needed clicked before recording video.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-for-1st-time-drone-users">Good product for 1st time drone users</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Initial thoughts - opening package and putting it all together. We noticed the control buttons were not on the remote. We appreciated that so they wouldn&rsquo;t break off during shipping. My son is the one that put it all together. A few spots here and there took him some time, but overall not too bad. He believes the size of the unit and blades will be able to withstand higher winds (something his smaller drone can&rsquo;t do). He noticed the camera can be removed (again something his smaller drone isn&rsquo;t capable of). It came with extra pieces which is nice for the amatur drone user who is likely to crash it a few times. The app needed to be installed on the phone was not in english( the directions)After using it a couple of times here is his thought pros/cons in no particular order&hellip;Good stability, not great camera quality, small parts easy to lose, lights on drone make it easy to see at night but night camera is terrible, 1st person view pretty responsive.Overall for the price it is a fun little drone for someone to try out. The fancy more expensive ones might last longer and do more but we are just fiddling around kinda like playing with remote control cars.</p>

<h5 id="happy-flying">Happy flying</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did some research and came up with this drone. The drone pricing and features were right on target. It is excellent for beginner flyers. It&rsquo;s quite fun. I have tried this drone indoors and outdoors for some crash tests and practice and let me tell you, this drone was absolutely fun. I can&rsquo;t believe how difficult these things are to fly. Remember that it&rsquo;s camera is not as clear as a smartphone but it&rsquo;s the memories that matter. The video is in color and people are recognizable in it. Also it is easy to connect to a laptop computer to retrieve the pics and videos. I highly recommend this drone as it&rsquo;s inexpensive but you get so much in return.</p>

<h5 id="good-price-for-beginners">Good price for beginners!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! This is my first drone and even though I never flew one before I got the hang of it. ! I recommend you find a simple YouTube Video to teach you how to fly if it is your first time. Once you understand the basics of the controller, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to fly right out of the box. Give yourself some open space. The FPV feature is actually pretty awesome for the price. Just download an app on your phone and you can see live video feeds from your drone. Fly&rsquo;s fairly smooth up and down and in all directions. Lights during night time flying are bright and fun. It is really fast has a really nice camera for the price you are getting it at and i was very impressed of how far it goes up in the air.Recommend to my friend go get one.</p>
