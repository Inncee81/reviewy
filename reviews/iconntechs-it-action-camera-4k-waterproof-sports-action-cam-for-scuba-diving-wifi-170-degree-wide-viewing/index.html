<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<ul>
<li>NOT ALL 4K ACTION CAMERAS ARE CREATED EQUAL: Video qualities largely depend on the CPUs of your action cameras - chipsets. Powered by one of the best chipsets Novatek NT96660, combined with SONY cmos sensor with enhanced noise reduction and twice the sensitivity to light, this sports camera shoot 20MP photos with vibrant colors, less picture noise, and superb contrast even during early dawn or nighttime</li>
<li>CAPTURE UNDERWATER ACTION WITH WATERPROOF HOUSING AND DIVING MODE: ALL cameras come with waterproof cases that enable you to dive 30m deep. Go water-skiing, swimming, or scuba diving with ease. In diving mode, the Action Camera has added a red filter that automatically compensates for the lack of red light underwater so your video delivers vivid and accurate colors even in dim light</li>
<li>VIEW THE WORLD IN ASTONISHING DETAIL WITH ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION 4K: Our Action Camera features 4K, the new video benchmark that’s ideal for capturing all the excitement of sports in amazingly crisp and clear definition. It allows you to shoot dramatic still photos, or record stunning videos with 4x as many pixels as HD at the rate of 24 frames per second</li>
<li>170 DEGREE WIDE ANGLE LENS LETS YOU TAKE IT ALL IN &ndash; IN ONE SHOT: With adjustable viewing angles that let you choose anywhere from 70 to 170 degrees, our Action Camera lets you focus on a spot, or see the bigger picture. With a wider field of vision, you can take amazing shots of a quarterback running in a field, a basketball player taking a jumpshot at the court, or the entire cheering crowd at the arena</li>

<li><p>UP TO 128GB MICRO-SD STORAGE: Use the camera more with expanded storage. With our camera you’ll capture more action than other cameras. (Note the card must be an original high speed 6 class and formatted before use)</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-news-and-bad-news">Good news and bad news</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just came back from a white river rating with this camera attached to my helmet. Good news and bad news&hellip;The good is that the 1080p 60fps quality is great (considering the price of the camera I&rsquo;d say even beyond expectations), and the case is really waterproof (at some rapids I, and the camera, were fully underwater and the camera stayed dry). Though small (in size and in price), it is packed with many features that you would only find in higher end (and price) cameras: you can set the view angle from 70 to 170 degrees, use the internal gyroscope for added image stability, and of course the 4K to name a few.What I see as bad may not affect you, depends on your use for the camera. The problem is that when the camera is mounted on a helmet and you don&rsquo;t see the LCS screen, there&rsquo;s no way to tell if the video is running or not, and sometimes I thought it was recording and it wasn&rsquo;t. The camera has a good feature that it announces when it starts recording (I guess it was made exactly for this situation, when you can&rsquo;t see the back screen), but with the waterproof case you cannot hear it. Other cameras solved that problem with providing a wrist remote to control the camera when it&rsquo;s out of reach/site.Another problem was that when battery was low, the camera shut itself down after about 10-30 seconds while recording. I turned it on again, started recording (there was still enough juice in the battery to start another recording) but again it shut off after a few seconds. Very annoying. The battery lasted about an hour, as promised, however, considering that when it&rsquo;s at a low level it starts acting up (as I described above), I&rsquo;d say that it only runs reliably for about 40 minutes.I sent an e-mail with my concerns to the manufacturer and they were very prompt and responsive. They tried to work with me on the problems and suggested that there might be a problem with the specific unit that I received. I am going to return it and try a new one to see if battery life improves.</p>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are thinking of getting an &ldquo;ActionCam&rdquo;, this is a GREAT option if you&rsquo;re not ready to pay up for a GoPro. We&rsquo;ve had it for about three weeks now and it does everything we had hoped it would do. Will edit this if we run into any longevity issues in the future but for right now, I highly recommend it as a great value item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-sharp-video-needs-better-instructions">So far. so good. Sharp video, needs better instructions &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: The box is sturdy and well packed with everything promised. The camera has a nice look and feel to it. I tried it in a swimming pool and it didn&rsquo;t leak and took very sharp, nice looking video (1080p x 60fps). It has lots of useful features. The wifi works and so does the android app. Battery life seems to be between 45 minutes and an hour, not too bad.Cons: For several weeks I kept asking about spare batteries but nobody from the company answered. (Finally a customer posted a link to spare batteries/charger &ndash; see the &ldquo;answered questions&rdquo;.) The user interface is a little clunky and slow, but that&rsquo;s to be expected when there are so few buttons to control everything (this video helps you figure out how to work everything easier than the instruction manual:[&hellip;]. I couldn&rsquo;t find instructions for the android app, so it&rsquo;s all trial and error and not easy to figure out.Overall: Pretty well satisfied so far. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to GoPro. Main complaints are user friendliness, manufacturer support (information) and instructions. I will update the review after using it for free diving. I&rsquo;m looking forward to see if the diving mode really works (instead of using a red filter) and if it is really waterproof (I&rsquo;ll go up to 20m).</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-really-nice-4k-action-camera">This is a really nice 4K Action camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a really nice 4K Action camera. We own one of the big brand name action cameras and this one is comparable or better actually in quality of the video and features. The waterproof housing that is included is very waterproof and I have had no problems at all using this in water. We have tried it in up to about 5 feet of water successfully. The photos and video are high quality and the camera is easy to use, with the buttons working well through the camera case. The camera case can be a challenge to get on and off but I imagine that makes it as well sealed as it is. You can see my video of how to get it off and on easily. The included accessories are a nice added bonus as well. Over all I am very happy - saved money from some of the larger brand names and an even nicer product!</p>

<blockquote>
<p> This product SPECTACULAR. I own the oldest go pro action camera but it is not as nice as this. The oldest one I had you can view what you are taking but with this I can see it. The variety of attachments is nice with a strong waterproof protection and detailed manual that is very helpful to learn about this device. The video high quality are perfect. The images are clear and bright and the amount of features/options in the menu is incredible. Great camera resolution. This is perfect for what I am looking for. You can also use the wifi function and connect the device to your phone.Overall, I am very satisfied with this product. The price is right and works really amazing. Highly recommended if you are looking for affordable camera but with good quality.</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommend-this-camera">Highly recommend this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Highly recommend this camera. I bought my brother a GoPro for christmas a few years back and spent $200+ on sale. This one was only $83 at the time I bought it and is practically the same thing. The only difference I see in them is the waterproof case isn&rsquo;t combatible. As far as the setting between the two I haven&rsquo;t fooled around with my brothers GoPro enough to see a significant difference. I am very pleased with this camera. My husband, my dog and I take this camera kayaking, fishing, hiking, etc. and it has worked so well. The only complaint I have is I dropped it into the water and the screen on the waterproof case cracked around the corners, but it is still waterproof. If you are looking for an alternative to the GoPro or just a second camera for multiple angles without breaking the bank I highly recommend giving this one a shot.</p>
