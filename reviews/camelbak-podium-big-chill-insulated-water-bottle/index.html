</ul>

<p>CamelBak Podium Big Chill 25 oz is a high performance insulated sport bottle that keeps your water cooler longer. A double-walled bottle construction uses closed cell foam technology to keep your water cold twice as long as a standard bottle. The patented spill-proof Jet Valve allows the user to hydrate immediately without having to open or close a drinking interface and the bottle&rsquo;s streamlined ergonomic design offers excellent squeezability without compromising bottle grip. The large aperture of the drinking nozzle generates an exceptional water flow rate and is easy to remove for thorough cleaning. The Podium Chill also has a lockout dial with easy to read graphics for leak-proof transport.</p>

<h5 id="no-freezing-fluids-on-winter-rides">No freezing fluids on winter rides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeps your hydration fluids from freezing in the winter (have not had a chance to ride with it in the summer). No leaking was noted on my winter rides. Be sure and measure distance of your water bottle cage to the top tube to make sure it fits. Otherwise, you may need the 21 oz size or just ride with the bottle just off to the side.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-purchased-2-of-these-for-my-specialized-allez">I purchased 2 of these for my specialized allez, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 2 of these for my specialized allez, and I found out that it is to large of a bottle for the rear cage, it gets stuck/hits the top tube when pulling it out, putting it back in. I have returned it and still waiting for my credit so I can purchase a 21oz.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the opening and the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t leak or spill. I kind of expected because it is a CamelBak product and insulated that it would keep the ice water colder longer. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case. While it did keep the water colder longer than my last bottles, it isn&rsquo;t a long term cooler by any means. A couple hours later and you&rsquo;ll have tepid water. The good news is it doesn&rsquo;t get all plasticky tasting because I washed it before using it.I don&rsquo;t put anything but water and ice in my bottles, I hand wash them, and I try to give them drying time. I will update if I happen to see the mold problems other people are having.I initially got these bottles for biking (not super long distances), but they fit just fine strapped into a camera pack as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work very well. I don&rsquo;t know if they keep water all that cold&hellip;but&hellip;they work well and no spilling. I use the friendly swede cages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-summer-beater">My summer beater</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I prefer insulated stainless bottles for daily use, because I like my water consistently cold. Also, you get the options for straw features. However, in the hot summer heat I tend to refill my bottles more often, so this bottle serves me well for that. Cram a bunch of ice in there or freeze a bit of water in there overnight. It can take more of a beating than stainless bottles when on the go, which is a huge plus for summer. Athletes, especially cyclists, should get their hands on this. My roommate bought one for his daily bike rides to work, and he&rsquo;s loving it. I just like it because it fits in my bag easier and can be thrown around more.</p>

<h5 id="very-durable-and-stylish-insulated-water-bottle-great-for-biking">Very Durable and Stylish Insulated Water Bottle. Great For Biking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great water bottle. Perfect to take with you biking, hiking, to gym, or just about anywhere. The nozzle comes off and is easy to clean. You can also turn it on the the top to either allow water flow or block it. Just turn the water bottle up and squeeze and you get a stream of water to quench that thirst. You will have to play with how hard you squeeze otherwise you will get more water that you can handle but that is easily figured out. The bottle is BPA free and very durable. The bottle is insulated and kept my water cold my entire bike ride. This bottle will last me a long time and I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-biking">Great for biking!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already have two Camelbak 70oz Rogue hydration pack for the wife and I. Sometimes it is too much firepower for an hour ride for exercise and it can be a pain to clean. The 25 oz and 21 oz are the perfect size to keep us hydrated in the 95-100 degree heat in the southwest. I usually fill the bottle with ice/water before the ride. The ice is almost melted and the water is still cool by the time I need to hydrate 30-60 minutes later. My old water bottle would already be same outdoor temps by this time. Hard to cool your core if you drinking hot water.I like the power squirt feature to quickly fill you mouth to rinse/spit or drink. Easy to squirt over your head on those really hot days. The softer sides make it easy to control the amount of water you squirt into your mouth. No more biting the top to open/close the water valve like my old bottle with the Camelbak nozzle. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with the top spilling when unlocked during the ride. The bottles fit in our cheap $3 bike bottle holders very well with zero chance of bouncing out. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with plastic taste with this bottle. Since it holds ice a lot longer, no need to freeze <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> full of water the night before. Not planning on using this bottle for anything other than water to keep it fresh as possible for the long term.Water from the bottle does not taste plasticky as long as you take the time to wash the bottle well. I add 5-6 drops of dish washing liquid soap, add hot water shake the bottle and squeeze the liquid/foam out through the valve. I repeat the process 2-3 more times, with hot water, till clear water flows out. Squeezing the water out through the valve is the key to removing the plasticky taste.</p>

<h5 id="fast-and-easy-to-use-while-riding-wish-it-had-better-insulation-though">Fast and easy to use while riding, wish it had better insulation though</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As with most insulated bike bottles, this won&rsquo;t keep your drink cold for more than an hour or so. I opted to not lock the nozzle, so I could grab the bottle while riding and squeeze it for fluid. The Polar I had was a decent bottle, but having to bite/lift the nozzle each time was hurting my jaws and a PITA overall. This CamelBak bottle was much faster to use.Overall: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars</p>
