<h5 id="i-love-this-speaker">I love this speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I love this speaker! I didn&rsquo;t change it when I got it. It lasted for about 3 days. I listen to it when I&rsquo;m in the car, since my aux doesn&rsquo;t work. The quality of sound is so pure. And the volume is pretty loud. I like the shape and style of it. It&rsquo;s easy to carry it with me everywhere. Big plus to the battery, that lasts for a long time. It has Bluetooth and a cable. Also when someone calls you, it says the phone number that is calling you. Great product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-bluetooth-speaker">I love this Bluetooth speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this Bluetooth speaker. First of all, this wireless, and connect my phone by Bluetooth,and it&rsquo;s easy to connect my phone. Good sound quality and so loud. It can be used for outdoor. The size is nice. I took a picture forthe speaker and a pen, so that you can know the size. The battery works very well, as we don&rsquo;t really have to charge it that often. I would like to recommend it to my friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-at-a-great-price">Good product at a great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I have bought many speakers that say they are Bluetooth compatible and that they deliver quality sound – I have been disappointed with every one of them until NOW. ZOEE wireless Bluetooth speaker has proven they are a top-notch contender for quality sound and it’s in a such a small package that it blows my mind. I really enjoy the look and durability of this BT speaker. Someone finally has put some thought into the design and performance of a BT speaker – BRAVO ZOEE. This is a powerful speaker for the price and the right size too. Would highly recommend this speaker. It is clear, portable and makes my music and podcasts sound great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-bluetooth-speaker-nice-bass">Very nice Bluetooth speaker! Nice BASS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is above adverage speaker! This has really good sound as long as you don&rsquo;t exceed its limits. Should you exceed its limitations you will hear it distort just a bit so keep that in mind. This has basically 3 types of inputs that would be Bluetooth, SD card, Aux cable for like a MP3 player.very nice speaker for the price I paid and now is part of my collection of Bluetooth speakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-definite-must-buy-bluetooth-speaker">A DEFINITE MUST BUY BLUETOOTH SPEAKER!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome speaker with superb sound, cool design and plentiful options. The fact it was so inexpensive blows my mind. I LOVE IT!!!!! I recommend this to anyone interested in a great quality bluetooth speaker at an amazingly low price. You will not regret buying it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-little-bluetooth-speaker-for-the-price">Awesome little Bluetooth speaker for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little speaker for the workshop. I have a mini Bose in my office that I love. However, I didn&rsquo;t want to expose it to the sawdust in the workshop. This little speaker fit my needs: it has a great sound and the price was awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="music-from-tv-sounds-great">Music from TV sounds great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This speaker works great. I also bought the LURICO Bluetooth Transmitter from another seller so I could run the TV audio from the TV to the speaker when we sit outside. These two paired together well, and the speaker sounds great. We turn on the music channels from our cable and play it through the speaker while outside so we don&rsquo;t have to leave a door or window open to hear the TV. Music sounds fine, and we&rsquo;re glad we made the purchase. We would definitely buy from this seller again.</p>
</blockquote>
