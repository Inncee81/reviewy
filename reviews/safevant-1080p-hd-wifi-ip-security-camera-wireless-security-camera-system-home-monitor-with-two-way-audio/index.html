<h5 id="i-can-talk-to-my-dogs">I can talk to my dogs!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is awesome!! It provides a full view of my living room so I can see what my dogs are up to when I&rsquo;m gone for extended period of time. I can see them on my phone through a free app on my phone! The best part is that it&rsquo;s a two way radio. So not only can I hear what&rsquo;s going on, I can talk to them! They can hear my voice when. They might be doing something they aren&rsquo;t supposed to be doing, like getting on the couch. My German Shepard loves to sneak in the couch when he thinks I&rsquo;m not around!This would work for a child monitor, security, etc as well! I highly recommend this camera for many different reasons!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="super-easy-to-set-up">Super Easy to Set Up!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received my camera today and was worried about setting it up. I&rsquo;m not very savvy at all when it comes to stuff like this. No reason to worry! I set it up and had it up and running in less than 10 minutes! I bought it to keep an eye on my pets while I&rsquo;m at work. My old camera that just stopped working was old school! This one I can adjust the view, hear my pets AND talk to them. Very cool. I highly recommend this camera!!READ MORE</p>
