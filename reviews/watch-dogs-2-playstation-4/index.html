<p> When first mission involves hacking a movie studio, stealing their next script, and saving the butchered franchise by stealing the main prop and crashing it through the big billboard for the movie&hellip;you know it&rsquo;s gonna be a great game!Pros:-San Francisco map (Golden Gate looks amazing during a sun rise or set via a drone)-Fantastic hacking scenarios (ie satellite payload of a &lsquo;SpaceX&rsquo; rocket)-Music (Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival coming on during a mission where you blow up rigged voting machines was AMAZING)Cons:-AI (sometimes the AI of enemies, or just normal bystanders were really poor)-Online Multiplayer (none of it works, hopefully they will work out the kinks)</p>

<p>This is a great game better story and gameplay than the first worth the buy it arrived on time and well packaged but if your not a stealth person you might struggle in some parts of the game</p>

<h5 id="what-a-turnaround">What A Turnaround</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is genuinely astonishing what a turnaround this game is from Watch Dogs 1. I played through one, and while I found the game mechanics were solid, the narrative was so awful I was surprised when a sequel was announced. The reviews when it came out were good, too! Incredible! Having finished the game, it really is a fantastic time.The mechanics are largely unchanged from the first game, but what really enhances and improves this followup is the tone and setting. By taking things much less seriously and setting the game in San Francisco, it&rsquo;s just a far more enjoyable time. Instead of a droll, miserable revenge trip with am unlikeable protagonist, we have a bizarre and humorous &ldquo;fight the system&rdquo; romp with a main character who is a riot. The story has serious beats, but in general it avoids the swampy angst in favor of a more prankster vibe. I didn&rsquo;t play any of the online content, but the core single player experience was just excellent.Imagine that, making a game FUN to play pays off!</p>

<h5 id="you-don-t-need-to-play-it-but-it-gets-the-job-done">You don&rsquo;t NEED to play it, but it gets the job done.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I Didn&rsquo;t play Watch Dogs 1 since nothing about that game seemed like it was actually anything interesting, but I gotta call em like I see em. This game is a joy. It isn&rsquo;t revolutionary or a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; by any stretch of the imagination, but if you&rsquo;ve been out of the Ubisoft open world game loop then this game will scratch that &ldquo;i need to play a good AAA open world game&rdquo; itch.PROS:- likable protagonist and supporting cast- mainline story does its job and is something we can all get behind: take down a jerk, silicon valley, pretentious techbro and his shady business.- solid gameplay that supports going full stealth, or just taking out your gun and shooting everyone in the room.CONS:- if the co-op and pvp elements aren&rsquo;t your cup of tea then a huge chunk of side activities aren&rsquo;t your cup of tea.- missions aren&rsquo;t varied enough. a lot of times you&rsquo;re just going into some compound, hideout, or company office and just gathering evidence, sabotaging tech, or just stealing the mission specific item. missions aren&rsquo;t that creative and ultimately they&rsquo;re mostly carried by the game&rsquo;s delightful cast of characters and their interactions with each other.- side content is a bit shallow and mostly amounts to races, collectables, or running errands.All in all Watch Dogs 2 isn&rsquo;t the massive, world shattering game that Ubisoft was hyping it up to be. But, it manages to be enjoyable in a time where the gaming community might be feeling a bit of burn out with these type of open world games.</p>

<h5 id="great-game-with-some-pretty-glaring-issues">Great game with some pretty glaring issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could give this game a 7.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> rating. The game is huge, fantastic, massive amounts of story content, and just in general super fun. But the multiplayer content was pretty bland and after completing the game there&rsquo;s really no reason to keep the game. Co-op missions are fun but after you do them once or twice they pretty much lose all of their value, you&rsquo;re pretty much getting Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Unity multiplayer on this front. there&rsquo;s no pvp content such as team deathmatch or anythinlike that, just hacking invasions and bounty hunts. Bounty hunting can be fun for a while but as the hunter you will get pretty sick of joinging a game just to have someone else kill your target before you even get to see them. You can also tell that this game has been in development for a long time, wich is good, because movement around the city is much better than the original, with a new climbing system that really opens up certain areas a lot more, you&rsquo;ll find yourself gettin on rooftops and exploring areas in a much more immersive way than the original that felt pretty epic considering the scale and beauty of these locations. BUT you can tell that certain textures look pretty cheap up close in certain cut scenes, and if you plan on using a sniper rifle at all you better be prepared to see some Minecraft level graphics at certain points. It&rsquo;s not a Battlefield game, visually, that&rsquo;s lll I&rsquo;m saying. The map was pretty disappointing as well, although this game does a much better job of using the areas in the game effectively, the actual size of the map is pretty decieving, half of it is just water, and the land masses on the North and East side of the map are barely used and pretty uniteresting. Seems like they could have done a better job on this game to make it something that players could constantly return to without having to restart the game. There&rsquo;s a DLC season pass thing going on, but comsidering what they&rsquo;re offering I highly doubt that it will be worth the wait for the content they will be putting out, seems like just a gimic they&rsquo;re using to make players fork out extra cash just to keeo their game relevant past the base game, wich could have really been done for free if they nincluded better multiplayer modes, more weapons (there&rsquo;s like 40 guns in the game total, and over half of them are worthless, and none of them are customizable). oh, and you can only carry 2 guns around now, instead they added new hacks accessible from the weapon wheel. Hacking is a wholemdifferent story, they expanded it, but at the same time hacks are much ess important to the gameplay than they use to be, and by making hacks more in depth, they also took away some of the ease of use the original games reflex style hacking system worked in combat. Now the hacking system is more stratagetic, wich is kind of cool, but once you get to the point where your flying drone can take out 40 bad guys in a area without ever having to take control of Marcus you begin to lose interest. Even on the hardest difficulty this game is still very easy.Basically, they added a lot to this game wich made it geat, but they also took out a LOT of what the original made great. It&rsquo;s a very very worth while game to play, but Ubisoft really needs to work out a better formula for Watch Dogs 3. With this game, and many other games they have put out recently, they&rsquo;ve hit the mark of making epic games that really just don&rsquo;t live up to the potential that game could have had if they focused on gameplay as much as they spend on map design and animation.ONE LAST THING: Story, ok, really fun and lighthearted, so a welcpme change of pace from the original for some people, but also sort of feels like it doesn&rsquo;t take itself seriously nnough, for a large portion of the game you will definitely feel like the antagonist instead of the protagonist unless you complete all the missions without killing a single person, wich is pretty unlikely on the higher difficulties.</p>
