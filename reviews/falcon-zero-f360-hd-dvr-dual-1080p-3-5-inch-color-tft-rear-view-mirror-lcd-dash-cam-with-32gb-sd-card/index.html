<ul>
<li>Easy set up for multi vehicle use, have the ability to use in additional vehicles</li>
<li>Night vision for interior clips and shots; ideal for Uber, Lyft, taxis, limos, etc.; Built-in microphone / speaker function.</li>
<li>180-degree rotating 120-degree viewing angle high-resolution wide-angle lens.</li>
<li>3.5-Inch Color TFT LCD</li>
<li>Falcon Zero 1 Year Manufacturer Warranty included - 32GB Class 10 UHS1 SD card included</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy Installation, Unlimited Viewing Angles, and Multi Vehicle Ready</p>

<p>The Falcon Zero F360 HD simply clamps over your rear view mirror allowing for optimal viewing angles; not limited as one would find in a dash cam that either sits on the dashboard.</p>

<p>Though some dash cams are able to suction cup to the windshield, this too can cause a headache if the suction becomes loose and falls off frequently and possibly causing damage to the device and maybe even not recording an important event. With the additional included equipment, easily transfer the unit between vehicles!</p>

<h5 id="great-dash-cam-looks-like-it-s-part-of-the-car-from-the-factory-so-far-so-good">Great Dash Cam, Looks Like it&rsquo;s Part of the Car from the Factory. So Far, So Good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the Falcon Zero F360+ for about a week now and I am impressed and completely satisfied with it. I was a bit worried with near-perfect reviews and I also noticed that many of the reviews were not for this product, but for a USB power adapter from the same company which made me wonder if these were legit to start with. I have had several dash cams and this one is the one that I am keeping.I was concerned that it would not fit my Mercedes E550C mirror because of the mirror&rsquo;s thickness (contains HomeLink buttons and has the factory camera behind the mirror for the adaptive cruise control and emergency braking system). The Falcon Zero actually fit right over the mirror with no problem and looks stock to most people that are in the car. I wired the system behind the trim and molding and it only took about 20 minutes and no wires are visible.I like that you can set the video display to shut off after a number of seconds so that it does not distract you while driving but can bring it up at any time with the press of a button. This dashcam can take HD Video as well as still pictures and has instructions that are easy to follow to personalize the camera. I also like that you can use one or both of the cameras depending on what you are using it for.The only &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; that I have is that the rear-facing camera has to look through the entire car before looking out the back window so the rear traffic video is not a wide as the front. I knew this when I bought it though and didn&rsquo;t want to have to wire a camera to sit in the back window deck so this works as good as it can without doing that. The cameras can be easily turned without turning the rear view mirror if you need to video out either the driver or passenger mirror.This would be the perfect option for an Uber driver or cab service, I bought because I seem to be a magnet for road rage and a dash cam has saved me on more than one occasion (kids trying to race me, doing burnouts, etc and when I was pulled over as being a participant I simply played video back and showed that I in fact was not participating). I find it numerous that when angry people see you have a camera they de-escalate quickly.I purchased this on a lightning deal from Black Friday but I think that it&rsquo;s worth every penny at the regular price. I will update in the future if I have any problems to report.</p>

<h5 id="this-dash-cam-is-a-one-a-kind">This dash cam is a one a kind</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You will not find a dash cam like this one. This dash cam is a one a kind and I like it personally because the mirror is very wide, love the quality, it captures everything too while i am driving. Highly recommend it !!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="arrived-super-fast-very-happy-with-the-product-so-far">Arrived super fast. Very happy with the product so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived super fast. Very happy with the product so far. Helps me feel safer when driving my rideshare. Could use a few more directions on use and features though. Good investment! Would buy it again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="have-to-give-it-up-to-the-customer-service">Have to give it up to the customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera is all great but I also have to give it up to the customer service because I was having some sort of trouble using it but with the guidance of the customer service I was able to get on the roll with the dash cam</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loving-the-warranty">Loving the warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the greatest things of the dash cam is not only the pictures or the videos qualities but the warranty. It has a 5 year warranty and that is something other companies don’t offer at all .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="takes-place-of">Takes place of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Rearview mirror which i think is awesome. Gives a clear view of what’s going on behind you while it&rsquo;s recording everything that’s happening around you. Very satisfying piece of technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="such-a-great-helper">Such a great helper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While I was driving one of the pedestrians was not looking and got hit by another car. The person tried blaming the driver but my dash cam recorded everything, I helped the driver not get arrested.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="won-t-fit-if-you-have-subaru-eyesight-installed">Won&rsquo;t fit if you have Subaru Eyesight installed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a well made product that works great, but won&rsquo;t fit on your mirror (not enough space above mirror) if you have the Subaru eyesight system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-camera-will-definitely-keep-you-safe">Awesome camera, will definitely keep you safe.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is sick. My only major challenge was getting it installed, but it was pretty getting all of the to hide in their little corners.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-love-this">Absolutely love this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so impressed by this. It is so cool, and the G-sensor detection thing works really well. Would recommend to any people afraid for their car.</p>
