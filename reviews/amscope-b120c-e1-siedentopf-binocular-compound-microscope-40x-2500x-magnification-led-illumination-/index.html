<p>About Microscopes
Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. AmScope has been manufacturing microscopy equipment and accessories since 1996, headquartering in Irvine, CA.</p>

<h5 id="profesional-quality-scope">Profesional Quality scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scope was very easy to setup and performs better than I expected for the price. The software and PC interface is fairly easy to use. The 2500x is a bit higher magnification than most other similar scopes.There&rsquo;s not much technical documentation with the software and scope. The PC view is pretty decent, but not a substitute for looking through the scope itself. If you can afford it, a separate camera mount that doesn&rsquo;t use one of the existing two eyepieces would be recommended.It was difficult choosing a model because there are so many AmScope models, with little information to differentiate them. I called AmScope and this one was recommended as a newer model with all the best features.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-scope">Great Scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have wanted a good microscope for home use for years but have not been willing to shell out the cash. Bought this microscope as my fortieth birthday present to myself and have used it at least three dozen times so far. I run a small farm and have done fecal exams and skin scrapings. I have two little girls and we have examined everything we could find under this microscope even my own blood. I have not used the USB yet as I am used to looking through a microscope and my girls can too so just haven&rsquo;t taken the time to hook it up. My degree is in biology and this microscope&rsquo;s quality is as good as any I ever used back in college. I researched long and hard, read every review. I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="incredible-value">INCREDIBLE VALUE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My father purchased a microscope for $5 for me when I was a kid. I love it and still have it. It was very imperfect, but I learned a lot from it. I didn&rsquo;t expect much more from this AmScope when I bought it for the price. I was wrong! This is an incredible machine. The first thing I noticed was that tthe edge to edge focus was flawless. The second thing I noticed was the lack of rainbows around the objects. As I moved the slides around I noticed the mechanisms for moving the slide were as smooth as butter, and easy to use. Attached is a sunflower stem to show how beautiful it can be looking through the microscope.</p>

<h5 id="amscope-b120c-e1-binocular-compound-digital-microscope-for-our-biology-laboratory-brian-h-davis-msc-cph-san-francisco-ca">AmScope B120C-E1 Binocular Compound Digital Microscope for our Biology Laboratory (Brian H. Davis, MSc, CPH) San Francisco, CA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice binocular compound digital microscope and perfect purchase for my laboratory and for my AP Biology, Lab Biology and Anatomy and Physiology students. Great price and value considering the high quality. I was extremely pleased with this product and everything, including the extra objectives were in perfect condition and in working order. Software was easy to download from there website, the only drawback was finding the enclosed CD without the MAC powerbook version of the software. Although, this was easily found and downloaded from the Amscope&rsquo;s website. I was so happy with this purchase that I have decided to purchase 4 more disecting binocular compound microscopes from AmScope again.</p>

<h5 id="great-microscope-for-livestock">Great Microscope for Livestock</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a small goat farm and needed our own microscope to fun fecal exams and gather performance data on our goats. The microscope is excellent! Came packed securely. I bought the one with the computer attachment because that allows us to take pictures of what we find and share with the veterinarian or to train other users. The gears on the table move smoothly and allow us to use McMaster slides and do counts on parasites. This will also be quite handy to do blood smears and other projects.The low cost of this microscope is less than the price of one goat! We are very pleased with this equipment and are encouraging our friends to buy one as well. Paying a little extra for binocular vision and the computer setup was well worth it. Another bonus that I didn&rsquo;t realize until we bought the scope is that the headpiece swivels, so that if one person focuses on something, they can swivel the binoculars to someone sitting across from them without moving the microscope.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-was-hoping-for-a-better-than-average-scope-that-we-could-both-enjoy">I was hoping for a better than average scope that we could both enjoy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who is a budding scientist. I was hoping for a better than average scope that we could both enjoy. I was happy to find a high quality ( better than her Middle School teachers ) scope. The software for the computer works well and captures still shots and short video. The image quality on the computer is only average but the direct vision is great. I am a Doctor used to looking through scopes and I would accept this scope in my clinic. If you buy.. Enjoy the hidden universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-quality">Fantastic quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had trepidation about buying a microscope at this price level, a low one in my opinion for a scientific instrument. I am happy to admit that that fear was unfounded as I am astounded at the quality of this scope! The build quality is excellent and has several features which I did not expect such as a swiveling head, included light filter and condenser iris.While the 1.3MP camera is not of the greatest quality, it is just fine for area observers and for capturing photos and video. The USB cord sticking out of it gets in the way a little, but a small complaint.All in all, if you are looking for a high-quality instrument, this is an excellent buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-microscope-it-did-not-come-with-the-oil">Great microscope! It did not come with the oil &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great microscope! It did not come with the oil necessary to use the highest magnification, but it&rsquo;s pretty cheap. Also, the serial code needed to get the instruction manual was nowhere to be found, but after getting in contact with customer service, they just emailed me the manual.We&rsquo;ve been looking at all kinds of things! Chameleon skin, fruit flies, and even a bit of blood! The oil just arrived the other day, so we&rsquo;ll be excited to use the highest magnification setting.</p>
