<p>From the Manufacturer
One look at Canon&rsquo;s new PowerShot S95 will have you moving &ldquo;upgrade my digital camera&rdquo; to the top of your to-do list. The ultra-slim, ultra-intelligent S95 is loaded with all a serious photographer&rsquo;s must-haves, including a bright f/2.0 wide-angle lens and professional-style control ring for intuitive manual control. Canon&rsquo;s HS System is on board for spectacular performance and image quality in low light.</p>

<p>And, new for a compact, the S95 incorporates Canon&rsquo;s Hybrid IS for blur-free shooting even close-up. You&rsquo;ll shoot stunning 720p HD video with stereo sound, then watch it immediately on your HDTV with the simple HDMI connection. If photography&rsquo;s your passion, now is the perfect time to step up to PowerShot S95.</p>

<p>Canon PowerShot S95 Highlights</p>

<p>Canon&rsquo;s HS System for improved low light performance and better image quality
The PowerShot S95 employs the Canon HS System by combining a powerful 10.0-megapixel CCD sensor and Canon&rsquo;s DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Thanks to this technological advancement, the S95 is dramatically more sensitive than cameras with identical megapixel counts, and delivers spectacular images with minimal noise. Increased sensitivity demands a higher ISO speed, and the PowerShot S95 delivers with a new maximum setting of ISO 12,800. Blur and camera shake are notably reduced for the ultimate in sharpness and clarity.</p>

<p>Shoot beautiful 720p HD video in stereo sound
The PowerShot S95 lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD videos (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition TV monitor. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once.</p>

<p>Control ring for intuitive manual control
Focus, Exposure, ISO, Step Zoom, or White Balance can now be adjusted more precisely than ever with the S95&rsquo;s control ring. It&rsquo;s even more intuitive and quicker than the usual 2-button control and the S95 lets you decide which function the ring will adjust.</p>

<p>Bright f/2.0 lens
The S95 sports an f/2.0 aperture, perfect for creating enticing portraits, by drawing attention to the face and blurring the background with its impressively shallow depth-of-field. The Macro setting lets you get even closer. The large aperture also does more. It lets you capture more nuances in low light shooting by using more of the available light. You&rsquo;ll be ready for anything with a lens aperture larger than even many professional sizes.</p>

<p>Canon&rsquo;s Hybrid IS to compensate for angular and shift camera shake during close-up shooting</p>

<p>The PowerShot S95 is one of the first compact cameras to be equipped with Canon&rsquo;s highly advanced Hybrid IS function, which corrects camera shake from two sources to deliver sharp, blur-free images even when you zoom in close to your subject.</p>

<p>Hybrid IS employs both an angular sensor and an accelerometer, enabling it to suppress both the blur caused by the angle of the camera and the &ldquo;shift blur&rdquo; that happens when your subject moves parallel to the camera, a problem that is especially noticeable at large zoom factors.</p>

<p>With the ability to produce clear, steady images in most situations and at any zoom length, the PowerShot S95 is the camera you&rsquo;ll want to take everywhere.</p>

<p>Full range of shooting and recording modes
The PowerShot S95&rsquo;s RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting.</p>

<p>Also, with 26 Shooting Modes including 18 Special Scene Modes, you&rsquo;re ready for whatever shot comes your way.</p>

<p>3.8x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer, plus a 28mm wide-angle lens
The PowerShot S95 features Canon&rsquo;s precision 28mm wide-angle 3.8x optical zoom lens that allows you to shoot most scenes from wide-angle to telephoto. It lets you capture more in every frame, so everyone fits in a family gathering shot. When it&rsquo;s time to take a closer look, the Canon Optical Image Stabilizer helps minimize camera shake and reveal almost every detail.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-image-quality-full-controls-and-pocketable">Excellent image quality, full controls and pocketable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a pocketable camera that has reasonably high quality images, lets you control aperture, speed and focus and shoot in RAW format, this is it. I bought mine as an upgrade from a previous small but versatile camera, a Canon Powershot S70.The Powershot S95 was introduced in August 2010 as a slight upgrade to the S90, which was widely praised for its image quality and excellent interface but criticized for being hard to hold (&ldquo;like a bar of soap in the shower&rdquo;) and for having a control dial that turned too easily. The S95 fixes both problems and adds a couple of other features in a package that fits in the pocket of your jeans (if they&rsquo;re not super tight). The case is metal, and although there are no finger grips on the body, it&rsquo;s not slippery at all. It feels like it&rsquo;s covered with super-fine sandpaper (like 1000 or 1500 grit, for those you who know what that feels like).The second major complaint about the S-90 was that the function selection ring on the rear moved too easily. The ring on the S-95 has a slight click when you move it, and it doesn&rsquo;t move unless you want it to.There are a couple of other cameras of this type, including the Panasonic LX-3 and LX-5 and the Samsung TL500. They all have let you control camera functions, and like the S95 they have 10 MP sensors that are almost twice as large as a typical pocket camera, so the pixels on the sensor are larger. That lets them gather light more efficiently, which reduces digital &ldquo;noise&rdquo; when you shoot in dim light. Image quality is noticeably better than photos from typical pocket cameras. You can make an 8 x 10 or perhaps 11x14 enlargement, although a digital SLR will be significantly better for larger prints. They also have f/2.0 lenses at their widest angle, although the aperture closes down as you zoom in.The Canon has two advantages over the Panasonic LX-3 &amp; LX-5. First, you really can put it in your pocket or in a belt case no bigger than the one you use for a mobile phone. Second, the interface is a brilliant re-thinking of how a very small camera with a full set of controls should work. There&rsquo;s not much room for buttons on the small surface, but you don&rsquo;t have to get into a multi-level menu on the LCD, and yet changing settings is fast and intuitive.For example, there&rsquo;s a ring around the lens that you can grip easily to control zoom, or, shutter speed, or aperture, change ISO, or manually focus. You select what you want it to do by pressing a button on the top, and when you look at the LCD screen you can see what it&rsquo;s programmed for. There&rsquo;s a selection wheel on the back for other functions, and when you move it, a clear set of choices appears on the screen. The selections are context-appropriate, so they change depending on whether you&rsquo;ve set the camera for aperture control, &ldquo;Program&rdquo; control, etc.The two Panasonics have the same sensor as their Canon equivalents, but they offer a slightly wider lens (24mm vs. 28 for the S95). The LX-3 has a much shorter telephoto - only 60 mm. The LX-5, which was introduced a couple of weeks before the S95, has a 90mm telephoto, and you can buy an add-on optical viewfinder. It also has a flash shoe in addition to the pop-up flash, although you can buy a dedicated add-on flash for the S-95 to supplement its pop-up flash The LX-5 is about 25% more expensive than the Canon S95 (and 60% more with the optional viewfinder) and while it would fit in a coat pocket, you can&rsquo;t stuff it into a trouser pocket.If you want a truly pocketable camera that gives you good image quality and full control over your photography, the S95 is an excellent choice.</p>

<h5 id="small-camera-with-a-big-heart-sensor">Small camera with a big heart (sensor)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is, without a doubt, one of the best compact cameras in the world. What makes it so great?Pros:+ Large <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.7&rdquo; sensor. One of the main reasons why DSLRs look so much better than compacts is the size of the sensor. A larger sensor has two main benefits. One is reduced noise at the same ISO, allowing you to take pictures in lower light. For ordinary compacts noise becomes a problem even at ISO 200, but DSLRs can go all the way to ISO 1600. Another is bokeh, or the quality of out-of-focus areas. When you take a portrait, you want the background to be blurred so that only your subject is in focus. According to physics, a larger sensor allows for a narrower depth of field, and hence more out-of-focus backgrounds. The S95&rsquo;s sensor is about twice as large as a typical compact&rsquo;s <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.5&rdquo; sensor, so it has half the noise. It&rsquo;s still not large enough for good bokeh, even at f/2, but you expect that of a compact.+ Full P, A, S, M modes. (Canon calls A Av and S Tv, but same thing.) These modes are very important to serious photographers because they allow more creative control over the image, such as setting exposure compensation (+/-), shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc.+ Two customizable control rings, one on the barrel of the lens and one on the rear. DSLRs have dials so that you don&rsquo;t have to dig around in a bunch of menus to change options. With one flick, you can set ISO and +/- in P mode, aperture and +/- in A mode, shutter speed and +/- in S mode, and aperture and shutter speed in M mode. However, you can program them to a variety of different options based on your preference.+ Customizable shortcut button, which you can set to easily access a bunch of menu items. Personally I have it on white balance.+ RAW mode, which allows the photographer more control over the end image. You can open it up in Adobe Camera Raw and edit it in Photoshop, or use the provided free software to process and edit it. RAW is great for recovering highlight and shadow detail which would have been lost in a JPEG.+ Fast f/2 lens. Most compacts have maximum aperture of f/2.8, so the S95 lens can let in twice as much light as other compacts. Combined with the larger sensor, the S95 has about four times the low-light performance of regular point-and-shoots.+ Small form factor. Small enough to fit in a pants pocket, you can enjoy your trip/party/event without dragging along a bulky DSLR.+ Shoots movies in 720p with stereo sound.+ Customizable ISO Auto. ISO Auto sets the ISO automatically in order to ensure a fast enough shutter speed, and you can set the Max ISO Speed and Rate of Change. I normally keep it on 400 and Standard. For landscapes, I use 400 and Slow. For parties, I use 800 and Fast.+ C mode, which remembers all the settings on the camera and can be accessed via the mode dial.+ My Menu, allowing quick access to five menu items of your choice.+ Exposure and focus bracketing, which allows you to take three pictures with different exposures or different focus settings in order to ensure you have a correctly exposed/focused image. But more importantly, exposure bracketing can be used for HDR (blending different images of the same subject in Photoshop to get a correctly exposed final image).Cons:- Limited zoom range. The lens only goes from 28 mm (wide, but not ultrawide) to 105 mm (medium tele), by 35 mm equivalent.- f/4.9 aperture at tele end. You lose about 2 <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> stops of light compared to f/2 at the wide end.- No hotshoe. It would have been nice to be able to add an external flash for more power and to allow bouncing at an angle, though I suppose a gigantic flash on a tiny camera would look rather ridiculous.- Body is a little bit slippery.- No 1080p, if you really want Full HD video.Neutral:o Decent battery life. Its Canon NB-6L battery (3.7 V, 1000 mAh) is rated for 200 shots. In practice, I&rsquo;ve only taken 120 shots in a row without a charge and haven&rsquo;t had the battery die on me, so the battery life is sufficient for me. I know that other premium compacts often have more robust batteries, so that might be a point of consideration or you could just get a spare NB-6L.o 10 MP resolution. Don&rsquo;t believe the megapixel myth which states that the more megapixels, the better. The last time I checked, Sony is coming up with a 16 MP point-and-shoot which is really excessive. The problem with more megapixels is that now they have to squeeze more pixels into the same area, so less light hits each pixel, and with less light you get more noise.o Made in Japan (actually a very weak pro). It&rsquo;s always nice to know that your camera is made in the country with the best quality control in the world. However, I haven&rsquo;t heard any complaints about Canons made in China, so I suppose the advantage is marginal at best.o Pop-up flash. On one hand, it allows the camera to be made smaller instead of having a flash directly on the front. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s annoying that you have to move your finger whenever the flash pops up.Compared:o With the Canon S90: The S95 fixes the problem of the loose rear dial rotating too easily by adding some soft clicks in it. Also improves video to 720p stereo (compared to VGA mono).o With the Canon S100: The S100, which was just announced, improves the lens as both ends, to 24-120 mm f/2-4.9. It now has a 12 MP CMOS sensor with DIGIC V processor (compared to 10 MP CCD with DIGIC IV). I don&rsquo;t believe the first two will have much effect on image quality, and we&rsquo;ll have a few months before the S100 ships to see how good the DIGIC V really is. The S100 also adds GPS tagging and 1080p video. It now uses a NB-5L battery (3.7V 1120 mAh) and adds a rubber grip to the front. The S100 also lets you zoom during videos.o With the Canon G12: This is where it really matters; the previous two were just versions of essentially the same product. The main differences are ergonomic: the G12 is much bigger and has better build quality but will not fit in your pocket. The internals are very similar, as both use the same 10 MP <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.7&rdquo; CCD. The G12 has the same lens control ring but also has direct +/- and ISO dials on top, and adds an optical viewfinder. The G12 has a 28-140 f/2.8-4.5 lens, which gives you a bit more reach on the long end. The G12 has a hotshoe, if you need an external flash. The G12 uses a much bigger NB-7L battery (7.4V 1050 mAh), allowing for 370 shots.o With the Panasonic DMC-LX5: The LX5 also has a 10 MP <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.7&rdquo; CCD (actually 10.1 MP <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.63&rdquo;, but they&rsquo;re virtually identical). It features a Leica 24-90 mm f/2-3.3 lens, so both have 3.8x zoom but the LX5 is wider on both ends. The LX5 has a much larger aperture at the tele end (f/3.3 vs f/4.9). Both have 720p video, but the LX5 allows zooming and manual control during videos and has better video IS while the S95 has a less leaky CCD (sometimes purple streaks can show up in video mode for a CCD). The LX5 is slightly larger and slightly more expensive. However, it lacks the unique dual control rings of the S95, which are invaluable to me.Overall:If you are a photography enthusiast who wants to travel light, this should be your top pick. You can get the G12 for more features and better build, but you&rsquo;d be spending $100 more on average and sacrificing the small size. (Think about it, if you really want to go all in why not bring a DSLR?) The LX5 is also a great camera and you should consider it if you prefer its lens and video quality, but the S95 is more pocketable and features dual control rings offering quick, menu-free manual control. You could also wait until November to get the S100, but until then we can only guess at whether it&rsquo;s a worthy upgrade from the S95.</p>
