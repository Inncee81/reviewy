<h5 id="amazing-for-the-price">Amazing for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This backpack is as nice as other backpacks that literally cost twice as much. I use it for college, and it holds everything I need. It holds my laptop, notebooks, calculator, pens/pencils, glasses, umbrella, textbooks (including my insanely large anatomy textbook), and it even holds my Nintendo Switch. All at once!The only complaint I have is a minor one. It&rsquo;s about the charging port. I knew going into it that it didn&rsquo;t include a charger, but I am kinda bummed out that there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated pocket for one. The charging cord used to connect to the battery is pretty unruly and creates a bit of a mess. I&rsquo;d like a more organized approach. But other than that, I have no other complaints!UPDATE: I do have another minor complaint. I wish the back was a bit more breathable, as when I wear this on a hot day, my back gets drenched in sweat. Still a great backpack though.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-bag-to-carry-basketball-and-other-stuff">Perfect Bag to carry Basketball and other stuff.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son is very happy with this bag, it&rsquo;s large enough for his school books (a couple of 1-in. binders, folders and a small laptop) and holds his basketball securely in place while he rides his bike. It seems to be made of good quality material. He hasn&rsquo;t used the charging port yet, but it&rsquo;s a plus if he needs to.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-quite-an-interesting-idea-to-charge-your-phone">It is quite an interesting idea to charge your phone &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is quite an interesting idea to charge your phone with backpack directly! Now that&rsquo;s my must- take backpack to road trip!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="teenager-approved">Teenager approved!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this for our 17 year old son who is a Senior in high school. He is very picky about everything. He really loves this pack, it does all he needs. From the built in usb to the net for his basketball it is great for him. It is made very well and he is a happy camper with this pack. Plenty of space in the pack and stands up to the demanding life of an active teenager!!!!</p>

<h5 id="the-perfect-sport-backpack">The perfect sport backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We will see how this backpack holds up throughout the school year but I have to say this is the most perfect backpack for my daughter. Her phone often dies when she is away at games, so having a built in charger is phenomenal! The net to carry her basketball/volleyball is really fantastic too because she always has one with her.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-usb-port-backpack">Great usb port backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves the backpack. It was smaller than we had thought but not to much smaller. He loves it has a port area to have the ability to charge his electronic devices. We are working on getting a good extended battery to install in the backpack so he can have the ability to charge his devices. The backpack is made with excellent quality and has a great price. We are glad to have made the purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I was looking for!! The quality is nice and durable, fits my samsung spin 7 15.6&rdquo; perfectly!! Not really enough room to fit more than 3 notebooks or 3 textbooks at a time though.. But none the less.. Perfect for the laptop and accessories.</p>
