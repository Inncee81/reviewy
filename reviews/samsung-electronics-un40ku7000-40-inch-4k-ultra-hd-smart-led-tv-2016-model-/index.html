<h5 id="hdr-support-limited-to-only-hdmi-1">HDR support limited to only HDMI 1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is very important for people to know.ONLY HDMI port 1 will allow 4k/60hz + HDR meaning it is only this port that will allow the UHD color option (required to allow 4k/60hz and HDR) to be enabled. I have spoken with Samsung customer support and this is confirmed. The specs state it is HDMI 2.0 x3 but only HDMI 1 is full range. HDMI 2 and 3 will be limited in this regard. Only the KS line of Samsung television have full range support on all HDMI ports.My situation is a PC and PS4 Pro connected to this TV. When PS4 Pro is in HDMI 2 port, it states the TV does not support HDR. When switched to HDMI port 1, it now does. With the PS4 Pro now in HDMI 1 and my PC forced into HDMI port 2, I no longer have the capability to output 4k/60Hz and can not enable UHD Color. This means only HDMI port 1 allows full range support. Realize this before you buy.</p>

<h5 id="this-tv-is-phenomenal-i-only-buy-samsung-and-this-is-my-5th-model">This TV is phenomenal! I only buy Samsung, and this is my 5th model.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This TV is phenomenal!Do not believe the negative reviews! Most of them have to do with products arriving damaged or damaged during delivery. While I can empathize with the disappointment of receiving a brand new expensive TV in poor condition, you can&rsquo;t review performance based on seller or delivery damage.Also, there are reviews disparaging the technical respects of this TV. Some reviewers are comparing bits and bytes and talking about 4k and &ldquo;real&rdquo; HDR. First, 4k and HDR barely even exist out there in TV land, other than some streaming services, and if you stream in 4k, you had better have top quality and the fastest of the fastest of internet providers, otherwise you&rsquo;ll just be looking at endless loading circles. Second, the TVs the other reviewers are comparing against this TV are two to three times as expensive. It&rsquo;s called apples to oranges folks. Third, most 4k is in the form of Blu-Ray at this time, so if your looking for a 4k Blu-Ray player, might I suggest the newly released Xbox One S. It is a game machine, a 4k Blu-ray player, and receiver, and it costs as much as a regular single-function Blu-ray player. The PS4 Slim and the PS4 Pro do not have this capability.This TV puts you ahead of the market and technology and will stay there for some time. In other words, you won&rsquo;t be running out to buy next year&rsquo;s model or the year after that for that matter. This TV will fulfill your viewing needs for many years to come.I will say it again.This TV is phenomenal! You won&rsquo;t find a clearer or crisper 4K picture on the market AT THIS PRICE.As stated, I buy only Samsung and have done so for the past 10 years. I owned LGs and Vizios, and they turned to toast within a couple of years. Granted it&rsquo;s not a smart TV, but my oldest 51&rdquo; Samsung 1080p is still cranking. The picture is still as awesome as the day I bought it, and all the inputs are still functional. I find the HDMI inputs are often the first things to go on other models.This TV up-scales everything really well, it has every app that I think is important to most people, and it is very easy to switch quickly between Netflix, Amazon, HBOnow etc. .As far as calibrating goes, the main thing is to turn backlight and brightness down. I like the back light at 12 and brightness at 50-55, but play around with it for yourself.4k works for me through the TV or with an Xbox One S through the HDMI 2.0a inputs. Netfilx offers 4k as does Amazon and the pictures are awesome. A lot more details are noticeable on the screen than when I watched it in 1080p on my previous TV. You will see colors and details like never before. Even movies you have seen a hundred times will have new life breathed into them on this TV. You will see color where you once thought only grey existed, and the detail and clarity is truly mind-blowing.I highly recommend this Samsung TV. It has all the apps you could want, the picture from all sources will look terrific, and I actually think the sound is great too. The speakers are facing down but somewhat forward, which is much better in my opinion than rear-facing speakers.Whether the motion rate is 120 or 60, it&rsquo;s still really good. I have had no problems with blur watching sports and movies, and gaming is amazing!Yes you could find and buy a better TV, but you will spend $700 - $1000 more, and there is no need, unless you are one of those who HAS to have the top of the line. Side-by-side this TV can keep up with the best and most expensive of them.I love how smart this TV is. It recognizes the devices it&rsquo;s connected to, so instead of having to remember what HDMI 1, 2, and 3 are, it tells you Xbox, cable, etc.Additionally the remote is the smartest and easiest to use that I have ever seen. Set up the TV, attach your devices, turn everything on, point the remote at it per the instructions, and voila, the remote now controls everything. The TV, the cable box, your Xbox One or PS4, all controlled by one sleek and compact remote. Very nice, and the easiest remote I have ever used. I wish I knew how easy this remote was going to be before I bought the specialized remote for my Xbox One S. I don&rsquo;t need it! I have AT&amp;T U verse (Update 12/6/16 Recently switched to Direct TV and remote automatically adjusted and controls everything), and this remote gives me access to every function the U verse (Dircet TV) remote does with the exception of a couple specialized buttons. There is no programing to be done. It really is an amazing little device.Best settings for me: Picture Mode: Natural, Sound Mode: Movie, Picture Size 16:9 StandardPicture settings under expert settings:Backlight- 12Brightness- 50Contrast- 95Sharpness- 50Color- 55Tint- 53RDig Clean View- AutoAuto Motion Plus- Off (This will get rid of the &ldquo;Soap Opera&rdquo; or &ldquo;Handy-cam&rdquo; effect) Although for gaming I might want it set to &ldquo;Auto&rdquo;I am currently using the &ldquo;Custom&rdquo; setting with Judder reduction at 5.Dynamic Contrast- MedColor Tone- Warm1There are thousands of combinations for settings. Start with these basics and play around for yourself. You can design your own unique viewing experience.Sound settings need to be adjusted to &ldquo;movie&rdquo; or &ldquo;music&rdquo; setting to get nice sound. I prefer the movie setting. Note: If you change your picture settings to special viewing mode &ldquo;sports&rdquo; or &ldquo;game&rdquo; It will affect your sound settings so be sure to turn that mode off when not viewing sports or playing games. Also in your sound settings under &ldquo;expert settings&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find a setting called &ldquo;Auto Volume&rdquo; that should be set to normal.The built in WiFi works great and all the apps are snappy and work well. You can go to YouTube and search 4K video and see what a great picture this set is capable of. It is also HDR-10 capable and while there is not much content available there will be in the coming years. This is why TV&rsquo;s from <sup>2014</sup>&frasl;<sub>2015</sub> that were 4 grand are plummeting in price. All Samsung 2016 TV&rsquo;s will be HDR compliant (this one included).The stand is a nice and solid one-piece, which makes it easy to find a stand to put it on VS. the double leg stands that require extra long TV stands to set upon.All in all I&rsquo;m happy with this television for the price. It may not have all the extra fancy settings that other models may have but for 90% of the population (videophile&rsquo;s aside) this TV is more than enough for everyday needs. I only buy Samsung, and this is my 5th model. I have two 65&rdquo; including this one, one 51&rdquo;, one 43&rdquo;, and a 40&rdquo;. They are all amazing, and the 4K picture on the two newer models blows me away.You will not be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="too-smart-for-its-own-good">Too Smart for Its Own Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a remarkable TV but because of its auto-adjust features it can produce a &ldquo;Soap Opera&rdquo; effect making everything, including old movies look like they were shot on a handy cam. Fortunately, there is an easy fix though it is counter-intuitive, you have to dial back some features. Under the picture settings, go to Expert settings, and turn off all the auto features, auto motion plus, digital clean and film. There are finer tweaks you can make and if you google &ldquo;soap opera effect&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll stumble upon some really detailed, excellent parameter settings, but just turning off those three things was close enough for me, and perhaps changing to movie mode. So, why buy a TV that you have to dial back? Well because the technology is ahead of the medium available but you&rsquo;ll be there and the price of this is not significantly greater than a similar size smart 1080p. And, for broadcasts, such as an increasing number from Netflix and ESPN, and anything that is all digital and designed to be crystal clear, this TV is amazing. The smart features are flawless and I set up the apps in a few minutes and was able to move a Roku 3 to another room. I&rsquo;m living with the sound for now. It&rsquo;s ok. Not rich like my plasma, but then that&rsquo;s a 100 lb. TV, this is an anorexic wafer. This TV is lighter than some pictures hanging on my walls so there is not much room for booming, rich speakers. That said, it does a very good job with what it has to work with just not a home theater level job..Everything about this TV reminds me of the first CD player I bought when most CDs sounded worse than LPs because you heard everything and it sounded unnatural. In time this was corrected with remastering and was far superior but there was a transition phase. The same can be said of its remote, it isn&rsquo;t quite voice activated AI but it&rsquo;s getting there. It would have been nice if they had included a dumb remote along with there nifty Bang and Olufsen looking super mod remote but I&rsquo;m getting used to it. Mostly I use this TV like a monitor so remotes don&rsquo;t concern me that much as I use the original remote once the source is selected. Still, it needs work. You might think this sounds more like a 4 star review but I can&rsquo;t bring myself to do that because the picture is that good, the TV that light and smart, and forward-ready, so maybe more accurately 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> stars but an excellent TV for the price that is very versatile, semi future-proof and very customizable.</p>
