<ul>
<li>Rapid-T Valve: changes from Presta to Schrader valves with a simple switch, seals strong so there are no annoying leaks</li>
<li>Includes: glueless emergency puncture kit so you’ll never have to worry about being left stranded with a flat tire</li>
<li>Inflates to 160 PSI: strong steel barrel and reinforced handle, this bicycle pump can easily reach 160 PSI</li>
<li>Accurage Guage: this cycle pump has been built for PSI precision and easy reading</li>
<li>Includes: sports ball inflation needle, and attachment for inflating inflatable devices like pool toys</li>
</ul>

<p>Presta and Schrader Compatible</p>

<p>This floor pump is the perfect lightweight performance bicycle pump for competitive
and social riders. Designed with the special &ldquo;Rapid T-Valve&rdquo; it switches between Presta &amp; Schrader valves with ease.
The connection fits perfectly, avoiding annoying leaks.</p>

<p>High Pressure Pumping to 160 PSI</p>

<p>With a strong steel barrel, wide foot nylon base plate for stability and ergonomically designed handle,
our floor pump inflates to high pressure of 160 PSI, a high performance road bike pump for all riders.</p>

<p>The longer barrel allows for larger volume of air to be pumped with each stroke, resulting in faster inflation.</p>

<p>Accurate Pressure Gauge</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more annoying than a bike pump with a gauge that&rsquo;s faulty.</p>

<p>The large gauge is easy to read when pumping, no more squinting at small annoying gauges</p>

<p>Includes Glueless Puncture Kit</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all had an unfortunate flat at the worst possible time. We include our glueless puncture kit with your floor pump.</p>

<p>This pocket sized kit is lightweight and requires no glue at all, simply locate the area of the puncture,
rough the surface with the sandpaper provided, apply a patch and inflate.</p>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-amazing-pumping-is-so-much-easier-and-more-efficient">This thing is amazing. Pumping is so much easier and more efficient &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is amazing. Pumping is so much easier and more efficient than my last pump, and the thing seems high quality so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll get any tears (like my last pump did).I dig the locking feature on the nozzle. You put the nozzle into your tire&rsquo;s valve, and then you flip a switch and it locks in place perfectly. On my old pump, you&rsquo;d hear a hissing noise so air would escape and you&rsquo;d have to fiddle with it before it stopped, and even then it&rsquo;d still hiss a bit. No air escapes with this pump.I dig the PSI gauge. While pumping I used to have to feel the tire every so often to check how much more air it needed, but with this pump you know exactly when to stop pumping. You feel when your tire is perfectly full of air and then note the PSI reading. For me that was 70 PSI. So from thereon, I&rsquo;d just pump the tire straight to 70 without stopping. No need to feel the tire every so often. You know it&rsquo;s perfectly full at 70 PSI (or at least that&rsquo;s the number for my tire).Great pump. Worth the money.</p>

<h5 id="best-pump-for-a-daily-commuter-hands-down-amazing">Best pump for a daily commuter, hands down! Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me preface by saying I am in no way being coerced to rate this pump. I am just so upset with my broken Joeblow Max that all I can do is sing this pump&rsquo;s praises. It is phenomenal!Pros: Small, compact, and lightweight for a full size floor pumpRock solid design, smooth operation3 footed base - this is genius, all floor pumps should be designed this way no exceptions, prevents so much wobbleI love the idea of the rubber grips on the base, don&rsquo;t know if they help but I haven&rsquo;t slipped yet!Large, easy to read pressure gaugeThe presta valves lock in like a lifer con! Excellent seal! Nothing like it, no leaks or hisses, expertly designedFreakin 15 year warranty! are you kidding me!? Hopefully they never go out of business. The package on some of these pumps does have a printing error stating &ldquo;5 year warranty.&rdquo; As stated by other consumers, customer service will confirm that it is a 15 year warranty, yippee!Comes with a bonus patch kitCons: Honestly I can find only one. I can&rsquo;t really say that this is a big deal but I&rsquo;m anal retentive so it bothers me. There is no internal cushioning at the top and bottom of the piston. If you are vigorously pumping away you will feel the plunger slam into the top and bottom of chamber as you pump. You can always ease off or feel for where the top and bottom are but then you are cheating yourself of a full stroke and less air compressed per stroke. As I said, I&rsquo;m anal about details and this really isn&rsquo;t a big deal. I would recommend to the manufacturers to add some cushioning in piston to their next design to remedy this.I would also like to add that I am a daily commuting cyclist and go through several flats or blowouts a month. I also live in Alabama which ranks dead last in state wide bicycle infrastructure. This means I spend a lot of time dodging cars trying to kill me and being bullied into the gutter. Cyclists like myself need a pump that they can rely on. A pump that connects quickly to the valve, securely, effortlessly, and pumps efficiently. This pump is all that and more! I will update this review if I have any problems with it in the near future.</p>

<h5 id="decent-pump-for-the-price">Decent pump for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With all the very positive reviews, my expectations where probably elevated higher than the should have been. My previous pump was a really nice Bontrager that someone recently helped themselves to - it was very tall, solid and worked well, therefore my bar was set high.The valve works fine - it is a little cumbersome to lock it down, but they all are. I do like the large gauge which seems accurate in accordance to my digital Topeak gauge.The plastic base feels flimsy and flexes a lot.For $36, I would still say it is a decent buy - I did not want to spend another $100 on a pump; given that, I&rsquo;m sure this pump will work fine.</p>

<h5 id="initial-review-just-received">Initial review&ndash;just received.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this pump to maintain the tires on my hybrid road bike that has 60-80psi tires. As soon as I received the pump I wanted to give it a try as it was a replacement for a compressor that had a very poorly designed valve and kept leaking air while inflating a bicycle tire.My first impression of this pump has been only positive&ndash;the small repair kit is a nice bonus (it&rsquo;s about the size of four quarters stacked up).+ two-way valve was easy to attach to my Schrader valves and most importantly&ndash;it stayed secure until the lever was turned to the center to detach&ndash;when it came off easily and didn&rsquo;t leak much pressure when detaching.+ the pump had good action&ndash;the foot rest and handle are comfortable, sturdy, and well designed.+ the gauge is easy to read when pumping the tires+ to get my front tire (flat) up to 80 psi only took 20 strokes of the pump. I have road tires, so it would likely require more strokes to inflate a mountain/all-terrain tire, but nonetheless it&rsquo;s better than other pumps I&rsquo;ve tried.+ the hose clips are located on either side of the handle&ndash;which is a good design so the hose can be looped over the handle and clipped on the other side to keep the handle secured in it&rsquo;s down position for storage.+all-steel barrel design feels sturdy but not too heavyMy first impression is very positive and I&rsquo;ve seen similar quality pumps from other bike supply companies for about $20 more.</p>

<p>Very good pump, I&rsquo;m no expert and picked this pump based on its price and many great reviews. I&rsquo;d have given it 5 stars but really have nothing to compare it to.</p>

<p>Great product for bikes and sports balls. Good pressure and most important it does not allow air to seep out when you stop pumping and disconnect which is why we needed to replace&hellip;</p>
