<h5 id="great-head-unit-for-the-price">Great Head Unit for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to put in my 1998 Jeep Cherokee. Installation was pretty straight forward and I would say standard for aftermarket radio installs. I didn&rsquo;t use the manual much other than for wiring color designation.I&rsquo;ve had it in for about 3 weeks now and it&rsquo;s been great! I love the bluetooth feature; the main reason I bought the radio. It automatically connects to my cell phone every time I get in my Jeep, turn it on and it starts off playing music right where I left off last time I was in the Jeep.I installed the microphone on the steering column and hid the wire behind the instrument trim panel. I love the BT phone feature because I get a lot of calls for work when I&rsquo;m driving down the road. All I have to do is push the phone button on the radio and it pauses my music and connects my phone call through the speakers in the car. I asked people how I sounded and they said they could tell I was on speakerphone, but could hear me ok. I like the fact that it has a USB port on the front to charge my phone or possibly play music off of a USB drive. I haven&rsquo;t tried the cd player yet, since cds are kind of out of date and everything has gone digital, but I would say it works fine.The only complaint I have, as others said, is that when sunlight is on the display it&rsquo;s very hard to read the display; I wish they would or could have put some type of coating on the lens to reduce the glare. i didn&rsquo;t try to turn the brightness all the way up on the display because I didn&rsquo;t want it being super bright at night time.I am thinking of ordering another one of these to replace the radio that is working fine in my 2001 Camaro just because the current radio doesn&rsquo;t have bluetooth or a USB port.If this is the price range you are looking to spend on a nice head unit, don&rsquo;t hesitate to get it; it&rsquo;s a great bang for the buck purchase!</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product.</h5>

<p>When I got the CD player I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it would work very well or what. But after installing it in my Ford Ranger I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way now. All the different options this CD player comes with is really nice like especially with Bluetooth once I start up my truck my phone automatically connects do it and if I want to listen to iHeartRadio and I have it open on my phone it starts playing it. And also if I get a phone call I have not had any problem with it so far people can hear me fine and I can hear them fine. All-around I love the CD player the only thing that I find with it is that there are a lot of settings so make sure that you read the manual that comes with it see you know how you want it set up and how it works but other than that I give it five stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the Pioneer DEH-X6900BT. We&rsquo;ve had it for about six months and are generally satisfied. It&rsquo;s installed in our RV, where it drives six speakers. I&rsquo;ll just talk about what I don&rsquo;t like because it is just a car stereo.Don&rsquo;t lose the manual, and do read it. The menu system isn&rsquo;t complicated, but it is deep and not intuitive. I poked something in the menu and made the back two speakers not work, took a bit to get them back.The power button is also the mode button, so I often change modes instead of turning the radio off. And it cycles through all the modes to get back to radio, but you can turn it off from any mode. Would be nice to be able to disable modes that we don&rsquo;t use, like Pandora.Bluetooth phone access doesn&rsquo;t work well in our RV, with our phones. We can hear the other end, they can&rsquo;t hear us. YMMV. Playing music via bluetooth works well.The display is dim in daylight, even set for max intensity.All told, even with my negatives, it is a good radio. No regrets buying it</p>

<h5 id="great-not-excellent">Great, not excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great stereo, but some Android phones do not work on USB. I can&rsquo;t even charge my phone. That is the only issue I have.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bus-party">Bus party</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It does everything that I could want in a single DIN car head unit. I haven&rsquo;t tried Bluetooth yet but if it works well, I can&rsquo;t imagine why anyone would spend any more than this. I put it in a school bus and installation took less than and hour. Right now I&rsquo;m running 4 6x9&rdquo;s in boxes - a killer combo. The real kicker was the 3 RCA outs for when I add multiple amps, subs and extra speakers. My only complaint is that the menu options seem a little wonky and unclear. Meh. The fewer confusing buttons plastered across the face, the better, so no biggie. Buy it for your bus too!!</p>

<h5 id="great-item-good-price-can-t-beat-it">Great item,good price can&rsquo;t beat it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Saved alot of money ordering it and getting someone to install it saved me about $100 all together works great the price is very good only $80Most places for the same thing wanted $120+ of the radio has alot of features a lot of customizable sound settings and volume settings has a lot of music sources Bluetooth wireless connection Bluetooth phone calls that connect to your contacts shows on display of the radio you can change the display the various ways to show different things has Pandora and Spotify connectivity ready has USB and auxilary will buy again thanks again for having a good price and a good quality item</p>

<p>Very good car stereo, can connect by Bluetooth to two devices.Because it was bought from USA to Israel does not receive parity radio stations.מערכת מצוינת למי שרוכש בארה&rdquo;ב לישראל שידע שהרדיו לא קולט תחנות זוגיות&hellip; (בארה&rdquo;ב אין )</p>

<h5 id="upgrading-for-newer-technology">Upgrading for newer technology</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a 10-year-old Alpine stereo I bought so I could use my iPod Nano using the stereo controls and just put the iPod in the glove box. Worked fantastic for many years but I guess the technology just couldn&rsquo;t keep up finally making the functions useless. I decided to upgrade so I could still use my iPod plus my Kindle and my smartphone. Looked into another Alpine and they were expensive and saw this Pioneer for a lot less. Everything works, even the library downloads. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is that the inputs are on the front of the stereo whereas the old Alpine had the iPod cable out the back so it could be easily hidden in the glove box. But the Pioneer does have a USB and audio inputs so I just have to go get used to the ugly wires hanging out the front. I unplug when not using and put the devices away or in the glove box. Maybe the next incarnation will be a multi-port connection from the rear to the glove box, I hope. I do like it though. Hope it will last 10 years like the Alpine did.</p>
