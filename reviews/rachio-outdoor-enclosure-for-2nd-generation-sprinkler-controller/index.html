<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="hardwire-rachio-finally">Hardwire Rachio Finally</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product. Allows me to hardwire my Rachio 2nd Gen. I was going to go with the other guy WIFI controller, then Rachio came out with 2nd Gen. Now this is great. Highly recommended.What I don&rsquo;t understand is the lack of pictures from Rachio. Why don&rsquo;t they take more pictures and show them in details on the site? I was wondering how do these work. Why can&rsquo;t they take a picture that shows the plug in there? Rachio! Have you seen Apple website about their products? A good idea to copy them, don&rsquo;t you think? &lsquo;.Anyways, love my Rachio 2nd Gen and this enclosure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-design-configuration-and-ease-of-use-no-more-watering-your-lawn-s-on-rainy-days">Love the design, configuration and ease of use. No more watering your lawn(s) on rainy days.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it so far. Was able to install myself in a really short time frame. Easy to hook up and connect. Love that you can set a local or nearby weather station, in order to get a more accurate configuration. The defaults save myself a ton of time and water, by not worrying about sprinklers going off on or following a rainy day.The website and information provided is nice and clean, app functions really well.It may bother some that you don&rsquo;t have buttons on the front to manually manipulate your zones. I&rsquo;ve not had an issue with it. Landscaper who tends to my yard can use the landscaper config on app, or manually turn on/off at the valves.Minor suggestions is that when setting up configuration of watering zones, I wish it provided better guidelines for a landscaping novice. Setting the right type of soil or nozzle type took a little research online for myself.Lastly, I really hope they get the relationship with SmartThings figured out so that integration can happen. This is my only major complaint at this point.</p>

<h5 id="does-the-job-with-one-moderately-annoying-installation-quirk">Does the job, with one moderately annoying installation quirk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Another reviewer mentioned this and I thought, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s minor, stop bellyaching.&rdquo; And then I ran into the same problem with my sprinkler wires not being long enough to reach from the input hole in the bottom of the enclosure to the connection points. I ended up having to drill a hole in the center of the underside of the box to run the conduit up through for my wires to reach. I reckon most people don&rsquo;t have a ton of slack in their wires, so it would be nice if there were punchouts in the center and over to the right where the hole is currently, so you can choose the best one for your setup. It really was an unexpected additional step that would have made installation a lot easier. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s fine.Oh, also, be sure and understand what extra stuff you might need to do this install. I read all the info on it and thought I needed to buy extra parts for my hardwired installation, but ended up not needing them. So just study that carefully before you order, since those extra parts are VERY overpriced on Amazon, but also hard to find locally. We have a hardwired electrical connection and didn&rsquo;t end up needing anything additional to install it (besides the aforementioned hole drill bit).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-expected-rachio-enclosure">Better Than Expected Rachio Enclosure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great addition to the Rachio 2 Controller which is much better than the description would lead you to believe. I knew I needed it, so neglected to read the reviews&hellip;something I normally always do. As a result I wasted time thinking about how I&rsquo;d wire up the new controller which is replacing my existing hardwired Rain Bird controller. I was pleasantly surprised to see there is an outlet in the enclosure and plenty of room to mount the &ldquo;brick&rdquo; power supply. As a result it was a simple matter to make a neat wiring job. I agree with another reviewer that Rachio ought to show more pictures and promote their excellent product a bit more. This is an excellent product for anyone mounting their Gen 2 Rachio outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-enclosure-for-a-great-sprinkler-controller">Great enclosure for a great sprinkler controller.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rachio Gen2 fit perfectly in the enclosure. It can be wired to an electrical outlet due to an outlet being built-in the box. You can just plug your big black power adapter for the Rachio controller right inside the box.The Rachio connected to my wireless network without any problems and I set it up in ten minutes all from my Android phone. I love being able to get alerts about water usage and zone activation as well as start/stop watering remotely. If you want complete control of your sprinkler system, no matter where you are, Rachio of the best money can buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-designed-and-good-value">Well designed and good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this enclosure to keep my Rachio controller out of the weather and was really surprised at the quality of the unit. The controller uses a power converter - one of those little black boxes you plug in with a wire to the controller. This box is designed with an outlet inside the box to fit that power converter so that it is also out of the weather. This makes the enclosure kind of large, but its worth the space. The only complaint I have about the enclosure is that in order to use the internal electrical outlet, you have to wire in a regular power cord and that&rsquo;s not included. The recommendation was to use the cord from the old controller, which assumes you are upgrading. While I was upgrading, I wanted to run the new system in phantom mode in parallel with the old system to make sure it was going to do the job. So, I bought a power cord at the local hardware store for a few bucks. Its not a problem, but Rachio might want to consider including the power cord with the unit. It would raise the cost slightly, but the cost as is is really a good deal considering what you actually get for your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-very-impressed-for-the-price">Not very impressed for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good idea, but I expected a better app for the price. Can&rsquo;t copy/paste settings across zones, so be prepared to enter things up to 16 times. Also, not a quick easy way to cycle through select zones for testing. Mine has yet to adjust watering for rain, even though I have tried two different weather stations. I read plenty of comparisons before purchase, and if this is one of the best made (as they claim) the others must be awful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="options">Options!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This enclosure is a must for outdoor application of the Rachio Smart Sprinkler. The enclosure allows you to run the plug from the Rachio out of a hole in the enclosure OR to a receptacle inside the box and then do a direct wiring to exterior power source. I love that I had the option. I ended up running the plug out to a GFCI outlet. But, if I want to later hardwire it from some reason, that can be easily done. Also, good looking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-good-enclosure-for-your-rachio">Really good enclosure for your Rachio</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am really pleased at how well this enclosure fits the device, and the built in outlet for the power adapter is easy to wire and has ample room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-design">Good design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as stated. A good cover for your Rachio sprinkler unit. The only thing you may have to add is couplings to make it water tight on the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing wrong with it, one star for not being included with the clock.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-product-and-worked-right-out-of-the-box">this is a great product and worked right out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is a great product and worked right out of the box. It has been working since, and is saving me a ton of water!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rachio enclosure was what I needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thanks-rachio-for-giving-us-two-great-products">Thanks Rachio for giving us two great products.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received this cover and it have been a saving grace, I did not have to drill holes into my new house, didn&rsquo;t have purchase and install 300 plus feet of sprinkler wire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great, love the phone access/control. Love it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Returned as didn&rsquo;t install outside. Produced appeared to be high quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="smart-product">Smart product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works like a champ , the app is well designed and the alerts work well . I used mine with a rain sensor but even without it performs well with local weather info.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-fit-for-the-controller">Perfect fit for the controller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect fit for putting your controller outside. My only complaint is that you do have to take off the front cover of your controller for it to fit nicely.</p>
