Reduce dropped calls, increase 3G data rates in weak signal areas and originate calls from dreaded &ldquo;dead spots&rdquo; with the Sleek Cell Phone Signal Cradle Booster from Wilson Electronics. The Sleek and its external vehicular antenna increase any phone&rsquo;s output power to the cell site while improving its ability to hear signals it normally cannot, keeping you more reliably connected. It extends the calling range and signal strength of any phone on any North American cell service provider&rsquo;s network (except Nextel/iDEN).</p>

<p>Built into the Sleek cradle is a Wilson bi-directional signal amplifier and battery charging port. The cradle is ideal for hands free operation in conjunction with your headset or Bluetooth device. Designed for simple set up, the Sleek can be easily moved from vehicle to vehicle.</p>

<p>How The Sleek Works
The roof-mounted antenna receives the phone&rsquo;s signal from the cell tower and sends it to the Sleek cradle via cable. The signal is then boosted by the Sleek&rsquo;s built-in amplifier and then transmitted to the cell phone by its built-in antenna. The process is then repeated in reverse to send a boosted cell phone signal back to the cell tower. The Sleek operates on both the 800 MHz (cellular) and 1900 MHz (PCS) frequency bands, and meets all FCC and Industry Canada technical specifications.</p>

<p>Installing The Sleek
First, attach the outside magnetic mount antenna, which captures the weak cell tower signal
Second, plug-in the Sleek&rsquo;s power adapter into the cigarette lighter
Third, attach the cable from the outside antenna to the dash-mounted Sleek cradle
Fourth, place phone in the cradle of the Sleek and connect with your wired hands-free device or Bluetooth headset

<h5 id="works-better-than-i-dreamed-even-better-than-wi-fi-connectivity">Works Better than I Dreamed - Even better than Wi-Fi Connectivity.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got an AT&amp;T iPhone 7 with unlimited data to use as a hot spot at work since I no longer have a Wi-Fi connection. I bought Wilson&rsquo;s Cell Phone Extender and office kit system because I found out I had extremely limited or no service connectivity which did not allow access to the internet, send or receive email or even text. Deeply disappointed, I just about returned my iPhone but thought I&rsquo;d give Wilson&rsquo;s system a try. I was very skeptical because it was the cheapest cell phone extender system out there, and even more so since I didn&rsquo;t have access to a window at my desk cubicle, but heck, I thought any service is better than none, so I gave it a try.I was shocked when I set up the antenna at the top of my cubicle, plugged in the system and inserted my iPhone. I instantly went from no service to three bars. I activated my iPhone Hot Spot and used my iPad to email, text, use the internet and even stream video from my home DirecTV DVR without a hiccup - It was amazing, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with this system, especially since I didn&rsquo;t even have to mount the system on a window. For less than half the price I was able to use my iPhone as a Hot Spot, connect my iPad to it and use it even better than when I had Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>

<h5 id="nothing-in-the-country-compared-to-wilson-electric">Nothing in the country, compared to Wilson electric</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>10 years ago I purchased a Wilson signal booster when I moved to a house out in the country where I could sometimes get a text message out. It was amazing. I went from almost nothing to making calls. That device plugged into the audio port of the phone. This was before the smart phone and 4g networks, but still either years later with my smart phone when I needed it. Once we got Internet and a signal booster it was no longer needed.Again I&rsquo;ve moved to a place off grid. It&rsquo;s only 4 miles out of town but there is no electricity or Internet yet. I can sometimes get a text message to send, but generally have to walk a few hundred yards up the driveway to do it. I hooked this device up and nothing changed. I drove up to where I can generally send a text and was unable to send anything. I ended up driving 2 miles before a text would send. That further than I&rsquo;ve ever had to go before. If anything this device made things worse.It came with a teeny tiny little pathetic antenna. I don&rsquo;t see where I should have to buy the upgraded antenna to make it work. If that&rsquo;s what makes it work, then that&rsquo;s what they should sell with it. I&rsquo;ll drive out to the old place, where the old signal booster used to work and try it there and a few other places where I occasionally get signal but it isn&rsquo;t always reliable.</p>

<h5 id="works-but-not-for-skyping">Works but not for skyping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We live out in the woods and even though we have a landline wifi, it is not good enough to Skype with. I bought this Wilson cell signal enhancer to try to get my cell phone signal up to use my hotspot. My signal went from 1 bar to 4 so I am happy with that and it does what is says. However, it is still 1x not 4G so it is still not strong enough for skype. It will be very useful for when we travel and it was easy to set up and use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">Wow!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I rarely review items, but this I can&rsquo;t pass on. When I got my first cell phone I was hoping that I&rsquo;d be able to drop my land line and just have one phone bill. However, I live in &ldquo;the boonies&rdquo; and cell reception is iffy, so that idea was tabled. I&rsquo;ve upgraded my cell phone a few times and now have a smartphone. I love the phone, but my home signal is still the same. Periodically I&rsquo;d check to see if booster technology had evolved to where I could benefit at a RESONABLE price. When I saw the ad for this product it sounded too good to be true. I&rsquo;m a skeptic, but willing to give somethings a try. When I found it on Amazon I figured I&rsquo;d give it a try and if it didn&rsquo;t work, then I&rsquo;d return it (returns to Amazon have always been hassle free for me&hellip;). Well, no worry - IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED!!! With the home adapter kit I now have 4 full bars on my BB Storm. Before I was lucky to have one bar. And I&rsquo;m NOT exaggerating. The only downside is that I have to use my bluetooth headset because the phone has to remain in the cradle, which would make it pretty awkward to use. But, for me, that&rsquo;s no big problem, as I&rsquo;m used to using bluetooth when I&rsquo;m traveling, so it isn&rsquo;t a deal breaker. This will be my LAST month of paying for a separate land line (in 4 months this product will have paid for itself). I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who lives in cell phone fringe reception areas and would like to drop their land line. Oh, and it&rsquo;s simple to shift it into the car for on-the-road signal boosting, where it also shines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 Dec 15 update - Oops! Ordered the wrong one, this is the 3G version of the booster, and will not help your 4g signal at all. You want model #460107 for the 4g functionality, Sent this one back for the &ldquo;new version&rdquo; of the cradle now that Wilson has changed their name to &ldquo;weBoost&rdquo; (what a god-awfully DUMB name). So I&rsquo;ll be reviewing that in the near future.This is my 4th one. One at the house, one at the vacation home in the boonies, one at the office and one for Mom and Pops out in the boonies as well. Best thing is that they are all portable and work just as well in the car. Awesome for those road trips to use the phone as a hot spot to keep the little urchins from getting cranky without their on-line stimulant. My oldest one is over 5 years old now and it still works like a charm.</p>

<h5 id="takes-a-weak-worthless-signal-and-makes-it-very-strong-awesome">Takes a weak worthless signal and makes it very strong. Awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic product that clearly works extremely well. Super simple to set up and placement of the antenna is very forgiving. I even use the product indoors (the power is just a typical USB cord that can plug into your cell phone wall charger) and works great.You can see the cell signal improve by going to the Settings -&gt; More - &gt; About Device -&gt; Status and look to see what your signal strength is and watch it jump right up. This is more accurate than just looking at the bars on the top of the screen.People state that when it works people love it and when there&rsquo;s not enough signal to amplify then its just junk.I would imagine the secret on knowing whether this will work for you or not is seeing your strength currently. If its over -110dB it&rsquo;s probably not going to work. Or if you can&rsquo;t make any calls, ever (not just static ridden calls that drop), then it&rsquo;s probably not going to work for you. Otherwise if you shows hints of having occasional signal it&rsquo;s worth a shot!</p>
