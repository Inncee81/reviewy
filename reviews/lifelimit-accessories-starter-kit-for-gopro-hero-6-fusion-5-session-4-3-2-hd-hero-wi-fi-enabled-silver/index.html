<blockquote>
<p>Short Review: If you are in the market for some accessories for your new GoPro, don&rsquo;t hesitate to buy this product! This is the BEST bundle I could find at this price point.I am brand new to the GoPro, and I, like many others I&rsquo;m sure, was overwhelmed by the number of kits on Amazon. There are literally hundreds of kits claiming to be the best, but they all lacked something wanted. One would have everything but the monopod. Another would have it all except the floating hand grip. C&rsquo;mon! I was growing tired and on the verge of giving up on the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; kit when I discovered LifeLimit. They looked professional and seemed to include everything I wanted.The package arrived quickly and on-time. The contents come in a nice, blue bag (see pictures). The bag is a nice touch that many other bundles lacked. It&rsquo;s professional enough that I would take it out in public but also cheap enough that I won&rsquo;t be sad if I leave it somewhere one day. Ha!I opened it up to find the parts seperated into Ziploc bags, nice touch. As another reviewer noted, there is a hint of plastic-ish-sorta smell. It went away after a few hours of being out of the bag. No worries. Nothing was broken, and I was happy.I have since used every item in this kit and can say it&rsquo;s great! The suction cup mount is really strong and will make for some great shots in &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; places like your windshield or elsewhere. The head-strap is really nice. It WILL go large enough for your head, so don&rsquo;t get frustrated if it is way too small at first. The chest mount seems really nice and has worked well so far. It has various adjustments and will accommodate most body-types. The miscellaneous pieces including screws, mounts, and adhesive pads all work.The monopod is quite nice measuring at 8.5&rdquo; when fully collapsed and just shy of 43&rdquo; when fully extended. It is sturdy enough that I&rsquo;ll use it and trust it with my GoPro, but I won&rsquo;t be holding it off the edge of the Empire State Building. That&rsquo;s for sure. It does have a strap that you can put around your wrist for added safety, which is a nice touch. The floating hand grip is a wonderfully visible and floats at water level no problem. Like the monopod, it has a wrist strap for added safety. It feels secure. I&rsquo;ll be trusting it for sure. The handlebar mount is great and seems sturdy. It can be removed by taking out one screw, which is nice. There&rsquo;s also this clamp with nice teeth on it that might be really helpful to some. I used it to attach my camera to backpack strap when I don&rsquo;t feel like wearing a camera.Overall, this is a fantastic kit that will make anyone happy. It has everything you need to get &ldquo;started.&rdquo; I say that in quotes because you still need a Micro SD Card and some batteries and maybe a case, but you get what I mean!See attached pictures for full tour. There are simply too many products for one shot! Ha! If you have any questions, please ask them!</p>

<h5 id="great-accessory-kit-for-gopro-action-cameras">Great Accessory Kit for GoPro/Action Cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, let me say that I really love the fact that all of these accessories fit into the included blue bag. I know that sounds like a simple thing, but most of the other vendors that sell these types of kits don&rsquo;t include anything to carry them in. That said, you end up dumping them into a ziplock bag, which doesn&rsquo;t look all that nice when you&rsquo;re packing for an adventure.As far as the accessories themselves, I like that Lifelimit included a good amount of the 3M adhesives and mounts. I&rsquo;m also a big fan of the floating handle. I&rsquo;ve used this item on snorkeling trips in Mexico, Roatan, Aruba, Curacao, and many other spots in the Caribbean. It&rsquo;s a very simple design, but it works very well when you attach it to your wrist even if you are not using the GoPro floaty on the back of your camera.The head strap is nice and comfortable. I used it with both my GoPro Hero 4 Silver and my new GoPro Hero 6 Black and it kept the cameras completely secure.All in all, this is a great Buy. As you can see, I trust even my most expensive GoPro equipment with these accessories and have had no issues.Great job Lifelimit!</p>

<h5 id="so-many-pieces-i-ll-never-use-them-all">So many pieces I&rsquo;ll never use them all.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a complete kit for anyone who owns a go pro or any other action camera thats built similar to a go pro. This kit has multiple mounting clamps and devices , selfie stick and harnesses just to name a few. I can always use the mounts that have the sticky side tape for all my mounts and angles that help me take great videos and pictures. For $20 this kit is a heck of deal and the quality of everything is the same or better then the items that came with my go pro from factory. This kit is going to last me a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-deal">Awesome deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This came with the blue bag and it has everything i needed for my gopro. Its reay good deal for how much we&rsquo;ve paid. Everything inside the blue bag is very useful. We love to used our gopro and this kit is the great deal for us. If you buy one of the item might be the cost of this kit. And everything inside are good quality.</p>

<p>So many options for connections and wearing options for the GoPro in this kit. I bought it for a trip and it packed down nicely. It has all the pieces needed to go adventuring with your GoPro. Most are pretty high quality despite being packaged in a pack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased for the original GoPro Hero (ancient, I know) but still fits every accessory nonetheless. Wanted some mounts to use on an upcoming vacation and you cannot beat the amount of goods you get for this price. The entire package is less than half the price of a GoPro brand selfie stick. Yes it is a cheaper plastic but it does the job and secures your camera. The blue bag keeping all the pieces together is super convenient too. Excited to try all these out and would definitely recommend</p>

<p>Best $20 I&rsquo;ve spent in a long time. Tons of useful items for my GoPro kits. I&rsquo;ve even given parts of it away and repurchased the entire kit.Great value and bang for the buck. (I&rsquo;m like Nasa sometimes, redundancy is key)</p>
