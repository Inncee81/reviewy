<h5 id="works-well-with-minor-limitations">Works well with minor limitations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After more than a decade of substandard home audio, I was finally able to find a skilled (marine electronics!) technician to repair the awesome Aragon amplifier-driven system my wife bought back in the 90&rsquo;s when we were making money.This led to a new problem: most of her CD&rsquo;s are faux-pop-jazz from the 90&rsquo;s&hellip;Fourplay, Michael Franks, and so on. You can see why her delight in being able to use her system was actually a net-negative for lovers of fine music.Over the last decade, I&rsquo;ve built an outstanding collection of playlists that provide hours of bliss, but it&rsquo;s mostly stored on my phone and my desktop. The best desktop powered speakers are no match for what we were again able to enjoy.We tried RCA cables out of the headphone jack on my phone, but the output was limited and we couldn&rsquo;t get enough input to make the stereo project.I bought the HomeSpot device on a whim for about $25.This has allowed us to listen to great music during dinner, as I&rsquo;m able to have the phone with us about 20 feet away and control what plays and what needs to be skipped.Sound quality is just okay, since we&rsquo;re talking about Bluetooth and MP3 &ndash; but it&rsquo;s still better than Spyro Gyra on CD and it&rsquo;s better than the powered desktop speakers we were using.I&rsquo;d recommend this for anyone with an old-school stereo system that sounds better than any modern &ldquo;sound bar.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="you-must-reset-the-device">you must reset the device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update-Followed the reset procedures as recommended by the seller and it appears most of my reception issues are gone. As other reviewers noted, you get about 20 ft away before it starts to drop out (presumably a Bluetooth 4.0 issue). It still makes loud thumping noises (could be my amp or phone) when switching tracks or pausing/resuming, and it still does NOT reconnect to my iPhone 6 when powering up but that&rsquo;s a minor annoyance. Minor enough that I cancelled my RMA and I&rsquo;m going to keep playing with these devices. Installed one into my suitcase turned into a portable speaker so will be doing some good testing now that the weather is becoming warmer. YOU MUST RESET THE DEVICE.Bought 3 as Amazon Deal of the Day, hoping at least 1 was good. Sound is good when playing, as long as you don&rsquo;t connect the USB power to a computer (and speakers hanging off that computer). Skipping tracks or pausing causes loud popping noises. Pausing audio more than 5 seconds causes it to unpair from phone. Out of all 3: none re-paired with last device on power up, none made it more than 7ft away without losing audio. Tested on 2 different iPhone 6&rsquo;s. Device was sitting on top of an empty desk with no objects around it. iPhones were held in the palm of the hand and direct line of sight. I was hoping to have this in my garage hooked to old PC speakers, with my phone in my pocket. At this limited distance I might as well plug my phone into the speakers and leave it on the shelf, therefore I&rsquo;m returning all 3. Really had high hopes given all the great reviews.</p>

<h5 id="mixed-results-potentially-not-recommend-for-apple-users">Mixed results, potentially not recommend for Apple users</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written many Amazon reviews, and it&rsquo;s quit rare for me to not recommend what I am writing about. Mostly because I do a lot of research before buying things, and I typically end up with exactly what I require. Not so with this HomeSpot Bluetooth Audio receiver.I&rsquo;ve had no end of trouble with it on Apple devices. I&rsquo;ve tried it with:* iPhone 5* iPhone 6* MacBook Pro 17&rdquo; (mid 2010)* MacBook Air 11&rdquo; (latest)In my experience, it&rsquo;s been a pain in the proverbial arse on all of these Apple devices. It refuses to connect with the MBP. It is fickle with connecting (and staying connected) with the iPhones. Each time I try to connect the iPhones, I typically I have delete the connection/pairing every time, and then repair them. That in itself can be tricky, but at least it tends to stay connected until I terminate the connection. But to then reconnect, again I&rsquo;ll have to remove the pairing completely from the iPhone, and start from scratch. The MacBook Air has better luck, but not 100% success.I also have a Nexus 4 and a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8. I have better success with these devices. It should be noted that both are running Cyanogenmod (non-stock android). They connect and play fairly decently. So, based on my experience, I&rsquo;d say this device has decent compatibility with Android devices, and very questionable compatibility with Apple devices.If it was just on my Apple MacBookPro I experience these issues, I might be inclined to think it&rsquo;s the computer that&rsquo;s at fault. That&rsquo;s actually the only Apple device I own, and I was tending toward blaming the MacBookPro. But&gt;&gt; AlternativesI also have experience with the Brightech - BrightPlay Home HDTM Bluetooth 4.0 Music Receiver / Adapter with apt-X Technology for CD Quality Sound. I set a family member up with one. It has worked well with my MBP, and their iPad and iPhone 6. I would have bought the same one for myself, but since the HomeSpot was a little cheaper and had great reviews I figured I&rsquo;d try it out. Also, I liked the idea of the device not having to be located right at a power point. The BrightPlay sits in the powerpoint (I suppose one could use an extension lead to reposition it), whilst the HomeSpot powers-up via a USB cable. This gives more flexibility as to where it is positioned.&gt;&gt; Conclusion&hellip;I would not buy it again, and would return it if I could (too late for that though). I am now looking for a better device, and also considering WiFi audio streaming instead (such as the Sabrent WiFi Audio Receiver). I see plenty of other people who are very happy with this device (which is why I ordered it), so there&rsquo;s a good chance your experience with it will be better than mine. If you buy it, I&rsquo;d suggest giving it a thorough work-out in the first couple of weeks, on as many different devices and usage scenarios (such as distance from device) as you can. That way, if you&rsquo;re happy with it, great. But if not, you can make use of Amazon&rsquo;s excellent 30 return policy and send it back. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d recommend the Brightech - BrightPlay Home HDTM Bluetooth 4.0 Music Receiver over this HomeSpot device.</p>
