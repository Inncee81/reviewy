Pull out the first and you&rsquo;re grinding meat, breadcrumbs, and more; the second churns out sliced vegetables for potato chips, coleslaw, and the like, or shredded potatoes for hash browns; and the third has you whipping up apple butter in a snap.

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-attachments">Good attachments.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife likes it so far. It&rsquo;s made fairly well, with at least some metal parts. Its a lot more cost effective than buying a Squeezo or other food processor if you already have the Kitchenaid. The pinion gear went out on our mixer (the flour power one) but I think that the gear is made to be a weak point to protect the rest of the machine. I ordered the part and replaced it quite easily. Should be good for another 5-7 or so years&hellip;.She has used the screw and sieve attachment the most for making applesauce and tomato products, but also likes the shredder for cabbage.We&rsquo;ve even lent this set out to two or three of our friends, and they liked it too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kitchen-aid-here-i-come">Kitchen Aid here I come</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so stocked! My kitchen Aid attachments have arrived. I read the &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; and found that I can wash most of the parts in the dishwasher (that&rsquo;s a plus for me). Washed everything and made my very first batch of low-fat, low sodium, no sugar added sausage!Putting the parts together was a snap. And, taking the parts apart for cleaning was a super breeze. Of course, the only downside, if your looking to try out making your own sausages, would be needing a kitchen aid mixer plus attachments. The original start up cost is a bit pricey but so very worth it. I&rsquo;ll be saving up so I can purchase the ice cream maker and pasta makers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shaft-didn-t-fit-into-two-shredding-slicing-blades">Shaft didn&rsquo;t fit into two shredding/slicing blades.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this and was very excited to use it. It comes in a set so the first attachment that I tried to use was the slicer. Unfortunately only two of the slicing/shredding blades would fit onto the shaft because the holes were just a hair too small on two of the blades. I had to get hubby to use the dremel to file these two holes out so they could be big enough to fit the shaft in. Of course it took me about an hour of fiddling around thinking I was doing something wrong before I figured out what the problem was - which was pretty irritating. But once the two holes were opened up, the attachment worked like it was supposed to and I really like the set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-food-grinder-for-meat">Love the Food Grinder for Meat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only used the Food grinder to grind chicken meat so far, it took a little adjusting to get it working correctly. Using this on a Kenmore Elite model. When attaching grind worm into the machine turning the unit on for just a few seconds seats the worm shaft into the unit. This helps when attaching the grinding plate over the knife and seating the plate into the notches so you can attach the tightening ring. I didn&rsquo;t find clean up hard at all, suggest hand washing only and drying the metal parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shredder-was-just-ok-hope-the-food-mill-and-slicer-are-better">Shredder was just OK. Hope the food mill and slicer are better&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My food process, which I often use to shred cheese and cabbage and carrots is on the fritz. I was unsure whether I wanted to replace the entire food processor, so I thought I would just purchase this shredding attachment since I already have a big mixer taking up space in my kitchen.I was optimistic that this would be an improvement over the food processor because I could shred right into the mixing bowl rather than having to clean the food processor&rsquo;s work bowl. Also, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to cut the food into such narrow chunks as required by the narrow feeding tube of the food processor.I recently used it to make cole slaw. I was not terribly impressed. It seemed to pulverize the cabbage more than shred it. I had to use quite a bit of force to get it to process and the end result was mushy rather than crisp.Maybe I should try it on the cheese before I give up completely&hellip;I will indeed be replacing my food processor, which had much nicer results, despite the drawbacks mentioned above.I hope the food mill and slicer attachments are better.</p>

<h5 id="good-set-for-making-your-own-minced-meat-but-plastic-housing-could-have-been-better">Good set for making your own minced meat, but plastic housing could have been better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have this set for one month and have used it 3 or 4 times. Meat grinder works well for pork, chicken and turkey, a bit slower with beef, but still with good results. Also, the mixer gets hot faster when grinding only beef, so I found alternating chunks of beef with softer meats reduces the strain on the motor.Careful with stale bread and other such: the plastic interior of the grinder gets easily scratched inside and I can see it eroding and losing its grinding efficiency over time. However, it’s still great as it helps me cut down the time for making large trays of meatballs or lasagna.Haven’t found much use for the shredder, as it turns out the grinder suffices for shredding cheese and potatoes for my cooking purposes. The slicer is still waiting for an occasion. Overall, can recommend it, bearing in mind the above comments about the plastic. Would have appreciated all-metal gears and housing.</p>

<h5 id="the-grinder-and-strainer-attachments-work-like-a-dream">The grinder and strainer attachments work like a dream</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The grinder and strainer attachments work like a dream, exactly as they should. However, the quality of the blades for the slicer attachment are less than great.Everything fits together like it should, but the quality of the blades is not very good. During manufacture the barrel is formed, the blades are punched out, and then sharpened by grinding. But the grinding was haphazard at best on these and the blades are uneven and dull. Especially on the fine grater, the blades wanted to just cut wide, ribbed ribbons instead of narrow shreds.I filed it all by hand until they were of an acceptable sharpness- and it worked - but now it&rsquo;s prone to rusting where I filed. If I dry them after washing and spritz a little oil on them occasionally they don&rsquo;t rust, but it&rsquo;s more work than I wanted to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-attachment">Nice attachment.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love all things KitchenAid and this is no different. I had two problems, one was one of the shredder disks was not formed correctly and doesn&rsquo;t fit on the shaft properly. It takes a lot of force to get it on and off. I don&rsquo;t want to return it but for the price I paid, I should get something that is made right. The other complaint is the hopper is just too small. I had bought the food tray attachment to go with it but it isn&rsquo;t any good either as it doesn&rsquo;t fit right and it leaks. The attachments work very well and make my straining, pureeing, slicing and shredding very quick and efficient. I do wish there was a bit more room for the bowl and a catch bowl for the discards on the strainer but we can&rsquo;t have it all. LOL! All in all, a good product.</p>
