<h5 id="my-sumo-has-been-a-great-workhorse-why-workhorse">my Sumo has been a great workhorse. Why workhorse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As with many of the reviewers here, my Jumping Sumo stopped jumping soon after I received my Sumo. However, other than the lack of ability to go airborne, my Sumo has been a great workhorse. Why workhorse? Because I used my Sumo Bot for teaching purposes. One of my 4th grade classes spent all year studying drones. Now, technically, Sumo isn&rsquo;t really a drone, since it doesn&rsquo;t go airborne (and even when it was jumping, it&rsquo;s technically not an airborne robot). However, my students decided that the most useful robot around school would be one that could deliver papers from classroom to classroom. So Sumo was used extensively to transport papers on a variety of student-built contraptions. Being able to control Sumo from a tablet was very convenient, as we&rsquo;re an iPad classroom. In addition, some of the contraptions were quite heavy or had a great deal of drag on them, but Sumo still prevailed, so the rolling motor is quite a workhorse and I was very impressed. My students were also able to start programming Sumo using the Tickle app. Overall, other than the non-jumping issue, I was quite happy with Sumo and am considering purchasing a second Sumo for my classroom for next year. I&rsquo;m hoping to be able to get an educational discount or something similar, as I&rsquo;m working on a teacher&rsquo;s salary, and I purchased my first Sumo (and Rolling Spider) for my class using my own funds.</p>

<h5 id="good-first-try-returned-it">Good first try. Returned it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used the Drone for about a week. It was fun but not as &ldquo;cool&rdquo; as I expected but i probably could have realized that by researching the specifications before buying. I eventual returned it because the kicker broke the first week and was catching on the drone body.Likes-Fast-Fun-the concept-replacement parks are available on the manufactures website (like this a lot)Dislike- Small battery and short life- Wi-Fi range degrades quickly especially when not in line of sight- Video is 640 x 480 and requires a micro USB Stick to plug into the drone to record.- Wheels are foam, and not rubber &amp; tread so they don&rsquo;t grip some surfaces and won&rsquo;t let you climb over things.- Jump mechanism is very loudI might buy this again if some of my dislikes are addressed in a future version or the price drops significantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-range-and-battery-life-are-terrible-it-loses-connection-at-around-20-feet-range">The range and battery life are terrible. It loses connection at around 20 feet range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The range and battery life are terrible. It loses connection at around 20 feet range. I have WiFi throughout my house, but this stupid device insists on using its own drone-hosted WiFi network, thus crippling its range.It makes a variety of annoying noises, and even if you don&rsquo;t drive it, its battery will drain after only about an hour off the charger.The camera relays no audio &ndash; probably because the designers know that you can never drive it far enough away to not be able to hear what its microphone would hear.What a waste of money. I should have learned my lesson from 2 years ago, when I bought a Parrot quad copter. After a few weeks, and maybe a dozen flights, the charger and/or the battery stopped working.Parrot makes junk. I should have read the critical reviews, and not pinned my hopes on the presence of a few 5-star reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-toy-for-a-few-hours-but-not-for-major-drone-fans">Great toy for a few hours, but not for major drone fans.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Alright so this great for about 2 hours until your kinda like meh, I don&rsquo;t know about this.Pros-Has a front camera so you can control it with your phone which is awesome-not very hard to control and goes pretty fast-price man, can&rsquo;t beat how cheap a toy like this isCons-the material seems really cheap and flimsy like it would easily be breakable-DOES NOT run as smooth as you see in the commercial videos at all. Nor does it jump as easy. The drone seriously has to be at a stand still or moving slowly for an accurate jump.-Drone disconnects a ton, so be prepared with a full phone battery and lots of patience-Done battery does not last long at all-Cannot see in the dark at all and it does have problems going to another room even if your not to far awaySo long story short, its fun for the price and for just a little toy to play with, but it&rsquo;s not for someone looking for a high quality functioning floor drone.</p>

<h5 id="poor-quality">Poor Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item and it was great. until after 6 jumps. A piece of plastic came out of it and it would not jump.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-camera-is-pretty-cool-stopped-jumping-after-a-week">The camera is pretty cool. Stopped jumping after a week.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Son wanted the jumping drone. Camera is pretty neat. Software downloads to a phone or tablet from Google Play or Apple. Then the phone or tablet runs the drone via wifi. Software does not work with Amazon (Fire tablets). Can&rsquo;t take pictures or video unless you have external memory inserted; can only view what the camera sees real-time. The jumping mechanism broke after a week. Still drives around just fine, just won&rsquo;t jump. Battery has about a 15-minute charge. Son likes it. It beeps and stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-think-there-is-a-very-serious-issue-with-the-jumping-mechanism-of-this-product-and-was-very-disappointed-i-tried-to-leave-ask">I think there is a very serious issue with the jumping mechanism of this product and was very disappointed. I tried to leave ask</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I order this item and the jumping mechanism didn&rsquo;t work. Returned it to Amazon, they sent a replacement. That one jumped for about 30 minutes and failed. Another family member purchased the same thing and the first one the sound didn&rsquo;t work. Got it replaced and the jumping mechanism quit in about an hour. I am an adult over 50 and all four of these jumping sumo&rsquo;s were only played with where I could see them. The person using them was 13. They were never abused. I think there is a very serious issue with the jumping mechanism of this product and was very disappointed. I tried to leave ask Parrot about this and they sent me a standard reply that was only to return it. I would not recomment this item until they get the bugs out of it.</p>
