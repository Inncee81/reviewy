<blockquote>
<p>I am absolutely in love with this little washer. I have used it quite a few times before I decided to write a review, my parents bought this for me as a gift because I was sick of going to the laundry room in my building to wash. I had to go to Home Depot and purchase a longer hose and adapter that will fit my faucet and it works perfectly. If you use commonsense you will not have any issues, A word of advice is less is more. Do not overload because this will cause damage to this machine. It clearly states that this is used for light to medium loads. This is perfect because it is just my son and myself and I try to keep my laundry at a minimum and spread out the number of loads. The water pressure is awesome, it is extremely powerful yet it is very quiet at the same time. The price was amazing and I&rsquo;m super glad that we went with something that has a drain pump therefore avoiding having to lift or move the hose to drain the water. The spin dry is awesome as it gets about 95% of the water out of my clothes. As much as you may want to load more into this little machine keep in mind this is less than half the size of your normal washer. Less is more! Would definitely purchase again!READ MORE</p>

<p> UPDATE#2:Had this little machine for four months now. I still use it everyday. Sometimes use it twice or three times. Stopped using the big washer in the garage all together because this machine does a great job at washing and removing tough stains. Since my last update I learned that machine has an automated overfill protection. Whenever I put too much water in it(which only happens when I am not using the adapter-sometimes when I hand fill the machine ) it won&rsquo;t let the water spill over. Love that smart design. The price was $134, now I see it is $199. That&rsquo;s a bit too much though. I would go with bigger portable washers that are available in that price range and with adapters that fit the US Faucets. Overall, still happy. It&rsquo;s a workhorse.UPDATE#1:Had this machine for three weeks now. Orignal price was $134. It is has been steadily rising since then. It is showing as $169 today. Have been running it daily, sometimes twice a day. The quality of wash is still amazing. With faucet adapter it has turned into a &ldquo;load and forget&rdquo; thing for me. Buy it.If you decide to purchase, buy this adapter as well. It fits the faucet aerator. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LDR-530-2050-Aerator-Adapter/dp/B00BHZLR4K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497650859&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=faucet+hose+adapterAmazing">https://www.amazon.com/LDR-530-2050-Aerator-Adapter/dp/B00BHZLR4K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497650859&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=faucet+hose+adapterAmazing</a> machine, bought through ebay, from the same seller. Comes in a brown box, doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a washer in case you are not supposed to have the washer in your unit. Does fantastic job at washing clothes. I am using the bucket to fill, because the hose that came with it is piece of crap and doesn&rsquo;t fit the us faucets. And we are not plumber savvy and can&rsquo;t figure out what adapters the faucet needs to make this hose work. two buckets of water fills it up, and it washes and spins clothes pretty dry that they dry on the drying rack within an hour or so. Play with the settings and once you figure this thing out, you will love it.You can type in a &ldquo;garden hose faucet adapter&rdquo; here on amazon and purchase that little thing that fits in your faucet aerator. I purchased the adapter and been using it now. If you live in an apartment and have to use the washer in the laundromat or the community washer-definitely buy this machine. I have been running it every single day from day one, and it washes clothes better than our full sized Amana Front Loader HE washer. Our large washer leaves the stubborn stains on the clothes, but this thing due to the soak setting gets all the dirt and stains out. Clothes come out clean. Please watch the video review I made to see how this washer looks and like this review if you think it was helpful.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="found-the-adapter-at-lowes-in-a-plastic-pack">Found the adapter at Lowes in a plastic pack.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give 5 stars yet, we just unpacked it and went to Lowes for the adapter. Depending on your faucet, we needed a female to male adapter because when we unscrewed the tip of ours, we have threads on the outside. After much looking and talking to the man working plumbing section we purchased a Danco Garden Hose adapter to a male faucet. We also upgraded the hose to chrome with ends on. Hooked up, ran water and works great! This is not the one that says FOR PORTABLE WASHERS. It is a garden hose adapter.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-little-machine">Love this little machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this little machine! My first impression when I took it out of the box was, &ldquo;how cute!&rdquo; It is small, but is exactly what I needed. Have done dozens of loads in the past month catching up on all the laundry I had been hand washing. Ideal for trailer living. It does a phenomenal job of cleaning and spin drying. Much quieter than I would have expected. I did have to purchase an adapter for the kitchen faucet and a longer hose, but that is to be expected any time you have a portable appliance of this type, so why people complain about that, is beyond me. I found it helpful to elevate this little machine by using 4 cinder blocks, which was cheap and easy. Because it&rsquo;s small, you have to be careful not to overload with too much or it will throw it off balance. A little common sense goes a long way. The price is better than any comparable machine and it shipped from California to New Hampshire in a weeks time. The controls are intuitive and have worked without issue. I like the pause feature so I can readjust the load if needed. It has a low, medium, or high water level settings and so far have only used the high setting. The rinse cycle rinses twice automatically. When I want only one additional rinse, I set for wash only, then when that&rsquo;s finished, (it beeps when done) I set it on spin. There is a little lint trap in the washer that works fine. I have 2 Alaskan Malamutes so dog hair is a problem for me and the lint trap does as good a job as it can for what it is. This has been a very satisfactory purchase and I would purchase it again. If you have a space constraint, hate the laundromat and that expense, this little machine is worth it. For the price, it appears to be constructed well. Considering I&rsquo;ve really been giving this little machine a heck of a workout, it&rsquo;s performed admirably!READ MORE</p>
