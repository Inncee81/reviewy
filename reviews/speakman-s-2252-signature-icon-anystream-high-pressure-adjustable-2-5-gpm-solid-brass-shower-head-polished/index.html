<h5 id="let-thy-flesh-be-cleansed">Let thy flesh be cleansed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to admit. I have a problem. I&rsquo;m addicted to water pressure. Just can&rsquo;t live without it. And if high pressure showers are wrong, I don&rsquo;t wanna be right!My version of a successful shower is the peace of mind of knowing that when I step out, one full layer of epidermis has been thoroughly expunged. I live for the feeling of pure, unadulterated water power pressure washing everything away.So imagine my disappointment when my first ever house purchase, though full of water pressure potential, left something to be desired. The cleansing ability lay dormant, with no device present to harness this latent power. Undeterred, I searched until the instrument of my shower salvation was discovered.The Speakman S-2252 Anystream is one of those dying breeds that lives by the ages old yet dying creed, &ldquo;Do one thing, and do it well.&rdquo; This shower head delivers power. Raw, unapologetic power. But that is something to be described a little later.The first thing you notice about this shower head is that, despite it&rsquo;s rather diminutive size, it is hefty. There is no mistaking whether this item is made of quality materials. Gravity and mass make sure of that. Solid brass, made to last.The second trait is simplicity. There is no rotary dial with 100 settings. There is simply a lever on the side that moves the 8 nozzles on the face of the head in and out. When moved in the nozzles &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; the water, like your finger covering the end of a hose, giving you defined jets of water and higher pressure. When moved out the nozzles allow free flow of water. Less pressure, but much higher flow. The beauty is that even with such simplicity, the lever can be stopped anywhere you like to adjust streams and pressure to your liking. You really do have the option of &ldquo;Anystream&rdquo;.Instructions for installation were included and were simple and clear. Like most shower heads, installation isn&rsquo;t rocket science, but if you&rsquo;ve never done it before, the instructions make it pretty difficult to mess up. Also included was a small roll of Teflon tape. I was quite pleased with this, as I had misplaced my own roll. I also was pleasantly surprised to find that there is probably enough tape included for 3 installs, so the rest was thrown into the toolbox to be put to future use.Then, to the moment of truth. I turned on the shower and no leakage. But the pressure. Oh! The pressure! I hadn&rsquo;t even stepped into the shower, yet I knew I had found what I had been looking for. I could feel the rush of air as it moved out of the way of the water. I smiled. This was the moment I had been waiting for. I stepped in&hellip;I can only describe the shower experience with one word&hellip; Joy. My wife will testify to the fact that I was giggling like a schoolgirl the entire time. Like Michael Jordan clutching his first NBA championship trophy, I embraced the water as a long lost friend. This was what I had searched so long for. The perfect shower experience. When the nozzles of the head are turned out for full flow, it&rsquo;s like having someone continually pour buckets of water on your head. Need to rinse off some soap? Done. In an instant. There is no waiting here. But, when you really want to step to the next level, turn that lever all the way over and you will be met with something only a step below a fire hose. On its highest setting, the jets that flew from this shower head stung me. That&rsquo;s not an exaggeration. They literally stung. Some might not find that appealing. I, however, could do nothing but grin like the kid who just received his first bike.Am I satisfied with my purchase? Oh yes. This shower head is not for the faint of heart. But if you have the courage to enter the heart of darkness, you WILL emerge victorious. You will emerge refreshed. You may even be a new person. But one thing is sure. Your flesh will be cleansed.(One thing to note. As most shower heads do, this one came with a flow regulator pre-installed. It is a simple plastic piece fitted into the connector end of the head. If you are like me and don&rsquo;t enjoy feeling restricted in your shower taking, you will want to remove this piece. Of all the things that I tried, I would recommend a pick or pointed Phillips screwdriver and a hammer. After fiddling with it for a few minutes trying other methods, one good whack with the screwdriver on the inner edge of the plastic had it dislodged immediately. I am more than happy that I removed this piece. However, considering just how absurdly good this shower head is, I would suggest trying it with the regulator in place first. I would have to think that it will be more than capable even with governmental shackles on it. When I purchase another one of these for the guest bathroom I will most likely leave the regulator in at first to compare. I will try to remember to update this review at that time when I do.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smooth, fluid motion via the handle gives a fair variation in streams.Pressure seems great, you may not even need to remove the flow restrictor though I am adding a photo showing what it looks likeInside the back of the head you will see a black O ring. That is the restrictor. You can remove just this and then have the option of re-installing it later or completely remove all the white plastic inside for maximum flow but no option to restrict it again later</p>

<h5 id="simply-the-best-regardless-of-price">Simply The Best - Regardless Of Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like many of the folks who have reviewed the Speakman Anystream shower-head, a great shower requires a drenching flow of water. I bought this shower-head to replace a 22 year old Speakman Anystream that was installed in our outdoor shower. The old one had corroded to the point where I couldn&rsquo;t precisely control the water flow, the salt air and outdoor environment finely won out.With that as background the new shower-head doesn&rsquo;t give the same flow, I haven&rsquo;t yet remove the restrictor, but it still work&rsquo;s very well. I also happy to see he quality hasn&rsquo;t been compromised, the new one is just a s heavy as the 22 year old one. I know it&rsquo;s 22 because that when we installed the outdoor shower.As for the skeptics, I spend much of my life traveling, all over the globe, staying a wide range of hotels and years ago I noticed that whenever I was in a new hotel and loved the shower, it was always a Speakman shower-head. The result is that every shower we have uses a Speakman, with no regrets.</p>

<h5 id="good-solid-shower-head">Good Solid Shower Head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this shower head. I have had it installed for over a year without any issues. I did follow the recommendation of other reviewers and removed the water reducing gasket so I get higher water pressure coming out of the shower head. It is solid and heavy not like some other cheap plastic shower heads I have purchased in the past. If I am looking to replace another shower head with this style then I will probably look for this model or a similar model from Speakman.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-shower-head">Nice shower head.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I removed the o-ring before initially installing this.It gave a nice wide fine but hard spray to a fairly narrow heavy spray.I then tried it with the white flow reducer removed and it feels about the same to me.I do have good water pressure so maybe that&rsquo;s why it didn&rsquo;t seem to make much of a difference.Overall, I like the fine, hard spray.It rinses soap and shampoo off really easily and feels great.I&rsquo;d definitely buy it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="look-no-further">Look no further.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the shower head you are looking for! It&rsquo;s actually made of metal and took an old shower spigot that felt like a fine mist and turned our shower into a firehose! (that might be an exaggeration, but it&rsquo;s wonderful). My husband and I dispute over the size of the preferred stream, but it&rsquo;s easy to adjust with the handle on the side, so we can easily both be happy.We didn&rsquo;t have to take out the ring either to get the better pressure. I&rsquo;m in a 3 story townhouse with the water heater in the basement. This was exactly the shower head we needed.The brushed nickle is a nice color too that doesn&rsquo;t require constant cleaning/polishing.</p>

<h5 id="great-metal-well-built-piece">Great metal well built piece.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was looking for a shower head that isnt cheap plastic for a long time. Finally saw one similar to this at a high end hotel and was sold on it. It is a nice full metal piece. You can chose from a range of a harder spray option to more of a waterfall option. My favorite is right in the middle. And boy does this thing put out some good pressure and water amount.I highly suggest ALL Speakman products and I don&rsquo;t believe I will buy anything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny">Worth every penny</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very high quality piece, just what I expected knowing the Speakman name and the reviews it has always gotten. Had a knock-off which got clogged and corroded in a couple of years, decided to go for quality. the item was exactly as described, even came with a little bit of Teflon tape for wrapping the pipe threads, nicely finished metal and good adjustable spray control. Excellent item.</p>
