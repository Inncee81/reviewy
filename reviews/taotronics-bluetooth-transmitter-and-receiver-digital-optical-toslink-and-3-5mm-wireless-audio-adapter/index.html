<h5 id="very-satisfied-with-the-replacement">Very satisfied with the replacement.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to connect to my TV so I could listen through BT earphones and, when it arrived, I charged the unit and connected it using the supplied digital optical cable, set the switches to TX and SPDIF and paired it with my earbuds. Pairing was more difficult than I thought it would be but eventually my earbuds paired and I began to hear the sound from the TV. I sat about 10 feet from the transmitter so I knew I was within the specified distance for this device to work.Everything was fine for about 2 or 3 minutes and then the sound began to skip. That is, there were silent spaces in the TV sound with part of the dialog missing. After about 5or 6 minutes the sound completely broke up and I could not make sense of any of the sound from the TV. This sequence repeated itself - normal sound, missing pieces of the sound, completely broken up sound - while I listened and I eventually gave up.I also tried using the aux audio output thinking that perhaps the issue was the digital audio output from my TV but that connection was even worse.I had been using the earbuds for some time without any issue but, just to be sure, I connected them to the BT on my computer and played an internet movie without issue. I then connected it to my smartphone and again, without issue. listened to audio. I was really disappointed in this unit and wanted a replacement, making the assumption that perhaps it was the unit I received, but Amazon did not offer to send me a replacement and I was forced to choose between a refund or a gift card. I now must try to find some other unit that will work better than this one.UPDATE:As I mentioned in my review I had made the assumption that my problems, described above, were related to the specific unit I received rather than the product as a whole. I assumed this because the product had generally received very good reviews and my unit did not work well at all. Sunvalleytek customer service contacted me and offered to send a replacement unit and, when it arrived, the first thing I did was charge it and, after it had charged, connect it to my TV. As with the previous unit I used the optical connection and set the unit to transmit.I was able to pair my bluetooth headset to the unit, turned the TV mute control on and then sat down to watch. Unlike my previous experience this time the unit worked properly. I watched TV for about 20 minutes and the sound was rock solid, no skips, no misses, no breakup. I then set the cable box (I use Tivo) to play some of the recordings and they worked properly. I then connected to Netflix and watched some streaming video and it worked without an issue. As a last test I turned the DVD player on, inserted a disk and watched a bit of it and, as with the other tests this worked properly. I had no problems.One of the things I wanted to test was the time lag between words being spoken and the sound being received. I had already tried a unit from a different manufacturer and found that I had gotten about a quarter second delay between the visual indication of a sound and the recipe of the sound in my earbuds and I wanted to see if this unit was any different. While there may have been some delay it had to be very small because I generally could not see any difference between people&rsquo;s lips moving and the words being played in my earbuds. This unit must have faster hardware for whatever delay there might have been to not be noticeable.I then tried this with a second pair of bluetooth earbuds and found it to also work properly. One thing I liked about this unit is that, while it is small, it is not so small as to be unstable. The other unit I had received was so small and light that a slight movement of the cable meant that the unit itself might be knocked to the floor. This unit, while small and light, is more substantial than the competitor and I appreciated that. It also has a small rubber circle on the bottom which makes it less likely to be moved accidentally and prevents it from scratching the surface it sits on.The last thing I want to mention was the speed and helpfulness of Sunvalleytek&rsquo;s customer service people. They contacted me right away, they sent out a replacement the same day using 2 day delivery and it was delivered on a Sunday. I consider that to be extraordinarily good customer service and I wanted to mention how helpful they were.In general I was very pleased with the replacement and have changed my review rating accordingly. I understand that sometimes a bad unit can get through the manufacturing process, even with the best quality control, and this seemed to be such a case.</p>

<h5 id="from-one-star-to-five">From One Star to Five</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I want to watch tv at night when everyone else in the family has gone to sleep, I prefer to use bluetooth headphones.I have tried a few different bluetooth transmitters in the past but they have been hard to connect and seem to randomly drop the signal. I even had to shut the bluetooth off on my phone or the headphones would grab the phone instead of transmitter.This TaoTronics instantly connected and reconnected every time I turned the headphones on to watch cable tv. I was even able to leave my phones bluetooth on. My joy was quickly dashed when I tried the Amazon and Netflix app on my LG Smart tv. Neither app would send sound to my headphones. I contacted both TaoTronics and LG to help solve this problem. Although both customer service reps were friendly and tried to help, neither one could make this transmitter play sound for Apps . I decided to try some more settings on my tv and I accidentally found the answer to get sound from any source on my TV. In the Sound out settings, Digital Sound Out set at Auto equals no sound on Apps, set at PCM sound is crystal clear on everything. One other suggestion, plug your transmitter into a constant power source, not the tv so whenever you turn on your headphones it instantly connects. I have had everything set up for over two weeks and I haven&rsquo;t had to touch the transmitter since the first night. Other transmitters I have had I had to hit the on/connect button nightly.</p>

<h5 id="bluetooth-4-1-transmitter-and-receiver-review">Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter and Receiver review!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter and Receiver a week or so back. This makes your tv except Bluetooth devices. I thought this was great so I could hand my wife a headset when I&rsquo;m working on my PC.To use this device you must connect it through one of the 3 ports. You have an optical port , aux port or RCA ports. I used the optical port. You will also need to charge the device or leave it plugged in. Now I tried to leave it plugged into the TV USB port but every time you shut the Tv of you have to pair the device again. So I suggest you find a wall USB plug. You do have the option to just charge the device then unplug it also since it has an internal battery. This battery will last 15 hours of play time. You can also connect two Bluetooth headsets at once.To power on the device hold it for 3 second and it will light up. Once that is done you then tap the power button twice and it is in pair mode. You then hit pair mode on your headset and listen for it to connect.The device works well and easy. You can mute your tv and still hear your headset. Which can be good if you have your office PC in the same room. It could also come in handy for those who want to watch TV in bed and not bug the significant other. You will need a headset that can adjust its own volume. I added adhesive to the back and stuck it to the back of my tv.The company is good to work with and answers emails fast if you have any issue. The package showed up on time and works well.I would recommend this device to anyone who works from home.All opinion on all opinions are mine and mine alone.</p>
