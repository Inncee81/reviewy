<h5 id="great-purchase-definitely-worth-a-look">Great purchase! Definitely worth a look!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this TV today after spending about 1.5 hours at the store testing it out. I will tell you that its best to see the results for yourself rather than reading a review (especially the bad ones. I&rsquo;l explain why) To start, its best for you to bring your own videos to actually see real stuff. I recommend downloading the &ldquo;Lights Out&rdquo; trailer in HD or the &ldquo;Scream 4 Credits&rdquo; in HD from Youtube. (more about this later) Take these to the store and tell the rep you want to play these videos.To start, the color on this TV are absolutely amazing. The skin tones are practically lifelke, The TV absolutely rocks for its price. I enjoyed playing with Google TV. its fast and stable. However, I did notice some lag (about 1-2 seconds) after launching one of the apps.Now, the reason why I said you should download those videos has to do with what the bad reviewers say about the TV&rsquo;s light bleed. I decided to see it for myself and download real content to look at VS watching a TV demo so I bought my USB drive and had the rep plug it in so i could get a REAL test. By the way, if you do this, it will take about 2 minutes for the TV to read whats on your USB drive. Thats annoying. If you play the &ldquo;Lights Out&rdquo; trailer, there is a scene at the beginning, where she repeatedly turns off the light and back on. During this time, you get to see how the TV handles dark scenes. You will see how the TV doesnt have the blackest blacks ever for a TV and you do see just a tad light bleeed and it is tad bit blackish/greyish when the light goes out. This is further confirmed by playing the &ldquo;Scream 4&rdquo; credits video.You will see that there is a little light bleed but it is nothing to be of concern of. It could be blacker yes, but the TV makes up for this due its high color display. You will notice that you can see what is in the dark because the display is able to lighten up certai parts of the scene. This is confirmed when playing the Scream 4 credits video. The TV shines during the &ldquo;Scream 4&rdquo; credits because it is able to immediately rearrange the colors on skin tones in dark scenes so they dont appear washed out due to light bleeding! I&rdquo;m assuming It is due to the Triluminos and Xreality Pro tech built into the TV.What really drove me to purchase the TV though was the upscaler. Yes, playing those videos (Lights Out 1080p, Scream 4 720p) will cause the TV to defintely go into Upscale mode and you will notice how clear the picture is. The clarity of those videos was so clear, that the rep actually thougth it was full 4K. That should speak for itself how amazing the upscaler is. If you have HD cable, you wont be disappointed as this will make all your HD channels practically 4k for you. Just seeing this in action will make anyone purchase the TV (or it should at least). That is what the people who gave the TV bad reviews fail to mention.I had the rep play these videos on the Xbr65x930D (Sonys flaghship this year) and the xbr65x900 (Sonys flaghsip last year) for a comparison so I could see with my own eyes. I recommend you do this too. Get this model and avoid the xbrx900 or play the videos on them to see with your own eyes. The light bleed will definitely be noticeable in each corner on the x900. Its so bad on the x900 that im suprised Sony never issued a recall on that model. It seriously looks like a major defect. The x930 will defintely knock both of these TVs out in picture quality out due to it having local dimming as well as the the fact that its not using an IPS display that the 65x850D uses. However on regular scenes like the common cable TV sitcom or watching a movie like Avengers, or the news or Netflix or Hulu., you wil not be able to tell the difference from this model vs the x930 in terms of color. It does lack in dark scenes, but it makes up for it in everything elseOther cool things, its an android TV, has Playstation Now and supports screen mirrroring, out of the box. You can install many apps on it. I dont know if this will slow down the TV but i dont use that many apps anyway. I didnt like that when I put in my USB flash drive it took like 2 minutes for it to read the contents. It detected the USB immediately but then when it was reading it took two minutes to show that I had content on it. -_- .Overall, this tV is a great buy! Download those videos from Youtube using whatever program of your choosing but just make sure it can download them in HD. Or, download your own videos of your choosing that have dark scenes in them.. Take it to best buy or whatever store you go to and have the rep play the videos. They are usually more than happy to do so. Its best to see with your own eyes. Play them on al three of the TVs to see a comparison an difference in picture clarity, black levels, and how the TVs upscale.</p>

<h5 id="75-screen-review">75&rdquo; Screen Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a review for the 75&rdquo; Version.If you are shopping for a 75&rdquo; TV, this is a solid value. The options are fairly limited at this size.Here are the current 75&rdquo; TVs available, and my key research points added to assist other buyers.1. Sony X850D ~$3300 (IPS Panel, 420-422 cd/m2 brightness)2. LG UH8500 ~$3500 (IPS Panel, 219-556 cd/m2 brightness)3. Vizio P-Series ~$3800 (VA Panel, 317-535 cd/m2 brightness)4. Samsung JU7100 ~$3300 (VA Panel, 323-324 cd/m2 brightness)&ndash;5. Samsung KS9000 ~$6000 (VA Panel, 515-1489 cd/m2 brightness)6. Sony X940D ~$6000 (VA Panel, 465-1054 cd/m2 brightness)How did I narrow this down?1. In my situation, the features on the x940d and KS9000 do not warrant an additional $2200 - $2700 in price for the 75&rdquo; models.2. For a large living room space with avg. viewing distance at 10&rsquo;, wide viewing angles and brightness were my key considerations. Since the JU7100 and P-Series are both VA panels, I decided to eliminate those from contention.3. This left the X850D and UH8500 IPS panels. I ultimately decided on the X850D due to the sustained brightness and slightly lesser price point.Pros:1. Value2. Quality bezel / frame3. Remote Control, including voice &amp; microphone integration for SmartTV features such as a Youtube search.4. Remembers multitude of custom picture settings for each input source5. Default picture modes6. Built-in speakers above average7. Color8. SmartTV OS, specifically Netflix integration &amp; 4k quality. We upgraded our Netflix account to stream 4k content, and it looks amazing on this TV. There are quite a few scenic type 4k shows on Netflix to try out. There is a Netflix button on the Sony remote, and the integration is excellent - just hit the Netflix button and you go directly to the app, pick out your show, then you&rsquo;re on your way. The TV automatically renders 4k or upscales non-4k for whatever you are watching. We use a hard-wired connection to our LAN from the TV, and Netflix streams 4k content without any issue.9. Youtube from the SmartTV/Android TV OS is outstanding. You can use the integrated microphone on the remote to search, then once you make your selection the TV displays the content full screen and does a great job rendering/upscaling the content. We often watch upcoming movie trailers now through Youtube on our living room TV and it feels like we&rsquo;re in a mini-theater.Cons:1. Could be brighter to fight off ambient daytime light. Daytime lighting performance &amp; contrast levels.2. Would like for a quicker way to switch through picture modes (I often flip from vivid to cinema between day and evening viewing)3. Ambient daylight reflections and glare could possibly be improved with a different screen material.One other note, it was very difficult for me to gauge the screens on display at stores. They all truly looked outstanding. Even with all 6 of the screens listed above at 75&rdquo; on display in dimly lit theater styled rooms I could not pick between any of them except the X940D and KS9000 which appeared more vivid. However, that was not worth the large increase in price at the 75&rdquo; model. FWIW to Sony or Samsung I would have probably sprung for the X940D or KS9000 in the $4500 range.For viewing in a family room, with wide angles and all lighting conditions depending on time of day, I will most likely be replacing this screen once more affordable 75&rdquo; options are available in the coming years that can better deal with fighting through ambient daylight and improving contrast &amp; black levels.I will update this review if anyone has any specific questions with the X850D.11/23/16 Review Update: Coming up on 4 months of ownership on the new TV - everything is working great. Regarding the picture, I&rsquo;ve really come to appreciate the cinema and home cinema modes. They create a very realistic picture, especially color - and is a good starting point for creating custom picture modes. For movies, this TV is in it&rsquo;s wheel-house at night with dim, warm lighting. The &ldquo;Advanced Contrast Enhancer&rdquo; setting is also great - recommend setting that to high as it improves low light scenes.1/14/17 Review Update: Couple more pros and cons, and everything is still functioning great.Pro: If you are a UFC fan, streaming a Live UFC match in 4k looks incredible via the Android TV UFC app (Currently, only available on a Sony).Con: Dark Scene Contrast. This is not the TV&rsquo;s fault and is just more a limitation of all LCD and IPS screens (obsolete by OLED and improved by local dimming LCDs). In dark scenes w/ some type of ambient light (moon-light, candle light etc..) the tv cannot properly shade individual dark elements on the screen, giving everything a dark gray sheen. The &ldquo;Advanced Contrast Enhancer&rdquo; does help and recommend setting this to high.</p>

<h5 id="impressive-sony-tv">Impressive Sony TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke my heart when my plasma died about a month ago. Loved it for smooth motion and great colors. Looked around at various LED tv&rsquo;s for a replacement and compared various models under $2k and narrowed my choices to LG, Samsung, Sony. This model is from 2016, just hit the floors after debuting at CES and I could not be happier. As close as possible to my plasma smoothness and the picture is outstanding. Movies look good as well. I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s hard for a tv to look great showing live sports AND movies. I don&rsquo;t know about that, I just know I made a good choice for the next several years for our family. Voice control on some of the apps via Android TV is fun. 4k stuff is expanding and the few things we have watched are spectacular. This tv is also capable of updating itself and is HDR ready for whatever comes down the road the next few years. Still exploring the options, but my first month report card for this tv is a solid &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p>
