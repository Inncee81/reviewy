<h5 id="know-what-you-re-getting-manage-your-expectations">Know what you&rsquo;re getting. Manage your expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered mine at the prerelease price. I have live streamed four contemporary church services on Facebook using public wifi and my iPhone 5s. I have it 5ft from the (elevated) stage on a mic stand. I use an external battery designed for a GoPro since I record 2-2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hrs continuously. I use the built in mic with fairly good results. Auto color balance and exposure are good inspite of frequent harsh lighting. I am generally pleased. I am very pleased with the responsiveness of the manufacturer. They have already released 2 updates. They also respond on the customer Facebook page.Please consider your intended use and MEVO&rsquo;s limitations. Then lower your expectations a few notches. It does much better in good light—grainy otherwise. It&rsquo;s mic can&rsquo;t work miracles—external micing is possible at an added expense. Internet speed (upload&gt;6) is needed for highest quality streaming. It can stream in 2 lower qualities. It is designed to be a one camera solution to streaming a multi cam event. In August 2016, it is in it&rsquo;s first iteration with evolving software. It hasn&rsquo;t met my all of expectations; but, I really like it and look forward to seeing it mature.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-as-expected-very-pleased-with-the-results">Worked as expected - very pleased with the results</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked exactly as advertised and does what we want. Good quality video, no problems streaming to Facebook, controlling it from a phone was a breeze. The only minor grumble was with the sound quality which wasn&rsquo;t quite as good as we expected, but it was certainly fit for purpose. We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing how it goes. It is very unobtrusive on-stage or near the stage during live events - we used a black lighting stand to put it on (taller less imposing and less costly than a tripod).It would need improved sound quality from the built in mics for 5 stars.I would love to see Android support - please, please, please!</p>

<h5 id="what-a-great-device-i-ve-used-it-for-a-few-events">What a great device. I&rsquo;ve used it for a few events &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great device. I&rsquo;ve used it for a few events at my school and for a work event. Very easy to setup and use. Picture quality is fantastic. Makes live streaming an event so simple. Highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="also-the-documentation-is-poor-and-the-connection-set-up-is-poor">Also the documentation is poor and the connection set up is poor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had it for a week and I find it limited because I have to have a 3mbps upload speed or the quality is dropped to 480 or 360 dpi. Also the documentation is poor and the connection set up is poor. Trying to change FB live accounts is difficult. I have been trying for 3 days with no success. It only streams with Facebook live and the livestream service. LiveStream is real expensive cheapest is $42 a month and you can pay up to $2000 a month. The battery life is very poor(45 minutes is the best I have gotten so far) so you will need to have it plugged in for recitals, plays, or concerts. You need to be 5-10 feet away from your subject to get the best results. A tight zoom gets a little grainy and pixelated. But it is much cheaper than 3 cameras and a switcher!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-nearly-800-dollars-you-do-not-get-a-return-in-your-investment">For nearly 800 dollars you do NOT get a return in your investment :(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unreliable. I also bought the extended battery. When I purchased it, it was $300. The Mevo itself is $400 so nearly 8 hundred dollars including taxes and let me just say it would be worth it if it were half reliable. IF you&rsquo;re recording something for longer than say 45 minute the Mevo gets extremely hot. I invested almost 100 dollars for a 128 gig memory card that they specifically said is good to use with it and after it gets hot once it&rsquo;s not recognizable. I&rsquo;m really disappointed in this purchase.What is most disappointing is I do a professional facebook live show and youtube videos. It, if worked as if advertized would have been amazing for my show. But I have to now go back to using the ipad because the mevo when getting hot will just cut the video out of nowhere. The stream would end. I would have to reset the camera and hope all my previous viewers are willing to come back&hellip;I even had the Ethernet wire setup with the mevo Boost and purchased separate internet for this exclusively and still have constant problems. If it were a way to get my money back I would because it&rsquo;s so frustrating.I did hold on until they FINALLY released an update. But it still didn&rsquo;t address the many problems it had. When it works it&rsquo;s fine but it still doesn&rsquo;t recognize my SD card after it has fried 2 expensive cards so if the video quality doesn&rsquo;t hold up when streamed to facebook I have no video to edit and it&rsquo;s a shame. I DO FEEL LET DOWN EVERYTIME IT MALFUNCTIONS. And it&rsquo;s sad because I believed in it.</p>

<h5 id="cool-idea-poor-execution">Cool idea, poor execution.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the video quality on this thing is terrible. I used it indoors, I would say our lighting is decent. My iPhone 7+ doesn&rsquo;t have issues with the same lighting, but on this the quality is very poor. All recordings were done on to the micro sd card included. I haven&rsquo;t tried streaming and probably won&rsquo;t. I will just return it. I don&rsquo;t find the litt boxes on the app to work that well either. It automatically creates a couple and then the others are simply impossible to figure out how to setup.</p>

<h5 id="simply-amazing">Simply amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The technology in this camera is absolutely amazing quality is amazing and super simple to use I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to live stream !</p>

<p>I am minister at different churches and with Donations to my ministry I was able to order this Mevo camera to stream live services .</p>

<h5 id="update-this-device-is-useless-with-android-flaky-on-ios-not-ready-for-primetime">UPDATE: This device is useless with Android. Flaky on iOS. Not ready for primetime.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE 10-7-17: Upped it from 3 stars to 4 stars. I&rsquo;m now able to live stream flawlessly to YouTube for 4-hour stretches over wifi (something it was choking on before).</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t make it reliably connect to Internet or Galaxy Edge 7mobile hotspot. Returning for refund. For $399, I found it to be not very user friendly</p>
