<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="be-very-careful">Be very careful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Please be extremely careful when putting the raspberry pi 3 in this case. There is an internal lip that supports the pie inside this case and it comes dangerously close to the raspberry pi&rsquo;s internal Wi-Fi antenna. I can&rsquo;t say for sure if I was not careful enough, or if this case is a bad design. It&rsquo;s that close. I just don&rsquo;t know after the fact. After placing a perfectly functioning raspberry pi 3 inside this case and pressing it closed, I lost all Wi-Fi capability. Upon further inspection I noticed that this lip was pressing very hard against the pies internal Wi-Fi antenna. Please be very careful when closing this case on your pie. It cost me the raspberry pi 3&rsquo;s Wi-Fi capability. I&rsquo;m not very happy with this product. I have included a picture of the raspberry Pi 3&rsquo;s Wi-Fi antenna area that you need to watch out for with this case.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-retro-gaming-kodi-streaming-platform">Perfect Retro Gaming / Kodi Streaming Platform.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this to make a retro game system. After seeing the new Mini NES and how fast it sold out and how limited it was, I figured Pi was the way to go. 32gig microsd card, PS3 controller and about 30 minutes later, I have a fully functional retro game system that can run every game I ever played growing up and all the games I could never afford to play. It is a very versatile device. It runs everything from old C64 games all the way up to PSX without any issues.It also runs Kodi flawlessly. So in addition to having all my favorite old school games, I can watch streaming movies and tv with Kodi and even control it with my cell phone.I purchased this one with the case just because I wasn&rsquo;t sure that the 3D printed case I made was going to fit. 3D case fit like a glove, so if you have access to a 3D printer, there are hundreds of different case designs out on the internet that you can put together and save yourself about 10 bucks and add some style to this little device.To sum it up, for the cost of this, plus an sd card of whatever size you want, you get every game system from 1970 to around 1998 and Kodi which can stream Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and anything else you can find an app to stream. I&rsquo;d say in total, this sub $100.00 purchase is worth every bit of over $1000.00 worth of entertainment equipment.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-starter-kit">Great Starter Kit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great starter kit! Easier to assemble than what some reviewers suggest. Just RTFM! I purchased mine more to get familiar with the tech, and the amount of possibilities does not dissapoint.I installed the native OS and it worked great as a regular computer and internet browser for folks who just want just that (like my Dad). I also installed Windows IOT, which is not exactly an OS, but nevertheless promising for Microsoft users. I installed Centos 7 (Linux) and made a USB wireless hub for a legacy scanner. I finally settled on LibreElec OS for Kodi Media player. Works great.I used the Sandisk Ultra 16GB. Will purchase another kit to create a multi-purpose linux server for my personal comupter lab.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-package">Great little package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I spent a little time trying to figure out how much things would cost if I bought everything separately. Short version&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t worth it, easy enough just to get all of this in one package vs shopping around for a different case/power supply, heat sink etc. It worked out more expensive to do items separately (although I admittedly didn&rsquo;t shop around a ton, I&rsquo;m sure you could do a for a few dollars cheaper, but why). The case is cheap, but it does the job, and who really needs a fancy case for a Pi It wasn&rsquo;t exactly intuitive to put the pi in the case, but easy enough. You don&rsquo;t need to force it. I would definitely buy this again, and recommend to others as a first pi kit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-be-perfect-if-the-middle-plastic-was-an-optional-piece">Would be perfect if the middle plastic was an optional piece</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Give the kit <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> because it gives the essentials for PI3 hardware. The case is really well built and they have cut outs for the PI3 heat sinks. However the case is designed to seal the PI3 in a lower chamber. Unlike the official PI cases (white/pink or black/grey), I would get the high-temp icon with this case. Taking the lid off helped but the case and especially the heat sinks are hot to the touch. Would be perfect if the middle plastic was an optional piece.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="difficult-case-but-otherwise-ok">Difficult case but otherwise ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving this one a 4 because it was extremely complicated to put together without breaking anything and the instructions have no simple 1, 2, 3 steps with pictures. The other technical complaint I have is the new &ldquo;friction fit&rdquo; micro SD card connector. It makes it much more difficult to remove the micro SD card especially when assembled inside the case. So for newbies, don&rsquo;t even bother trying to install this thing in it&rsquo;s case if you want to have the option to replace the micro SD cardI give it 4 stars as it delivered fast with a working product at a good price as expected, but the more complicated plastic case and the new &ldquo;friction fit&rdquo; micro SD slot lost it a star..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-kit-premium-housing-doesnt-work-with-hats">Good kit. Premium Housing, Doesnt work with Hats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything is excellent with this kit.Case fits well, just practice a few times without the board. You dont want to chip a SMD part. Place the board on the bottom piece. Make sure you slide the board into the indents, micro sd side first.The downside of the kit is that while the case has cutouts for ribbon cables, there are some support plastics on the side so you wont be able to stick in a sense hat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-to-have-a-kit-that-includes-heat-sinks">Great to have a kit that includes heat sinks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great to have a kit that includes heat sinks, a sturdy - and easy to assemble and disassemble - case, and a properly rated power supply all in one go. The only reason I&rsquo;m not giving 5 stars is that the design of the case appears to be purpose made for the camera module (including a nice mounting bracket inside the lid to the case, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a practical way to utilize this feature. The ribbon cable gets in the way of itself if you try to mount the camera module where the case suggests.</p>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">works like a charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>fantastic, the rasp. pi 3b+ is so much fun, especially to learn linux via kali</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="runs-pi-hole-easily">Runs pi-hole easily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this to run pi-hole, had pi-hole installed and up and running within 20mins, and it runs it with plenty of power in reserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kit-for-getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-if-you">Great kit for getting started with Raspberry Pi if you &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great kit for getting started with Raspberry Pi if you already have a MicroSD card. The Pi keeps a decent temperature inside of the case&ndash; I&rsquo;ve had it running <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for a few weeks&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-for-the-newbie">Excellent for the newbie.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun little kit. Just don&rsquo;t forget an HDMI cable. I thought I had one&hellip;but didn&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-those-just-getting-started-with-the-pi-3">For those just getting started with the Pi 3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent starters kit for first time users. Heat sinks were a nice addition in this kit, not all Pi kits on the market include them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-purchase-never-any-issues">Great purchase, never any issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never been let down after purchasing a Raspberry Pi CanaKit. This is probably kit number 7 now. Thank you for such a quality product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="case-review-you-probably-already-know-what-you-need-to-about-the-other-accessories">Case review [you probably already know what you need to about the other accessories]</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great case, it even stays shut with a ribbon cable attached to the GPIO pins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth more than Five stars !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="package-was-visibly-damaged-among-the-rest-of-the-kit-which-looked-perfectly-fine-plugged-in">Package was visibly damaged among the rest of the kit which looked perfectly fine. Plugged in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DOA. Package was visibly damaged among the rest of the kit which looked perfectly fine. Plugged in, but nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-set-up-and-get-running">Very easy to set up and get running</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding kit. Very easy to set up and get running. I was able to get the whole thing assembled and running in less than 10 minutes. Would highly recommend to anyone.</p>
