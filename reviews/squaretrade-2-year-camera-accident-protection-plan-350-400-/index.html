<h5 id="refund-with-no-hassle">Refund with no hassle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this on a Lightdow LD6000 that I had for about one year. I let a friend borrow the camera, and when I got it back and tried to charge it, the metal around the USB port fell into the camera, rendering it impossible to charge.This was actually the second Lightdow LD6000, as I had previously damaged the lens on my first one, and got a refund using the Assurant plan that I had purchased.Anyway, I filed the claim, and didn&rsquo;t bother sending this camera back until over a month later. The tracking info never worked on the FedEx website, but the box still reached its destination the next day and I got my refund, which I am using to buy my third Lightdow LD6000 (and another protection plan, of course)!Hopefully I&rsquo;ll stop being so clumsy with these things!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This service worked great !! I purchased this plan for a small action cam that I was worried about dropping, well guess what ? Yep cracked the lens and cam would not power on. It took about 2mins to file a claim on there web site and 10mins after that I had a prepaid return label waiting in my inbox. What really made this nice was the next day I dropped the package off with FedEx and 10:45am an by 1pm that day I had a Amazon Gift card code for the amount of the camera.. Great Service</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a dozen or so items covered by SquareTrade. So far, I&rsquo;ve only had to make three claims, so they&rsquo;ve made a good chunk of change from me.Still, I don&rsquo;t mind it at all because they provide:➔ First class service. Calling in a claim is painless. They don&rsquo;t question you or give any indication that they doubt what you&rsquo;re saying.➔ Replacement comes next business day. My Samsung S3 went out. I was up and running the next day.➔ Full disclosure. You&rsquo;ll likely get a refurb. But I honestly could not tell. They look brand new to me.Concerns?Some people have issues with refurbs. But I weigh the pros and cons this way. By the time you make a claim, you item will be well used. If you claim is due to a drop or some incident where you&rsquo;re at fault, does it really make sense that you get a brand new replacement, especially given that the cost of your plan was a fraction of what the replacement cost would be?I&rsquo;m comfortable with the economics of that.</p>

<p>hello,warranties are like life insurance. it is nice to have but you hope you never have to use it. this is the extra protection for a product that was a gift. it made the recipient very happy to have it along with the new camera. we have purchased many square trade warranties and so far, never had to use any of them. it is a great product to have for your electronics.</p>

<h5 id="came-through-as-advertised">Came through as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a Canon S95 camera, and knowing that I was going to be taking it into the outdoors a good deal, I splurged, hesitantly, on the SquareTrade 2-year camera protection plan (since Canon and other manufacturers&rsquo; warranty only cover defects, not accidents). A year and a couple of months later, I tripped on the trail and fell, splitting open my Camelbak, and drenching the camera inside my pack. Sadly, I packed up the camera and sent it in as instructed by the policy. I was sure that there would be some fine print that would disqualify the camera from coverage&hellip;but instead, they paid for the shipping, sent a number of emails keeping me up-to-date on each step of their warranty process, and in the end, since the camera was damaged beyond repair, they promptly issued a PayPal payment for the full cost of the camera. I was surprised and pleased, and will certainly trust them for further electronics coverage!</p>

<h5 id="fast-and-easy-claims-process">Fast and Easy Claims Process</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We had bad lucks with cameras so when we bought a camera on Amazon we sprang for the extra ~$20 for the SquareTrade 3 yr warranty.32 months into our 36 months warranty period the camera stopped working.I contacted SquareTrade on Monday. I printed a prepaid sticker they provided, boxed up the camera and dropped it off at FedEx on Tuesday morning. The full purchase price for the camera was delivered to my PayPal account on Wednesday. They also have options for an Amazon gift card or mail you a check. PayPal was the most convenient option for us.I was very impressed with how quickly they took care of us and how easy it was to complete the process. I will certainly be purchasing the SquareTrade warranty on our next camera. I highly recommend them for their awesome customer service and value of the service.</p>
