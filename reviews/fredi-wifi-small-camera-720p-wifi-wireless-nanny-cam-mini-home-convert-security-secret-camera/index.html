<h5 id="you-can-hide-this-thing-just-about-anywhere">You can hide this thing just about anywhere&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not the paranoid sort of person. As a matter of fact, my wife says that I an TOO trusting - but there is a big difference between being paranoid and just being informed.For example, I live in a log cabin and the wall between me and the large open room that makes up the &ldquo;common area&rdquo; of the house (the area &ldquo;open to the public&rdquo;) is about 12&rdquo; thick of solid wood so, while I might can hear the television if it is too loud, I can&rsquo;t tell who might be in the house unless they are in my bedroom with me - and that is where a camera like this comes in handy.I have purchased several -&ldquo;hidden camera&rdquo; items made my Fredi and have been very impressed with all of them. What sets this one apart, however, is that it is nor already built into a book ot alarm clock for example but it truly more of a &ldquo;spy camers&rdquo; that can be placed into an existing component of the room (like a wall clock for example) and it would be far less noticeable than if you are assigned an alarm clock or one of thousands much larger &ldquo;security camera&rdquo; type cameras that pan back &amp; forth &amp; tile up &amp; down. (If this were my house than I would install one of those faster than it took the mailman to deliver it!This camera, on the other hand, might take a little longer to &ldquo;install&rdquo; (you can&rsquo;t just set it on the coffee table) but instead it truly the type camera that, if you were to take the time, could be hidden in just about anything.The camera comes in 2 parts. The first part is a rechargeable bap per pack (which can disconnect from the camera assemble) and the camera assembly which consists of the tiny square camera (720P) attached to a long flexible rimming cable and the smack unit that includes a WIFI antenna, a micro-SD card slot, a port for charging the pattern pack, and an on/off switch. The entire unit is basically all the &ldquo;hidden camera&rdquo; portion of what you would find in any devise that would include a hidden camera.Setup couldn&rsquo;t be easier. If you continue already have the ZBVCam software on your phone to use with other devices, simply scan the QR code on the back of the camera and it will take you to the page where you can download it.Setting it up only takes a few minutes. Touch simply connect to the camera as if it were a WIFI hot spot (you only have to do this once) and then you configure it from within the software.In order to conserve battery life (since I am relying entirely on the battery and not keeping it plugged into a power source) I simply turn on the motion detection and then it works just like one of those wild game trail cams, capturing photos or video whenever it detects movement.The camera, once you set up the initial software configuration, is then accessible from anywhere you have an internet connection. All you have to do is to tap the image from the camera (you can name it whatever you like from within the software) and you can not only get a live view from the camera but also enter the configuration and do things like turn on the loop recording so that it will begin to over-write the oldest material once it fills up the 32Gb TF card that is installed.For the purposes of this review I pretended I was part of the.Watergate team and spent less than 5 minutes and a few pieces of scotch tape to install it behind the face of this wall clock. If I had taken the time I could have drilled a small hole in the black portion of the face of the clock (such as in one of the numbers) and such the camera inside it but, so I could give you an idea of how small the camera is, I csimply stuck it out the top of the clock frame as you can see in the second photo.The only thing that I did not like about this particular camera Bu Fredi (and the only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars) is the fact that it lacks sifficient IR lights to capture good photos or video if it were in complete darkness.</p>

<h5 id="small-with-a-crisp-hs-image">Small - with a crisp HS image</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera captures incredible imagery for its size. These are similar to those that youtubers use for pranks, they usually conceal the camera as a button underneath their shirt. Was very easy to set up - and was pleasantly surprised at the crisp image. Seemed to work for a good distance as well without interruption.</p>

<h5 id="easy-setup-up-and-running-in-5-10-mins">Easy setup, up and running in 5-10 mins.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Setup was pretty quick and painless. I&rsquo;m glad you can set a password for it, I was worried anyone could connect that was nearby. I&rsquo;ll have to play around with the sensitivity settings for motion. Works great for our back door, may try to use it as a baby monitor even.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-monitoring-effect-is-very-good-very-clear">the monitoring effect is very good, very clear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has been used for some time, the monitoring effect is very good, very clear, is 1080 HD, monitoring video is stored in segments, each about 5 minutes, it is convenient, night shooting is also good, mobile remote monitoring is very smooth very satisfied</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="need-special-charger">Need special charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon opening the box I noticed that it cannot be charged by using a common phone charger as others are would be nice if it came with a charger adapter or was noted in the comments that it would need one luckily I am familiar with the remote control world and had a multi charger with multi adapters this has the same adapter that is common in your helicopter battery chargers and drones</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="useless-paper-weight">Useless Paper Weight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product was very subpar compared to other WiFi cameras. I also ordered another FREDI camera along with this (the enclosed L16 model) and it was far superior.This camera performs aweful in low light (and I mean low, not dark - as in the lamp in the room did not generate enough light.). After the first few days of use, the light areas in the image would be blown out with colorful blobs around it. Shortly after that started, the camera wire fell off the unit and it is now a useless paper weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-functional">Not functional.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera doesn&rsquo;t function. Charged the battery, followed the instructions, connected it to my network, but my phone will not display video. Will likely try a different brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s good, so low price, you can set it anywhere. And can help you to care your kids too:)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shooting is also very clear.Recommended to buy</p>
