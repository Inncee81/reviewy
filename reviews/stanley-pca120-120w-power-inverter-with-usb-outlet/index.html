<p>Size:600 Peak Amp
The Stanley 300-amp jump starter delivers three hundred amperes of current to a twelve-volt battery for instant startup of your vehicle. The Stanley jump starter works on desulfation technology to provide an instant start. The built-in charger enables you to charge the battery anytime and anywhere on the go. This convenient portable jump starter works equally well for motorbikes, especially in extreme winter conditions and prevents any choking of the battery. The Stanley 300-amp jump starter is small, easy to carry and lighter than many other battery-equipped units. The complete jump starter comes with a heavy-duty metal clamp in an impact-resistant, injection-molded case. (extension cord NOT included)</p>

<h5 id="after-2-short-uses-the-compressor-feature-stopped-working">After 2 short uses, the compressor feature stopped working &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 2 short uses, the compressor feature stopped working. We contacted Stanley and were told that although it is under warranty, we have to pay to have this shipped to them, and they will replace it. It is ridiculous that they will not stand behind their product. We are now trying to work with Amazon to see if we can return it to Amazon at no cost to us.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-jumping-your-vehicle-once-or-twice">GOOD FOR JUMPING YOUR VEHICLE ONCE OR TWICE.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I was the only one that had a unit that failed, I cannot believe that they are still selling this product on Amazon, of course my unit failed after the time frame to return it expired, and the warranty on this product is only one year. I find that hard to believe because it is a Stanley product, I have used their power tools in the past and they usually lasted a long time, why should this one be any different, or so I thought. I have tried charging it off and on at different times and the red light remains constant, it never goes to green or yellow, the light on the side does not come on and the compressor will not make any noise. The cells are dead and I do not know why, this unit should be for emergencies, so the cells should last and be ready to provide a jump if needed. My cars are both new so this unit was not something that was overused or abused. Amazon needs to look into this unit because it is a defective product.</p>

<h5 id="check-that-this-is-right-for-you-before-buying">Check that this is right for you before buying</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to perform as advertised. But as stated in the manual, this will need to be recharged about every month or so or else the battery will go empty and get ruined. You should also note that this does not support trickle charging, so you will need to unplug it when it&rsquo;s done charging to avoid overcharging. This is kind of a hassle, but not that big of a deal. On the other hand, other brands seem to provide trickle charging support. I should also mention that the cables could be longer. These are something like 3-4&rsquo; long.A lot of the negative reviews seem to indicate that this failed to successfully jump a car. Depending on your car, the amps needed to turn the starter over may vary. This should have no problem starting a car with just a low battery or smaller engines (say 4 cylinders), but if the battery is dead or the health of the battery is a problem, then you may fail to start your car.To see if this has enough amps, check on any auto parts store website to see the amp rating for replacement batteries for your vehicle. As an example, let&rsquo;s compare a I4 and V6 2007 Honda Accord. I&rsquo;m using O&rsquo;Reilly Auto for battery comparisons.I4: Cranking Amps range from 555 - 615. This jump starter should have no problems.V6: Cranking Amps range from 665 - 910. It is unlikely that this jump starter can start the car on a dead/dying battery.If you want to play it safe, make sure there&rsquo;s a safety margin between what the jump starter promises and what your battery is rated for. While it might seem somewhat expensive to step up to a higher rated jump starter (say 1000 or 1700 amps), you&rsquo;ll easily make back the difference the first time your car dies and no one is around to help.</p>

<h5 id="didn-t-work-the-first-time-i-needed-to-use-it">Didn&rsquo;t work the first time I needed to use it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charged it up, all ready to go in case of emergency but sadly it didn&rsquo;t work the first time I needed to use it. Not only could I not crank the engine but on troubleshooting there is no voltage/amps using a multimeter across the clamps even though the little worklight could turn on. Called tech support and went through troubleshooting - unit will not hold a charge. Bought in Jan and now it&rsquo;s April so I can&rsquo;t return it through Amazon and the warranty states that the customer has to pay return shipping for warranty service. Basically it&rsquo;s now a very large, very expensive flashlight. If you buy it, test it out before the amazon return period ends. I thought it was charged up because I clicked the battery button and all the battery lights flashed on. According to tech support, you have to hold the battery button down for 10 seconds. If the lights are not still lit at 10 seconds then the unit is not charged. This is not mentioned in the manual at all.</p>

<h5 id="works-but-tire-inflator-top-broke-off-and-unable-to-fix">Works but tire inflator top broke off and unable to fix</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well. It is a bit noisy, though. It has helped in both inflating a number of tires and jump starting my car and some neighborhood cars. Now, after about 2 years of normal use, the top part of the tire inflator has broken off. I looked in home depot for a replacement, nothing seems compatible. I don&rsquo;t want to trash it since it is otherwise working fine.Please help in providing some suggestions/feedback on how to fix this.</p>

<h5 id="not-good-at-all">NOT GOOD AT ALL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this 5 months ago , Used it maybe 7 times for putting air inly tin my riding mower tires and bike tires . Now it&rsquo;s dead and wont take a charge . Was impressed for 5 months. Now I have to find a box , wrap it , pay for shipping , Then wait for a new one . NOT GOOD AT ALL !</p>

<h5 id="returning-after-10-months-and-10-tire-inflations-won-t-inflate-tires-anymore">Returning after 10 months and 10 tire inflations: won&rsquo;t inflate tires anymore.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased in January, used about 10 times to inflate car tires. Unit will no longer inflate tires. Battery still holds a full charge, Sure Fit nozzle connector looks fine and attaches to tire nozzles no problem, Air Pressure gauge on Stanley unit reads <25psi for several different tires on several cars and won't budge after running the unit for >10minutes each tire. Sending unit back while still under warranty.</p>

<h5 id="good-until-the-air-compressor-stopped-working">Good until the air compressor stopped working!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 3 units late 2016. Two for each of my cars, one I gave to a friend. The air compressor for my first one stopped working. It was nice when it worked. Now, I need to contact Baccus Stanley Warranty. I read in lots of other&rsquo;s comments. Stanley will not pay for shipping and handling. It is a heavy item. That s/h will be expensive!!!</p>
