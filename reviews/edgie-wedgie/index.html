<h5 id="if-you-re-paying-for-a-ski-trip-spend-a-few-extra-bucks-on-these-great-teaching-aid">If you&rsquo;re paying for a ski trip, spend a few extra bucks on these&hellip;. Great teaching aid!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I worked at a ski school in Vt for several years and we always kept these in our pockets as an aid. Overall they are great, and fit most types of skis. Sometimes they can leave a mark on skis from the wing nut that tightens them, but anyone with kids will tell you they&rsquo;d trade that for a kid learning to stop.Now ten years later, with my own kids I bought these to help my kids learn. Both my 7 and 5 year old only used them for half an hour before they could stop on their own, and i&rsquo;m sure it made the learning process much faster than it otherwise would have been.Couple of tips:Tie a knot in the middle to make it a little shorter and keep the skis a little closer together.And tighten them down as much as possible by hand, and maybe consider the use of small plyers if you don&rsquo;t have strong hands to keep them from falling off.As the kid is moving, simply tell them to open their legs as far apart as they can, and they will automatically be in a perfect wedge.Can&rsquo;t recommend these enough if you are teaching a kid!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-investment-for-your-child">Great Investment for Your Child</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I see kids struggling to ski I always point to my three year old daughter&rsquo;s Edgie Wedgie. By keeping your tips close together one can improve exponentially and many others use this product within our mountain community. We&rsquo;ve tried other products similar to this (i.e. Velcro and plastic buckles, which are fine) but they take more time to put on and are only limited to one set of skis. These are easy to take on and off, are interchangeable with other skis and do not fall off when your child is tackling Blues and Greens and falls down. Lastly, it allows your child to have more fun on the slopes, which is the ultimate goal.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teaching children to ski with out an Edgie Wedgie is almost cruel and unusual punishment for the parent and the child! We bought this edgie wedgie after numerous recommendations from ski instructors, friends, families and more. We used it to help teach our 4 year old how to ski last season. The result&hellip;.. a happy experience, a progressing beginning skier and parents with their sanity still intact! (Those who have taught your own children how to ski know what I am talking about!).The small investment in an edgie wedgie is literally priceless, they are built well so you can use it with all your kids. Also, no need to worry about sizing because if you find it is allowing your kids skis to spread too wide you can just tie a knot or two in the middle and your problem is solved. It&rsquo;s also light weight and easy to carry so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about carrying it a round, throw it in your ski bag and it&rsquo;s always there.In short, we love our Edgie Wedgie and would recommend it to anyone teaching a child or even an adult how to ski.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I took my son skiing 2 days, for his first time. The first day, he did not use the EW; second day he did. It was easier for him to get up as his skis were always together, it necessitated the correct snowplow &ldquo;pizza&rdquo; form, and I think it helped him a lot. It did come off one time during the day, and it did leave small circle marks in the skis. Would be cool if they came with two non-slip buffers so as not to damage the skis.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="excellent-product-that-gave-my-son-a-lot-of-confidence">Excellent product that gave my son a lot of confidence &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product that gave my son a lot of confidence on the slopes. At first he didn&rsquo;t want to put it on because he thought he could manage without it. But he had trouble getting down the mountain without it; likely because he&rsquo;s only 5 years old and doesn&rsquo;t have the leg strength to do a good wedge. After we put it on, he was able to make it down from top to bottom, including on some milder intermediate runs, without falling. And he&rsquo;s now able to turn and avoid people and other obstacles. These also stay in place very well. In contrast, we also had a set of the Lucky Bums ski connectors, and they did not stay on the skis. I would highly recommend the Edgie Wedgie for any beginner skier.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-for-little-beginner-skiers">Great for little beginner skiers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little accessory! Helped a lot when my 4-year-old began to learn how to ski. He did not have enough of muscle control in his legs to keep position of the plow. With this gadget holding the tips of his skis together, he was able to ski downhill without problems!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="a-bit-disappointed-in-useability">A bit disappointed in useability.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These didn&rsquo;t stay on the ski tips very well. I bought two pairs and found that they helped in communicating the idea of the wedge, but we&rsquo;re not easy to use routinely. They required adjusting after each run for both of my kids. After a few runs, My kids preferred to ski without them and learned quickly to push heels outward to control speed and stop. I would only recommend if child is having difficulty with the concept and if the skis are constant thickness. And tapering in the ski thickness makes these losses easily.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing works great. If you are using this for a kid (mine is 4 going on 5) i recommend tying a knot 1 time to make it smaller. This stayed on with no problem and really did help my little one keeping her skies together.This was recommended to me from a &ldquo;how to teach a child to ski&rdquo; video on youtube.READ MORE</p>
