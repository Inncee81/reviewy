<h5 id="great-cheap-relief-for-tennis-elbow-great-quality-fit">Great cheap relief for tennis elbow - great quality &amp; fit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was diagnosed with tennis elbow by my doctor. He told me to get one of these bands &amp; use on my arm when it hurts or when I do activities that aggravate my arm. Since there are no longer Sports Authority&rsquo;s near us, I looked for one on Amazon. I liked that this one could be wrapped around my arm &amp; adjusted with velcro. I was concerned that it wouldn&rsquo;t fit my arms which are in shape &amp; not super thick. It fits great. I immediately felt relief when I put it on &amp; tightened it. It&rsquo;s good quality &amp; I like having 2. I keep one upstairs &amp; one downstairs so if I feel that my arm is hurting, I can put it on right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fit-great-i-actually-have-to-bring-the-strap-around">fit great! I actually have to bring the strap around &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been searching for a brace that would fit my arm. I had tried all I could find at the various stores that carry these types of products but to no avail. This brace, however, fit great! I actually have to bring the strap around further than normal but because there is only a small label, there is plenty of room to attach the Velcro. As a result, it&rsquo;s the first to fit. My only request is that you make a double pressure brace for those of us who are suffering from both tennis and golfer&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-effective-product">Very effective product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife bought this bracelet for me to help to relieve my tennis elbow. I think this is a must have if you are tennis or golf player and have problems with your elbows. I&rsquo;ve started to feel better after 2 days of wearing this brace. They are very well constructed, perfect size ( it&rsquo;s adjustable), soft inside. Very strongly recommend them.</p>

<h5 id="going-to-my-full-strength-in-the-8-12-rep-range-was-beginning-to-hurt-my-elbows-and-after-my-workouts-i-would-feel-like-my-elbow">Going to my full strength in the 8-12 rep range was beginning to hurt my elbows and after my workouts I would feel like my elbow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tendinitis from working out triceps in the gym for 15 years now. More specifically skull crushers/french presses. Going to my full strength in the 8-12 rep range was beginning to hurt my elbows and after my workouts I would feel like my elbows were going to explode. I guess something to do with the tendon gliding over the bone during the movement? Anyways, I bought these and no more pain. It feels slightly uncomfortable at first during the workout but as I get going and more blood is packed into the triceps from working them in addition to this device, I feel nothing anymore. Plus no pain afterwards. Though I will say I don&rsquo;t wear them like the picture. I wear them above the elbow, not below it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="helps-contain-tennis-elbow-pain">Helps contain tennis elbow pain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this - use for tennis elbow (although I&rsquo;ve never played tennis). I wear one of these while doing any kind of exercising/movement where the tendon flexes, such as golf and crossfit. Because the padding is soft, there is no bruising when I have to close up my arm (like lifting weights). I wear one while kayaking and paddle boarding and even though it gets wet, I let it air dry with no issues. I&rsquo;ve washed it in a regular warm water, cold rinse cycle and let it air dry afterward - still just like brand new. The straps are able to accommodate a pretty good size range - from my somewhat delicate forearm to my husband&rsquo;s more manly muscular one. Combining this with a wrist brace really helps contain the pain of tennis elbow. And having a set of two means I can keep one in my gym bag at all times.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-tennis-elbow-brace">Amazing Tennis Elbow Brace!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have for years fight against the pain I have from tennis elbow. And for years I have tried various remedies including several compression bands and braces. And I have to say that this tennis elbow brace has been one of the most effective tennis elbow treatments I have ever owned. It gives me immediate relief and allows me to continue playing. It is unbelievable the difference this little brace can make! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from tennis elbow but likes to live and maintain an active lifestyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-braces-but-not-for-small-arms">Great braces, but not for small arms</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The braces are very nicely made and satisfactory. However I selected these over other ones because no one had said they didn&rsquo;t fit their small arms. But I do have small arms and they are too large unless I put them on over some clothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-satisfied-with-the-choice-of-these-elbow-braces">I am satisfied with the choice of these elbow braces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am satisfied with the choice of these elbow braces; they look like they are made from high-quality material and have strong stitching. They also do the job of supporting arm&rsquo;s muscles and reduces strain to alleviate pain during the activity. I only played one class and a couple of warm-up games, but I feel they work and my muscle is less sore in the end of the day.</p>
</blockquote>
