<h5 id="works-great-for-hand-eye-coordination-and-building-swing-confidence">Works great for hand - eye coordination and building swing confidence</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This trainer worked great for my two little leaguers. It helped not only with their hand - eye coordination and making sure they kept their eye on the ball when swinging, it also helped them start to understand how to swing through the ball and follow through to hit the ball with more authority. It only took a couple of days of practice with the trainer and their swing improved greatly and they were making more contact and hitting the ball harder than they had been. There may be other methods that would have worked as well without the trainer, but if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend at the field doing drills, you can set this up in the back yard and within minutes the kids will be swinging away and working on fundamentals.My only issue with the trainer I received had to do with the condition when I received it. It comes in two parts, and you slide the top of the pole onto the bottom piece to put it together. Seems pretty simple, but in my case the top half of the pole was bent at the bottom, where it was supposed to slide onto the bottom part of the pole. I had to get out a rubber mallet and an iron rod to bend and reshape the bottom part of the upper pole until I could get it rounded again, so I could fit it together with the bottom half. Once I had that done and together, no other issues, it works great. The base folds up for storage, so I don&rsquo;t envision ever taking it apart again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-effective-but-lacking-replacement-parts">Sturdy, &amp; effective, but lacking replacement parts!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My boys LOVE this gift- &amp; are frequently using it on our limited batting practice area property! It seems to be sturdy construction in general except for the wire cables. After only 3 months use, one of the cables snapped to the dismay of our sons. Thinking they may have worn it out (??), I went online to order a replacement part- &amp; could not find one anywhere available for purchase. For being such a good sturdy product otherwise- that surprised me. I want to give this product 5 stars, but because we couldn&rsquo;t properly fix it, I can&rsquo;t. My husband ended up clamping the original broken cable wires together with a metal clamp. Whenever the manufacturer has replacement parts available- we would still be interested in repairing it properly&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hit-it">Hit it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this for our baseball loving grandson so he could practice his hitting when someone was unavailable to toss him the ball. He loves it and believes his swing has improved! Great item to keep set up in the yard for impromptu practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="most-improved">Most Improved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Grandson got the most improved player this season. As one of the youngest players he had much to learn and he is a bit hard headed. The Hit-a-way was a perfect tool for him. He found it fun to practice, since he did not have to listen to someone trying to help him and he could concentrate on hitting the ball as it came back at him from his last hit. In the last game of the season he got a hit on every at bat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s already helped my 7 year old improve his hand eye coordination in hitting. Definite winner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-hate-relationship">Love hate relationship</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves to hate this piece of equipment! So on one hand he loves it but on the other hand he dislikes it. The replacement cable and ball for some reason had a funny kink in the cable out of the box and when it wraps up it does so in a funny manner. So he yells at it when it does and I tell him that not every pitcher will pitch in the manner all day long to smooth it out with him but the unit shouldn&rsquo;t be this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-training-and-practice-tool-offer-a-bag-for-it">Great training and practice tool. Offer a bag for it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a coach of 3 different baseball teams (ages 8-12) this is a great tool for a variety of ages. It is great for hand-eye coordination, and for older kids, getting them to turn their hips at the proper time. I strongly encourage your player to use a wooden bat on this so you don&rsquo;t take the chance of denting a good alloy bat. I wouldn&rsquo;t use composite since it could crack it. In my practices, I set this up off to the side so the players get plenty of swings before they come to the plate. My only complain is for a bag to carry it because the straps and wheels are fine, but could be better when you have to lug it across a distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-for-tight-spaces-and-practices">Must have for tight spaces and practices</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is awesome! I coach a AAA or youth Majors team, age 12. Originally it was for my son as we live in a condo with limited room to practice. This works great inside the garage. I then started to bring it to our practices. It&rsquo;s very easy to set up and take down and the kids love it. Between this product, a hitting stick, my set of amazing assistance coachs and a 12 y/o boy who can throw 62mph strikes we are 6-0 so far this season. Most of the coachs and parents want one for their home. That is this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow-awesome">WOW!!! AWESOME!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW!!! AWESOME!!! I wasn&rsquo;t sure when I first started to look into this BUT it is GREAT! My ten year old plays competitive baseball and he practiced with this for hours. First day.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t swing the ball around smoothly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="horrible-product-was-damaged-when-it-arrived">HORRIBLE! Product was damaged when it arrived</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>HORRIBLE! Product was damaged when it arrived. Could not put it together. Two poles would not fit into each other. Would not buy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-training-tool">Good training tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a coach and baseball dad. My boys whack the crap out of this all year (in the house in the winter).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-has-drawbacks">OK. has drawbacks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works Ok. I had an older version that had rope attached to ball and it swung effortlessly around pole. This cable doesn&rsquo;t seem to work as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-son-is-7-and-loves-hitting-on-this">My son is 7 and loves hitting on this. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son is 7 and loves hitting on this. He will stand outside for about an hour hitting. It&rsquo;s helped him to start watching the ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-go-well-with-grandson-it-wasn-t-what-he-thought">Did go well with grandson it wasn&rsquo;t what he thought &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did go well with grandson it wasn&rsquo;t what he thought it would b .it raps it self around the pole then someone has 2 throw it back so he can hit it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good training tool</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kid only used it once. So&hellip; if you need one, I&rsquo;ll sell it <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> price.</p>
