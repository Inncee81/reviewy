</ul>

<p>This Munchkin dining set has everything you need to encourage your Tiny Diner to try solid foods and (eventually) start self-feeding. Pack includes a set of 3 Lil&rsquo; Apple plates and 6 Lift Infant Spoons. Lil&rsquo; Apple plates have deep sides and dividers to keep foods separate to help little ones scoop to their hearts&rsquo; content. And the fresh apple design and bright colors keep mealtime fun for even the pickiest eaters. The Lift Infant Spoons have tips that do not touch countertops when set down, and are made of soft plastic that is gentle on baby&rsquo;s gums. The shallow spoon bowl even makes it easy for your little novice to eat. Ready, set, feed with ease.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="the-apple-shaped-plates-are-a-hit">The apple shaped plates are a hit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We like it. The plates are 3 cheerful colors and the apple shape just adds to the little ones curiosity to eat. The divisions are useful to separate food. My 2 yr old is specific about how her food should not touch the gravy or the fruit an this helps a lot (instead of having individual bowls for veggies and rice for example) They are also dishwasher and microwave safe which is easy for us mommy&rsquo;s. The spoons are geared more towards infants so we don&rsquo;t use the spoon much to scoop food off the plate.i would have liked it if they gave 3 spoons and 3 forks instead of 6 spoons but that&rsquo;s just my opinion and hence the 4 stars. We use her regular spoon/fork instead. The price i think is right for the 9 piece set. We are a happy customer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-beat-the-price-unless-you-don-t-need-the-spoons">Can&rsquo;t beat the price&hellip;unless you don&rsquo;t need the spoons</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2-year-old loves these apple-shaped plates! He gets excited when I take them out. I like that the plate is divided into portions just like our ezpz Mini Mat - One-piece silicone placemat + plate (Blue), One Size. For example, we will serve him cheese and crackers int the smaller slots and fruits in the larger area. Unlike the ez pz mat, the Munchkin plates also don&rsquo;t suction but I&rsquo;ve found many similar plates saying they offer this feature really don&rsquo;t as it&rsquo;s all dependent on your high chair, table, etc.The spoons are definitely perfectly sized an infant, as stated, but for a toddler you&rsquo;re going to have to upgrade to some proper toddler spoons. If you don&rsquo;t need the spoons, check out the spoon-less version: Munchkin Lil&rsquo; Apple Divided Toddler Plates, 3 Count, which is very reasonably priced and affordable.Somehow on the packaging I received, which may just be for Amazon Vine, it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me that the plates were microwave safe. They are really easy to store compared to my ez pz mats, which take up a LOT of room, sitting on a shelf all by themselves. I haven&rsquo;t used the dishwasher to wash these and usually wash these by hands.Also, we keep kosher so having separate colors for meat, dairy and pareve is very useful. I can also see these being repurposed as an artist&rsquo;s palette once the portions are too small for a bigger kid.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="spoons-are-fine-dislike-the-plates">Spoons are fine, dislike the plates.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set contains 3 plates and six spoons.I like the spoons. I am serving my 3rd child solids for the first time. Previously, I&rsquo;d used Munchkin soft tip spoons, and those spoons were fine. These I like more, because they are a bit bigger and flatter. This child is a bigger eater, and likes to hold the spoon herself, and these work well for that.I don&rsquo;t like the plates much. They feel flimsy. Unlike other brands I&rsquo;ve used, there is no rubber or suction on the bottom that keeps these plates from sliding around. This is annoying, not just because baby can toss the plate off the table easily, but also for me, as I like to be able to stir food on baby&rsquo;s plate, sometimes to mix it up, or to cool it off. When I try to stir on these plates, they slide around the table. And the partitions are not deep enough for baby to practice her utensil skills on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="durable-practical-and-just-cute">Durable, practical, and just cute!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this set for my 2yo granddaughter to use, and the first thing I noticed (since they ended up on the floor at one point) is how durable they are. I also saw how much she liked having each of her lunch items separate, and the shape and bright colors are just cute. I like that the spoons are made to avoid touching the counter, but honestly, little kids will still probably splat the spoon onto counters/high chair trays anyway. And about the spoons - these are probably not advanced enough for a toddler, but she does prefer these spoons when eating yogurt (but they are largely useless for breakfast cereal, etc). Bonus points for these being dishwasher safe (a must!).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adorable-colorful-and-don-t-slide-all-over-the-place-on-the-high-chair-tray">Adorable, colorful, and don&rsquo;t slide all over the place on the high chair tray. :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These plates are the perfect size for the high chair tray. They are really cute, colorful, and they don&rsquo;t slide all over the tray.The dividers are nice and high, and there&rsquo;s no risk of spillover. For my grandson, this is a real issue. ;)The spoons are short, and they have squared off leading edges. I haven&rsquo;t seen any benefit to this, but it&rsquo;s worth noting. It is easier to scoop the dribble from baby&rsquo;s mouth with the flat edge.I really like these, and think most parents and grandparents would find them to be go-tos for the babies in their lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-but-strong">Cute but strong</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, this is a great dining set. The apple design is not only cute but useful &ndash; the food slots are deep enough to keep food from &ldquo;escaping&rdquo; while scooping. The dishes and spoons are both colorful, stylish and solid &ndash; the bowls will take a few drops without damage.The plates work fine in the microwave; the label says all pieces are dishwasher safe, but I can&rsquo;t attest to that as we don&rsquo;t really use the dishwasher much.This is a well-designed and well-constructed dining set. I can&rsquo;t really think of anything that would improve it. Good price, too. Five stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-well-should-last-roughly-forever">Work well&hellip;should last roughly forever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sized plates for the young ones, plenty of &ldquo;extra&rdquo; spoons, and good sized compartments in the plates. We use these daily - the kids like using them, they&rsquo;re easy to clean and also stack well in the cupboard. All in all, we&rsquo;re very happy with these&hellip; I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;d buy them again, but they are built well and the plastic isn&rsquo;t going to break anytime soon, so we may not need to buy more at all. Recommended - the only downside (compared to others we have is they don&rsquo;t have the antiskid or suction on the bottom&hellip; but then again, that&rsquo;s not always desired.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dishwasher-and-microwave-safe-woohoo">Dishwasher and microwave safe, woohoo!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The infant spoons are great for feeding infants, but not for self-feeding (the handles end up being too long). I do love that they don&rsquo;t touch whatever surface they are resting on&ndash;what a brilliant idea. And you get 6 of them, which is plenty.The plates are great for finger foods for my toddler. No foods have to touch, and they&rsquo;re the perfect size for portions and fit in my dishwasher nicely. I will be buying more of these plates since it comes with 3 and I would like a few more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-to-eat-off-of">Fun to eat off of</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these! Super cute colors and the spoons are a nice addition. These plates wash up and store easily. My daughter love the bright colors and the divided sections.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-love-love-these-plates">Love, love, love these plates!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These apple plates are my favorite thing in a long time!! They&rsquo;re adorable, they wash up so well, they stack together, &amp; my daughter loves using them!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-great-well-made-and-beautiful-bright-colors">These are great! Well made and beautiful bright colors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great! Well made and beautiful bright colors. My little guy always dumps his plate onto his high chair tray but he will actually eat off of These!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="why-wouldn-t-you-want-to-eat-off-an-apple">Why Wouldn&rsquo;t You Want to Eat Off an Apple?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean if I were a kid I would much rather &ldquo;eat off an apple&rdquo; as my toddler says than a ceramic plate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-set">great set!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are excellent products. The plates are thick, sturdy, and clearly very durable. The apple shape is very cute, but it is actually also practical, as the apple leaf works as&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-plate-spoon-set">Great plate/spoon set!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are excellent divided baby plates. The apple design is very cute, and the colors are bright and bold (my son insisted on eating from the yellow plate only).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-dinner-set">Cute dinner set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these plates, and am so glad I was able to get these. The plates fit food nicely in each compartment. The plates comes in 3 bright colors: red, yellow, and green.</p>
