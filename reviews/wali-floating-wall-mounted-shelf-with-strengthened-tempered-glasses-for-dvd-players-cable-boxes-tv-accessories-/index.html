<h5 id="surprisingly-helpful-instructions-easy-to-install">Surprisingly helpful instructions, easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The instruction manual is actually helpful! Step 1 clearly says to use <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; drill bit to make long enough hole. I wish every set of instructions specified the size of the drill bit. It&rsquo;s so nice not have to guess at the instructions. The 3 shelves can actually be installed as 2 shelf and 1 shelf if needed, and it&rsquo;s pretty clear to do so without the instructions. Once all the screws are tightened, the shelves are snug, no wobble. I haven&rsquo;t put anything too heavy, just cable box, modem, router, and a laptop, across all three shelves.Only thing the instructions could improve on are the translations (sometimes tells to tighten four screws when there are three shelves), but that is minor. It seems the front page was carefully edited since it deals with putting holes in the wall, while the back page has more mistakes, since it is all with adjustments and cosmetic parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="straight-forward-and-good-value">Straight Forward and Good Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is EXACTLY what it says it is in the description. It&rsquo;s easy to hang and assemble. It does everything it is supposed to and nothing that it doesn&rsquo;t. Arrived in good order, instructions were clear, packaging simple. Done. Wife loves it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-kind-of-hate-it">I kind of hate it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I needed something to hang my Samsung 4K player, Xbox One and my Denon home theater. When I got it, it looked a lot smaller than what I anticipated.I installed it, which was fairly easy and once I started putting everything on I realized it&rsquo;s just not what I needed. First, the home theater is a little wider but WALI is not going to hold it. The glass shelves started to tilt to the side, and I thought maybe I needed to screw it tighter and it was as tight as it can be.So I took it off, and went to Samsung 4K player which is also wide but not as wide as the Denon and most definitely not as heavy. I plugged in the my Monster Black Platinum HDMI and it pushes it back from the wall. The HDMI is a lot thicker and won&rsquo;t go into the slots dedicated for HDMI and other wires.This isn&rsquo;t made for higher quality items, it&rsquo;s made for much smaller DVD players, and other small electronics. In my opinion, not worth $29.99.I now have to look for a replacement, something much wider and hold heavier electronics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-improved-design">Great improved design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great improved design. Waiting for Amazons Kanto and Videosecu to advise how to hide the wires with Arlington Imdustries boxes, in wall, before buying either ones fully adjustable 35-70 mount and doing the full install of both. Whoever replies first. Whoever replies 1st gets the order. Will continue the review then.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality product. I have a wall mounted tv, needed a shelve for my cable box. This shelf is easy to install and looks good. Exactly what I needed. Shelf height is adjustable on the wall bracket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-not-great">Not bad, not great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not bad, not great. the pictures make it look like the ribbing in the back is part of the support but it&rsquo;s not. the ribbing is a simple insert placed there simply for appearance (no functionality). the buttons that snap in to cover the screws did not snap in. When pushed too hard as I did they push through the hole and wedge in the housing. No harm, no foul, they are not needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="surprisingly-i-like-it-works-with-what-we-needed-it-for">Surprisingly I like it. Works with what we needed it for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly I like it. Works with what we needed it for. The only thing is the way our TV is hung takes two studs. So we couldn&rsquo;t put the floating mount in the middle of the hung tv. Instead we put two shelves on bottom left stud and one shelf on bottom right stud in the middle of the other two under the hung tv. Looks pretty neat. Ended up keeping it and hanging it in a different way. Glad we purchased it and it works for our game systems, cable box, and such.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these little shelves! Bought them to store our laptops on so that they are out of the way and they work perfect for this! They are perfect size and easy to use! So very please with this purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="low-profile-design-is-nice-easy-to-hang">Low profile design is nice. Easy to hang</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some parts dont fit well together. The hex screws have paint on the inside of the socket, which doesn&rsquo;t allow the wrench to slide into the socket. I had to dig out the paint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-for-the-cost">Excellent product for the cost!</h5>

<p>Easy to put up - solidly made looks good</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-and-sleek">REALLY NICE AND SLEEK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>REALLY NICE AND SLEEK. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE BACK OF WHERE YOURE SUPPOSE TO RUN THE CORDS WAS SLIM COULDNT RUN ALOT OF CORDS THRU IT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT LOOKS GREAT.</p>
