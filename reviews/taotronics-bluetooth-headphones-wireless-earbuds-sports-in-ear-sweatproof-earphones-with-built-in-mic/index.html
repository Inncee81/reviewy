<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are better than the other pair of TaoTronics headphones I bought (and returned). They connect quickly to my iphone, sound quite decent, and are a good deal for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First pair of Bluetooth headphones I&rsquo;ve ever used. I bought these for listening to music while I ride my atv on national forest trails. I&rsquo;m impressed with the sound quality, and how long the charge last. The description said they should be good for about six hours of continuous use. I easily exceeded that yesterday. The Bluetooth connects to my phone quicker and easier than all of my other Bluetooth devices. I&rsquo;m super happy with these things. Makes my riding a lot more enjoyable. Exceeded my expectations. Easy to use, too. I absolutely recommend these. You can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-nice-sound-and-comfortable-to-wear">Really nice sound and comfortable to wear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice sound and comfortable to wear. Easy to pair. I got these to use while watching tv because I need the sound turned up high, but that can sometimes bother others in the house. Now I can watch tv or listen to music without disturbing others in the room and without missing what is being said on the tv! Great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="greatest-among-other-headphones-with-comparable-price-range">Greatest among other headphones with comparable price range.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The headphones look nice, well packaged. Actually the I kept the box because it looks nice.Color: the color I received was bright green, not a big fan of the color, I usually like my headphones black so they are more discrete.Sound Quality: its very nice, but don&rsquo;t expect something to blow you away. its good for watching videos and listening to some kind of music.price: was very reasonable considering I had a coupon</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-gym">Perfect for gym</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: battery life sucks. Only got maybe 6 hrs before I had to charge again. Last earbuds lasted twice as long.After a rocky start due to user error, the second use went much smoother. I use these at the gym and once I attached the hooks, they stayed in my ears during both my lifting sessions and my HIIT sprints. I&rsquo;m not an audiophile so I&rsquo;m not going to nitpick about sound or anything - they are perfect for my use. The buttons are easy to use. I&rsquo;m not sure about phone functions yet but I rarely talk on the phone at the gym anyway. Very happy with these Earbuds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-sound-is-good-enough-for-what-i-do-and-because-they-shut">The sound is good enough for what I do and because they shut &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these for workouts with lots of movement (kickboxing, step, lifting) and they don&rsquo;t come out. They come with oval ear pieces or the wings. The wings are what I use to keep them in securely. The sound is good enough for what I do and because they shut out a good amount of ambient sound, I don&rsquo;t have to turn my music up so high on my phone. Really love these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound-quality-and-comfortable-fit">Great sound quality and comfortable fit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far they&rsquo;re great. I&rsquo;ve had them for a week and the connection is great and easily synced up with my phones bluetooth. They comfortable to wear and have plenty of spare ear buds to change if they&rsquo;re not. The charge time is great I only had to charge them once so far from the time I opened them from the box. They are sound dampening, not noise cancelling, but that&rsquo;s perfect for me for when I use them to go running and I need to still kind of hear what&rsquo;s going on in my surroundings anyway. I would recommend these and I&rsquo;ll update my review again later after sometime of use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-comfortable-durable">These are comfortable, durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are comfortable, durable, easy to use and over-all great for the price point. They are definitely designed for kids&rsquo; music however. Very bass-heavy, this can be compensated to some extent with your eq settings. For the electronic boom-boom of today&rsquo;s pop they would be good. For acoustic or more sophisticated, layered compositions, they tend to run on the thin side sound wise on midrange and high end. Still, for the price they are very nice. I received a coupon code which reduced my purchase price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work great and the price was great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-headphones">Best Headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the heck out these headphones! And I also love that I got them on sell. I&rsquo;ll be purchasing another pair soon for the hubby!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-but-doesn-t-last-long">Good product, but doesn&rsquo;t last long</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is now the second pair of TaoTronics headphones that I&rsquo;ve purchased. They fit well and worked well for a variety of athletic activities, and I hoped that they would be a good&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good headphones but too big for my ears. Even with the smallest tip they wouldn&rsquo;t stay in. :(</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-good-bluetooth-ear-buds">These are good Bluetooth ear buds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good Bluetooth ear buds. They are the. First pair I have bought, so I don&rsquo;t have any to compare them to, but they work very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product-but">Nice product, but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The headphones themselves are really nice. Unfortunately, they hurt my ears. I&rsquo;ve tried using the different size ear pieces but they do not help.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="purchased-it-a-year-ago-and-it-always-worked-amazing-after-one-year-it-stopped-working">&hellip; purchased it a year ago and it always worked amazing. After one year it stopped working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased it a year ago and it always worked amazing. After one year it stopped working. I contacted support and they sent me replacement for defective.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">Do not buy</h5>

<h5 id="good-earphones-but-they-stopped-working">Good earphones, but they stopped working.</h5>

<p>I received these as a gift in December 2016 and loved them for their listenability. One earphone just stopped working and since they were a gift, I don&rsquo;t know if I can claim&hellip;</p>
