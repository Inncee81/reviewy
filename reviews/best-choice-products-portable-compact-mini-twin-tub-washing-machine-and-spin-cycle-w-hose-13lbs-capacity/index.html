<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to sum up my experience with this washer and also share a few tips and tricks that I have learned.1. It is SUPER powerful and will get your clothes far cleaner than any washer you&rsquo;ve had before, you just have to do smaller loads. Whites comes out whiter with no bleach than they used to in standard washer having used bleach.2. It is the opposite of what I was expecting in terms of build quality. I was expecting a more solid-feeling build quality, but shoddy performance. It&rsquo;s the other way around. It looks kind of chintzy in person (the knobs and such mostly) but man is it powerful!3. It has a 15 minute wash cycle, but anything past 6-9 minutes is seldom needed. It&rsquo;s so powerful that lightly soiled loads I only wash for about 3 minutes.4. This thing will save you water5. This thing will save you LOTS of soap6. The plastic it&rsquo;s made from does have a funny smell that takes quite a while to go away. Not a terrible smell, just strange.7. The instructions are garbage, read below on how to best operate this machineLet me make sure and state that I have NOT in any way shape or form been paid or given a discount for my review. I&rsquo;m just a satisfied buyer. It&rsquo;s a really cool little gadget that is only slightly bigger (mostly wider) than a standard large sized laundry hamper. In fact I store it where our hamper used to go and I store the liquid detergent inside the machine. Everyone I&rsquo;ve showed it to has wanted a demo of how it works and has been amazed with it. In fact my family (myself, wife, and daughter) liked it so much that the first weekend we washed more clothes than we had in ages just because we were having fun with it. So, I won&rsquo;t make the review super long winded but just want to say that for the price I paid I&rsquo;m super satisfied with the little machine. It&rsquo;s small enough to put inside a camper or bring to a cabin (or even a hotel room if you really wanted to).OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS (aka, what I&rsquo;ve learned from personal experience)1. The water inlet on the upper left side is for filling the wash tub. You can hook up a water inlet there or just fill with a bucket or hose. I decided to make my own adapter to make it super easy (more on that later). The water inlet on the upper right side is for rinsing your clothes while they are in the spin dryer. Most people on here seem to run a separate rinse cycle by draining the wash tub then refilling it with water but that&rsquo;s not necessary.Place the washing machine inside a bathtub for easiest use, unless you have a dedicated spot with a water supply and drain for it to go. Don&rsquo;t forget to unhook the drain hose from the side and point it toward the drain.2. Put a teaspoon or so (5-10ml) of liquid laundry detergent into the wash tub (left side hatch). Put3. Fill the wash tub to the appropriate level for however much you&rsquo;re washing (usually just enough to submerge about 75% of the laundry pile)4. Rotate wash dial to your choice of minutes (I do 9 for heavily soiled, 3 for lightly soiled, but your mileage may vary).5. When wash cycle is complete switch the dial to DRAIN and let it drain then take a few items at a time and drop them into the spin dryer. Close the lid then turn on the water supply to the right side inlet and set the dryer to spinning. Let it spin for 20-30 seconds with the water running then turn the water off. After that somewhere between 30 seconds to 3 minutes will get most items quite dry. Jeans and really heavy items may unbalance the dryer and you may have to reorient them. The dryer takes a little while to get used to but after 2-3 loads you&rsquo;ll find you can have the whole batch you just washed mostly dry and ready to go on the line, back of a chair, or in a regular drier for a couple of minutes, in well under 5 minutes of work.That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Oh, and to make life much easier if you already have a shower with a shower wand go to the hardware store (look in my pictures) and purchase a 1/2inch male to 5/8inch tubing fitting. Grab some 5/8inch tubing and cut it about 3-5 inches long then jam the fitting into one end and place the open end of the tube onto one of the washer&rsquo;s inlets. The 1/2inch fitting should allow you to simply unscrew your shower wand and attach directly to that. Then just swap the setup from one inlet to the other when going from wash to rinse.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="so-happy-i-got-this">So happy I got this!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received my washer today!!!! Love love love!!!!! It&rsquo;s the perfect size, very easy set up!!! I&rsquo;ve already done 4 loads today! It looks great and works even greater!!!! Don&rsquo;t hesitate, just buy it!!! It&rsquo;s perfect here for my little tiny apt!!! It actually fits right on my kitchen counter and just drains into the sink!!! It&rsquo;s very powerful, and my clothes are clean!!!! And the spin dryer is incredible, takes out about 90% of the water!!! I&rsquo;m impressed, and so happy I got this!!!!Update: so it&rsquo;s been about 6 weeks, still going strong!!! I now just sit in in the bathtub, much easier to drain and fill that way!!! I have a removable shower head I just put in it to fill&hellip;I also bought the Panda portable dryer to use as well!! But my clothes dry so quick air drying I have only used it once! But it works great too!! Very quiet!!!Update: whew, freaked out because I thought it had just died!!!! Lol, after tinkering around for an hr, I realized that the switch on the power strip was off!!!!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="anazing-for-price-just-buy-it">Anazing for price - just buy it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should have bought this way sooner. I have to pay 1.50 for laundry and 1.25 for the dryer in my apartment building and people are always leaving their stuff in there for days and always had to go get quester so I was fed up and turned to amazon of course. I&rsquo;m glad I went with this size instead of a larger one. It fits in my bath tub and holds a decent amount of clothes. Perfect size for doing a load of whites and colors from about a week or two of clothes. I really wanted something just for my workout clothes instead of paying to wash them every other day but it has worked out for everything from duvet cover, sheets, towels, everything!! I tip mine over and stick it under the bathtub faucet to fill it up. Easy peasy. It did take me a few spinner drys to figure out that the white plastic circle goes ON TOP of the clothes haha I guess that&rsquo;s what I get for not reading directions. The wash and spinner are pretty quiet. The spinner gets my underwear and bras completely dry. Everything else I just hang up and is dry by morning. Towels and sheets I spin twice for the full time. I haven&rsquo;t found a need to really have to use softener either. Just buy it!!!!! Game changer.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="impressive-washing-machine">Impressive washing machine!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first glance, it looks like part of a children&rsquo;s home play set.But WOW WOW WOW it is very impressive, it&rsquo;s a bit labor intensive because it washes so quick and efficient. The spinner was easy to figure out very quickly. Heavy at the bottom lighter at the top. Its been great! I am beyond impressed by this little washing machine. It&rsquo;s perfect for an apartment. I have been excited to show friends and family how well it works. I followed another gentleman&rsquo;s post and made a water connection via sch 40 PVC and valves and its like having a regular washing machine minus the automation. I haven&rsquo;t even had it a week yet!Update: 10 days of using, multiple cycles, I recommend a cycle of warm water and bleach to sanitize and kill odors, otherwise it has still been a great product. Already went through a 25 load bottle of laundry detergent. Its paid for itself already.READ MORE</p>

<p>the size is not as you see it in the photo, it does not have a hair collector therefore you have to take care that because it blocks your pipes, you can wash three jeans&hellip;</p>
