<p>Rain Bird ST8I-WIFI Smart Irrigation Indoor WiFi Sprinkler System Timer/Controller, 8-Zone. The Rain Bird Smart Irrigation WIFI Timer places control of your sprinkler system in the palm of your hand while saving time, water, and money. The Rain Bird app allows control of multiple timers located anywhere in the world; install app on multiple devices, or securely share control with family members and landscapers. Compatible with: Apple iOS 8 or greater, and Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later. Connect to timer programming functions via: mobile device through a WIFI network, even away from home; directly from mobile device when in range; or through timer’s front control panel. It’s simple to customize watering schedules which can be automatically adjusted all year. Each watering zone may be set with a different name, picture, frequency, start time, and run time to ensure healthy plants and a lower water bill. Automatic Seasonal Adjust feature will adjust daily watering schedule based on season, local weather, temperature, and humidity. This data automatically downloads for your specific zip code and is calculated every night. Each zone is customizable for Watering Days, Start Times and Run Time: allowing watering on custom days of week, odd or even calendar days, or cyclic (every 1-14 days), 6 Start Times per zone, and Run Times from 0-199 minutes. All timer settings are stored indefinitely in memory; no need to re-program in case of power outage. Enabling Notifications in the Rain Bird app keeps you informed of what’s happening in your yard even when you’re away from home. Know when someone enables a watering delay; Automatic Seasonal Adjust is applied; date or time is incorrect; timer disconnects from WIFI network; valve malfunctions; or of a possible freeze. Watering Delay feature allows you to suspend watering for 1 to 14 days; normal programming resumes automatically once selected delay has ended. Connects to a master valve or pump start relay and supports a wired Rain Sensor to automatically turn timer off when it rains (rain sensor model CPRSDBEX sold separately). Compatible with most 24 VAC irrigation valves. Sealed case protects from moisture, insects and grime; timer designed for use in a weather resistant location like a garage or waterproof shed. Includes transformer with 6’ cord, mounting hardware, and installation guide. Rain Bird “The Intelligent Use of Water”</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-and-program">easy to install and program</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>easy to install and program. Programming instructions could have been a little more clear, but I figured out how to do it pretty quickly. I&rsquo;m a homeowner and not a professional landscaper.Controller worked fine for about 5 weeks and then I could no longer control zones and ultimately, it quick working in any zone. Since I was away, the yard dried up and had to replace the controller!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reasonable-but-lacking-some-needed-functions">Reasonable, but lacking some needed functions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This controller is a replacement for an existing 10 year old controller. It was pretty straight-forward to install in place of the old controller, set up the wifi connection, pair with the phone, and operating remotely to start and stop the zones independently. Had to call Rain Bird for assistance but they were quick and helpful. Added a second phone and that went well also.Rather disappointed that doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to group the zones (say, watering the front yard one morning, and the back yard the next morning). That seems a little primitive, since we could easily do this with our old &ldquo;manual / non-wifi controller&rdquo; before it failed.Also disappointed that we can&rsquo;t manually run all zones at a given percentage with a single command. As far as I can tell, I have to enter each zone, reduce the time, run it - and then repeat for all the zones in our yard. That also is pretty clumsy, and would be a very useful feature for me.If it could handle those tasks, we&rsquo;d probably give it a 5-star.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="met-my-expectations">Met my expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I installed the controller on my own, found it very easy to replace the existing controller with this one, Rain Bird did not change or improve the existing functions, I was expecting more flexibilty like different watering durations for each watering time of the zone, you have to stick with a single duration for morning, afternoon or night yet this flexibilty must be very easy to provide I guess through software. Built quality is ok, wifi is very stable, I cannot use weather function since I use it outside USA. One issue is when I cancel the watering, this is not updated on the calender, so need some improvements.It&rsquo;s realy very usefull to control the unit anytime anywhere remotely, wheather conditions may change suddenly outside forecasts where I live and now I have the full control.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-easy-to-replace-with-my-old-mechanical-rain-bird">Super easy to replace with my old mechanical rain bird &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed. Super easy to replace with my old mechanical rain bird water timer. Easy set up, easy app to use. Super easy, I can water my yard from anywhere any time. As long as I have cell coverage or internet. Very Cool!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="intial-app-connectivity-is-a-bit-slow-everything-else-is-great">Intial app connectivity is a bit slow, everything else is great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and set up. I&rsquo;ve never used the controller to program, only programmed via the Rainbird app. The app is easy to use though slow to initially communicate to the controller and loses connection with the controller if you exit the app or open a second app and return to it. Doesn&rsquo;t run in the background.Additionally within the app, manual watering is tedious as you can only slide a bar to set the time and it&rsquo;s hard to slide to the exact desired time.Overall, having the ability to connect to the controller wirelessly on my smart phone is fantastic!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-advertised">Not as advertised.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Setup and operation seem to be pretty straight forward, which is good because the documentation sucks. I&rsquo;m giving this product 2 stars because the sharing feature, which is why I bought this device, is difficult to impossible to implement. I have yet to be able to set up the sharing and the customer service rep I just talked to provided very little help. I am not giving up yet, but I am unlikely to buy a Rain Bird associated &ldquo;smart&rdquo; product again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-able-to-program-monitor-my-sprinkler-form-anywhere-set-up-was-pretty-easy">Works well. Able to program/monitor my sprinkler form anywhere. Set up was pretty easy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works fine. Interface is very simple. Was able to connect up to our wifi network within about 10 minutes. Now able to control our sprinklers from anywhere. The app that goes with this is fine, although a bit light on features. Still, it works well. No need to walk t the box anymore. It&rsquo;s all on my iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The WIFI feature and the app for your phone makes this very user friendly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine-lots-of-features">Works fine - lots of features.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t understand some of the negative reviews. This timer was simple and easy to install, and setup with the app is straight forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="phone-app-isn-t-great-but-otherwise-great">Phone App isn&rsquo;t great but otherwise, great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Could be 5 star if the phone app was more user friendly. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s fine&hellip; it just could be better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="extremely-easy-to-set-and-run-schedules">Extremely easy to set and run schedules</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely easy to set and run schedules. I&rsquo;ve had the controller installed for an entire season now and have had zero issues with it. Extremely happy with this product.</p>

<h5 id="was-easy-to-hook-up-and-connect-to-internet">Was easy to hook up and connect to internet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was easy to hook up and connect to internet. Only problem I have is remotely you have to run each zone individually in stead of running a specific program which may contain&hellip;</p>

<p>Works great! Able to set or start anywhere</p>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent.</h5>

<p>4 weeks and works great. Easy to set-up and does even more then I assumed it would. Love it.</p>

<p>Not that impressive. As a Rainbird installer I was expecting better. Basic clock with the wi-fi module added on. Would not buy again.</p>

<h5 id="rain-bird">Rain Bird</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>replace an old unit works great around the house but having trouble connecting online when far away from home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="potentially-great-but-inexplicable-auto-adjustment-and-poor-support">Potentially great but inexplicable auto adjustment % and poor support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very fair price and is relatively easy to install and setup. Also has been reliable in terms of working and staying connected to the Internet, and is easy to manually control&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-to-do-when-replacing-new-router-with-this-device">what to do when replacing new router with this device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow!, This unit has saved me many steps back and forth from the defective solonoids on the sprinkler head in testing. Worth the money just for that.</p>
