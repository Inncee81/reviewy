<h5 id="o2-vibe-used-for-sleep-apnea-aid">O2 Vibe used for Sleep Apnea aid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used this brilliantly designed device for 3 months to measure my blood oxygen saturation levels and heart rate while I sleep. It is invaluable to me to monitor how effectively my CPAP monitor is treating my sleep apnea. Sometimes the apnea monitor is not able to keep my airway open, leading to a drop in blood oxygen saturation level which I can see the magnitude of and time it occurred on a graph on my iPhone or on the BodiMetrics website. The O2 Vibe does not require a smartphone to actually record the data, but rather is a completely, self-contained recording device. I sync the data from the O2 Vibe with my iPhone in the morning with the BodiMetrics APP via a Bluetooth connection. The O2 Vibe has a thumb sensor with a short cord to it which makes it the most convenient and comfortable device on the market that I know of. There is no long cord connected to a device on the nightstand. I simply put it on my wrist like a watch, connect the thumb sensor, and press the only button on the device to start recording. That&rsquo;s it. Perhaps the most valuable feature is the ability to set a minimum oxygen saturation level threshold that activates a vibration alarm in the thumb sensor to wake me up whenever my oxygen saturation goes below the threshold. This gives me peace of mind that my blood oxygen saturation level never goes below a potentially harmful level. This is a great device and I highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="device-works-well-user-instructions-and-support-are-poor">Device works well! User instructions and support are poor.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had planned to return the BodiMetrics O2 Vibe because I got error messages saying it wasn&rsquo;t a supported device when I tried to pair with either iPhone or iPad. It had worked a few times when I first got it. I think either the App or electronics had been updated when the Bluetooth pairing problem started. I really wanted to love the O2 Vibe, so I kept trying to connect it. I discovered the Bluetooth connection really WAS working, despite the message saying it wasn&rsquo;t. It was capturing data AND uploading it to the BodiMetrics account I had set up.The documentation for this product is poor to non-existent. All I have found is the Quick Start Guide that comes with the product. It is 8 tiny pages that didn&rsquo;t provide enough info for me. There are no FAQs on the BodiMetrics web site or the Amazon Market supplier&rsquo;s site. Through experimentation, I found that the device doesn&rsquo;t have to be Bluetooth connected to the phone or iPad to collect data, only to upload the data to the cloud for long-term storage. The O2 Vibe stores data for only 4 monitoring sessions, then the oldest data is overwritten. If you only wear the O2 Vibe when sleeping, you would only need to Bluetooth connect and upload data every 4 days. I upload daily because I want to see how I slept the night before. There is another reason to NOT keep the O2 Vibe Bluetooth connected all the time.When connected, all you will see on the O2 Vibe display is a connection symbol. You will have to look at your phone or other Bluetooth device to see heart rate and SpO2. When NOT Bluetooth connected, you can glance at the O2 Vibe on your wrist to see heart rate and SpO2.The BodiMetrics O2 Vibe is not a good fitness monitor - compared to many other fitness trackers on the market. You must be wearing the thumb ring sensor for O2 Vibe to capture and display heart rate and blood oxygen percent. The thumb ring sensor is connected to O2 Vibe via USB cable. That cable would get in the way of many activities. Also, there is a note in the Quick Start Guide saying, &ldquo;Please avoid excessive motion on the hand you&rsquo;re wearing the ring sensor.&rdquo; This device probably works well for walking or other light activity. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for intense workouts. Maybe if the ring sensor was wireless&hellip; If all you want to track is steps it will do that without the ring sensor. It isn&rsquo;t the most accurate as a pedometer since the device is on the wrist. It counts steps when I am reading a newspaper or using a computer.I will mention one more quirk with this device. The only time I can switch between sleep and activity mode is immediately after powering on the O2 Vibe. If the thumb ring isn&rsquo;t connected it will be in activity mode. If the thumb ring IS connected you can choose between sleep and activity mode, but the choice must be made right after the device is powered on.My SpO2 doesn&rsquo;t drop low enough to make the ring sensor vibrate, so I can&rsquo;t comment on that function. I hope in a future release they will enable a vibrate on low heart rate function.I hope this review helps others who are trying the BodiMetrics O2 Vibe.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-monitoring-my-apnea-once-i-figured-it-out">Great for monitoring my APNEA once I figured it out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After the email exchange below I am able to use the O2 Vibe to do exactly what I need. I have severe APNEA and I need to watch my SpO2 very carefully. With the O2 Vibe I can also check to test the various other CPAP masks and other products, and wake me if my Spo2 falls below a set threshold. The exercise mode lets me track my heartrate during exercise as well.&ndash;From: TomSent: Tuesday, April 25, 2017 11:33 AMTo: MarkSubject: O2 Vibe&ndash;From: MarkSent: Tuesday, April 25, 2017 1:17 PMTo: TomSubject: RE: O2 VibeThanks very much Tom for the detailed inquiry. I’ve done my best to provide answers and hope they solve your issues. Of course we are also always available by phone toll free (844) 744-8800, option 2. Or, worst case, we are happy to swap out O2 devices to you are completely satisfied.To your health,Mark[My questions are numbers and Mark&rsquo;s answers are bullets or capital letters]FYI, here are questions that I have about this product:1. I haven&rsquo;t been able to see the option to change the device mode between sleep and light exercise since the first day.• Please first turn off you O2 and remove the thumb sensor, Turn it back on• When the thumb sensor is removed the default mode is Fitness (two legs icon) so you cannot change to Sleep (Quarter Moon with Z’s) mode• Insert the thumb sensor and you can change between Fitness and Sleep2. At night the display shows the Bluetooth-to-iphone link in blue. Isn&rsquo;t it supposed to go dark after a while? (Is this due to the O2 being in the exercise mode? If so, see #1.)• If you leave your O2 mobile app open and connected 3 things are happening:A. You are not recording your sleep or fitnessB. You may be in Dashboard mode for fitness only andC. You are running your battery down and it will not last 24 hours.D. See your #1 above and be sure to close your app before going to bed. It is not necessary to have your app and device connected to record your sleep statistics or use the vibration functions.• Once you connect your O2 device to O2 mobile app the records will upload and you will be able to see and review in mobile app.3. I used the device during exercise but nothing was recorded. Or, if it was, I can&rsquo;t find it.• See above, if you are using the O2 device with the O2 mobile app in Dashboard mode you will need to do the following:A. Close the O2 mobile appB. Turn off your O2 device and to be safe remove the thumb sensorC. Turn your O2 device back on; open your O2 mobile app and select your device # to sync dataD. Your exercise record will upload• Your O2 device will store up to 4 records at a time without connecting to your mobile app4. I used the device last night during sleep, but nothing was recorded. Or, if it was, I can&rsquo;t find it.• Likely caused by the above situation that you were stuck in Fitness Mode; try following steps above, be sureA. Select the Sleep mode andB. Close your O2 mobile app• Your recording will upload upon reconnecting your device and mobile app the next morning.5. The battery doesn&rsquo;t last the entire night. (Could be that I have it in exercise mode. See #1.• You are correct see aboveRegarding the icons shown in the &ldquo;What O2 Vibe Screens Mean&rdquo; section of the quick start guide1. Screen does not show time remaining for the battery, only the % remaining bar.2. After a few seconds the device screen switches from the above view to the bluetooth connect view.3. I can&rsquo;t see any of the other icons shown in this section of the QS Guide on the device screen.• We have a revised O2 Vibe Quick Start Guide I will forward to you that may be clearerOther questions1. The guide has a table &ldquo;Operation Mode Navigation.&rdquo; The Screen Row in the Sleep Mode column says that the screen goes dark after 2 minutes but it&rsquo;s still recording. But the Bluetooth row says that the mode is on only when the screen lights up. I thought that the device had to be connected via bluetooth so that the app would sync data during the night.• You nailed it. You troubleshot the problem yourself:&ndash;Tom&mdash;&ndash;Mark,Thanks for the detailed feedback. I have one follow up question:Your O2 device will store up to 4 records at a time without connecting to your mobile appWhen I reconnect after a night’s sleep or an exercise session will I see the entire night and exercise session’s data? Or only 4 data points?Tom&ndash;Sorry Tom,I realize I wasn’t clear. Yes you will. The 4 records are complete recordings of your fitness session or sleep session so it isn’t data points but a whole night of sleep (one recording). Hopefully this helps address your question.Take care,Mark</p>
