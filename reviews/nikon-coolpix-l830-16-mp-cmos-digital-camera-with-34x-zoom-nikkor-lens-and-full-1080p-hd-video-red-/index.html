<h5 id="it-is-hard-to-not-recommend-it-having-worked-as-a-professional-photographer-for">it is hard to not recommend it. Having worked as a professional photographer for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used it much yet, but I can say that for $200, it is hard to not recommend it. Having worked as a professional photographer for several years, and having owned both pocket-sized and SLR-like digitals, I would say that the following are the important points to consider when making a camera purchase:1. Price (duh). If you don&rsquo;t want to spend $800 or more for a real camera (or at least something close to one), the next option is an SLR-like model (again - this one was only $200 - a big plus).2. SLR-Like vs. Pocket-Sized. To be honest, considering the capabilities of most phones nowadays, I don&rsquo;t undestand why they even still make pocket-sized cameras. (Although there are some that are sort of a cross between a pocket-sized &amp; SLR-like that have a lot of zoom and give you a bit of something to hold onto). (And personally, I consider having something to hold onto to be a big plus).3. Zoom. With 34x optical zoom, its a no-brainer. That&rsquo;s more zoom than you could get out of a 400mm lens with a doubler! (Try lugging one of those around). It also has image stabilization (a necessity for a long zoom shot).4. Pixels/Picture Quality. As some of you know, more pixels does not necessarily equate to a better picture. I have an old 5 meg Olympus which has a 7 meg interpolated mode which still takes as good or better pics than anything I have seen since. (But it is as slow as Christmas). As far as I know, the quality &amp; clarity is the pics from this camera are comparable to other 16 meg cameras on the market, but I would still keep it in the highest quality (least compressed/interpolated) mode.5. Auto Focus Speed. This is a BIG PLUS with this camera and a crucial factor which none of the mfgs. include in their specs. The primary reason that we wanted a new camera is because my wife and I were fed up with trying to take pictures of our little girl with a camera that would almost always never focus quickly enough to get the shot. If you read the specs regarding &ldquo;continuous shooting&rdquo; you will see that it will shoot ~6.7 fps (max ~5 frames) in Continuous High mode. That doesn&rsquo;t actually tell you how fast it will focus, but is the only means of comparison that most mfgs. provide. Also, one camera review/testing site rates the &ldquo;shutter lag&rdquo; when in autofocus at <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> to <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of a sec. I don&rsquo;t think there is anything else out there in the same price range that comes close.6. Batteries. It seemed odd that Nikon would have gone with AA&rsquo;s rather than the usual proprietary lithium, but I have decided that it might come in handy sometime to be able to just put in some new AA&rsquo;s rather than having to recharge. (And you can always use rechargeable AA&rsquo;s if you want).7. Focus Point. I discovered that you can go into the menu and select different focus points just like a real camera! (Despite having a face detection mode [which, if it is like other cameras, you will never use because it will increase the focus time], if you shoot a lot of portraits, it is a big plus to be able to quickly focus on the eyes/face &amp; then take the shot without having to bring the camera down). Unfortunately, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any way to tell the camera to keep the point that you selected. (You have to go into the menu &amp; reset it each time you turn the camera off).8. AWB (Auto White Balance). I had looked at a review which compared this camera to others in the same class, which included sample pics taken in different lighting conditions. I was thus very disappointed to discover that it pretty much sucks in getting the white balance right when shooting indoors. (A BIG MINUS, but probably not much worse than the competition).9. User Interface. The number &amp; placement of dedicated function buttons is pretty much the same as most digital cameras nowadays. However, they are placed so close to the edge (under the &ldquo;heel&rdquo; of your thumb when you hold the camera) that I keep inadvertently pressing one or more of them. Maybe in the next model they will put a bit of a lip or ridge there to help prevent that?10. Viewfinder/View Screen. The fact that the view screen can be extended &amp; rotated allows you to stand and look down at it (thus allowing you to get a lower camera angle). That is actually a big plus for those who are aware of such things and often find themselves shooting from a kneeling position. However, the absence of a viewfinder is a BIG MINUS in my opinion. If you read some of the other reviews, you will see that people complain about trying to use the screen in bright sunlight. You must in effect resort to shooting blindly and hoping that you manage to get a couple of good shots. That is true for most digital cameras, and unless you already have a thousand pics on your card, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if you take a hundred pics &amp; keep only one. Still, if Nikon had only included a viewfinder, they could have had a camera that without question would have been a real winner.- After receiving some specific questions, here is the link for the manual:<a href="http://download3.nikonimglib.com/archive1/B6sUJ00pkWTy0186hYa00PAl9y53/L830RM_%28En%2902.pdf">http://download3.nikonimglib.com/archive1/B6sUJ00pkWTy0186hYa00PAl9y53/L830RM_%28En%2902.pdf</a></p>

<h5 id="absolutely-one-of-the-best-point-shoot-i-have-used">ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST POINT &amp; SHOOT I HAVE USED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After over 50 years of Photographic experience and many Thousands of dollars spent on cameras, I thought I had seen it all. Most of the cameras that I own are in excess of $1000 dollars just for the body. The lens can cost twice that amount to make them work the way they can.My wife was going to Colorado for her Granddaughters wedding. Two years ago I had purchased her a FujiFilm camera that had been doing her a superb job of taking photos. I thought that she would be surprised if I got her a new camera for her trip. I had a limited amount of funds so I done some extensive research and came across this Nikon Coolpix L830. I spoke with a fellow professional photographer that had purchased one of these for his wife. He had nothing but good things to say about the camera. So I purchased one of these for her trip. When she returned, we sat down and viewed her photos on our office 36 inch HDTV I was blown away by the quality of the photos. Under the most terrible conditions the camera had produced amazing photos. Low light conditions were not a problem for this camera. Zoom it to the full extent of the lens and the photos were amazing. Clear sharp focus and color spot on. I was so amazed that I purchased me one to have as a &ldquo;take everywhere camera&rdquo;. It is never out of my camera bag and is my grab &amp; shoot camera. I can recommend this little camera to anyone wanting a quality camera at a reasonable price. Has it replaced my $3000 dollar Sony DSLR? Actually yes, I grab this when I want a quick high quality photo without a lot of hassle. Fantastic little point and shoot camera. You have got to get one of these little cameras for sure.</p>

<p>Expected to receive this camera on the 8th of December, but it arrived on the 2nd, a day after I ordered it. I am not sure the same will apply if you purchase it, but in regards to the speed I am highly surprised.***<strong><em>Although it may be lengthy, please read for an honest review.</em></strong>***<strong><em>IN REGARDS TO THE CAMERA:I spent HOURS reading the reviews and had mixed feelings. I even researched outside sources to come to a conclusion. Bottom line, I decided to purchase the camera which seemed to be on sale for a great deal.I purchased this camera as stated &ldquo;New&rdquo; from amazon, and the seller I believe had a name that began with an S. I clicked on the sellers name highlighted in blue and saw a 98% satisfaction rating with VERY LITTLE dissatisfaction. Seemed good enough to me.Although unexpected, I received the camera with ALL of the wires (really came with one connection cable; USB), a set of batteries, and straps which I looked up how to attach on youtube.First and foremost,Any and all issues I found from reading the review were mainly handled in the manual which I found online prior to getting it in the mail along with the package. Papers on a one year warranty were also included.Although the manual was long, I am VERY HAPPY I took the time to read it because it offered some great information that those who rated the product four stars or less complained about.I AM NOT a photographer, but let me tell you this is an AMAZING CAMERA. The view when uploaded to my computer was crystal clear, and the editing options on the camera were great. I could go into greater detail about all of the specs, but you are better off looking up a youtube video to learn about the camera and watch some comparisons. -Thats what I did and found this camera to be great for me.I do not happen to care that the camera takes AA batteries, but that seemed to be a deal-breaker for some. As long as the batteries do not void the warranty, looking into rechargeable batteries may be for you. In addition, you do not have to worry about forgetting the charger.Secondly, you may want to purchase a case for the camera. I did not think about this and will dig through my closet for something sturdy enough to do the trick until I buy one. Also, you need a SD card (or memory card).YES, the auto focus can be blurry at times and a steady hand takes a better photo, but with a little patience, and I MEAN A LITTLE, everything should clear out. It is nothing out of the ordinary and the same thing happened with my first camera (which is still nothing in comparison). Reading the manual will also help to explore your AF (autofocus) options. Another issue I found in the reviews was that the camera did not have a viewfinder (something you can look into)&hellip; but the screen tilts. I must agree a viewfinder would have made it nicer, but it wasn&rsquo;t a deal breaker. I can just as well hold the camera away from my face and snap the shot.Spend the time to get to know the camera, and you will love it&hellip;I have never owned an expensive cannon camera (but wanted it) and now realize that may have been a little out of my league. People have called this camera a &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; but I love it.I could go on, but altogether I am very pleased with the purchase and I have reason to believe you will be too. Take some of the negative reviews with a grain of salt because they probably did not read the manual, but listen to the &ldquo;pitfalls&rdquo; as some have described them to see if the camera is right for you.It does not feel cheap, not very heavy and the color (red) I purchased is sexy to say the least; its a dark red, whereas, it looks slightly pink in the picture.I agree, it will take some time to get to know how to use it like I want to, but from just messing around with it, I love it.The smile finder also works great! (you may want to buy a tripod if you plan on using this often) So far I have had multiple blurry pictures using it but I THINK that&rsquo;s because I am still learning. Ill re-read the manual :)GREAT CAMERAINCLUDED:</em></strong>*USB CORD**<strong><em>NECK AND LENS STRAPS</em></strong>*<strong><em>FOUR AAA BATTERIES</em></strong>*<strong><em>SLIP FOR A 1 YEAR WARRANTYMANY NEED TO PURCHASE:~MEMORY CARD~ADDITIONAL AA BATTERIES~TRIPOD ( MUST BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL)~CAMERA CARRYING CASE</em></strong><strong><em>UPDATE &mdash;&ndash;&gt; SEE THE ATTACHED PICTURES (I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER)</em></strong>*******I STILL LOVE THE CAMERA A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, BUT MY MAIN SUGGESTION IS: PURCHASE NIKON WARRANTY APPROVED RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES: FLASH ADDS TO THE PERFECTION OF THE PICTURE BUT IT ALSO DRAINS THE BATTERY.YOU CAN FIND OUT IF THEY ARE WARRANTY APPROVED BY CHECKING THE MANUAL YOU RECEIVE WITH THE PACKAGE, CALLING THEM AND/OR LOOKING IT UP ONLINE.PS. IT CAN TAKE A FEW BLURRY PICTURES UNTIL YOU GET THE HANG OF THE CAMERA BUT IF YOU LEARN HOW TO USE IT YOU CAN REALLY GET A GREAT SHOT!I HOPE THIS HELPED!</p>
