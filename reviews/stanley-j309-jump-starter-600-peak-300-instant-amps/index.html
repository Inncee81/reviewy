<p>Size:600 Peak Amp
The Stanley 300-amp jump starter delivers three hundred amperes of current to a twelve-volt battery for instant startup of your vehicle. The Stanley jump starter works on desulfation technology to provide an instant start. The built-in charger enables you to charge the battery anytime and anywhere on the go. This convenient portable jump starter works equally well for motorbikes, especially in extreme winter conditions and prevents any choking of the battery. The Stanley 300-amp jump starter is small, easy to carry and lighter than many other battery-equipped units. The complete jump starter comes with a heavy-duty metal clamp in an impact-resistant, injection-molded case. (extension cord NOT included)</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="didn-t-work-the-first-time-i-needed-to-use-it">Didn&rsquo;t work the first time I needed to use it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charged it up, all ready to go in case of emergency but sadly it didn&rsquo;t work the first time I needed to use it. Not only could I not crank the engine but on troubleshooting there is no voltage/amps using a multimeter across the clamps even though the little worklight could turn on. Called tech support and went through troubleshooting - unit will not hold a charge. Bought in Jan and now it&rsquo;s April so I can&rsquo;t return it through Amazon and the warranty states that the customer has to pay return shipping for warranty service. Basically it&rsquo;s now a very large, very expensive flashlight. If you buy it, test it out before the amazon return period ends. I thought it was charged up because I clicked the battery button and all the battery lights flashed on. According to tech support, you have to hold the battery button down for 10 seconds. If the lights are not still lit at 10 seconds then the unit is not charged. This is not mentioned in the manual at all.</p>

<h5 id="after-2-short-uses-the-compressor-feature-stopped-working">After 2 short uses, the compressor feature stopped working &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 2 short uses, the compressor feature stopped working. We contacted Stanley and were told that although it is under warranty, we have to pay to have this shipped to them, and they will replace it. It is ridiculous that they will not stand behind their product. We are now trying to work with Amazon to see if we can return it to Amazon at no cost to us.</p>

<h5 id="check-that-this-is-right-for-you-before-buying">Check that this is right for you before buying</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to perform as advertised. But as stated in the manual, this will need to be recharged about every month or so or else the battery will go empty and get ruined. You should also note that this does not support trickle charging, so you will need to unplug it when it&rsquo;s done charging to avoid overcharging. This is kind of a hassle, but not that big of a deal. On the other hand, other brands seem to provide trickle charging support. I should also mention that the cables could be longer. These are something like 3-4&rsquo; long.A lot of the negative reviews seem to indicate that this failed to successfully jump a car. Depending on your car, the amps needed to turn the starter over may vary. This should have no problem starting a car with just a low battery or smaller engines (say 4 cylinders), but if the battery is dead or the health of the battery is a problem, then you may fail to start your car.To see if this has enough amps, check on any auto parts store website to see the amp rating for replacement batteries for your vehicle. As an example, let&rsquo;s compare a I4 and V6 2007 Honda Accord. I&rsquo;m using O&rsquo;Reilly Auto for battery comparisons.I4: Cranking Amps range from 555 - 615. This jump starter should have no problems.V6: Cranking Amps range from 665 - 910. It is unlikely that this jump starter can start the car on a dead/dying battery.If you want to play it safe, make sure there&rsquo;s a safety margin between what the jump starter promises and what your battery is rated for. While it might seem somewhat expensive to step up to a higher rated jump starter (say 1000 or 1700 amps), you&rsquo;ll easily make back the difference the first time your car dies and no one is around to help.</p>

<h5 id="good-peace-of-mind-for-the-forgetful">Good peace of mind for the forgetful.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can only give half of a review because I haven&rsquo;t had to use it, thank goodness. I got a new, old, car that had lights that were no long automatic. Having had an automatic car before, I kept forgetting to turn the lights off and drained my battery more times then I want to admit to. After being stranded at the vet I decided something needed to be done. I purchased this one because of all the extra things it does. It arrived on time and well packaged, I went out, got a cord to use to charge it from home, charged it up and put it in my trunk. Then I finally got used to my car and haven&rsquo;t forgotten my lights since. It&rsquo;s nice to know that if I forget I have a backup, or even if I find a soft tire that I&rsquo;m covered as well. It gives me peace of mind. If I do end up using it I&rsquo;ll tell ya how it goes.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-good-but-some-issues">Pretty good but some issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The unit seems good and I used it to fill up 2 wheelbarrow wheels to 30 psi which went quickly. I have several issues though. The first is the air filler. Most fillers have a end where you put on the connector and then flip a clamp to tighten it. This has a straight threaded end. You need to tighten it up by screwing it in then fire up the pump. You lose a little air on the unscrew. Getting it on can be a bit of a pain especially if the stems are not tilted out. I needed to bend the hose to get it started on the wheelbarrow wheels and getting the screw started while you are bending can be a challenge. Also the hose is a bit short (24&rdquo; from the base of the unit to full extension). If you have a big wheel and the stem is at the top you may need to hold the unit up both to get it screwed on and while it is pumping. Getting it screwed on is really a two hand operation so unless someone is with you you may run out of hands. The documentation is a bit confusing. It said that it came partially charged and you need to charge it for 40 hours the first time. Also it said to charge until 2 red and one green light are lit or flashing. Which is it lit or flashing? Does each mean something different? This may just be because they are using the same doc for multiple units so it is generic. Does 2 black mean low but usable? There is no reference other than all 3 lit. Also they don&rsquo;t say whether it is supposed to be ON or OFF for charging. I did it OFF. It came out of the box with all lights lit (not flashing). I turned it on and checked it with a meter and it was at 15 volts. I suspect that they bulk charged the batteries before putting in he unit. I hope the 15 volts doesn&rsquo;t do damage. After filling the wheelbarrow tires the lights that were lit went out and it was down to 12.75 volts. If I pressed the status button all lights went on. I charged it for several 10 hour sessions and the voltage was always 12.86 volts. Evidently this is full charge and there is an overcharge safety. The doc says that the unit cannot be overcharged following their directions. However, the 3 lights never came on where the directions say to charge until they come on without using the status button. Using the status button all 3 lights came on. The only time all 3 lights were lit without pressing the status button was out of the box when it was at 15 volts. Bottom line: (1) It looks like you can&rsquo;t overcharge (2) 12.86 volts is max charge (3) All 3 lights will not light without status button (4) Mine came VERY fully charged. (5) Air hose pretty funkyIf anyone has different behavior and all three lights come on without a status check and/or a full charge is more that 12.86 volts I would like to know so I can return it. Note: you need to turn it On to check the voltage.</p>
