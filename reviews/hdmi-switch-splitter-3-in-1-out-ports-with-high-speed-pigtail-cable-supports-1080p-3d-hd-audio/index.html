<p>Color: HDMI Switch Powered from Connected Devices No power adapter is necessary to make this switch work, as long as the connected devices supply sufficient power. HDMI cables have the capability to deliver power from connected sources HDMI Supported Features Up to 1080p, HDCP 1.0/1.1, 12-bit Deep Color, 3D, and uncompressed/compressed audio formats are some of the newer HDMI features supported on this switch. Gold-Plated Connector,the 24K gold-plated connector on the 20in / 50cm cable resists corrosion and reduces tarnish. Features and Specifications ❖ 3 HDMI inputs / 1 HDMI output ❖ Supports 12-bit Deep color per channel; maximum of 36-bits across all channels ❖ Supports 3D devices ❖ Maximum Single Link Video Range: 1920x1080p ❖ Supports Automatically detect and choose ❖ Supports 2.5Gbps/250MHz per channel, maximum bandwidth per display is 7.5Gbps ❖ Supports uncompressed audio such as LPCM ❖ Supports compressed audio such as DTS Digital, Dolby Digital, DTS-HS and Dolby TrueHD ❖ 24k gold-plated connector ❖ Operating Temperature: 0°C to +70°C ❖ Operating Humidity: 10% to 85 % RH ❖ External Power Supply: No power needed NOTE Plug-and-forget auto sensing only works correctly for devices that do not output continuous voltage over the HDMI port when turned off. Powering on a device gives it output priority over the other two devices. Output priority is given to the next device on the switch if the current output device is turned off. Make sure the connected devices supply enough power to the switch. Devices that require HDCP 2.2 or higher may be incompatible (e.g. Roku 4). Package includes: 3X1 PORT 1080P HDMI SWITCH USER MANUAL</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked this HDMI splitter so much that I actually bought a second one and gave it as a gift. A great way to expand your HDMI ports on an older TV so that you can use a Fire Stick or Chormecast or HULU or any thing that you may need to plug into. It works great and I highly recommend this unit for anyone who needs to add HDMI ports.Whats convenient about this product is that it saves hastles switching cables and usbs, especially for the trends of everyone going for HD, This HDMI does the exact, combined my TV and PS4 so I can enjoy the gaming experience much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-today-s-tv">A Must-Have for Today&rsquo;s TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 3-to-1 multiplex HDMI adapter is a must-have if you are facing the same problem as I do: too many HDMI devices. Virtually all screen casting devices nowadays have HDMI port as the default way of directing the display to the large screen TV: game console, bluray, chromecast, fire stick, and the list goes on and on.My TV has 4 HDMI inputs, all of them are taken. This adapter just added 2 more valuable HDMI ports to the TV, so I don&rsquo;t have to keep plug and unplug different devices and risk damaging the TV&rsquo;s HDMI ports. And if I need more, I can buy another.It&rsquo;s no brainer to figure out how to use it. You plug up to 3 HDMI devices to the adapter as inputs, and connect the other end to an TV HDMI port as output. The adapter has a little &ldquo;select&rdquo; button which switch to the next HDMI input in order, and loops back from the 3rd input to the 1st one.It also has an &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; mode, where if you turn on or plug in a new device, it switch to it automatically. Or if you turn off or unplug a device, it switch to the next active one. However, if your device is not truly powered off, just standby instead, it will not do this &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; switch. I guess it does this by detecting the current from all the inputs.The user manual can certainly be enhanced to address some typo and grammar issues. If you don&rsquo;t have enough HDMI ports on your TV, this is what you need buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended">Recommended!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a perfect solution! You always have too many Hdmi cords and never enough slots to plug them in. It comes with instructions but you really don&rsquo;t need them, so easy to use. For the price this is a great quality product. We just plugged it into the TV and instantly have three from one to three Hdmi plugins. I would say everyone needs this! I highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="will-def-recommended-it-to-anybody-looking-for-a-solution-when-your">Will def recommended it to anybody looking for a solution when your &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Simple plug and play switch is exactly as the picture showing and described on the product page. It does exactly what it says and as simple as that. No overbearing switch or functionality and perform well for it&rsquo;s simplicity. I&rsquo;ve plug the switch with my PS4 Chrome case and an external HDMI cable for my laptop. It works very well switching betting all three device and exactly what i &rsquo;m looking for. Will def recommended it to anybody looking for a solution when your TV does not come with enough HDMI port!</p>

<h5 id="plug-it-in-and-that-s-all-hdmi-splitter">Plug it in and that&rsquo;s all hdmi splitter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really puzzled what to do when my wife wanted to hook up another hdmi connector to the TV. My TV has 2 ports only. I have used both and needed more.This adaptor gave me three more ports. No battery required. Literally just plug it in. There is a channel changer button to the top and you can change between devices. I have 2 smart tv boxes. See my pictures. 1 for kids and the other strictly for adults. Easy change with a press of the button.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-perfect-idea-if-you-have-an-older-tv-or-bought">Absolutely perfect idea if you have an older tv or bought &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical of the HDMI splitter and assumed it would lessen the sound or picture quality. I haven&rsquo;t had any problems hooking multiple devices up using this. Absolutely perfect idea if you have an older tv or bought one of those Black Friday deals with only 2 HDMI ports. Gives a ton more flexibility with your existing tvs without spending hundreds to buy a new one because you need more ports. Awesome product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-very-good-buy-low-price">A very good buy. Low price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very good buy. Low price. It does what it needs to do. We bought this HDMI cord because we have a lot of game systems and a cable box that require to be hooked up via HDMI. . People who wanna use one monitor for multi devices, definitely check this out. This 3 in 1 HDMI switch makes my life much easier. Now, I can connect with up to 3 HDMI port for my LED TV..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works">works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well.If there is only one HDMI port on your TV or monitor, and you have a PS4, a Roku, and a Fire TV like me this is the solution.It provides three port for three &ldquo;input&rdquo; source to the TV/ Monitor. And it would auto detect the ones that is live and on.This is NOT something that connect your computer to two or three monitor. ( Trust me, I wanted to buy something like that as well)</p>
