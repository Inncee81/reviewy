<h5 id="2016-best-rated-love-it">2016 best rated. Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>2016 best rated. Love it. Better off with this Lithium battery version, as my last electric tooth brush used Nimi batteries and it only lasted a year.TIP, Dont recharge every day. Batteries have what is called cycles and can only be recharged a number of times. This Philips brush has a battery level indicator. When I use twice a day the battery lasts about 2 weeks, which means I only need to charge about 2 times month which will make your Electric Brush battery last 4+ times longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exceptional-product-has-problems-with-durability">Exceptional product, has problems with durability</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>5 stars for the job that is is doing - my last toothbrush was oral B, and Sonicare is a huge improvement. I started to love brushing my teeth, and feeling very clean. As other reviewers mentioned, after I while I only use the standard cleaning, so the other options are not very useful. I guess it&rsquo;s good to still have the option.The reason I gave it 4 starts though is because it is not durable. A few months ago, it started to work on and off. It would work a bit, then not for a bit, then start again and so on. Suddenly, brushing teeth was not so easy, and became more time consuming and frustrating. I came here to share my experience in a review, when I read in another review that the warranty period for this toothbrush is two years. Thanks to Amazon, I knew the exact date I bought it, I registered the product with Philips, and after a short chat, a replacement is on the way.I thought I&rsquo;d share this experience as well - Philips stands behind its product, and it is very easy to get the product replaced is if malfunctions while it is under warranty.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="phillips-sonicare-vs-oral-b">Phillips Sonicare Vs. Oral B</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously used the Phillips Sonicare then tried the Oral B for a period of time. The Oral B didn&rsquo;t perform as well, performance of the Oral B decreased fairly quickly (brush head quit rotating with the slightest bit of pressure) after a year or so. Based upon past experience, the Phillips Sonicare is a much better device, and vs. the Oral B maintains its performance for an extended period of time. Hence, I went back to using the Philips Sonicare and highly recommend it over the Oral B.</p>

<h5 id="a-very-good-toothbrush-but-most-of-the-fancy-features-are-unnecessary-for-the-majority-of-people-go-with-the-easy-clean-model">A very good toothbrush, but most of the fancy features are unnecessary for the majority of people. Go with the Easy Clean model.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My dentist had recommended Sonicare to me, and told me that any model that comes with their Quadpacer timer would be fine. You basically divide your mouth into four sections, and the brush will notify you every 30 seconds so that you can switch to brushing a different section. It seems kind of silly and trivial, but it really has gotten me to brush more consistently. I always brush for the full two minutes now, and each corner of my mouth gets a full 30 seconds.I&rsquo;ve been using the less expensive Sonicare Easy Clean model for about 6 months now, and I jumped at the chance to upgrade to the Flexcare Plus. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve been pretty disappointed with the extra features that comes with the Flexcare.The travel case is NOT the same as the USB charging case, in case [sic] anyone is wondering. It&rsquo;s just a plain, plastic, clam shell case that will hold the toothbrush and the two brush heads. The Flexcare Plus and my old Easy Clean actually have the same charging base, but now it&rsquo;s called the travel charger. The Flexcare Plus also comes with a wider, plastic, snap-on base that you clip around the travel charger to give it a wider footprint along with two holders for extra brush heads.The Flexcare not only has the regular brushing mode with Quadpacer, but it also offers modes for gum care, refresh, sensitive, and massage. They basically offer different vibration settings and cleaning patterns. If you have incredibly sensitive teeth and gums, then you might find some value in buying a Sonicare model that offers different intensity settings, but I feel like the regular cleaning mode on these brushes is gentle enough for most people. I tend to get sensitive spots on my teeth and gums, and I&rsquo;ve never had any issues with my Easy Clean model being too strong.Overall, the Flexcare Plus is still a great toothbrush, but I feel like the extra features are going to go unused for most people. If you travel a lot, you really should splurge for the high-end model that comes with the USB charger. Otherwise, I think the basic Easy Clean model is definitely the best bang for your buck.</p>

<h5 id="my-dentist-recommended">My Dentist Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to buy an electric toothbrush for a while. In a recent cleaning appt my dentist asked if I had bought one yet, and I admitted to her that I was shopping for one but was feeling overwhelmed by all the options. I like having all the bells and whistles and there was always a newer improved option like UV disinfecting light, or travel cases with charger, etc. She recommended this one and explained the other items were not really necessary. I love it. My mouth feels as clean as right after a cleaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality-control">Poor quality control</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased two of these from different retailers, both were dead on arrival. Would not power-on, would not charge.The first came from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and when I returned it the store admitted that most of the newer models come back with various defects. They didn&rsquo;t have another one in stock, so I purchased one from Amazon and it had the same problem.This is a newer version of an older product that was great. I ultimately found the older version still available on Amazon, which was much less expensive and actually works.</p>

<p>10 months after buying this, it is rattling so loud that I almost can&rsquo;t use it. Sometimes it even cuts out. My last one lasted several years. Not sure what to do.</p>
