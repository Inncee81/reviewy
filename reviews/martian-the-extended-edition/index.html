<h5 id="extended-edition-blu-ray">Extended Edition Blu-ray</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the EXTENDED EDITION Blu-ray. The five stars relate to the movie itself and the quality of this Blu-ray edition.I had purchased the original Blu-ray when it was released. I doubt I would have purchased this again for only ten additional minutes of content except for the Amazon credit I needed to burn. Of course this is a no brainer if you are upgrading to Blu-ray or haven&rsquo;t purchased yet. I was unable to find an explanation online as to the actual extra scene content, so I have provided a synopsis here.Spoilers Follow:Most of the additional screen time relates to Mark Watney on the planet. Otherwise, there is a scene between Vincent and Annie after his press conference where she is unhappy with his performance. There is also a scene where the NASA group are discussing what Mark wrote in response to finding out they hadn&rsquo;t told the crew he was alive. This was supposedly changed for the movie to get the PG-13 theatrical rating. There is also a little more of Rich Purnell.On Mars there are a number of scenes which just have a few seconds added on. This also relates to showing the lag in downtime with both Mark and NASA waiting for responses. There is a scene showing Commander Lewis letting Mark know they were coming for him. A couple of scenes where Mark decides to finish the work and experiments the crew were doing, and him doing that. A little additional time in the rover, and a section showing how he lived during the time it took him to get to the rocket.There is four minutes of deleted scenes on disk two.*Mark calculates rover time distances*Hermes crew discuss sleeping arrangements*Mark looks at Earth from Hermes with final VOA good movie and an excellent looking picture. One of the few lately where the CGI doesn&rsquo;t look overdone.</p>

<h5 id="the-martian-extended-edition-outstanding-feature-film-and-new-bonus-features-make-this-worthwhile">&ldquo;The Martian Extended Edition:&rdquo; outstanding feature film and new bonus features make this worthwhile.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Film director Ridley Scott is well known for releasing direct-to-disc “Extended Editions” or “Director’s Cuts” of selected movies, usually several months after the completion of their theatrical runs. His most notable Director’s Cuts, which are usually vastly superior to their shorter theatrical releases, include “Kingdom of Heaven,” “American Gangster,” “Gladiator,” and now “The Martian.”I’ve already reviewed the theatrical release version on Blu-ray disc (BD) of “The Martian” here at Amazon. I think it’s a nearly perfect blend of drama, high adventure, suspense, comedy, and realistically futuristic technology. Starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean, and based on Andy Weir’s novel of the same name, it tells the story of how an American astronaut, presumed killed in a violent sandstorm on Mars, is left behind to fight for his survival against incredibly long odds…“The Martian Extended Edition” is a 2-BD set, with one disc containing both the theatrical release and extended edition of Scott’s feature film, and the other containing a wide variety of excellent special features – most of which are brand new. The extended edition is 151 minutes long and adds about 10 minutes of footage to the theatrical release. Most of the extra footage shows astronaut Mark Watney’s heroic efforts to survive on Mars long enough for someone to come and rescue him. A few minutes are added to various scenes back on earth at Mission Control.I didn’t see any significant differences between the extended and theatrical versions of the film, so I’m a bit undecided as to whether or not my purchase of “The Martian Extended Edition” was worth the extra money I paid for it. However, if there were anything that does make my purchase worthwhile, it would have to be that supplemental “Special Features” disc included in this 2-BD set. I thought the bonus features were all very entertaining, interesting, and helpful in enhancing my enjoyment of the feature film. Highly recommended for both the feature film and the outstanding bonus features.</p>

<h5 id="satisfies-adventure-drama-sci-fi-and-nasa-fans-extended-cut-only-make-it-better">Satisfies adventure-drama, sci-fi and NASA fans! Extended cut only make it better!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a sci-fi and NASA fan, and a huge fan of the book, I love this movie! Ridley Scott did a fantastic job of keeping this story adventurous and entertaining for the non-sci-fi crowd as well. Plenty of other movie reviews are available so I&rsquo;ll stop my commentary there.The Extended cut is very much worth it. Even if one doesn&rsquo;t go through every minute of the film to find the extra bits of scenes that add up to the bonus ten minutes, the other extras are well worth it. For the purists, a few hours of NASA panels are included to discuss actual missions to Mars. For the story fans, there are some great &ldquo;media extras&rdquo; set inside the time frame of the movie. Also included are lots of takes of the making-of the movie.</p>
