<h5 id="ep-ng930">EP-NG930</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After doing a lot of research and reading about the amount of faked Samsung chargers, I specifically ordered one directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller. Not that Amazon itself wouldn&rsquo;t have already sold products by mistake as well (such as phone batteries according to the German magazine c&rsquo;t) but I guess the chances in getting a genuine product are way higher with Amazon in this case. This degress is necessary as I think most people who rate the Samsung charger not that great, most probably got nailed and received a fake.The original, at least the one for the US market, comes with a fast charger (typ A socket, but accepting voltages from 100 to 240) and a micro USB &lt;-&gt; USB type A cable and weighs 167g according to Samsung&rsquo;s description on their website. Most fakes I&rsquo;ve read about are told to be more lightweight and also lack the built-in fan.When it comes to functionality, the charger works for me just as I expected: depending on the phone&rsquo;s setting (using it with a Samsung Galaxy S7 G930FD), while fast charging, the integrated fan of the charger be barely hearable whereas in the slower charging mode, one can only hear a slight ticking sound, but both only when really getting close. Furthermore, when having reached 100% charge level, the charger&rsquo;s normally blue LED becomes green, signalling the &ldquo;charge hold&rdquo; status. Opposed to cheaper and fake chargers, the phone thus isn&rsquo;t recharged again and again but simply stays at 100% then, even when used simultanously, so effectively it&rsquo;s just as if hooked up to the cable directly minus the wear of USB port by plugging it every day.The price Samsung calls for, isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap and if you can relinquish the fast charge functionality, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that other cheaper options will get the job done equally good at least over night, but if you want to make use of the fully phone&rsquo;s charging capabilities, this one directly from Amazon saves a lot of hassle and is my recommended way to go.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought two of these to go on my wife and mine night stands. Now our room is like a runway with LED lights bright enough to land a small plane. Not all that bad though, because they do charge our S7 Edge phones pretty fast and when we get bored we can do shadow puppets on our walls.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-high-quality-fast-charging-pad">Very nice high quality Fast charging pad.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First I want to let you know I have both the regular charging pad and this Fast charging pad. They both work fine, but this one really charges up your phone fast. It lights up different colors to mean different things. Easy to use charging pad. I purchased the normal charging pad first before knowing there was a fast charger model. So I use the normal charging pad in on the night stand for night charging. If I need my phone charged up Fast I use this Fast charging pad in the kitchen. I get home from work and drop it on the fast charger. Later use the phone around the house, then when I go to get I place it on the normal charging pad. If I only had money for one, get this Fast charging pad. Hope this helps you decide.</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-money">WORTH THE MONEY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are thinking the price is too high, let me tell you&hellip;I returned another highly rated product at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>+ the cost that I purchased before this one. Let me tell you why this is worth the money: 1. It is rapid charging, 2. It comes with the BLACK brick (rapid charging and black cord) so you don&rsquo;t have to buy one or use the one that came with your phone, 3 the back of your phone stays cool&ndash;the lesser expensive one got my phone really hot, 4. It is adjustable. It can be upright or down and I personally like to see my phone and grab to answer calls, 5. It is amazingly beautiful with leather pad look, 6. it is very stable, with a grip pad to keep it from sliding and sturdy enough to securely hold my Galaxy S8 phone &ndash;an $800 investment. I liked it so much I&rsquo;m giving my son one just like it. There&rsquo;s not a better option . You will like it for certain if you can get over the price. It&rsquo;s worth it.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-stand-compact-and-unobtrusive">Great stand - compact and unobtrusive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: Compact design, good rubber-like backing keeps the phone from sliding off, charges my phone quickly, comes with cord and quick-charge plug (some competing products require those be purchased separately, so factor in that cost if comparing).Cons: LED on the base is extremely bright, cord and plug I received were a different color than the stand.Setup was easy; the unit ships as a single piece, so no assembly needed to attach the base as I&rsquo;ve seen in some upright stands. The device I received has a black body, but came with a white cord and plug - this isn&rsquo;t a big deal to me as the cord is out of sight where I have it placed; but if anyone is particularly OCD about wanting these to match, it&rsquo;s something to be aware. I was concerned when I read in the documentation that there is a small fan in the device to keep the coils from overheating, as I was placing the stand next to my bed; however, the fan is completely silent - I had to place my ear against the unit to hear it, and even then I had to strain to pick it up. There is an LED on the front middle of the base which lights up blue when the unit is charging a phone; that LED is extremely bright and I found bothersome while trying to fall asleep; for now, I have something small sitting in front of it which blocks the LED light - although I&rsquo;ll probably use some LightDims or similar to dim it longer-term.Overall, I&rsquo;m impressed. Very convenient, I like being able to just sit my phone down on it to charge or pick it up quickly without needing to plug/unplug. The unit is smaller than I thought from the photos online, which is nice as it doesn&rsquo;t take up much space on the night-stand.Disclaimer: I did not receive my charger from Amazon, instead receiving it as a bundled promotional item (in retail packaging) from my carrier when purchasing my S7 Edge.UPDATE 3/21/2016: I am able to notice the faint hum from the fan more easily now. Not sure if it&rsquo;s actually louder, or if I&rsquo;m just becoming more sensitive to noticing it. The sound is still quite faint, and is not bothersome.READ MORE</p>
