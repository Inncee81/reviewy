<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="simple-and-easy-to-install">Simple and Easy to Install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount is extremely strong and able to support my new Samsung 55&rdquo; flat screen. I was able to screw the mount into two wall studs top and bottom, ensuring this is mounted to the wall safely and w/o any concern of it coming loose. The tilt option and the quick release pull downs are easy to use. The quick release is a great safety assurance that no one is able to accidently lift the bottom of the TV away from the wall. But should you need to do so, each release is quickly accessed by hand and because the TV is a 55&rdquo; unit, it hides the release pull down ribbons very well. You&rsquo;ll want to use a &ldquo;real&rdquo; level and not the 1&rdquo; bubble level that comes with the wall mount.Installing it was very easy, all (and more) of the screws, washers, connectors came in the package, so no need to have to run out to the hardware store due to missing parts. Instructions were written very well and easy to follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-economical-tv-mount">Good quality, economical TV mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this to mount a Ultra-Slim Samsung 55&rdquo; LED TV above a fireplace so I wanted some tilt while maintaining a low profile. TV mounted easily and even with just under 10 degree tilt I had no issues with connections and cables behind the TV.One of the arms that mounts to the TV did not want to latch onto the frame even when pulling down the release cord. I could get it to catch without the TV mounted, but once the TV was mounted I was no longer able to place pressure in the right location to get the catch far enough over the frame to mount. Does not affect appearance and as one of the two are latched and I don&rsquo;t live in an earth quake area and too high for kids to reach it works fine, but why removed 1 star.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="there-are-better-mounts-out-there-but-these-are-very-good-at-this-price">There are better mounts out there but these are very good at this price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although I prefer one piece mounts to one&rsquo;s that have to be assembled such as these, these worked great to mount 3 flat panel TVs in my new home. Leveling them can be a bit of a chore due to the center connector of the 2 piece mount giving such a short span to reference. You have to be careful when assembling the 2 piece wall bracket to ensure the center support and each side piece are in the same &ldquo;plane&rdquo; when referenced from the top. Once that is done though the rest of install is a breeze. I also recommend if only one stud is being used to secure it in other holes using better dry wall anchors than the ones supplied. I got lucky on 2 of the 3 mounts and was able to get it secured to 2 studs. On the third I used large toggle style drywall anchors that engage a large area on the back of the drywall. All in all I am happy with the mounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-sturdy">Very sturdy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and it was easy to get the TV mounted on it. I did use 4 snap togglers that were rated for 200 lbs ( I went a little overboard) each to mount it to the wall. My new 43&rdquo; LG 4K TV weighs about 19 lbs. and is very thin and I am confident that it will we be on the wall till I take it down. Mounting dream does not recommend this and you should know what you anchors are rated for and the weight of your TV to make your decision. But I did not have the studs where I needed them to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-heavy-duty-value-wall-mount">Excellent heavy duty value wall mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality wall mount. Was very easy to set up, especially with a level included. Instructions are clear and easy to understand. Mounted our 40&rdquo; LG on our wall. We have non standard 19&rdquo; wall studs so this was a perfect kit. Very heavy duty. Loved that it comes with a braided HDMI cable and a flush adapter, other kits don&rsquo;t include them and so that would of been an additional cost. Excellent value priced mount compared to others, would highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="went-up-very-easily-came-with-a-variety-of-mounting-hardware-and">went up very easily, came with a variety of mounting hardware and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding! I ordered this CHEAP TV mount because I had no choice but to get a cheap one. Well boy did I hit the lotto. This is very well made, went up very easily, came with a variety of mounting hardware and a variety of hardware to attach to TVs. On top of that, it came with a level and an HDMI cable. Really? At this price? Yes! I know I&rsquo;m gushing, which I don&rsquo;t normally do in reviews, but I was very impressed with the product for the price. A very rare (for me) five stars!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-installation">Simple Installation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy installation I must say. Mounted a 47 inch Samsung with ease. The most time consuming part was locating the wall studs. I much prefer a magnetic stud finder over an electronic. The electronic stud finder, mine at least, wasn&rsquo;t accurate (edge-to-edge). The magnetic stud finder, which you can find for around $10 at HD or Lowes, was incredibly accurate.Socket wrench for the lag bolts also made things easier. Only recommendation: make the HDMI cable solid black. The blue coloring makes the cable less inconspicuous. We plan on mounting another TV in the future and I&rsquo;ll be purchasing again for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-look-and-easy-to-install">Nice look and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used two of these, one on an older 44 inch TV and another on a new 70 inch. I really like how tight they mount to the wall, almost impossible to see any of the cables behind the TV. Installation was easy on the 44 inch but the kit didn&rsquo;t have the correct mounting bolts for the Samsung 70 inch. I was able to make due with a dremel tool and some different bolts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-design-does-the-job">Sturdy design, does the job.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had reservations as when I received the mount since I had never used a three piece plate system like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my 65 inch plasma flat screen!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value and easy set up</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-great-mounts-great-price">These are great mounts, great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great mounts , great price , I thought they would be lesser quality because of the price , I bought four more for my other tvs and hope they are around when I need more&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wrong-bolt-spacer">Wrong bolt &amp; spacer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not come with the correct bolt &amp; spacer configuration for my 55&rdquo; Samsung.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quick and easy install. Second mount I&rsquo;ve bought from this brand and I&rsquo;ve been happy with both</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to mount and holds up my 55&rdquo; Vizio tv.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install">Easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install. Fit perfectly in mounting a 65&rdquo; Sceptre. Tilt works great as well as the side to side shifting for perfect TV centering.</p>
