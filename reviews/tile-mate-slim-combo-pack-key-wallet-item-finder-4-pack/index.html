<h5 id="one-year-battery-life-then-buy-again-through-their-recycle-program">One year battery life then buy again through their &ldquo;recycle&rdquo; program</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Work pretty great, connected very easily and are all functioning as advertised. My only complaint about this product is that the battery only lasts one year and then you buy new tiles at their &ldquo;discounted price&rdquo;. So it becomes likes a permanent annual subscription and I assume replacement price are not as friendly as Amazons because they sell their tiles at a much higher price through their payment site. If they reform this policy to make the replacement tiles much cheaper I will stick with them, if not I&rsquo;ll probably just find whatever knockoff is around by next year considering this technology is just basic Bluetooth connectivity</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-original-and-still-the-best">The original and still the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are fantastic. I bought the TrackR originally, but they were nowhere near a replacement for the Tile. The new size of the Tile Slim is perfect for a wallet and the new Minis are just as-expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dies-in-a-year-whether-you-use-it-or-not">DIES IN A YEAR, whether you use it or not.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I second the review that complains about the Subscription Model. You have to buy a new one every year, like it or not. They&rsquo;re not very up front about it, burying this tiny little detail deep in the product description &ndash; you&rsquo;d seldom find it unless you knew what to look for. These things aren&rsquo;t cheap, and then they&rsquo;re dead in a year and they eagerly start hitting you with promos about buying a new one. I don&rsquo;t care how much they charge or how long they last as long as that information is prominently displayed and purchasers can make their own decision about the costs of owning the product over a set amount of time. But discovering my $30 purchase turned into a worthless piece of plastic was a big surprise to me, and if I&rsquo;d known that would happen when I&rsquo;d bought it I would have either not made the purchase (probably) or weighed the pros and cons and decided to live with that limitation. But keeping that info quiet is a deceptive business practice in my book.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="chimes-should-be-louder">Chimes should be louder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this as a gift for my daughter and son-in-law, who is always losing his keys, wallet. Unfortunately the chimes are so faint you can barely hear it. Not sure if it will help them find anything!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-product-hate-the-app">Love the product. Hate the app!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the product. Hate the app. I added one of these to my car keys and placed on inside my wallet for peace of mind. Product works fine. But the app sends annoying notifications and emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="useless-piece-of-tech">Useless piece of tech.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been contemplating buying these since long. Finally took a plunge and ordered the bundle pack of 4 (Mate and Slim). I was very excited to get these and install them to my key chain, mobile phone, and wallet.However, they did not even meet my expectations, leave alone exceeding them.Firstly, they were not functional at all. After installing I tried few quick tests, and they failed almost everyone of them.I asked my mobile phone app to locate my key chain (with tile installed), and it could not detect the same, even when I was standing right next to it.At one occasion when I finally got it to detect, and tried to beep the device, I could not hear the sound.When I went very close to my backpack where my tile was put (for test), I could barley hear something.However, I question that if I already knew the location of the device, what purpose the beep would serve? Go figure.Overall, I could not make use of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-one-key-feature-missing-alert-when-out-of-range">Just one key feature missing&hellip;alert when out of range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall this is a good product but, it would be better if there is a feature to alert me when I am out of range with my wallet or keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-trouble">Not worth the trouble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worst item ever. Unless you are right on top of it you&rsquo;ll never hear it. When you go to set it up on website you are given a tour of adds to buy more stuff, took forever to get through to what we needed. Sometimes the phone finder works (makes phone ring on silent) on the first try but usually you have to try a couple of times. Biggest problem is the sound if I am close enough to hear it I&rsquo;ve already found it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing">Disappointing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They rarely work. They unlink from each other all the time. I&rsquo;m honestly very disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="invaluable">Invaluable!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My only problem is I need more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-my-tile">Love my tile!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am currently a college student who has lots of keys, phone, wallets/IDs, and valuables that I want to keep track of.</p>

<h5 id="surprisingly-pleased-with-these">Surprisingly pleased with these!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these for the obvious reason, I lose my keys and wallet often. I was skeptical it would work, but after 3 weeks of use, I am happy to say that I really like the Tile&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-poor-product-and-poor-customer-service-from-amazon">Buyer Beware! Poor Product and Poor Customer Service From Amazon.</h5>

<p>Tried them. They&rsquo;re of no use at all. Did the troubleshooting with the Tiles company. No help there either.</p>

<p>I have had 2 replaced before a year was up because they just quit working. On the upside their customer service is great and replacements were promptly sent at no charge.</p>
