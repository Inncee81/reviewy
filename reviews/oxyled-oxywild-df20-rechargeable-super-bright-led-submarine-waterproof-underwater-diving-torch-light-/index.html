<h5 id="dove-to-92-feet-past-tuesday-this-pic-is-at-92ft-link-to-video-is-at-end-of-review">Dove to 92 feet past tuesday. This pic is at 92ft. Link to video is at end of review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a diver and a firefighter. I have purchased over 30 lights over the years. Most of them off Amazon. I am taking the time to write this because I am so impressed with it! First, it is amazing quality compared to others I&rsquo;ve purchased. Last unbelievably long. I took this Cavern diving this past Tuesday. I went to 92 feet with it on my wrist. Completely dry inside and worked as well as my dive partners$80 lights. I am purchasing more. I will have two on my firehelmet and two with me while diving. I included this YouTube video of past Tuesdays dive so you can see just how amazing it is in use. Its a 6 star light. I am the one with the light strapped to my wrist and have a yellow hose on my chest. Hard to believe this thing is this great for under 20 bucks!!![&hellip;][&hellip;]</p>

<h5 id="super-flashlight">Super flashlight!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works! It has a very nice, bright light, which I could imagine would light up a lava tube on the Big Island quite well. We bought two to use while snorkeling and/or hiking on the Big Island a few weeks from now. If you have trouble getting your flashlight to work, you probably put the AAA batteries in the wrong. You might also be frustrated because the item may seem to have come to you without an operators manual. Rest assured, the operators manual and warranty is there&hellip;they&rsquo;ve just been tucked underneath the extra strap provided inside your kit. Go hunting and you will find it! These are great little flashlights! I highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-inexpensive-backup-light">Great inexpensive backup light.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price it&rsquo;s hard to beat this as a backup dive light - especially for beginners. I&rsquo;m a dive professional, and I keep a grew of these in my bellows pocket as backups for students. Frequently they forget to bring a light or a backup, and I use these as a tertiary/loaner light.I personally dive a Sola 2500 SF as a primary, and Nova 700 as a backup, but for many beginner divers I recommend the Nova (or something similar) as a primary with this as a secondary.In a pinch it can be a primary, and I&rsquo;ve loaned them out as such several times. I generally like to loan out my Nova instead, but there have been occasions when multiple students don&rsquo;t have lights, so having 3 of these handy has really paid off.And on one night dive I had to do a direct ascent away from the buoy, and this was small enough I was able to attach it to my surface marker buoy with extra line before sending it up so my SMB was lit up for anyone in the area to see - super handy.Bang for the buck these have been some of the best items I&rsquo;ve purchased</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used ours now for 2 season in the pool. No problems. Very bright. Battery takes about half a day to recharge. Maybe they are all that way.No sharp edges to cut liner! Don&rsquo;t get a fancy machined bare aluminum light for your pool. Need two hands to turn on and off. Could be an issue for actual diving.Carry mine out snowplowing too. Like that it is plastic coated and small enough to hold in mouth if working and need both hands. Will be ordering a couple more this summer :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-diving-light-for-the-price">Great diving light for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used this flashlight for 4 night dives so far and it works good. I have noticed a tiny bit of moisture in the battery compartment but it hasn&rsquo;t hindered the operation of the flashlight. You should open it up after a dive anyway to air it out. The only drawback I see is that you need two hands to turn this on - one to hold the light and the other to twist the end. If you have this strapped to your hand, you cannot turn it on/off because you only have one hand to use and it&rsquo;s hard to twist the end with one hand. So I have it hanging from my Gear Keeper retractor so I can use both hands to turn it on/off. Otherwise I love this light for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great customer service. Originally I was disappointed with this product as it didn&rsquo;t work as well as I had hopped, but after my initial review the company reached out and offered to replace the light. The new light has worked great on three dives now and is still going strong. I must say I&rsquo;m impressed. The company stood by their warentee and their customer care team did a great job of fixing the issues I had with the product. This is a solid dive light that I use for dives with small caves and swim throughs. It also makes a great secondary light on night dives. The best part is if you ever have any issues the company will work to make it right.</p>

<h5 id="love-that-it-comes-with-a-lithium-rechargeable-battery-and">Love that it comes with a lithium rechargeable battery and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Talk about a bright light!! Wow. Love that it comes with a lithium rechargeable battery and charger too. LED technology is wonderful stuff, and this little light stays blindingly bright for hours on a single charge. Nicely straps on your wrist to shine where you point. The strobe mode is fun, but a total nuisance to me, and the on-off mechanism of rotating the bezel is cumbersome at best. Bottom line&hellip; Amazing value for the bucks!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exceeds-my-expectations">Exceeds my expectations.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review will cover my initial impressions of this light. I will not have a chance to actually dive with it for a few weeks, at which time I will update this. This flashlight arrived quickly via Amazon Prime shipping. It has, so far, exceeded my expectations. First, it comes in a handy hard plastic case. What I did not expect was the quality of the case, with egg-crate foam padding and four latches. The flashlight itself is a nice size and heft. It is nice and bright, with a well focused beam. It seems to be pretty tight, with almost no halo effect. There is a very solid loop molded into the body of the light, for the wrist-strap, which is also included. There is also a lanyard strap, a rechargeable battery, and a 3-battery clip for using standard AAA batteries. That is a lot of comprehensive equipment for this price point. The switch is integrated into the battery cap. Turn it once for bright. Turn it off and on for dim. Do it again for strobe. Pretty simple. There are three O-rings sealing the cap, and they are nicely greased with jelly. I am excited to try this out on my next dive!</p>
