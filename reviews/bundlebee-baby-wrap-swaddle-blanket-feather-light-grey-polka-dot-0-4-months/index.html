<li>100% cotton fabric/100% polyester filling/100% coconut fiber support insert</li>
<li>Imported</li>
<li>YOUR BABY WILL SLEEP BETTER AND SO WILL YOU! - Worried about getting sleep when the baby comes? This posh swaddling blanket hugs your baby girl or boy creating a mother&rsquo;s womb effect. Your baby will sleep like a baby! The thick and plush cocoon creates a feeling of being wrapped in a blanket but leaves wiggle room for those little ones that like to sleep with their arms free. The comforter-like wrap creates &ldquo;boundaries&rdquo; for the startle reflex without having to be swaddled.</li>
<li>HEAD-TO-TOE PROTECTION &ndash; Are you worried about friends, family or siblings wanting to hold your new bundle of joy? BundleBee wrap comes with built-in removable organic coconut fiber pad lining the back and provides support and protection for baby&rsquo;s tiny head and spine. The mattress-like insert allows people to, more or less, &ldquo;pass&rdquo; the baby around without any fear of baby&rsquo;s head to fall back.</li>
<li>EASY TRANSITION TO A CRIB - BundleBee baby wrap works like a portable baby bed and it fits perfectly in a bassinet or a co-sleeper. So, if your little one starts off in a bassinet or co-sleeping with you, this blanket makes the transition to a crib super easy. You can wrap your little one in a BundleBee, put her down to sleep in a family room for example and not wake her when you carry her in the wrap to a crib later.</li>
<li>BE THE TALK OF THE BABY SHOWER &ndash; This swaddle is simple, practical and cute. Made with top quality materials. Beautifully packaged, it&rsquo;s ready to gift. Guaranteed to be the most unique item at the shower. The new mom-to-be will love the easy use and care of this blanket &ndash; simple as 1-2-3 fold, machine washable, holds up well in a dryer. This ultimate swaddle is also perfect for a newborn photoshoot. The new baby will look adorable with the large wide ribbon/bow that comes with the blanket</li>

<li><p>PERFECT FOR SUMMER OR WINTER &ndash; This wrap is great for all seasons. The feather light filling keeps your baby cool in the summer and warm during winter and reduces sweating or overheating. Your baby will be nice and cozy in the air conditioned spaces and when you are ready for a walk with a bassinet stroller, simply move the bundle to the stroller and never worry about needing a different blanket. The Velcro makes the wrap adjustable so you can decide how tight or lose the pouch should be.</p>

</ul>

<p>Color:Feather Light/Grey Polka Dot  |  Size:0-4 Months
BundleBee baby wrap is one of a kind product that is a cross between a down-like swaddling blanket and a carrier. It is perfect to use in a crib, a bassinet or a bassinet stroller. BundleBee wrap has an insert made out of coconut fibers that provides comfortable back and neck support. The coconut insert allows you to hold or carry the baby while she is asleep without waking her up. It also protects your baby and apposes back and neck when friends and family hold her. Since new babies start to move and wiggle after 2 or 3 weeks after birth, traditional swaddles stop being effective quickly. BundleBee wrap is designed to provide room for natural baby movements while they rest or sleep. At the same time, BundleBee wrap is made out of down-like material that still hugs the babies like a normal swaddle. BundleBee wrap is filled with high-quality, hypoallergenic polyester that will not cause overheating or sweating. It will not change shape after washing. The 100% cotton feels great to your baby and apposes delicate skin. BundleBee baby wrap is easy to wrap up or adjust the size. Just fold the bottom up and then fold each side over. Align the Velcro strips and it is done in 10 seconds tops. Velcro strips let you adjust the size of the bundle. Best for babies from birth to 4 months old.</p>

<h5 id="new-mom">new mom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw the item and was curious so I bought it. Shipping didn&rsquo;t take long at all. My baby does not like to be traditionally swaddled she for some reason need her two arms out. So this item is perfect for her. Then the other good thing is when she falls asleep it is easy to do so you don&rsquo;t have to wake a sleeping baby. Now my only thing I&rsquo;m not excited about is the material inside isn&rsquo;t too good. So if she lays down once all the material there moved. So when I put her down again at 3am I feel it&rsquo;s super hard where her head goes. And at 3am if the baby is sleeping you don&rsquo;t have the to fluff it for herREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-babies-that-hate-their-arms-pinned-down">Perfect for babies that hate their arms pinned down.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not be happier with this product. My one month old won&rsquo;t sleep in anything else but this. This wrap is great for babies that do not like to be swaddled tightly. My son throws a fit if his arms are pinned down. The bundlebee allows his arms to be wrapped but allow them to move as he pleases. My only concern is what I&rsquo;m going to do once he&rsquo;s outgrown it! They need to make bigger sizes for older babies as well&hellip; PLEASE 😊READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is by far my baby&rsquo;s favorite thing! He absolutely loves it! He has been using it since he came home from the hospital and I foresee a long lasting relationship. Whenever his siblings hold him I don&rsquo;t have to worry about his neck or back because there is a firm pad that lines the back. Thank you so much for making new motherhood easier👍👏💖READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="would-buy-this-again-in-a-heartbeat">Would buy this again in a heartbeat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy with this purchase. Initially I thought it was a bit too expensive but I bought it with a gift card and I am so glad I did. It is so comfortable for the baby he doesn&rsquo;t move when he&rsquo;s in there. And there is back support for him so when people hold him it gives more security as he is only two weeks old. From now on anyone is getting this for a shower present.READ MORE</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe how cute my little one looked wrapped up in this! We used it for co sleeping but she grew out of it pretty fast unfortunately. I&rsquo;m waiting to pass it on to a friend for their baby! I think this would be an awesome baby shower gift.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-swaddler">Great swaddler!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 2 of these in the beige check for 2 babies born 12 days apart. 1st went to the new little girl &amp; her mama loved it because of all the friends &amp; family who wanted to hold her &amp; she felt alright with it after she saw how well the bundle bee gave overall support to the baby. 2nd went to the new baby boy &amp; his mom said that it was by far the best swaddling garment she received. Both new moms told me that their babies slept much more peaceful in the bundle bee, especially if they were extra fuzzy. Great product!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="they-gave-me-the-replacement-items-in-a-best-customer-service">They gave me the replacement items in a best customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product and customer service. I bought one and I loved it at first. But after I washed it, I accidentally broke the underneath pad and it&rsquo;s ribbon. So I contacted writing a bad experiment review to the seller and they emailed me they would replace me the hard pad and a new ribbon and reminded me to take it out before I wash the wrap. That was so nice of them. I received my replacement items yesterday and I was totally satisfied with that. They even sent me a card sorrying what made me unsatisfied. I can tell they are the best customer service ever.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="he-nestles-down-in-it-and-sleeps-like-a-baby">He nestles down in it and sleeps like a baby</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My newborn LOVES his &ldquo;cocoon&rdquo;! I put him in it during the day while in his Rock n Play sleeper. He nestles down in it and sleeps like a baby! I do have to make sure his airway is always open because he can slip down in it too far sometimes, but it has never been an issue. I also love this because it has a hard cardboard surface that helps when holding a newborn, especially when letting strangers hold the baby (that aren&rsquo;t comfortable with babies and their wobbly heads). My only complaint is that after I washed it, it shrunk and the cardboard won&rsquo;t fit in its flap correctly now. I have to safety pin it to get it covered now. But since my baby loves it so much, I still give it 5 stars! Anything that gets a baby to sleep and stay asleep deserves 10 stars!!READ MORE</p>
