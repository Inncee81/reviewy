<p> Exactly what I was looking for. I&rsquo;m not a hunter but I love wildlife. I also wanted something to keep an eye on our back door where deliveries are left. This fit the bill perfectly.It was super easy to setup. Just pop in batteries (8 AA-not included) which will last roughly 6 months depending on usage. After that you just make a few adjustments using the setup screen like time, date, format your SD card, choose if you want to take photos/videos or both, how long to record, and how long to wait between recordings. I have it set to take a picture then record for 10 seconds. Then it will go into standby mode for 30 seconds so that same animal won&rsquo;t keep triggering it. All of these times and lengths can be adjusted to your preference.It also came with mounting hardware for a permanent install or you can use the included strap to mount it in a tree which is also easily removable. I have it positioned on a tree in my backyard that focuses on my back door and also where we get a lot of animals wandering around. Here in PA we get bears, turkey, deer, fox, neighborhood dogs, and countless other critters. I&rsquo;m like a kid on Christmas morning whenever I go check what the camera recorded haha!While I would&rsquo;ve liked to have had a 1080p camera this 720p version is quite adequate for it&rsquo;s purpose. The images and video come through clear and it picks up audio very well too although you can shut the sound off if you wish. I was super impressed with the night camera ability. In the daytime it takes color pics/video and at night they come through in black and white. I took a sample pic in a pitch black room and you can see how bright and clear it was. I also included 3 video clips as well.The 8MB pixel resolution, night vision, built in mic, and crisp video make this a great buy for the price. My only nitpick is that it only supports SD cards up to 32GB. I wish it were higher but it will overwrite old stuff so it&rsquo;s not a huge deal. 32GB is actually a lot for 720p video and pictures but I would&rsquo;ve liked to have the option of throwing in a 128GB card. Other than that I&rsquo;m really happy with it&rsquo;s performance, especially at this price!</p>

<h5 id="the-best-hunting-camera-for-the-price">The best hunting camera for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not an avid hunter, but a couple of times during the year, I like to go hunting, just not to forget how to shoot. I was browsing Amazon for a cheap hunting camera. Usually, the word “cheap” is often associated with the word “bad”. But looks like I managed to find a great combination of quality and price.I was a bit afraid to buy this camera because some reviewers mentioned bad picture quality, but I gave it a try and I&rsquo;m glad I did. Don&rsquo;t expect this camera to shoot like Canon D80, but it&rsquo;s really nice. Actually, the picture quality was even better than I expected. You&rsquo;re not supposed to make selfies with it and post it on Facebook, this is a hunting camera and picture quality is pretty decent.It&rsquo;s been a fun learning the best places to position this camera for good pictures. Definitely took some trial and error. I love how it automatically switches between infrared and regular color pictures depending on whether it is day or night. Set up was easy and straightforward. You get a quick start guide and an instruction booklet that breaks down all the different options and settings.I like how the pictures include a date/time stamp and also include the temperature. I&rsquo;m still playing around with the different settings so I can get different results. I was using single picture mode, but now I&rsquo;m using the burst mode so I can get multiple pictures when the motion sensor is triggered.It&rsquo;s equipped with an 8MP camera and full 720p, which is not cutting edge, but it’ll certainly do the job and it stands out as one of the best offerings among similarly comparable competitors. This trail camera is ready to keep up with any demands out of the box, you just need an SD card and eight AA batteries. I didn&rsquo;t have an opportunity to test battery life in this camera, but the company claims it&rsquo;s 6 months, hope it&rsquo;ll be like that.Nighttime photos are better than expected for IR. If the animal is close enough and not moving too quick you can get a good shot. I recommend setting up the camera in a situation where you’re shooting night photos at about half the recommended distance for maximum results.TIP: the batteries that you choose are almost as important as the camera. Don’t expect that the dollar store cheapies are going to last a long time in a high-powered camera. They may last long enough to take a few shots, then they are rendered useless. High-quality rechargeable lithium batteries do cost significantly more but are well worth the investment.</p>

<h5 id="updated-review-apeman-responded-quickly">Updated review - Apeman responded quickly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Though our first camera only lasted 6 months, an Apeman customer service person returned our email and they promptly replaced the camera. We have only had it a few days but it seems to be constructed better than the last one. We will keep you posted as to how things work out.It is too bad that something only has a month warranty but I but since it only lasted 6 months I guess that is all that one could expect. It worked pretty good while it lasted but it did go through quite a few batteries. I would not advise buying this product unless you only want it for a short period of time.</p>

<h5 id="new-technologies-are-amazing">New technologies are amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As I biologist I like observing wildlife and I am interested in zoology. My work requires true and precise data about animals in their natural habitat. Just set up you camera in some hidden place and turn on video recording. Video lasts about 10 minutes. It is enough to capture some interesting animal and record it. This camera works even in night-time. Just be sure that the option night vision is turned on. Images will be clear as in day-time. The very instruction for camera is understandable and concise. It explains everything you have to know about it. It helped me to learn a lot on new functions and used them in my experiments. My colleagues also bought some of them to apply cameras in laboratory conditions. I remained contented and even happy. New technologies are amazing!</p>

<h5 id="best-camera-on-the-market">best camera on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For starters the overall build is exceptional. The price is seriously hard to beat if you don&rsquo;t mind off brand. this night vision is on par as well, I included a video I took of my dad leaving the house to go walk our dog, and you can clearly see him. i do wish that it came with the external power cord for input of power but I&rsquo;m sure i can buy that from Amazon. I look forward to using this as our security presence for package thieves.</p>
