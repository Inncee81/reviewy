<blockquote>
<p>I recently ordered four of the highest-rated, low cost portable Bluetooth speakers for comparison. My intent was to buy the one I liked best for my personal use when travelling and to return the others. Following are my non-professional impressions.The products I purchased from Amazon, and the prices I actually paid, were:Sony SRSX11 $48DKnight MagicBox II $35Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 $30Anker Classic $37I played a variety of music on each of them, including Van Morrison, Miles Davis, U2 and Pink Floyd, constantly rotating between the speakers mid-song as I compared their sound.1. The Anker was by far the least impressive. It sounded tinny and flat with little or no bass. Very disappointing and was an easy reject, the first to go back into its box.2. The OontZ Angle sounded pretty good at first, and showed excellent midrange and treble notes. It also played at a nice loud volume. I liked it a lot but ultimately I noticed the bass response was lacking and it sounded a little thin compared to the remaining others, so it was next to go. Too bad, because I liked the styling of it, and the fact that, unlike the others, it had no annoying blue light to bother me in a dark room.The last two standing were a tough choice, but …3. The MagicBox was really good and almost won out. It had a full sound and great style, but in the end I found it didn’t have the best range from highs to lows that I heard in the Sony. Just not quite enough bass to make me happy. If it had been the only one I’d heard I would have been quite happy with it, and felt sad to send it back.4. The Sony was totally surprising given its very small size. I thought it would be easy to rule out before I heard it, but it kept impressing me with its excellent bass response and midrange tones. I’d say it has a cleaner sound overall. Maybe in this case, a little higher cost is worth the price. I’m keeping this one, knowing it’ll fill up a hotel room with great sound.Hope this helps, and happy listening!</p>

<h5 id="these-speakers-are-great-great-sound">These speakers are great. Great sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These speakers are great. Great sound, great volume capability, each unit has three speakers. Not only are they useful for music they work very well with my iPhone as a speaker, easy to carry around as you move about, set them down a talk away, then move and continue. Do get a pair, well worth the small additional cost. Only need one for speaker phone use in case you were wondering.</p>

<h5 id="good-sound-can-come-in-small-packages-too">Good sound can come in small packages too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just picked this up a few hours ago and did what any self-respecting geek would do: I measured it&rsquo;s frequency response. Impressive considering it&rsquo;s size! Essentially flat response, tapering off at about 175 Hz on the low end, and 15 kHz on the high. Big sonic upgrade from the SRSBTV5.</p>

<h5 id="the-speaker-sounds-great-for-about-10-minutes">The speaker sounds great for about 10 minutes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to change my review (see below) . I didn&rsquo;t realize that when the battery is low, the speaker will start off at full volume &amp; then get real quiet after about 10 minutes. Because we read some other reviews on the web that said it did this with apple products- WRONG! I gave it a full charge &amp; have been listening to it for 4 and a half hours straight at high volume and it sounds awesome!The speaker sounds great for about 10 minutes, then the volume drops out. I tried it on my iphone and my Ipad and it happened on both. I had to turn the speaker off &amp; remove the device from my phone &amp; ipad, and then re pair it. We looked on the web for reviews &amp;discussions &amp; found that this is a problem for a lot of Apple device owners. Apparently it has to be repaired every 10 or 15 minutes, which makes a very inconvenient. I&rsquo;m going to try to return it.</p>

<h5 id="good-sound-and-value-in-a-small-little-package">Good sound and value in a small little package.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very impressed by this little speaker. It produces good sound, seems to have great battery life and is very compact. We have packed this speaker across the country to provide us tunes while on vacation and use it often at home with our 3 young kids, who enjoy spontaneous dance parties in whichever room of the house we are in. We often take it to the neighborhood pool which it has held up nicely for, even without being waterproof. The only negative I&rsquo;ve found is that if you really pump up the volume the sound does get distorted. But for such a small speaker it does a great job, especially at the price point this comes in at.</p>

<h5 id="sony-srsx11-ultra-portable-bluetooth-speaker-blue">Sony SRSX11 Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Blue)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I reviewed numerous similar sized Bluetooth speakers before buying this one. I am elated that I did. the sound is loud, distortion free, crisp ,clean and reasonable good bass. My friends and colleagues are amazed and impressed to say the least and want one!. It can fill an office or hotel room or even large space with music. High quality construction and feel - not cheap or plastic-like. Will sit well on most surfaces. Fits easily into my briefcase or pocket. Fantastic product!!</p>

<h5 id="the-outsanding-sony-srsx11-ultra-portable-bluetooth-speaker">The outsanding Sony SRSX11 Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Speaker&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>YES! YES! YES!!! These little cubes are amazing! First charge them up. Took me six hours. Then just Bluetooth them in and pair them. (I bought two for stereo.) And these things actually do run for eight full hours! Never expect that. The sound is full and pleasing. The only problem is that going back to the laptop speakers is now almost unbearable. Fast shipping and best price from this seller. Great purchase.., very pleased.</p>

<h5 id="extremely-low-volume-when-not-fully-charged">Extremely low volume when not FULLY charged</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really surprised no one mentioned in their review that this little speaker loses its ability to have high volume when it isn&rsquo;t fully charged. You can barely hear it from 10 feet away when it kicks into this mode! It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating considering without use, just sitting on the counter without playing anything it loses charge in about 12 hours. Then, you plug the unit in and it doesn&rsquo;t bring the volume back up until it fully charges again, We ordered a second unit thinking it was defective but had the same problem the second time around. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this product.</p>
