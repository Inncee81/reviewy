<h5 id="let-there-be-sound">Let there Be Sound!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a professional hearing exam and was told I needed hearing aids to boost high frequency response in both ears. I declined to buy a set of $4,000 hearing aids.Instead I went on Amazon.com and ordered a single NewEar BTE Digital Hearing Amplifier for about $50. The results were so dramatic I immediately ordered a second one. I wear both with the volume turned down to the first level, they work every bit as good as the audiologist’s in-office demonstration of what I should expect from his $4,000 product.It will take a little getting used to for wearing them to be completely comfortable, but now the refrigerator is making all sorts of noises instead of just an indistinct dull whirring noise. I can actually hear the refrigerator fan when it is running.For about a $100 a whole world of new sound has opened up to me. Splashing of water in the sink produces almost musical tones although the simple tearing of a piece of paper is now a sound of almost indescribable violence. The clinking of dishes is sharp and pronounced, something I’m going to have to get used to.Thanks to Amazon.com I saved myself $3900 and can hear things I have been missing for years. The NewEar BTE Digital Hearing Amplifier is a definitely a great buy.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-for-the-right-situations">Good product for the right situations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a diagnosed hearing loss and my issue is specific to the low end range of voices. Put 2 people both 10 feet away from me in a meeting room and I can hear one person just fine, but if the other person speaks softly or in a lower tone, I will miss about half of what they say. I really need either hearing aids or a stapedectomy, but both are very expensive.I got this to wear in meetings a work. It is basically an amplifier. It is not great in noisy places, but in a quiet conference room where voices are the only sound, it does its job. I only got one, and I realized my other ear seems to compensate and hear less, like my brain is trying to process all the sound from the amplified ear. It would probably be more balanced with two of these.Some other reviews mentioned a hissing noise. I heard it when I cranked up the volume, but I found the lowest volume setting to be fairly loud and did not need to turn it up beyond that level. If you needed the loudest setting, I could see how that could be annoying.This device is conspicuous. People will notice you are wearing it, unlike more expensive hearing aids. So if you have an issue with that, you may want to look elsewhere.Bottom line, for the purpose, it is a good product that does what it says. It is not really a long term substitute for hearing aids or surgery, but can bridge the gap in some situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-stars">no stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update on the hearing aide. it no longer works. It won&rsquo;t charge. Worked fine till a week ago when it would no longer take a charge. I&rsquo;m a 66 year old woman so it wasn&rsquo;t abused. I wore it about 4 days a week to work, charged it overnight every night. Lasted exactly 2 months. It isn&rsquo;t battery back up so it went in the trash today. I expected it would last maybe a year or so but 2 months is a complete waste of money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="far-better-than-paying-out-of-pocket">Far better than paying out of pocket</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Most know that hearing aids are scams; even the ones from inside the hospital. 5 years ago it was $4000; this year it was $1520 all digital. Both had constant squeal and wind noise; constants up/down with volume. Even with the unit digital and guaranteed to either take away or minimize. All fail. I have gotten the over the back of ear models and I forget too easily. My &ldquo;new&rdquo; one just squeals and blasts screams that 3 visits driving 52 miles round could not get it. An Inspector during the process of buying our new home highly recommended this kind of product. The New Ear brand does the exact same thing as the more expensive 2d model. Huge microphone, but I can hear. I believe the other brand was Micro-Ear; may try that one to; after all at this price point I could have a different style for each day. Seriously, it does what it says; fits better than expensive models. I am totally deaf in left ear and this one truly makes up for it whereas the expensive ones have not. Re-proves that old saying all those roadside hearing aids that will cost you way over $1500 for the least features can be done with this $73 model.</p>

<h5 id="exceeds-expectations">Exceeds expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were looking for something to aid with my husband&rsquo;s hearing loss since he had lost 50% hearing in both ears due to nerve damage from chemotherapy. Of course, ENT specialists wanted to sell him hearing aids for up to $5000! Since we are unsure of his prognosis he refused to pay that much money for something he might only be using for a short period of time. I was looking for something that would be easy for him to handle, not too small but with good amplification &amp; not too cheap&hellip;because you get what you pay for, but not too expensive either because he would need one for each ear, &amp; so we could have the TV at a normal level &amp; we wouldn&rsquo;t have to shout for him to hear what we were saying. The reviews for this amplifier were very helpful &amp; mostly positive. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how long the batteries would last, but he has had this for almost a month &amp; we have only changed batteries once &amp; he wears it all day. Of course, you do have to remember to turn it off when you are not wearing it. The amplification is very good &amp; many times he has to turn it down if there are a lot of people talking along w/TV, etc. And he has to turn them off when going to a movie theatre! Comfort level is excellent; he tends to forget he is even wearing them. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone to try before spending thousands buying conventional hearing aids.Paula K.</p>

<h5 id="way-better-than-the-ones-they-sell-at-walmart-and-pharmacies">WAY better than the ones they sell at Walmart and Pharmacies &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 5th amplifier from various manufacturers. With that said this seems to work well so far except it screeches when I reach back to adjust it from time to time. It also is more noticeable than some of the others I&rsquo;ve purchased. I does hold a charge all day so for that I give it 4 stars. You just never know about these amplifiers until you actually use them for awhile. WAY better than the ones they sell at Walmart and Pharmacies though.</p>
