<h5 id="great-for-plus-sized-women-actual-measurement-in-review">Great for Plus sized women! Actual measurement in review!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this carrier! Was worried about buying anything online because I&rsquo;m plus sized &amp; scared it wouldn&rsquo;t fit,so I made a ring sling carrier &amp; it was a pain to get adjusted with or without the baby in it. I was going to buy more fabric &amp; make the wrap style carriers but the fabric was $5 a yard and I needed a lot, so I started looking online &amp; found this. It&rsquo;s super comfy, easy to use, stylish even. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;2, 250lbs and it fits fine with room to spare. The shorter part ties around your waist, you then cris-cross the longer straps in the back and you bring it back to the front &amp; tie it(If that makes sense). The straps are wide &amp; have plenty of padding so they don&rsquo;t dig into your shoulders. The description doesn&rsquo;t have any measurements except &ldquo;adjustable&rdquo; &amp; being plus sized that&rsquo;s always scary not knowing how big it actually is, so I got a measurement! A 36in measuring tape was all I had &amp; that was exactly half as in the picture! So 72 inches in what you have to work with to tie around the waist &amp; there&rsquo;s plenty of extra shoulder strap length no matter what size you are! Excuse the pictures just wanted to show an example that it fits all sizes!</p>

<h5 id="works-great-for-plus-sized-moms">Works great for plus-sized moms</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a miserable time babywearing baby #1 in both a Moby and a hand-me-down Bjorn because of pre-existing mid-back pain, so with baby #2, I picked up an Ergobaby and this Infantino, determined to make something work. I was shocked when the Ergobaby, a full $100 more expensive, was beaten out by the dirt-cheap Infantino Mei Tai. I&rsquo;ve realized that a lot of these shell carriers really work only if you have no chest and no tummy, which is pretty unrealistic for postpartum moms. Some of them don&rsquo;t really work on short moms either. I&rsquo;m a size 20, 5&rsquo;2&rdquo;, with a short torso and a large chest. If that sounds like you, then you probably also can&rsquo;t make some of the long/sleek carriers work because of their length and their reliance on your having no breasts where they want to position the baby inside the carrier. Quick thoughts on the four we tried:Moby: Way too hot, way too much unnecessary material, always felt as if the baby was about to pitch out. Upside? Husband looks like a Jedi wearing a baby. Does work for a newborn and for plus-sizers, but I hated wearing it. I worried endlessly that the baby would suffocate and usually needed a hand to support the baby anyway.Old-school Bjorn: Husband loved it for him once baby #1 was old enough to face out, but it killed my back and spread baby&rsquo;s legs awkwardly. Doesn&rsquo;t work on a newborn either. Bonus? Has survived a solid hundred machine washes.Ergobaby with newborn insert: I actually laughed at myself in the mirror when it tried this on. It looks super sleek on thin models, but on me, it was a lumpy, misshapen mess, especially with the baby in the insert. It&rsquo;s a maze of uncomfortable straps meant for much taller women, and it&rsquo;d work for a newborn in the insert only if you have relatively small breasts, otherwise baby will be pushed far away from you, unsafely. The newborn pillow seat also sat right where my tummy is and will likely be while she&rsquo;s, you know, still a newborn, which also pushed out the whole contraption away from my body. Gorgeous material, though (I had the camel before I sent it back), and the pocket was awesome, but the hood that you can&rsquo;t detach that has to be stuffed into the pocket was a puzzling drawback for a $125 carrier. Ironically, it&rsquo;d probably work great on a man.Infantino Mei Tai: The mei tai&rsquo;s become my go-to for my newborn. It does put more pressure on the lower back and much less on the upper back, so I don&rsquo;t think I could wear it more than a few hours, but that&rsquo;s a few hours more than I could wear anything else. The fact that you can tie the waist strap and the cross strap at different heights and lengths basically means that this thing is customizable on the fly with very little trouble, can be easily switched between parents without readjustment, and conforms to different body types and sizes. The cross strap, for example, can go around the middle of my newborn and hold her in close over my chest regardless of my size with no danger of her tipping out the top or sides. While I can&rsquo;t see myself being able to breastfeed in it (just too awkward), a small bottle did work. I have found that it requires adjustment as baby sinks a little bit over time and the cross strap inches upward, but that&rsquo;s not really a problem. Also, the padded shoulder straps are comfy but wind up not lying flat on my chest, so those could use some tweaking. The soft material does pick up a lot of cat hair, but my kid peed on it the first time I wore it (naturally), and it machine-washed just fine. I&rsquo;d love to add a pocket to it at some point. Wish it came in more styles because it&rsquo;s cheap enough that I&rsquo;d like to have several in different looks.Verdict: You don&rsquo;t always get what you pay for by going with the expensive brands. Sometimes the cheap but traditional style really does work better in messy real life vs. idyllic photo shoots.</p>

<h5 id="how-did-i-not-know-about-this-until-my-second-baby">How did I not know about this until my second baby?!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When i first saw this Mei Tai I was very excited. I made a deal with my husband that we would not be usung the infant carseat carrier like parents typically do, I wanted to wear my LO. I have a hiking back carrier, afront to back carrier, a sling, and a moby wrap. The moby was my favorite of all of those, until recently. I wanted something with the ease and comfort of a moby with more air flow, its springtime and the moby was overheating baby and I. Having a toddler and a newborn I wanted a carrier that did not take as much time and effort as the moby.PROS: 1. More breatheable than the long, all body encompassing moby.2. It is super easy to put on. I have read reviews where people find wrapping this daunting. I cannot see how, the instructions are very clear and I watched videos on how to out this on before I even bought it. So the first time I tried it I had a perfect and comfortable fit. But, I am also used to the moby so nothing is complicated after learning all the different wraps and positons in that.3. Much faster to put in than the moby! With a toddler and fussy baby that is a HUGE plus!4. It is comfortable does not make my back hurt like the front to back carrier that we have. That thing is awful with all the buckles and bulk, I can&rsquo;t get it tight enough either and thats an issue with the sized straps that you can only adjust so much. The Mei Tai ties to exactly my size and my husbands size without re-adjusting all the buckles and straps while you have a crying baby that just wants to be held.5. This folds quite compactly, much better than any carrier I have ever seen. I cloth diaper so my diaper bag is slightly more stuffed than a typical one with dispoasables, although we dont have to lug bottles or formula around because we exclusively breastfeed. So the less bulk the better. This fits nicely in my bag if I need to take it off, unlike the moby which was far to big to stuff in my bag.6. Sturdy material with nice padding for ease of wear. The padding almost feels like memory foam and isnt nearly as thick and bulky and the front to back carrier. Much more comfortable.7. It is cute and people want to know what it is!8. SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN OTHER Mei Tai&rsquo;s!CONS: 1. The straps are long and can easily get dirty if you are wrapping it in a public place where the ground is dirty. I know the long straps are necessary so I tie it next to the car so I can drape the straps inside and I know baby is safe in his car seat while I wrap until im ready to put him in. So there are ways around this con for sure just takes a little more effort and thought.EDIT 4/20/2013: We have used this for over a year now and I still love this carrier just as much as before. I have added a Beco Butterfly II and a Maya Wrap Ring Sling to my stash. These three are my favorite carriers all for different reasons. For baby and I together the Mei Tai is still number one. I LOVE the perfect fit I get out of it, I love that it takes me a total of 15 seconds to tie it on, adjusting the fit is a breeze, my back never hurts when I wear this even on all day outings/walks/hiking. I wear my 14 month old in it and still use the front carry far more than the back carry, I prefer to be able to touch, kiss and talk to my baby. I find that I&rsquo;m always trying to twist my neck to interact when he&rsquo;s in the back carry.This is the carrier to beat! I don&rsquo;t have experience with a more expensive brand but at this point (after many washes and wear) I don&rsquo;t see the need to test out an expensive one.</p>
