<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="best-made-target-i-have-seen">Best made target I have seen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading reviews on every target net I could find, I decided to go with this one. So many others looked good but it seemed the quality was lacking. My son wants to start pitching so I wanted something that would give him some visual queues as to the strike zone. I also like the net so the wilder pitches get stopped as well. This frame and net are extremely well made. The pieces fit together perfectly and it is easy to put together and take apart. Bonus for coming with a bag. I take this with me to team practice and let all the kids that are interested in pitching throw at it. It comes with some anchor spikes to hold the net steady and upright but so far I haven&rsquo;t needed these, even in the strong Oklahoma wind. It has never once even tipped back a little. The other nice thing is I have my son hit into it as well. He is 9 so he doesn&rsquo;t have tons of power but this net stops balls very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-pleased">Highly pleased !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely pleased!!!! Very quick and easy to assemble and dismantle for travel use. Light weight and being so allows for easy carrying with other equipment in the bag that comes with it. We use it for both baseball pitching and batting. Be sure to use the ground spikes to help secure the net from tipping over if you are batting up close. We also remove the strike zone netting when we do batting exercises. The frame has taken hits from pitching and batting with no issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wish-that-i-had-known-about-rukket-nets-earlier">Wish that i had known about Rukket nets earlier&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, so good.Bought the 5×5 to replace a 7×7 big mouth in the garage. It takes up less room, and does a good job of keeping the balls in place. My son takes 100+ swings a day and I&rsquo;m the hitting coach for a 10u travel team, so we&rsquo;re pretty hard on our equipment. The material appears very sturdy and the netting seems tougher than the material on our present net (which has copious amounts of Gorilla tape holding it together). Since this net will stay assembled and out of the weather, I expect it to last for many years to come.The carrying bag is also made from a more durable material than that of my other net, (which is also covered with Gorilla tape and looks like black burlap). A definite plus for those of us that use these 4-5 times a week for games and practices. (Set it up, break it down - repeat).All in all, pretty happy with my purchase; which was less than half of what I paid for my other net. I will probably buy the 7×7 Rukket for travel ball practice as my other net is on its last legs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-backyard-reps">Great for backyard reps</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter got this for Christmas this year and so far, it&rsquo;s been fantastic! Extremely easy to dis/assemble and solid all around. The included pitching target is great for working top to bottom of the strike zone without a batter. I&rsquo;ve tried hitting into it too and it&rsquo;s just as good, if not better, than those tubular steel frame nets we used to use when I played baseball. The carrying case is great because there&rsquo;s more than enough room for extra equipment. I carry my Tanner tee and some practice balls in there and there&rsquo;s still room for more stuff. Probably going to end up getting the 7x7 net as well for the travel team I&rsquo;m coaching this year.Since my daughter is still learning to use the tee effectively, she&rsquo;ll occasionally hit under the ball and pop it over the top of the net when working on the high pitches. Not a huge deal because it doesn&rsquo;t go far and only miss-hits really could go over the top, but it&rsquo;s a 5x5 net so it&rsquo;s not super tall. Still a 5 star product.</p>

<h5 id="setup-was-pretty-easy-the-box-comes-with-a-photo-based">Setup was pretty easy. The box comes with a photo based &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 7 year old is entering year 2 of little league and they have introduced pitching and he loves it. We purchased this and a bucket of baseballs so my son can put this up and pitch till his heart is content. Setup was pretty easy. The box comes with a photo based instruction sheet. One of the first instructions says to connect the two straight pieces together which was a little confusing as i had 2 poles that were mostly straight but had a little bend around them middle of each pipe. Wasn&rsquo;t sure if these were defective or i was missing parts. Watched the youtube video (referenced in the instructions) and was able to see that these are in fact the pipes in question. After that setup was a breeze. Took about 5 minutes putting it together myself. When my son got home from practice (8pm!) he immediately started practicing with this in the house. I switched him over to tennis balls for indoor practice leaving the hardballs for outside. He loves it, and loves aiming for the different strike zones. Well put together, very sturdy in my opinion. I&rsquo;ll report back in a few months with an update after we work this in a little more.</p>

<h5 id="very-handy-product">Very handy product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve used this 3 times so far for pitching and catching batting practice. I have a 12 &amp; 18 year old that are using it. Easy to setup. It is holding up pretty well so far. One of the bungee&rsquo;s that connects the net to the frame at the bottom broke loose and I had re-crimp the ring holding it on. I&rsquo;m hoping it isn&rsquo;t going to be an ongoing issue.I do wish the anchors were a little better. If you have a kid throwing 70+mph, any low or errant pitch that hits the frame or bottom of the net will knock it loose. The anchors don&rsquo;t hold it in place very well after a few hits nor do the anchors hold up well in a dense clay based soil. Two of them are already bent from pushing them into the ground.Overall, this saves a lot of time since it catches the balls for us. The kids get to practice throwing when I&rsquo;m not able to catch for them. Also, saves me some bumps and bruises by taking me out of the firing line. The adjustable strike zone is pretty cool. You can turn pitching practice into a game by seeing how many times you can hit the various target squares. Definitely helps them focus on throwing strikes. They also tend to practice more. I wish I had bought this thing years ago. The kids really like using it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did a lot of research on nets like this. I chose this one because of the lifetime warranty. Most reviews from other nets on the market complained of being cheaply made and not lasting. This was a birthday gift for my 5 year old grandson who is showing a great talent in T Ball. My son in law says this is a very well made net. Great quality. My grandson loves it. And so does his little brother. I&rsquo;m a happy shopper. Notice in the pictures that the net is set up right in front of their car. That&rsquo;s how well it&rsquo;s made.</p>
