At various points during the exercise, you&rsquo;ll work every major upper body muscle group as your torso adjusts to the movements. The dual ab wheel comes with an instructional fitness guide.</p>

<h5 id="effective-but-overpriced-at-15-bucks">Effective but overpriced at 15 bucks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this Valeo ab wheel almost 4 years ago and didn&rsquo;t try it until about two weeks ago. Well, this thing will workout your abs for sure. First time I used it, I was thinking I would b able to bang out 4 sets of 10 rollouts on my knees with ease, but only managed one set of 10, and that was that for my first ab wheel workout&hellip;felt like I was gonna bust open if I continued. I was sore for four days which kinda shocked me bc I do other exercises such as kettlebell swings, chinups, dips, squates, and these all make your core work hard, or so I read&hellip;I guess not that hard. Fast forward about two weeks and now I can bang out 4 sets of 10 with good form. I read some reviews where people complained about how this thing is dangerous and could cause injury &ndash; there r plenty of useful vids online explaining proper form &ndash; but the way I perform the rollout is to keep the head looking down, chin tucked to avoid neck strain, and slightly rounded back to avoid hyperextension. This way is working for me so far. The build quality is all plastic but seems strong and unlike others who complained about the handle grips, I find I like them bc the indentations in the handles allow proper alignment of my fingers and hands. So buy an ab wheel, take it slow at first, then work your way up as u get stronger &ndash; it will work more than core but also your chest, shoulders, tris, lats, and I even felt the muscles in my hands working. One complaint I have is the listing price of over 15 bucks is too high (I think I paid $10.00 4 years ago) for a hunk of plastic and I don&rsquo;t know what makes this any better than similar although cheaper ab wheels out there.</p>

<h5 id="great-workout-at-a-great-price">Great Workout at a Great Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have come across many reputable sources stating that the Ab Wheel is one of the greatest exercise inventions of all time. Not only is the ab wheel effective but it is very cost effective. The first couple of times using the ab wheel I didn&rsquo;t notice much of a burn in the abdominal area but I did feel it in my back. I believe that was due to the slight learning curve that comes with the slightly unnatural movement. Not to mention, the back half of my core isn&rsquo;t very strong as I rarely remember to work it out.After watching some helpful YouTube videos on the Ab Wheel, I learned the proper form and some exercise variations that stepped my Ab Wheel game up. The biggest tip I learned through these videos was to begin tightening your abs with a slight bend in the back at the starting position. Continue this throughout the entire exercise for a proper rep. As soon as I started doing this I instantly felt the burn and would have sore abs for 1-2 days after a 4 or 5 set workout (15 reps per).After using the Ab Wheel I haven&rsquo;t received those 6-pack abs yet (they&rsquo;re just hiding I think) but I do feel much stronger and am able to gains in the Ab Wheel week after week - whether it be additional reps or an ability to roll farther out. I don&rsquo;t have a strict Ab Wheel schedule but hit it whenever I see it. I always leave it by my bed for this reason and try to roll out 15X in both the morning and night.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-little-ab-shredder">Awesome little ab shredder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this ab wheel to add to my daily rotation of exercises. I have been using this product twice a day for the last 4 months.Pros:-Durability, even after extensive use, there is no structural or aesthetic damage to the ab wheel-Function, it was easy to assemble and rolls smoothly day in and day outCons:-Comfort, after using the product for a week, my hands developed small blisters that I am guessing are from the hand grips. They are plastic and can cause discomfort with extended use. I simply wrapped the hand grips in some tape and have not had any issues since.Overall:I am extremely pleased with this product, especially given the relatively low price point. It has lasted daily use for 4 months with no signs of breaking anytime soon. I could not have been happier with this purchase.</p>

<h5 id="decent-ab-wheel">Decent Ab Wheel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a decent ab wheel. Made of pretty solid plastic with a hollow bar as the axle. The handles seem to be hard plastic as well, which start to hurt the hands a bit. I would prefer some sort of coating around them to make it a more pleasurable experience. I also feel that the handles are too close together and it would be more comfortable with a 3rd wheel worth of spacing. Stability is pretty good. There is no spring assistance, which is what I was looking for, but after using it I think I should have because I&rsquo;m not strong enough to fully extend.I can feel the wheel working my lower abs extremely well. Much better than the same amount of sit-ups. Upper-abs, not so much, which could be because I can&rsquo;t fully extend yet. If I were in the market for a new Ab Wheel, I would spend the extra money and get a higher quality one next time.</p>

<p>Got the ab wheel today and assembled it easily. Noticed some lines around one side of the wheel and didn&rsquo;t know what it was. The large piece fell off after the second rotation!Still functional but quality not the best.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-make-sure-your-posture-is-correct">Good product, make sure your posture is correct</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little wheel really gives your core a workout. My advice for first timers would be to watch a video online on how to do it properly. There are many ways you can do it wrong and get little to no benefit.The wheel itself is strong and the wheels move freely and smoothly. The handles are nice and give a good grip, and the jump rope included is a nice touch. This is one of the best things you can use to really get your core into shape if you do it correctly.</p>
