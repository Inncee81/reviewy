<h5 id="some-people-will-never-be-happy">Some people will never be happy&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I am writing this based off the fact that I read the other reviews and at this time I feel are unverified buyers.. first off I called kitchenaid directly and they have heard of this product and verified that this is indeed a kitchenaid mixer that they make and aside from minor trim variations they assured me this is essentially the same exact model of the KP26M1ER with the same warranty and accessory compatibility. This model has the same motor and is made from the same materials but is an Amazon exclusive model number. For the record this is not the only retail exclusive model they make, in fact the representative had a pretty extensive list of the exact same model with retailer specific model numbers. I am NOT a verified buyer, just someone that did a little research. If I do decide to buy this I will post back with my user opinion, but for now&hellip; at least you know this is an actual kitchenaid product with similar specs and same warranty.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="speculative-product-reviews">Speculative product reviews</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some information to combat the sudden influx of negative reviews:0. This mixer, the KL, is identical to the KP, except for the bowl lift rod. (KL: W10598835, KP: 9706787) The W10598835 is a replacement part for the 9706787.1. I called and asked to confirm a comment from /r/cooking. Yep, rep says it&rsquo;s just an alternate model number.2. The model number is likely different here so that a Cyber Monday sale doesn&rsquo;t devalue the product, so that KitchenAid can track units that were used in Amazon&rsquo;s sale, or because the accessories included differ slightly from other models (look around on Amazon, you&rsquo;ll see this last is quite common.)3. It does seem rather unlikely KitchenAid changed their entire manufacturing line to help Amazon scam people during their most highly-publicized sale of the year; it would tank their reviews and brand-name credibility.4. I purchased one of these about 3 years ago. My grandmother got a new one 20 years ago and gave my father her 50(?) years old machine. All three stand mixers are still kicking, and I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but rave reviews from people who&rsquo;ve noticed mine out on the counter. I bought two more during this sale, because after 3 generations of success, I&rsquo;d need irrefutable proof the brand was no longer standing by its products to ignore this deal&ndash;especially when I know the item to be well worth its typical ticket price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-but-raves-so-far">Nothing but raves, so far!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It arrived in when expected, good shape, well-packaged, in KitchenAid box. I&rsquo;ve used it once, made bread, it is amazing! I did clean the bowl and accessories with warm, soapy water before I used it, also wiped the stand thoroughly. There was a gray, greasy film on the inside of the bowl, which was easily removed with dish detergent and baking soda. Since my old hands cannot knead the dough like they used to, this is a purchase that I am sure will be well worth the money!</p>

<h5 id="professional-series-vs-artisan-series">Professional Series vs Artisan Series</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the KitchenAid KSM150PSOB Artisan Series 5-Qt. Stand Mixer with Pouring Shield - Onyx Black for 9 years. I purchased it here on Amazon for a good price and it still works great after using it on average about once a week. So my review is more a comparison review for anyone looking at either purchasing their first one or considering upgrading to a larger mixer.KitchenAid Artisan-*Current Sold by Amazon Price - $279*Included Attachments - Flat beater, dough hook, 6-wire whip and 1-piece pouring shield*Color choice - 30+*Bowl Capacity (Quarts) - 5*Bread Yield (Loaves) - 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>*Cookie Yield (Dozens) - 9*Mash Potato Yield (Pounds) - 7*Wattage - 325*Mixing Speeds - 10*Bowl Finish - Polished Stainless Steel*Bowl Handle - Comfort HandleKitchenAid Professional:*Current Sold by Amazon Price for Empire Red - $549*Included Attachments - Powerknead spiral dough hook, flat beater, and stainless steel wire whip*Color choice - 3*Bowl Capacity (Quarts) - 6*Bread Yield (Loaves) - 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>*Cookie Yield (Dozens) - 13*Mash Potato Yield (Pounds) - 8*Wattage - 575*Mixing Speeds - 10*Bowl Finish - Polished Stainless Steel*Bowl Handle - Comfort HandleAs you can see its size and power that are the main difference between these two. For 9 years I can say that as an average home baker the Artisan has been enough; I can only remember a few times that I had to split up a batch of cookies or felt concerned that there wasn&rsquo;t enough power to mix a stiff dough. Beyond that it has been great and I still think it was one of my best purchases here.I think what it comes down to for anyone looking at buying is: Do you really need the extra capacity and power and are you okay with limited colors. For me although I am happy to have the Professional Series and will gift my Artisan to a family member, if I were looking to buy now I&rsquo;d still stick with the Artisan as several things in my opinion make it better for the average home. First being the size; its much easier to store the Artisan because of the height. Second the colors: I originally chose black because it went with our kitchen decor, red not so much, but with the Artisan you have dozens of colors to pick from. Third is the price and the included attachments; yes you may be able to find the Professional at a lower price than what is currently listed, but it doesn&rsquo;t include the pouring shield which if you want will be an extra $20 (KitchenAid KN256PS 1-Piece Pouring Shield -Only Fits Bowl-Lift models KV25G and KP26M1X).Overall I do think the Professional Series is great mixer and easily give it 5 Stars based on its use and if when compared to the Artisan you feel the additional power and capacity are something you need I don&rsquo;t think you be disappointed!</p>

<h5 id="i-do-love-it-and-use-it-often">I do love it and use it often</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a Kitchenaid mixer before so I&rsquo;m still in the honeymoon phase. I do love it and use it often.I purchased this one because it cost the same as the smaller version but has metal gears in the drive so that made more sense to me. It&rsquo;s BIG, but it fits on my countertop under my cabinets just fine.Once I figured it out, I have no problem attaching/detaching the bowl, the &ldquo;catch&rdquo; is easy to use, just requires a bit more pressure than some and I think that&rsquo;s a good thing since this machine has power!So far, I&rsquo;ve only made some low-carb bread, biscuits, and muffins, and I love being able to use both of my hands to measure and add ingredients.It&rsquo;s super easy to clean all with soapy water- I just fill the mixing bowl and wash the mixer attachments and then the bowl.I really love the color of this too.Now to get the scraping mixer blade.</p>
