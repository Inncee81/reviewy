<h5 id="missing-information-about-keeping-pic-clean">Missing information about keeping pic clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this Waterpik for 2 years with no complaints and it worked great! Little did I know that somewhere in that 2 year period the waterpik started gathering black mold/gunk inside the hose and handle. One day the pik end came off (I hadn&rsquo;t pushed it on enough) and it started squirting black stuff out. I tried cleaning it but ultimately had to take it apart (with no hope of getting it back together as it does break when taking apart) and I was aghast at the unbelievable amount of black gunk inside. It was actually packed with it. I have since seen on line a way to keep it from forming and I will buy this Waterpik again, as I had to throw the other one out. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good waterpik at a very reasonable price, but only if you go online and see the maintenance needed to keep the gunk from forming inside the pik. This company should make these instructions a necessary part of the packaging for this waterpic. I have only given 3 stars because of that, otherwise I would have given at least 4. I hope this helps others with this problem.</p>

<h5 id="using-this-gentle-water-flosser-gave-me-a-very-very-healthy-dental-checkup-my-very-detailed-review">Using this Gentle Water Flosser gave me a very, very healthy dental checkup! My Very Detailed Review.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I am an adult with sensitive gums. Before I purchased this Kids Waterpik, I tried 3 other Waterflossers and ALL were too strong for me. Then I tried this one&hellip;.BINGO! Perfect and so gentle for my gums and teeth.**** Update on August 17, 2016&hellip;I have used this Kids Waterpik since January 2016. After two recent cleanings, both my hygienist and Dentist were totally amazed at how healthy my gums and teeth are. I had pockets of 1&rsquo;s, 2&rsquo;s and just a couple of 3&rsquo;s on my rear molars (I used to have 3&rsquo;s and mostly 4&rsquo;s). This was my best checkup ever in my life! I add just a touch of good quality mouthwash and pure spring water to this and water floss twice daily or more if I eat say popcorn, I also brush 3 times daily. My mouth feels so clean and my teeth are whiter now. My gums are a very healthy pink now!PROS:1 Levels of jet&hellip;it ranges from very soft gentle to medium soft. I tried each and worked up to the highest level which super cleans my gums and teeth WITHOUT IRRITATIIN OR DISCOMFORT.2 Water capacity&hellip;One full tank if this cleaned my gums and teeth in just one try. I did nit need to refill.3 Extra abilities&hellip;I place 1 to 2 caps of Listerine. And many timrs ACT Rinse to remove plaque.4 Turning on and off&hellip;Because this is very close to my sink it is easy to turn off on.5 Takes up just a tiny space&hellip;I placed mine right next to my sink and it fits well.6 Suggestion&hellip;A large Ziplock bag covers the whole waterflosser and the pik tip. I have attempted to show a picture.Also, I found when I waterfloss to hold my head downward and mouth mostly closed while waterflossing and then there is no mess (water does not go all over bathroom).</p>

<h5 id="what-a-blast">What a blast!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just used this thing, and full blast is REALLY full blast! I&rsquo;m not sure a kid could handle it. I&rsquo;ll probably use it at a 2.5 rather than a 3 setting. It was a great price and small, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try rather than buy the adult version after reading several reviews for this model. My first try was hilarious. I had water going onto my glasses and the bathroom mirror. Oops. I gave it a go again, knowing what to expect, and a piece of popcorn hull (is that what it&rsquo;s called?) came out. I thought I&rsquo;d flossed well between now, Thursday, and Tuesday, when I had the popcorn. So it&rsquo;s kinda gross that the waterpik shot that last piece out of my teeth 2 days later. That makes me think this is the way to go. I hope it holds up. Amazon had it at a better price than WalMart at the date of my purchase, and I had 2 extra piks delivered as well since I&rsquo;ll be sharing with hubby and one kid.</p>

<h5 id="better-for-you-than-flossing-kids-think-it-s-fun-so-they-do-it-more">Better for you than flossing &amp; kids think it&rsquo;s fun so they do it more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used a waterpik for years as a kid and I remember thinking it was great then. I had braces and nothing cleared junk out of my teeth/braces better than my waterpik. At some point as I grew older it fell by the wayside and I forgot all about them until our dentist recommended it over flossing. He states that flossing can drag the crud and bacteria deeper into the gums if not done properly (with a new section of floss for each tooth and not going back down after going up). He also states that his patients who use a waterpik have consistently healthier teeth, gums and mouth in general than his hard-core flossers.We bought the adult waterpik for ourselves Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser and this one for our almost 8 year old girl. We all love them! Our daughter is much better about doing her teeth now that she has her waterpik because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. Plus her teeth/gums end up way cleaner than when she was trying to do floss and brush before.In hindsight, I would buy this unit for myself as well over the adult unit. The reason being is that it is smaller and doesn&rsquo;t take up as much room on the counter. In addition, it doesn&rsquo;t have a lid with a compartment in it for a bunch of useless attachments (as the adult one does). The problem with that lid is it can be a hassle to get on and off because it can pop open. Also, I like the color better. It comes with stickers which, obviously, you don&rsquo;t have to use, so it doesn&rsquo;t look like a kids unit otherwise.The one issue we&rsquo;ve had with our daughter is that she has a hard time pressing the water chamber down tight enough on the unit for it to seal. We solved this by keeping a little plastic cup in the bathroom and so she just fills the cup with water then pours it into the water chamber as needed (and this is fun also apparently&hellip;)Summary: Great unit, better for your teeth than flossing, fun for kids to use so increases compliance, and smaller footprint than the blue adult one.</p>

<h5 id="dual-voltage-travel-size-works-great-for-kids-and-adults">Dual voltage, travel size, works great for kids and adults</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were looking for a waterflosser that we could travel with and a friend told us about this model. It is not advertised as dual voltage, but it works in both the UK and AU/NZ with an adapter. The difference between this model and the full flosser is that it only goes to a strength of three &ndash; more than enough for both my wife and me. Just leave the stickers off and you wouldn&rsquo;t know that this is a child&rsquo;s model. Or put them on and tell the world to f-off because you&rsquo;re an adult and if you want to put cool stickers on your stuff, you&rsquo;ll do just that.</p>

<h5 id="bad-idea-by-young-mba-at-waterpik">Bad idea by young MBA at Waterpik</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a joke. If they thought they were going to cultivate young users, they blew it. This is a crude travel unit ( with stickers) Waterpik gives out in a set with a full size&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a small counter so I got this kids version. The only &ldquo;button&rdquo; on the hand held wand part is to release the tip, if you want to turn it off/on even just for a pause&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="mold-after-2-months-of-use">Mold after 2 months of use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works great for my 10 year old - much easier than flossing, especially with braces. BUT after only 2 months of use, I just discovered there is black mold growing in the handle.</p>

<h5 id="wish-it-had-an-extra-button">Wish it had an extra button.</h5>

<p>Bought this product for my eight year old. It&rsquo;s easy to fill with water and easy to change the heads.</p>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-money-better-ones-out-there">Not worth the money. Better ones out there</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This does not have a on off switch. Which made it a huge mess to use. Your suppose to start using it in mouth. But unless you want to swallow the water you have to spit it out.</p>
