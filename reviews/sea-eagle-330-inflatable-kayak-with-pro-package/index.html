It weighs just 26 pounds, but will carry 500 pounds. It&rsquo;s inflated dimension are 11&rsquo;2&rdquo; x 2&rsquo;10&rdquo; Between it&rsquo;s 9&rdquo; tubes is a 9&rsquo;6&rdquo; x 1&rsquo;1&rdquo; interior.

Imagine blasting down a white water river&ndash;with spray flying everywhere and your heart beating like a drum&ndash;or silently paddling down a mirror-smooth lake at dawn. A pleasant dream? Definitely, but also a slice of attainable reality with the Sea Eagle 330 inflatable kayak. Designed to hold up to 500 pounds but weighing only 26 pounds itself, the 330 can up to two adults and gear, but only needs one adult to carry it to the water. It&rsquo;s even tough enough to withstand dog claws thanks to the 33 mm polykrylar hull, I-beam construction, and high-frequency welded seams. Your four-legged friend can therefore stand tall while you do all the work.</p>

<p>The Sea Eagle 330 canoe packs down to fit in a storage bag, yet has enough cargo space for several days worth of camping supplies. And it&rsquo;s versatile enough for plenty of uses, from fishing to yacht tending to skin-diving. It can even handle up to Class III whitewater. Other details include inflatable spray skirts, front and rear rope handles, and a self-bailing drain valve (a handy feature on whitewater rivers or ocean surf). This pro version of the Sea Eagle 330 also comes with two 8-foot AB30 paddles, two kayak seats, a foot pump, and a storage bag. The kayak measures 134 inches long and 34 inches wide and carries a three-year warranty.</p>

<h5 id="good-boat-but-with-a-few-drawbacks">Good boat, but with a few drawbacks.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just took mine out for its maiden voyage yesterday at the beach. From my apartment its about a 15 minute walk, so I figured I&rsquo;d throw it over my back and walk with it. This is the biggest problem of the kayak: it&rsquo;s quite heavy. The product page lists the boat at 26 pounds, which is just not true. Even with only one of the seats and one of the paddles you&rsquo;re carrying around 40-50 pounds of weight. The included bag is pretty thick, but estimating with my home scale say the boat itself weighs in the neighborhood of 35 pounds. The fact that it is so much heavier than I was expecting is a problem for me, because I was hoping to carry it out there most weekends, which I&rsquo;ll have to rethink.Once I got to the beach, though, it was a cinch to set up. Granted, I had done the initial set-up at home, installing the boston valves, etc. But those valves make it very easy to inflate, and the included pump is more than up to the task. It probably took around 10 minutes to get it ready, and then my dog hopped in and we went into the water. Despite a windy day and high ( up to around 4 ft) waves near the shore, this boat really handled it well, and I believe the claim that it can handle class III rapids. While I didn&rsquo;t have the drain valve open, and took on a fair amount of water, we were still more than bouyant enough to stay comfortably afloat. Had a great time paddling around out past the waves, and it was very comfortable with me (6&rsquo;3&rdquo;, 200 lbs) and my dog (~22 lbs, corgi mix) but I have a hard time believing that you could comfortably have two adults in this boat. Also, while perfectly servicable, I wasn&rsquo;t impressed by the included paddles. They get the job done, and don&rsquo;t feel flimsy, but the connections aren&rsquo;t very tight, which leads to a bit of play at the center connection. This means you lose a bit of energy in every stroke to bending the paddle. It&rsquo;s not much of an issue for short outings or in flat water, but that kind of innefficiency would bother me on rapids or if I were out for more than an hour or two.Overall, it&rsquo;s a good boat, that loses points for the weight, paddles, and overpromising on capacity. I&rsquo;d recommend it if you don&rsquo;t need to carry it more than a few hundred feet to the water, and I&rsquo;d recommend saving yourself some money and getting the pro solo package, as the second seat is going to go to waste anyway. As others have said, get the 370 if you want to do tandem rowing.</p>

<h5 id="best-value">Best Value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome buy! Can&rsquo;t beat it for the price. It has worked better than expected, especially as a first timer. Have even had a few times stuck in brush, rubbed on rocks, etc., and never an issue, even dragged it on rocky beach.It&rsquo;s about 85 pumps for the floor, and 90 for each of the other 2 main chambers. We are 2 people, and tjis inflation pressure is great all day, no loss of air as of yet, even using it 2 days in a row camping. We&rsquo;ve paddled over 50miles in it so far, down river, and it does well in class 2 rapids, class 3 is doable as well.</p>

<h5 id="overall-i-am-glad-that-i-bought-this-kayak">Overall I am glad that I bought this kayak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall I am glad that I bought this kayak. I&rsquo;ll go through the negatives before I describe what I really like about it. The first thing I noticed about the kayak is that it is very heavy. When packed up in the very sturdy shoulder bag, with the bare minimum of equipment, it weighs ~40 lbs. The strap of the bag will dig pretty deep into your shoulder if you need to carry it any distance. I&rsquo;ve been transporting it in an old Bob stroller. Also, as has been said in other reviews, the placement of the inflation valves is pretty inconvenient. There is always a bit of a wresting match between me and the kayak to get the pump nozzle into the valves. Speaking of the valves, the very well designed valves come detached from the kayak and need to be affixed by you. This is a very irritating step that could have been done at the factory. My experience was especially irritating as one of the nozzle lips (the most difficult to access) also happened to have excess material around it that prevented the nozzle slip-ring from seating properly. I had to trim the fabric back with a razor blade. It worked, but there was a lot of swearing involved in the process. Those are the negatives. The positives are pretty strong however. The kayak is very well made and sturdy. I can get it out of the bag and get it ready to go in under 10 minutes by myself. It paddles pretty well for an inflatable. The skegs on mine are slightly bent, but I have not found it bad enough to warrant realigning them (as described in the accompanying documentation, with a hair dryer). I have no trouble going straight or turning smoothly. It&rsquo;s also very comfortable to paddle and ride in. The pro package seat is a bit too high for me (gives it too-high a center of mass, I am fairly tall), so I only fill it up 50% or so, works fine. The interior is plenty big for two adults, or one adult and two children. Breakdown and clean-up are super easy. The kayak was not perfect coming out of the box and is heavier that I expected, but I really enjoy using it and with proper care I expect it will last many years.</p>

<h5 id="far-exceeded-my-expectations">Far exceeded my expectations!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I ordered this product, I tried to temper my enthusiasm as I was unsure of what I was getting myself into ordering an inflatable kayak. I was really hoping that I wasn&rsquo;t about to receive a glorified pool raft. Boy was I wrong! This kayak has far exceeded my expectations! It arrived well packaged in a relatively small box considering what was inside. I opened the package in the backyard and prepared to inflate it for the first time. The o-rings (9 in total) were a little tough to get on since they are made of a hard plastic, but that really is a good thing since once they are on, they are meant to be on for good. Once I had those set up, installing the one-way air valves is a snap. I can inflate my kayak and 2 premium seats in well under 10 minutes. The foot pump comes with a deflation port, but for me this isn&rsquo;t really necessary. When it is time to deflate, simply unscrewing the air valves pushes out 90% of the air in around 60 seconds. The remainder of the air is forced out when I roll it up. I&rsquo;ve taken it out on the water three times already and it is great. While it does advertise that it seats 2, my opinion is that it depends on the height of those 2 people. I am 5&rsquo;8 and with my 10 year old, or my 5&rsquo;1 wife, its no problem at all. But if you try to get in with 2 people who are each around 5&rsquo;8&rdquo; or taller, it gets tight pretty quick. May want to upgrade to the Sea Eagle 370. Overall it is an absolutely fantastic product for the money!</p>
