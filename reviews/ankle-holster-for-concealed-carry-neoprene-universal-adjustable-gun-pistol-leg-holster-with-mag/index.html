<h5 id="a-very-solid-seller-who-backs-his-product-2nd-update">A very solid Seller who backs his product &hellip; 2nd Update &hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>2nd UPDATE- after starting the return process (couldn&rsquo;t find the &ldquo;replace&rdquo; option in &ldquo;return/replace&rdquo; page), I was very quickly contacted by the seller offering to make it right immediately. Since I had already initiated the return, he immediately refunded my credit card back $18.95 and already has the replacement on the way at no additional charge. That, is a solid seller and one I will continue to do business with. I think some of the bad reviews here may be from other sellers, and I did notice that most of these reviews are from verified buyers while some similar items reviews, while &ldquo;glowing&rdquo;, have less verified buyer percentages, and one has &ldquo;zero&rdquo; certified buyer reviews.I will definitely do business with DPA Ventures in the future in complete confidence. Note&hellip; this item is black, and not FDE as in the top photo.To see how quickly this happened, and was resolved, go to the first review at the bottom, then the &ldquo;update&rdquo; below. I&rsquo;m looking forward to putting this holster to very good use. Reviews are separated by paragraphs &hellip;&hellip;.Update &hellip; From 5 stars to 1 &hellip;. was really happy when I got it and put it on today. Wore it around for about 4 hours, then when I did a &ldquo;test&rdquo; release / draw, the &ldquo;strong Velcro hammer strap&rdquo; almost came completely off &hellip;. it&rsquo;s held on by 2 threads. I came back and went through the reviews, and prior to the last 7 days, it was all 5 stars, in the last 5 days, it&rsquo;s all 1 star, so it could just be a bad lot, or, I just happened to get a bad one, or there are some phony bad reviews from the competition/unverified buyers.Really like this Holster &hellip;. fits my LCRx nice and snug, very little movement while walking, and very comfortable.Considered other similar items for $5 to $8 less that had as good or better reviews, but decided to pay the extra for the lifetime warranty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holster is very comfortable, has great adjustment from small to larger ankles. Have some concern that in the heat of summer will sweat badly under the neoprene. But, so far, no problem and I would recommend it as it appears to be well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-holster-as-a-backup-option">A great holster as a backup option.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My M&amp;P Shield fits as snug as a bug in a rug. The spare magazine also fits nicely; but I find it can be cumbersome to remove - especially in a SHTF situation. The holster does snugly fit my leg. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to barely notice I was wearing it. However, there are three things that could be improved.One, some type of covering for the inner portion of the holster. Sheepskin, or something along those lines. It would increase the comfort level dramatically.Two, although my M&amp;P Shield is a smaller gun, it takes some effort to draw it from the holster. Granted, the holster IS new, so perhaps after breaking it in, that can improve. I will say, however, that the strap which holds the gun in the holster fits nicely. Again, I think this is just an issue of using the holster for a time until it breaks in.Three, I have noticed that my gun has printing issues. Although I think that may be due to just proper positioning while wearing the holster. Possibly getting proper pants might help with that, as well. If you&rsquo;re not looking for it, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t notice. But if you are looking for it, you might notice it.Overall, I think this would be a great choice of holsters if it is a backup option. And a better than decent choice if this happens to be a primary option.</p>

<h5 id="by-far-the-best-ankle-holster-purchase-i-ve-ever-made-and-you-should-too">By far the best ankle holster purchase I&rsquo;ve ever made! And you should too!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>By far this is the best ankle holster purchase I&rsquo;ve ever made, and I&rsquo;ve made many holster purchases before. Unlike other brand ankle holsters that tend to fail and become uncomfortable after a few uses, &ldquo;DPA Ventures&rdquo; ankle holster is made with extreme high quality material and build. And the extra clip holder it has is a big PLUS for me as well. It&rsquo;s really low profile too.I can wear my &ldquo; DPA Ventures&rdquo; ankle holster for days or even months on end. It&rsquo;s extremely versatile, comfortable, and durable. I never have to worry about about it coming undone or deteriorating. It always stays put, no matter the situation I&rsquo;m in, unlike other brands.My friends ask me where i get my ankle holster from and I tell them I get it from &ldquo;DPA Ventures&rdquo;. Once they purchase it, they&rsquo;re always telling me how comfortable it feels feels and how great it is.On a scale of 1-10 how great is this product? 11. I highly recommend you buy from &ldquo;DPA Ventures&rdquo;. It&rsquo;ll be the best purchase you make.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-reccomend-the-only-holster-ill-ever-buy">HIGHLY RECCOMEND! THE ONLY HOLSTER ILL EVER BUY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very durable and extremely comfortable holster. It feels like there&rsquo;s nothing there, no itch, no discomfort. I&rsquo;ve never felt anything as comfortable as this holster and I&rsquo;ll be buying plenty for all my friends for their birthdays. There&rsquo;s no way what the bad reviews are saying because I&rsquo;ve tried plenty of other brands and this FAR EXCEEDS expectations. For this product Id gladly pay $40+.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-no-blood-flow-cutoff">Very nice&hellip;no blood flow cutoff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The gun pouch could be a little larger and would be a perfect ankle holster. Very comfortable with a Ruger LCP. But a Glock 43 is a bit too thick for the pouch and it digs into one&rsquo;s leg because the pouch is so tight. Otherwise a 5 star! I&rsquo;m sure it will be a favorite holster but have to be a bit more selective about what is carried&hellip;won&rsquo;t be 1911 or a Block 36&hellip;but it might be reason enough to get the LCP II and or Glock 42.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="holster-two-thumbs-up">Holster: Two thumbs UP</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A1 Product. Material very comfortable. Neoprene stretches without pulling on skin. Piece holsters up quite securely after a day of walking around. Material is breathable, leg not sweaty. Straight line stitched, in other words HIGH quality manufacturing. Attention to detail in the construction. &ldquo;Next Gen&rdquo; micro Velcro grab hooks hold back straps firm without discomfort or chaffing. Excellent product!Compared to the crap I&rsquo;ve purchased elsewhere, this Item is well vetted. Would buy again from DPA Ventures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I was expecting.. Great product..</p>

<h5 id="my-new-favorite-ankle-holster">My New Favorite Ankle Holster</h5>

<p>As soon as I got the holster I wore it all day the next day. I didn&rsquo;t have any issues with discomfort, and it&rsquo;s made of great quality materials.</p>
