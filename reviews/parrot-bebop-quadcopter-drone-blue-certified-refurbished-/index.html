<h5 id="blue-bebop-refurbished">Blue Bebop - Refurbished</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used one of these before and was pretty set on getting a Bebop. With the release of the Bebop 2, I was looking to get one a bit cheaper. I grabbed this refurbished unit during a Lightening Deal on Amazon, and have been very pleased.The drone speaks for itself, and is a pretty big jump over most of the toy level models that are available. The camera, app, brushless motors, and GPS are among the many features that make it a good choice for the money.I was a bit nervous about the refurbished drone, but Amazon seems to be careful about selling refurbished items and they have never disappointed me in the past. This came with all of the expected accessories, and the batteries seem to be holding charge as expected. Aside from the packaging, this looks like a new unit.I would have really liked to have gotten a Skycontroller too, but it seems awfully expensive for what it is. I have been using this with a Samsung Galaxy S5 and a generic PS3 controller and it controls very well and with no noticeable lag. I haven&rsquo;t pushed the range, but I have no intention in ever flying this thing 2km away.If you are interested in a drone and can get this for under $200, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. Expect to get a controller of some sort though. It can be flown with the app on a touch screen, but it is quite difficult and no fun at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good price. Good drone. Good customer service.Bebop is a great drone, and for this price, it was irresistible. The batteries mine shipped with were no good, but they shipped new ones to me immediately. The important part, the drone itself, worked perfectly. Installed new firmware, and flies fine. I use phone and controller combo, but it connects to skycontroller with no issues.These come with 1200mAh batteries. If you want to do more than a few minutes of flying (you do), just resign yourself to purchasing a couple of aftermarket batteries. Read up on the care and feeding of LiPo batteries. Will save you tons of cash for 5 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="refurb-is-not-quality">Refurb is NOT QUALITY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have done well with refurbished computers and cameras, and I find drones are not the same. Unit was dirty went received, you could see some wear. Loose wire from the battery compartment. Battery connect was not fixed, moved so that the battery could not be attached without serious playing with it. Not good. I would not trust this provider for refurbished. Not done well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tech-union-stands-beside-their-warranty-great-deal-worth-the-price-will-buy-again">Tech Union stands beside their warranty. Great deal, worth the price. Will buy again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This drone is awesome! I have had amazing video from the start. I did have issues with the barometer on the first drone, but realized the risk when buying a refurbished model. Tech Union sent me another drone within days. I had more issues with the power button. Even though the bebop was obviously beat up from me learning to fly it, Tech Union fixed the drone, when they could have easily denied the warranty. This company stands beside their product. I am now flying like a mad pilot. Do not attempt to fly this drone without learning about it. You will break it if you don&rsquo;t learn how to fly it. Most of the bad reviews are user error. I highly recommend buying the sky controller because phones and tablets have a tendency to freeze up. Freeze up=Wrecked Bebop. The only crashes I had were do to tablet/phone freezing. The sky controller takes it to a whole new level.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thank-you-amazon">thank you Amazon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great no problems. I do recommend tech Union for a purchase of a refurbished bebopMine was delivered fast. Charger works fine. Batteries charge up fine. The bebop flies remarkably accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the Bebop. I&rsquo;ve had 4 of them all told. This refirb flies smoother than the others. Great hobby drone. Be sure the little dart icon is green before taking off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-flew-great-on-the-first-day">It flew great on the first day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It flew great on the first day, didn&rsquo;t work at all day 2. Based on other reviews, I&rsquo;d agree that it is likely battery contact is off. Otherwise, it was a great day 1!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fire">Fire!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Damn battery started to smoke and leak all over my leathers seats. Almost caught fire with my kids in the car. Amazon refunded me fully. Just be careful</p>
