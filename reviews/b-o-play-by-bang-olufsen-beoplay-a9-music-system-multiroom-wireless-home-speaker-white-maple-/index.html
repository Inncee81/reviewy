<p>Color:White with Maple Legs
The innovative Beoplay A9 wireless music system is a powerhouse of style and substance. This impressive wireless speaker features a hefty 480-watt digital Class D amplifier system with separate amps for each of its five built-in speaker units. It fills even the most spacious of rooms with authentic Bang &amp; Olufsen Signature Sound so you can experience honest, clean music the way the artists intend you to hear it.</p>

<p>Easily connect using AirPlay, Google Cast, DLNA or Bluetooth 4.0 and start playing your music in seconds. With built-in streaming services, you’ll have access to millions of songs, radio stations and curated playlists at your fingertips through streaming services such as Spotify, Deezer and TuneIn.</p>

<p>An intuitive touch interface on the speaker keeps you in control of the music with a simple swipe of your hand or tap of your finger. Start, stop, adjust volume or switch tracks with ease. The BeoMusic App on your tablet or smartphone offers another way to take control, and your sound system will automatically update with new features and services when it’s online.</p>

<p>Designed and crafted like a sleek piece of contemporary furniture, the A9 wireless speaker is made with carefully selected premium materials and keen attention to detail. Even when you aren’t listening to music, the A9 makes a beautiful addition to your home décor. Unlike stereos in the past, you’ll want to display the Beoplay A9 in plain sight. The versatile design includes exchangeable Kvadrat front covers and two choices of leg finishes so you can customize your speaker to best suit your style and your space. Remove the legs completely and hang your A9 from its wall bracket for a space-saving option.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-vinyl-records-too">Great for vinyl records too!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Setup was easy. Rich, clean, and crisp sound. I listen to mostly vinyl and this is the best overall quality I&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed for my vinyl. I have also used the A9 to listen to music from my iPhone. The sound is unbelievable, though I did experience a dropped Bluetooth connection when my phone was in a different room than the A9.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-sound-is-great-but-the-connectivity-is-lacking">The sound is great but the connectivity is lacking.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound is wonderful but the bluetooth delay is terrible. I realize they want you to accept that they dont make the bluetooth standard, they just adhere to it, but to me if you cant synch audio and video - its useless for video. Something that represents a significant investment considering should be better. I tried wifi and apple play and had no success with either. In fact - I had to call the b&amp;o help desk - something i find a considerable negative, and did not get any relief. They pushed me back to apple.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-sound-but-glitchy-bluetooth-frustration">FANTASTIC sound but glitchy Bluetooth = Frustration.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE TO REVIEW: Had to knock it to THREE stars as it has been a lesson in frustration. The bluetooth functionality is AWFUL. After i disconnected and tried to reconnect it would take about 20-30 minutes of re-setting the A9, unplugging it, trying over and over. For no rhyme or reason it would hook up and most of the time it wouldn&rsquo;t. Tried my iPhone 6+, iMac, and other devices. ALL glitchy. Then when I switched to airplay the volume dropped to half even though I had it to &ldquo;max&rdquo; in the Beo Setup App.It gets so frustrating I give up and listen to the Beloit 15 instead because I can not get hooked up to the A9II. When it works, the sound is AMAZING. I am returning this and will buy a replacement locally at the B&amp;O store, this way if there are issues I do not have to SHIP it back for a refund. I am hoping it is an issue with THIS unit, but not so sure. I own the A2 and Beloit 15 and those are rock solid. Not sure why their flagship Beoplay product is so glitchy with bluetooth.&mdash;original review:Holy Moly. This A9 MkII is not only the most gorgeous Audio device I have ever seen, used or owned, it sounds just as good as it looks. BEAUTIFUL does not even start to describe it as it sits in my living room. After owning the A2, Beloit 15 and H8 Headphones I had to get the A9II. Glad i did. I recently sold off a $30k Audio system and wanted to downsize, big time. After getting this setup (5 min) my room was FILLED with amazing rich gorgeous sound, more so than my $30k system that was all just sold. $2700 and I am happier with this. Unreal.Nothing can beat it for $2700 as an all in one. Nothing. IN looks, build, or performance. It&rsquo;s NOT expensive for what it gives you. For me, it will give me YEARS of music and smiles. Bluetooth is included in the Mark II and thank B&amp;O for doing this.If you want a beautiful music system that will fill even your LARGE house with rich distortion free sound, you MUST see and hear the A9II.</p>

<h5 id="brilliant-look-and-sound">Brilliant look and Sound!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound is amazing!!! Nothing compares to it. AirPlay was easy to set up and haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it, it makes it easier to control if you download the app available for Apple and Android devices. I&rsquo;ve read some reviews where they have issues connecting to it via Bluetooth or Wifi, I&rsquo;ve connected both ways with no issues and no drops either.Is it worth the money?? Absolutely. You def get for what you pay for! I am not disappointed in the slightest. Recently had a party and everyone thought it was a decorative piece&hellip;until the music started playing, everyone&rsquo;s jaw dropped!! It became the center of attention! Is notably unique but you are sure to impress some guest!</p>

<h5 id="this-was-a-massive-disappointment-and-an-even-bigger-frustration">this was a massive disappointment, and an even bigger frustration</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought the second generation Beoplay A9 from the B&amp;O Retailer in Oslo, Norway, in February 2015. After only three days, we got in touch with customer support. Though connecting the device to our wifi was not a problem, we quickly experienced connectivity problems. The problems we experienced were across Bluetooth, Airplay and Spotify Connect. Essentially, we found it impossible to switch from one source to another, and the various applications kept freezing, whilst the music dropped out completely.The only solution we found was to unplug and re-plug the unit in order to reconnect with a streaming source. Needless to say, this was a massive disappointment, and an even bigger frustration. When paying a premium price, one expects a premium product. B&amp;O customer service were very quick to respond, and let us come to their store and pick up a replacement unit. This turned out to be the wrong model, so in the end, an employee from the B&amp;O Retailer came to our house with yet another unit. The person made sure that the stereo was correctly set up, and working.I guess we were hoping that our first unit was somehow faulty, as we loved the sound when it was working, and – of course – the design. Sadly, this has not been the case. On and off over time the unit kept freezing, and we had to unplug and re-plug to get connectivity back. Sometimes it even started playing German digital radio if you hit play by touching the unit. From what we could tell from the Beomusic app, the German feed came from the streaming app TuneIn to which we do not even have access. For those particularly curious, the channel in question was &ldquo;Kulturradio rbb&rdquo;. Moreover, we tried all different frequencies on our wifi, and tried connecting with various iPhone models, iPads, HTC phone, Macs and PCs. Sometimes it worked. A lot of the times it didn’t. In the end we tried with an AUX-cable, and even this did not work.After more than six months with frustration over not being able to just put on some music when we want, we contacted customer service yet again. Thankfully, B&amp;O agreed to refund our purchase in accordance with Norwegian law and our customer rights. We are pleased with their customer service – it has been as expected from a premium retailer. Nevertheless, when the product itself is such a massive disappointment and source of frustration, B&amp;O come in short here. Friends, don’t buy it.</p>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny">Worth Every Penny!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This sound system is worth every penny! Excellent sound! I had no problems with setup as for the sw apps: BeoSetup &amp; BeoMusic no issues with install on my iPhone and iPad. However if experiencing any sw glitches make sure that you download the most current Beo version and enjoy your BIG sound!!!😎</p>
