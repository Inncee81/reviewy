<h5 id="best-picture-quality-i-ve-ever-seen-i-made-the-right-choice-super-slim-can-be-mounted-on-a-stand">Best picture quality I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I made the right choice. Super Slim. Can be mounted on a stand.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had this TV about a week now and i must say it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve ever owned. Before buying i took a trip to Best Buy with the intention of looking at the JS9000 from Samsung. After seeing it (JS9000) i noticed the picture changed dramatically when viewing off center. I then went to see the other televisions to compare and saw the LG&rsquo;s. I instantly noticed a more dramatic and intense picture quality compared to the Samsungs , Sonys etc. Best Buy only had the curved 55 inch eg9600 so i was then sold on that one. I went home did some research and read how the curved 9600&rsquo;s will not support HDR content through HDMI. The curved version only supports viewing HDR content via streaming from the internet. So a UHD 4K Blu-Ray player will not show HDR content on the curved version. However the flat ef9500&rsquo;s do support HDR content through all HDMI ports. Also learned the flat versions are less prone to picture issues like vignetting etc.Once the tv arrived i was more impressed than i thought I&rsquo;d be. Picture quality is amazing. Even when viewing broadcast tv through AT&amp;T uverse i notice a drastic improvement in picture quality due to the upscaling being done by the tv. I did stream some 4k content and was blown away by the clarity contrast and color of the images. 3D also had me staring at the screen in shock. I turned on Avatar 3D Blu Ray and the passive 3d glasses had me moving around when things popped from the screen. Picture quality was just as good in 3D as when watching a normal Blu Ray. Haven&rsquo;t noticed any drastic vignetting on my set but i am watching for it. I received a 510 model built in October.As far as gaming goes i was hesitant to purchase this set at first due to its high input lag but eventually got over it. I played Black Ops 3 on my PS4 to see how bad it really was in online multi player and i must say i noticed no difference at all from my last tv as far as input lag. This TV must be in game mode, if not, games are impossible to play in online multi player. Picture quality from my PS4 was stunning while gaming. Can&rsquo;t wait to play the new Uncharted on this set. Also looking forward to buying a 4k UHD Blu Ray player once they are available to see this TV in all its HDR glory. 4k content is becoming more and more available.Lastly the only gripe i had with this TV was the mounting standard used is not VESA standard so i had to have the LG OTW150 mount to put this TV on a stand with a universal swivel mount (not on the wall). I have included pictures of the back of the tv to demonstrate how the LG mount goes onto the VESA tv stand swivel mount. Got the LG mount for free with the TV so wasn&rsquo;t too big of a deal. And mounting it was simple and fast using m6 screws and m6 nylon lock nuts with washers.Overall impressed with this set. It is future proof and loaded with features. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to purchase if your in the market for a new TV.</p>

<h5 id="4k-oled-tech-that-delivers-on-true-black">4K OLED Tech that delivers on True Black!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked this up at BB when this went on sale for $4999 with free 49&rdquo; 4K TV. Initial impressions are wow!!! The blacks this produce are amazing. Any video enthusiast dreams of a great picture to include the perfect black levels. This one hits it out of the park. The 1st time you watch a wide screen movie and realize that the top and bottom bars are perfectly black (because they are turned off) you realize you are more engaged in the movie instead of watching a movie highlighted by light blue/gray bars. This isn&rsquo;t limited to the black bars, but the entire picture. Watching movies like the recent Batman trilogy, you really start to appreciate the movie that much more than before. No longer do you have choose between crushed blacks or muted blacks. You get what the director intended.I&rsquo;ve also tried 4K content from the TVs built in app: YouTube, Netflix and Amazon. I re-watched the 1st episodes of Marco Polo and Narcos on Netflix in 4K and I couldn&rsquo;t believe how much better it could get over 1080p. You see the in store demos and its all nicely produced stills or time lapses to &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; how great the picture is, but seeing real content in 4K is what makes it worth it.The TV features the latest HDMI 2.0a and HDCP 2.2 specs. You get your HDR support with the 2.0a and you are able to display 4K copy protected materials from external sources (FireTV, Roku4, upcoming 4K Blu-ray players, etc).So enough with pros, what about the cons? Well unfortunately like most TVs there are downsides. The most notable of those are:1.) Vignetting - Essentially the side edges of the screen show darker than the rest of the TV in certain circumstances.2.) &ldquo;Yellow Splotch&rdquo; - Not really a technical name for this, but on some sets (mainly the 65&rdquo;), on the right <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the TV is a section of sepia/yellow tint to the screen. On most viewing its not noticeable. However its rears its ugly head in Black and White films or where Gray or White is prominent on that side of the TV. The root cause of this is unknown, but possibly something to do with the anti-reflection materials used.So would those 2 things keep me away? No. And I have both issues. Find a store that will allow you to return this set as many times as possible until you get a good one. Even with these issues, this has been the best TV I&rsquo;ve had to date and I&rsquo;ve bought a lot. Good luck and start enjoying movies again.</p>

<h5 id="banding-dynamic-false-rending-issue-is-a-problem">banding/dynamic false rending issue is a problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I watch blu ray movies on this television it is every bit as beautiful as anyone has said it is. But if I watch any other content (all HD of course) then I get a banding, posterizing, dynamic false contouring that is really quite annoying and not at all expected in a television of this quality and reputation. I have tried all kinds of setting differences. I can get &lsquo;rid&rsquo; of the problem if I reduce brightness a lot, but then the television is really only good in brightly lit scenes, and that completely negates the &lsquo;true black&rsquo; sales claims of OLED. This problem occurs in dark scenes or dark portions of scenes where the screen is trying to decide how to render color.</p>
