Description the new turtle skin is a fun and functional case that is designed keeping the habits of kids and adults in mind while using their personal devices. The new turtle skin provides the best of form and function for a fraction of the price.

The rounded form fits in your hand perfectly, which also prevent accidental drops. On the other hand, even if it does, the dual protection features of the 6mm thick silicone case and also the corner shock absorber pattern seamlessly protect it from all sorts of shock and impact. The corner patterns can also be used to attach various charms to keep kids entertained. To enhance the efficiency of the device, the inside pattern is raised to create air channels that vent the heat from the device outward. Launched in 4 eye-catching kid friendly colors, its a perfect blend of economy, form and function. Compatibility: Only compatible with the Samsung galaxy tab a 10.1 (2016). Materials premium grade silicone to dull and absorb impact from drops. Easy to clean with a quick rinse and wipe. Product contents 1x Poetic turtle skin case.</p>

<h5 id="great-design-and-easy-to-apply-but">Great design and easy to apply. But&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the simple design and application of this case. However I&rsquo;m concerned about how easy it is for it to come loose while holding it, especially along the long edge (see photo). I&rsquo;ll be testing this in a shop environment and I foresee lots of dust and other nasties getting in there and wreaking havoc. Not to mention it just doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;solid&rdquo; when you hold it like this. I&rsquo;m tempted to try and apply some non-permanent adhesive, like a double-sided gel-type, to make it more snug. Will update if I find something that works well. Would love hear suggestions from other users or the manufacturer on this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-case-can-be-easily-removed-by-pulling-at-the-sides">The case can be easily removed by pulling at the sides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 perfectly. It is not a snug fit though, and is a bit loose but not very loose. The case can be easily removed by pulling at the sides. The sides are protected with the thick design on the sides. I suggest buying a screen protector for your tablet to protect screen. I am happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-very-good-product-at-a-reasonable-price">A very good product at a reasonable price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought my son a new Galaxy and needed a case ASAP. This case is bright so it makes it easy to find the device. Most importantly, it has already saved me a great deal of money by protecting it from several drops. The thick rubber case is very protective. My 7 year old is hard on electronics and this is a very good product at a reasonable price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beefy">Beefy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I try to not buy critical items unless I can assess them with my own two hands, so I was a little leery ordering a case for my Tab A without knowing how durable it was. Well, this case arrived today and after putting the screen protector on (another review) and placing the Tab A in the case, well, I&rsquo;m very impressed.Make no mistake - this is a beefy chunk of durable silicone rubber. The screen-side bezel is a raised lip about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; meaning if it fell face-first it would land on this bezel and protect the screen. The corners - with the &ldquo;crush zone&rdquo; cutouts - is genius. All buttons and port holes line up perfect. Surprisingly, it seems to have added some weight to the overall unit; now when I hold it it has heft and is easier to hold and carry.My biggest concern when I bought the Tab A is that it&rsquo;s thin and slippery - this case gives some traction and something to hold, and now the Tab A won&rsquo;t slide around.Thanks Poetic, This is exactly the case I wanted. Well done!EDIT 12/1/16 - still very happy with the case; as another reviewer mentioned it would be nice if there were &lsquo;stiffeners&rsquo; along the screen-side edges to prevent the case from pulling away when lifting the tablet from the side. (NOTE Poetic - if you&rsquo;re reading this - get in touch if you&rsquo;re interested in what I mean by &lsquo;stiffeners&rsquo;). Still a great product, will recommend all day long.</p>

<h5 id="i-think-this-was-a-good-choice-for-me">I think this was a good choice for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tablet&rsquo;s new, not ready for prime time yet, but I knew when I bought it I&rsquo;d want some kind of rugged case that wasn&rsquo;t a book cover type. I think this was a good choice for me. I like the vented corners, and the high profile of the edges, even though they make typing somewhat clumsy, particularly at the bottom edge. But a well-protected tablet face trumps the occasional peskiness of a keying error in my book, anyday. Also, I appreciate the case&rsquo;s not being overly snug. I can remove it without cutting-off my fingers&rsquo; circulation, yet it&rsquo;s tight enough not to gap along the side edges. I also like being able to view the entire screen without obstruction. I can&rsquo;t comment on the speaker placement yet, but it seems like an intuitive move.My only negative criticism would be the weight of the case itself, and the material it&rsquo;s made of. It makes my feather-light tablet feel sort of heavy, and ìt&rsquo;s not very lint/dust/ grime-removal friendly. Stuff wants to stick to it more than I&rsquo;d prefer.The fact that the design of the back helps to keep the tablet from over-heating is valuable enough in and of itself to cancel out a couple of picky negatives.On the whole I think I made a very good purchase. I&rsquo;m going to enjoy using it.</p>

<h5 id="great-case-sadly-a-bit-too-small-for-the-s-pen-tablet">Great case. Sadly, a bit too small for the S Pen tablet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving 5 stars because of the quality and function of this case. I have the Tab A 10.1 with S Pen and thought that this case would be a goodfit for that model. After receiving the case and installing the tablet in it I found that the fit was not what I expected. Evidently there is a differencein size between the S Pen model and the non S Pen model. So much so that this case is too small for S Pen tablet. I checked the Poetic web-site and found only one case of this type for the Tab A 10.1. Turned out it was for the non S Pen tablet. I thought it would be a good fit but it wasa bit undersized for the S Pen tablet. I have this model case for my Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and the fit is perfect, I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with it. I willkeep the case, because in the future I may get a non S Pen Tab A 10.1. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s a great case and I highly recommend it. I justwish that Poetic made one specifically for the Tab A 10.1 with S Pen. If they did, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to purchase it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 tablet and I needed a case to prevent it from getting all scratched. There really isn&rsquo;t that many to choose from so I decided to give this one a try and I really like it. It is super bright neon green and it covers the entire screen and buttons. The rim is super thick which will surely prevent any damage caused by any drop. I don&rsquo;t see why people are saying that it is loose around the edges I actually struggled a bit to get it in at first but it wasn&rsquo;t to bad. It fits quite nicely not too tight and not to flimsy. My only complain is the SMELL. It is really strong!!! I thought if I wiped it down a bit the smell would go away, but no luck. The smell even gets on your hands and you have to wash them in order for it to go away. My tablet is new so I didn&rsquo;t want to use it before I had a cover on it. I regret putting it on so soon. Now it sort of smells like the case. Overall it&rsquo;s a good case, good color, and great protection. I would just recommend taking it out of the packaging and letting it air out for a few days. I&rsquo;m currently on day three and it is still really strong. I can&rsquo;t get myself to use my tablet yet :(</p>
