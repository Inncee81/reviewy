Product Description
The VIOlight travel offers the consumer the same benefits of sanitization as the original VIOlight but in the convenience of a travel sized version. Many travellers are exposed to a higher risk of contamination of their toothbrush due to leaving it on a hotel sink or uprotected in a dopp kit. The UV germicidal light bulb kills up to 99.9% of the bacteria, such as E.Coli, salmonella, and other harmful microorganisms. Researchers have found more than 10,000,000 bacteria can be living on a single toothbrush. Bacteria, molds, and fungi love moist environments which are commonly found in most plastic travel toothbrush holders. The ADA and most dentists recommend changing toothbrushes only every 3 to 4 months; however it is important to sanitize your toothbrush every day.</p>

<p>Amazon.com
No matter how often you scrub and clean, microscopic critters will still thrive in the warm, moist environment of the average bathroom. In fact, a single toothbrush can harbor millions of microorganisms &ndash; millions! &ndash; which means it&rsquo;s a good idea to sanitize something that you put in your mouth several times a day if you want to reduce your chances of bacterial infection.</p>

<p>The VIO200 is a handy, travel-friendly way to kill bacteria on your toothbrush. View larger.</p>

<p>Violight puts the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; back in oral hygiene.
If you already have the Violight VS100 Toothbrush Sanitizer, then you&rsquo;re aware of its nifty design and the peace of mind that it offers. However, it can be a bit difficult to tote the four-brush VS100 on business trips and vacations. That&rsquo;s where the new VIO200 Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer comes in. That&rsquo;s right, you can take toothbrush sanitization with you on the road, keeping your toothbrush sanitized wherever you go.
There&rsquo;s nothing worse than getting sick while traveling, but it can happen to anyone. Some people are exposed to germs in an obvious manner, such as sitting next to someone who is coughing and sneezing on the plane. But did you know that you can also be harmed by germs if you lay your toothbrush down on the counter in your hotel room? Whether you&rsquo;re staying in a cheap road-side motel or a five-star beach resort, hotel rooms are filled with germs. Even when a bathroom looks clean it may still suffer from microbial contamination.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s something to think about: if you plan on staying at a friend or family member&rsquo;s house instead of a hotel during your trip, the germ count in the bathroom will probably be even higher. Even if the people you&rsquo;re staying with are &ldquo;clean freaks,&rdquo; bathrooms are such a breeding ground for germs that it is near impossible for them to be bacteria-free. According to independent studies, Violight is able to kill 99.9-percent of the bacteria living on your toothbrush (including the influenza virus, streptococcus and staphylococcus) with its germicidal UV light . So no matter where you stay while you&rsquo;re traveling, you can rest assured the VIO200 will help keep your toothbrush clean and your immune system in tip-top working order. Plus, it&rsquo;s ultra-safe to use &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to mess with dangerous hot steam or boiling water.</p>

<p>The real benefit of the Violight, though, is that it provides peace of mind and good protection from all kinds of nastiness that might be lurking on your trusty bristles. Although toothbrushes don&rsquo;t feel any different after being sanitized by the Violight, it&rsquo;s nice to know that your brushes are clean and germ free. After finding out that the Centers for Disease Control has even stated that toothbrushes can be a significant source of &ldquo;potentially pathogenic organisms,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll be glad that the Violight is around. So if you&rsquo;re looking for the ultimate in brushing safety, you&rsquo;ll rest easy knowing that this handy sanitizer puts the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; back in oral hygiene.</p>

<p>There are few other things you can do to protect yourself from harmful germs. Travel experts advise you to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after you touch items that are prone to bacteria. You can also wipe down door knobs, lamp switches, telephones, and countertops with antibacterial swabs. And when it comes to the bathroom, whatever you do, keep your toothbrush off that counter. As Violight Travel Toothbrush Sanitizer inventor Joel Pinksys says, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t put a dirty fork or spoon that has been sitting on the counter overnight into your mouth without sanitizing it would you? The same should go for your toothbrush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So take it from Joel, get yourself a travel sanitizer. This device, which holds a single toothbrush and is powered by two AA batteries, serves as both a sanitizer and a safe, clean place to store your toothbrush while you&rsquo;re traveling. After you brush and rinse, simply put the brush in the case, push the button, and seven minutes later the device will shuts off automatically, and your toothbrush will be sanitized. The process couldn&rsquo;t be easier, and the results are well worth the effort.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="all-uv-toothbrush-travel-containers-do-not-work">All UV toothbrush travel containers do not work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Truth is there are no decent UV toothbrush travel containers anywhere. The Violife is the best of the best of another &ldquo;good idea, abominable execution&rdquo; product. This one never left my bathroom (no moisture from travel kit) but still only got three, maybe four UV cleanses before the new batteries died. It seems like the switch detent do not fit particularly well.I think it&rsquo;s past the return date, maybe the case will protect the bristles from airborne bacteria. Before you think about, don&rsquo;t try one of the other competitors, I&rsquo;ve tried the other basic type and its far worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bought-another-one">Bought Another One</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second one I have bought because I do like them, but for some reason they don&rsquo;t want to work right after a while. Changing the batteries helps, but mostly I have to take the batteries out, put them in, tap, tap, tap &amp; hope the light comes on. But I like the idea of the ultraviolet light enough to grit my teeth &amp; keep on trying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it to pieces! I travel with it and I get to show it off. I also replaced my regular toothbrush and only use this ultraviolet. Got to find a replacement toothbrush though. Kind of pricey! Have had it for at least 5 months and replaced the batteries once.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keeps-my-toothbrush-fresh">Keeps my Toothbrush Fresh!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this case! In the past 7 years I have owned 3 different sanitizing cases and this is by far, the best one yet!I travel quite often. (&gt;5 days out of the month) This has extended the life of my brushes and keeps them fresh. I have no complaints. I do not have to worry about letting my brush air dry. I can throw it in this case and pack it away. While using this product, I have not had a brush get moldy. My brushes always dry inside the case. The case never builds up any mold. The batteries last a favorable amount of time. I am happy with this.I recommend this product to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-expected">Works as expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works just as expected. It is a bit bulky so be sure you have a dopp kit large enough to accomodate. The toothbrush itself isn&rsquo;t the highest quality so I am on the look out for a brush that will fit into this (and fit the little grip inside).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keep-looking">Keep looking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry to say not a quality product at all. Case doesn&rsquo;t open or close well and the light works occasionally. Brush broke at the neck but wasn&rsquo;t bad while it lasted. Would NOT buy again or recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-product">Okay Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t always work, needs battery replacement more often than I think it should.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-this-buy-the-stericlean">DO NOT BUY THIS! BUY THE STERICLEAN!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So, I ordered this product last week, expecting it to be better than the other travel toothbrush sanitizer (the Stericlean one), and I must say that I couldn&rsquo;t be more disappointed. It came to me inoperable. The sanitizing light would not come on, despite my many exchanges of batteries. I will keep trying different batteries, but I would heed the side of caution on this product, and instead recommend the Oral Stericlean UV travel sanitizer. The QA on their product is more sound, and I never encountered a time purchasing that one where it didn&rsquo;t work (I have bought two, both broke by my own hand through traveling).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-for-a-while-then-nothing">Works well for a while&hellip;then nothing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I travel a lot for work, and I was looking for this product. It worked great for a while, and then it just stopped working. I made sure it always had fresh batteries, but no dice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-ok-buy">An &ldquo;OK&rdquo; buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use it when traveling. Good toothbrush but case is made of cheap plastic and feels like it could snap at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for myself. Works great, every time I use it. I wish I would had bought this for my daughter instead of the Oral SteriClean Family Toothbrush Sanitizer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-ever">best ever!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best toothbrush EVER!!! does the job of larger electric toothbrush but much smaller and much more convenient</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second purchase. Stopped working a few months ago. The first one failed in less than a year also. I definitely don&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="toothbrushes">Toothbrushes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought as a gift</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-toothbrush-holder">great toothbrush holder&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this toothbrush holder! Brush stays hygienically clean&hellip;I use it at home and for travel</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-recommend">I recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I need for my future travel plans</p>
