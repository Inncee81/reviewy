<h5 id="very-impressed">Very impressed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have heard a lot of things about virtual reality headset&rsquo;s so I was very curious to learn more about this product. My family is very into electronics. This headset is awesome. It is very easy to use. You simply download an app onto your smart phone and then can view photos or watch videos. When you were looking into the headset at a photo you can look up or look down in order to see different parts of the photo. We were looking at a photo of the earth and when he looked straight ahead there were trees and when you looked up you could see the stars. There are buttons on the top for you to adjust the vision. The headset is a little bit heavy but it is actually very comfortable to wear. It has a lot of padding that goes around your eyes. And I was even able to wear it with my glasses. The straps are sturdy enough to keep them on your face. Both mine and my husband cell phones fit into the front part despite the fact that they are different sizes and different models the phones. This set also comes with a remote control. Overall this is an awesome product that I would recommend anyone.</p>

<h5 id="great-entertainment">Great entertainment!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first experience with a virtual reality headset. My kids have been begging me to get us one. This gadget is awesome! Basically all you have to do is download some VR apps and place your phone correctly inside of it and you are ready to go. The strap is adjustable and with the right adjustments it can adjust to fit all of our heads perfectly and comfortably. Comes with cleaning cloth, cleaning wipes, foam to place around your phone to help with proper fitting due to different phone sizes and also comes with a Bluetooth remote controller gamepad. My kids have taken this over several times that I have had it out. I like the fact that it can be used with different smartphones. So when they take it over I can have them insert their phone while I get mine back. I have an iPhone and they have Samsung galaxy phones. This is great entertainment at a great price that&rsquo;s great quality.</p>

<h5 id="far-better-quality-easy-to-use-hours-of-fun">Far better quality, easy to use, hours of FUN</h5>

<p>This is 3d Vr headset is a must have. Very sturdy high strength plastic build. The headset viewer has a aerated soft leather cover for the face and an adjustable strap that will adjust to adults and children. There are vents on the side for heat emission and for earphones. The lens adjust for pupil and focal distance. I have used it with an Iphone 6splus and a the large Samsung. It is adjustable so I think it would fit almost any smartphone. Also comes with a remote. I have not played games with the remote, but I have used it to start and play and pause videos.Love the 360 panoramic view. Especially with the underwater apps. Puts a whole new spin on watching a movie. I found some amazing videos on youtube as well as dozens of apps to download. Warning! The VR headset will entertain you for hours. Time will fly. I used it for two hours before I knew it. Also a great occupier for kids. I would supervise them. For the price this is a superb buy. Several of us brought our VR headsets to work for a lunchtime &ldquo;Reality Party&rdquo; . I was so proud because this VR headset was a far better quality than the others. Especially the cardboard ones. Best of all the VR headset is very easy to use. I recommend this headset.</p>

<h5 id="amazing">AMAZING!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had absolutely no problems with delivery; the delivery was fast and promptly. I ordered this Canbor VR Virtual Reality Headset for my husband, he really like my sons. I scanned the QR code from the manual started up great. The remote is a very nice feature. Absolutely amazing! Truly feels like you are right there! You can completely forget you are not right in with ever experience you&rsquo;re viewing! Just unbelievable? Love the entertainment from this device. Takes you into a completely different world of adventure. A real experience that everyone should experience themselves. The focus is amazing; absolutely comfortable around your face and head. The attention to detail on this product; well made nice quality. Worked as advertised right out of the box. I also get great entertainment watching my kids play it. You&rsquo;ll love it! Incredible is like being there. Would recommend in a heartbeat!!!</p>

<h5 id="best-thing-is-the-remote">Best thing is the remote</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â Very excited to open the package! My video &amp; photo will show you all that&rsquo;s included. The instructions were very helpful as I really don&rsquo;t know much about VR. I used various phones (Apple/Android) from my friends and they all fit. Best thing is the remote. Sometimes you have to access (phone call) or navigate with your phone and the remote allows you to do so WITHOUT removing the phone from the headset - HELPFUL!</p>

<h5 id="hours-of-fun-games">Hours of fun games.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This VR headset is a beautiful piece, love the way it secures around the head and can tighten or loosen the straps. The VR headset user has a very soft leather cover to protect the head and under the eyes. The lens adjusts for pupil and focal distance. I love the remote, works great, and its also compatible with IOS or Android! This is a great go-to for everyone in my family, my children enjoy using this my husband and I even my mother! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great VR headset. This opens and closes with ease has a lens cleaning wipe and wet wipes to clean it off. The remote i love the way it feels on top of how amazing it works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Â Ok the fact that these have 3d video use it just awesome. I loved watching the live jungle filming and then the underwater video was great too. I felt like i was getting a personal view from my own home. It is great for movies too and since I like to watch youtube at times. this is just awesome VR to watch that as well. The remote control is easy to work and the use of bluetooth to have your volume control is great you don&rsquo;t have to change if your watching a video the remote does that for you. Works for both Android and IOS, I have an Android, and when you use the controller a small arrow pops up like a computer to work your VR program. Can&rsquo;t wait for the next movie.</p>
