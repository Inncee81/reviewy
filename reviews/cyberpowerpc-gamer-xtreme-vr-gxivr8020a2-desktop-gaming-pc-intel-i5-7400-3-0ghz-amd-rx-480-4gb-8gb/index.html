<blockquote>
<p>My husband and I have 7 year old laptop pcs. They finally died and we needed a new computer. My husband, a casual gamer, really wanted a gaming pc. Looking around at the big box stores, we did not think we would find one due to how expensive a quality pc is. After doing research and learning all the new lingo for pcs, my husband decided to pull the trigger on this pc. It has a new i5 processor and top home pc grahics processor. This computer blew the doors off of anything I thought we would be able to get. We paired it with an ASUS 24&rdquo; gaming monitor. This pc is great. The only downside is I am not used to a gaming keyboard. The keys are more spaced out than my computer at work, but it is a gaming pc. If you are questioning the speed and power of this pc, my husband plays Rainbow6 Siege on max settings with no problems. It comes with a 5g wifi adapter as well. Definately a BUY!!!!!</p>

<h5 id="powerful-little-gaming-system-once-setup-and-running">Powerful little gaming system, once setup and running.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(Not sure why, but Amazon rejected this review the first time, so I am trying again. There was a reference to the time it took to receive a replacement part, so maybe that was auto-flagged.)This is kind of a hybrid review, since all testing for the VR capabilities was done thanks to a friend of mine who bought an HTC Vive. He also already owned an earlier Cyber Power PC, so I enlisted him to help me understand some of the better aspects of a gaming PC like this one.My overall thoughts? This is a great gaming system for the right price. It has room for improvements, but a lot of those things could be upgraded down the road, and if I wanted more, I could have paid for more. The system costs less than my HTC Vive, but had absolutely no issues keeping up with VR gameplay. I&rsquo;m very satisfied with the system.The CYBERPOWERPC Gaming PC is a nice system once you have it setup. When you first plug it in, you have to go through the standard Windows setup, connect it to your network, download all the latest Windows and driver updates, etc, just like any other system. After the initial setup, the system still seemed a little slow, and I think this was due to the Microsoft Telemetry Compatibility scanner taking up CPU and thrashing the disk. I probably could have avoided this if I would have done a custom setup instead of the simple setup, but I wanted the machine up quickly so I could play games. If I had it to do over again, I&rsquo;d do the custom setup from the start to ensure I wasn&rsquo;t allowing Microsoft to scan my PC.The Cons:I had noticed almost right away after powering on the system, that there was a loud fan, that sounded like a cricket. It turns out that it was the CPU fan. I registered the PC, contacted support,and got a replacement CPU cooling fan, and that solved the problem. &hellip; Replacing the fan was very simple, and when I connected things back up, I didn&rsquo;t run the power cord under the heat fins. I&rsquo;m not sure if that was the source of the original noise, but I don&rsquo;t think it hurt to leave the wires out. The system is still a bit loud, but not bad when you consider there are 3 large cooling fans, a cooling fan for the CPU, one for the graphics card, and one for the power supply.The AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card has 1 HDMI and 3 DisplayPorts. When I plugged in my HTC Vive via HDMI, I had to go buy a DisplayPort to HDMI converter so I could connect to my TV. The motherboard on-board HDMI port didn&rsquo;t seem to work, so getting the adapter was the only way to do output to 2 HDMI devices that I could find.Minor Cons:The system only has 8 GB of RAM, but with 2 easily accessible memory slots, I&rsquo;ll probably upgrade it to 16 GB here shortly.The case has a transparent side, and the front and back are fairly translucent. All of the cooling fans glow, so if you plan to sleep in the room with your PC on, be prepared to have a night light.I also wish the system came with a SSD boot drive, and then the 1 TB drive for storage. If I hadn&rsquo;t been in such a rush to setup the system, I probably would have cloned the boot drive to a SSD drive, and used the 1 TB disk for games, and the SSD for faster boot times. The system isn&rsquo;t slow, but it could be faster with a SSD boot drive.Some VR games take some time to load. I don&rsquo;t know how much faster this would be if they were on SSD, or if the system had more memory, or if it were an i7 processor. Once they were running, I had no lag during gameplay, but loading new scenes sometimes takes a few more seconds than I&rsquo;d expect. Maybe more memory will help. I&rsquo;ll probably know soon enough.The Pros:Despite everything I&rsquo;ve said so far, this is a great gaming system. I connected my HTC Vive to the system, and mirrored output to the TV so others could see what I was seeing. The AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card, and i5 processor were able to keep up. I experienced absolutely no lag while playing games.Support was easy to work with to get the replacement CPU fan, which resolved the loud fan noise I had.I played some virtual pinball, with the output set to full screen, and all of the graphics options maxed out, and I was seeing an unbelievable 280 frames per second while the game was playing and updating over 480 trackable objects.The 1 TB drive has tons of space for downloading large VR games.(Photos show unboxing, and the printed instruction sheet that did not match the model of PC. Details, details.)</p>

<h5 id="amazing-deal-for-beginner-s-gamer-pc">Amazing deal for beginner&rsquo;s gamer PC</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow this computer is amazing. If someone were to just buy the parts along with windows 10, the cost would be over $800. This is an amazing deal.For those contemplating purchase. This pc comes with a gaming mouse and keyboard, 1 year of Mcafee antivirus free, a high speed wifi usb adapter free, and a free set of gaming headphones. The case is huge, giving plenty of room for further upgrades if needed. I can run league of legends easily at max settings with insane fps, (get a good 144hz monitor). This PC will also run pretty much any standard console game on max settings.</p>
