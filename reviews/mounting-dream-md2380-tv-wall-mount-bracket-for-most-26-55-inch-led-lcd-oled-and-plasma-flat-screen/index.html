<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was suprised with all the hardware this comes with. It came with multiple metric bolts for different thread sizes for different TV&rsquo;s. It comes with everything you need. As long as you mount it to a stud its not going anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-one-that-you-re-looking-for">This is the one that you&rsquo;re looking for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just what you want if you&rsquo;re looking to wall mount your big screen TV. I&rsquo;ve been using this type of mount for years. And, hear me, this is important&hellip;this unit comes assembled. Just take it out of the box and it&rsquo;s ready to mount. No assembly required.The good. It&rsquo;s well made. It can be mounted by one person&hellip;if you are experienced. It articulates easily and over a range that exceeds the mount I&rsquo;m using now. All the parts are there&hellip;The bad&hellip;nothing.Just remember to predrill your studs before you try driving the lag bolts that are used to secure the mount to the wall. And, you should use the outermost holes on the mount&hellip;they&rsquo;re 16&rdquo; apart and that coinsides with the distance between stud centers.A word of caution&hellip;if mounting to drywall, you should always find the studs, and then this mount should be screwed to the wall studs. Your TV might not seem as if it weighs much, but it can creat a lot of force when it&rsquo;s pulled away from the wall, and unsupported drywall will not handle the forces generated by moving and adjusting your TV over and over.Just my observations. Buy one.</p>

<h5 id="update-great-bracket-awesome-value">Update!! Great Bracket Awesome Value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit my Samsung 55 perfectly. The directions are easy to follow and straight forward. All the necessary hardware was included and the bracket itself is every bit the quality of the name brands they sell at the big box stores for five times the price. Leveling and tilting the unit was a cinch.If you found this review to be helpful please indicate so. If there&rsquo;s something missing, or you&rsquo;d like additional info, don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask. I write these in the hope that it will help other buyers make a decision with so many similar products available for purchase.Update: After several months of use, this bracket continues to impress. It hasn&rsquo;t loosened in the slightest. Even had compliments from a couple of friends that install professionally.</p>

<h5 id="a-really-good-wall-mount">A Really Good wall Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I purchased this for an outdoor wall mount project. The mounting dream wall mount was very easy to install because of the template that comes with it. It is very durable and well built. It also pulls out and can be angled to point in different directions. I bought a second one to add a second tv to my sons room. This wall mount was very easy to install and I highly recommend it. I put a quick video below. I hope this review was helpful.</p>

<h5 id="quality-solid-mount-is-versatile">Quality, Solid Mount is Versatile</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Versatile articulating panel TV bracket puts your TV exactly where you want it! Get the viewing angle right whether you tilt the TV down or aim it to the left or right for the best view.I found this to be a quality, solidly constructed, articulating wall mount for my 55&rdquo; TV. This model is designed for wall studs with 16&rdquo; centers. Studs further apart require a different model.CAVEATS:1. Drywall alone will not provide adequate support. The mount itself is heavy and built for large TVs and an overkill on a small TV.2. Centering on a wall. If mounting on wood studs with 16&rdquo; centers, you may not be able to place the mount exactly where you want. The mounting frame itself is approximately 17&rdquo;. Centering may require additional materials.3. Try to obtain a mounting template from the seller before purchase to avoid a return.It can also be mounted on solid wood or concrete. I mounted mine on culturedstone, which is made from concrete. It is not real stone.Mounting on concrete requires a &ldquo;hammer drill&rdquo; and hammer drill bit for concrete, so an investment in equipment may be required. Tapcon concrete screws can usually be screwed into the drilled holes and provide strong support. It is much easier to attach to wood wall studs with wood screws. Studs may not, however, always be exactly 16&rdquo; apart.It will take two people to lift a large TV onto the mount. Much of the wiring could be done before the lift. Since the mount adjusts, you do have adequate clearance to place wiring after the TV is installed.The mount is very compact and is inconspicuous. The TV moves freely to tilt up or down, or side to side. The more it is adjusted, the more wall clearance is required, thereby requiring you to pull the bracket forward.The instructions are excellent. Parts for installing various TVs are provided. A free HDMI cord, a level and assorted spacers are included. A template is also provided to mark where fasteners should be located.</p>

<p>Great! Just hard to move the arms and TV slide easily from left to right you need to be a bit careful</p>

<h5 id="still-in-shock">Still in shock!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok. Seriously IN LOVE with this mount. It was the simplest instructions and so much hardware for different options/TVs. This is easily drilled (as long as you can find the studs) due to the template that sticks on the wall. It literally gives you the drill bulls-eye spots to drill. This kit included a level (of which I used for installing other parts of my entertainment center as well). It also had an extra hdmi cable. I&rsquo;m blown away at how easy this was to install. This has so many adjustments that can be made and it turned our entertainment center into a home theater. Thank you!!</p>
