<h5 id="one-of-the-best-products-ever-bought-on-amazon">One of the best products ever bought on Amazon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this mount for $10. It is solid and easy to mount. The level and HDMI cable were an added bonus. I used the parts included. The only thing I did different from the instructions was to drill a slightly larger pilot hole. It went up with ease and works and looks great. I would definitely buy again. I&rsquo;m currently using it for a 24-inch, 9-Lb Samsung TV/monitor.</p>

<h5 id="this-bracket-is-inexpensive-sturdy-and-easy-to-install-it-s-a-perfect-bargain">This bracket is inexpensive, sturdy, and easy to install- it&rsquo;s a perfect bargain.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a cheap mount to put a cheap 19&rdquo; LCD in the garage. This bracket is such a bargain I ended up buying a second bracket to mount another small 19&rdquo; TV in the kitchen. This bracket is sturdy, a bit heavy, and not as small as I was anticipating. That said, this is a very substantial bracket considering the very affordable price. Two large lag bolts into a stud work great, and this kit comes with that hardware plus some pretty hardcore anchors (in case you need those, instead) as well as other goodies. Really, this bracket came with wall mounting hardware, TV mounting hardware, a small, magnetic torpedo level, a 10&rsquo; HDMI cable, three hook &amp; loop cable straps, a screen cleaning cloth and an LED flashlight keychain.So far, this bracket is more than sturdy enough for my 19&rdquo; TV&rsquo;s and I honestly don&rsquo;t think it would have a problem with a larger TV. It was fairly easy to install by myself with the small TV. I could say that I would purchase this again, but I already did and would again. This bracket is a great bargain.</p>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those nerds that do two weeks worth of research before buying a ballpoint pen and buying a TV mount was no exception. I scoured through dozens and dozens of wall mounts and finally settled on this Cheetah mount. I read all of the negative and positive reviews and decided that for the price it was worth a try (I paid $30.33). I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy the mount was. This wall mount was so solid that I believe it could have easily supported a much larger and heavier TV set. Yes, it was a bit tough to move at first as some reviewers noted but I would much rather it be too tough to move than too loose. In any case, it did quickly loosen up to where it was easy enough for my wife to move, yet it still stayed &lsquo;firm&rsquo; enough to hold the desired position. I did not find the construction flimsy at all as some noted, quite the contrary it was durable and heavy.Installation was really easy and while I am pretty handy the directions were simple enough for anyone to follow; in fact I found it so easy that I installed the mount and TV by myself (of course the TV only weighed about 25 lbs). Once a stud was located the mount was rock solid. It was nice to be able to move our older 32 inch Olevia in any direction (up, down, side to side, in, out). I really wanted an articulating arm and this did the trick. The bolt pattern on the back matched up to the obscure pattern on our TV just fine. The HDMI cable and the level made it an even better value. One reviewer noted this his TV dipped to one side. My TV dipped also, but it was easily fixed when I slightly tightened the silver nut on the back of the up/down swivel. It has held a perfect level ever since.I ordered the Hol-E-Cap wall cover kit to give a really clean look to hide the wires behind our drywall (this also was a great value and easy to install). I waited for six months before writing this review and I have moved the TV all over in various directions and it has held great every time. Not a single issue since installation. If you are looking for a great TV wall mount and do not want to pay hundreds of dollars than this wall mount is for you.</p>

<h5 id="good-deal-for-the-price">Good deal, for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For $15, this can&rsquo;t be beat. It&rsquo;s constructed solidly with a combination of stamped sheetmetal parts and hollow bar stock. It seems to support my 19&rdquo; monitor very nicely.Unlike some customers, I found the hardware that came with the product to be fine for the job at hand. I pre-drilled the anchor bolts with a pilot hole, then drilled them with the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; bit as instructed in the manual. The plate was however, slightly to big to fit on my circa 2005 19&rdquo; Dell Monitor. I rounded off the corners with an angle grinder and then it fit perfectly.The finish on the product is of poor quality. The hollow bar stock which make up the arms is pitted and doesn&rsquo;t look like it was cleaned or prepped before the paint was applied. The plastic end caps on the bar stock also don&rsquo;t fit very nicely. I bought this to put in my workshop, not my living room so I don&rsquo;t really care.If you&rsquo;re looking at this product for a living room or bed room, you may want to consider another product if finish is important to you. If you&rsquo;re looking for something functional and construction, not appearance is the primary concern, this may be the mount for you.</p>
