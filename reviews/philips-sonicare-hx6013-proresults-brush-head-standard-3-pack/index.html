<p>Snap-on replacement brush heads feature a larger surface area and radial-trimmed, contoured bristles. View larger.</p>

<p>Angled Bristles Cover Larger Surface Area
The curved surface area created by the brush head&rsquo;s radial-trimmed bristles help you maintain contact with the surfaces of the teeth and gums as the brush head pivots.</p>

<p>The bristles&rsquo; contoured pattern fits the natural shape of your teeth. Peaks and valleys along the length of the brush head are ergonomically designed to fit between teeth, so you&rsquo;re less likely to miss places when you brush. This means you can remove more disease-causing plaque for a healthier mouth.</p>

<p>Replace Every Three Months
You can&rsquo;t see it, but your brush head wears over time. Blue reminder bristles fade in color to let you know when it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Dental professionals recommend replacing your brush head every three months. Sonicare technology helps you remove up to two times more plaque compared to a manual toothbrush.</p>

<p>Fits Multiple Sonicare Handles
The ProResults Compact brush head works with the following Sonicare models:
DiamondClean, FlexCare+, FlexCare, HealthyWhite, and EasyClean.</p>

<p>The heads easily snap onto handles and come with caps for hygienic storage and travel.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fake-do-not-buy">FAKE - Do Not Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The brush heads I received were obviously counterfeit and not authentic Philips products. Although the packaging was very convincing and official looking and actually said &ldquo;Philips&rdquo;, the performance of the brush heads was nowhere near the stock heads that came with the brush.- The bristles were extremely soft and ineffective- After a week of use the bristles were completely bent over and useless- Inside the shaft they were missing the bump that snaps them in place on the toothbrush so the brush heads would fall off easilyShame on Amazon for listing &ldquo;Philips&rdquo; below the product name because they are definitely not authentic Philips products but rather counterfeit lookalikes.As with other fakes manufactured in questionable countries who knows what else may be wrong with these brush heads&hellip;..toxic paint, lead, etc&hellip; For something that I am going to put in my mouth twice a day I&rsquo;m not going to take that risk. Unfortunately from now on I will inconveniently only purchase my replacement brush heads from a brick and mortar store that also sells the Philips tooth brushes so I know they will be authentic Philips brand brush heads.Philips has created a perfect scenario for counterfeiters by charging such extremely high prices for a product that is extremely cheap to manufacture. This is similar to other highly counterfeited products such as expensive hand bags and expensive sun glasses. These brush heads can probably be manufactured for less than $0.20 each and are sold for $8.00 each. It&rsquo;s a counterfeiters dream scenario with a 4000% markup.</p>

<h5 id="buyers-beware-this-product-is-a-counterfeit">Buyers Beware - this product is a counterfeit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read the reviews here that said that they received a fake copy instead of the original product, and thought it wouldn&rsquo;t happen to me. I thought, for sure Amazon would have fixed this by now. No luck!Even before I opened the package, I had a bad feeling. It arrived shoddily wrapped in a piece of plastic, taped by scotch-tape. The package itself looked fine, but when I opened it, it was immediately obvious it was a fake, a very poor copy. The bristles of the brush literally look like they were cut by hand, uneven, longer pieces sticking out here and there. The ProResults label also looks odd, crooked, some letters are in different size, done in what most resembles shimmer nail polish and already half-peeled off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-fit-for-my-flexcare">Perfect fit for my FlexCare+</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These brush heads work great on my FlexCare+ toothbrush. The bottom of my brush has HX6950 on the bottom of it, hopefully that helps anybody looking for replacement heads.These brushes work well and through a combination of better care and using this toothbrush, I&rsquo;ve had better visits with my dentist and hygenist.</p>

<h5 id="absolute-junk-save-your-money">Absolute Junk Save your money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never been more disappointed in a product ordered from Amazon. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I got the shaft on this one. OK, the package looks identical to the one that I purchased from a grocery store. They look relatively the same but in comparison, the bristles of these are slightly lighter in color. There are some large numbers etched into the front of these, the ones format he store have small print. Now, I put the brush head on my Sonicare Toothbush, turned it on and the thing went flying off and across the bathroom! Well, lets try it again, put it on, turn it on, vibrated right off again. I&rsquo;m giving the brush heads the benefit of the doubt so I switch heads and try it again&hellip;same thing. I also purchased 2 packages as gifts, so I call the recipient and ask them to try these out on her toothbrush&hellip;what an embarrassment when she told me that her&rsquo;s also instantly vibrated off of her toothbrush.After several attempts to get the thing to stay together I finally hold pressure on it with my hand. The brushes where extremely soft, too soft to actually clean your teeth, I can not say it enough how disappointed I am with these toothbrush heads. I would like to say that I got a bad package, but I purchased (3) three packs and all were the same. I&rsquo;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for the last 5-6 years and this is the first and the last time I purchase them from the internet. Very upset with this purchase, they are going back, used or not. I&rsquo;m pretty sure these are knockoffs of the original.</p>

<h5 id="only-last-one-week">Only last one week!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not understanding all the five star reviews. These &ldquo;Proresults&rdquo; toothbrush heads only last one week. They are generic and NOT the original standard Sonicare heads&hellip;. otherwise they would have the Sonicare name printed on the head itself. How whomever makes these is able to get away with putting the Sonicare name on the packaging is beyond me. And they even have the same USB number as well. Sonicare has discontinued this product so the company must have farmed this product out to the highest bidder.Do not buy unless you want to change out the head every week or only brush your teeth once/day. Even then, one won&rsquo;t last more than two weeks. I am posting three photos of the toothbrush heads&ndash; one brand new, the other only one week old. You be the judge.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-these-are-fake-fake-fake-fake-you-will-lose-money-even-if-you-try-to-return">DO NOT BUY THESE ARE FAKE!!!! FAKE FAKE FAKE! You will lose money even if you try to return!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT BUY THESE ARE FAKERecently I purchased these toothbrush heads thinking that they were legit only to find out that they are cheap FAKES and do not work. I bought real Sonicare tooth brush heads to compare to these fakes and they are completely different. The real ones have serial numbers and the ProResults lettering looks different not to mention that the bristles are also long and seem to be cut terribly on these fakes. The seller accepted my return request, but to send back it&rsquo;s another fee for return shipping on top of the initial cost for shipping in the first place. So basically even if you do decide to return these fake tooth brush heads you will be losing money on shipping. I am a regular customer on Amazon and I feel so violated that Amazon has not banned this product considering there are other reviews claiming that this product is fake. I usually don&rsquo;t ever write reviews but I had to on this one. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</p>
