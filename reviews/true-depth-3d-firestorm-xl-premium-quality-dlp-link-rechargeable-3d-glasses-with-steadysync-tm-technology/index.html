<h5 id="very-nice-glasses-with-two-minor-flaws">Very nice glasses with two minor flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My old glasses: I have been using these incredibly obnoxious pair of 1st gen Xpand glasses that I had to take a key and pry out a proprietary battery, which snapped off and got stuck because of how poorly they were designed. The batteries were supposed to last 500 hours, but it seems like they would last about 2 weeks with 1-hour of use before they would die, even though I kept them in the box away from light sources. I actually completely stopped using my 3DTV because of how terrible my old glasses were.These True Depth 3D glasses are an incredible improvement over my last pair!Pros:- Very comfortable to wear. I have prescription glasses, and they fit just fine over my glasses even for long viewing sessions.- They sync up perfectly with my Mitsubishi DLP TV without any additional IR sensors.- From pushing the power button it takes less than half a second before they start to sync so there&rsquo;s no waiting involved.- Came with extra nose-piece to make it more comfortable from child to adult.- Came with bags to store them which will keep them from being exposed to IR light that could drain and damage the batteries.- 50 hours of continuous use.- Charge time is only 2-3 hours. Light goes off to let you know it&rsquo;s fully charged.Cons:- The glasses have a tint to them that changes based on how you have your head. If you look slightly to the left, a dark blob comes up over the screen. This is only seen in dark or black sections. Bright sections are crystal clear, and if you look straight on at the picture, you should have no problems.- You cannot use these glasses while they are charging. This means you must keep them charged at all times, or plan your 3D sessions ahead of time. Other rechargeable glasses give you the option of using them while they are charging, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be a deal-breaker since it&rsquo;s not very comfortable to have a cord resting on the side of your head either.Tip: Unfortunately, both the amazon description and the packaging fail to mention the type of battery for this device. I am going to assume it is a lithium-ion battery which means it likes to stay fully charged. When you are done using these, plug them back into a USB charger right away for your next session. This will save you from having to recharge them next time you want to use them as well as sustain maximum battery life potential.</p>

<h5 id="great-glasses-for-the-benq-w1070">Great glasses for the BenQ W1070</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 pairs of the True Depth 3D Firestorm LT glasses and promptly returned these for several issues which have all been addressed with this updated model of the LT. The glasses work perfectly so there is nothing more to say there, they do exactly what you want and do it perfectly. The fit of these glasses are great for an adult and very comfortable, they may be a little large for children. The lenses are large allowing full view of large screens without head tilting or adjusting the glasses on your face. They sync up instantly and stay in sync the entire movie even if you look away from the screen for moment. If you are considering buying the BenQ glasses just stop. These are better, stay in sync better and provide a brighter image than the BenQ glasses and you can get 2 pairs for around the price of 1 pair of the BenQ glasses. I had several complaints on the Firestorm LT glasses which you can read in my review of them, of those complaints only 1 carries over to XL model and that is the fact that they only include a USB charging cable and no wall charger (you have to use a USB port) and they even changed the mini USB end that plugs into the glasses with a less common or maybe even proprietary connection, so even if you have some mini USB wall chargers already you can&rsquo;t use them with these glasses. Your only option other than plugging them into a computer is if you have a USB wall charger to plug their cable into. I just feel this should be included in the package. I can make due using what I have but it may be an issue for others and worth mentioning. One other very small thing, and I only mention this because a rep from True Depth commented on my review of the LT model glasses, the box that the LT glasses came in was well made and I had every intention of using it to store the glasses in. The new box is more of just a box, not as nice as the first design. I don&rsquo;t know if the box was really intended to use as storage since they provide a cloth case but the box was so nice, well made and convenient it would have been great to provide some extra protection. All in all the glasses really are fantastic and the USB cable does allow for charging so really that issue is far outweighed by the quality and function of the glasses. The box&hellip;&hellip;..that comment was for True Depth not for you to consider in your decision.</p>

<h5 id="decent-glasses-better-than-sainsonic">Decent Glasses, better than Sainsonic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first glasses were the Sainsonic ones, one of the 2 pairs failed after only a few hours of use so I bought a couple of pairs of these on a whim to see how they compare and have some backup glasses. The quality on these is much better, less red, and no problems working. They are bigger than the Sainsonic ones so some people might find them less comfortable compared to these, but personally I like them better and they come with different sized rubber pieces for the nose part of the frame so you can make them a better fit if needs be.</p>
