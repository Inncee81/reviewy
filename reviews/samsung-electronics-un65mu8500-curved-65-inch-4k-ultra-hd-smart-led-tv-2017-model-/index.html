<h5 id="best-55-inch-curved-4k-tv-out">Best 55 inch curved 4k tv out!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this at best buy not here. I buy all things through amazon but upgrading tv&rsquo;s i had to do in person. I wanted to write a review for amazon because this tv doesnt deserve a 3.5 rating. Sorry customers who had issues you should have returned for another 1 because this model made the top 10 best 4k tvs of 2017 and samsung owns 3 of the 10 spots.Ok so heres the true review of this tv. I wanted to spend between 6-800.00 on a 4k curved tv and i found one that was a 6 series for 799.00 up above that tv was this tv which is an 8 series. The difference is very noticable because it has the hdr which makes colors richer and brighter and more natural. Watch planet earth 2 and youll see what i mean. I had never owned a 4k tv but i have to say you must have one with hdr it makes a huge difference. The other thing that i noticed was the refresh rate or motion rate. On normal 4k tvs its 120 hz on this tv its 240hz and trust me if you watch sports or play video games this makes a big difference. Dont get me wrong the other 6 series 55 in 4k tv had an outstanding picture but this tvs picture took my breath away. Ive never seen a more rich colorful tv in my life. This tv was 1500.00 i believe but is on sale here as well so for a few hundred more 300.00 to be exact you can upgrade from 6 series to an 8 series and its a very noticable difference. I highly highly recommend this tv to anyone. Sure i wanted to save money but if i didnt get this tv id regret it and this tv truely mad me happy. Its the best 55 inch tv i saw and i promise that youll be happy and your family will be blown away.I just wanted to add that the people who had issues are inpatient. There are always going to be a few tvs that arent right because things get dropped during transport ect&hellip; amazon has always given a refund or sent another product until i was happy. Amazon has the best return/refund policy out there. So i bet the people who left bad reviews did it before amazon refunded them or sent a new one.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-tv">Excellent TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TV is clear, but keep shutting off after 15 to 30 minutes of use, sent in an email to Amazon, bought the unit today 7-15-2017, will see how Amazon deals with this issue and will update you on the outcome.Update. Direct TV Box must be plugged directly to wall or one surge protector, cannot be plugged into a surge protector plugged into another surge protector, all is good, TV is great.</p>

<h5 id="nice-innovative-future-proofed-but-not-perfect-tv">Nice, innovative, future-proofed but not perfect TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice TV, especially if you can spend a little more than average and want a bit of future-proofing but still need to stay under $2k. Even though I could technically afford it I will always have some qualms with paying over $2k for a TV.The picture looks good in HD and non, and the sound is decent without a soundbar (although I&rsquo;d recommend getting one anyway). For the UHD content you can find, it does look amazing. I do wish there was a THX movie display option like on my old TV; I had to mess around with the movie settings and Google for advice before I got it to look the way I wanted. And I also wish there was a Custom profile I could set up separate from the existing display profiles.I am not ready to give this TV five stars because I haven&rsquo;t watched enough of what I bought it for: pro football and 4k/HDR movies. There&rsquo;s still a lack of the kinds of streaming movies I&rsquo;d like to watch in the format: new and older action, sci-fi, and summer blockbuster type flicks.All that having been said, the curved choice is still an interesting debate. If you are going to have more than a couple of people watching it on the regular from broad angles, you might still go with the flat screen model. It really just depends on how wide your sofa is and how far away from the TV you are. If I glance from the kitchen while I&rsquo;m cooking, as an example, I&rsquo;m probably looking at it from a 45-60 degree angle. The picture doesn&rsquo;t look bad; maybe no worse than on a flat TV. But the curve really visually amplifies the fact that you&rsquo;re not looking at it from an optimal angle.A few things I don&rsquo;t like: these minimal button remotes suck. I prefer the old style where I had 30 buttons for one-click nav. Scrolling through menus is such a waste of time. I also don&rsquo;t like that fact that there&rsquo;s no central pedestal-type stand like on my old TV. I ended up buying a stand to attach because it was cheaper than buying and building a new, wider TV stand. Setting it up with all of this Samsung account garbage (my cell phone is also a Samsung) was a pain and another example of how everyone is being forced into being analyzed and tracked. To that end, the fact that the remote has a mic also bothers me. I do not need or want a MICROPHONE IN MY TV REMOTE. I can&rsquo;t wait until they find a reason to start putting cameras and mics into smart headboards and toilets.Overall, I would recommend this TV. If they sports and eventual broader 4k/HDR content looks good, I might eventually bump it to 5 stars. For now 4 is fair.</p>

<h5 id="curve-tv-is-way-better-than-expected">Curve TV is way better than expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was little hesitant about curve tv as there are lot of critics saying it&rsquo;s a gimmick like 3D tv, etc. But my perception changed completely after having one. Now, my future plan is to change out the larger living room flat tv as it looks outdated. I see myself spending more time watching in the room although living room&rsquo;s tv is larger. I&rsquo;ll go as far as saying I&rsquo;ll buy one today IF they&rsquo;re getting rid of curve tv&rsquo;s tomorrow. Default picture quality was disappointing as usual for any new tv but became great after tweaking. I prefer traditional remote but not a big deal. I let it on for all day but no issue so far. Delivery was on time, and they moved it to room of my choice, which was 2nd floor. Mine is 55&rdquo; so I had no problem setting it up myself. I already ordered 2nd one for another room. Bought two of these for price of one latest QLED tv. I would&rsquo;ve chosen OLED instead of QLED if I wanted to spend that much money on one tv.</p>
