<h5 id="awsome-great-purchase-detailed-review">AWSOME - great purchase - detailed review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, after re-searching for over 3 days, looking at as many as 30 skeleton frame mounts for the GoPro 4 Silver, I decided on this one. It having 28 five star, 3 one star and 2 two star, always makes me a bit un-easy. Claims of being made cheap, falling apart is never a good sign. So here we go.I have used this a couple of times. Opened/closed dozens of times. Back door seems to work properly, no binding, holds the GoPro 4 Silver tightly. Next to see if the materials are about the same, so I put just the front housing on a scale. The original case was 1.680 oz. while this case was 1.430 oz. (remember there is a few holes in it). Next to look at exact size differences. The original case is 1.72 mm (.0685&rdquo;), while this case is 1.42 mm (.0560&rdquo;) thickness. No question about it, the original case is .3 mm thicker. The outside dimensions seem to be the same. The metal spring clip at .0545&rdquo; (1.38 mm) it the exact same and the same length. As for looks, all case markings look identical as if they came from the same mold.The last thing that concerned me was the size of the cable cut out. In a few of these I saw, if you had a some with larger cable end, it would bind going in and out. I really did not want to put that kind of pressure on the GoPro. The cables I bought were the KabelDirekt Micro HDMI to HDMI, which do have a rather large housing around the plug. There was plenty of room, no modifications of any type were needed,So overall, this case was a wise investment and I would recommend this over all the others, hands down, I was not paid for this review, as you can search for other reviews I have done and WILL update this if my opinion changes in ant way.One last note: The case was shipped to me in a heavy envelope, not very impressive. Even at that it held up, so I can not imagine not holding up over the long haul, Also when I first looked at it I was a bit upset as there was clearly a problem with the clear lens not being clear, then I calmed down and found a plastic film protecting it for shipping. Good Luck!</p>

<h5 id="high-quality-case">High quality case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always been very careful with my GoPro camera&rsquo;s. This case feels very solid and well made. And, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the door squeezes the camera too much. The side and microphone cut outs work very well. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for protection and accessibility for their Hero4 Silver.</p>

<h5 id="makes-my-gopro-water-resistant-and-permits-external-power">Makes my GoPro Water &ldquo;Resistant&rdquo; and permits external power &hellip; .</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use a GoPro 3+ camera mainly for my bicycle rides. I have an external battery that runs the camera so as to avoid having to carry a pocket full of spares along with all those stops to change the battery. Most of my rides go for 2 to 3 hours.There have been a couple of times that when some bad luck occurs, and over the handle bars and I hit the pavement. So, needless to say, since the camera is mounted on top of my helmet, it usually gets the first hit as I make a spectacle of myself.Originally I used one of those mounts that just holds the camera onto my helmet, and I would put one of those lens protectors on. A couple of times, those lens protectors saved the camera&rsquo;s lens.But I have noticed that on rare occasions I will get a splash of water on my head from a sprinkler operating as I ride by. Not enough to justify entombing the camera in that sealed little transparent box that came with the camera &hellip; you know the one I mean&hellip;.. the one that has no way to connect an external power source so all rides, as far as the video goes, end in about an hour and a half (unless I actually stop and fumble around and change the battery) and, of course, the audio is practically useless.Now I find this Skeleton Housing on Amazon from WiserElectronic that has an opening where I can connect a USB power cable to the camera. This opening also permits removal of the SD card when I get back so I can download all that video.There is also another small opening on top of this housing for audio to make it to the camera&rsquo;s microphone (another problem with the stock waterproof case was crummy audio). This small hole is part way under the clip used to close the case so it would take a really &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; shot to get a drop of water to find that opening. If I was to crash into a lake, then this Housing would probably not be very protective, but for what I normally do on rides, it should be that extra protection I want.Now I can ride for 3 or more hours with the camera recording, and getting good audio without the constant fear of every drop of water easily wiping out the camera. And, &ldquo;if&rdquo; I take another header over the handlebars, the camera should come out unscathed, but I should get another great video!</p>

<h5 id="wiser-skeleton-open-side-housing">Wiser Skeleton Open Side Housing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having just purchased the Go Pro 4 Silver Surf Edition, my very 1st Go Pro, I didn&rsquo;t realize it would not come with a skeleton case. I actually didn&rsquo;t know I would need one. My first video showed me that there was almost no sound! After reading up a bit, I discovered that the microphone is covered by the waterproof case and even without the case, the sound was awful. The recommendation was to add a microphone to it but in order to do that, you have to be able to access the port on the side. After I looked around, I found this little gem. I received it in two days (Thanks Amazon Prime!) and got a chance to try it out yesterday. This not only looks and feels like the durable housing that is provided with the Go Pro but also comes with a touch screen back. The back actually allows for better touch screen accessibility than the one that came with my Go Pro. I am able to attach it to my Go Stick and other equipment AND use the purchased microphone I have. I am very pleased with this and I know it&rsquo;s going to do great on an upcoming cruise this week. Do not spend $40-$50 on a less protective skeleton housing when you can get this for about $25 that adds more security and accessories.</p>
