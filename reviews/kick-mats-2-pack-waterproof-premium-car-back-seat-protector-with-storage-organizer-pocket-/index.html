<blockquote>
<p>These back seat car mat covers are perfect! They provide protection for “little feat” and also my dogs. I can easily store electronics, snacks, tissues, small travel wipes, etc. for passengers in the back or longer trips. It keeps items for travelling handy and neatly organized. Very attractive and easy to install and not bulky or loose. They are adjustable for a wide range of seat sizes. The fabric is nice and durable and easy to clean with a damp cloth. There were other organizers out there that were less expensive, but they also looked a little cheaper and the pockets didn’t stay flat when not in use. I already have one that is very bulky and is more of a nuisance than an organizer. These are a snug and neat fit and remain flat to the seat without getting in the way of backseat passengers. I am so happy I took another shot at back seat mat covers and ordered these. They are a great product at a great price. I highly recommend, especially if you have children. ** I rely heavily on reviews from others when purchasing items online so I try to be as thorough and honest in giving my opinion as possible. I appreciate your feedback, so if you have found my review helpful, please take a moment to click on &ldquo;yes” to let me know. **</p>

<p>I love having these car seat kick mats. I have a young child that is always jumping in puddles and getting the back of the seat dirty and now I do not have to worry about getting mud, or other things young children step in on a rural farm. Clean up is a breeze, as these can be cleaned easily, and there is also enough room in the 2 pouches for a tablet (yay! quietness in the vehicle!) and a ziplock bag of snacks. I love having a neat and tidy place to keep things from being stepped on in the vehicle. I am happy for two because they can go on each seat, which comes in handy if you are carrying multiple children around. Installing them is as easy as snapping a belt together and they seem sturdy and well made. The kick mats are weighted both top and bottom to make sure they are always hanging correctly. I am very pleased with this purchase and am happy to have such a handy place to keep things neat and tidy.</p>
