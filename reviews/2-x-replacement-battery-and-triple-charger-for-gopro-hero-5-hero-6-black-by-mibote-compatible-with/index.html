<h5 id="definitely-works-with-v01-55">Definitely works with v01.55</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t want to return the Smatree 2pk batteries with the 3 channel charger but since the update of v01.55 for the GoPro Hero 5, this update disabled 3rd party batteries inoperable&hellip; Shame on the GoPro company.Then this comes along on Amazon, Mibote 2pk battery with a 3 channel charger with a claim stating that it&rsquo;s compatible with v01.55 that I decided to take a chance and I&rsquo;m glad I did. I can say this is that it works with no problem with the recent update on the GoPro Hero 5. As soon as I got these in the mail I did 2 run test on these batteries after I fully charged them and this is what I got&hellip;Setting wifi on and voice &amp; gps off, brightness 40%, 1080@601st battery (1hr 40min)2nd battery (1hr 44min)I&rsquo;m sure turning wifi off I would get just a tad bit longer battery life but overall I&rsquo;m satisfied with these after my quick test results and hopefully would be purchasing another set soon. Would be nice if they would sell just the batteries by itself without the charger ;) since I have the charger already.Main reason on buying these was that I as a consumer have a choice on purchasing OEM or 3rd party batteries and let me take a chance on where my money is spent.***UPDATE Review *** 12/29/2016I got an email that I received from the seller of the Mibote batteries that after they have read my review and like what I wrote about selling the batteries without the charger&hellip; Well they are providing that option as they are sending the goods to the Amazon warehouse. Soon we the consumers can purchase just the batteries :) THANKSOne more note&hellip; I do believe that leaving a feedback is not only possible for us(the buyer) to understand the quality of the product but also helps the seller to make changes if they are able to within there powers.</p>

<h5 id="was-hoping-for-a-good-product">Was hoping for a good product..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: Customer service has been excellent and sent me a new charger at no cost. The problem was solved and my batteries are charged!Believe I received a defective charging base. The only lights that show are green, no red or blue. I even put my original GoPro battery on there and I know it was almost dead and light still remained green. Was hoping for a great product but disappointed that it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellen-batteries">Excellen Batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have completely charged the batteries and then recorded at 1080 with 60 frames per min, with gps and voice command on and got great results. the first battery lasted 1h48m and the second one lasted 1h51m. That is awesome. I was used to getting 45 min to an hour on my batteries on the hero 3. The chargers is also very nice as you can charge three batteries at a time. If you need some spare batteries i would highly recommend these. They even work with the latest gopro update.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-good-product">Overall good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Delivery was outstanding! Charger and both batteries work fine. As for the duration of the batteries I can not say because I haven&rsquo;t fully used the batteries. I do have a slight complain but it&rsquo;s not a big deal only that the original GoPro hero 5 battery is slightly wider so when I put it in the charger it&rsquo;s a bit snug and a little difficult to push in. Also when you put the batteries in to charge you have to make sure to push them in all the way. I didn&rsquo;t do this and I thought that it didn&rsquo;t work. Other than those two minor issues I&rsquo;m satisfied with my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-product-works-great-with-the-newest-hero-s-as">Awesome product. Works great with the newest Hero&rsquo;s as &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product. Works great with the newest Hero&rsquo;s as I purchased both in late march for my cruise. Great capacity, quick charging, and no detectable difference in performance between this and the OEM battery. I even loaned them out on the cruise to people who forgot to charge their OEM battery and we all were able to capture great memories!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-with-newest-firmware-as-of-1-22-2017">Work with newest firmware (as of 1/22/2017)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just updated the firmware in my new Hero 5 Black today (1/22/2017) and these batteries are still compatible with the newest firmware. So whatever problems other third party brands are having don&rsquo;t apply to this brand. They seem pretty decent so far.</p>

<h5 id="comes-in-handy">comes in handy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this as a gift for my brother in-law who have 2 go pros and loves to use them. It a great convenient go pro battery charger. He has 4 batteries for his 2 go pros just in case one battery dies he has an extra one. He love taking video of day to day activities and he needs the battery life. This charging battery bay can hold 3 batteries if needed. It’s easy to set up and use and put the batteries in the bays. It’s a good price for the charger. Also, there is a 1 year warranty if it breaks or you don’t like it you can send it back. I do recommend this go pro battery charger.</p>

<h5 id="the-batteries-worked-for-several-months-but-i-ve-now">The batteries worked for several months, but I&rsquo;ve now &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries worked for several months, but I&rsquo;ve now discontinued using them. One of the batteries got stuck in the camera and was difficult to remove. When I finally did get it out, I found that the battery casing was distorted. There were bulges on one side and the bottom, and it would not longer charge (even if I had wanted to put it back in the camera).I contacted seller and asked if it was possible that the battery had exploded. Seller responded that they would send me a replacement battery. They never did, despite two follow-up reminders.I&rsquo;ve now discontinued using the product because I am unsure about the safety of these batteries.</p>

<h5 id="you-cannot-go-wrong-with-these-for-the-price">You cannot go wrong with these for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was shocked on how small this unit was (smaller than my GoPro Hero 5). This charger supports USB-C so you will only need one cable for both the GoPro or the charger.</p>
