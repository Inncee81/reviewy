<h5 id="more-than-worth-the-money">More Than Worth the Money!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> We bought this projector for digital decorating for Halloween for the first time. It was the 2nd mini projector we bought - the first wouldn&rsquo;t work for the project I was doing. I didn&rsquo;t quite know what to expect ordering another small projector. When I received this one I was pleased with the sturdier &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and quality of it. Right out of the box it felt like a much better projector. When I plugged in the flash drive with the digital images I wanted to run - it worked perfectly right off the bat. Another GREAT feature was that it has a headphone jack which allowed me to plug in external speakers. Even though the speakers on the projector are quite susfficient - this was outside and I needed the extra volume. I really like the small size - I had bought 2 other projectors because we were told to get 1800+ lumens but they&rsquo;re full size and very bulky. However, this small, easy-to-operate, 1500 lumen projector was more than bright enough for what I was doing. Instead of putting this away for a year to only use on Halloween (as I&rsquo;ll be doing with the other two bigger ones), I&rsquo;m keeping this out to use for movie watching!! :DI&rsquo;ve included two very short video that shows the projection of the digital files onto uncarved pumpkins - as you can see - this projector did a wonderful job! Would recommend it highly.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="expectations-may-have-been-to-high-but">Expectations May Have Been To High, But&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its okay for an inexpensive LED projector. Don&rsquo;t expect a big bright, beautiful, clear image. If you are use to a powerful vivid HD quality projector you will be disappointed. I purchased it for a little travel around presentation projector. It gets the job done. The video review on it makes it seem a lot better than what you actually get. From that video I was a little disappointed.&mdash;&mdash; end of original review &mdash;&mdash;-Added 2/9/2017:One More Thing&hellip; they have excellent customer service. When they saw my original &ldquo;Three Star&rdquo; review they immediately reached out to me via e-mail and wanted to know if they could do anything for me to fix my issue, they even offered me a discount to the price I paid to make it up to me or return the unit for a full refund.The following is my response to their e-mail, sent on 2/8/2017&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;2/8/2017&rdquo;Thank you for your e-mail and your concern. I appreciate the gesture.As for the unit, I can work with it, as I stated &ldquo;it gets the job done&rdquo;. I use it for a basic video presentation.I think my expectations were high as to the quality of the picture. The demo video that is linked to the Amazon page for your projector is what sold me on the product. The unit in the video looked like it gave off a clear vivid, crisp powerful picture in the video. According to my perception I was not able to get that same quality image that I saw in that video, hence my review. I tried to express my experience in my review that my expectations might have been too high, beyond the units performance level, which directly lead to my disappointment.I appreciate your gesture of the XX% discount. I don&rsquo;t feel right about returning a product that I have opened and used. I made the purchase, I opened the product and I used it therefore I will keep it. Respectfully, your willingness to give me a XX% discount is a kind gesture. I don&rsquo;t think is necessary, I willingly and fairly paid for your product at the listed price, opened it and used it, that&rsquo;s business. There appears to be nothing operationally wrong with the product, its new, it works, nothing appears to be defective and nothing appears to be broken. I am just disappointed in the picture quality that&rsquo;s all, the video review said you can &ldquo;expect to have a good picture&rdquo; and that its &ldquo;gonna look really, really good&rdquo; so that&rsquo;s what I was expecting.Thank you for your customer service and your managers gesture.&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; End of e-mail response dated 2/8/2017 &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;My experience with their customer service department was exceptional which in turn I came back and willingly change my review rating to a strong &ldquo;Four Stars&rdquo;READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-dbpower-mini-projector">Love this DBPOWER mini projector!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this projector for an outdoor movie screening event in my backyard. I couldn&rsquo;t have been more pleased with the picture quality, brightness and the sound (although I did decide to hook up my in-home surround sound system/blu ray player to it, which was super easy). I&rsquo;ve since connected my Ruko stick with the provided HDMI cable and streamed Netflix through the projector, attached my JBL bluetooth speaker with an AUX cable, and even used the HDMI to connect my MacBook so we could watch old home movies and flip through photos through the projector. One of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve made in years. Love this DBPOWER mini projector.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="nice-projector">nice projector.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Bought this as a backup for work and it works great for that, but I&rsquo;ve gotten more use out of it as an outdoor movie night/video game machine for the kids. It&rsquo;s bright enough to project on the side of my very dirty, kind of yellowish, barn at dusk and while I had an external speaker hooked up, the on board sound is loud enough to be used in a pinch. I used it on Halloween to project some animated faces on pumpkins and that was a big hit. I&rsquo;ve attached a video of the test I ran. It&rsquo;s already survived a bunch of bumps and knocks, warms up quickly, and is easy enough to use that a tech-challenged teenaged boy can set it up outdoors, in the dark, without texting his father for instructions. All in all its better than I thought it would be given the price, which was very inexpensive.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for 101 and some centsHeres my review, i switched from the white colored one to the black one because oddly one is at $120 where as the black one was at $101 and some cents.First and foremost the projector does work for what it advertises. My issue is just the fact that its to hard to see, and very very blurry. Reference photos, and videos to show quality in a office environment as well as just for giggles in close proximity.The Lumens are 1500, this is FAR to low for me to use this. Im use to 3000 lumen based projectors by Epson (Model H363A, and the H367).Ultimately i will be returning this, and spending the $300-500 on a more capable projector and associated mounts needed for the projector.Reference photo/videos will be uploaded during the 2nd edit, meaning sometime on 11/7/2017 or 11/8/2017Pros;- Cheap- Has a mount slot for Tripod (Instead of using the little stand use the tripod)Cons;- Blurry- Poor projecting quality at anything exceeding 30&rdquo;- Lacking depth- HDMI Port seems shoddy and easy to breakREAD MORE</p>
