<h5 id="get-it-right-now">GET IT RIGHT NOW.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I suffered listening to skipping CD&rsquo;s for so long in my aux-less 2007 Honda Accord. I didn&rsquo;t even realize a bluetooth FM speaker was an option until recently. Upgrade ASAP! This little baby connects to my iPhone as soon as I get in my car and I am notified by Batman&rsquo;s Alfred telling me so over my car speakers. You can almost never hear the radio static. Not only all of this, but it has an Aux cord port for when you don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of setting up the bluetooth on your friend&rsquo;s phone. And there are two USB charging ports so you can charge while you roll. And it&rsquo;s so affordable! Easily my best purchase in a long time.</p>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great until the plug fell apart after 2 months. Useless now.Edit. The manufacturer saw my one star review due to the plug falling apart. They contacted me a shipped a new one on their dime. It does work well and I give them a lot of credit for standing behind their product and making things right.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-so-happy-i-found-this">I am so happy I found this!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot express my love enough for this little gem. I have been making cd&rsquo;s to play in my car for YEARS. The last fm transmitter that I purchased years ago would intermittently not work, had a cord, and no screen. I have been through years of hell making cd&rsquo;s, guess what most new laptops dont even have cd drives anymore!!I stumbled upon this device on amazon which works via bluetooth (SCORE!!! no cord!) but also comes with a cord if you feel the need to not use bluetooth. I love this device so much.The sound is perfect!!! No stupid static in the background, and the quality of sound is better than a cd! (without the skipping too)You won&rsquo;t be sorry purchasing this and you will be bumpin tunes all over town.Everytime I get in my car it has a nice little voice that says &ldquo;waiting for pairing&rdquo; except I translate it as WAITING FOR PERRY so its name is Perry, and its my best friend :)PS: I have a 2006 Infiniti G35 that only had a cd player and the radio, no aux, and no bluetooth.</p>

<h5 id="great-design-great-sound-easy-to-use">Great design, great sound. Easy to use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little unit. Bluetooth pairing was simple. It came set to transmit to FM 108. My radio goes up to 107.9. Adjusted it easily without using directions. I&rsquo;m using an iPhone 4S. I don&rsquo;t have to use the included RCA-RCA jack, but you can use it with anything that has a standard RCA earphone/speaker jack. It plays micro SD cards too (though the directions call them something else). The sound is great. The controls are simple. I did finally read the directions to make sure I knew what all the buttons do. It&rsquo;s worth a read. The directions didn&rsquo;t mention this, but when it first powers up, it shows you the charge of your car battery. The USB outputs work well. I can control the volume on my iPhone, my car&rsquo;s sound system, or the unit itself (by twisting the knob with the phone icon). I can control the play/pause/ff/rwnd on the phone or the unit. Simply pushing the M(ode) key not only switches the source from bluetooth to cable to micro SD, it also shows clearly on the screen what mode you&rsquo;re in. It also shows what radio channel it&rsquo;s transmitting to. I haven&rsquo;t had it long, so I can&rsquo;t comment on its durability. I had a product years ago that was supposed to do this, but it was clunky and a pain to use, the sound quality was poor. This is a vast improvement on the old ones.</p>

<h5 id="good-unit-for-music-and-hands-free-calling">Good unit for music and hands-free calling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great unit. Workd well and once you have the station set, no adjustments are needed. One thing that i dont like about it is that th volume output of the transmitter does not match the volume of other radio stations or cd&rsquo;s, so when you switch, you have to remember to turn the radio volume down. The unit has a volume adjustment on it, and you can match the volume if you turn it all the way up, but anything that you are playing through the transmitter becomes distorted. The distortion is not an issue if the transmitter volume is turned down and main radio turned up. The hands free calling feature is great, i love it. The unit always pairs with my iphone, i have never had a pairing issue, and i have been using the unit for several months.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-let-the-four-stars-fool-you-still-a-great-purchase">Don&rsquo;t let the four stars fool you. Still a great purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I deliver packages for my job, so I use it eight hours a day. The sound quality is amazing, and I like all the different ways available to listen to your media, plus you can charge your phone while using gps. My unit developed air bubbles under the display which cannot be rubbed out. I had the end pop off but found the metal piece and plastic part and screwed it back together and it went back to working fine. There&rsquo;s just a few things that I think can be improved to make this a five star rating. The display is very bright at night, there should be a button on top to turn it off but still be able to listen. I don&rsquo;t like how the dial controls the sound, you have your radio volume and phone volume for that. Whenever I first pop it in it&rsquo;s at 26 or 19 and I need to turn it up. Instead, it should be used to fast forward/backtrack your song. I have been told that it&rsquo;s very hard to hear me when using it for calling but I think it&rsquo;s due to road noise from using a truck that is open with a cargo area. I&rsquo;m able to change it to just being able to be used for media through the bluetooth settings on samsung galaxy s7. Have not tried using it in conjunction with wireless earpiece yet. It does what I need it to and enjoy listening to podcasts while working. I can push the dial to pause what I&rsquo;m listening to, quickly get out, and pick up back where I left off, all without having to touch my phone. A great time saver. I bought this because I read about ones with the flexible neck breaking. It&rsquo;s still working great after 8 months of use. I would highly recommend it.</p>
