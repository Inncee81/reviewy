<h5 id="i-have-nothing-bad-to-say-about-this-camera">I have nothing bad to say about this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have nothing bad to say about this camera. The zoom is capable of bringing in a clear picture of a bird sized object at over 100 yards. The Wi-Fi is internal to the camera and works perfectly moving my pictures from the camera to my cell phone. A small downside to the Wi-Fi is that it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to set up, that said, it&rsquo;s really not that difficult and once in place it works perfectly, you do however, have to download the Nikon app onto your cell phone. I have gotten perfect photos without the flash in a darkened environment. The HD quality videos you can take with this camera are crisp and clear. The camera is lightweight, compact and is ready for use within a couple of seconds of turning it on. The camera has the capability of taking several photos one after another with almost no reload time between each photo. I looked at a lot of cameras, for the price this is certainly one of the best. If you&rsquo;re a professional photographer, I don&rsquo;t think I could suggest this for you. If you&rsquo;re like me, a person who likes to be able to take professional looking pictures without carrying around a load of attachments this is the camera for you.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-basic-digital-camera-with-decent-zoom">It&rsquo;s a basic digital camera with decent zoom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the Nikon L840 to replace my Canon SX-520HS for general photography. So I decided on this Nikon L840 camera.I have now had this Nikon camera for over a year and now can give a decent review on this Nikon camera.Pros: Nice 38X optical zoom lens, exposure controls, easy to use, great sized rubberized hand grip, nice tilt-out rear LCD view-finder, takes SD cards, uses 4 AA batteries, has really good battery life &amp; takes a pretty very good photo indoors [with flash] or outdoors in full daylight conditions.Cons: It feels so cheap with so much plastic, the auto focus sometimes is a bit slow, cumbersome menu system &amp; no mode wheel on top of the camera since there are very few manual settings this camera can do.Overall photo quality seems quite good with this camera. Indoor photo quality with flash &amp; outdoor photo quality in full daylight are actually quite good for me. Taking photos in low-light conditions is a bit harder with this camera &amp; photo quality drops considerably unless you use the flash, but none of my digital cameras really never took a halfway decent low-light photo anyways. Digital video quality is great. It has wi-fi for those that use it. Overall, I am very fairly pleased with the photo &amp; video quality this digital camera produces.I have had similar Nikon &ldquo;P series&rdquo; digital cameras including Nikon P-500, P-510 and a P-520 and this L-840 from Nikon compares better against the P-500 and P-510 and equals the P-520 in photo qualities. I am rather pleased overall with this Nikon camera.If you need a fairly basic, larger, inexpensive digital camera with a decent-sized zoom that takes pretty good photos &amp; fairly easy to use, I think this Nikon digital camera is about the best you can find in the price range and compares very favorably to similar Canon digital cameras including the SX-510HS [30X optical zoom] and SX-520HS [42X optical zoom] in photo qualities. I gave this Nikon digital camera 5 of 5 stars because I simply think it&rsquo;s a great basic super-zoom bridge digital camera.UPDATE: I have now had this Nikon L-840 for over 7 months &amp; overall photos are pretty good still, no change there. Indoor photos are still very good and really a periodic issue with the &ldquo;freezing up&rdquo; of the camera and me removing and reinserting the 4 AA batteries once in a great while is the only problem that has popped up. No other issues and the camera is still working pretty good. I kept the rating at 5 stars because nothing serious has happened yet with this camera for me.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-have-used-for-a-week-on-a-vacation">So far so good. Have used for a week on a vacation &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. Have used for a week on a vacation and most all pictures turned out great, even the super zoomed in pics. I keep looking at the P610 thinking I should have gotten it, with the better zoom, viewfinder, and manual mode, but for the money and for the average camera user, this model should be fine. And for the first person who reviewed this with 4 stars because &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t come with the case&rdquo;, that is an absurd reason to lower your rating. This comes with a case if you buy the bundle. Try reading the descriptions next time.</p>

<h5 id="great-pics">Great pics</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera has exceeded expectations and the zoom is exceptional</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice camera. It is heavy duty and durable. Very well made. It is easy to use and works great. It comes with the cord and neck strap. It takes clear pictures. The zoom on it is perfect. Very fast shipping</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-great-subcompact-camera">It&rsquo;s a great subcompact camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great subcompact camera. I didn&rsquo;t realize you have to use AA batteries in it but it came with them and I haven&rsquo;t had to change them since getting it. The pictures are beautiufl and you can get some serious zoom out of it. It is bulkier than your tradional compact camera but I didn&rsquo;t have to carry multiple lenses with me which makes packing a breeze!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-aren-t-too-terrible-for-a-person-of-my-ability">They aren&rsquo;t too terrible for a person of my ability</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not an expert photographer. But the two attached photos are unretouched as-is from the camera. They aren&rsquo;t too terrible for a person of my ability. Both were taken with max physical zoom no tripod, mostly default settings.Takes four AA batteries - really easy to get replacements or replace on the fly, so if you need a camera you can have ready at any time, this is a good choice. No charge time or unusual battery formats.No problem with SD cards - 32 gig card handles a good number of pictures at decent resolution, easy to get multiple 32 gig SD cards these days.Controls don&rsquo;t interfere with use too much, multiple ways to zoom. Managed to get a really good shot of the full moon at night using the 38x optical zoom with no tripod.Definitely not for action shots, indoor shots with clutter, zoom with clutter, or anything where you are shooting through a transparent surface. Otherwise, it is reasonable in full daylight or outdoor light with auto focus. Beware, it will on occasion &ldquo;give up&rdquo; on trying to focus on anything in particular and give you a little red reticle before taking the photograph anyway. There is no option for manual focus or adjusting focus on your own - you have to leave it to the camera. Again, outdoor, no clutter, works fine. Indoor with clutter or anything else where you zoom with low light - nope.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty good for photos but wouldn&rsquo;t recommend using for videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-me">Not for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes great pictures.. but.. sometimes I can download pictures on my pc and most times not.. doing it all the same each time. Yes my WiFi is hooked up..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="starter-camera">Starter camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for beginners getting into DSLR. Zoom is great. Does poor in lowlight. Slow shutter speed. Decent price for what you get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bummer-blurry-pics">Bummer&hellip; blurry pics!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seemed impossible to take a picture that didn&rsquo;t have blurr. For the money my iPhone takes better photographs. I returned it! Hoping to save the money and just get a DSLR.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very cool camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-i-get-a-lemon">Did I get a lemon?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first got the camera it was amazing, the shots I took of the moon look like NASA quality, but then I started having some serious issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this s for years and do not regret the purchase.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>
