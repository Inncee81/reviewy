<li>Supports voice and 3G data for 3G/4G/LTE mobile phones, including iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc.</li>
<li>Simple setup process using quick setup guide - Note that you must have an official AT&amp;T account (not a 3rd-party carrier)</li>
<li>Status Indicators: Cell Signal, GPS Signal, Internet Connectivity, Power</li>
<li>Works at home or the office (broadband internet connection via Ethernet is required) Note that satellite internet connections often have too much delay for this device to work properly</li>

</ul>

<p>This AT&amp;T Microcell is built by Cisco Systems, a leader in cellular network technology. It can provide up to 5 bars of AT&amp;T cell signal to your 3G and 4G mobile phones (including iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc). Setup is quick and easy - just follow the 10-minute setup in the included &ldquo;quick-start&rdquo; guide and it will be up and running typically within 2 hours of setup. Note that this device requires internet connectivity through a wired Ethernet connection (cable is included). Most wired and wireless routers include 4 or more of these ports. Also requires installation close enough to a window to receive GPS signals for use during emergency (911) calls. Highly secure device that cannot be accessed by unauthorized users. Supports up to four voice or data users simultaneously.</p>

<h5 id="wow-a-cell-phone-extender-that-actually-works-without-having-to-install-antennea-s-or-drill-holes-simple-easy">Wow a cell phone extender that actually works without having to install antennea&rsquo;s or drill holes. Simple &amp; easy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is for ATT wireless users that have low or no ATT cellular signal strength and have broadband internet connection. Here is how it works:Plug in the electrical connection, plug in a network cable to your home network. Go to the ATT website included with the device, logon to your wireless ATT account or create one if you don&rsquo;t have one attached to your phone, enter in the serial number of the Microcell, add all the ATT cellphone numbers that will be using the device, press enter, within 90 minutes you will be up and running, (mine took 20 minutes). I can now go anywhere in my 2300 square foot home. I work from home and taking calls in the basement was always hit or miss, mostly miss, now there are no issues whatsoever I can go anywhere in my home to make or receive calls and text. Basically this just routes all your calls via the internet when you are connected to the Microcell, your calls actually sound better too and they don&rsquo;t have the latency with normal cell traffic.</p>

<h5 id="this-at-t-microcell-booster-is-working-as-expected-we">This AT&amp;T Microcell Booster is working as expected. We &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This AT&amp;T Microcell Booster is working as expected. We now have 5-bar signal strength coverage in and around our residence, instead of the 1-bar signal strength provided by the local cell tower.I ordered this unit after receiving a defective (non-working ) AT&amp;T 3G Microcell Wireless Cellular Signal Booster from Amazon, Sold by Bay Walk Gifts. I will never, never, never purchase again from Bay Walk Gifts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-product-really-works">This product REALLY works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product REALLY works! Prior to purchasing it, be sure to check on the ATT MicroCell website to assure your residence/business is in area that is covered. I currently have an Iphone 5. After having 3 to 4 bars of signal at my house for years, my coverage dropped to 0 to 1 bar. At first I thought maybe they were working on a tower, but after 6 frustrating weeks I decided to give this product a try. I now have between 4 and 5 bars of signal. I get a strong signal throughout my house (2000 square feet) and in the full basement and attic. It was easy to set-up and I consider myself technologically challenged. I purchased this through Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="wow">wow!!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow&hellip;&hellip;I am very happy. I have been looking at this for a long time. If I rock in my lazy-boy while talking my voice cuts off&hellip;very annoying and many times have to walk out of the house into the street. I broke down and bought an AT&amp;T Microcell and could not be more happy. I have a Galaxy, my wife and daughter have an Apple and my mom has a cheap who knows what it is. The common denominator was all AT&amp;T and all had one bar of reception. I ordered it new from Amazon Prime Wednesday evening. Friday morning it was delivered to my door. The seller even typed a &ldquo;helpful hints&rdquo; instruction page.a couple hours later had five bars on everyone&rsquo;s phone. No more bad reception, breaking up or dropped calls. I should have done this a long time ago. I did just call AT&amp;T to activate instead of Internet. They only took a minuet and were fantastic. I am very happy.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-set-up-using-the-instruction-sheet-provided-by">Easy to set up using the instruction sheet provided by &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We had a model DPH-151 that was on <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for several years. It died one day. Ordered this new model DPH-154. Easy to set up using the instruction sheet provided by R.A. Quality Seller (although I did double check the official Quick Startup Guide). Seems to have a stronger signal than the old one (5 bars rather than 4 bars where I usually leave our phone). We use our cell phone as our home phone through a Panasonic KX-TGE275S 5-Cordless Handsets Link2Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone system. Outdoors we can almost reliably get 1, maybe 1½, bars at some points around the yard. We are fortunate in our rural area to have Comcast Xfinity cable high speed internet. But for backup I use a zBoost ZB575-A TRIO SOHO Tri Band AT&amp;T 4G Cell Phone Signal Booster which is placed in the same room as the cell phone (Amazon Fire Phone) giving barely 2 bars. When the internet goes down, the phone automatically switches to the Booster signal. The combination gives us a reliable home phone. It did take some time a few years ago to figure how to make all this work in our house which is full of various wireless device signals.</p>

<h5 id="i-wouldn-t-recommend-it-but-if-you-have-to-have-it-go-through-at-t">I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it, but if you HAVE to have it, go through AT&amp;T.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The microcell was very tricky to get working correctly, it couldn&rsquo;t get reception aside from 1 spot in my house. Once I finally got it set up, it did improve reception across the board, but outside where we still picked up the microcell, browsing speed was much slower than it was without it.Then, a few months later, the microcell stopped working. The microcell serial number came up as invalid, and our 3 phones showed to never be registered to one.After a lot of chats and calls with AT&amp;T, the best answer they could come up with was that the original buyer reported it stolen, but I doubt it. After doing more research, apparently these just stop working and you have to return/replace them through AT&amp;T.</p>

<h5 id="difficult-install-lack-of-gps-antenna-plug-is-a-huge-downside-that-makes-setup-difficult">Difficult install, lack of GPS antenna plug is a huge downside that makes setup difficult.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very difficult to get this guy going, but it eventually worked after fiddling around with my router settings. Please note that you <em>cannot</em> open up the unit without triggering a mechanism that permanently disables the unit. Also, it&rsquo;s really disappointing that they removed the GPS antenna plug from this model - this was a nice feature that made it easier to set up the unit. Without it, you need to place the item within view of a window when you&rsquo;re waiting for it to start working - if your router is in a difficult spot like a basement, you may be completely out of luck!</p>

<h5 id="cannot-send-or-receive-texts-reliably-don-t-waste-your-money">Cannot send or receive texts reliably. Don&rsquo;t waste your money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had this since <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>. Easy setup and 5 bars throughout the house. However, it wouldnt allow texts to go through. We have Android phones. Called AT&amp;T who said our phones needed 4g to text. With a bit of research I found that it would work right by disabling a setting requiring a HD voice signal. Worked for awhile, but now it will refuse to send texts unless you reboot the microcell AND your phone. This is probably going to end up in the trash.Update, <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. After many attempts, texts just will not go through. It&rsquo;s now in the trash. If you have an Android, don&rsquo;t waste your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-good-at-all">Not good at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased one of these through ATT. All it does is duplicate WiFi calling. It does not help with dropped calls, and you cannot group text.Do not waste your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-the-old-one">Better than the old one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works much much better than the older microcell from Cisco / AT&amp;T. This one is quite reliable for us.</p>

<p>I got it in August and it stopped working in April. AT&amp;T has them for $150.</p>
