<h5 id="best-thing-since-sliced-bread">Best thing since sliced bread.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is now my go to curling iron, I use it every time I curl my hair. I normally just flip the ends of my hair and this is the perfect thing for it. I use the flat iron at the top of my hair and then as I get close to the end I start turning it so the hair goes around the outside. I works perfectly. My hair stays curled all day and it is so easy. The top is straight and the ends are flipped. The best of both worlds. The flat iron doesn&rsquo;t rip out my hair like some that I have had it the past. I just love this thing.</p>

<h5 id="the-quality-of-the-product-exceeded-my-expectations-and-i-loved-how-it-made-my-hair-look-gave-my">The quality of the product exceeded my expectations and I LOVED how it made my hair look - gave my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE IT YOU HAVE LONG HAIR! The quality of the product exceeded my expectations and I LOVED how it made my hair look - gave my hair a soft, romantic, long-lasting curl that I could run my fingers through. However, on 2 separate occasions when curling a section in the back, the iron got horribly tangled in my hair, to there point where I couldn&rsquo;t move it. I had to unplug it and was in a panic that it was going to burn the whole section of hair off completely. The first time I thought it was user error that could be avoided if I was more careful. But a few weeks later, it happened a second time, and it took me a full half hour to untangle the hair from the iron, causing a lot of breakage. I honestly thought I was going to have to cut my hair off at the root to get it out. Lesson learned, never again! If the bristles were flexible, or there was some kind of safety feature where you could pop the end off and slide the rows of bristles out I would have kept it, but otherwise this thing is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<h5 id="impressed">Impressed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have only tried 1 other combination flat iron before for hair straightening before purchasing this one (the inStyler). However I am glad that I came across this one amazon and read the helpful reviews. The packaging was premium overall in design and resourcefulness with this flat iron. I especially appreciate the zip up case with the aluminum lined interior that allows me to be able to have a heat safe place to sit and store this combination flat iron while in use and after use. The heated strastraighten brush works on my blow dryed 3c textured hair very impressively to the point where I honestly didn&rsquo;t need to use the flat ironing plates to further straighten my hair. However I chose to straighten the other side of my hair with the flat iron plates to test out how well the plates work. Very smooth and sleek feel for straightening which took some getting used to at first start in using this flat iron because the plates are so sleek compared to the dull plates of my regular gold n hot flat iron . Both the brush and plates straighten well and leave a nice shine/sheen to my hair. So I am super pleased. Quick and efficient. I feel this combination flat iron is healthy for heat styling my hair as well unlike some heat styling products. Temperature settings start at 300 and is maximum 410 degrees F. I used the max setting of 410 the entire time. This flat iron and heated brush does automatically cut off if idle for safety. So I did have to turn it back on when I returned back to the room after a nice absence of 15-20 minutes or so. Both brush and plates get very hot on the hair for proper straightening but won&rsquo;t be a threat of accidental burns or burning the hair with heat damage from what I can tell so far. Wven with knowing this still make sure to treat your hair with respect and don&rsquo;t abuse this product because it does get hot. LOL I will be honest that it&rsquo;s not as easy to curl my hair with like a regular/singular flat iron but I did manage to get some type of curl with much persistence and effort. I think it will take more practice to ace or I may just have to be happy that this flat iron/heated brush at least is great for straightening my hair but still will likely need to use my regular flat iron for curling. Great price as well. This is a pure honest review. I didn&rsquo;t get any discounts on this product nor did I get this product for free (I wish I did though! LOL).</p>

<h5 id="neat-idea">Neat idea!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty neat styler. It ranges from 300 - 410 degrees. It heats up very quickly and works well. It brushes my hair while straightening, so it does add some volume. I like that it comes in a bag for easy travel. It also locks closed, which is nice so I can lock it when I&rsquo;m finished and not worry about the cats getting burned if they jump on the counter.</p>

<h5 id="another-great-xtava-product">Another great Xtava product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How great is it to have a 3 in 1 styler? I&rsquo;ll tell you, it is AMAZING! I love that I can both straighten and somewhat curl my hair at the same time! Now if this could cook dinner, I would have it made! ;) I love that I can choose the temperature setting and that there is automatic shutoff. I am always afraid I am going to leave something on when I am in a rush in the morning, but even if I did (which I don&rsquo;t recommend making a habit of!) it will shut itself down after an hour. The case it comes in is pretty great also - because if it is still hot, you can throw it in the case and go! I have been using this tool to give my hair more volume and with the assistance of some hair products, it is doing what it promised!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-favorite">My favorite!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own many Xtava products and I honestly love them all but I think I love this one the most. The versatility of this 3 in 1 styler is amazing. It makes me think of my Grandmothers pink round styling brush that I grew up watching her use. I can tell you that this is NOT your Grandmas old curling brush&hellip;it&rsquo;s much better. I really like that I&rsquo;m able to achieve so many different styles with one tool. Admittedly sometimes it&rsquo;s by accident sometimes, the brush part does take a little getting used to..or at least it did for me because I&rsquo;m accustomed to using a flat iron or wand but don&rsquo;t let that discourage you. With this styler you can straighten, curl, half curl and flip with ease. It comes with every option to fit any need. The temperature is adjustable, the cord is very long and it swivels! The wand locks so that you can strictly use the brush part if you prefer, that really helps to prevent tangles. The results are amazing. I&rsquo;ve had some of my most complimented hair days because of this tool and it&rsquo;s so easy. The fancy storage box and thermal pouch are very nice perks as well. Thank you Xtava! My hair loves you too!</p>
