<blockquote>
<p>I own a pair of Shure headphones, and I don&rsquo;t really think you can go &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with either these or the Shure tips. However, I would definitely purchase these first because:-They are a little more comfortable in the ear-They are easier to get a perfect seal with-The wax-guard is fantastic (think&hellip; no more need to clean out the grossness deep inside of your canalphones)-They will make your headphones sound better (mostly as a result of the previous three reasons)Now, to answer the questions I myself have had at some point:-The foam is a little different than the kind Shure uses. It seems to be a little firmer&hellip; until it is placed in the ear, where it feels softer and a little more comfortable. It&rsquo;s also slightly more resistant to wax in my experience, and is a quality product that can withstand daily use.-They aren&rsquo;t tricky to apply. I was worried that the fit on the headphones themselves would be too tight or too loose (the former being annoying and the latter literally making the foams useless). I can only speak for SE Models, but the fit was perfect for me. The build is a tad different, as the foams feature a slightly thinner and flexible core tube&hellip; but this doesn&rsquo;t really change the ease of applying them in comparison to the Shures.-For Shure owners: the &ldquo;one size&rdquo; of these roughly equates to the medium Shure size&hellip; they are themselves a tiny bit smaller than a medium Shure foam, but it is very close. I will say this&hellip; I wore the mediums AND larges for my Shures (mediums preferred), and the smalls wouldn&rsquo;t fit quite right&hellip; but these create the best seal by far that I have experienced with any IEM tip. If you are hesitant about the fit, go to the Comply website. They have three different sizes for all of their models.-For non-Shure/non-foam users: soft foam is generally better than flex tips/silicone/hard foam, but it depends on your ears and your preferences. For most, it is the best blend of comfort and sound quality. The foam (if fitted correctly) is not painful on the ear at all after prolonged use and will not cause headaches. The fit is crucial in getting good sound, just like pretty much any other tip. If the build quality is good (like these), there is little to no change in frequency response in comparison to silicone.-The sound quality with these is better than with other foams, and this is why- they are designed to give a better fit and keep wax out, allowing earphones to stream more pristine audio as a result. Earphones with these tips will sound more &ldquo;open&rdquo; and clear, and even the discerning ear will probably notice a wider soundstage with their current headphones.-Sound isolation is close to most foams, but a little better (for me) because they seal so well. For users who want premier sound isolation, these will suit your needs very well.-The 2dB of transmission loss with the wax guard is virtually a non-issue, especially since ear wax within the audio canal is much more detrimental to sound quality than anything else.Overall, I do not hesitate to give these a five star rating. If you are interested in these or are even on the fence, I would stop reading this review right now, place them in my cart, and checkout. Happy listening!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate the standard sililcone tips that come with most earbuds.They are the wrong size, don&rsquo;t really form to your ear, are flimsy and tend to rip if used too much. (At very least that&rsquo;s been my experience over the years).When I found these tips I was blown away.By making a better seal in your ear the sound quality jumps up a ton.Rich lows, crisp highs, I&rsquo;m hearing pieces of the music that I simply can&rsquo;t with standard tips.Now I can&rsquo;t say how a pair of these tips on a pair of $10 buds stack up against super high-end buds, but frankly, if you&rsquo;re a true audiophile, are you turning to buds for that sound reproduction you need? (Maybe&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know your life.)What I can say though, is that these make my listening experience in the gym a million times more pleasant.Beyond the added benefit of making the music sound better, they dampen all the nonsense garbage noise in the gym (or other environment) really well.They may not qualify as &lsquo;noise cancelling&rsquo; but they do a hell of a good job muffling out the inane chit-chat of people wherever I go.</p>

<h5 id="foam-tips-for-blissful-listening">Foam Tips for blissful listening</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had a mid-range pair of Kicker earbuds that have always sounded great to me, but over a few years of ownership the original rubber tips were tearing and just falling apart. I&rsquo;d been keeping an eye on the Comply foam tips for a while now, but never pulled the trigger. It wasn&rsquo;t until I finally lost one of the rubber tips that I decided to pick up a pack.I am using the medium sized tip, and these have breathed new life into what I thought was already a decent set. I can hear so much more from the earbuds than I ever could before. The passive noise cancelling is decent. Not enough to drown out everything around, but enough to dull it so I can&rsquo;t hear other people conversations in an office environment.As far as comfort, these are awesome. I wear them for an entire 8 hour workday with no sense of pain or unease at all. I would highly recommend to anyone that needs a new set of tips to try these out. I am pretty sure you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="comfortable-and-good-replacement-tip">Comfortable and good replacement tip.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I currently have them on a DUNU-1k headphones as my daily driver. I have purchased the Isolation Plus Tx-500 tips and been using them for a few months now. The first pair have used lasted some time. Although I do not use them everyday, maybe 3 or 4 times per week. One of the tips ripped on me after 4 months. This was to be expected as I was trying to get a good seal and forcing it into my ear. I probably should have went with a small size.Pros:The filters are excellent and do a great job of keeping anything from touching the headphones.The feel of the tips is excellent very comfortable.The don&rsquo;t fall out even when using them in the gym.Cons:The only con I can really say is the price. They are pretty expensive at the current rate I will be buying a new set in less then a year. This comes with having an excellent experience. So as cons go its more of neutral issue.</p>

<p>Says it fits Motorola but if you own the Motorolla Surround Black and Blue around neck headphones these tips come off every time you remove the headphones from your ears&hellip;. You&rsquo;ve been warned&hellip;. They work with these headphones and do remove sound but when you take the headphones out of your ears&hellip;. they will come off and be stuck in your ears&hellip;Found out although not listed these fit Anker Soundbuds Life wireless around neck headphones and dont come off when you remove them and make them sound even better with the isolation of sound.I use these on a motorcycle and they work great. You can hear just fine just good for your ears as you should be wearing earplugs this way you get music too.</p>
