<h5 id="nice-and-smooth-mouse-good-job-logitecn">Nice and smooth mouse, good job logitecn</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse is great. I have a Windows 10 tablet that I like to use a mouse with when I&rsquo;m working on it. I was using a mouse with a USB plug before this, but the tablet requires and adapter to use a regular size usb and I could not charge the tablet at the same time I was using the USB mouse. This bluetooth mouse was super easy to pair to the windows tablet (Bluetooth settings, click connect on discover-able mouse). It automatically connects back up when the mouse and PC are both turned back on, and i think it goes to sleep a little to save battery when left idle (have to click, move around sometimes after being idle too long). It is a nice size and fits easily in my purse with my tablet. I have a &lsquo;mini&rsquo; mouse for my desktop at work, and this M557 is only about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; longer than that, fits perfectly in my hand. It does take two AA batteries (my other mouse takes only 1, maybe is the bluetooth signal that uses more juice), the 2 AA batteries make it a little heavier than my other wireless mouse but its not a deal-breaker. There is no blinding blue light on the bottom of the mouse, which is nice. The Windows button works on Windows 10 to bring up your start menu, pretty cool. The scroll wheel is very smooth and not loud. Mouse clicks are slightly louder than my other mouse, but not a deal-breaker. Go ahead and click yes if my review helped you. :)</p>

<h5 id="i-m-trying-to-find-the-best-bluetooth-mouse-for-me">I&rsquo;m trying to find the best bluetooth mouse for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find the best bluetooth mouse for me. So far I have tried Apple&rsquo;s magic mouse ($69) and Microsoft&rsquo;s bluetooth sculpt mouse ($20).Let me start off by a brief review of these other mice first:Apple&rsquo;s Magic Mouse - incredibly versatile mouse. With the addition of apps like BetterTouchtool, it is almost infinitely configurable with custom gestures, taps, etc. And the smooth scrolling was awesome. It also looked nice, but I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned about that in a mouse. The problem with it was it was so thin, and in order to use the touch gestures, you have to hover your hand above the mouse instead of resting on it. Both of these issues combined cause my hand to cramp up like crazy. So I decided to return it.Microsoft sculpt bluetooth mouse - after looking at all the other bluetooth mice I could find, I decided to try this next. The shape is very comfortable to hold, and has an extra &ldquo;windows&rdquo; button near the thumb that is configurable to press and swipe up/down. Unfortunately, this button is NOT configurable in OS X. I spent a while looking for an app that would detect it and configure, but was unable to find one. Still, it was cheap and comfortable, so i decided to keep it for my desktop at home, which I rarely ever sit at locally.That brings me to this Logitech. It is not as versatile as Apple&rsquo;s Magic mouse, but it is way more comfortable. And unlike microsoft&rsquo;s sculpt mouse, there <em>is</em> driver software for Mac. With it, you can reprogram the scroll/tilt wheel and middle button as you wish. It is more expensive than the sculpt, but the OS X support was worth the extra $10 to me.In conclusion, I would say if you&rsquo;re looking for a nice cheap bluetooth mouse for windows, go with microsoft&rsquo;s sculpt instead. It is cheaper at $20, just as comfortable, and the side windows button is more versatile than the center button on this logitech. BUT if you want a mouse primarily for mac, and like me you don&rsquo;t care for the magic mouse, this is the one to get.</p>

<h5 id="very-well-done">Very well done</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice mouse &ndash; installs on Win7Pro by simply turning it on near the computer, and has (so far) a very strong connection (no dropped Bluetooth signals, at least yet). For me it is a bit small, but portability makes up for that. There is a neat Windows Start button, which (in Win7) launches the Start menu (it works differently in Win8). To move back and forward between a page, one tilts the scroll to the left or right, an intuitive gesture. I prefer buttons on the left side of the mouse (as is the case with other Logitech mouses, and also other mouse brands), but the scroll wheel operates well and this is a preference and not a deal breaker. The major issue is that there are no dropped signals. One other comment: This mouse comes in a clamshell, but somehow &ndash; miraculously &ndash; Logitech managed to avoid the typical problem with clamshells (impossible to open) by perforating the back of the clamshell. Why other manufacturers can&rsquo;t imitate this is beyond me.</p>

<h5 id="couldn-t-get-it-to-work-reliably-for-me">Couldn&rsquo;t get it to work reliably for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Logitech Bluetooth mouse that I use currently (the T-631) &amp; it works pretty well. Every now &amp; then it stops working &amp; I have to wait for it to reconnect to my Mac&rsquo;s bluetooth, but overall it works well. I saw this bluetooth mouse with 1 year battery life (my T-631 only lasts about a week) and bought it. Something works differently with this one, as it continually messes up my bluetooth. The entire time I tried it, my bluetooth kept &lsquo;locking up&rdquo; &amp; all bluetooth peripherals would stop working. I&rsquo;d have to restart the Mac to get them back. Also, when I tried to pair this to my Mac, it popped up as a keyboard &amp; my computer kept asking me to push the button next to the spacebar, which obviously doesn&rsquo;t exist on a mouse.</p>

<p>Too good to be true. Very laggy connection to computer, but good alternative when you don&rsquo;t have enough USB ports. Bluetooth will occasionally interfere with other devices.</p>

<p>This is a great mouse alternative to the stock Apple mouse. You can download Logitech software and add gestures to each button to mimic the functions on an Apple mouse.</p>
