<h5 id="tilts-forward-on-65-tv">Tilts forward on 65&rsquo; TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We installed this mount with a 65 inch Vizio and no matter what it tilted forward. We fixed by inserting a pencil between the tv and the bottom of the bracket on each side.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-ok-tv-mount-but-i-feel-there-are-better-options-on-the-market">An OK TV mount but I feel there are better options on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Black, TV wall mount bracket with articulating arms. This product accommodates most 20&rdquo; - 65&rdquo; TVs and holds up to 115 lbs. The mount allows for up to a 130° swivel and 10° tilt, and the arm can extend up to 14&rdquo; from the wall and is ~3&rdquo; when collapsed. The mount also comes with a 10&rsquo; HDMI cable, 6&rdquo; 3 axis magnetic bubble level, and all mounting hardware.We use this mount with our 42&rdquo; TV. Installation is not too difficult but does require the use of tools. I like that this product is very sturdy and stable. However, this mount doesn&rsquo;t have a very low profile and juts out from the wall a bit. It is also difficult to clean and get into all of the mount&rsquo;s nooks and crevices. I also have difficulty pushing the mount back into place (flush with the wall) after having the arms extended forward, as one arm (or the other) tends to inevitably go to the left or right instead of straight and center. In addition, as others have mentioned, the mount does make the TV tip forward slightly - doesn&rsquo;t bother us too much, but the degree of tilt may be more drastic with larger and/or heavier TVs.An OK TV mount but I feel there are better options on the market.</p>

<h5 id="strong-mount">Strong Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving the two mounts, I noticed that it came with a lot more than I thought. There are quite a bit of extra TV screws, small level, LED keychain light, braided HDMI cord, and velcro ties. The mount itself feels very strong and sturdy; although many people say it&rsquo;s hard to pull/turn the mount, it isn&rsquo;t hard to do once the tv is mounted to it.I ordered this mount without measuring my studs, and was disappointed in finding out that my studs were 24&rdquo; apart. Luckily, we had enough SnapToggles to do the job (each hold about 250lbs) and it turned out great.It does have the slight tilt, but I&rsquo;m using its max size TV at 65&rdquo; so I was ready for it to do it.The one complaint I do have is the &ldquo;safety screws&rdquo; or set screws that hold the tv onto the mount, aren&rsquo;t in the best location for a 65&rdquo;, as they are right on the outer screw heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kit-was-nicely-packaged-and-so-far-so-good">Kit was nicely packaged and so far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Half the price of competitors products at local shops in the area. Kit was nicely packaged and so far so good. I gave it 4 stars just because I wish the brackets that that rest on the actual wall mount, They are made off thin flimsy stamped metal that can be easily bent. I almost returned it for that reason but really wanted to get the TV mounted so gave it a shot. Seems to hold up fine and I don&rsquo;t ever move the TV anyways. I do like the fact that this came with a nice braided HDMI cable as well as a level to aid in mounting.</p>

<h5 id="nice-inexpensive-mount">Nice Inexpensive Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 55&rdquo; Sony Bravia LED TV that has a Gorilla Glass front. Since the glass is very strong the TV does not require a frame. This allows the TV to be very thin. The front and the back of the TV are also completely flat. My existing mount is stationary and does not have any tilt, swivel, or rotation features. It also hangs the TV very close to the wall similar to a picture frame. I was looking for a inexpensive adjustable mount with the ability to pull the TV away from the wall and the ability to tilt forward.Pros:* Sturdy - Holds my 50.9 lbs. TV without issue. I have no worries the TV will fall or the mount will bend. Box says it can hold up to 115 lbs.* Can pull out/push in, rotate left and right, slide left and right, swing left and right, and tilt.* Comes with all necessary hardware and screws.* Easy to read and follow instructions included.* Two different types of bubble levels are included for leveling the mount.* Box included several free items (6&rdquo; Axis Bubble Level, Micro Fiber Cleaning Cloth, LED Keychain Light, and a High Speed 10&rsquo; HDMI cable with Ethernet.)Cons:* One corner of the mount where it attaches to the wall was damaged (bent). However, the damage was not severe or noticeable once the TV was mounted. It also did not compromise the structural integrity of the mount so I did not need to return it.* The mount tilts forward a few inches by default when it is in the upright position. This will be annoying for those who want their TV flush with the wall. Other reviewers have stated that they had to shim the mount to prevent the tilt. I believe one reviewer used a pencil.In regards to the CON mentioned above about the tilt issue. My TV is mounted a little to high on my wall. It&rsquo;s not so much that I mounted it too high, it&rsquo;s just the size of my wall and the size of the TV that determined the placement. My TV looks pretty good for multiple viewing angles, but once I mounted the TV on the new mount and viewed it with the tilt, I could not believe how much the picture improved.</p>

<h5 id="great-but-install-with-care-planning">Great! But install with care/planning</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two mount, a flush mount and this articulating mount for my 65&rdquo; LG 4K. I installed the flush mount first but switched immediately because the flush mount was too difficult to add/switch cables (hdmi, optical audio&hellip;).This articulating mount is better than my other Cheeta articulating mount because this one was already one piece while my other came in pieces that I had to put the entire thing together. This alone warrants a 5 star!!!It was super easy to install and took me less than 5 minutes to install.The issue I have is that my tv now tilts forward too far. The screws that lock it to the mount and hold it from tilting are now bending due to the weight of the TV. I possibly could (and should) have installed the mounting brackets much higher so the weight of the tv is hanging down vs hold up on the bracket. This would require a higher mounting of the base which wouldn&rsquo;t have been an issue on my wall.Pros:One piece baseEasy installationGood range of motionCons:Mounting base installed much higher on wallAdjusting screws are weak and bend easyI would buy this again but install it differently.</p>
