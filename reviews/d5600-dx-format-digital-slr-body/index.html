<h5 id="consider-buying-a-d5500-instead">Consider buying a D5500 instead</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this camera (with the 18-55mm VR kit lens) from Amazon in order to replace a much-loved D5100 that was stolen. The camera has all the plusses I loved in the D5100, especially its light weight and reticulating LCD. In addition, the basic D5600 kit now includes the much-improved 18-55mm VR AF-P lens, which is incredibly sharp and useful. Focus is now adjustable by touching the focus ring on the lens rather than flipping a switch. And the LCD, like the competing Canons, has touch-screen capabilities, making use of the menus far easier (and faster). I compared the D5600 to a D7200, the flagship of Nikon&rsquo;s DX offerings, and found, quite simply, that I took much better photographs with the D5600. The size and weight of the D7200 militated against spontaneity in my shooting. Admittedly, I would have gotten used to this in time, but even so, the D5600, to me, offered all the crucial flexibilities of the D7200 in a far more user-friendly, approachable context. I found it far easier to shoot the D5600 in aperture-priority (A), shutter-priority (S), and manual mode (M). To be sure, you don&rsquo;t have two dials, but the single D5600 dial can control both shutter and aperture simply by holding down a button. The bottom line was the D5600&rsquo;s featherweight construction. I&rsquo;m a huge believer in the adage, &ldquo;the camera you have with you is the one you will use.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s face it: the competition is the iPhone&rsquo;s camera, and I&rsquo;ve taken a hell of a lot of great photographs with it. The D5600 is light enough to make you stop and consider lugging it with you, iPhone and all.I&rsquo;m less than enthusiastic about the single major improvement over the D5600&rsquo;s predecessor, the D5500: Snapbridge. The low-power Bluetooth connection is capable, as I ascertained, at transferring large format images to my iPhone 6S, but the transfer is inordinately slow and consumes battery power voraciously. Although the camera still has wi-fi, like its predecessor, wi-fi is now wholly subordinated within Snapbridge, such that the user cannot choose between Bluetooth and wi-fi. There is one positive: So long as you have your smartphone with you, the Bluetooth transfers can be configured to encode your pictures&rsquo; GPS coordinates, but there&rsquo;s a major downside to this: If the pairing doesn&rsquo;t happen for some reason, and the transfer happens elsewhere, the coordinates will be wrong.I regret to say that I pulled out my D5100&rsquo;s EyeFi card and plan to use it instead of Snapbridge to transfer full-size images to my smartphone; in my experience, at least, it&rsquo;s 10x faster. Or better, I&rsquo;ll simply pull the SD card out of the camera and stick into the slot on my MacBook Air. The unfortunate truth is that the D5600 offers very little in comparison with its predecessor, the D5500, and buyers might well consider saving $100 by foregoing the most recent version of this camera.This year marks Nikon&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, and for me personally, the 40th year I&rsquo;ve owned and photographed with Nikon products. It is with sadness that I note signs of Nikon&rsquo;s desperation in the face of smartphone competition. In order to cut costs, evidently, this camera kit does not include the camera&rsquo;s reference manual, an indispensable item for serious photographers, and it isn&rsquo;t available on Nikon USA&rsquo;s site, at this writing. Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer to have a printed manual rather than a 300-page PDF.In spite of my criticisms, I must say that I absolutely love this camera. Its light weight, reticulating touch-screen LCD, crystal-sharp optics from the 18-55mm VR II kit lens and beautifully thought-out controls have enabled me to take dozens of memorable, perfectly-exposed photographs. The built-in flash is surprisingly useful, producing shots free from red eye and obviating the need for an expensive, add-on flash unit in many situations. Aside from time-lapse movies, a feature I haven&rsquo;t evaluated, I see little in the 5600 that isn&rsquo;t already available in the D5500, at a reduced price.</p>

<h5 id="nikon-s-best-budget-dslr-highly-recommended">Nikon&rsquo;s Best Budget DSLR. Highly recommended!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey whats up everyone, my names Chris Winter and today I’ve going to do an indepth Review of the brand new Nikon D5600 to see if it’s a good camera for you. Let’s review the brand new Nikon D5600.Build QualityLet’s first get started by taking a look at the build quality and features of the new Nikon D5600. When you first pick up the Nikon D5600, I’ve got to say that it really does feel nice. The Nikon D5600 is targeted towards either beginners, or photographers who want to step up from a begginer camera and I think it fits the purpose. It’s not a huge camera, but compared to something like this camera here, the new Nikon D3400, there is a noticable step up in size. Button placement is good too. Nothing too different from other Nikon bodies, so if you’re used to the Nikon system, you’ll feel right at home. So overall the Nikon D5600 feels great, it’s not too heavy and its not too light, its right in that sweet spot for a DSLR.LCD ScreenLet’s now turn the Nikon D5600 around and take a look at the LCD. And this is where things get exciting. The Nikon D5600 is one of a small number of DSLR’s from Nikon to have an articulating screen. And it’s a good one at that. Compared to some cameras from some other brands, the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is the real deal and can even be flipped to face you in the front. Now that might seem like an insignificant feature, but for people who film themselves like I do, that’s a huge deal and will mean this will be a great camera for youtubers. Not only that, it really does allow to get shots from up high or down low, which is normally a dificult thign to do if youre just relying on the viewfinder. The screen itself is also really quite good. I was very impressed with the screen from teh baby brother the Nikon D3400 and the Nikon D5600 is equally as good. One thing that I really loved about the Nikon D5600 is it’s touch screen. I really don’t know why more DSLR’s don’t include these as they make it them much easier to use. So overall the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is definitely impressive and one of the highlights of the camera.MenusSo I quickly wanted to touch on the menus on the Nikon D5600. Overall they were quite good with a lot of information and settings at your finger tips. Now if you’ve ever used a Nikon DSLR you’ll feel right at home in the menus on the Nikon D5600, but if you’re coming from a Canon background, it might take a while to get used to. So again, the menus are pretty good. They’re fast to get around and if you’re used to Nikon, you’ll feel right at home here.CompetitorsNow if you’re thinking about purchasing the Nikon D5600, theres a good chance you’ll have looked at some of it’s competitors. Firstly on the cheaper end, the recently released Nikon D3400 is another option to look at. It’s cheaper than the Nikon D5600 but importnatly is missing the articulating screen and the touch screen. The Nikon D5500 is the Nikon D5600’s predecesccor and is actually pretty similar. One thing it is missing htough is snapbridge which could be something you’re interested in. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse feature which is missing on the Nikon D5500 which is somehting we’ll talk about later. On the higher end we’ve got the Nikon D7200. It’s a little bigger and has great autofocus, but doesn’t have an articulating screen and is also more expensive. On the Canon side the Nikon D5600’s big competitiors are the Canon T6i and Canon T6s and also perhaps the Canon 70d and Canon 80d. The Nikon D5600 does have continuous auotofocus in video mode, but if compared to cameras like the Canon 70d or Canon 80d, it’s still not at that level. It works, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse mode as well which is a really nice inclusion. This was included on the Canon 80d and i actually found mysefl using it quite a lot so having it on the Nikon D5600 is nice. And if you do like to shoot in slow motion, the Nikon D5600 can shoot at 60frames per second so you can slow it down it post, nice. So overall if you’re looking for a great DSLR for video, the Nikon D5600 might not be the best, but it’s good.So overall I’ve been very pleased with the Nikon D5600. Is it a huge upgrade from the Nikon D5500? Well not really, but this is a great camera not only for photographers, but also for those interested in vdieo as well. Good job with this one NIkon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only had the camera for a couple of weeks but so far, I love it. The controls are very easy to use and it takes nice bright pictures. SnapBridge works very well with an iPhone. The LCD display is great for checking how your camera is setup and displays the most important shooting options clearly. Movies are surprisingly sharp and clear, a big improvement over movies I&rsquo;ve shot with a Nikon D70. I should add the pictures I&rsquo;ve shot with the D5600 are noticeable clearer and brighter than pictures I&rsquo;ve shot with the D70. They blowup better too if you use them as a wallpaper. I still give it five stars but there are two things I miss from the D70. First, it won&rsquo;t focus AF lenses, which I can understand but I&rsquo;m a little surprised that they left off the ability to save a setup. I know I really like to have a &ldquo;got to&rdquo; setting I can use when I want to use a camera quickly.</p>
