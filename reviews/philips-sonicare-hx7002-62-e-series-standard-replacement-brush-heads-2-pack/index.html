<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="sonicare-are-amazing-get-one">Sonicare are amazing, get one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this series of toothbrush for fourteen years now.Pros:I used a couple tubes of whitening toothpaste way back then and it had no effect. Once I switched to a Sonicare powered toothbrush using these brush heads, I saw my teeth get a couple of shades whiterI very rarely floss. I know I should, but I don&rsquo;t do it often. After switching to this brush, dentists have not told me that it looks like I don&rsquo;t floss anymore! I am NOT saying you can avoid flossing by using this brush, but I take it to mean that it does a way better job than my old manual toothbrush ever didMy teeth feel cleaner. For longer. Sometimes I end up needing to use an old fashioned toothbrush and I hate it. Once you switch to a Sonicare, be prepared to be a customer for lifeThe battery on my handle lasts about three weeks. My first handle lasted over 12 years. These are good products.ConsThey are more expensive than the smaller style Sonicare brushes and way more expensive than standard toothbrushesHaving a charger on your bathroom counter is annoyingBottom line:Get a Sonicare. Maybe get the e-series or maybe get the ones that take smaller brushes. The smaller brushes are cheaper but I&rsquo;ve not used one so I can&rsquo;t compare them.</p>

<h5 id="compatible-with-my-old-sonicare">Compatible with my old Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the longest time I was convinced that these replacement heads (&ldquo;E-series&rdquo;) would not fit my old Sonicare brush base, which I think dates from before 2007. It is the kind where the brush head is perfectly veritical (no angle). From the Sonicare pictures I now think maybe it is one of the &ldquo;Advance&rdquo; series - I can&rsquo;t tell from the markings on the brush base itself, and the packaging is long gone. (See photos I have posted which shows the old base and head.)At any rate, after reading someone else&rsquo;s review that made the claim that this replacement head would fit the older base, I decided to give them a try and found that the reviewer was right. It was such a relief, because I love my Sonicare, and those old-style replacement heads were becoming difficult to find; and when I did find them, they were outlandishly priced.The new replacement head works just as well as the old one. If I have to replacement every three months, that&rsquo;s fine. I agree with other reviewers - it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to avoid high dental bills.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-a-good-experience-for-me">not a good experience for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>not sure why but this pair and the ones I bought previously did not last very long. like 2 months or less and the grommet at the point where the brush stem meets the cover wore out and the brush no longer resonates correctly after that. Not sure they are actually &ldquo;Sonicare&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="new-replacement-heads-make-noise">New replacement heads make noise!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Sonicare for many, many years, probably 15 years, when they first came out. I have the Advance handle and Philips no longer makes replacement heads for the Advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called &ldquo;e-series&rdquo; that is supposed to fit the Advance handle. I ordered the three pack of the &ldquo;e-series&rdquo; and it does fit the original Advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use. Apparently, the magnets on the &ldquo;e-series&rsquo; don&rsquo;t match what was originally designed for the Advance handles. I called Philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise. It&rsquo;s not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads. The technician did not know about the difference in noise, checked with others and then got back to me that, yes, there is a difference in noise. Philips should tell the user about this difference. It&rsquo;s no big deal, but should be disclosed.What I found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads &ldquo;every 3 months.&rdquo; The old packaging said &ldquo;every 6 months.&rdquo; When I asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the American corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more, she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of &ldquo;dental professionals.&rdquo; Whether these &ldquo;dental professionals&rdquo; are part of the conspiracy, I do not know. Whether the new heads are not as well built as the old, I also don&rsquo;t know. But in any event, since I&rsquo;ve been using the Sonicare for the past 15 years or so I&rsquo;ve changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and I&rsquo;ve had no complaints from my dentist. I guess I&rsquo;ll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because I didn&rsquo;t change the replacement head after three months.But to Philips credit, at least they didn&rsquo;t simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads. The &ldquo;e-series&rdquo; does fit, albeit not perfectly.Stay tuned.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-multiple-sonicare-brushes-at-home-and-the-original-brushheads-that-come-in-the-same-package-with-the-brush-or-the-ones-i">I have multiple Sonicare brushes at home and the original brushheads that come in the same package with the brush or the ones I</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are not made according to Philips Sonicare quality standards. I have multiple Sonicare brushes at home and the original brushheads that come in the same package with the brush or the ones I buy from Costco or other trustworthy retailers are much better quality. These, however, begin vibrating differently very soon and have a shorter life span.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-counterfeits">Beware Counterfeits !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received counterfeit merchandise. Sadly, I ordered these when I opened my last package, so was too late to return them when I discovered they&rsquo;re fakes.You recognize counterfeit brush heads most easily by noticing that they have much softer bristles than the real thing. Also, the insets or &ldquo;dimples&rdquo; around the cap are sharply defined at the edges on the real item and rounded on the fakes.If you&rsquo;ve ordered these, open them as soon as they arrive, and if you got fakes, complain loudly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-tried-knock-off-versions-of-these-and-i">I have tried &ldquo;knock off&rdquo; versions of these and I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried &ldquo;knock off&rdquo; versions of these and I find those to vibrate much less vigorously than the brand name ones. THESE seem to be brand name ones but they (or at least the one I have tried) seem to have the same problem. I don&rsquo;t know what the explanation is. I have loosened the thing on top, and it makes more noise but it gets me about half way to the performance I am used to.</p>
