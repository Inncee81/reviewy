<p>I like everything about these earbuds! I tried 2 other brands to compare, and these are for sure the best of the 3. I purchased these to replace my apple ear pods, and I&rsquo;m glad I did. Other than the fact that they are Bluetooth, they do sound way better than the apple wired ones.They come with 3 different sized rubber tips, as well as 3 different sized ear hooks, which allow for various combinations. They ear hooks are separate from the rubber tips, which is a great design. For me, I use the medium tips, with the small hooks. It is a good idea that they are seperate so that you can make those custom combinations. Being able to make the perfect fit is what allows for the decent sound it has. When I first tried them on out of the box, they didn&rsquo;t sounds the best. So I tried different sizes and ended up with a good set up.For me, I was after some cheap Bluetooth earbuds, that had decent bass, and that&rsquo;s exactly what they have! Compared to the other brands I tried, these have Superior sounding bass. This is most likely do to the fact that the fit the best. The fit is a big part of how they will sound, so for me, they fit the best, therefore sounding the best. When I hold the other 2 brands in place, they sound decent as well, but I&rsquo;m not going to hold them the whole time I use them. So, having a pair that fits perfect, and you don&rsquo;t have to force them into your ears to sounds good, that&rsquo;s what you want. These were the more expensive ones that I tried, but to me it was worth the extra cost(less than 10 bucks) compared to the other 2. I haven&rsquo;t had them very long, so I can&rsquo;t talk about longevity. I also a don&rsquo;t write very many reviews on amazon, but I liked these so much that I had to write a review, so that says something at least! Also, their customer service seems to be very good.They even sent me a follow up email to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t having any issues setting them up, and assuring me that if I had any problems, I could reach out to them to make it right. I will be buying another pair for my wife to use as well.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-easy-to-pair-and-control-outstanding-value">Great sound, easy to pair and control, outstanding value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying that I could not be more delighted with this product, and that I am about to order it again for one of my daughters.I spent a (far too) long time researching and trying Bluetooth headphones to use with my iPhone 7 Plus before I found this TaoTronics product. The other products I found were either too expensive, sounded awful, had mediocre reviews, were uncomfortable, were fidgety to use, and/or had poor battery life. By contrast, these TaoTronics headphones hit all of these marks brilliantly.In particular, here are some of the things I like about these TaoTronics headphones:* Sound quality â€” These headphones sound pretty darn good to my reasonably well-trained ears. I listen to MP3s (audiophiles shudder) and also to higher-quality streams from a variety of sources, and they all sound quite good. The mid-range could be a little brighter, I suppose, but the low and high ranges are excellent, and the overall sound quality is very satisfying. Are these headphones going to compete with $500+ wired cans? No, of course not, but I&rsquo;m guessing that for most people, myself included, these TaoTronics headphones sound very, very good. And forget about doing a sweaty workout with those $500 cans&hellip;* Fit and comfort â€” Everyone&rsquo;s ears are shaped differently so YMMV, but I was able to find a combination of buds and hooks from the included set that are very comfortable for the 3+ hours at a time that I&rsquo;ve worn them. The ear &ldquo;hooks,&rdquo; BTW, are not the kind that go over or around your ear lobe, but rather sit within the lobe and act kind of like a spring to keep the buds in place. You don&rsquo;t need to use the hooks if you don&rsquo;t want to. I found that when properly fitted, these headphones stay very securely in place.* Noise isolation â€” One of the reasons I wanted in-ear buds is because of their inherent passive noise isolation qualities without having to spend more money for active noise cancellation circuitry. I want to be able to block out ambient noise when I&rsquo;m sleeping or writing or when I really just want to hear the music. At one end of the noise isolation spectrum, you have the stock Apple buds, which because of the way they fit really don&rsquo;t block out much ambient noise at all. Nearing the other end of the spectrum, you have these TaoTronics buds, which block out more ambient sound than quite a number of other wired and wireless buds that I&rsquo;ve tried. For me, this is a good thing. However, you&rsquo;ll want to be careful if you&rsquo;re wearing these (or any other truly noise-isolating) buds for activities, like riding a bicycle, where you need to be able to hear your surroundings.* Bluetooth support â€” These headphones were very easy to pair with my iPhone. That&rsquo;s probably due to a combination of Bluetooth 4.1 support and their particular circuit design, but the bottom line is that these headphones paired without a hitch, and they re-establish their connection with my phone within a second (yes) of being powered on. Range is decent. I&rsquo;m able to go a couple of rooms away and still maintain a solid connection.* Ease of use â€” The control buttons are easy to find and use without looking. And yes, unlike some other headphones, Siri works just fine with these. Controlling music and phone calls is straightforward. Phone call quality is good.* Battery life â€” I haven&rsquo;t had these headphones long enough to be able to make a judgement about battery life through many recharge cycles. The estimated 4+ hours seems accurate so far though.* Customer support â€” Within 24 hours of my receiving these headphones, I got an email from TaoTronics customer support thanking me for my purchase, offering several usage tips, and explaining how to contact them if I have any questions or support needs. Personally, I think that kind of attention is pretty cool.* Value â€” I&rsquo;m honestly blown away by how nice these headphones are, especially for the price. Speaking very subjectively, I&rsquo;m guessing that you could spend upwards of $300 and not do much or any better. For me, these are a no-brainer purchase: Buy them. You&rsquo;ll be happy you did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You get far more for your money than you could expect. The simple fact about these headphones is they just work, and work damn well. They come with a wonderful selection of very comfortable silicon ear bud sizes. They are super easy to use. I have them pair with my work IMac and my cell phone and it has no trouble managing both devices. The battery life is rock solid and the magnetic back sides really do keep it in place.I have run a few times with these and only once did I have a random disconnect and reconnect. The sound is warm and rich with a quite soft bass that feels like just the right amount. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong these are not the same audio fidelity as 200 dollar headphones, for this price you&rsquo;d be mad to expect that.A few cons I have are the cable is a little stiff. It&rsquo;s not that noticeable but you do notice that the cord starts to lose its shape and little. It still functions fine but maybe a higher grade cable next model. The sound is great for the price, there is a very subtle hiss to them when nothing is playing, this fades completely away when audio is being played. But the mid tones are a little muddy and I would like a more forgiving angle on the ear buds. They aren&rsquo;t uncomfortable, far from it honestly, but if you bump one of them it can distort the audio and just make it sound weird.To wrap it up, I would recommend these 100 percent. I think these are the greatest ear buds u have ever owned. I use them constantly and honestly I could not be happier with them. I truly would be happy paying 45 or 50 dollars for these, they are that good.</p>
