<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="beware-of-app-security-issues">Beware of app security issues!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are returning this item. Unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t notice that the required app had so many permissions, a lot of which were privacy nightmares. Their app requests permission to read your browsing history and bookmarks as well as all the apps you have running on your phone. It can also download whatever it wants whenever it wants. And see your phone calls and logs. After we got this I saw other reviews stating the same thing that were written just after we ordered it. I&rsquo;ve seen the company respond but did not like their answers. There is absolutely no reason for this app to need those permissions no matter what they say (and like someone else, I work in IT). I&rsquo;m always amazed that people blindly install apps without checking permissions, I guess some people just don&rsquo;t care. Which is fine as I understand that it seems like everyone is watching you. But when you have the choice you should choose not to install apps that ask for permissions that obviously aren&rsquo;t needed. (Note: There are a couple more of these reviews that go into greater detail than I did, I urge you to read them before purchasing this item)</p>

<h5 id="yi-home-android-apps-posts-security-and-privacy-threast-chinese-made-apps-has-access-to-administrative-permissions-scary">Yi Home Android Apps posts Security and Privacy threast. Chinese made Apps has access to administrative permissions. Scary!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The device itself is very well built and works fine.However the Yi Home Android App posts major security/privacy concerns. Norton Security classified it as data mining app. Its access permissions, I would say, dangerous. It will access your contact lists and uploaded to their servers. It will install, download files without your consent. It will modify system settings.Why would a simple camera app needs to have all these Administrative and System permissions? This Chinese made app is definitely a security threat for me. I don&rsquo;t want my device monitored and controlled by Chinese government.Here are the permissions listed from Google Play store updated December 22, 2016:Version 2.20.2.5_20161222 can access:Device &amp; app history&ndash;retrieve running apps ** Data Mining **&ndash;read sensitive log data ** Data Mining **Identity&ndash;find accounts on the deviceContacts&ndash;find accounts on the device ** Data Mining **Phone&ndash;read phone status and identityPhotos/Media/Files&ndash;access USB storage filesystem&ndash;read the contents of your USB storage&ndash;modify or delete the contents of your USB storageStorage&ndash;read the contents of your USB storage&ndash;modify or delete the contents of your USB storageCamera&ndash;take pictures and videosMicrophone&ndash;record audioWi-Fi connection information&ndash;view Wi-Fi connections&ndash;Device ID &amp; call information ** Security Threat **&ndash;read phone status and identityOther&ndash;Access download manager. ** Security Threat **&ndash;download files without notification ** Security Threat **&ndash;full license to interact across users&ndash;view network connections ** Security Threat **&ndash;change network connectivity ** Security Threat **&ndash;connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi&ndash;disable your screen lock&ndash;control flashlight&ndash;full network access ** Security Threat **&ndash;control vibration&ndash;prevent device from sleeping&ndash;modify system settings ** Extremely Security Threat **</p>

<h5 id="i-like-this-camera">I like this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this camera, we came home it took a picture of us walking in the House followed us across the kitchen alerted me. I have cats one of my cats walked to the door to go outside but we were not home it took a video of her walking across the kitchen twice and alerted me on my phone, you don’t need an sd card it saves the videos in the app and you can watch them then delete them if you want and you don’t need a cloud subscription unless you want one. I think this is a really good product worth the money. I just wonted something so if anyone did enter my home I would know it I would call the police. It’s never been a problem and I pray it never is. I just wanted some extra security this is perfect. Sincerely Venus</p>

<h5 id="great-camera-for-great-price">Great camera for great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kind of hesitant purchasing the 720p version but the quality is great. Image is crystal clear. App is so easy to setup and viewing over 4g when away is very fast. The pan tilt feature works great, it&rsquo;s nice looking around and checking if i have packages left at my door.Two way communication sounds good. I like the alert notifications and you can control the sensitivity. You can view playback from the app if you are at home or away. I have had this camera outside on my front porch for several weeks and it is still working like new.</p>

<p>Works good. Wifi signal does not reach as far as i would&rsquo;ve expected. Definitely works great when wifi is near. Easy to install. Works very good with the app for my android.</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work-on-mobile-network">Doesn&rsquo;t work on mobile network</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: Jan 29th: They fixed the problem with new update. Works via T-Mobile network. Please make sure it doesn&rsquo;t break again. If it does, fix it ASAP. Thanks!Edit: Dec 28th: replacing my stars from 3 to 1. Their customer care contacted me and were of no help. They gave me a generic link where people are complaining about the product. Highly un-satisfied with the customer service.Dec 25: It is a fine little camera. 3 stars because I can&rsquo;t access it on the road via app while I am on my T-Mobile network. I am in Seattle so it is pretty good network. It works fine if I have Wi-fi. I have other cameras other brands that I can access while I am not on wi-fi. I am not sure what&rsquo;s wrong with this one. It gives error 3019. Goes to 30% mark and doesn&rsquo;t connect. Please fix the app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with this camera! As our first test drive of a wireless camera, it is zooming right along keeping us in touch with our kitties romping around the living room&hellip; and I can turn on the mic and say Stop That! when I see them getting into mischief, and they freeze for just a second before moving on to their next target&hellip;.App is pretty easy to navigate, and I&rsquo;m conscious of the security issues mentioned in other reviews. I wish it didn&rsquo;t require such broad access, but the benefits of the app are worth it to me at this point in time&hellip; Second camera is on order now&hellip;</p>
