<h5 id="seems-to-work-fine-after-a-few-days">Seems to work fine after a few days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Initially I might have had some trouble with it possibly having a loose connection on the CAC, but I&rsquo;m not sure since it either resolved after a few days, or I changed something. Either way, it appears to be working fine. I&rsquo;ve only been using it on average every other day for 2 months now. Works with DOD e-mail, mypay, NKO, etc. Just follow instructions on militarycac.com or there&rsquo;s a youtube video that&rsquo;s 31:22 long that is very thorough and it&rsquo;ll get you up and running.</p>

<h5 id="first-card-reader-i-received-was-defective">First card reader I received was defective.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First card reader I received was defective. It did not work properly on Windows 7 64-bit systems. Only the card slot on the side worked; the slot at the end did not. If you put a card in the end slot, the OS repeatedly tried to mount the card but never recognized it. The reader seemed to work OK on computers running XP or Windows 7 32-bit, although oddly, under XP the end slot took the first available drive letter (typically E:) and the side slot became the next letter (typically F:). Under Windows 7, the side slot took the first letter. I tried this reader on several PCs running each OS, with entirely consistent results. The low cost makes it not worthwhile to return this item, but its flaky behavior means I won&rsquo;t be using it. I need to buy about half a dozen card readers for our Windows 7 64-bit machines, so I&rsquo;ll be looking for something higher quality.UPDATE 7/21/15: After my initial 2 star review, Saicoo sent me a replacement unit which worked as expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-give-it-4-5-stars">I give it 4.5 Stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second of these card readers I have bought, the first for work and the second for home. We have 4 people using this one reader at work every day (5 days per week) for the past 5 month.I would give it more stars if the usb tail was longer, great product highly recommended to people who have multiple formats to read from.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-i-would-recommend-it-for-the-price">OK. I would recommend it for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this card reader for lot of good reviews. but it is not working as expected.I have connected the card reader to my iMac (27 inch, 5k display), I use the card reader a primary device to transfer my photos and videos from SD card to the computer.Problem : 3 of the 4 card slots don&rsquo;t work, only one SD card slot is working, both microSD card slots are non-functional. also many of the times I have to plug-out and then plug-in back to use the device (Reminds me of restarting Windows on PC to resolve the issue and use the computer :-) ). Another minor issue for me is length of the cable attached to the device but I cannot blame it on the device as I was aware of its length and didn&rsquo;t realize it will be little too small to connect to the back of iMAC.Recommendation : I would recommend this product for the price and the fact that it is still functional :-). Also I believe that there could be a problem with iMac for not reading the microSD card (which is highly unlikely but I have to give benefit of doubt to the card reader :-))</p>

<h5 id="purchase-the-digiscan-usb-cac-smart-reader-desk-version-dod-compatible">purchase the DigiScan USB CAC Smart Reader Desk Version (DOD Compatible)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This company stands behind their product. I&rsquo;m reviewing the Saicoo DOD Military Common Access CAC. The first cac reader I ordered was defective. The company sent another cac reader (FOR FREE). I&rsquo;m using Windows 10 Pro. I plugged the new CAC into a free usb port and it immediately started working. The 1st cac I ordered must have been defective. It&rsquo;s nice to see a company that care about its customers and products. Be careful opening the CAC reader because there is a mini-cd included with cac driver, it&rsquo;s easy to break the cd while opening.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-customer-service-please-read-important-use-instructions-enclosed">Excellent Customer Service!!! Please Read!! Important Use Instructions Enclosed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>[UPDATED REVIEW]Wow!! After writing the below one star review Saicoo contacted me to make it right. They credited me the amount of the damage SD card so I could get a replacement and sent me another unit to try out. I don&rsquo;t have to tell you how rare it is to find a company that will do that. They deserve your business.IMPORTANT TECHNICAL UPDATE: The card reader works fine, the problem is there are no instructions and the stencils on it are difficult to understand. That is why my micro SD card got stuck, it was oriented incorrectly. DO NOT insert a micro SD right side up (pins down) in the end port or it will get very stuck.I suggest that Saicoo change the stencil on the side to show pins on the SD card icon and change the stencil on the back to show pins on the Micro SD card icon. This would correct the confusion.Here is the correct way to insert the cards:SD Cards:Must be inserted in the side port upside down (gold pins up).Must be inserted in the end port right side up (gold pins down).Micro SD cards:Must be inserted in the side port right side up (gold pins down). Note: about half of the Micro SD sticks out.Must be inserted in the end port upside down (gold pins up) Note: it goes in very deep and only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; of the Micro SD sticks out.&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Original Review: This product is flawed, poor design or bad QC. I didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to see if it worked. I opened the package gently inserted my new 64 GB micro SD in the end and that was it. It was stuck, as if it had been glued in and could not be removed. I was so concerned about removing it that I forgot to even plug it in and see if it worked. To make a long story short the $20 micro SD card was destroyed (along with my personal files stored on it) while trying to get it out; it broke into pieces.Afterwards, I did try the other ports. The side Micro SD port accepted the broken Micro SD without jamming, both standard SD ports (end &amp; side) took the SD adapter without jamming, but the end port is not properly aligned with the hole and is deeper than the side one causing the card to get jammed.I will contact Amazon returns for a refund for this reader, but what can I do about the $20 Micro SD that was destroyed because of it? Saicoo should cover the damage that their product caused.&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;READ MORE</p>
