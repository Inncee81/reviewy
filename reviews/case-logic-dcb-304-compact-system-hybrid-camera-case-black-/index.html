<p>From the Manufacturer
DCB-304 High-Zoom Camera Case</p>

<p>The Case Logic DCB line of camera cases is tailored to fit the most popular cameras and camcorders on the market. Sleek lines, textured materials and vibrant hairline accents create a stylish bag that offers the protection and quality for which Case Logic is known. Available in nine sizes, this family of cases fits everything from a point-and-shoot to a large DSLR with multiple lenses and accessories.</p>

<p>The DCB-304 holds most high-zoom, fixed lens cameras. This bag was designed for the person who wants to carry their camera and a few accessories but doesn’t need a full-sized case. The vertical-load camera compartment measures 5.8 x 4.6 x 3&rdquo;.
Materials
High-quality materials are used throughout this exceptionally crafted case, which is backed by a 25 year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Durable 840-weave nylon is paired with smooth polyester to create an appealing dual-textured exterior that is finished with hairline accents of vibrant red. The case interior is lined with scratch-resistant, micro rip-stop nylon in complementing red and gray for easy visibility of the contents. High-density foam padding secures and protects your delicate hardware. Rubber zipper pulls in matching black and red enhance the overall design of the case. Carry options include a padded handle, removable shoulder strap and an integrated belt loop.</p>

<p>Padded Flex Wall
A padded, flexible wall within the main compartment creates storage for a charger, USB cable or other accessories while separating these items from the camera. When not in use, this wall pushes out of the way and rests against the back of the case for added camera protection.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="yes-finally-a-case-that-fits">Yes! Finally a case that fits :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t taken this thing out yet, but so far I really like it! My Cannon camera fits in it perfectly even with the big lens and the side pockets have room for my battery charger. Seems pretty durable. I love that the strap is long enough to wear cross body. Great product, great price! Would recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bag-just-not-for-larger-bridge-type-cameras">Great bag, just not for larger bridge type cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is the one Amazon recommends for the Lumix DC-FZ80 camera so I bought one for my new camera. The camera fits, but just barely. I like to carry a couple of extra batteries but even that was an issue with this bag. The outside pockets do not expand outward, so the camera and the batteries fight for the same interior space, even though separated by a fabric barrier. I tried it for a couple of weeks but finally realized the bag was not going to work for me so I returned it. I hesitated to only give the product three stars because it is well made. But for this application (holding a larger bridge type camera), it&rsquo;s not the best choice.For those with the DC-FZ80 or the FZ70, you may want to look at the Lowepro Adventura SH 120 II - A Protective and Compact DSLR Shoulder Bag. It&rsquo;s slightly larger than the Case Logic product, but much more roomy. It gives me the choice of loading the camera lens side down or with the handgrip side up (my preference).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-70d-with-pancake-lens">Fits 70D with Pancake Lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&rsquo;t purchase this bag as a stand alone bag or to use full time. I bought this particular camera bag to store my DSLR with small prime lens in while transporting it in a backpack. I wanted the camera to be protected from other items in my backpack while traveling. This bag fits my Canon 70D snugly with a 24mm pancake lens, Granted I have to place the camera sideways. It will not be possible to store the camera in it with a lens that is bigger than the pancake one but it&rsquo;s perfect for my needs.It&rsquo;s a great quality bag</p>

<h5 id="i-am-planning-a-long-trip-in-which-i-am-trying-to-minimize-everything-i-am-bringing-along-and-i-can-t-get-over-how-perfect-this-little-case-is-for-my-camera-set-up">I am planning a long trip in which I am trying to minimize everything I am bringing along and I can&rsquo;t get over how perfect this little case is for my camera set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I currently own a Sony A7RII w/ the Zeiss Batis 18mm 2.8 Wide angle lens.I am planning a long trip in which I am trying to minimize everything I am bringing along and I can&rsquo;t get over how perfect this little case is for my camera set up. It fits snug with the lens hood on backwards, no movement whatsoever and is about 33% smaller than the current bag I was using. Throw in that this is at the fraction of the cost - this is the bag i was looking for! Absolutely perfect for someone with a similar camera set up looking to make everything as small as possible for travel!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-fit-for-sonly-alpha-6000-with-zoom-lense">Good fit for Sonly alpha 6000 with Zoom lense!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love Case logic products which are known for their good quality at reasonable prices. This one is no exception. I bought this case for my Sony Alpha 6000 since the original Sony carry bag was a little too bulky. Inside this case I&rsquo;m able to place a zoom lens (55 - 210mm, enclosed in its own thin case) at the bottom &amp; the camera (with its kit lens) on top of the zoom lens. This arrangement has been so far so good - quite compact and easy to carry - just what I was looking for. The only flip side is that this case is thinner than the Sony case. This is the compromise one has to make if he&rsquo;s particular about a light weight &amp; less bulky Camera case. I&rsquo;m happy so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-balanced-zippers-are-good-materials-are-quality">Well balanced, zippers are good, materials are quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits a nikon l820 with a little room to spare it&rsquo;s not like it would fit a large DLSR but it has enough room to fit a lot of common cameras. It&rsquo;s actually made from good material that feels really nice to the touch. There is a zipper on the inside that the designers were smart enough to put in a cover for it so it wont dangle around inside and scratch up your cameras screen or whatever else it could come in contact with. It seems like it would be really top heavy but it&rsquo;s surprisingly well balanced. Would recommend, don&rsquo;t regret purchasing and I always have buyers remorse if the product I get isn&rsquo;t up to my standards but this meets all of my requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-choice-for-compact-point-and-shoot-cameras">A good choice for compact point-and-shoot cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received, but it is well constructed and it looks like it will last 10 or 20 years. I can&rsquo;t find any reason to give it less than 5 stars. I will reduce my rating if something happens to change that.I have a compact point-and-shoot camera, not a DSLR, but the cases made for compact point-and-shoots don&rsquo;t give you much storage space. I want everything except my tripod in one package - camera, spare cards and batteries, cables, chargers, tripod quick-release plate, lens cloth, and the case&rsquo;s shoulder strap. This does the trick nicely, with a little room to spare. It could probably even hold a small hardcopy user&rsquo;s manual for the camera, if I had one. I will keep the camera in the small inside pocket to protect it from scratching by the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-basic">Better than basic&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is a perfect fit for my Pentax X-5 and would work well with compact zooms like the Nikon COOLPIX L820 or Canon PowerShot SX510 however the interior compartment is not deep enough to accommodate most DSLRS with an 18mm-55mm or larger lens. In terms of style and functionality, it is nearly identical to AmazonBasics Fixed Zoom/Compact System Camera Case (Gray Interior), but I think this one is of greater quality at a relatively insignificant price difference.The case has two zippered exterior pockets for storage of cables, lens caps and extra batteries. Both pockets have have mesh netting inside that will secure items like the batteries. The top flap has a zippered pocket for storage of SD cards and there is additionally another interior slot for separation of the camera body from other items like charging cables. The adjustable strap isn&rsquo;t real comfortable but it gets the job done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-protection">Good protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect fit for my new little Canon camera. I feel it&rsquo;s well protected, and I like the side pockets.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tiny-case">Tiny case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of pockets and thoughtful touches. The two side storage areas have an inner mesh panel to put memory cards or caps.</p>
