Product description
Nikon&rsquo;s Coolpix S4100 Digital Camera (Red) has everything you need in a compact camera, all beautifully contained in a stylish little pocketable package less than 1&rdquo; thick, and weighing in at 4.7 oz (131 g). Start with a serious 14MP CCD sensor for great image quality, add a sharp 5x wide-angle Nikkor 26-130mm (equivalent in 35mm format) lens and a brilliant 3&rdquo; LCD touch screen monitor with 460K-dot resolution&ndash;you can focus by just touching a point on the screen.The S4100 isn&rsquo;t just another pretty face, either&ndash;it&rsquo;s got one-touch 720p HD video, 4-way VR image stabilization to banish blurry pictures forever, sensitivity up to 3200 ISO that lets you keep shooting even when it gets dark, Subject Tracking Autofocus that locks onto a moving subject to keep it in focus at all times, and a Macro mode that produces fantastic pictures by focusing as close as 4&rdquo; from the lens.The Smart Portrait System makes every person you photograph look good, by automatically capturing a smile, warning you when someone blinks in a picture, automatically correcting red-eye and smoothing out wrinkles and blemishes on faces. There are 20 scene modes, including Pet Portrait, Night Landscape, Sports, Party/Indoor, Sunset, and lots more. This is a camera that&rsquo;s easy to live with, and will always treat you right.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Life moves fast. Catch it!
One Touch HD Movie Recording.</p>

<p>Staying connected means sharing life&rsquo;s happiest and most poignant moments with people you care about—and HD movies do it well. The COOLPIX S4100 is the full-featured camera you&rsquo;ll want for shooting high quality HD 720p movies. With One-Touch recording, movie making has never been easier. Digital zoom allows you to get close to the action whether you&rsquo;re at sporting events, beach parties, or music concerts. And since the compact COOLPIX S4100 has pull-from-your-pocket, easy-to-carry convenience, you can shoot college graduations, birthday toasts, and other once-in-a-lifetime events discreetly, so the action is always spontaneous and memorable.</p>

<p>When your movie is complete, watching and sharing it is also simple, with in-camera playback. Or, you can opt for playback on your TV or computer.</p>

<p>First it turns heads &hellip; then it shoots their pictures.</p>

<p>With its rounded body and sleek lines, the ultra-light COOLPIX S4100 sells itself on looks alone. It comes in four cool colors, plum, black, red and silver, which makes it a favorite choice of the stylish and design conscious. But while this camera is full of personality, it&rsquo;s also packed with versatile Nikon features that make it an ideal everyday camera. Slip the COOLPIX S4100 into your purse or coat pocket. At 0.8 inches thin and a feather weight 4.7 ounces, you&rsquo;ll hardly know it&rsquo;s there, and yet it&rsquo;s ready to shoot high quality stills or HD movies at a party, on the beach, or at a ballgame. You live life in high gear. You deserve a camera that keeps up with you every step of the way.</p>

<p>High Quality, High Resolution Touch Display.
If you love fingertip operation with a cool, intuitive graphic interface, wait &lsquo;til you start taking photos with the COOLPIX S4100. The camera&rsquo;s clear, bright, three-inch Touch LCD monitor comes alive with 460,000-dot detail. In shooting mode, Touch Shutter lets you choose a focus point simply by touching any part of the frame. There&rsquo;s also Touch AF/AE (Auto Focus/Auto Exposure) for convenient auto focus by touch. Plus, with Subject Tracking, you can touch any subject on the display and the COOLPIX S4100 will follow it through the frame.</p>

<p>The COOLPIX S4100 provides touch control in playback with features such as Paint Functions and Slide Show, which offers fun “character” effects and Image Scrolling. The COOLPIX S4100 is also equipped with several filter effects that let you add a personal touch to your photos, including Soft Focus, Selective Color, Color Options, Fisheye, Miniature and Cross Screen.</p>

<p>Take great stills and movies with a powerful photo partner.</p>

<p>The COOLPIX S4100 may be stylish, slim and compact, but it also has plenty of power. Nikon has equipped it with a 14.0-megapixel CCD sensor that assures exceptional image quality. It&rsquo;s paired with a 5x wide-angle optical Zoom-NIKKOR® glass lens that offers you excellent compositional freedom. Nikon&rsquo;s true glass lens boasts a focal length from 26-130mm, a range that zooms in for your best portrait shots and has a wide angle to cover beautiful landscapes. The COOLPIX S4100 even has 20 Scene Modes, including Scene Auto Selector, so you can leave it to this intelligent camera to automatically determine what type of photo you&rsquo;re taking and adjust the setting to assure a flawless photo every time. And just when you think this camera is maxed out with features, its movie recording capabilities capture all the action in 720p HD.</p>

<p>Hassle-free Nikon technology produces great shots every time.</p>

<p>Imagine an affordable, compact camera that&rsquo;s also smart enough to automatically correct for camera shake, take a series of shots and save only the sharpest ones, or intuitively adjust shutter speed when you&rsquo;re focused on moving objects. The remarkable COOLPIX S4100 does all that and much more. It&rsquo;s equipped with a four-way Electronic VR Image Stabilization system that minimizes blurred images. Its Motion Detection identifies moving objects and adjusts both shutter speed and ISO to create optimal settings to achieve the best picture. With the COOLPIX S4100, Nikon has thought of everything. When you&rsquo;re shooting in low-light, you&rsquo;re sure to get optimum results with high ISO speeds up to 3200. For both still images and movies that are sharp and clear, count on EXPEED C2 to heighten fine detail and image quality—and do it all with exceptional processing speed.</p>

<p>Convenient Features.</p>

<p>All-new Pet Mode feature
This innovative camera is ready to take on your imagination. Not only is it equipped with 20 Scene Modes that automatically adjust camera settings to assure optimum results for specific scenes, but also comes with new PET Mode feature. In this mode, it finds and focuses on the face of a dog or cat, then automatically fires the shutter.</p>

<p>The COOLPIX S4100&rsquo;s Smart Portrait System includes Smile Timer, which automatically recognizes when a subject is smiling and releases the shutter. Face-Priority AF finds and focuses on up to 12 faces. Blink Warning alerts you when your friends may have blinked. What&rsquo;s more, in-camera Red-Eye Fix™ corrects most instances of red-eye, while Skin Softening smoothes skin tones. The COOLPIX S4100 also has macro shooting capabilities as close as 4.0 inches, and a supplied EN-EL19 Li-ion rechargeable battery for approximately 190 still shots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned about 5-6 of these and will buy them again Dropping and other damage is not their fault! Great camera, great price (if you pay attention) and the image quality is fantastic! (take the time to set it up &mdash;- and if you&rsquo;re not happy &ndash; change the settings. ) I take 2-3,000 pics a year for my work (cya) and this camera has not failed! Ill buy another when I drop the next one.</p>

<h5 id="shoulda-listened-to-the-reviews">Shoulda listened to the reviews</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this camera from amazon in late April; the battery died while on vacation at the beginning of August and will NOT re-charge. I should&rsquo;ve listened to all the reviews here that warned about this problem. The camera was a great deal-fabulous price for the options-so I didn&rsquo;t listen. Because of that, I was left with a dead camera for the last month of summer vacation. I feel sick at having spent the money and now have nothing.Update and downgrade to my rating: I followed the online directions for returning the dead camera with battery, to the letter. Filled out online form, wrapped up the camera SEPARATELY from the tiny battery (how dumb is it that they tell you to take the tiny battery OUT of the camera for shipment?) and paid to send it to them. They sent a friendly status update that my camera was still under warranty so no cost to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; it but&hellip;&hellip;then sent back my camera with an invoice stating that my camera was fine. They said there was no battery included, which was WRONG. They must&rsquo;ve thrown it away when they unpacked it because it sure as heck WAS included. So now I&rsquo;m out an additional $10 and I still have a dead camera that only worked for four months. <em>B</em> *S*Ongoing drama&hellip;.so I called customer service to complain that, even though I sent paperwork stating that I was including the camera and battery, and included the camera and battery&hellip;they returned the camera stating they did not receive a battery. Customer service said they&rsquo;d talk to service dept and get back to me. <crickets> <crickets> Seven days later and no word, so I called back. The new CS girl said that the service dept never emailed the first CS back, which is why the first CS didn&rsquo;t get back in touch with me. New CS girl said she&rsquo;d re-email service dept and see if they&rsquo;ll respond this time. Er&hellip;..is this the best they can do? Really? What a set-up: talk to CS, service dept simply ignores CS, no resolution EVER. CS said that&rsquo;s all she can do because they can&rsquo;t call service dept, only email. Consumer is screwed.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-camera-despite-negative-reviews">Love this camera despite negative reviews</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this camera. I had reservations about it after I read the reviews on it. Especially with the battery issues. After I got the camera I found that when charging the battery it should be plugged into the wall outlet last. Then when disconnecting the camera from the battery charger it should be unplugged from the wall first. Otherwise it will cause issues with the battery. It clearly states this in the instruction manual. It is very easy to use and is compact which is nice because as a mother of two small children ease of use is very important. The flash does take a few seconds to recharge and when the battery is getting low the pictures start to get blurry. I have purchased two extra battery packs just to have on hand. They are very inexpensive on ebay and amazon. Another issue I read about was the touch screen. The camera comes with a stylus that can be attached to the strap and I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with it. There are many different settings on the camera that I am still getting used to and trying out. Very nice camera. Would recommend.</p>

<p>I bought this as a gift last Christmas, didn&rsquo;t even last a year. The lens won&rsquo;t open, the battery wouldn&rsquo;t charge.How sad.

<h5 id="fun-camera">Fun camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera I received charges just fine, that was my only concern for this camera. I went to local stores Radio Shack, Target and Office Max to look for cameras, they all had the S4100 on display, but were sold out after their sales at $99. I figured I would wait to get it shipped and pay no sales tax on Amazon it was also $10 less before tax on Amazon, so I ended up paying $18.91 less when ordering online, so thanks Amazon for saving me 17.5%. It takes great pictures with little lag time between photos and has a pretty good video camera as well. It&rsquo;s the best camera I have ever owned, (not saying much I usually opt for the cheapest one since I have a tendency to lose or break them) better than what I need, but much cheaper than many inferior cameras at $89.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointed">Very Disappointed!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the camera and used it one time and the battery died pretty quick when I went to charge it, it would not charge at all. I am very disappointed because it was bought to take on a family vacation but instead I ended up sending it back the day that we left.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-sure-about-this-nikon">Not Sure about this Nikon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have a Nikon DSLR that takes amazing photos with a complete dummy (me) operating it. Therefore, when I decided to upgrade my point and shoot, I had a strong preference for Nikon even though I&rsquo;ve had a good experience with Sony products.Long story short, after less then a week, the LCD display broke&hellip;which, unfortunately, seems to be a relatively common complaint on Nikon point and shoots based on reviews.During the time that I used it, I would say that - as expected - some of the photos were amazing. However, even when not needing the flash it took a long time for the shutter to activate, and I found it slow between shots&hellip;so I felt like I was &ldquo;losing&rdquo; some good shots of my son. To me, the whole point of these cameras is to be easy and idiot proof. Not sure I can say that about this one.</p>
