<h5 id="glad-i-bought-it">Glad i bought it&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very hesitant after reading the reviews because I an actually 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; 275lbs&hellip;. after about 5 minutes of putting it on, taking it off, adjusting, and repeating I was able to get a great fit! Stitching seems very durable, velcro is of good quality (loudest may not be good for silent tasks)&hellip; I use mine as a tool when hog hunting and am in the woods for multiple days&hellip; my walther 9mm full size fit perfect with the spare mag. Leatherman, extra flashlight, 2way radio, spare knife, wire saw, and hydration system fit very nice and the weight distributed nicely&hellip; do to my height the belt won&rsquo;t do me much good because the vest ends just at/below my belly button&hellip; but not a deal breaker for the price&hellip; even with 3 full AR mags I doubt the weight would be too bad as the vest design seems to carry the weight nicely (haven&rsquo;t tried it yet)&hellip;. I&rsquo;m going to be using it this weekend on my last weekend of bow season and see how it holds up packed and in use as I have to walk a half mile to my stand&hellip; but from initial appearance and fit, I would definately recommend it to any recreational outdoorsman, bug out, prepper, etc type person&hellip; may buy another for a co-worker for christmas</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was very worried when i saw the time gap when it was expected to arrive but it arrived on time with a pair of gloves i had bought, though it showed it was still being sent; Lol, but for a Chinese product and company they delivered a quality product, sure abit of stitching issues came to bear manly the pistol holder but like any synthetic material object just take a lighter or match and melt it no problem, fits secure and nicely, no odor to it, but main zipper goes up and then kinda v-necks and drops an inch, doesn&rsquo;t like being fully zipped but more than bearable its big and chunky and reliable, and the shoulder pad is great the part that sticks out is some kind of silicone cored peace that is dense and unsmushable , but the rest of the pad is still firm yet squishy. The Velcro and everything is quiet strong and tough, though when it arrived in its bag the little shotshell holder is in the pouch it rests on, at first being replaced by the yakeda logo pvc patch, Molle is strong on the back and the internal pouch is well made too, the drag handle is stitched on like a beast, the handle being rather tough nylon. Not product related but on the company cards that come with it there is a load of spelling errors as you can tell they are still very Chinese lol, but if your not a fan of plate carriers i&rsquo;d highly recommend this vest, only thing i wish is that it the pistol holster was strapped to two different sections and Velcroed into place.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-range-and-halloween-okay-for-hunting-not-seriously-tactical-surely-probably-why-the-price-was-so-attractive">Good for range and Halloween, okay for hunting. Not seriously tactical, surely. Probably why the price was so attractive.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;Army Fans&rdquo; in the title is actually a good clue as to the suitability of this vest, I think. I open by admitting freely that I stopped at 4 stars because I am not qualified to rate the item as a serious user. As a moderately skilled shooter, and simply unable to resist the low price, I bought the vest fully knowing that I will have little, if any, compelling reason to use it. I will wear it at the range, just to become comfortable and familiar with it, and learn how to load it and access things. My only other very likely use it perhaps as part of a costume around Halloween. Having said all that - the build quality seems reasonable to me. If you adjust it too tight for your trunk, you can, pretty easily, pull the zipper apart, so that&rsquo;s a rather critical adjustment. It is a plastic zipper. I suspect that metal ones resist pulling open better. Still, why adjust the vest tight enough to make the proboem, so, make of that what you will. I did get AR magazines and my Taurus <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> G2 .45 magazines in the intended holders. As others have stated, I don&rsquo;t see being able to get two AR magazines in the pockets, but given my uses it&rsquo;s not a problem. I suppose that if civilized society falls apart and I am actually defending out streets, I might have a different take on that. I&rsquo;ll go on record as saying I don&rsquo;t expect any such thing, so I&rsquo;m not going to worry about that. The pocket for radio is too small for my Baofeng UV82 UHF/VHF radio, but that&rsquo;s a sort of general purpose radio. Smaller, &ldquo;tacical&rdquo; radios might fit fine. I just moved it to the right top pocket, which is more than big enough.I very much like the belt positioning and sizing arrangement. The belt hangs from the vest by a number of velcro or snap straps. You have to undo all of those and remove the belt to size it easily. You could probably leave a few closed and leave it attached, but it hardly seems worth juggling. The belt sizing is with considerable overlap of velcro strips. You get the size right, then put it back in the mounting straps, and it seems very well held. A note: Notice that the belt is suspended from the vest, so if you&rsquo;re not hanging things on it, the size can be just adequate to hold everything still. If you want to hang, for instance, a holster, you will want to adjust the belt tight enough to transfer that weight to your hips. A noted that several folks do that, because the velcro mounting for the holster on the left side lower front of the vest does not seem adequate to hold a firearm of significant size or weight, especially if you&rsquo;re actually moving around quickly at all.The material itself is certainly thick and seems well made. The adjustment to trunk size is simple and allows for following your lines, so whether your spare tire is showing these days or you&rsquo;re lean and mean, you can shape it to fit you nicely.I guess I think overall that this is a fine hobbyist vest, for someone like me, more serious than just costume gear, but not really for serious tactical uses. With a price in the high 30s, I found that a reasonable and fun acquisition. A few hunting friends even decided that it would do for most of their hunting rounds, if they were of a mind to wear such a thing, which most of them don&rsquo;t seem to be. It&rsquo;s not a hunting jacket. If you&rsquo;re looking for serious tactical, I&rsquo;d say look elsewhere. For everything else, this is probably fine.</p>

<h5 id="pleasantly-surprised-at-the-quality">Pleasantly surprised at the quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pleasantly surprised at the quality. This vest is exactly what I was looking for, at a great price. Looks good, feels good. Nothing negative to say. Mine has no detectable odor, as I&rsquo;ve seen mentioned in other reviews. Zipper is plastic but appears to be plenty sturdy. Velcro (suitable for flag or other patch) where you see the shotgun-shell holder in picture. This would be a nice gift for any outdoor-type person. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;11&rdquo;, 175 lbs, and there&rsquo;s plenty of room for adjustment either way. Holster fits a Crosman P1322 .22-Caliber Air Pistol quite well, should fit anything that&rsquo;s not too bulky. Might not be roomy enough for a revolver. Good purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-vest">Awesome vest.!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow this is a great tactical vest plenty of pockets and Velcro.Mmade with very heavy duty material. Very adjustable and fits nicely when loaded down with items. The only thing,if you use Ar extended 40rd mags they do fit in the ammo pockets but you can&rsquo;t close the Velcro top straps but you can put them in the internal pockets with ease. Or you can get the extended pouches from 5.11 and add them to the vest. But overall an awesome vest.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-got-the-item-and-i-love-it-no-damage-at-all">Just got the item and I love it! No damage at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got the item and I love it! No damage at all. I love that the desert camo mag dump pouch came with the vest but I didn&rsquo;t like the color of the pouch and I wish that it was black. However the quality of the pouch is very good so I will keep it.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a gift my son loved it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-vest">Nice Vest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Removed a few things (belt and one pouch) to make it lighter. Put a few stitches on upper part of holster so it hangs straighter. Fits 170 lb 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-tactical-vest">Love this Tactical Vest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this Tactical Vest&hellip;Loaded it up to the Max with 8 fully loaded 556 mags (30 rounds ea.), 6 mags of 9mm, 1 Baofeng Dual Band FM Transiver UV-5RA, 1 Taurus PT92 9 mm Pistol&hellip;</p>
