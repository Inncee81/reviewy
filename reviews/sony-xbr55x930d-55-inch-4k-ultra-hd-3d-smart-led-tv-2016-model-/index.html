<blockquote>
<p>I bought my last Sony in 2011, the Sony Bravia KDL55NX720 55-inch. It was my favorite tv I&rsquo;d ever purchased. I try to buy a new, close-to-top-of-the-line or Top-of-the-line every 10 years (My last Sony before that was purchased in 2002). However, I had been reading about 4K and HDR technology and watching the prices fall, then I seriously started looking at a new tv about 4 months ago when I realized a perfect gift to my brother and his wife would be my current Sony. 55&rdquo; was exactly the size they were looking for and my brother already loved the minimalist and sleek look of that tv.Enter the XBR65X930D. I first saw it in person in a big box store while visiting family and having an afternoon of nothing to do but go look at electronics. At first I had been considering some of the highly rated Samsung tvs out there but seeing them side by side changed my mind in an instant. Reading in-depth reviews and avforum threads sold me even further on it.I&rsquo;m a big fan of movies, games and shows. This tv has the perfect settings for all content I&rsquo;ve tested it out on to this point. The &ldquo;Game&rdquo; setting is perfect for Xbox One and PS4 games. The lag with game setting is almost nonexistent. I read one review that said 55ms but that is not true. This has to be in the 33ms range that CNet reported. I actually feel it&rsquo;s better than my old tv which was below 35ms. It turns off MotionFlow and Cinemotion automatically. (I turn it off on every setting exceptions being live sports, which it has a setting for that it auto switches off if you change to another channel or input).Cable HD and Blu-ray look fantastic, again with tweaks to the picture setting and turning off MotionFlow and Cinemotion.One of my favorite things is that it remembers your settings for each picture mode, specifically how you set it for each individual input. So if my Standard mode is different for Cable(HDMI3) than for watching a blu-ray on my Xbox One (HDMI1) or PS4 (HDMI 2) it remembers that, for EACH picture setting for EACH input. And once you turn MotionFlow and Cinemotion off they stay off!For live sports the tv actually notices and switches you to &ldquo;Live Football Mode&rdquo; if you are watching NFL. This is the only mode I keep MotionFlow and Cinemotion on for, I can deal with the commercials having the &ldquo;Soap Opera Effect&rdquo;. And my favorite sport is Real Football (soccer) in which there are no commercials. Win-win!Next, Android TV. Have no complaints with this. Everything works like a dream. I love the voice feature when searching youtube for 4k HDR content. I love all the apps on it so far and hope that just a few more will come. It connected with my Google account and phone in a breeze. Happy that they have handed the reins of the menus and SmartTV over to the new industry standard Android. Everything works with everything and Sony can focus on the picture technology, which is why we buy the product in the first place.I see a lot of people complaining about the Active 3D on this tv so I was expecting the worst but after watching Wreck-It-Ralph, Kubo and The Two Strings and Gravity, I am blown away with how much better they look than they did on my other Sony. The characters don&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;flat&rdquo; and in the foreground; there is true depth of field. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the old Sony does a great job but technology does advance doesn&rsquo;t it (even if this is the last 3D tv Sony ever put out, I&rsquo;m happy to enjoy it for as long as I own this puppy).Then the big one. HDR content. Holy wow. I am over the moon with this tv&rsquo;s capability. The vividness and depth are astounding, and at 65&rdquo; I feel immersed in whatever I&rsquo;m doing, be it nature demos in 4k HDR or racing around Australia in Forza Horizon 3. I have read at great length about the importance of HDR to the tv world. 4K is big but without HDR, I didn&rsquo;t see much reason for it (and the cost was prohibitive). So glad I waited for it to be &ldquo;standard&rdquo; in tvs. I spent an entire weekend watching Amazon Prime and Netflix HDR programming. It was stunning. I had to rewind the programs a lot cos I missed the dialogue while staring at the depth, clarity and detail. One thing I do have to do everyday is change the brightness setting as the sun goes down. I have never seen such brightness (or deep blacks for that matter). I may just need to pick one of the settings to make my &ldquo;night mode&rdquo; as the light sensor mode seems a little over dramatic. I do see a bit of back light &ldquo;bloom when the tv is on but dark, but only while loading content or during some scenes on a blu-ray. It&rsquo;s there, but it&rsquo;s not a problem for me. The tv came in great, protective packaging and took about 2 hours to get out of the box but there were no bends or dead pixels. Most of the complaints I read were about things that seem like damage in transit or improper un-boxing. Fingers crossed that the two reviews on here about &ldquo;dead in 6 months&rdquo; are not a trend.The design of the tv is a thing of beauty. The triangle stand with the brushed steel plate and the tiny LED in the front bottom of the frame are very elegant looking.One final thing I want to stress. I constantly hear people saying they like HD and 4k but that &ldquo;everything looks like a Soap Opera&rdquo; or &ldquo;everything moves too fast&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m amazed people don&rsquo;t research it and find out it&rsquo;s the MotionFlow and Cinemotion (for Sony, and other &ldquo;motion-y&rdquo; terms for the other manufacturers). TURN IT OFF for anything except for LIVE TV and Sports. Turn it off!Great tv, perfectly happy with this for the next 10 years.p.s. If you need Active 3D glasses, I recommend the 3Active Sony-Compatible rechargeable glasses. They are ultra light-weight and block the sides so you literally have no distraction from the screen. They also come with a protective case!</p>

<h5 id="defective-tv-and-even-worse-service-from-sony">Defective TV and even worse service from Sony</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than 6 months since purchase, this flagship model of Sony&rsquo;s HDTV line will not power on. Spoke to Sony support for over an hour and a half troubleshooting only to have them tell me that the TV must be repaired. They have to order a part, mail the part to the Sony certified technician who will contact me with a time convenient to do the repair. A Sony Customer Support Representative said the wait may be 2-3 weeks. Another CS rep said the wait would only be 3-5 days. I asked Sony to replace the unit but they declined suggesting I call Amazon for a replacement even though the return window had expired. Spoke to Amazon&hellip;as usual they were very kind saying they would take the return but were only able to offer a fraction of what I paid as the return window had expired. Googled this problem online and found many people have experienced the same thing as me so there a definite problem with this TV. I bought this very high priced television based on Sony&rsquo;s reputation for excellence, both in product and support. Times have changed apparently.</p>

<h5 id="tv-with-great-specifications-but-awful-quality-control-and-buggy-software-awful-enhanced-delivery-service">TV with great specifications but awful quality control and buggy software. Awful &ldquo;Enhanced Delivery&rdquo; service.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great TV if you can manage to get a set that is not defective. I thought I would be lucky enough to get a good set but when I plugged it in and turned it on I immediately saw vertical lines dividing portions of the panel and differences in screen brightness between these vertical sections. The dimness of the right portion of the screen subsided after several hours of use, but the vertical segments and lines remained on the left side of the television. This is particularly visible when seeing a uniform black / grey color in the same area where the lines are present. This is also very distracting when playing FIFA, as the lines are visible on the grass. Needless to say, I will not be paying $2k for a tv with these glaring defects. This is a shame because in general I love the contrast of this television, the 3D support (despite the crosstalk, which actually seems to go away after an hour of watching the 3D film), the brightness and color representation.The TV works flawlessly with the PS4 PRO, and the HDR adds a lot of detail to the range of dark and light spectrum in games. The color gamut is extended but I was not blown away with colors in HDR on this set, as much as I had hoped I would be. Netflix is pretty glitchy but 4k and HDR content look great. Amazon Prime works well and the Grand Tour looks incredible. Sony has yet to release an update for Youtube HDR playback, but unfortunately I will not have this tv for much longer to find out if they do. Broadcast television does not look great because a heavily compressed 1080i signal stretched to 65 inches is bound to show lots of pixelation. If you want cable television to look sharp, do not go beyond 55 inches.Overall, the defectiveness rate, broken 3D, and glitchy interface issues are enough for me to return this television, rather than request a replacement.Finally, a note on Amazon Enhance Delivery: The XPO carrier delivering the television arrived on scheduled time. The two men did a good job carrying the tv to my room upstairs but when it came time to unbox it and set it up, they proved to be highly unqualified to handle this delicate equipment. They tore the packaging to pieces, scattering accessories so that later we could not find the power cord to plug in the AC adapter for 5 minutes. They handled the display like they were doing construction work. the screen was at one point being pressed into an angular piece of Styrofoam instead of laying flat. They put the stand on wrong 2 times without bothering to read the instructions and used a power screw driver to drill the screws in too deep. I originally thought its great Amazon includes installation for large items such as this one that could not be set up by one person, but after this experience, I highly suggest you refrain from letting XPO unpackage and install your TV. I also urge Amazon to contract a different company who know how to handle electronics and act professionally. I hope the company picking up the TV Monday will do a better job.</p>
