<h5 id="quiet-compact-and-stylish">Quiet, Compact and Stylish</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a laptop that I use for work and when I travel, I don&rsquo;t like to haul around a wired mouse. When this wireless mouse became available, I knew that I had to get it and see how I liked it.This wireless mouse is nice. I love the looks of this mouse in Black/Red and it fits comfortably in my right hand. It takes 1 AA Rechargeable Battery ( Included ) and one of the features that I love about this mouse is that it will go to sleep after a period of non-use which in turn prolongs the battery life. The Nano receiver stores very nicely in the bottom of the mouse when you are traveling with it.I have been testing this mouse for the last week and I absolutely love it! If you have a need for a wireless mouse by all means check this one out and at the price, it won&rsquo;t break the bank.</p>

<h5 id="nice-quiet-click-mouse-feels-durable">Nice, quiet click mouse feels durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this mouse this morning, so far I&rsquo;ve been using it and liking it. I ordered and received the red and black one shown in the item photographs. The actual colors matched the photograph and looked nice. The aesthetics of the mouse were nice.The packaging it arrived in was to the point and frustration free giving easy access to the mouse. The item arrived undamaged and the little box was intact and not crushed or otherwise compressed.The best part of this mouse is that it is rechargeable and has an optional double A battery slot. I had absolutely no issues with the wireless receiver and mouse, and it worked almost instantly. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even need to reboot after unplugging the old wireless receiver and plugging in this new one. This was a truly seamless, very easy process. I didn&rsquo;t need to do anything with respect to configuration in order for the mouse to work as expected. The mouse did not skip and fit good in the hand, it is not too small and not too large and the materials seemed like a nice thick plastic.This is a right-handed mouse and has two buttons on the thumb side which are easy to access, a scroll wheel on the top that depresses and scrolls easily and efficiently, and the left click and right click buttons were as whisper quiet as described. Overall, the mouse felt very solid and had a nice look to it, I would recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-so-far">Good so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this mouse to replace another one that had a known double clicking problem. I like it. I have the gold one. It&rsquo;s comfortable in the hand, light weight and does the job. I was a little confused at first with having to find the usb part (it&rsquo;s tucedk in the bottom of the mouse and obvious when you put the mouse on a flat surface) and the instructions were not all that well written to figure out (thus the 4 out of 5 stars) but there&rsquo;s not all that much to know. Charge it and plug it in and use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-recommend-you-pass-on-this-mouse">I recommend you pass on this mouse!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered 2 of these and had similar issues from the start.Let me start by telling you that I replaced my old wireless mouse because of how loud the click was. I was recording an instructional video and wanted to minimize the sound of the mouse clicking. I was happy with my old mouse but was looking for something quieter.First: I like when the mouse will wake the computer when you move it around. With this mouse you need to click a button and then move the mouse around to wake the computer. Annoying but minor issue.Second: The battery life on these is absolutely terrible. I was lucky to get a weeks worth of use from these. It has it&rsquo;s own internal rechargeable battery so you just plug it into a mini usb to recharge. It seems like a good system if the charge would last longer. My old mouse would go several months on a single battery.Third: I bought two of these, one for my desktop and one for my laptop. These were glitchy and sometimes needed to be reset. The mouse pointer would stall for a second and do this repeatedly until I unplugged the usb receiver and plugged it back in to reset it. Also, sometimes it would just fail to work at all until it was reset.I used these for a month before giving up on them. Yes they are quiet but my other mouse works flawlessly with zero issues.If you seek a quiet mouse that just works, take a pass on this product.</p>

<h5 id="disappointed-in-wireless-performance">Disappointed in wireless performance.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: ShiRui kept a running dialog regarding their product and sent me a replacement for this first mouse that did not work &ldquo;un-tethered&rdquo;. The second mouse does work well, as advertised. Their customer service is great!With full charge this mouse only works well when plugged in with USB charging cord. &ldquo;Un-tethered&rdquo; the scrolling wheel, left and right &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; are hit and miss at best; multiple &ldquo;clicking&rdquo; needed to get the mouse to recognize commands. Plugged in it works fine. (Yes, I do have the USB receiver plugged in.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worthless-waste-of-money">Worthless Waste of Money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After charging for hours, no light came on unless mouse remained plugged in to charger cord, which is very short, and still would not work even after rebooting, putting in a new, regular AA battery, moving it to on/off several times.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-little-small-but-works-like-it-should">A little small, but works like it should!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pretty little mouse. Nice rose gold color and looks great. The click buttons are SUPER quiet. It&rsquo;s a bit on the small side for my hand (I have longer fingers), but not to the point where it&rsquo;s uncomfortable. I like the auto-sleep feature to conserve battery!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="also-the-battery-life-is-pretty-good-so-far">Also the battery life is pretty good so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It took a while to figure out how it worked since the instructions are of little help.The mouse works well with my laptop. Haven&rsquo;t tried it on anything else yet.Minus one star for the instructions and the two side buttons not doing anything (from what I&rsquo;ve observed).It&rsquo;s not entirely silent but surely less noisy than the usual mouse.Big plus for the size and color. Also the battery life is pretty good so far. It automatically sleeps after a while to conserve energy when not in use.</p>
