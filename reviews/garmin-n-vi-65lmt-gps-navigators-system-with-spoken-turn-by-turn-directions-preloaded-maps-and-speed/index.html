<h5 id="garmin-55lmt-gps">Garmin 55LMT GPS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This does everything it say&rsquo;s it does. Very easy to learn and use. It tells you the name of the street to turn on. I have regestered it and it was an easy thing to do and now I do know my maps are up to date.It is supposed to tell me if there is a traffic jam in my route. So far I have not had any traffic problems but as well as this works on the speed limit and small landmarks such as gas stations display, I&rsquo;m sure the traffic feature will work just fine.There are no advertisements on this Garmin 55LMT at all.This unit only has maps of America and NO Canada at all. If you need Canada you need to get the Garmin 56LMT.This was a bargin at $179.99 and it replaces my good old Nuvi 350 unit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we used it on a quick trip to Lousiana last week and it was great. Put in the 5 or 6 addresses needed and it took us there without any problem. I like the warning when approaching a school zone. I will never purchase and onboard Navigation system. Before the 65 nuvi I had a small garmin in my truck and it worked flawlessly only problem was updating maps. The nuvi larger screen and the ability to make adjustments on the go is great&hellip;&hellip;.and it gives my wife something to do!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<h5 id="route-calculation-issues-and-hard-to-read-screen">Route calculation issues and hard to read screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had Garmin GPS devices for at least 9 years now, and I love them! The touch sensitive icons on my old Nuvi 1490 were no longer reliably working (especially the back icon at the lower left) so I decided it was time for a new unit. The Nuvi 55 is a very nice replacement, but I sort of miss my old 1490. This is why:1. For one thing, I can&rsquo;t figure out how it determines the fastest route. Under settings, I have selected the fastest route option, but on a recent 1000 mile trip it insisted on selecting interstate routes. I tried selecting alternate routes, and the Nuvi 55 said there weren&rsquo;t any. I&rsquo;ve driven to this destination before, and there aren&rsquo;t interstates along most of the way; my route along US Highways saved 2 hours over what the Nuvi 55 calculated as the fastest route. I&rsquo;m not sure I will be able to trust this model, and may have to input intermediate points along the route I know is fastest so it takes me this way.2. Secondly, I miss the green/yellow/red icons letting me know the traffic conditions along my route. It gives me a split screen on the right letting me know if there is a delay, and I like that it tells me how far away the delay is. But I&rsquo;d like my icons back in addition to the split screen.3. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m getting older, but the print on the screen seems small and hard to read. I bought the 5&rdquo; model, and now I wish I&rsquo;d gotten the 6&rdquo; version. I changed to a different colored background (Nederland) and it helped, but the banner at the top - which tells which road you&rsquo;ll take next - is still hard to read. I also don&rsquo;t like that the road is listed with the interstate sign (the shield with a tiny interstate number) instead of the &ldquo;I-25&rdquo; or &ldquo;US 87&rdquo; lettering which was much easier to read on the 1490.4. I realize that the screen is a bit cluttered, but I do wish it would give me a compass reading so I&rsquo;d know which direction I am heading. I admit to being directionally challenged. I can get the compass heading if I am not going to a specified destination, but I&rsquo;d like it on the screen all the time.That being said, this is still a nice unit which merits 4 stars. I hope to see a few software updates in the future which would rectify some of the shortcomings I&rsquo;ve found.</p>

<h5 id="luddite-holdout-converted">Luddite Holdout Converted.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have held off on GPS for years, but I am doing more big city driving and on the verge of a big trip, so I am giving it a try. I had always thought a GPS device was a poor substitute for good map skills and memory. But, it turns out, there are many advantages. It helps focus the driver, shows crossroad names and mentions names of streets on the route, actually adding to mental notation along the way. I also like the school zone and speed warnings, as well as the ETA. This particular Garmin has all I need and a nice big screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="routes-are-ridiculous">Routes are ridiculous</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a long time owner of a taxi service, I wish to say that if a driver for our company used the routes given for the destinations we entered, he would be asked not to work for our company. Neither the &ldquo;fastest route&rdquo; or the &ldquo;shortest route&rdquo; were reasonable routes on those we checked. The fastest routes were too indirect, and the shortest routes went unnecessarily through neighborhoods. Additionally, when splitting the screen to see written and map directions at the same time, only the current segment of the route is in print.Also, the unit needs to be connected to the mounting hardware with window suction cup to read your location and to get traffic updates. Cannot just be used flat, for instance, on a vehicle console as older GPS units.Very disappointed.We use Google maps on a regular basis and find them to be mostly accurate. We expected the same from Garmin.</p>

<h5 id="unit-worked-for-one-day-until-garmin-recommended-i-update-and-register-it">Unit worked for one day until Garmin recommended I update and register it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased December 2015, worked until map update Memorial Day 2016, have spent the last seven months working with Garmin trying to get issues resolved. Finally returned device, they replaced it. Unit worked for one day until Garmin recommended I update and register it. Word of warning be careful with paying for lifetime map updates as with this unit they make it unable to navigate anymore. I am still dealing with Garmin, I think they will honor the warranty and may upgrade to a newer device. I have many Garmin products have never had a problem, but never bought one with lifetime maps. To be continued.</p>
