<p>This day-and-age there are literally hundreds of cameras to choose from. The easy choice is to go out and buy what your professor or your friends have, or just get what&rsquo;s advertised the best or what looks cool. Honestly, if you are an amateur photog then you&rsquo;re going to take perfectly fine pictures with any DSLR in the mid-range level. My question is, do you need to spend 200, or 300 more on a camera that you can get exactly the same specs or perhaps better quality out of a DSLR that is cheaper?I found this site justafax.com/dslr and what&rsquo;s great about it is that it literally does a side-by-side comparison of the top 12 cameras in this category, based on all of the factors that should affect your purchasing decision.I found the information on justafax.com/dslr extremely helpful, especially in comparing the types of desires and features I was getting for my $. I think you owe it to yourself to check it out, the info is very concise and easy to read and should help inform your purchase. It&rsquo;s not a cheap purchase, so do your homework!Good luck guys, I hope you find the camera of your dreams.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-camera-d800-replacement">Amazing camera - D800 replacement?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like many folks, I pre-ordered the D800 the same day it was available. Alas, Nikon totally blew the market analysis vs production vs. supply chain formula. After waiting 2 months, I had to leave the country before Nikon got it&rsquo;s D800 act together. I needed a beat-up D90 replacement camera, and the D3200 seemed like a decent place-holder. I quickly ordered one before they were back-ordered too! Sure, the D3200 is DX, not FX. Sure, it is not nearly as flexible. Sure, it can only AF with newer lenses. BUT, you can buy about 4-D3200&rsquo;s for the price of a D800, AND it comes with a decent kit lens for $699!The tutoring graphical-based menu system is geared more to beginners, which I am not, so I find it maddening. Most will love it, since it is somewhat educational, and offers a great variety of pre-sets to take creative shots easily.It is amazingly light weight - lighter than most lenses! It is very quiet. The AF could be faster, but it&rsquo;s plenty fast enough. When you dig deeper, you shockingly find that the D3200 has many advanced internal features from the highest-end cameras (D800 &amp; F4). The high-res LCD rear screen, the EXPEED 3 image processing engine, and a new 24MP sensor. The EXPEED 3 image processing engine allows the D3200 to perform at an altitude unheard of for a so-called entry level camera. Nikon&rsquo;s Active-D dynamic range enhancement at 24MP at 4 frames per second requires substantial in-camera processing power.I bought this camera primarily for still photography. With the proper lenses &amp; technique, the results are stunning. Low-light/high ISO performance is far beyond what you should expect at this level camera. Candle-lit face images are noise-free, and look great. Still life&rsquo;s on a tripod at ISO 100, have more resolution that ANY DSLR I have ever used, with very little shadow noise. In short, I might not accept my D800 when it becomes available. I might use the D3200 longer than I thought, (waiting for the 24MP FX D600 for $1999 later this year &ndash; my guesses on price &amp; stats &amp; date)&hellip;or, just keep using the D3200. If it breaks (I&rsquo;m hard on cameras), I&rsquo;ll just buy a new one.Bottom line &ndash; the D3200: super light-weight, very quiet, super high resolution (&amp; low noise, high dynamic range, superb colors), incredible HD video with slow motion. It is no doubt THE most amazing DSLR value on the planet!5/14/12 UPDATE: I&rsquo;ve now shot 100s of images, using lenses from 11 mm to 600 mm. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot. Super-high resolution cameras are a new arena for most of us. On the surface, one automatically thinks you will get images with twice the resolution (12MP vs 24MP). Not so. MP resolution is measured linearly, so the increase while significant, is less than doubled. More importantly, when you enter the hi-res camera stratosphere, photographic technique &amp; lens choice are critical. While these high MP cameras are capable of amazing results, you have to work to get absolutely ALL the MP&rsquo;s this camera has to offer. Do not blame the camera if your initial results are less dramatically sharper than your old 6-8-12MP Nikon. It&rsquo;s probably you&hellip;BTW, the Nikon 18-55mm is a decent lens, but it doesn&rsquo;t do this imager justice. You can get better results, with better glass. The excellent f1.8 35mm DX Nikon on this camera makes a super-light weight compact package you can carry all day long, producing super images. A 60 year-old Nikkor Q 200mm f4, $70 or so on eBay, produces stunning results if carefully used on Manual, on a tripod.Set-up a table with clean background and a few artifacts on it. Use the sharpest lens you have, at f 8, on a sturdy tripod, perpendicular to the table, Shoot the scene with the in-camera flash on both old &amp; new camera bodies. You will see the difference easily when images from both cameras are compared side by side, enlarged to 100%.How does this translate to everyday casual shooting? Not easily. Sub-par technique still results in sub-par images no matter what camera is used. If you are a beginner looking for the best entry-level DSLR ever made, all of this won&rsquo;t matter &ndash; grab a D3200 and shoot away! Just note that the D3200 is capable of world-class imagery. If it takes more effort to take photographs of this caliber, it&rsquo;s a good thing &ndash; the D3200 forces you to up your game to get there!5/5/13 UPDATE. It&rsquo;s been a year. I have a D800 and a D3200. Yes, there are many differences between the two. One is at the high end of the spectrum, the other, entry level. When I&rsquo;m shooting commercially, or seriously in any way, it&rsquo;s the D800. It is a superb camera, if you own glass that can fully exploit the 36MP sensor, and your technique is solid. For everything else, I use the D3200. Why? It&rsquo;s light and compact. You can easily carry it around all day, with the f1.8 35mm, and hardly know it&rsquo;s there. If that lens isn&rsquo;t wide enough, shoot a 3-frame series and stitch them together in Photoshop. Again, with good glass and technique, the results are very, very good. D800 territory? No, but few would notice. The D3200 is a pleasure to use, and handles fast enough for most kinds of photography. You can use old manual Nikkor lenses easily, albeit with a bit more effort. With the focus confirmation dot in the viewfinder, manual focusing is easy. Exposure can be guessed and adjusted using the great hi-res LCD. I recently had to shoot an emergency-rush job covering a politician&rsquo;s speech. All I had in the car was the D3200, the 35mm f1.8, and an old, sharp 100mm f2.8 E Nikkor &ndash; my normal in-car-at all-times stash. The setting was indoors, in a bright garden area &ndash; no flash allowed. I was surrounded by folks with Nikon D4&rsquo;s and $1500 lenses. I got a few looks&hellip;.LOL. I boosted the ISO to 1600, used the $50 100mm @ f4 @1/125th, and the results were great, published in several places. The D3200 is a great camera for the money, I like it more now than when I first bought it!</p>

<h5 id="do-your-self-a-favor-just-do-it">DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR, JUST DO IT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>La la llaaovveee this camera!! Just to start this review I&rsquo;m super ocd with my purchases. Definitely more lenient with purchases worth less I&rsquo;ll admit, but not for a piece worth almost 400$. I reaseched on different websites and even visited a few stores for the best deal. Long story short this was it after about a week or two or hunting the best deal . It does not get better than this folks. The camera came brand spanking new. It came with original accessories like neck strap, battery, cap for camera, Lense cap, and battery charger, also a Manuel, and cd for the camera, oh and cords for the camera. Of course the camera also came with a brand new Lense too, AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens. Yeah this Lense alone is worth 250. Also the standard Lense for the d3200 is the AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR not VR II.. So think this was a added bonus for buying the refurbished item and having faith in nikon. I&rsquo;m transitioning from a SLR a FE2 to be exact. I love the functionality and all the capabilities of this camera thus far. The resolution on the screen really helps make bold adjustments too. This is the perfect camera for the aspiring beginner photographer. I&rsquo;ll post pics, hopes this helps anyone trying to make a decision. Please like if it has thanks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is probably one of the best cameras in it&rsquo;s class. It works great for the beginner and is capable of growing with you as you gain confidence with photography and with the camera itself. When this first arrived I was overwhelmed by all of the buttons. I never thought I would learn them. After reviewing the included literature once I feel reasonably confident on playing with some manual settings. It takes phenomenal pictures in auto &ldquo;point-and-shoot&rdquo; mode and has several auto/manual modes that seemed to be designed to take you from &ldquo;what is a DSLR?&rdquo; to &ldquo;I think a lower F-stop would really bring out her eyes.&rdquo; The pictures in fully automated mode are vivid, crisp and well-exposed for just about any subject in nearly any lighting condition. My cellphone camera takes pictures that make me look like a manic gorilla but this camera makes me look like a professional.</p>
