<h5 id="a-thorough-comparison-demonstrating-apeman-s-great-capabilities">A Thorough Comparison Demonstrating APEMAN&rsquo;s Great Capabilities</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>APEMAN 3D Glasses DLP Series Rechargeable Glasses Hi-Brightness/Hi-Contrast Compatible with All DLP 3D Projectors - 2PACKThese APEMAN 3D DLP Glasses were used for and are compatible with my ViewSonic PJD5255 3D projector (<a href="http://amzn.to/2rWp2SB).So">http://amzn.to/2rWp2SB).So</a>, a while back I purchased two pairs of the ELEPHAS DLP link glasses (<a href="http://amzn.to/2sUnxcH">http://amzn.to/2sUnxcH</a>) and I was truly impressed with their capabilities. Recently, I purchased two pairs of these APEMAN DLP glasses to compare performances of the competing brands. And, I don&rsquo;t know, but I think I&rsquo;m leaning toward APEMAN&rsquo;s product as my preference, and I&rsquo;ll share why.First, the ELEPHAS glasses are very lightweight (barely noticeable) and are flexible enough to fit over glasses. The lenses will dim the image while in operation, but really only minor dimming. Like, there&rsquo;s hardly a difference between images with and without the glasses. They came fully charged with appropriate charging equipment and other accessories. I used them moderately for about four months (and, unknowingly, letting them rest in Stand-By mode instead of properly shutting them down) before the charge quit. After only 2 hours, each pair was fully prepared and operational. (It should be stated the accessories and charging capabilities are similarly featured with the APEMAN glasses.)In contrast, I will say the APEMAN glasses are bulkier and a little heavier than the ELEPHAS. Although the weight difference is barely noticeable, the thickness is of the APEMAN pair is quite obvious, which really wouldn&rsquo;t seem like much unless someone requires an additional pair of prescription glasses. Yes, the APEMAN glasses DO fit over prescription glasses comfortably, but really only as comfortable as having two thick pairs of glasses a nose can allow. The lenses also dim the image even more than the ELEPHAS.So, why do I prefer APEMAN to ELEPHAS? Honestly, the bulk of the APEMAN works in favor for a better viewing experience. The ELEPHAS are wonderfully light and slim, but until I had tried the APEMAN, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed just how much peripheral light the ELEPHAS pair had let in. Unlike the ELEPHAS, the APEMAN has a thick cover on each side of the glasses which almost completely blocks out any side light from entering my eyes.A benefit to the light reduction with the APEMAN glasses is an allowance for the eyes to focus only on the projected three-dimensional image, instead of receiving sources of light both through and outside the lenses. So, even though ELEPHAS has lesser dimming lenses than the APEMAN, the leaking light almost offsets the whole experience. In this way, APEMAN wins out by providing a more controlled viewing area which offers incredible clarity.Other bonuses to the APEMAN, however minor, come in a more conveniently placed Invert/Power button located on the side of the glasses as opposed to ELEPHAS&rsquo; placement of the same feature on the bridge of the glasses; and there&rsquo;s also just an overall sturdier feel.Hey, you made it! Good for you for sitting through all of this. I will share some photo/video support for this review. Please, let me know how this review has helped you by indicating on the button below, and please do not hesitate to ask me any questions about this product!</p>

<h5 id="these-are-the-ones-you-want">These are the ones you want</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Quality, huge improvement over standard LG glasses - they feel like a good quality pair of Sunglasses but a lot lighter. They wrap around and block out ambient light and motion from the sides, extremely comfortable and the wrap around design actually helps keep you focused on the TV. These glasses are absolutely amazing and very good looking on your face, they actually help block the light out by quite a lot, and have a great feel to it when wearing it, which also helps with 3D viewing experience. Overall they are excellent buy. I recommend them to anyone who is looking to get better glasses. Well worth the purchase, they are inexpensive, they work beautifully. The enclosed side prevent glare from surrounding lights, they are crystal clear. I could swear the picture looks sharper in the 3D with the glasses on than with them off. These are the ones to go for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are a bit bulky, but not to different from Nvidia 3d vision glasses if you are familiar with those. Glasses sync right up with the BenQ 2050 through dlp link.The pair came precharged and I was able to watch a full 3d movie out the box without charging. Eyeglasses fit snug under these but are not uncomfortable.Decent 3d glasses can&rsquo;t imagine paying much more for a pair when these affordable glasses work just fine.</p>

<h5 id="love-the-design-of-these-glasses">Love the design of these glasses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were the great from my DLP 3D projector that I have in my living room. My last pair stop working while back and I haven&rsquo;t been watching three movies since then until now I decided to purchase and try these out. The thing I like about this pair of glasses is that the way the design is I feel like I&rsquo;m more immersed in the movie. Well pair had openings on the sides that would bug me. The image quality of my 3D movie was good.</p>

<h5 id="works-awesome-with-benq-ht-3050-projectors">Works awesome with BenQ HT 3050 projectors!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great 3D glasses that work great with the BenQ HT3050 projector. It&rsquo;s great to finally see movies in true 3D and glasses last a long time before ever needing to be recharged. Great product highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="worth-it-so-worth-it-hidden-gems">Worth it! So worth it. Hidden Gems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The best hands down. Craftsmanship is awesome and these are the first i can honestly say that are comfortable to wear</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>having a great time using my 3d glasses on my 3d projector. Works great! and looks even better.</p>

<h5 id="really-good-specs-a-must-buy">Really good Specs a must buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really love them. The picture is so clear and there is no flickering. Just beautiful 3D graphics at its finest. A truly must have for anyone with a 3D projector. You still reading but already you can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it for 4 3D movies so far so good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent, works perfect. I love it. i will buy more if i need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-to-bad">Not to bad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They stay in sync with my Optoma 142 fine, but they are darker in the center of vision than they are around the edges. My other brand glasses don&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Work great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-ones-so-far">Best ones so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like how it comes in a neat package with the USB cable, a soft cloth bag and extra nose gels.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Work great out of the box</p>
