Make memories and share joy with Nikon&rsquo;s new high-resolution Coolpix L22 and its 12.0 effective megapixels, 3.6x zoom and huge, bright 3.0-inch LCD. Nikon&rsquo;s 3-way VR Image Stabilization System automatically detects subject movement and adjusts the shutter speed and ISO to compensate for camera shake and minimize image blur. The camera&rsquo;s Easy Auto Mode with Scene Auto Selector simplifies your picture-taking experience by letting camera automatically select the best setting to get great pictures.

<p>Carefree operation and high performance combined for consistently great pictures</p>

<p>Combining the precision optics of a Nikkor lens with the image quality and performance benefits of Nikon&rsquo;s innovative EXPEED digital image-processing concept, the Coolpix L22 is a quality compact digital camera that combines high performance with outstanding operating ease.</p>

<p>Intuitive and automated operation ensures carefree command over the high performance features of the Coolpix L22. Activated in Easy Auto Mode, Nikon&rsquo;s Scene Auto Selector makes capturing special moments as easy as turning on the camera and shooting without worrying about any settings. Electronic VR image stabilization, Motion Detection, Nikon&rsquo;s BSS (Best Shot Selector) function and ISO 1600 capability help ensure sharper results in lower light, or when capturing fast-moving subjects.</p>

<p>The Coolpix L22 is powered by AA size/R6 batteries, for the added advantage of being able to pick up a new set in virtually any corner of the world. The Coolpix L22 provides reassuring freedom from any worries about recharging or running out of power when a special shutter chance presents itself.</p>

<p>The large high-resolution 3-inch LCD monitor offers a bright image that is a pleasure to view, even outdoors. Controls are sized and placed to ensure intuitive operation. For example, dedicated buttons on the back of the body make it easy to switch between shooting and playback modes. And the contours of the large thumb rest and the body itself assure a solid grip. Design is just one aspect of the Coolpix L22 that combines beauty and functionality.</p>

<p>Nikon Coolpix L22 Feature Highlights</p>

<p>EXPEED digital imaging technology
Nikon&rsquo;s smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon&rsquo;s comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography.</p>

<p>Intelligent automation contributes to carefree shooting
Easy Auto Mode simplifies photography by taking control of settings; just turn on the camera and shoot freely. Activated in Easy Auto Mode, Nikon&rsquo;s Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot, making it faster and easier to capture the moment in beautiful fashion. The Coolpix L22 and L21 use this intelligent function to analyze the subject and its surrounding settings and automatically select the most appropriate scene mode to achieve optimal results.</p>

<p>Advanced image stabilizing features* help ensure sharper results Nikon&rsquo;s Electronic VR image stabilization and Motion Detection compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. Nikon&rsquo;s original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus.
* The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image.</p>

<p>Nikon&rsquo;s exclusive Smart Portrait System
Automatically detecting as many as 12 faces in the shot, Face-priority AF helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smart Portrait Mode* helps to faithfully record precious moments by automatically releasing the shutter when the subject smiles. Blink Warning displays an alert when it suspects that a subject has blinked. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory.
*The Smart Portrait Mode function for the Coolpix L22, L22 and L21 operates in the same fashion as the Smile Mode function for other models.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-camera">Love this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I simply LOVE this camera. I am an over 50 year old artist. I wanted good quality pictures but I don&rsquo;t really understand the new technology. This camera is so easy to use and gets the quality I want in the pictures. You can even adjust certain elements to improve the picture even more to your liking. I would recommend this camera to anyone.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-camera">Awesome Camera :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start off by saying that my last camera was a 3.5 MP and it was good for what I used it for but I let it bounce off the floor one to many times and it has died. That is when I started to look around for other easy to use good quality cameras. I looked at a lot of my friends cameras and started to read all the reviews.One of my friends had the Nikon L20 and he loved it. I tried it out too and loved it but I then found out that the L22 was replacing the L20. I asked around and found a friend that had the Nikon L22 and he let me use it for a weekend. What a very nice camera. It did everything I wanted it to do and then some. All the pictures and videos looked awesome to me and I did not have one problem with it at all. All the pics were sharp and focused. What more could you want? East to get batteries! Yup this camera uses AA batteries and I had a boat load of them. Everything in my house seems to use AA batteries so a long time ago I switched everything in my house to rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. They last forever in this camera. Say if you were at a wedding or something and your batteries run out. Just go to your local corner store and get a few easy to find AA batteries or just bring a few extra from home. Life is easy for me. I hate the proprietary batteries that come with most cameras. The other good thing about this camera is it uses standard SD and SDHC memory cards. I got a 8GB SDHC card for $19.00 bucks. It gave me something like 2,200 available pics to take at 12MP. Needless to say I purchased this camera in sliver from Amazon.com and I take it everywhere with me. Remember it is a $100.00 dollar camera and not a $500.00 dollar camera. It doesn&rsquo;t have all the high end features like touch screen but it has everything I want and it takes really nice pics. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll go wrong with the Nikon L22. Get it. Trust me :-)</p>

<h5 id="got-what-i-wanted-at-this-price">Got what I wanted at this price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are on a very very tight budget (air ticket took the most part of my budget already) and don&rsquo;t want to pay anything over $100, this is the camera for this price. Below is my feedback after taking a couple of hundred pictures in a trip to Hong Kong.Pros:-low price-pictures are of good quality (12mega) and over 95% of them were in good focus and clear. I printed about 150 pics (including Disney World in HK) on photo paper thru PhotoMax in Hong Kong for Mom in law and they came out very well. They look good on computer too.-took about 10 video clips. They all worked well on computer when replaying (the camera does not have HD format support yet in its video).-use AA batteries (I know some people do not like this as it makes the camera a little bigger - anyway just a little bigger only and OK with me) but I like it because if the battery runs out by accident and I have no replacement handy, I can purchase anywhere easily. BTW, I had 4 rechargeable AA batteries and this camera took 2 at a time and so most of the time I did not run into the need to buy new battery. You can take a lot of pics with just 2 batteries. The only one time we had to purchase new batteries was because we forgot to bring the other 2 batteries out and the ones in use ran out. This is much better than when a camera is using other type of batteries and you forgot to bring them out and you won&rsquo;t be able to use your camera in that case at all.-flash is OKCons:-the mode that has face detection just does not work. If you use that mode, the pictures you got would be extremely extremely disappointing and that&rsquo;s why some other reviews here said that the pictures from this camera were very poor and this was because they probably have selected that mode. If you stay away from using that and select other mode, the picture would come out just fine. With that said, you are not really getting all the features that you pay for here. Even this camera is cheap, the price per each working function may be more expensive than the others. But too bad, I cannot spend more than $100 for a camera in my budget and so I have to stick with it (still better than not being able to get a camera at all).-the sports mode is only 1/250th second and its much slower than most of other camera (1/1000th second).So if you cannot afford more than $100 like me and you only care about taking reasonable good pictures easily (no sports - sports mode is slow), this may be the right camera for you. If you can spend more than $100, you should check out something else and you can get better sports mode and higher zoom power, etc.Hope this helps.</p>
