<h5 id="4-months-later-computer-is-still-not-fixed-and-the-5-day-claim-is-a-total-lie">4 months later computer is still not fixed and the 5 day claim is a total lie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchasing this item was the biggest mistake I believe that some of the reviews might be fraudulent, this was my experience with Square Trade in April I experienced a 55 minute hold time and was finally told that a &ldquo;certified&rdquo; technician would be sent to my home. The technician should up and could not fix the computer, he suggested that I run to Best Buy to pick up a external disc drive so that he could load software from there. I did so and honestly the only reason I did was because I really needed a working computer.The technician could not fix the PC so I decided to take it to a local repair ship who said that it would be cheaper to purchase a new computer and that fixing it would basically be like building a new PC. I contacted Square Trade and they said that another technician would come out and look at the computer and that this was there process. I was very upset by this point and said I want the money value of my PC. They than said that the technician needed to come out again and they would take a look at the computer. As of July 2nd the computer is still not repaired and I am still dealing with Square Trade.When I purchased the protection plan it said if the computer is not repaired within 5 business days I would be reimbursed, so far it was been four months and nothing has been resolved.</p>

<h5 id="very-extensive-warranty">Very extensive warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The direction to access the warranty were fairly complicated; but after I looked deeper, there was a very good deal of step-by-step instruction on how to file a claim, and what it would achieve. I think it is always a good idea to get extra protection plans and extended warranties.</p>

<h5 id="beware-i-purchased-a-hedge-trimmer-which-has-a">BEWARE - I purchased a hedge trimmer which has a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE - I purchased a hedge trimmer which has a 4-year manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty - the Square Trade email I received after purchase makes it clear that they won&rsquo;t cover the motor or electrical during that time - so the 4-year plan I purchased is worthless! Why is Amazon letting Square Trade get away with this fraud? My next step is to return the worthless Square Trade &ldquo;protection&rdquo;.</p>
