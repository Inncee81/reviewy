<ul>
<li>Wide compatibility: Bluetooth 4.0 Receiver compatible with most smartphones, ideal for home or vehicle audio systems. But please do not attempt to connect the gadget to such as bluetooth headphones or bluetooth speakers, this is totally meaningless since the gadget functions as a bluetooth receiver for those devices without bluetooth feature itself but desire to receive bluetooth signal.</li>
<li>Double link: Connect two Bluetooth devices at once; freedom to enjoy music or answer phone calls</li>
<li>Control it: Change the volume, play/pause music, or skip tracks with ease; Apple devices can even activate Siri with the click of a button</li>
<li>8 hours of talk and play time, or up to 200 hours on standby on background.</li>
<li>Talk with clarity: Hands-free calling with the built-in microphone makes catching up with friends a breeze</li>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed-with-an-iphone-7">Just what I needed with an iPhone 7</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was recently given a surprise upgrade to an iPhone 7+. I have some lovely noise-canceling Bose earbuds. The old school headphone jack was discontinued on the iPhone 7 varieties. It did come with an adapter, but it plugs into the charging port. So you could either be listening or charging, not both.There are quite a variety of splitter adapters that let you plug in both headphones &amp; power, but most reviews were terrible and it seems like you loose the ability to control the volume or stop/start music using the buttons on the headphones. I was about to ask for my perfectly good 6S+ back. Especially since I was also having a hard time finding a case for it.When I explained my frustration to my boss, he said I should be able to get Bluetooth thingy like this for around $15. I was rather overwhelmed by the options of all the different Bluetooth do-dads and it was hard to figure out which ones did what I needed. Eventually I found some $30 ones, but my boss is smart so I knew there had to be a cheaper option. A little more searching led me to this device.I ordered it Monday, got it Tuesday after paying for one-day shipping (because two day shipping wouldn&rsquo;t deliver until FRIDAY for some reason). Sorry, was a little sidebar rant about recent Amazon shipping weirdness, not related to this device.I was trying to find the page in the instruction book about pairing it, but I inadvertently activated it and I was able to pair it to my phone immediately. Then I plugged my headphones into the receiver and turned some music on.Magically, I could hear that music without my headphones touching the iPhone. I didn&rsquo;t actually expect it to work the first try. It was awesome, Bluetooth is awesome and this device is extra awesome.It&rsquo;s actually nice not to have to unplug my headphones when I leave my office&hellip;I can just take them off and walk away. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to see how far it works or anything, but that really isn&rsquo;t a factor since I primarily use my headphones at my desk. I don&rsquo;t notice a difference in audio quality when using this vs. plugging my headphones in.The receiver uses the same power adapter (Micro USB) as my headphones so I just take turns charging them during the day when the lights on one or the other start blinking.</p>

<h5 id="car-headphones-stereo-input-etc">Car, headphones, stereo input, etc.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A car kit is just the tip of the iceberg. This setup works well in headphones, earbuds, home stereo. I tested it on every wired speaker I could find&hellip;instant Bluetooth connectivity. The built in mic made Bluetooth calls a reality in my dinosaur of a truck. I do use a ground loop isolator in-line to eliminate feedback when the receiver needs to charge but it&rsquo;s a cheap fix to avoid engine whine through the speakers. I can highly recommend this receiver if you want quick connectivity and a cheap update to your existing wired speakers.</p>

<h5 id="updated-convenient-easy-to-use-but-probably-not-designed-for-use-with-full-room-sound"><strong><em>UPDATED</em></strong> Convenient, easy to use, but probably not designed for use with full room sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update to original review:I was contacted by TaoTronics within 24 hours of leaving 3 stars with a fix to the problem. I simply needed to hold the volume up button rather than quick clicking it. I put the volume up to maximum on the TaoTronics Bluetooth Receiver and then controlled the volume with the playing device and the sound was much more full and perfectly adequate for office use. I would recommend this product. The convenience and size are more meaningful now that it sounds good, too. And they have great customer service to boot.Original review:Convenient and easy to use, reliable, and small enough not to get in the way. The only problem is that it is most definitely not for audiophiles. Obviously, a true audiophile laughs at the notion of adding something like this to the arsenal, so it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal. If you are looking for a $15 unit that does exactly what this unit is supposed to do and &ldquo;just ok&rdquo; sound is good enough, then this is fine. I suspect that if you re using it with headphones or in a car it might be fine. But I was attempting to use it in my office with a pair of Audio Engine AE2&rsquo;s and a Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer. It works, and it&rsquo;s fine for stuff like streaming talk radio or low volume background music, but if you appreciate high quality sound, and intend to use it for that, this is not for you. I&rsquo;m not sure something like that even exists in a package this small, so I am going to keep looking.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-goods-10-stars">This is the goods. 10 STARS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not usually one to gush over any item I buy, except for instances where the product far and away exceeds my expectations. This is one of those instances. I listen to a lot of music and podcasts so it isn&rsquo;t uncommon for me to have some form of audio going for a good majority of a day. I have gotten 10+ hours off of a single charge, the sound quality is great, and its conveniently small form factor makes it almost unnoticeable when used in either a home audio setup OR, in my opinion, something far greater. Aside from being an all-in-one unit, this can be used as an excellent replacement to any high dollar Bluetooth headsets on the market. Combined with any headsets of your choosing, simply plug them in and connect to your source of audio. Since there are no high data volume MP3 players being sold that exceed 120GB and/or use flash memory, I recently employed an old android phone to become a killer MP3 player. Upgraded with an extended battery, a 200GB microSD card, and Beats audio built in the phone, I can get high quality sound for 3+ DAYS on a single charge! (note: I achieved this by setting the phone to airplane mode and turning off wi-fi. Battery life will likely shorten if the source isn&rsquo;t the microSD card.) Using a paid app called PowerAmp as my audio source, I can now bring my entire collection with me where ever I go. The only con I&rsquo;ve discovered is occasionally during non-use if you leave it connected, the signal stutters upon resuming audio. To correct this, simply turn the device off, then back on and reconnect the Bluetooth signal.In short, I highly recommend this product and will gladly purchase it again if ever my current one somehow breaks.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<p>This product is amazing and I&rsquo;m so happy it exists. The setup was very easy and it worked right away. I love not fumbling around with an aux cord and the sound quality is perfect.</p>
