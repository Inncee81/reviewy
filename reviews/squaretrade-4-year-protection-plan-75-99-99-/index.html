<h5 id="4-months-later-computer-is-still-not-fixed-and-the-5-day-claim-is-a-total-lie">4 months later computer is still not fixed and the 5 day claim is a total lie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchasing this item was the biggest mistake I believe that some of the reviews might be fraudulent, this was my experience with Square Trade in April I experienced a 55 minute hold time and was finally told that a &ldquo;certified&rdquo; technician would be sent to my home. The technician should up and could not fix the computer, he suggested that I run to Best Buy to pick up a external disc drive so that he could load software from there. I did so and honestly the only reason I did was because I really needed a working computer.The technician could not fix the PC so I decided to take it to a local repair ship who said that it would be cheaper to purchase a new computer and that fixing it would basically be like building a new PC. I contacted Square Trade and they said that another technician would come out and look at the computer and that this was there process. I was very upset by this point and said I want the money value of my PC. They than said that the technician needed to come out again and they would take a look at the computer. As of July 2nd the computer is still not repaired and I am still dealing with Square Trade.When I purchased the protection plan it said if the computer is not repaired within 5 business days I would be reimbursed, so far it was been four months and nothing has been resolved.</p>

<p>i bought this for a product and the product quit working in a month and i emailed about replacement and nobody responds back</p>

<h5 id="beware-i-purchased-a-hedge-trimmer-which-has-a">BEWARE - I purchased a hedge trimmer which has a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE - I purchased a hedge trimmer which has a 4-year manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty - the Square Trade email I received after purchase makes it clear that they won&rsquo;t cover the motor or electrical during that time - so the 4-year plan I purchased is worthless! Why is Amazon letting Square Trade get away with this fraud? My next step is to return the worthless Square Trade &ldquo;protection&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-waste-your-time-purchasing-this">Do not waste your time purchasing this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not waste your time purchasing this. I bought a pair of headphones less than 2 months ago and thought why not cover them? Yah, complete waste of money. I filed a claim which was incredibly tedious and on top of that, when I finished my claim, even though there is clearly a hardware problem that came from a faulty mechanical issue with my purchase, I got an immediate message back &ldquo;hardware damage not covered&rdquo; and my claim was closed without discussion. First of all, what in God&rsquo;s name is covered, if hardware isn&rsquo;t? Don&rsquo;t buy it, just call amazon and they will replace the item because they are amazing, but this protection plan protects is an absolute waste of time.This is coming from someone that NEVER writes reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-of-this-add-on">Beware of this add-on</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cost for the coverage was good. The problem is when you review the plan via email, it is vague to what is covered and there is no explaination that you have to contact Square Trade and register the product with them.When I went to cancel it became a nightmare of jumping through hoops.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-your-money-put-your">not worth your money!!!! put your &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>not worth your money !!!! put your money a shoe box the plan only covers the amount that you paid for plan .Not the price of Item !!!!!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="square-trade-fair-trade">Square Trade = fair trade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought an electric lawn mover that was defective. No help form Amazon or UPS on that. Terrible experience only silver lining was the prompt response by Square Trade for a refund for the extra protection on a product that was recalled because it would catch fire.</p>
