<blockquote>
<p>Edit <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub>: Exactly as I feared, the left crank arm&rsquo;s pedal threads are stripped. Who in their right mind puts a thick coat of paint on soft aluminum threads? Now i have to order another set of cranks to replace this BRAND NEW crankset, and I haven&rsquo;t even put a single mile on the bike. Don&rsquo;t buy these cranks. Spend your money on something that will actually make it out of the garage before falling apart.Utter crap.2nd Edit <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub>: It just gets worse and worse. I should&rsquo;ve expected it after the nightmare of trying to remove the drive-side crank arm, but the excessive paint on the left (stripped) crank arm resulted in my Park crank puller pulling the threads out instead of removing the crank arm. I had to use a GM power steering pump pulley remover to extract the junk crank arm without damaging my brand new bottom bracket.Words cannot express how much I hate this crankset, but it looks like I&rsquo;m stuck either ordering another just like it or dealing with the removal of the drive-side crank arm which already has buggered threads from trying to remove it after test-fitting it to verify chainline.I have over 20 years in metalwork and fabrication, roughly 30 years worth of mechanical experience (including several years as an aircraft structure mechanic), and currently work in quality control for a large steel company. I believe I&rsquo;m qualified to say that this crankset is poorly manufactured and constructed of low-quality materials.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Original review:Decent looking crankset, but the paint is so thick in the threads that it took close to 45 minutes with a hook scribe, cleaning the paint out of the threads, in order to thread my Park crank puller into place. I&rsquo;m having the same problem with the left crank arm right now, and have very little faith in the threads holding my pedal(s) in place once installed. I thought I was getting a decent deal on a crankset for my single-speed project, but I now wish I had spent more to start with since these have been such a pain to deal with&hellip;and I haven&rsquo;t even started installing the drive-side pedal yet. Not pleased with my purchase, and definitely do not recommend these cranks. Spend the extra money on the Origin8/Lasco Track crankset. Much, much nicer.</p>

<h5 id="installed-correctly-this-crankset-is-worth-the-price">Installed correctly this crankset is worth the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I give the Retrospec crankset five stars. After reading other reviews, about oversprayed paint and pedals backing out, I decided to tru a pair for myself. Ok, step one: use a thread chaser on both the pedal threads and crank pulling threads. This will clean all the paint off. Step two: if your pedals are backing out and falling off the crank arm, you are probably riding &ldquo;pure fixie&rdquo; without brakes. I suggest using blue loctight on the pedal threads instead of grease. In doing these two things I have had no problems with my crankset. It&rsquo;s awesome and color selection, along with price, make it stand out in a crowd!</p>

<h5 id="i-had-two-of-these-the-left-crank-got">I had two of these. The left crank got &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had two of these. The left crank got stripped on both of them in about 50 miles. Once that happens the crank slowly works its way out of the bottom bracket and then you are walking home. Must be very cheap metal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-great-looking-and-functioning-crankset-but-be-advised-it-requires">It&rsquo;s a great looking and functioning crankset but be advised it requires &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great looking and functioning crankset but be advised it requires a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> chain. I tried a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> chain and got major chain suck where the chain gets stuck in between the teeth and gets grabbed up the chainring before letting go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-re-fine-but-note">They&rsquo;re fine. But note</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re fine. But note: I think that these cranks may first be tapped <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;x20tpi, then re-tapped at <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo;x20tpi. I think this because atop every thread peak was a distinct crease that followed the thread perfectly. Why did I care? because I found that the pedals threaded into the cranks somewhat sloppily. They have tightened with use, as they should, but I was nervous for a awhile that they would not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="short-term-joy">Short term joy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this crankset about 4 months ago for a fixed gear build. It worked well for what I needed it to&hellip;.for a while. On a recent ride, the threads on the crank side completely disintegrated. The threads are gone and I was able to lightly pull out my pedal with ease. I am disappointed in this product performance and I hope that modifications to this component was rectified. As it stands, I would not recommend this crankset at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-an-everyday-bike">Great for an everyday bike!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty great for the money. Took a 110mm square taper BB to fit the chainline on my fixed gear. The included chainring is decently solid and round for under $40, and the cranks have little noticeable flex. These went on my beater/commuter bike and I think that&rsquo;s where they should belong. They do look good, but I don&rsquo;t have to worry about dinging them up because they are so cheap. I ended up replacing the chainring with a 45t one just because it was a better ratio, but I&rsquo;m sure the stock one would hold up well. FYI, uses 130 BCD chainrings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-nice-but">Looks nice, but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I rode these cranks a month, noticed my left crank arm started to wobble. Used lock tight, tightened it up. From then on, any time I rode more than 4 miles it started to wobble again. Finally pulled the left crank arm off and the entire inside is just falling apart. Cheap!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-bargain-i-will-be-buying-a-few-more-sets">Good bargain, i will be buying a few more sets.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product logistics is very fast, I am very satisfied with it, the price is cheap, quality is very good for anyone. These are great .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-very-pleased-with-my-purchase">I am very pleased with my purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>sure I received a working product. Would buy again! I can not wait to use. A satisfying product I bought this time. I love how beautiful this looks Can&rsquo;t fault it so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The drive side pedal fell off while biking after about 2 weeks of use, turns out the socket the pedal goes in is already completely stripped and the whole crankset is now useless.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-sturdy-construction">Works well. Sturdy construction.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this part in an emergency. The chainring squeaks a little, but i just have to tighten the nuts that attatch it, but you should always check pre assembled cranksets&hellip;</p>
