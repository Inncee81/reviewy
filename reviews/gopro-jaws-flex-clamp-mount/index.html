<h5 id="clamp-your-gopro-almost-anywhere">CLAMP YOUR GOPRO (almost) ANYWHERE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own two GoPro Hero 3+s so I originally purchased two of these clamps. When I realized I could attach an adjustable neck to a second adjustable neck to double the flexible length, I purchased two more. Each neck is about 7&rdquo; long so now, if I need to, I can reach a total adjustable length of 2&rsquo;4&rdquo; and the four combined necks have no trouble holding the GoPro with a battery bacpac in a waterproof case up. Really sturdy.The clamp is also fantastic and is able to clip on to almost anything. Sometimes you really need to use your muscles to open it up all the way to clamp onto a larger pipe or something, but its not really an issue.5 Stars all the way!!!</p>

<h5 id="new-addition-to-my-hero5-and-session-toolbox">New addition to my Hero5 and Session toolbox</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I try not to purchase non-OEM products in order to to just save a few dollars, Spend the money you will be glad you did. The Jaws hold firm, and what I like most is that the mount can be used in a variety of ways.I will be using the mount to attach a Gopro to a truss light rail in a temporary manner. The gooseneck attachment allows me to quickly swivel the gopro to different sides of my dj gigs and wedding events. as I need in a 360 manner. It also allows me to extend the gopro to , creat different angled point of views. When I am moving or done for the night, I can simply unclip the jaws or detach the gooseneck with the quick clip insert.I am thinking of purchasing the additional gooseneck that comes with the Jaws Clamp Mount. Attached this second Gooseneck to the Jaws mount gooseneck via daisychain allows me to further extend the camera in a variety of directions. Will see ln the future.FYI the goose neck clamp has no instructions, took a few minutes to figure how to open the clamp. There is a strap, that comes with lt. l havent figured out if its for packaging only or there is uses for lt, no youtube review mentions lt.</p>

<h5 id="i-don-t-buy-brand-name-much-but-this-accessory-is-a-must-buy">I don&rsquo;t buy brand name much, but this accessory is a must buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This clamp is so versatile, you can clamp it onto basically anything. I&rsquo;m not sure if it is recommended, but I took out 2 of the joints on the gooseneck so there are now only 2 pivot points. The gooseneck now measures to about 3.5&rdquo; from the top of the clamp to the bottom of the camera. The neck still pivots 2 ways, and the camera gets much sturdier footage. You can use 1 of the pivot points up to the 5 that were provided. The one set back is the joints are pretty tough to remove and put back in place.It&rsquo;s very easy to flip camera around to face the other direction without moving the clamp.I was very impressed with the strength of the clamp, as it has not slipped or been jarred loose yet. I am very excited to try the clamp on my boat to capture some fishing videos and will update then.I have had the clamp for about 3 weeks and it has worked great so far!</p>

<h5 id="flawed-product">Flawed Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While the clamp and the goose neck are of high quality and are rather useful, you&rsquo;ll soon run in to the same problem that many people on the forums are having - the mount at the base of the gooseneck: the locking clips are relatively thin and will break within a short period of ownership.GoPro wants you to send them pictures of the broken locking clip along with receipt, a description of what you were doing when it broke and then&hellip;you still aren&rsquo;t going to get a replacement. The goose neck base is slightly different than the one used on other accessories so you aren&rsquo;t going to be able to swap out parts. Buy it, use it, when it breaks, reach for the duct tape.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mount-for-stagnant-mounts">Great Mount, for Stagnant Mounts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really do like this mount: but it isn&rsquo;t as versatile as you may imagine. It&rsquo;s fantastic for mounting in places where the object you are mounting on will not move, shake, or vibrate; otherwise - beware.I&rsquo;ve used this mount for quad riding, roll bar mounting on vehicles, and bicycling: but with mediocre results. The mount offers so many possibilities, but has very little stability. The gooseneck transmits and amplifies mounting point vibrations, which is no good for video quality. Taking off the gooseneck and using the clamp alone is does improve transmitted vibration, but obviously limits your views. The clamp does offer pretty firm mounting, and the faux zip tie insert allows for very secure mounting around round objects smaller than the jaw opening.Also, be cautious when looking elsewhere: the first few goosenecks released were released with 7 &ldquo;gooseneck balls&rdquo; and later versions had 8.As with most of GoPro&rsquo;s mounts, they are better than any of the knockoffs I&rsquo;ve seen, but at least double the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="holds-firmly-and-easy-to-remove">Holds Firmly and easy to remove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We mount our GoPro to the roll bar of our Caterham, and I got tired of having to unscrew the roll bar mount to remove the camera every time we left the vehicle unattended. I thought this, which has a quick release mount at at both ends of the neck, would be a better alternative. I learned fairly quickly that removing the camera from a quick release mount isn&rsquo;t quick at all if you use the anti-vibration tab, so removing just the camera, leaving the mount in place is not a quick alternative. However, it&rsquo;s easy enough to take it all with you. You can use this item with just the jaws or if you need it higher, you can leave the neck on. For us, mounting the camera directly to the jaws is perfect. The jaws hold firmly where you put it, but a firm squeeze and it all goes with us. This is a much quicker solution to the roll bar mount that screws on.</p>

<h5 id="vibrations-were-minimal-clamped-to-my-helmet-over-100-mph-but-pretty-bad-at-any-speed-when-clamped-directly-to-the">Vibrations were minimal clamped to my helmet over 100 mph but pretty bad at any speed when clamped directly to the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This clamp is strong as hell. My mom can&rsquo;t even squeeze it open. Vibrations were minimal clamped to my helmet over 100 mph but pretty bad at any speed when clamped directly to the bike but I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the fault of the clamp because my handlebar mount and front fork mount are both WAYYY worse in terms of vibration. The rubberized sections definitely help get a solid grips on the handle which is understandably more compact than a regular clamp just to make it less cumbersome when clipped to helmets and such. There is also a thick little adjustable rubber strap with the texture of a huge ziptie that loops on the inside of the clamp that protects the finish of your surface from the clamp&rsquo;s tough steel spring and cane be used to create a false bottom in the clamp so it has a more shallow bite. Overall great product.</p>

<h5 id="not-as-tough-as-advertised">Not as tough as advertised.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After only using it on my bike on 5 rides it fell apart while I was on the highway and damaged my 360 camera in the process. Expected more from GoPro. Sorely disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ve-used-a-lot-of-off-brand-gopro-mounts-but">I&rsquo;ve used a lot of off-brand GoPro mounts, but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used a lot of off-brand GoPro mounts, but for the Flex gooseneck, you have to use the official mount. Solid mount worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works great. I used this to mount my GoPro Hero5 to my kayak. It has a super tight grip and all the flexibility I need to get the shots I want.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money-time">Don&rsquo;t waste your money/time.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is essentially a plastic tube that is connected to a grip. The tube is bulky and noisy. The clamp is so hard to open that I had to use all my weight to open it.</p>

<p>That clamp REALLY clamps (LOL) It&rsquo;s very sturdy and easy to use. Might even help you strengthen your muscles while pushing the clamp down. LOL</p>

<p>Love it, needed a good bracket to use on the boat when I pull the kids this is very solid and I have no concerns with it flying off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After I bought it and use found no problems, I believe it is very durable.Now I am ordering again, to give my girlfriends, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll like it. Just thrilled with this item!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is strong. And I needed it to be. (Mounted it on my balcony 300&rsquo; up where the wind can get very high) Wind? Doesn&rsquo;t bother this beast in the least. Also that clamp?</p>
