<h5 id="high-quality-screen-equal-to-oem">High Quality Screen - Equal to OEM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One Sentence Review: This is a really good, relatively inexpensive product that will replace a broken screen and restore a phone to like new condition that I would recommend to anyone.Full Review: The world of iphone screen replacement is always tricky. I have replaced the screen on an iphone 5 previous to undertaking the adventure of replacing the screen on my iphone 6 plus so I have some experience. If you want to fix your broken iphone 6 plus, which in my opinion have very weak screens, you basically have three options being (1) take your phone to apple and let them fix it for about $130 dollars plus the time and aggravation related to the usually brutal experience, (2) purchase a high-priced replacement on Amazon for around $100 dollars, or (3) take your chances on one of the many questionable lower-priced screens on Amazon. In my opinion, if you are considering spending around $100 on a replacement you should just take it to Apple or send it to them. The $30 you will save isn&rsquo;t going to matter. The difficult thing of purchasing one of the lower-priced options is they all have reviews of around two or three starts and it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to decide what to purchase or who to trust. But, if you&rsquo;re going to go that rout you have to take a chance and that&rsquo;s what I did.I am here to tell you that I guessed right on this screen and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with it. I searched through every available screen and read quite a few of the reviews for each. The reviews are mixed for them all and who really knows why. I assume that at least for this screen they are related to people who couldn&rsquo;t handle the technical aspects of the installation. The installation was a little tricky but that&rsquo;s not the screen&rsquo;s fault it&rsquo;s just the way it is. If you are good with your hands you can do it but if you are even considering a replacement you probably already know that and just want to know if this is a quality screen. The answer to that question is that is most definitely is. I have shown it to several people since installing it last night and they are very impressed with its quality. There is no way to tell the difference between this screen and an OEM.If you have made it to this screen and this review, please know its a great option and will be money well spent.</p>

<h5 id="nice-screen-poor-tools">Nice screen poor tools</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems nice so far, a couple weeks in at this point. However, there was a brief point in time (about an hour) that the screen was flickering.after that it stopped and all was fine again. I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m made the connections properly and cleandly so it is unlikely due a bad connection. Hopefully it lasts.Do not depend on the tools that come with this they get the job done but the metal of the philips and the torx drivers are so soft that they break down during use and make the process difficult. I ended up using my own tools to finish the process.Packaging was sufficient and cleandly.Buy this for a cheap quick fix. Will update if screen goes bad.Well here is the update: The screen went bad after about 45 days. The image on the screen would go crazy and start shaking from left to right so I replaced it again&hellip; Will update again if the second one goes out.</p>

<h5 id="product-is-solid-decent-so-far-tools-are-okay">Product is solid. Decent so far! Tools are okay!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>2nd time buying the iPhone 6s screen replacement for 2 different phones. 1st phone had an issue with a non responsive touch screen, but I readjusted the cords in the back and it works fine. Fixed this on July 7th. 2nd screen was purchased for another phone and I installed it today, July 11, and it works well. My sister is very happy. I read some reviews on the screen going out or having bad color and will adjust my review accordingly if it happens. But so far so good. For the most part, of the item doesn&rsquo;t work, it&rsquo;s the tech/person installing it incorrectly. Will purchase again if the need arises. I do wish that this company would sell the product with just the screen and not the tools (tools are mediocre, doesn&rsquo;t magnetize well, and I have my own tools)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">DO NOT BUY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is TERRIBLE! I got this screen put on Monday and on the first day, it was fine and I was happy to have it. He next day is when I started having problems with it. It wasn&rsquo;t bad at first, i would just noticed that the screen looked a little jumpy and that I would see, for lack of a better description, little glitchy lines. By Wednesday, It would freeze up, not allowing me to scroll to the other page on my phone and not letting me click on apps. I would have to double click my home screen button and then click it again to bring it back, in order to try and press an app. It would work. By today, I&rsquo;ve had to restart my phone several times in order to try to be able to click on an app and to scroll to other pages. I am also not able to take pictures as it won&rsquo;t let me press the button. Please for anyone looking st this product, please DO NOT purchase it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk">Junk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this screen 2 times already. First one worked for about a day until it became intermittent, then finally worked about 5% of the time. Bought the second in hopes that the first was just a fluke. Shows how uninformed that decision was. Second one worked for about 30 min until it started deciding when you can and cannot use the touch screen. Display is great, the digitizer (touch screen) is complete crap. Do not buy. Junk. Waste of Money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="screen-is-working-fine-except-for-two-issues">Screen is working fine, except for two issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just installed. Will try to update later to see long-term reliability.Screen is working fine, except for two issues. Ambient light sensor is not working and the screen went dark at left corner right after swapping but later went back to normal. Ambient light sensor has nothing to do with the kit, but it would be great to put special notice as to how to align this tricky part.The installation process was OK, the major dissatisfaction was with the screw driver (the one used for most of the screws). It was hard some times to loose the screws, but not sure if the problem was with the screw or the driver. The driver lost magnet in the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product!! Comes with everything you need. I would suggest watching a YouTube video to actually see how to do it because the instructions that are included are minimal. But definitely worth the money for this one. My phone looks brand new!!</p>
