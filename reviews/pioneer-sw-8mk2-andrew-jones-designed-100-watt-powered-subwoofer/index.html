<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="little-sub-that-could">Little sub that could</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took my time to look around, I was looking at many other brands. Some 100watt, 150 and upwards to 500. I looked at 8&rdquo;, 10&rdquo; and 12&rdquo; from all brands.Many bass bins are loaded but often over-power and I did not want something like that. I wanted something that could offer low thundering lows, while maintaining good frequency and not over-powering the Lows and Mids.I took a gamble on this as I thought this would be perfect for what i was wanting. My thoughts where right. It’s perfect. Anything bigger would have been too much.I call this the little sub that could. If I crank it all the way up its pretty powerful! I have the gain and frequency about halfway. I have this placed in the corner of the room. Keep in mind the speaker only sounds as good as to where it is placed. The sound waves need something to bounce off of&hellip; putting this in middle of the room will not do any good and placing it along the wall also won’t do much good. I found the corner works best&hellip; Just try multiple places until you find your sweet spot… The sub will be heard no matter where its location but if you want the true buety of thundering lows it needs to be placed just right. The gains and frequency also need to be rapidly adjusted until you find the sweet spot!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-match-for-audioengine-a2">Excellent match for Audioengine A2+</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this sub to use with Audioengine A2+ speakers on my computer. This sub is the perfect pairing for these speakers. Set the crossover on the sub to around 110, turn gain to roughly <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, and enjoy the sound. Admittedly this is not the sub for room shaking home theater bass. It shakes my office and does an excellent job matching the output of the A2+ (which is also better suited to a home office than a home theater setup). It is important to remember that it is an 8&rdquo; sub with 100 watts of output. It will pair great with small lower output systems and fits in small spaces. Sound is tight and clean. This sub delivers solid bass sound without excessive boom.If you have reasonable expectations, this subwoofer will not disappoint you. It is actually quite good for the price. You just need to keep in mind that this is not a larger, higher powered subwoofer. It certainly does not put out as much as the Klipsch R-12SW in my home theater setup, but it should not be expected to either. If you are considering this subwoofer for home theater use, I could see it working better if you used a pair of them instead of one. For the price two of these may be a reasonable substitute for more expensive larger single speakers.</p>

<h5 id="nice-addition-to-the-sound-system">nice addition to the sound system</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using the SW-8MK2 with a Sony STRDH550 AV Receiver, currently in 2.1 mode, along with the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR bookshelf pair. What I have is a smart TV with HDMI with ARC going to the receiver, so when TV is on, it turns on the receiver automatically. The sound is good, although I only have the TV&rsquo;s built-in speakers to compare to, so it&rsquo;s not saying much. The auto standby does work; when there is no sound signal, it turns off the blue LED on the front, but I have yet to measure the power consumption when it is off vs. on.</p>

<h5 id="we-love-love-love-this-sub-woofer-it-was-the-last-element">WE LOVE LOVE LOVE this sub-woofer it was the last element &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WE LOVE LOVE LOVE this sub-woofer it was the last element we added to our movie room we have it paired with the rest of the Pioneer surround system (two towers, two rear and one center speaker), an Epson projector and a drop down projection screen. The first time we used the sub we watched San Andreas and WOW there were times when the sub literally &ldquo;blew us away&rdquo; not kidding we kept feeling cold air on the major earthquake scenes and finally figured out it was the air that was being generated by the sub.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-compliment-to-the-other-andrew-jones-speakers">Excellent compliment to the other Andrew Jones speakers.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome entry level speakers. Bought as part of the 5.1 kit. Best sounding speakers I&rsquo;ve heard under $1k. I&rsquo;m using 2 of these along with 2 AJ towers and 4 AJ bookshelf surrounds in a 7.2.4 setup. The .4 are Polk Audio Atrium 4 speakers mounted to the ceiling as overhead Dolby Atmos speaakers. The setup sounds great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buzz-sound-coming-from-the-unit-after-just-a-few-days">Buzz sound coming from the unit after just a few days.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Original review: This sub replaced a Polk SW10 in a medium sized department. Very happy with this subwoofer IMHO it&rsquo;s way better choice than the Polk. The small footprint is also great.Updated review: After a few days of having this sub-woofer I noticed a buzz sound coming from it. I checked all the cables and everything looked OK. I unplugged the input signal and the buzz remains. I looked in the reviews and it seems that I&rsquo;m not the only one. Fortunately I still got the chance to return this item, I was glad with the quality of the bass but I don&rsquo;t want to risk a fire :(</p>

<h5 id="using-this-baby-outdoors">Using this baby outdoors!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was looking for a moderately priced subwoofer to supplement the hanging speakers on our covered porch and fill in the missing bass. Amazon had this baby on sale for less than $100, so I gave it a shot. Could not be happier. Extremely easy to set up. Played a bit with the gain/volume and crossover, and haven&rsquo;t touched it since. Fills in the missing bottom end out on the porch. Space it covers is infinite, of course, being outside. Covered porch is about 16x25. Really like this Pioneer SW-8MK2 and am pleased with its overall performance, especially considering the price and value. May purchase another one soon for my home office.</p>

<h5 id="4-1-2-stars">4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the entire Andrew Jones Designed speaker system.It loses <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> a star because set up can be time consuming and difficult with the speaker wire.Overall, for the price, this is a pretty good system. Provides solid sound for movies and music.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stuff">Great Stuff!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding for the price and completed my Andrew Jones surround setup. Can&rsquo;t say enough about this entire line from Pioneer&hellip;brilliant job! Sound vs price = huge value!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome sub for the money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mediocre">Mediocre</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not bad sub for the money, especially if you&rsquo;re not expecting a ton of output, however for a little more I think there is better value for the money on the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-a-few-months-and-its-emitting-a-rather-annoying-humming-sound">&hellip; product a few months and its emitting a rather annoying humming sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>had the product a few months and its emitting a rather annoying humming sound. besides that its a great subwoofer.. if theres a fix for the humming it would be amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-sound-for-the-price">awesome sound for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>sounds great good price</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I needed.. replace old expensive system that broke. Great sound for the $$</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-1">Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for me as a home theatre sub, price was very reasonable. I also think its better looking than most others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound-quality-at-an-unbelievable-price">Great sound quality at an unbelievable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound quality at an unbelievable price. I&rsquo;ve paired it with the rest of the pioneer sp series and a Sony str-dn1080 av receiver and have no complaints</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="boomer">Boomer!</h5>

<p>Works well and a great addition to my home theatre.</p>

<h5 id="loud-and-low-resonances-probably-caused-by-bad-design-or-loose-construction">Loud and low resonances probably caused by bad design or loose construction</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After about 3 weeks of low use, I noticed that there were extended periods (2-3 seconds, or more) of very loud bass vibration.</p>
