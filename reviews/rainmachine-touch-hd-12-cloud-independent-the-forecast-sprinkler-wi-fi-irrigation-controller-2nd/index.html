Run the programs one-at-a-time, sequentially or even in parallel! The RainMachine WIFI sprinkler timer is designed to handle possible conflicts, like simultaneous commands to the same valve or overlapping schedules.</p>

<p>NOAA. A weather ready nation.</p>

<p>Your RainMachine sprinkler controller connects via WIFI and gets the best weather data available on earth. NOAA employs satellites, radars, weather stations and highly qualified meteorologists, delivering the most accurate weather forecast on the planet. Complex mathematical models that run on huge data centers are free for you to use in your garden. Yes, free, already paid from your tax money. Using your exact street location, the RainMachine sprinkler timer downloads precise weather data, accommodating to specific micro-climates. Let it rain!</p>

<p>No data? No problem. Switch to statistics.</p>

<h5 id="i-think-i-finally-found-a-smart-irragation-controller-i-like-only-one-little-issue-to-resolve">I think I finally found a smart irragation controller I like&hellip; only one little issue to resolve</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the RainMachine HD-12 today from Amazon. I&rsquo;ve had several controller in the past&hellip; I started originally with a stock Rain Bird unit that was installed with my system. I immediately knew that it was not going to do the job, so a couple years back I moved to OpenSprinkler, a controller I built from a kit. This unit served me well, but the one feature I really wanted was the weather integration, which by the time it was available on OpenSprinkler my hardware was obsolete, which meant I was going have to upgrade hardware to take advantage of it. Since an upgrade was inevitable, I decided to take a look at what else was on the market. For better or worse (worse as it turned out) I decide to go with a Blossom controller. Blossom is fairly new to the market and I though they had a solid product. As it turned out, the hardware was great, but the software was riddled with issues. I sold the Blossom and today, after much research, I received the RainMachine HD-12. What drew me to this unit was the long track record, the open API, weather integration, the fact the unit could be totally controlled from the unit&rsquo;s touch screen (important if you have folks come to maintain your system) and most importantly the unit does not rely on a cloud service to run. If you are reading this review and trying to decide on a controller, in my opinion, this one single point should weigh heavy in your decision. If there is a problem with the service, the internet or the company just plain goes out of business&ndash; where does that leave you? It leaves you with not so smart of a controller.So, if I love the RainMachine so much way only four stars you may ask. Well, my brand new controller arrived with a defective zone. One of the 12 zones will not activate. I know that things are going to happen, so I&rsquo;m not so concerned about this one issue. What is more important to me is how a company stands behind their products&ndash; I think that says a lot. I have sent an email to their support and I&rsquo;m waiting to see how they handle my problem. From everything I&rsquo;ve read in other reviews about Green Electronics I have no reason to believe that I will get anything less then stealer service. Once I know more I will update my review.UPDATE: I was contacted by support within a couple hours and they informed me that I needed to do a firmware upgrade to fix my issue. The upgrade was a simple process that I completed from the Rainmachine app on my phone and only took a few minutes. After the upgrade my issue was resolved. I&rsquo;m impressed with the quick response from support and my HD-12 is working great now. I&rsquo;ll update my review again once I&rsquo;ve used the HD-12 for a while.UPDATE (9-25-16):I&rsquo;ve been using the Rain Machine for a while now and it still works as well as the day I purchased, no issues. Green Electronics has update the firmware a few times and has added additional features. One I really like is the ability to choose other weather data providers, such as Weather Underground. Weather Underground is a whole weather eco system on it&rsquo;s own, which allows me to get weather data from other user&rsquo;s stations, one as close as a mile from my home. If you pick multiple providers then it averages the data from all your choices. Using weather data to help control the amount of water I&rsquo;m using has saved me 80% over a conventinal &ldquo;set and forget&rdquo; stock controller&hellip; and that is a good return on my investment.</p>

<h5 id="internet-enabled-simple-to-use-lawn-looks-great-water-usage-is-down-tips-on-wiring-it">Internet enabled, simple to use, lawn looks great &amp; water usage is down&hellip; + Tips on wiring it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The rainmachine has worked out very well. I&rsquo;ve had it installed for several months and 3 criteria were defintely met:1) Lawn looks great2) Water usage is way down3) I can easily monitor activity from apps/webIt&rsquo;s fairly easy to setup once wired. Even though it has an easy &amp; simple touch interface, I primarily use the web and mobile apps (ios &amp; android) to make updates or mostly look at what its been doing, as the unit is in a remote, difficult location in the basement.I evaluated all of the watering the assumptions used for my old controller. I was able to use a 3 day field capacity versus 2 for most zones, and a short mid-day program for 3 &lsquo;hot zones&rsquo; in the sun. This causes it to water much less often and as a result use much less water. I could not have changed this on the old controller, as it had one setting and that was based on the worst case hot weather. The RM uses internet weather data adjusts!Wiring was my biggest challenge. I have (3) 13-wire bundles coming from the yard, and unfortunately those didn&rsquo;t line up neatly under the RM in a manageable way. In addition, multiple &lsquo;Common&rsquo; and &lsquo;Master valve&rsquo; wires did not easily &lsquo;jam&rsquo; into the RM&rsquo;s small terminals. My solution was to make a terminal wiring box from a Carlon junction box, terminals and a few feet of sprinkler wire&hellip; all from Home Depot. While it took a little time, its durable and manageable. Pictures are attached.Two things to be aware of,1) You have to have wifi to use the weather updates and mobile apps, and wifi has to reach the RM&rsquo;s installation location. It works without internet, but it will not know it rained, its cooler, etc to reduce watering2) If you have a master valve or pump, you can use it, but you will lose one of the 16 zones to that purpose (Zone 1 will be configured for pump/mv control).Finally, if you are an advanced technical user, the API is very thorough. I have an ISY home automation controller with Nodelink, and use it to push alerts to me when programs run and for how long. I also use it to drive my &lsquo;hot zones&rsquo; program so that it runs only when needed. I also have a Hydreon rain sensor on the ISY, and use readings from that to push delays into the RM&rsquo;s &lsquo;Snooze&rsquo; so it doesn&rsquo;t water.</p>

<h5 id="oustanding-application-of-technology-for-effective-water-management">Oustanding application of technology for effective water management.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The HD-12 has been in operation for two weeks. The programming was actually more simple than I had expected, and the flexibility of crafting your water schedule is terrific. There is access to programming areas that will allow (not required) to further adjust your programming&hellip; I added two additional weather stations operating in my locale (because I could) and adjusted a few zones to uniquely identify soil differences on my property. The APP works great, I don&rsquo;t need to get near the actual control box.</p>
