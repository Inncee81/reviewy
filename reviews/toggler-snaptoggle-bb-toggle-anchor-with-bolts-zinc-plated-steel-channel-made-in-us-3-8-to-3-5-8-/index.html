<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good, but a caution on use. make sure to have the base seated in the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch hole. I used a pair of needle nose pliers to make sure it is was pushed in and then I pulled out of the provided portion to make sure it was tight in the hole. I bought the ten pack for 2 projects, 4 for one and 6 for the other. One of the ones i was using broke off. maybe too much pressure on my end or defect on product. Other 9 worked flawless though. Mounted a Shower Grab bar and a Toilet Rail for my Elderly father. He is very light weight so no pressure on the items, but when I tested them they held up great.Worth the snag even though one broke.*Update: Company is sending me 4 new ones to replace the one broken one I am. Great Customer Service!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easier-and-stronger-than-the-old-school-togglers">Easier and stronger than the old-school togglers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In the &lsquo;80s I worked in a hardware store, so I grew up using the old, clumsy togglers where you need a fender washer and a lot of patience to get them to grip the wall and not fall apart. Then we moved to the plastic anchors that pull out of the wall if there is too much weight on them. Then the pound-and-screw anchors that just rip plaster apart.Now, snaptoggle togglers solve all the downsides of the other anchors. You need a drill and a screwdriver, and that is about it. No need for questionable stud-finders. No need to worry about the screw length. These are easy to install and a snap (literally) to set the right depth.I found the video on Amazon very helpful before I bought these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-perfectly">Worked perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used a couple of these to mount a guitar to a plaster wall. Just drilled a couple of pilot holes, then the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; holes (I found a spade bit works really well through plaster), then inserted the plastic pieces with the metal bar on the end through the holes. Pulled the plastic pieces back to get the metal bar seated against the back of the wall, ran the little &ldquo;cap&rdquo; up against the wall, and broke off the excess plastic strips. Then I put the wooden guitar hanger against the wall and ran the two screws in. The screws are very heavy duty and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d hold many times the weight of my guitar. I didn&rsquo;t have any problems with cross threading at all. Tightened the screws and wha-la! Beautiful and rock-solid installation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-may-cause-a-permanent-oops">Cheap, may cause a permanent &ldquo;oops&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use, but the plastic that you snap off does not pull tight enough. The bar in the back easily cross threads due to cheaper construction (which is not an issue in most cases) and once it cross threads the plastic no longer holds the metal bar still enough for the screw to fasten into. This results in needing to break the plastic and let the bar drop into the wall, wasting the piece. and leaving clutter inside the walls (not seen, but I know it is there, the perfectionist side of me is irritated).Second problem is that the metal bar may just spin once cross threaded&hellip;.not allowing the screw to tighten, or loosen. Just being stuck in place, spinning when you try to remove to fasten the screw. This would take cutting off the head to the screw in order to drop the material into the wall, or cutting out a large section of wall all together.Out of the three pieces I needed to use, one was wasted and is now in the wall, one spinning un-secured, and two help properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">WOW!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our studs are concrete&hellip; I swear. Only one drill could get through them and it was a plug in one and even that smoked. So, I did some research! Found these bad boys, GREAT deal for 10! We used 6 just to ease my anxiety and our TV is up high and looking good! That&rsquo;s a 32 inch LG. Not a newer TV. I think I bought it in 2009. These things are a life saver so we didn&rsquo;t have to ship back the mount!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-heavy-duty-wall-anchors">Best heavy duty wall anchors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The best heavy duty wall anchors. These are so much better than the spring type toggles purely for the fact that the bolt can be removed and reinstalled. Look at the load ratings to see if these will be sufficient for the application. The only downside is that when they are removed the hole to fill will probably be a bit bigger as the plastic collar has to be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-hollow-wall-fasteners">Great hollow-wall fasteners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These fasteners are fantastic, and by far the strongest hollow-wall faster I have found.The only issue I have had is when attempting to use them in a wall with closed-foam insulation, which did not allow the metal attachment piece to rotate parallel to the wall, but I had an issue when trying to use standard toggle hollow-wall fasteners. The difficulty with these particular fasteners arises in the installation, which requires the threaded portion of the fastener to be rotated parallel to the wall (then rotated to be perpendicular to accept the screw once fully inserted in the hollow-wall). I have not experienced this issue when installing the fastener with traditional fiberglass installation.I would defiantly not hesitate to purchase again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very optimistic when purchasing this product based on other reviews, but I was extremely disappointed. I had to redo a couple because the anchors kept falling off of the toggle into the wall, how is that possible? I followed the instructions and did everything correctly. I was mounting a TV so I needed 4 total, I would sometimes get to the fourth screw and it would push the anchor out&hellip; then have to undo all of them. It was a disaster. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this product as it&rsquo;s not well made. I&rsquo;ve used other toggles in the past and have never had this experience.</p>

<h5 id="snaptoggle">Snaptoggle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked all around my area for this product in order to hang two televisions on brackets into metal studs. I was so happy to have found these and they worked perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="the-absolute-best-heavy-duty-anchor-for-drywall">The absolute best heavy duty anchor for drywall!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have gone through boxes and boxes of these. They are terrific!!! I have never worked with a better fastener for drywall.</p>

<h5 id="glad-i-found-you">Glad I found you!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought the wrong size&hellip;. F***!!!!But they work as advertised. Really glad i found this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great">worked great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked great and was really easy to use. I used it with a TV wall mount in steel studs. I mounted a 40&rdquo; TV on a swiveling arm (for a corner).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-easy-to-use-works-great">Super easy to use - works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are awesome - and SUPER easy to use&hellip; Just follow the directions and you can hang up sagging shelves, bathroom hardware, and whatever else you need to hang, without needing&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="a-great-wall-anchor-solution-but">A great wall anchor solution but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great solution but&hellip;&hellip;a couple of the supplied bolts had faulty threads. Check the threads before you start installation. It will save you a lot of frustration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked exactly for the task needed. The only little drawback is the holes have to be a half inch in diameter to get the toggle through.</p>
