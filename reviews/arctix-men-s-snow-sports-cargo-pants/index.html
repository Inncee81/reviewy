<h5 id="great-ski-pants-for-men">Great ski pants for men</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband wears a 38 pants but skinner legs. I bought the extra large and they fit him perfect. He said they were extra warm and he loved all the pockets in them and the color. He&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;11 and the length fit him good with the snow boots.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="information-on-sizes-and-material">INFORMATION ON SIZES AND MATERIAL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased three pairs of these snowboard pants in two different sizes and styles, due to poor details provided.SIZES: The pants have a strap which can be pulled tight to fit a wider range of waist sizes. Overall, these pants run large. A size small fits a 32” waist 32” length with about an extra ½” room on the waist (with strap pulled tight) which was perfect. The medium fits a 36” waist 32” length loosely with about ¾” room on the waist. For a size 36” the small will fit but are too tight. The lengths seemed to be the same between the small and the medium, both being about 32”. The pants do have belt loops which can be used, and they do feel pretty durable.MATERIAL: The material varies between the cargo style, and the non-cargo style. The pants with cargo pockets is a softer, thicker, quieter, nylon material. They’re much more like the pants I find in stores for almost twice the cost of these ones. The non-cargo pants are a thinner, cheaper and a louder material. Personally, I cannot stand the loud sound of snow pants swishing together, so I definitely prefer the cargo pocket style. The pants do not have any vents on them for cooling, so although they have less insulation than some others, they are plenty warm even on top of the mountain with the usual thermal wear underneath.Overall, I think these pants are a great value especially for someone who uses them a few times a year. Hope I’ve helped you to make a more educated decision.READ MORE</p>

<p>Size large is what I ordered and they just fit with no room to tighten or wear anything but Smartwool 250g underneath which is how I planned to wear them anyways. I&rsquo;m 6ft 220 right now with a 36 waist. I plan on loosing 20lbs so the size to waist should be fine. I could have easily been happy with the X large.The fit is attractive as well as the style if you&rsquo;re into that part of it. They look nice and the snow camo is OK with the rest of my winter camp gear. Lots of features.I bought these for walking the dog in the forest and maybe might use them for x country ski or snowboarding. For short coyote hunts they are probably good. I mean, they can be used for anything but the durability might be questionable since most the seams are single stitch. Based on what I know about destroying out door clothing I would say these are good for the lighter side of abuse. I&rsquo;m just basing that assumption on the stitching.Front pockets are a bit small in my opinion. Good size belt loopsAll in all I rate these 5 stars based on the price. There is better stuff out there for sure but you will pay three times more for it.Great low cost good looking outdoor wear.READ MORE</p>

<p>If you look around there are sometimes you can find a gem in a product that is cheap and also holds high value. Case and point where a bought a name brand pair of ski pants from a department store for almost nothing. I loved those pants but after 10 years are beginning to show their age. So wanted a new pair. In this case I really wanted a blue pair of ski pants, which in my shopping experience is hard to find. But here comes Arctix.First the fit. Its way off. The fit of these pants is WAYYY to big. So much so there is no chance for a large, a size I usually wear would not stay up without belt or suspenders. So I exchanged for a medium and they fix nicely. The look is awesome, love the color. The issue stems with the material. Its like wearing insulated pants out of plastic bags. There was absolutely no ventilation in these pants. Once you put them on and sweat a little bit your legs are soaked and likely cold because of it. I am past my return window so these will be put in the donation pile. Its just a real shame, even a simple ventilation zipper on each leg would make a huge difference to remove the moisture on those warmer days. I just cannot fathom wearing these on the very cold days wither for the moisture issue that is caused. I would stay away. Buy a good pair even at a high price&hellip; they will likely last you many many years.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="ok-winter-pants">OK winter pants</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a few things I was looking for when I purchased these pants.#1 Wind/Water proof or resistantThe upside is that these pants seem to be completely windproof in my experience. Standing in 30mile wind and feeling no wind seeping through. However, they are not very water resistant. I tested in light rain condition and after 10 mins or so moisture started to soak in.#2 Quality of builtI have noticed some loose stitches when I first wore these. After a day&rsquo;s use some strings got a bit loose. I don&rsquo;t think these pants would last a long time, at least the ones that I got.#3 WarmthVery warm. If there&rsquo;s one thing these pants do best, it&rsquo;s its ability to keep your nice and warm in cold weather.In conclusion:Starting at 5 stars, -1 at water resistance and -1 at built. Overall 3 stars.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="pant-tastic">Pant&rsquo;tastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been discouraged at the price of a complete ski package, retail stores wanted 300-1000 for a complete used package. I put together a package much cheaper, including these ski pants. Well insulated, free movement, expandable elastic waist with belt loops in case you burn come pounds on the sloops :). The zippers are high quality and the cargo pockets are perfect for accessing with gloves on. I saw comparable pants at the ski shops from 500-700 dollars.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="after-reading-the-reviews-i-decided-to-size-up-to-xxl-and-they-fit-great-and-were-comfortable">After reading the reviews I decided to size up to XXL and they fit great and were comfortable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these for myself as a last minute desperate need to go snowboarding. I am normally sz16 or XL. After reading the reviews I decided to size up to XXL and they fit great and were comfortable. I wore them with a base layer the first day and didn&rsquo;t really need to because they kept the cold out great. The second day in 15-20° I went without the base layer and was fine. My biggest issue was the length&hellip; Way to long and big. My husband said that they looked like bellbottom pants. I ended up walking on the bottoms a lot or hiking up my pants while walking which was a total pain. They were about 6&rdquo;or more too long. I am 5&rsquo;5&rdquo; so a guy would most likely not have this issue.READ MORE</p>

<p>Surprisingly needed a medium after trying a large, which does line-up with their sizing chart. I&rsquo;m typically a 34x34, length not being a major issue for ski pants.</p>
