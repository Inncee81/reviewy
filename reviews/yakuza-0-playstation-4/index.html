</ul>

<p>The glitz, glamour, and unbridled decadence of the 80s are back in Yakuza 0. A prequel to the long-running series set in Japan&rsquo;s criminal underworld, this entry introduces mainstay protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and series regular Goro Majima as they fight like hell through Tokyo and Osaka in their climb through the yakuza ranks. Along the way, players can interact with all the vices 1988&rsquo;s Japan had to offer: from discos and hostess clubs to classic SEGA arcades, there are tons of distractions to pursue in the richly detailed, neon-lit world.At its heart, Yakuza 0 is a classic 3D brawler, where players roaming the streets of Tokyo or Osaka will encounter all manners of goons, thugs, hoodlums, and lowlifes to beat up. Featuring an engaging combat system allowing players to switch between three different fighting styles instantaneously, Yakuza 0 gives players fluid, free-flowing fights that are easily learned and a joy to master. Take combat up a notch by using environmental objects such as bicycles, sign posts, and car doors for bone-crunching combos and savage take-downs.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-entry-into-the-series">Perfect entry into the series</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As someone whose never played a Yakuza game before, I&rsquo;ve been completely blown away. The story is gripping and intense, the combat is fun and satisfying, and the side missions are incredibly goofy and entertaining distractions from the main story. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to jump into the series with this game, it is well worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-wonderful-game-that-is-at-once-the-most-absurd-and-the-most-serious-that-you-ll-ever-play">A wonderful game that is at once the most absurd and the most serious that you&rsquo;ll ever play</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of reviews try to win people over with an endless list of amusing anecdotes - winning chickens in a bowling game and making them a real estate manager. Training a dominatrix to be more assertive. Obliterating people in combat with a motorcycle.It&rsquo;s all true, of course. Yakuza 0 can be an immensely funny and absurd game with moments that&rsquo;s genuinely make you laugh out loud - largely because you could have never expected them.But I also think that&rsquo;s had the side effect of selling the game short. You might think this is a comedy game, something that is almost lighthearted or trivial.It&rsquo;s not.Yakuza 0 is a very serious game - a fact you might find surprising. Its plot is complex and is centered on a fairly dry subject of real estate intrigue in a booming market. It deals with mature, often terrible issues and has a cast of immensely realistic - and likable - characters set in an equally realistic city. Yakuza has the pacing and tone of a drama, and it must be enjoyed slowly like one.The comedy, then, is not the driver of this game, but rather serves as a much needed relief of tension. It&rsquo;s almost like there&rsquo;s a swinging pendulum in which the game is allowed to present you with increasingly intense and dramatic moments so long as it&rsquo;s all offset by an equally increasing level of absurdity. It helps space out the moments of self-seriousness in a way that just&hellip;works.Beyond just the tone and story is a very enjoyable brawler that constantly mixes it up with minigames, tough bosses, and other diversions. I do want to stress that this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a game you&rsquo;re coming back to for the gameplay - rather, you&rsquo;ll be coming for the story, the characters, the city itself.This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, though, and I wish more games would take this approach. Yakuza 0 is a wonderful game.</p>

<h5 id="the-gameplay-was-fun-a-mix-of-3d-fighter-and-rpg">The gameplay was fun, a mix of 3D fighter and RPG</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first YAKUZA game of the franchise, and as a brand new fan I was immediately drawn into the story. The gameplay was fun, a mix of 3D fighter and RPG, and the substories and things to do while in town were never boring (though you&rsquo;d probably need basic knowledge of mahjong, shogi. koi-koi, or other traditional Japanese/Chinese games if you haven&rsquo;t played them before, learning within this game is difficult). I understand now how this franchise is so legendary. I actually pre-ordered Yakuza Kiwami halfway playing this and cannot wait for release! I definitely recommend it for fans of this genre and especially if you&rsquo;re into more cinematic and movie style over-the-top story telling. All the basic gangster tropes are there and some you see coming a mile away, but the execution is never boring.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-first-yakuza-game-pretty-fun">My first Yakuza Game, Pretty Fun!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first game in the series and I&rsquo;m now halfway through the game so figured I&rsquo;d give my 2 cents. It&rsquo;s kinda slow going and there is a ton of dialog, but the story and characters are very well done so it keeps your attention. Graphically some may say it looks last gen but honestly it looks just fine to me. The city you walk around in isn&rsquo;t very huge compared to other open world type games but there&rsquo;s quite a bit to do as far as side quests and mini games along with the normal story quests so there&rsquo;s plenty to keep you playing. The fighting can be quite repetitive but it&rsquo;s also silly and funny at times and it controls well enough. I&rsquo;d definitely play another one so I&rsquo;ll likely be buying the remaster of the first game coming out soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="おつかれ-sega">おつかれ Sega</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Japanese renaissance continues. Along with Persona 5, Nier: Automata and Nioh, Yakuza 0 is another fantastic purely one of a kind experience from Japan. It is a true job well done from Sega. There may not be anything completely new here if you&rsquo;ve played other games in the series, but even judged on it&rsquo;s own or as a prequel. Yakuza 0 is bonkers, pulp nonsense. And it is downright artistic more often than not. While not truly an open world game - it&rsquo;s often very linear, the game delights more with the details and side activities than with the overall game design. There may be a peppering of long in the tooth JRPG random battles as you walk through the streets. There may be Guitar Hero style karaoke sing alongs. And there may be button mashing combat encounters, all of which you may have seen hundreds of times in dozens in other games, but none with the dry humor or atmosphere of Yakuza. I could make a list of all the small frustrations you could encounter in the game too, but this game is almost above any sort of focused criticism. Yakuza is just a good time and it maybe even one of the best gangster tales told in the last 15 years too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-prelude">Perfect Prelude</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Highly underrated game and series as a whole. The framerate and fidelity alone could sell this, but the wild gameplay steps in and ramps things up before the player has any time to doubt. Yakuza comes at you swinging from the get go, and you have a punishing arsenal to fight back with. The two main characters have a truly impressive ability to weaponize nearly any object in Japan, and the effect makes for an extremely cinematic and satisfying aesthetic and feel. Everything here is game-ified. Long reviews have been written about how this title is extremely effective and while I wholeheartedly agree, I&rsquo;m here to simply inform the consumer about what I feel to be one of the best playing console games released since&hellip; well Nioh. Keep it up Sony, we&rsquo;re all counting on Yakuza Kiwami, which you will absolutely want to check out if you enjoy this &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; romp through the gang lifestyle in Japan.Also, did I mention this thing runs at a near perfect 60 frames per second? Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="best-game-in-the-series-yet">Best game in the series yet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yakuza 0 is the best reason to own a Playstation 4 right now. As with every game in the series, it&rsquo;s the perfect mix of beat-em-up and JRPG wrapped up in an engaging story.</p>
