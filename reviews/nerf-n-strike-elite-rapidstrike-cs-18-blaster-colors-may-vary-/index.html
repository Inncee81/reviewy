<h5 id="simply-amazing">Simply amazing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, let me say. THIS BLASTER IS AMAZING. I got this for 19.99 from amazon (STEAL!) and I am amazed. This blaster is awesome looking, has amazing fire rate, and has the most comfortable hand hold I have ever felt on a nerf gun. It comes with a clear 18 round mag. The mag has rubber shoe like things at the bottom to keep it stable while standing. The stock is collapsible, but if any of you are familiar with the raider cs-35 stock, it has multiple positions. This does not. The stock is either in or out. A real plus is it has only 4 C batteries instead of the 6 D batteries it took to run the stampede. This blaster is flywheel, unlike the stampede (which was plunger) and it has a FAST rate of fire! 3.6 darts PER SECOND. It also accepts barrel attachments (A plus) except for the longstrike barrel. Hmm wonder why? It has 5 tactical rails. Another plus is the secondary trigger that revs the motor, so you never happen to leave it on and drain the batteries, unlike the stampede, which has a switch. This blaster is very light too. Only around 4 pounds. Overall, I would suggest, no, MAKE someone choose this blaster if I could. I love it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it. His mother tells me that he ignored all of his other Christmas presents and wouldn&rsquo;t put this thing down for days. He&rsquo;s younger than what the age groups that the package lists, but he seems to be doing fine with it.</p>

<h5 id="better-living-through-superior-firepower">Better living through superior firepower</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I have two young nieces and a nephew who stay with us on weekends when their parents need a break. It&rsquo;s fun for everyone, but the kids all have their own Nerf weaponry, and I got tired of being their prime target, so a couple of years ago, I got my own Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS, and we&rsquo;ve had some nice little wars in the yard (my wife won&rsquo;t let us play inside unless it&rsquo;s raining). But with three of them, I was still outgunned. Until I got the Elite Rapidstrike CS-18 Blaster, that is. With the longer range and superior rate of fire, those poor kids will never know what hit them. I&rsquo;ll make mincemeat of them.But just how good is the CS-18? I&rsquo;d say pretty doggone good. First and obvious, the transparent magazine is a real plus, letting you see exactly how many rounds you have left. And it doesn&rsquo;t take long to empty the clip. The rate of fire is noticeably higher than my Stampede ECS, thanks to the motorized flywheel drive that speeds up the firing mechanism. I fired off four magazines (72 darts) without a jam, but these were new darts still in pristine condition, so there shouldn&rsquo;t be many jams. If you do get a jam, the port under the top rail allows easy access to clear it. I didn&rsquo;t try to measure the maximum range, but I fired a clip from my front porch, which is about forty-five feet from the street, and some shots were landing almost on the other side of the street, so it had to be at least 60 feet. There are five tactical rails for gripping, and three attachment points for a sling. Aiming is easy, with front and rear sights.There&rsquo;s no assembly required, but the CS-18 won&rsquo;t operate without 4 C batteries. You&rsquo;ll need a small Phillips screwdriver to remove three screws that hold the battery compartment under the barrel.Summary: This is a really cool Nerf gun, the most fun to shoot of any Nerfs that I&rsquo;ve used. Go up against any other Nerf gun, and the unfortunate person you&rsquo;re firing at will be running up the white flag pretty quick.There are some nice YouTube videos about the CS-18 Blaster. If you search on YouTube, the one dated May 21, 2013 is one of the best.Note: The only un-fun part of shooting a Nerf gun is picking up the darts afterward, especially for grownups like me with arthritis and a history of back surgeries. It would be great if Nerf could design a picker-upper device. I use a reacher made for people who have limited range of motion, but it&rsquo;s designed for picking things up that are heavier than a Nerf dart. For a dart, it could be a very lightweight, simple device. It&rsquo;s just a thought.</p>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure if &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; is a word you can apply to a Nerf gun, but if so, this one deserves it.All the triggers and mag release are easily accessible and logically arranged, there are lots of accessory rails, auto fire is smooth an pretty fast even stock, this is one very nice Elie Alpha Trooper primary gun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-vast-improvement-over-the-stampede-and-vulcan">A Vast Improvement Over the Stampede and Vulcan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the very few fully automatic dart guns Nerf has ever made, this one is simply the best. It is smaller, lighter, quieter, and shoots at a faster rate than either the Stampede or the Vulcan.It has a well-made feel to it (as most of Nerf&rsquo;s dart guns do), it feels comfortable, and there are no parts that creak as if they&rsquo;re going to fall off. It&rsquo;s also nowhere near as finicky about being used as the Stryfe, which I think set the high bar for being annoying about having a zillion-and-one ways and so-called reasons for stopping you from firing it.It is possible to do single-shot firing, as well as just holding the trigger to spray darts. The only caveat is that you have to disciplined enough to remember to continuously hold the lower trigger to keep the flywheel motors running &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t, then single-shot firing can easily result in jamming on a dart.It is a shame that they&rsquo;re selling this with just an 18-dart clip &ndash; at least the Stampede was shipped in an elaborate kit that included multiple clips and a bandolier belt to carry them. This gun deserves to be provided with a similar set of equipment. But, to be honest, this gun doesn&rsquo;t really come into its own unless you use the 35-dart drum magazine with it. I&rsquo;ve tried this combination, and it really makes this the complete keep-your-enemy&rsquo;s-head-down kind of gun.There are only three complaints that I would put against it&hellip;1) The motors driving the flywheels really are noisier than they need to be &ndash; the motors in the Stryfe are definitely quieter.2) The ability to attach barrel extensions to the front of this gun is not well implemented &ndash; almost all of the barrel extensions wobble in place a bit when attached to the front. On the other hand, this gun is already sufficiently long that it&rsquo;s hard to see why you would want to make it much longer &ndash; maybe Nerf has some other forthcoming barrel extension in mind?3) The battery compartment really should have been put towards the rear of this gun &ndash; with the battery compartment being built in up front, this gun is a bit nose-heavy, which makes one-handed operation a little unrealistic &ndash; if the battery compartment had been put towards the back, the weight of the four C-cells could have been supported by a fore-arm.Only the first complaint is what I would call a significant one &ndash; the noisy flywheel motors take away any possibility of sneaking up on somebody with this with the motors running. It&rsquo;s the one advantage that the Stampede and Vulcan have over this gun &ndash; neither of those guns needed to make a sound at all until you were ready to pull the trigger. If you carry this dart gun with you, you&rsquo;ll need to have a simpler manually-operated spring-type dart gun for that initial sneak-attack shot &ndash; and then you can use this dart gun to spray darts when everyone already knows you&rsquo;re there.I recommend this.An update &ndash; 11/6/13&hellip;I still recommend this dart gun. However, I also recommend setting aside its 18-dart clear plastic clip and picking up one of the 35-dart drum magazines to use with it, instead. Having had this dart gun for a while, I&rsquo;m noticing that the spring in the 18-dart clear plastic clip seems to have become somewhat weaker, and the something about the plastic that the clip is made from somehow causes or enables a great deal of friction between the tips of the dart and the interior of the clip. As a result, the darts don&rsquo;t immediately move up the clip as they are fired, which appears to be leading to frequent jamming.The 35-drum magazines seem to be made of a plastic that doesn&rsquo;t suffer from this weird friction issue &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually a difference in the plastic material or maybe a slight difference in smoothness of the interior that causes differences in friction &ndash; but the darts do seem to stick more to the interior of the new clear 18-dart clip. Also, frankly, the 35-dart drum was always the better choice for a dart gun like this, anyway. It can go through darts so quickly with its rapid rate of fire that an 18-dart clip is used up too quickly.</p>
