<h5 id="it-works-and-i-know-it-works-because-it-saved-me-thousands">It works! And I know it works because it saved me thousands!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, folks &hellip; I just got down the ladder from the soffit on my roof &hellip; where I had installed this little device about 4 or 5 years ago with a new exterior antenna setup on my roof. I have instantly fallen in love with this product. Here&rsquo;s why: We have experienced storms here in Austin over the past couple of weeks and our TV reception all of a sudden was crappy to non-existent after we returned home from work a few days ago. This morning, I went up on the roof to check on my antenna setup. The antenna was obviously struck by lightning. There were black scorch marks all over the antenna as well as the cabling &hellip; right down to this little device. Yes, it was fried as well &hellip; it did exactly what it is designed to do. Everything from this little device into the home is still perfect. This device just paid for itself a hundred times over and saved three very expensive flat screen TVs and a number of other electronics. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Obviously, 5 stars and highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="great-price-installation-easy">Great price! Installation easy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It came later than expected. It was packed nicelyAfter only having my smart TV for a few months, i was disappointed to find the lightning hit the cable and damaged the Jack and the cable box. I had a surge protector for the other things, but didn&rsquo;t get around to purchasing a surge protector for the cable. I suppose i&rdquo;m lucky it only damaged the jack and the cable boxAfter reading the reviews i decided on this product for the price i thought it was worth a try. It doesn&rsquo;t come with screws eg, just the surge protector.Installation wasn&rsquo;t hard-you screw on the coaxial ends, (make sure its grounded).I took a photo for you to see. Everything seems okay, didn&rsquo;t expect it to be a problem, but everything still running at high speed.I will have to give an update when lightening hits.I hope this is helpful</p>

<h5 id="one-might-want-to-wrap-sound-insulation-about-this-device-best-i-can-describe-it-is-it-s-like-a-bull">One might want to wrap sound insulation about this device - best I can describe it is it&rsquo;s like a bull &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This device has worked at least five times, (the last three times - at least 4 apartments lost there cable &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; - most of them were people that recently moved in - assume newer cable modems/converters or whatever). I do have a splitter at the output of this suppressor which is also grounded, this theoretically could or would help for various reasons. One might want to wrap sound insulation about this device - best I can describe it is it&rsquo;s like a bull whip being snapped very close to you if you are within ten feet of this device, remote possibility the high &ldquo;EMP&rdquo; was pick up by my speakers, will pay attention to that detail the next time. (I will eventually get around to the sound suppression part if needed. Reason for minus one star - installation instructions could be much better: a) Do not coil the grounding wire (this creates inductance which can delay the suppressor activating), b) Instruction should state do not make any sharp (right angle or close) turns, in the cable into the suppressor, and no sharp turns change in direction of the ground wire - this can delay the suppressor from activating, I not going into details on this aspect.</p>

<h5 id="prevented-damage-but-caused-slowness-and-disconnects-from-the-frist-day">Prevented damage, but caused slowness and disconnects from the frist day.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I installed this after first losing a router and ethernet port on my PC, then losing the cable modem, a TV, two consoles, another router, and the ethernet port on another PC. When I went to install it I found that the existing grounding wire was just hanging loose in the box, barely connected to the previously installed grounding block. That, combined with having underground cable coming to the house, probably explained why I was having so much trouble. Anyhow I went ahead and installed the thing, and made sure the grounding wire was tightly clamped.I didn&rsquo;t lose any more equipment, but after installing this I had nothing but trouble with the signal. My new cable modem would cycle and lose connection on a weekly basis. Today it was so bad I could barely stay connected for more than 10 minutes. I went back outside and put the old grounding block back in place, making sure the ground wire was secure. Internet is back up and speed tests are showing higher speed than I&rsquo;ve seen in months.I understand these things deteriorate over time as lightning comes through, but I had trouble with this unit from day one. Now I&rsquo;m left with a difficult decision; get another one and possibly face more connection problems? Or cross my fingers and hope that, with a properly grounded connection, I&rsquo;ll be okay without this?We were in our other house only about 2 blocks away for over 10 years with never any surge related issues, and we do get some pretty crazy storms around here. Maybe we&rsquo;ll be okay. I work remotely sometimes for my I.T. job, so having a fast stable connection is critical. This unit compromised my connection too much, so I&rsquo;ll probably not be replacing it.</p>

<h5 id="protect-your-catv-equipment">Protect your CATV equipment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking CATV installers hate to see these things because in general, they do fail at times and create more of a work load and truck rolls for the &ldquo;cable guy&rdquo;. That being said, if you own your own cable modem and have several cable card Tivo&rsquo;s as I do, you will want to protect your investment in your own equipment. This is a gas discharge device as opposed to a MOV type device. MOV devices do tend to fail far more often, I have removed many MOV based catv surge protectors in the past. It also makes for a good grounding block. It will handle a 10 gauge wire. I always mount these next to the main electrical service paneland run a thick green wire to it from the service panel. ground. The savy electrical inspectors love it. I don&rsquo;t have any direct experience with the surge stopping capabilities of this device. The Tii web site has additional information.</p>

<h5 id="prevention-is-much-better-than-a-cure">Prevention is much better than a cure.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cox Cable is an unnecessary expense. I finally revolted, ordered an old-fashioned type antenna (less than $60) and installed on my roof using the existing cable, screwed right into the back of my TV. Receive HD just fine and tons of over-the-air channels. Got this surge protector as we often have flash storms with thunder and lightening, 6 years later, there&rsquo;s never been a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightning-insurance">Lightning insurance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I installed a rooftop antenna, put this in just before the coaxial entered the house, it just makes sense to protect my TV from any surges.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s relatively heavy for its size. It has Underwriter&rsquo;s Laboratories mark on it, so I presume it had to undergo testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-really-needed">not really needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say where it installed at , not on directions, they say I bought a warranty, don&rsquo;t have a clue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="then-to-make-matters-worse-i-find-out-the-item-is-not-eligible-to">Then to make matters worse I find out the item is not eligible to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not work with my Spectrum internet. Modem would not get signal once connected. I removed it a signal returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="only-kind-to-buy-for-surge-protection-no-reduction-in-line-speed">Only kind to buy for surge protection. No reduction in line speed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality. Still working just fine after massive power surge. No reduction in my internet speed after placing it inline with my coax line (mounted outside)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thanks-highly-recommended-going-to-buy-another">THANKS Highly Recommended! Going to buy another</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW! As advertised + BLAZING FAST shipping = A+ DEAL! THANKS Highly Recommended! Going to buy another!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-installation">Easy installation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installation was simple following the instructions. I recommend using #10 or thicker for the ground wire, the instructions recommend #12.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>nice and working perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-db-signal-loss-everything-still-works">3 db signal loss, everything still works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Added this guy right before the splitter going to the TiVo and Cable modem, signal strength went down about 3 db but all the channels still come in so no worse off than I was&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-insurance-policy-you-hope-you-never-need-it-and-hope-it-pays-when-you-do">Good insurance policy&hellip; You hope you never need it, and hope it pays when you do.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an insurance policy. I bought one for cable, and one for DirecTV. I noticed the cable company connected only a splitter, and didn&rsquo;t even ground it.</p>
