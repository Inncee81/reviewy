<h5 id="this-spray-magically-cleaned-my-house">This spray magically cleaned my house!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff litterally smells like ass. Bad Ass. Horrible Ass. You need to go to the doctor Ass. Tried it out last night on my boyfriend. Here is a summary of my night:5pm: Boyfriend on laptop in livingroom. He had been there for hours, so I decided it was time for him to get up.5:05pm: Sprayed Liquid Ass three times on a sweater in the other room, then nonchalantly dropped it in the livingroom, about ten feet away from the boyfriend,5:06pm: Boyfriend asks if I forgot to turn the bathroom fan on.5:08pm: Boyfriend comments on how stinky the cats poop is.5:15pm: Boyfriend, with his shirt covering his nose, scoops all three cat boxes in hopes of eliminating the wretched stench.5:45pm: Boyfriend goes on a mad hunt, insisting that the cats must have crapped somewhere in the house. By this time, the smell has engulfed the appartment (a small two bedroom.) He picks up every piece of laundry on the floor, throws the bathroom mats in the washing machine and finds a face mask and gloves to put on. (I am a nurse and keep some supplies at home.)6:25pm: Boyfriend becomes convinced the cats must have stepped in poo and tracked it all over the house. After smelling all four of the cats, he decides the cats must have cleaned themselves by now, At this point, after seeing all of the good this spray had done, I sprayed it thrice more; once in each bedroom and once in the livingroom.6:30pm: Boyfriend sweeps and mops all of the tiled floors, sprinkles baking soda over the carpet and vacuums the entire place. Durring this time, I make sure my bottle is hidden really well. I can&rsquo;t afford to get caught on this one.7:30pm: Boyfriend becomes convinced there must be spoiled food somewhere. He takes out the trash and loads the dishwasher.11pm: While finishing up the laundry, Boyfriend discovered the sweater. He decides the cat must have wiped his paws on it and says we need to make an appointment with the vet because the smell is concerning.I will be using this spray about once a month for the rest of my life. Thank you, Liquid Ass. Thank you.</p>

<p>This stuff&hellip; was good enough to get me suspended from school.. that&rsquo;ll be enough to tell you how it smells.</p>

<h5 id="liquid-ass-a-practical-application">Liquid Ass, a practical application.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So this stuff is absolutely horrendous. Believe me, it is aptly named. So we are all aware of the comedic value of this, but I wanted to present a very practical use for all of you parents.Earlier tonight, the boys and I got into one of our nerf/ wrestling matches, as the wife was off at art class, and so, naturally, we take the opportunity to raise holy hell while she is away. My boys are 10, 8, and 5, and they live for this. So anyways, they run into the bathroom and barricade themselves in and won&rsquo;t come out. I tried faking walking away, hiding in another room until their curiosity gets the better of them, etc.; all the standard fare. Well, this time they just stayed in there giggling and whispering to each other. Well, I quickly formed a plan to evict them from their foxhole, largely because my wife would be getting home and I needed to have the kids in bed and the house cleaned up. So I went and grabbed my little bottle of Liquid Ass, took it back down the hall quietly, and carefully sprayed two full spritzes under the door. All went quiet behind the door, and then I hear, &ldquo;What was that noise?&rdquo; Then all went quiet. About 15 seconds later I hear, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Then silence, then, &ldquo;WHAT IS THAT SMELL?!&rdquo; They all begin screaming in a panic and falling over each other trying to vacate the bathroom and flee down the hall. I&rsquo;m on the sofa with tears coming down my cheeks laughing like a madman. It was marvelous! They were trying desperately to figure out what it was that made such a terrible smell, but as all dads know, you don&rsquo;t reveal your secrets. ;) Anyways, a bit of simple green and the house fan quickly cleared up the stench before my wife got home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I keep a bottle of this in my car. The last time I got pulled over I sprayed a sock I keep in there with it. 1 spray. That is all. As I rolled down my window for the Officer he took a step back, I told him I knew I was speeding, but I don&rsquo;t know if you can tell, I urgently need to get home to wash myself and change clothes&hellip; I fear it is seeping into the upholstery. I was let off with a warning.Other useful uses:In a hall to move noisy people into their home.In a cracked window of a car because they took your parking spot.Spray while passing a line of people for a product or movie to shorten it.Spray in a few places to get someone to clean.Spray on your daughter to make sure she doesn&rsquo;t have sex at the party.Use on a door to keep door-knocking-religious-groups away.Spray on ceiling of class room to cancel class.Use on self so no one can steal your virginity.Use at any gathering that you want to be over more quickly.Mix with pepper spray so your assailant can be found easier.Use at Trump Rally.Sticks and stones will break their bones but Liquid Ass will give them PTSD.Should replace Riot Control tear gas.Bear Repellent.Skunk Repellent.Living being repellent.</p>

<p>I work in a sewage treatment plant, when I sprayed this 3 times in the air just before people arrived for our morning safety talk, everyone was gagging&hellip;concensus was it something from one of the digesters. It smells very similar to the rotten crap that flows through the plant.</p>

<h5 id="oh-the-stench-i-bought-this-as-a">Oh the stench!! I bought this as a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh the stench!! I bought this as a gag gift for my husband to use on his buddies at work. He got me with it as we&rsquo;re cleaning out the shed, secretly spraying 3-4 times as I&rsquo;m digging thru a box. I cannot explain the smell. I thought something had died in the box I grabbed. I continued digging thru it for all of 2 seconds before I started gagging. The shed reeked!! I couldn&rsquo;t get out fast enough!!</p>
