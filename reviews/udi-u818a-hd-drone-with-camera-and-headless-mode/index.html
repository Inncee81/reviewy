<blockquote>
<p>Two batteries, oh how much of a difference two batteries makes. If you have a portable battery charger you can have fun for hours. Odd place to start my review but I really love that USA Toyz thought to do this. Now for a more organized reviewDurability:I&rsquo;ve owned 4 other flying RC copters and 3 out of the 4 didn&rsquo;t make it through the testing. I get these products for free in exchange for a review so I do my best to beat them up. This quad copter holds up great and with plenty of included replacement parts you don&rsquo;t have to worry if your large intoxicated uncle sits on it. I&rsquo;ve bumped, banged and dropped this copter from a number of locations to a number of surfaces without issue.Functionality:Sturdy with options for correction. The remote holds the keys to a number of available corrections but i&rsquo;ll get into that later. The copter flys steady, true and high. The camera and video function are easy to pick up. The picture above a truck was taken on a windy day. Simplistic in design the rings look like colorful oversized soda can plastic rings but it works.Remote:The remote resembles a hard core kids toy remote that packs a bunch of buttons for looks. The difference here is that these things all have a function. It shows the acceleration speed in clear large numbers as well as the adjustments that you have made.Fun:It all boils down to fun. As a reviewer I strip this down into the below:1) Quality - Built to last. Fun isn&rsquo;t fun if it ends prematurely. I believe in the quality of this copter and have witnessed it through a series of tests.2) Functionality - Yea this is mentioned above but in term of fun the copter has to perform in a way that people can pick up and enjoy. The &ldquo;slow&rdquo; setting allows for beginners to pick up and play while fast mode allows more experienced users the ability to let this thing loose. A well thought out and fun to use copter.3) Service - Food tastes worse with a bad server, hotels are less enticing with unprofessional staff and toys can be ruined if the manufacturer doesn&rsquo;t hear you. USA Toyz puts a big emphasis on customer service. I&rsquo;ve spoken with them multiple times and have faith that they will be responsive for you.SummaryA great sub $100 copter with tons of features. The videos and pictures look great and in the end it has been a pleasure to review.Please feel free to ask questions below, i&rsquo;d be happy to answer them.Thank you for reading!</p>

<p> I got this USA Toyz quadcopter as a gift and it is great! I am more of an advanced flyer and like to sport fly more than anything. The UDI U818A is not a sport flyer though, but it IS a great entry level camera quad. The big protective ring doesn&rsquo;t do it any favors in sport flying but it does make it extremely stable for getting good video.The yaw on low is very slow and on high is still not as fast as like, but for taking video this is a good thing. A faster yaw would make the video hard to watch, the slower yaws help keep it steady and watchable.This quad is super stable and take really great video for a toy quad. It is easy to fly and would make an excellent quad to learn to fly on and take awesome videos. It has 2 speed rates and in low it is perfect for beginners, while in high gives it enough power to maneuver through some wind. The protective ring will make it get pushed around in the wind, but it can push through it in high. I find that moving it upwind and letting it drift downwind makes for some really steady shots.It has an awesome function where the transmitter will start beeping when the quad has low battery. This is great because if you&rsquo;re really high in the air you won&rsquo;t be able to see the warning lights on the quad. With this feature you will be able to safely get it back to you in plenty of time before the battery runs out.It has headless mode and RTH and they both work fairly well for a toy quad. Without GPS they are not always reliable, but they do work pretty good.Overall I really like this quad a lot. I would highly recommend it to beginners and intermediates who want to learn how to fly and film before they get a high dollar camera quad. It is a very nice to fly and would be very easy to learn with.The video I posted is some footage from the quad when I took it to the beach. The video might not look as good on Amazon as it does on my computer due to the restrictions Amazon has on file size.For my full detailed review and unedited flight footage please follow the link below. If you want much more information and more videos on this quad check out my YouTube channel.

<blockquote>
<p>For under $100, this thing is great. This is my first quad copter and this one is easy to control, takes decent video and still pics. I&rsquo;ve included a pic from about 200ft up. Pretty durable too. I&rsquo;ve crashed landed this into trees, onto concrete and bounced it off walls, It&rsquo;s a very forgiving design. I didn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars for a couple reasons. The first is that if there is anything more than a gentle breeze, the wind catches it pretty easily. The second reason is that the power bank that came with it is pretty weak. It only charged the two batteries one time. I tried charging my cell phone with it and it only gave my phone a 10% charge. But, that part was free. Do yourself a favor and order a couple extra batteries. Flight time is only about 5-7 Minutes before it starts beeping at you as a warning of a low battery.Overall, great value and good fun for a beginner!</p>
