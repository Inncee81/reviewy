<ul>
<li>Yep, this is a big bag of screws (well, and spacers). Why would someone buy a big bag of screws and spacers? It&rsquo;s better than a sack of nuts (especially for those with a peanut allergy).</li>
<li>But seriously, no TV screw hole size is the same when mounting a TV. And nothing is more disappointing than buying a TV and mount and realizing you can&rsquo;t throw it on the wall since you don&rsquo;t have the proper screw length.</li>
<li>Here is what ECHOGEAR promises. This TV pack will ensure you won&rsquo;t be screwed when it comes to mounting your TV.</li>
<li>How can we make that promise? We provide M4, M5, M6, and M8 TV Screws and Spacers for mounting virtually ALL TV&rsquo;s up to 80&rdquo;.</li>

<li><p>Even more, M8 Screw Length hardware guarantees compatibility with Samsung TVs in the market today, which tend to have compatibility issues.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A compact box w/ nicely packaged collection of mounting screws and spacers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="had-what-i-needed">Had what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a LED Samsung 65 inch. I just moved and the movers lost all my hardware for mounting the TV. This was very annoying, because as anyone that is looking to buy this product knows finding the right screw is a pain in the rear. This set comes with 2 of everything. It is way overkill, but for $15, you get every screw you could ever need. My Samsung I now found out takes M8s at 20mm for my mount. All mounts can be different. With that said, avoiding all the trips to the hardware store, .25-.55 cents per a screw attempt&hellip; $15 is reasonable and you have extras. It is a fair price for what you get, if you don&rsquo;t know exactly what you need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="could-not-have-mounted-the-samsung-tv-to-the-universal-bracket-without-this-kit">Could not have mounted the Samsung TV to the universal bracket without this Kit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had purchased a 55 inch Samsung 4K UHD TV for the family room. I had a universal mounting bracket kit but the M8 screws were not long enough. Then I read that I needed M8&rsquo;s that were 40 to 45 mm long and knew I needed help. When I found this kit it was a blessing. I used 2 of the 45 mm&rsquo;s and 2 of the 50 mm&rsquo;s for the bottom screws that were recessed. Also the back of the flat tv is curved and spacers are needed. This kit came with the long spacers I needed on the top and my old kit had two shorter spacers for the bottom. Perfect fit!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-hardware">Great hardware</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I replaced a wall-mounted TV with a newer one. The mounting screw holes in the new TV were larger than the screw holes in the old TV. I had no idea where the original full set of mounting screws had gone and I didn&rsquo;t want to replace a perfectly fine wall mount for a new one, so I looked online and found this set of mounting screws. I had them shipped via two-day air. They are high quality screws of all (TV mounting) sizes and lengths that connect your TVs to an existing TV mount. I am very pleased.</p>

<h5 id="every-screw-washer-spacer-were-included-in-this-package">Every Screw, Washer, Spacer Were Included In This Package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Every screw, washer, spacer were included in this package.. Certain Samsung TV&rsquo;s are a little tricky when it comes to finding the right screws for their brand of TV&rsquo;s&hellip;I was in that same dilemma of not finding the right screws from my previous TV mount kit&hellip;Some, Samsung TV&rsquo;s are a little more trickier to mount than other TV&rsquo;s, because the mounting holes on the back of the TV are different sizes&hellip; The screws to fit the top mounting holes are smaller than the screws to fit the bottom mounting holes.. In which they are larger.This kit fit all of my mounting needs, I had a long list of washers/screws included in this package..I&rsquo;ll definitely buy from seller again..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed-for-an-lg-oled65e6p">Exactly what I needed for an LG OLED65E6P</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The m6 screws worked perfectly for my LG OLED TV. Screws that came with a universal mount I got had the wrong thread pitch, and I could not find the correct ones at the big box or even specialty hardware stores in my area. The 35mm screws and spacers worked perfectly to offset the mount from the back of the TV (the speaker base projects out slightly from the rear of this TV). I also have plenty of spares for projects requiring metric screws in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-fits">IT FITS!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s bags of multiple sized machine screws, washers, and spacers. It had the right size for my TV (and I had bought FOUR!! different sets from different companies that claimed to fit my TV that didn&rsquo;t). I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with the leftovers, but I&rsquo;ll add them to my quickly grown machine screw set. I especially liked that each size was separated and sealed off from the others-and each section is labeled with the size of the screw.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-really-a-fantastic-set-we-moved-into-a-new-house-that">This is really a fantastic set. We moved into a new house that &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is really a fantastic set. We moved into a new house that had the wall mount already up but no bolts. The manual for my TV didn&rsquo;t list bolt sizes and after several trips to the hardware store I still hadn&rsquo;t found the right size. This set is complete. I expect you could find the right bolts, washers and spacers to mount any TV. It&rsquo;s well worth the price to avoid frustration and save a lot of time. It&rsquo;s not only finding the right diameter that can be difficult, you also need the right length and maybe a spacer. Because of this, I wouldn&rsquo;t go with any set that doesn&rsquo;t have all the common diameters and lengths unless you&rsquo;re sure you know what you need. In my case, I needed an 8mm by 40mm and the 30mm and 35mm and larger bolts wouldn&rsquo;t have worked. If I&rsquo;d gotten a set that didn&rsquo;t have the 8mm by 40mm, I would have been out of luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="funny-old-thing">Funny old thing&hellip;&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A multitude of nuts, bolts and washers that attach tv&rsquo;s or similar to wall mounts, it&rsquo;s funny because that exactly what it says they do in the product description.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-lot-of-screws">A lot of screws.</h5>
