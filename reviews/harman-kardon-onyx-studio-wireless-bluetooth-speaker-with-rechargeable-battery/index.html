<h5 id="excellent-bluetooth-speaker">Excellent Bluetooth Speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An excellent Bluetooth speaker system with very, very good sound that&rsquo;s full of bass with well rounded mids and highs. It looks gorgeous just sitting there and blends well with most decor without looking pedestrian like all of the competing rectangular bricks on the market. Harman went out of their way to distinguish this speaker&rsquo;s looks so I&rsquo;m not going to ding it for &ldquo;not being portable enough.&rdquo; Here are a few pros and cons:Pros-Price. Well worth $199-Sound is AWESOME-Rubberized housing-Built in battery for portability-Looks gorgeousCons-No Line-in input. Seriously an oversight but mitigated that almost everything has Bluetooth today&hellip;except my still working iPod-Fabric front cover will likely pique easily. I like it but wish the fabric was less scratchy/catchy.-Battery is only rated at about 4hrsLast comment&hellip;there is a clear plastic cap/cover over the metal speaker (rear passive radiator) on the back. The cover must be removed for proper speaker operation. An image of it being removed was in the enclosed operating instructions but I missed it and only discovered the plastic cover after reading a professional review on another website.** UPDATE 9/8/2014 <strong>I bought a Bose Mini to compliment my Harman Onyx Studio. I love how well it&rsquo;s made, plus it has line-in input. The sound is very, very good and it&rsquo;s super portable BUT it does not sound nearly as good as the Harman&hellip;I remain a HUGE fan of the Harman!</strong> UPDATE 7/27/2014 **I spent an hour at Best Buy recently looking at all of the Bluetooth speakers there and came away even more impressed with the Harman Onyx Studio. Why? Because you can completely control the speaker&rsquo;s volume from your cellphone! Press the unit&rsquo;s volume buttons either up or down and watch your cellphone do the same in real time. And vice versa&hellip;slide your cellphone&rsquo;s volume up or down and Onyx Studio complies immediately. This is so much more convenient than having to walk up to the speaker and control the volume by pressing the buttons directly.The Bose Soundlink Mini, by contrast, won&rsquo;t sync and respond to volume changes directly from your cellphone. Bose&rsquo;s suggestion, keep the Mini turned all the way up (full blast) then control the volume down using your cellphone. Super silly suggestion and an easy fix, Bose, with a firmware update. More annoyingly, this should not even be the case as the Bluetooth standard(s) have been out for years. In 2013 (when the Mini came to market) why oh why would Bose not have included direct sync for remote volume on their cool little product? Get this, in 2014 Bose introduced their larger Soundlink III and it too does not have volume sync. Absolutely ridiculous. The Big Jambox at least received a firmware update in 2013 to sync volume among other improvements such as AAC.Bose does not include AAC or aptX support, but that&rsquo;s fine with me because these small speaker systems really don&rsquo;t have the resolution necessary for these codecs&hellip;but the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity is lost by not having volume sync. Bose could have really saved some money per unit and skipped Bluetooth altogether by only providing a line-in input. :)Best Buy gave me a chance to listen and rate the following products:Best Sound1. Harman Onyx Studio. Why? It&rsquo;s a big speaker with several drivers and dual passive radiators. This is old fashioned engineering inasmuch as big speakers make big sound and that requires a lot of power to move air. It&rsquo;s no wonder the Onyx Studio is only rated at about 4-5 hours of battery life.2. Bose Soundlink III. Sounds awesome, is slightly smaller with a more convenient shape, and is better constructed as compared to the Onyx Studio; however, it costs about $100 more and lacks volume sync.3. I think it&rsquo;s about a tie between the Big Jambox and Soundlink Mini sound wise. The Big Jambox is a win based on firmware updates, LiveAudio DSP, and overall louder volume with sync. <em>If you read this review Jawbone, the overall sound of your Big Jambox is a bit too bright/harsh&hellip;a neat future firmware update would be to offer two or three &ldquo;sound profiles,&rdquo; such as standard, warmer, cooler, etc.</em> The Soundlink Mini is a win based on OUTSTANDING aluminum construction, portability, and great sound from such a tiny speaker.Sony&rsquo;s SRS-X5 and SRS-X7 are awesome (I actually preferred the smaller X5) but for the money, I&rsquo;d go with the above based on slightly better bass.IMO, the Beats, JBLs, Logitechs, just don&rsquo;t come close.</p>

<h5 id="rechargable-battery-last-less-than-6-months">&ldquo;Rechargable&rdquo; battery last less than 6 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this speaker 6 months. Plugged in, it sounds great. However, our battery no longer charges. It makes a bloop sound and immediately turns off. So we cannot go wireless at all. I contacted the seller and was told that since it was more than 30 days after sale, I could not exchange for one that works. This was an expensive speaker, I expected it to last more than 6 months! To top it off, we only start using the speaker a couple months ago when the weather got nice. Very, very disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cool-then-worthless">Cool&hellip;Then worthless.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product worked for about 6 months. It now can&rsquo;t produce any sound other than overstated bass tones. I have tried reconnecting and used multiple different devices with the same result.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really">Really</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought one and its only been a week and it won&rsquo;t stay on&hellip;..won&rsquo;t hold a charge or even stay charged</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this on March 9, 2016. Use it probably 5 days a week. All of a sudden it lost all of it&rsquo;s tone, just a deep bass. Tried a different iPad with the same result. It&rsquo;s junk now. Probably no warranty.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="speaker-works-abd-it-will-cut-off-watch-the-video">Speaker works abd it will cut off. Watch the video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I purchased this in May, which is last month. The sound is clear, the speaker is simple to use, the base is bumping, and you can hear the sound upstairs when you&rsquo;re downstairs. the bluetooth range is good. THIS SPEAKER WILL CUT OFF ON YOU. In the middle of the song, it will automatically turn off, even after charged. I got it all on tape for you&hellip; Please watch the video. So much information&hellip;It turned off when i was recording.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-little-speaker-with-great-bass-and-connectivity">Awesome little speaker with great bass and connectivity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is by far the best portable bluetooth speaker I laid my hands on. I tried various ones from various brands. None fills a decent size room like the Onyx Studio. I am shocked how good (not comparing to $1000+ hi-fi systems) the sound and the bass is despite limited size.Connects with bluetooth devices painlessly (tried with my Iphone 6+ and Surface Pro 3, took only seconds to establish connection).It is not very small, but highly portable. Do not think that this is something you can stuff in your backpack. You can, but it&rsquo;d be pretty much take all the space. To give you an idea, it is as big as a mid size cooking pot.I bought this for under $100 in used from a reputable Amazon seller and boy am I happy.To summarize:+ Amazing sound for its size+ Surprisingly strong bass+ Easily connects with any device I have+ Nice, simple look- The legs are bit awkward, one of mine broke when I was pressing the on/off button- Buttons are a bit hard to operate</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impressed">Impressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wish I could give this product five stars. However, I do find it frustrating that it doesn&rsquo;t last very long off the wall outlet. I&rsquo;ve only had it go for maybe an hour and a half and then it dies and you have to hook it back up to power. As far as sound quality it&rsquo;s the bomb! If you like Bass this is a great speaker for you! I would definitely recommend it if you just want it for around the house so you can keep it plugged to the wall, if you want it for outdoor recreational use, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought as a gift for my girlfriend- The sound from this thing is incredible- way better than the Bose&hellip; no wonder BMW &amp; Mercedes are using HK systems</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-if-not-best-value-on-market-under-100">Great, if not best value on market under $100</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exceeds audio quality and function for the price (90$). Not a flat, true audiophile sound projection, but what are you expecting for this fantastic price?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has a great sound quality and connects quickly to all of my blue tooth devices. I love being able to take this speaker from room to room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price-point-wish-i-had-spent-a-little-more">Good for the price point, wish I had spent a little more.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the sound, but the battery doesn&rsquo;t stay charged longed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound is good, but cheap plastic legs are useless and have both broken off. No misuse. Very unhappy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-life-sucks-1-to-2-hours-out-the-box">Battery life sucks, 1 to 2 hours out the box.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound, horrible battery life. If you want this for a patio with an outlet nearby this is perfect, if want this for beach/park you&rsquo;ll be sending it back like I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needs more base</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-charge">Doesn&rsquo;t Charge!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looks and sounds great but don&rsquo;t get it unless you plan on leaving it plugged in all the time. I&rsquo;ve left it plugged in to charge both turned on and off over night.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love It!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hands down the best Bluetooth speaker at this price point that I&rsquo;ve come across. The bass on this thing is awesome. Definitely happy with my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-amazed-at-this-speaker">I am amazed at this speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am amazed at this speaker. I decided to go with the studio one because did not need the built in mic and higher price tag with the three.</p>
