<h5 id="works-great-for-me">Works great for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in an apartment complex in a forested geographical depression and get lousy cell coverage (TV broadcast signal too) as do the rest of the tenants who live here. I used to get 2 - 3 bars with an occasional 4th bar in my apartment. My cell phone is also my only phone so good cell reception is very important to me.Unlike the other cell signal booster I tried which needed 25ft of separation from the transmitter and receiver, this device only needs 6ft of separation. something I can actually do reasonably in my small apartment.Once I installed the WeBoost and let my cell phone (a Samsung Galaxy S4) adjust to the device I get mostly 4 bars in my living room where it is installed. Reception was as low as -120dBm but now it is as high as -104dBm.I should (SHOULD but other stuff happens too) no longer have any dropped calls due to bad reception .I am giving this device 4 stars (4.5 really) instead 5 of because of the price &amp; lack of wall mounting for the booster.</p>

<h5 id="the-device-gets-4-stars-wilson-electronics-gets-0-stars-for-blowing-me-off">The device gets 4 Stars, Wilson Electronics gets 0 Stars for blowing me off&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this device. When it&rsquo;s set up properly, the enhancement to the quality of service (QoS) is pretty stellar. My negative feelings are that the device is extremely sensitive to direction and that the seller would not send a &ldquo;free&rdquo; patch antenna when asked.To be fair, I&rsquo;m in a fringe area for both ATTWS and VZW, the latter is a native USCC region but line-of-sight to the nearest VZW antenna (I know where the ATTWS and USCC and VZW antennas are; I&rsquo;m supposedly &ldquo;roaming&rdquo; on USCC since I&rsquo;m in a different state (WA) but the VZW antenna is in OR, across the Columbia River on microwave backhaul so my iPhone &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; it&rsquo;s 20 miles away in Astoria OR&hellip;). My ATTWS iPhone connects to the antenna near the Bradley Wayside Park in OR, with little issue. This booster helps with both networks, with a caveat.The Booster is very sensitive to direction. Only because I know exactly where the tower with the installed antenna array is (I worked on the installation teams years ago), I can align the Booster antenna in the relevant direction. &ldquo;Tweaking&rdquo; the antenna can result in much better QoS, or kill service completely - a couple of degrees in rotation can provide solid LTE service or No Service.I&rsquo;d like to try an external antenna with this unit, however, a call to the company led to my being told &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This, IMO, is to me a frustration in that I am in a fringe area, with pretty good external service that isn&rsquo;t great inside, but the company did offer a free/no-cost external antenna as an option (I&rsquo;m surmising the antenna is offered to enhance the device&rsquo;s capabilities, but I&rsquo;m likely not going to find out as I&rsquo;ve been denied this option and the manual/web site do not specify which external antenna options exist.4 Stars on my experience with this device and some time invested to make this device work, 0 Stars for poor customer support. The eqo costs &ldquo;only&rdquo; $350, I&rsquo;m surmising that because I&rsquo;m not spending more on their other products I&rsquo;ve been blown off. I like the eqo, just be prepared to be left to your own devices to make this work.</p>

<h5 id="did-what-it-advertised">Did what it advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start out stating that I was very skeptical about this purchase. I live 10 miles from the nearest tower. I get 1 bar of AT&amp;T LTE (-114db) at 2 windows in my house. I received the weBoost EQO with big hopes but low expectations. I set the device up in about 10 minutes. Powered it on and immediately had LTE signal throughout my room and the next room. I didn&rsquo;t get any signal in either before unless u pointed your phone at the north star and stood on 1 leg in certain areas. As for the signal gain, at the antenna, I&rsquo;m getting roughly -85 to -90db LTE signal in a room that didn&rsquo;t have any signal before. 3 feet away from the antenna the signal dropped to around -108db, 8 feet -113db, 14 feet -114db. This was all in the same room. Going out of the room(through two walls), I still had a LTE signal throughout my kitchen, and living room(second window with service is in here) at -118 db. Going further into my house it drops LTE and i get 4g and spotty LTE(much better than before installing the weBoost). I can freely walk around and talk on the phone or stream high definition video. Service outside of my house is worse than the service inside my house. The 4g is good enough to stream video on.I&rsquo;m not sure what didn&rsquo;t work for the others on here but it made me very skeptical. I am truly amazed at my signal now as it is my only internet and phone. Before, I would have to open a window and put my phone in the window and use it as a hotspot. I can talk on LTE and hotspot at the same time now. I did research as I eagerly waited for it to come in and looked for the towers around my location and figured out which direction to orientate it. While my service isn&rsquo;t 5 bars, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it. I also wasn&rsquo;t expecting the range I get off of it and the quality of the signal throughout the house. I honestly thought I would be returning it out of frustration.4 stars because of the width of the signal receiver and the lack of mounting capabilities on it. In my case, the receiver HAS to sit on the window seal that is 5 foot off of the floor so I have nothing to put it on other than the window seal. That would be fine but it doesn&rsquo;t balance well with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> of the device hanging off of the seal. On the plus side, there is a SMA port on the side of the receiver for an external antenna. Update: Contacted weBoost and they worked with me to find a great solution increasing my signal even more and giving me more flexibility of where I could put my systemVery pleased with the product so far. Can&rsquo;t say anything about longevity other than 2 year warranty.attached are before and after data test. This was conducted at the window without the booster and at the antenna with the booster on. Better one was obviously with the booster on.Update: After installing an outdoor antenna I now get -80db at the antenna and around -100 at about 15&rsquo; away. After that it drops off drastically but keeps LTE throughout the house maxing out at -118 at the furthest part of the house.</p>
