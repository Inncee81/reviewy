<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-sound-quality">Excellent Sound quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Sound quality, Superior Value and battery life and somehow it&rsquo;s waterproof and small. Get&rsquo;s quite loud too and has good enough bass quality for a speaker of this size, sure it doesn&rsquo;t shake a ton but it is noticeable and good for an efficient and small little speaker like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="long-playing-loud-and-perfect">Long Playing, Loud, and Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you listen to this speaker outside, around in your home, or inside the shower (which was my primary reason for getting this, do what you will with that~~yeah), the sound coming through is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Clear, crisp, loud, consistent sound is perhaps the barometer by which we all judge speakers, and while I cannot say much more expensive sound is better, saying &ldquo;For the money&rdquo; would not do this justice: it would be an insult. I&rsquo;ve had this speaker for a couple days now and used multiple songs with different beats to determine my satisfaction.I have tested it and the Amazon page says the Bluetooth reach is up to 33 feet. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with losing signal, and I have a tendency to walk away from the speaker with my phone in my hand and I haven&rsquo;t lost signal through multiple walls. It also has a great battery life. In my tests so far, it has easily lasted 9 hours and doesn&rsquo;t take long to recharge when it does need to be plugged in. On that note, it comes with all the cords you need including a micro USB for charging. I highly recommend this&hellip;mostly because it seems fairly indestructible and and did I mention it&rsquo;s LOUD?! Undeniable and easy buy!</p>

<h5 id="a-great-speaker-but-slightly-over-priced-at-the-50-price-point">A great speaker, but slightly over-priced at the $50 price point.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Please note that I was provided this product for free in exchange for a review/evaluation.Bottom line on this one, folks - at the current listed price just shy of $50 this speaker is over-priced. At $35-40 it&rsquo;d be 5-stars.I have reviewed a good number of bluetooth speakers and there are a variety of speakers in the $30-35 range that perform just as well as this one with the same features.At the time of this review there are 5 other reviews, all with 5 stars. I suspect that these individuals have not reviewed many other speakers, and as such they&rsquo;re enamored with this speaker because it is indeed a great performing speaker&hellip;..either that or they just want more free stuff from China.All of that being said, as noted it does perform great. Awesome sound even at max volume driven by two 5W speakers. Pairing is a cinch (but I haven&rsquo;t seen a bluetooth speaker that&rsquo;s hard to pair&hellip;listing this as a feature seems a bit silly).I like that the port cover for the aux connection and micro USB port is nice and snug (and a bit of a hassle if you don&rsquo;t have fingernails like me).Construction seems solid and durable with some pads on the corners to absorb some impact if you should happen to drop it.Thanks for reading/watching folks, I hope you found this information helpful.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-nice-purchase">Pretty nice purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just purchased but so far so good. Sounds clear and loud. Pretty awesome so far.. will write in a couple of months if I change my mind. Its been a couple of months now and the sound is fantastic I am really enjoying my purchase every day at work.</p>

<h5 id="great-bass-very-powerful-and-sturdy-my-favorite-bluetooth-speaker">Great bass, very powerful and sturdy - my favorite bluetooth speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I received this set of bluetooth speakers, I put it through my usual testing protocol.First, I checked the bluetooth connection. The speakers paired effortlessly with my Ipad, iPhone and Mac. It also had no issue maintaining the connection when I walked from the living room to the opposite end of the apartment in the bathroom.One thing I noticed is that the Vomach speakers don’t have a voice saying “power on”, “connected”, etc. Instead they just make a chime. Personally I don’t mind, in fact I actually prefer the chime vs voice, since the voices are often weird and super Chinese.In terms of construction quality, the Vomach looks and feels very good. I know this ultimately doesn’t mean much, since I’ve had products that felt cheap and were instead excellent, and others that felt good but were of very poor quality. So, even if it’s not too relevant, these speakers definitely get a thumbs up for how they feel.I put the Vomach against what were my favorite speakers (the Geega) and went on to test it with a variety of music, from high pitched vocals and piano, to dance and heavy metal.The Vomach speakers performed flawlessly in every situation, not only that, but they obviously outperformed the Geega thanks to deeper bass, and an overall richer and more room-filling sound.The Vomach speakers also happen to be splash resistant. Which means, you can’t submerge them in water, but if you want to use them in the shower or outdoor (where rain or swimming pool splashes can occur) you don’t have to worry about them getting destroyed. The buttons are sealed and the mini USB charging outlet is protected by a rubber tab that provides a good seal. Personally, I would rather use a cheaper speaker set if I’m in the shower or outdoor, simply because in these situation you don’t really need the best sound quality you can get, and I would rather not have to find the limits of what my $50 set can withstand. But that’s just me. It’s good to know that if something involving water were to happen, the Vomach should be fine.The Vomach also comes with a rummer loop and carabiner, so it gives you more options in term of where to put it.Now, the price. I noticed some other reviewers subtracted 1 star because they believed the price was too high. As I mentioned before in my other reviews, the star rating should reflect how good the product is, not how good of a bargain it is. So, for me this is a 5 star product. You are paying for the quality you are getting. The Vomach is more powerful than the Geega, in spite of both being rated at 10W, which means that the Geega is probably overrated.UPDATE 08/14/16: Since the writing of this review, I tested the Vomach against two more speakers, and while they were very good, the Vomach is still my favorite! Additionally, I noticed that they lowered the price from around $50 to $33! So, if at $50 I believed that you were getting a good value for your money, at $33 this speaker is an absolute bargain, as it outperforms every other speaker I tested in the same price range.If you have any questions, let me know, I’m happy to help! And if you found this review helpful please consider saying so below. The positive or negative feedback helps me produce better reviews!</p>

<h5 id="awesome-purchase">Awesome purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this Bluetooth Speaker! This item has very quickly become my &lsquo;go to&rsquo; speaker recently. Item arrived VERY well packed and has amazing clarity when using for music or phone calls. I have even used this item when taking a bath and it is such a relief to not have to worry if this falls into the bathtub!! The only con I have found is that it does pick up a lot of background noise when using for phone calls. However, this does happen with any of the Bluetooth speakers or headphones I have used in the past. Overall, a very great item!</p>
