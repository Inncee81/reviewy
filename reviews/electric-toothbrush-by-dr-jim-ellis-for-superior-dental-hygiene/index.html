Manual VS Electric Toothbrushes , Whats the Difference?</p>

<p>Is there any difference in how you brush your teeth with an electric toothbrush vs a manual one? Yes, there is. A manual toothbrush must be pulled, and then pushed, back and forth across the teeth. An electric toothbrush can do all of the cleaning in just one pass. Simply place the brush against the teeth and slowly pull it along the tooth surface. The vibrating head will move, up to, 40,000 strokes per minute as it passes by each tooth. Thus cleaning much more effectively then several passes of a manual brush.
How To Properly Brush Your Teeth</p>

<p>Divide your mouth into four quadrants. Dividing your mouth into top, left, right, and bottom quadrants to tackle your brushing routine. This can help ensure that you brush each section of your teeth and mouth cavity.</p>

<p>You can start with whichever quadrant you like or is most comfortable to you and you should spend about 40 seconds on each quadrant while brushing every single surface of your teeth.
Place toothbrush bristles along gum line. Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gum line. Keep the bristles in contact with your tooth surface and gum line, which can help ensure you get the most effective brush possible.</p>

<p>Apply only gentle pressure, as too much can injure your teeth and gums. The vibrations of your electronic toothbrush can also add a little additional pressure.
Floss between your teeth with Jim Ellis DDS Floss Piks! Even with thorough brushing, dentists recommend flossing your teeth twice a day. This can help remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth that brushing couldn’t reach.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="better-than-my-sonicare">Better than my Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this! My husband and I had Sonicare but my husbands kept breaking. So he took over mine and I ordered this! It looks great, but works even better. I never felt like the Sonicare did a good job cleaning. I can tell this one is doing it&rsquo;s job. I also love that the power button is separate from the mode button and you don&rsquo;t have to push the button multiple times to get what you want. The quadrant timer is clear so you know when to switch. And you definitely can&rsquo;t beat the price! As my kids get older I will definitely be purchasing more!Also customer service has been fantastic. I got an email to make sure it arrived and that everything was there and in working order. And it was. It arrived quickly and looked great.</p>

<h5 id="it-comes-with-3-brush-heads-but-i-ended-up-purchasing-the-additional-twin-pack-to-get-the-free-shipping-so-they-pretty-much-paid">It comes with 3 brush heads but I ended up purchasing the additional twin pack to get the free shipping so they pretty much paid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product for my wife who swears by her Oral-B but was willing to give this one a try since I picked it up. She wasn&rsquo;t so sure the brush pattern would work for her vs. the circular pattern of her Oral-B but she was pleasantly surprised. The Jim Ellis consistently does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do and is a little easier on her gums. She was concerned about the brush size since she has a little smaller mouth than most but, once again, no issues. I haven&rsquo;t personally tried it but she almost has me convinced to give it a try. It comes with 3 brush heads but I ended up purchasing the additional twin pack to get the free shipping so they pretty much paid for themselves. This is after two weeks of use.</p>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is our first electric tooth brush, It came with 3 brushes, which one brush would not go on the shaft. The company had emailed us to see how we liked the brush, I reported the problem and within a week we received 2 more brush heads. So if you want customer service buy this brush they stand behind their product. Now for how it works. We are very satisfied, my teeth feel very clean. It does everything as advertised. I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-my-previous-electric-toothbrush-was-a-pursonic">So far so good!! My previous electric toothbrush was a pursonic &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good!! My previous electric toothbrush was a pursonic which the on/off button finally failed/broke. Saw this unit on amazon with good reviews so I purchased it. I like it better than the pursonic for two reasons.The pursonic had 1 button for on/off and vibrating options. A lot of work for one button. This Ellis unit has 2 buttons, one for on/off and the other for vibration options which I like a whole lot better.The brush heads are a little bigger than the pursonic which I like better.</p>

<h5 id="great-electric-tooth-brush">Great electric tooth brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice item. Works well. Need to get my mouth accustomed to the tickling feeling on my gums. As long as it lasts for a reasonable length of tine,, I will be most pleased. Fair price. Good looking product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-love-them-thus-far">We love them thus far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought 2 of these brushes for my wife and I. We love them thus far. I like that the neck of the brush is long enough and narrow enough to brush the back of your back teeth without a struggle. Great brush for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-but-timer-is-an-issue">Decent, but timer is an issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first electric toothbrush I&rsquo;ve encountered that doesn&rsquo;t have a spinning head. It merely vibrates and doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s doing as much as a spinning head. I&rsquo;m no dentist, I don&rsquo;t know if it doing enough, but I hope so. It&rsquo;s more gentle than most electrics when it&rsquo;s on Clean mode, which is a nice change. Rather than feel like a jackhammer is against your teeth, it feels like a bee is against it. Whiten mode feels horribly uncomfortable though.This toothbrush has a timer on it that shuts off when it decides you&rsquo;ve been brushing for too long. This may be wonderful for some people, but not for those with hand tremors. Tremors make it very hard to get the brush into the mouth and keep it there the whole time, which means brushing can take far more time than the brush allows. It&rsquo;s irritating to have to always turn it back on in the middle. I&rsquo;d rather not have my brush parent me, and I&rsquo;d like a way to override this feature.One good thing is that it holds a charge for weeks. It&rsquo;s nice not having to worry about recharging often.All in all it&rsquo;s a good toothbrush. Not amazing and not bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="liked-mine-so-much-i-rapidly-purchased-a-second-one">liked mine so much I rapidly purchased a second one &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>liked mine so much I rapidly purchased a second one for my wife who delights in it after a day or two of use.. This feels better than the half-dozen electric toothbrushes we have tried over the years.. The speed is swift, but not too intense. The controls are easy to understand, and the power button is different from the mode button, and the mode choices are intuitively straightforward. Hardly a key issue, but the design of the handle is simple, clean and straightforward.Giving this five stars, based on performance and quality. That noted, am not all that excited about the two posts for additional brush heads&hellip;. changing the heads out for two different users is possible, but would grow tiresome over time.. easier to have two separate handles and a slightly smaller charger base. The other issue is a bit frustrating&hellip; there is no &ldquo;tailored to fit&rdquo; travel case&hellip; so packing this will demand some specific care. That said, those are hardly primary issues in what this brush is supposed to do&hellip;.</p>

<p>I bought this based upon the rave reviews by other buyers. I have used a Sonicare for many years and needed to replace it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-the-different-setting-options-for-brushing">I like the different setting options for brushing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the different setting options for brushing. the charge holds for several days before it needs a recharge, and the two included replacement heads and stand are a nice touch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works like the expense models. I found no difference in the cleaning and whitening modes. The brush lasts a long time too.</p>

<h5 id="improved-brushing">Improved brushing</h5>

<p>I bought this for my grandson who was not brushing as long as he should and consequently have cavities, maybe he will need a root camel!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed with this toothbrush. I&rsquo;ve been using an inexpensive Oral B electric toothbrush (which is far better than a regular toothbrush) for many years.</p>
