<h5 id="my-favorite-bike-gadget-why-use-any-other-co2-inflator">My favorite bike gadget!! Why use any other CO2 inflator?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this device! It&rsquo;s easy to operate, great-looking, light and, compared to the inflators that completely enclose the cartridge, extremely small. Place the cover on the cartridge, firmly screw on the inflator, place the inflator on the valve and press! No switches to operate, no twist-to-inflate. Just press to inflate.In early 2012 I stopped to help a rider whose tire had flatted. She said she didn&rsquo;t need my inflator as she had one (also by Genuine Innovations). It was a type that had a valve switch on it. But before attaching the cartridge she had guessed wrong on the proper switch position and all of the CO2 gas vented into the atmosphere. I lent her my Air Chuck Elite to use on her second cartridge and after using it she was totally sold!Some operating tips:&ndash;Keep it on the valve for 6 seconds to fully empty the cartridge contents. Don&rsquo;t be timid, jam it on there!&ndash;The inflation pressures claimed by Genuine Innovations appear to be wild exaggerations. In warm weather, a 16g cartridge might get a 700x23 tire up to 90psi, depending upon how much tube volume the rim profile permits. In cold weather, perhaps only 75-80psi. Depending upon rider weight that could be sufficient for the front wheel and enough to prevent pinch flats on the rear wheel. In below-freezing weather&hellip;it&rsquo;s best to also bring a pump. Note that SRAM only advertises a 100psi inflation result for 700x23 tires for its (larger) 20g cartridges, which I believe is more realistic.&ndash;When inflating, positively keep your hand off of the &ldquo;black dot&rdquo; at the back of the chuck head. If you apply any force to this dot then you&rsquo;ll be fighting yourself, simultaneously applying force to both the chuck head and the cartridge port (only the latter should be pushed). In other words, place your hand on the cartridge and the conical portion of the chuck head only.UPDATE:&ndash;For road cyclists, for air temperatures below 45°F, I recommend packing the 20g cartridges available from SRAM and Genuine Innovations. They&rsquo;re pricey. I swap out the 16g cartridges 20g cartridges in the fall and then re-swap in the spring. I know one road cyclist who packs the 20g size year-round.&ndash;I don&rsquo;t often get flats, but I have noticed that I tend to use this device twice to assist other riders with their flats for each time I use it on my own bike. Such is the burden of carrying a CO2 inflator&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="be-warned-product-issue-can-leave-you-stranded">Be Warned - Product Issue Can Leave You Stranded</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product a few weeks ago. As a number of other reviewers have reported, upon use a red o-ring seal shot out of the unit, making it impossible to get a good seal between this unit and my valve. Luckily I was only a few miles from home and, by using both of my CO2 cartridges, was able to get enough CO2 into my tire to limp home. This would have been really ugly if I had been 20-30 miles from home as is often the case. I wonder what my calves would feel like after walking 6 hours in cleats.There are many positive reviews about this product in addition to those that have reported this issue, so it appears that it can work well when it works, but has some sort of design or quality defect that makes it prone to failure. Potential purchasers will have to decide if they can tolerate this risk.I contacted the company almost two weeks ago requesting assistance and have not heard anything back at all. Since I can&rsquo;t continue to ride without a working inflator, I will have to buy a different one at my own expense. I guess they don&rsquo;t care to respond and don&rsquo;t stand behind their products - how disappointing.</p>

<h5 id="stopped-working-after-second-use">STOPPED WORKING AFTER SECOND USE!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>STOPPED WORKING AFTER SECOND USE!!!! I just received it and wanted to test it. First time I tried it the unit worked ok. Then I went to test it again and it made a loud popping noise &hellip;AND didn&rsquo;t work. I read all the positive reviews and did read the few negative ones. I thought maybe someone was misusing it and it broke. BUT &hellip;I worked as a professional master auto mechanic for over 18 years and worked at tire outlets too! I am as experienced as you get with filling tires with compressed air &hellip;THIS PRODUCT IS SIMPLY POORLY DESIGNED!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-recommend-putting-the-nozzle-on-the-valve-before-screwing-in">I recommend putting the nozzle on the valve before screwing in &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing works very well. I bought it on the recommendation of a blog that did testing. I recommend putting the nozzle on the valve before screwing in the cartridge, because I struggled to get a good seal the first time and wasted a cartridge. You may need to push the back of the stem to get a good seal. Anyway, after that it was very easy to inflate and I got about 105-110 psi out of a 16g cartridge on a 700x25 tube. I&rsquo;m very satisfied!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t leave home without this device on my bike. If I switch bikes, I put it on the other one.It&rsquo;s simple, easy to use, small, not a big weight difference. If there is a weight issue it will be with the cartridges.I would buy this again if I didn&rsquo;t have it. You MUST have a way to get home if you bike a lot, or far. Figure that out, this is a great solution.I use this device, 2 cartridges, a tire tube and 2 tire levers, I wrap these items up and rubber band them together in 1 tight mass.Then this goes in the bag on the bike I&rsquo;m using. Great setup.</p>

<h5 id="where-have-you-been-all-my-life">Where have you been all my life?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is awesome. I live in thornville so I am constantly getting leaks even with thorn resistant tires, green slime and puncture shields. Had a low tire last night. Whipped this guy out, screwed it on the 16g cartridge and inflated my tire. I was on my way in five minutes. I have presta valves. This is much better than carrying a hand pump around.Update: Just bought another one for my other bike. You can get cheap threaded 16g cartridges here on Amazon as well. See my other reviews. I haven&rsquo;t tried this on a Schrader valve yet but works awesome on a presta valve for sure. Makes a nice tight seal. I stopped carrying a pump because these work so well. Fills mountain bike tires and XC tires just fine. You can top off a tire several times with one cartridge. These are so much easier and quicker than a pump.</p>
