<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="beware-these-seem-to-be-counterfeit">Beware- these seem to be counterfeit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These heads were of much lower quality than the original head that came with my Sonicare toothbrush. The bristles began to bend and lose color almost immediately, whereas my original Sonicare head lasted for months (they are supposed to last for three months). The &ldquo;Philips Sonicare&rdquo; printing on the heads was also faint and blurry and these brushes really seemed like a counterfeit product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-replacement-brushes">Good replacement brushes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good replacement brushes for the e Series Philips Sonicare. They come in factory original packaging and the price - for six brushes - is good, better than I can get at local stores. We have four in the family using these brushes, so getting them by six is not a problem. Overall we are big fans of the Sonicare and have been using them for years after recommendation by our dentist. Weak point of the system are the rechargeable handles. We have had several replaced over the years (some under warranty after only a few months of use). I recently found a seller on Amazon (Genuine Sonicare Parts) who sells the handles as replacement parts, a good and cheaper solution if you do not need a new charger and/or brush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-phony-about-these-brushes">Nothing Phony about These Brushes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, my brushes arrived this week, mid September 2016. Guess what? Like the set I ordered a few years back, they are REAL Philips Sonicare brushes in REAL factory sealed packaging. And, just for the fun of it, I screwed one into the head. No extra noise, no extra vibration. There is something REALLY weird to me about all those earlier comments that made claims about these heads not being the real thing, not to mention being defective. I&rsquo;ve learned over the years to disregard such babble. I&rsquo;ve concluded that it comes from other vendors trying to discourage customers from patronizing their competition.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wear-out-way-too-quickly-1-month">Wear out way too quickly ~ 1 month</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Each brush is advertised to last at least 3 month. In my experience they last about a month before becoming soft and loosing color ( an indication of replacement time). I bought a 6-pack in October and have used of all 6 brushes in less then 9 months! The replacement heads I used to buy at Target or other retailer ( usually a 2-pack or a 3-pack) used to maintain its firmness and color for at least 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-fit-and-dishwasher-safe">Perfect fit and dishwasher safe</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the standard replacement heads for the older Sonicare toothbrushes and the e-series (the ones they sell at Costco and most major grocery stores). They are dishwasher safe (I wash ours once a month) and last about 3-4 months with daily use. They come in a pack of six: two light gray, two light blue/aqua, and two dark gray so you can color code the family&rsquo;s toothbrushes. They have blue bristles. When the blue disappears, it&rsquo;s time to replace your toothbrush head. Sonicare is meant to work through sonic vibration. You press the brush edges against your tooth and gumline and it cleans by holding it there. It beeps after two minutes which is how long you&rsquo;re supposed to brush your teeth. Sonicare also makes a line of toothpastes including one with extra fluoride that is only available through your dentist (they cost about $12). None of the other &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; toothbrushes work nearly as well as Sonicare and they haven&rsquo;t raised their prices in several years. This makes it much easier for kids to brush their teeth and be effective when getting the space between their teeth and behind their front teeth which is where most plaque starts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fake">Fake</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should have paid more attention to all the one star reviews. This product is not what you think you are getting. First off the picture listed for the toothbrushes is deceiving. The order comes in two packages of three. Kudos to whoever made these knock off sonicare heads as the packaging appears to be legit. Unfortunately, after opening one of the packs, you can immediately see that it is an inferior product. Plastic is very cheap and bristles are very soft, not hard as the real ones are. I&rsquo;d be surprised if all six of these toothbrush heads last 6 weeks. I should have just bought the real thing from Costco (which costs the same amount as these). As you can see in pictures, the toothbrush head doesn&rsquo;t say e series as the real ones do. Emailing Amazon and hopefully I can get my money back</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loved-the-toothbrush">Loved the toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have not found a replacment head that seamed to hold up as long as the first head that came with the toothbrush. My teeth do not feel as clean as they used too. I feel that the manufacturing materials used as of late, are not of the same quality as when I origional purchaced this toothbrush. Loved the toothbrush, but something that has changed in the last couple of replacment sets I have purchaced. I will be switching to another brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="name-brand-is-definitely-worth-the-extra-money">Name brand is definitely worth the extra money&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a couple of these toothbrushes for my husband and last Black Friday. After wearing out the first toothbrush heads that came with it I bought generic replacements. I did not notice a huge difference at first but found myself not as impressed as I was initially. I finally decided to buy the real thing this time and let me tell you&hellip;.what a difference. The second I put it to use I could feel a huge difference. My teeth feel and appear cleaner. My whole mouth feels better. I notice the difference even when I look in the mirror hours later. My teeth look fabulous! The generic heads developed an odor quickly too, (usually within a week or 2 despite cleaning them with natural cleaners, and I promise we are not gross people!). These toothbrushes are inconvenient in the fact that the heads do allow water, etc. inside the toothbrush, (even with the name brand heads). If you don&rsquo;t remove the head after every use you will get a fungus growing in it. It really freaked me out the first time I discovered this. I looked because it started to smell and I noticed my ears were very itchy. It was truly horrifying to see what I had been putting in my mouth. This is not an issue if you remove the head and clean it out after each use. I do wish these were not so expensive but it is worth every penny to get these instead of the generic.</p>
