<h5 id="best-on-the-market">Best on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only dash cam with the option of changing the DVR video view. Best on the market &amp; the only model with these options. I can change the recording view from up, down, front, back or side to side. I have it mounted at the top of my windshield on the drivers side. It&rsquo;s out or the way and not as visible to people from the outside- it blends in with the windshield pillar very well&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll send pictures of it later. I have 4 dash cams and this is my favorite 1 by far. I&rsquo;m even getting another 1 for my other vehicle and I have 3 friends that want me to get them 1 because I showed them mine and they love it. I would say this is a VERY GOOD PURCHASE AND WORTH THE MONEY&hellip;..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="everything-i-wanted">Everything I wanted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I research these dumb things until I was cross-eyed. It just seems like the dash cams are all pretty much the same now with the same features. For me, it was just a matter of which unit would fit my windshield the best. I finally pulled the trigger and got this one mainly because I like the shape and the simple interface. I have to say, after using it for about a week, I&rsquo;m blown away. I really like the larger field of vision it gives you and the #1 winning feature is for sure the ability to move the camera up and down and left and right. Strangely enough, I have found myself actually driving more attentively now that I have it in my car. It&rsquo;s almost like having someone watching you, documenting your driving and that&rsquo;s OK with me.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-hq-video">very good HQ video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to image quality and voice recording the RangeTour does very well, very good HQ video.It does not do so well at night.The most troubling problem and it is a design flaw, it is taking out or replacing the memory card, it is so difficult to do, to the point that you might break the card, it come with a little blue stick to remove, but if you don&rsquo;t get it right the memory card will shoot out of the opening and now you have to go under the seats of your car looking for this very tiny card, truly a design flaw. I bought a cable extender to resolve this (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/LANMU-Extension-Extender-MicroSDHC-Raspberry/dp/B01D9J8KQE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493826334&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tf+memory+card++extender+cable">https://www.amazon.com/LANMU-Extension-Extender-MicroSDHC-Raspberry/dp/B01D9J8KQE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493826334&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tf+memory+card++extender+cable</a>), but it does not work well.The second thing is overheating, once the temperatures go over 60 degrees, it will shutdown after a minute or so, it will not stay on.If Carpanion has a solution, I will be willing to give it a try.If the 2 things get resolved, you can definitely say this is one of the best one out there for this kind of money.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-good-with-a-design-feature-you-will-appreciate">Pretty good with a design feature you will appreciate.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I&rsquo;ve been testing and reviewing quite a number of Dash Cams over the last 2 years and watched how they have all evolved. They started with the 720p&rsquo;s as the highest rated ones back then and now, they go all the way up to 4K. Even some of the 1080p&rsquo;s were not that great if the processor is junk. I recommend looking for Ambarellas or Novateks.I thought this was a very interesting design as you can rotate the camera underneath. I wasn&rsquo;t thrilled about the FHD 1080p as I&rsquo;ve been spoiled with 2.7Ks. The product itself is very light and plasticy so I wasn&rsquo;t sure on the build and performance due to the initial feel. I do have metal cases and those seem to fall off the windshield or get so hot to the touch so the weight isn&rsquo;t a big bother. I do appreciate the accessories it came with, which included the tiny tools to help you tuck the cables into the windshield crevices and dash, but even included cable clips if you are unable to wedge them in. Extra points for including a 16GB card!The user interface is easy enough if you are used to it. The tricky part was the time setting as the &ldquo;select&rdquo; button is not actually how to move from month-day-year&hellip;I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m liking the fact there isn&rsquo;t a suction cup mount as this will be an install you can&rsquo;t move to different cars. What this means is that you will have to install this permanently to your car windshield. It does come with an extra 3M tape if you even need to move it.Picture is very clear even during this gloomy weather when I was filming. I was disappointed with some other 1080p&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ve tried but this one is pretty decent. Not perfect but pretty good. Must be the Novatek chip at work.Reasons I didn&rsquo;t give this a perfect score:• Can&rsquo;t be easily moved from car to car. Would&rsquo;ve appreciated a suction cup so the SD card is easier to access.• It comes with the cigarette lighter plug and not just a regular USB. Most cars now have the USB so that is better.• Not micro USB but mini USB• It is difficult to remove the microSD card. You have to use the pry tool or need long nails (small fingers) to pop it in and out.The camera design is nice as you can mount behind your mirror (so it is not so much in the way) and still have the camera hanging low enough that you can easily rotate.I recommend and it will definitely not break the bank. Compared to the others around the same price point, this has very good quality pics/videos and also great for taking road trip selfies easily by rotating the camera. My daughters loves taking selfies.Please excuse the video uploaded (or my dirty windshield) as the quality is lowered when uploading to Amazon.</p>
