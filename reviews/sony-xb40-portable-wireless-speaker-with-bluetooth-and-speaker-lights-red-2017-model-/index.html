<h5 id="great-value-when-it-s-on-sale-two-paired-together-is-worth-it">Great value when it&rsquo;s on sale - two paired together is worth it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:- Great stereo separation when using two- lights can be kind of gimmicky but still fun sometimesCons:- speakers limit volume when battery is less than half full (when not plugged in) - both are limited if even one battery is getting low.- speaker sometimes cut-out during play.- phone app to control sound and lights is slow</p>

<h5 id="big-bass-without-treble">Big bass without treble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who think the JBL Charge 3 sounds muffled, this one even tops it. With its default setting which means Xbass active the sound is very boomy and covered with hardly any treble. At least there is some app offering a 3-band EQ which lets you adjust bass, mids and treble, but even with treble dialed up completely it is lacking any real sparkle. For low levels with Xbass turned on you have to decrease bass completely to make it a compelling sound, without Xbass on the other hand it tends to sound pretty anemic, while still quite muffled overall. The Bass reaches down to about 55Hz which is quite a bit deeper than on a JBL Xtreme, but a Fugoo XL reaches even deeper. Overall volume is adequate and there is no sign of distortion even at maximum as the DSP takes care of compressing dynamics at high levels with the result that any real punch is lost quite a bit. A real party mood is not possible with it, as bass gets dialed back quite a bit at high levels, although it can be brought back again with some EQ adjustment from within the app. But I always caught myself fumbling around with the sliders all the time, depending on which level I listened to. At low levels bass reduction and mids increase is helpful to make the sound more bearable, while at high levels boosting bass and reducing mids helps as well. The sound is never quite right, which is a bit annoying.I won&rsquo;t comment on the lights as they always seem to be behind a bar, they never quite manage to synchronise to the music and the whole effect looks rather like some random flashing and blinking.Battery life seems ok, with Xbass and lights active I was able to achieve 5:25h at maximum volume until the speaker reduced volume nearly completely and continued to play for some other hour at a really low volume.Overall this speaker would have had some real potential with either a more careful tuning or by adding some tweeters. It sounds a bit cumbersome to tell the truth, which is a pity. Maybe great for the HipHop or Techno generation who doesn&rsquo;t really seem to care about real audio quality!</p>

<p>Amazing sound</p>

<h5 id="sony-xb40-delivers-great-sound-outdoors-and-charges-my-cellphone">Sony XB40 delivers great sound outdoors and charges my cellphone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The Sony XB40 has many technological improvements that make this portable Bluetooth speaker system superior to other products in this crowded marketplace. We have been using Bluetooth speakers for several years while working out on our Louisiana forestland. The hot and humid environmental conditions put any speaker system to the test but since we are outdoors we may also drop the devices too! As a result, surviving a few weeks in our forestry crew is a true test!The first thing you will notice about the Sony XB40 is the amount of sound it can produce in such a small size. Outside in an unconfined area that has no walls or houses, the Sony XB40 can truly reproduce my favorite music without a flaw. We generally run the speaker a few notches off its maximum because it tends to shake and rattle too much!Operating the Sony is simple and it is very responsive to button pressing. For example, turn on the speaker with a Bluetooth paired phone playing music nearby and it will blast out your song in about 3 seconds. I noticed the Sony XB40 was is also much smaller in size compared to the G-Project G-Boom speaker we have been using outdoors. The compact design saves room in my backsack for other outdoors equipment.We use a LG C900 cellphone to store and play music via Bluetooth. The phone has about a 10 hour battery life and will run out if we camp overnight. The integrated charge port on the Sony-XB40 wireless speaker solves this problem instantly.Battery life of stereo Bluetooth speaker with LG C900 phone charging is approximately 20 hours 12 minutes. We gathered this from 3 different full charge and recharge cycles on the this product. We played the music about 75% power every time.Finally and most important, the multiple flashing lights on the Sony-XB40 are my favorite feature! They are pleasing to watch from a distance and seem to give me an extra boost while working out in the forest.In conclusion, amongst our crew of outdoor adventurers the Sony XB40 portable Bluetooth speaker is the best such system we have ever seen or used. We want two of these so we can blast out our favorite songs in all directions while enjoying our day in the forests of Louisiana!</p>
