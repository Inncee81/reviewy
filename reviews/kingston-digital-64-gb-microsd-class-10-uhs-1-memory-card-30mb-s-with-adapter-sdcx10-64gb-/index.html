<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-card-with-decent-speed">Good card with decent speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an updated review - I initially reported that these cards were slow, but I failed to do proper testing and simply showed my stupidity - I am sorry to anyone I misled. I have now done real testing using the H2testw 1.4 utility and can report actual facts!The other reviewers who stated these cards are way slower than Class 10 are NOT correct based on my tests. I took a chance anyway because I trusted Kingston and liked the price - looks like that was a good decision. While I was initially worried about the read speed, based solely on a subjective assessment of scanning thousands of .jpg files on the cards, detailed testing has shown that this problem was related to the specific files (size and numbers). To definitively answer the speed question I have used the H2testw 1.4 utility to compare these cards directly with my Samsung 16GB cards with the same class 10/UHS-I rating. (In the interest of time so I could correct this review quickly after I found how wrong I was in my first review, I have initially only tested with 1GB of data for each card; however, I am now running the full 16GB tests and will update this review again if it finds anything significantly different.)Results from H2testw:Kingston 16GB Micro SDHC class 10/UHS-I - write speed 11.1MB/sec, read speed 19.2MB/secSamsung 16GB Micro SDHC class 10/UHS-I - write speed 12.3MB/sec, read speed 19.3MB/secAs you can see, while technically the Samsung card shows a tiny edge, they are virtually identical in both read and write speed. While the read speed is way short of the stated 30MB/s, since both brands of cards show the same 19MB/s result, I am not prepared to denigrate the Kingston card for that - perhaps it is a limitation of the card reader on my system? On top of that, I think the Kingston tech support response to my original bone-headed review speaks volumes about the quality of this vendor. I think you SHOULD buy this card!</p>

<h5 id="very-short-life">Very short life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The SSD card worked as expected&hellip; for one month almost to the day, and then it went into read-only mode and stayed there.I have researched and Googled ways to unlock the card all to no avail. I can no longer write to it.I have tried formatting it on a PC, on a Nook, in a camera and in a smart phone, but none of the devices can write to the card.The only saving grace is that I can still read from the card, so I was able to rescue the pictures and documents I had on the card. I was only ever able to use about 45Gb on it, so I never even filled it up before it died.As such, I can only give this card a one-star rating and I cannot recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work-as-advertised-but-ultimately-functions">Doesn&rsquo;t Work As Advertised, But Ultimately Functions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for the sole purpose of using it with my 3DS to upgrade the stock 4GB card that comes in every DS system.It&rsquo;s a Micro SD card with an adapter and it works. Well&hellip; The Micro SD card did at least. The adapter was DOA and not detected by my computer hence the 4* rating. Fortunately, I had several SD adapters laying around to troubleshoot so I came to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s not worth the hassle of returning to Amazon or submitting some form of a RMA to Kingston. I dusted off a trusty Sandisk SD adapter that I&rsquo;ve had for many many years. Lo and behold all 14GB was detected by my computer. In summary:Pros:- it works- lifetime warranty (this is pretty much a standard for all forms of cheap flash memory like flash drives or SD cards)Cons:- dead adapter- lower speeds than advertised (30MB/s in title but description does state 10MB/s minimum)Would I buy it again? Eh, most likely. It works and I&rsquo;m getting semi-decent write speeds averaging about 16-18MB/s. If this was priced a lot higher I&rsquo;d be far more disappointed but flash memory is so cheap and is essentially a commodity nowadays compared to times past. However, I can say that if a competing product (company starts with an S, ends in k) is similarly priced next time around I&rsquo;ll probably buy that as their flash memory is impeccable in my experience.</p>

<h5 id="a-steal-of-a-deal-for-a-quality-card">A steal of a deal for a quality card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly as described, I received my 32 gig micro SD card without any problems. It arrived in its retail packaging (unlike another card I purchased earlier this week which overheated my tablet) and had the correct amount of available space. I&rsquo;ve owned various branded cards in the past but keep coming back to Kingston, none of my other smaller sized cards from the company have ever failed or ever deleted files. Be weary of the &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo; priced micro SD cards sold here and other online places, especially ones sold in &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; or &ldquo;frustration free&rdquo; packaging, the companies won&rsquo;t honor their exchange policies&hellip;too many fake cards being sold as legitimate ones!UPDATE June 13th - Mine is still going strong without any issues and I purchased another one for my son&rsquo;s tablet as well.</p>

<h5 id="this-kingston-micro-sd-card-works-wonderfully-just-what-i-needed-for-my-mp3-player-detailed-review-follows">This Kingston Micro SD card works wonderfully! Just what I needed for my MP3 Player,,,Detailed review follows</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For me, I find Kingston SD Micro Memory Cards very dependable. I purchased this to use in my combo Bluetooth Speaker/MP3 Player. This player has a slot for an SD card (micro) up to 32GB. However, I purchased this size because I wanted to place about 10 or 12 MP3 albums of music and so I copied this. The 8GB was plenty of room for this, in fact, I still have 4 MB leftover if I want to add more songs.The card received my music in a timely manner. I did not time as I walked away and then returned about 20 minutes later and my songs were on the SD card.I tested this by reading the SD card inside the adapter. It read fine there and also read very well in a micro SD Card reader.The music is now playing beautifully from this card, I simply turn on my Bluetooth speaker (on my Kitchen Table) and listen to outstanding music while eating a meal.Five stars I give to this card and adapter!Highly recommend it to all.</p>
