<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-works-perfectly">It works perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product arrived well packaged and it&rsquo;s very easy to put on if you follow the steps. I have installed many screen protectors for my mom. This one is very professional looking and it fits the screen without any bubbles. My mom said that It feels like a original glass. It&rsquo;s exactly what her was looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-second-one-installed-just-fine-and-as-with-all-other-wet-application-screen">The second one installed just fine, and as with all other wet application screen &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR:First things first - this is a wet application kit. If you are not familiar with how to install wet application screen protectors, then you might want to watch a few videos on Youtube or stick to dry application screen protectors.Secondly - You may have guessed that this is not a tempered glass screen protector by now.Third and probably most important - This is not case-friendly screen protector. If you have a phone case on your Samsung Galaxy S8, you&rsquo;ll want to look for the right screen protector. This screen protector covers the entire HUGE screen.Fourth: This screen protector did not work with my Ringke or Spigen cases.And then onto the actual review of the screen protector itself:You are purchasing this Pleson, two pack, wet application screen protector for your Samsung Galaxy S8. Upon opening the package, you are greeted with a ton of information on how to locate the instructions on how to install this properly. If you have ever applied a Zagg&rsquo;s, Invisible Shield, IQ Shield or Skinomi screen protectors, then you will be able to install this Pleson screen protector the same way.If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this is Pleson&rsquo;s first wet application screen protector available on the market. I applied the first screen protector and realized there were creases in the my copy of the print. As a result, I had to discard that one and apply the second one. The second one installed just fine, and as with all other wet application screen protectors, you do need to let it cure for 12-24 hours for the edges to dry and fully seal. After the screen protector dried, I noticed a few imperfections on the screen protector itself. However, Pleson does have a lifetime warranty as per the ad.Edit: I also want to thank Emma from Pleson as she reached out to offer me a refund, but I politely declined. I worked with her in hope that the company understands that &ldquo;full coverage&rdquo; is the exact opposite of &ldquo;case friendly&rdquo;. She had also sent me a replacement to try again, but I could not get the corners to fit with my cases. The is definitely a company that likes to work through all options so that no one wastes their money. As a result, it&rsquo;s pretty hard not giving them a five star review.My instructions for install:1. Fully clean your screen with a wet wipe that is safe for glasses or computer screens (do not use included package. It has alcohol and will strip your Oleophobic coating), then make sure it is completely dry. Then, use a different cloth to remove any dust or residues.2. Use the spray included in the box to completely cover your phone screen.3. Use the spray on your fingers that you plan to use when you install the screen protector. If you run out, make more of the fluid by mixing <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> water with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> dish detergent.4. Pull the white sheet off the screen protector and lay that onto your phone screen. Adjust if needed by keeping the screen wet. As long as the screen&rsquo;s wet, the phone will not adhere to the screen protector.5. After aligning, use a squeegee (included in package) or a credit card to squeeze all the water and bubbles out of the main section.6. Use a clean, dry towel (make sure it doesn&rsquo;t have lint) and dry as much as you can.7. Use your palms to hold down on both curved edges of the phone until it adheres.8. Squeeze and dry water as you&rsquo;re holding the edges.9. Finish with a hair dryer on low heat to completely close the seals.</p>

<h5 id="great-screen-protector-scratch-resistant">Great screen protector. Scratch resistant!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this screen protector pack for my new phone Galaxy S8. I was worried about scratching my screen. It has everything you need to install it and it will protect my screen from scratches. Fits on the edges just fine. Edge apps are still easy to get to. Take a bit of patience to put it on right. Be sure to wait the full 12 hours before using it with a case.I was very pleased with this protector, and is confident my screen will be protected.</p>

<h5 id="have-been-needing-one-of-these-for-so-long">Have been needing one of these for so long! &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have been needing one of these for so long!! Works perfectly, fits right onto my galaxy. I&rsquo;m really hard on my phone so I have to keep it in a hard protected case <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, but the problem is- it doesn&rsquo;t have a front screen protector. This one I was able to stick right on with my cover, so now my entire phone is protected. Exactly as described. A++</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-protector">Great Protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ah, this protector is great. I have a toddler at home who loves my phone and it has been dropped once with a minor crack in the screen. I had to get something to protect it from cracking more in case this happened again and this screen protector is great. I don&rsquo;t worry when she has the phone in her hand for fear she will drop the phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-updated">Not bad <strong>Updated</strong></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I would highly recommend watching the video on how to apply this product. Its easy to follow and gives tips so you can apply the protector with ease.Secondly, I waited for the protector to dry for about 13 hours, it looked seamless. During the 13 hours, I checked on it and smoothed down the edges to make sure they stuck.After the 13 hours, I put on my case. It some what peeled one of the corners but I was able to smooth it out. I&rsquo;m on day 2 and I still have to smooth edges down, it&rsquo;s minor lifting. The picture included is when I smooth it out and it first begins to lift again.Overall, this protector does &ldquo;work&rdquo; with the case and it does cover the whole screen. I did have a glass protector before this one and it popped off as soon as I added the case. So I&rsquo;m hoping this one will stop lifting soon.Other things to add are:1. The display is still super clear and the sensitivity isn&rsquo;t hindered2. It does attract smudges, even just washed hands.3. No bubbles!Update:Today my screen cracked! This did not save it at all. The fall wasn&rsquo;t even bad.Update:After the last update, the company contacted me and provided a refund. They have excellent customer service.</p>

<h5 id="this-actually-is-a-good-looking-screen-protector">This actually is a good looking screen protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This actually is a good looking screen protector. 1st one got some dust, 2nd one went on perfectly. Looked like nothing was there and it felt good for this type of screen protector. Reason I took a star off is cause this protector will not work with many cases. Its just a little too big so when you slide your case around the back it pushes up the screen protector and causes bubbling. Good screen protector if you&rsquo;re not using a case</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-recommended">Not recommended..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not recommending this. Frustrating to install. It was hard to separate the back plastic from the cover itself, I thought at first there was only one thick cover, because I couldn&rsquo;t separate them. Same thing happened for both protectors. Ended up, with few dust particles on my screen protector because I had to re-install them a few times until I just got frustrated and left it as it is.</p>

<h5 id="its-okay">Its okay</h5>

<p>The product works well until I put it in the case. I watched the video as instructed. I waited 24 hours before putting the case on and the screen protector started coming up from&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="looks-perfect">Looks perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The instructions were good and helped making sure the screen protector was perfect. I never ran into any peeling on the edges like others reported. Fits nicely even using a case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-recommend">Do not recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I followed the instructions and watched the video. These were way more trouble then they were worth! I put one on my husband&rsquo;s phone and one on my phone.</p>
