<p>Big Zoom Deliver Outstanding Versatility</p>

<p>30x Optical Zoom (25–750mm)
With the PowerShot SX710 HS camera in hand, you&rsquo;ll be impressed at the zooming capabilities of this slim, compact digital camera. The amazing 30x Optical Zoom gets you just where you want to be: down on the field, high atop a skyscraper, deep into a landscape and much more. The camera&rsquo;s advanced technology helps ensure that images and videos are captured in outstanding quality, with Intelligent IS that chooses the stabilization method that&rsquo;s best for the shooting conditions, so images are virtually shake-free in a wide variety of situations.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Connect and Share With a Touch</p>

<p>Built-in NFC (Near Field Communication)

<p>Clear Viewing, Easy Shooting
3.0-inch High Resolution (922,000 dots) LCD
The large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of 922,000 dots makes even the smallest details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle, so showing others what you&rsquo;ve captured is easy, too.</p>

<p>Super Zooming Now Easier Than Ever
Improved Zoom Framing Assist
The camera&rsquo;s Zoom Framing Assist function offers a variety of support for capturing excellent long telephoto shots. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button returns the lens to its original zoom position, keeping the subject in focus until you&rsquo;re ready to shoot. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position. Zoom Framing Assist also offers a seek assist function that detects when you&rsquo;re panning (for instance, to search for the ball on a field) and automatically zooms out to help; stop panning, and the zoom returns to its original position. Zoom Framing Assist keeps even a moving subject&rsquo;s face the same size in the frame with a tap to the Zoom Framing Assist function button; the feature is especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. The system lets you choose the subject&rsquo;s size: choices include face, upper body, whole body, manual or off, and now AUTO. In AUTO, the camera evaluates camera movement, distance to subject, and the number of faces to automatically zoom in and out to stay focused on subjects and shoot them at the optimal size, even automatically zooming in to find faces when they are too small. Also new, an Auto Zoom feature that makes it easy for others (at a tourist spot, for example) and even children to take a great picture of you: the camera automatically zooms to frame the shot to just the right size. Conveniently, all Zoom Framing Assist functions are also available when shooting video.</p>

<p>Rethink Photography with Creative Shot
Creative Shot mode
PowerShot digital cameras with Creative Shot mode help turn your images into impressive artistic photos! Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options.

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking to replace my Kodak Z950 travel zoom after nearly 5 years of service, and was very pleased with the performance of my now 2-year-old Canon SX40 HS super-zoom, so I was going to look at Canon first. I was considering the SX700 HS, but late last year, the Canon website noted the coming update to the SX710 HS, so I waited. I ordered directly from Canon and have had it a couple of weeks now (about 2 weeks ahead of Amazon).The main change from the SX700 to the 710 is the increase in resolution from 16 MP to 20 MP. The other features are basically the same, including a 30x optical zoom (fairly high for this range of camera), Canon&rsquo;s DIGIC 6 processor, and wireless connectivity including NFC to tap-transfer pictures to a compatible cell phone. The SX710&rsquo;s body is also the same as the SX700, with a pop-up flash and a small easy-to-hold form.If you&rsquo;re familiar with Canon cameras, the mode wheel and controls will be what you&rsquo;re used to - if you&rsquo;re new to the brand, they&rsquo;re straightforward and very easy to use. I usually leave my camera in M (manual) mode and select the exposure, shutter, ISO, and white balance myself. I&rsquo;m by no means a pro, but that level of control allows me to get the best picture quality in virtually any situation, including very low light without flash. And unlike my old Kodak, the Canon screen - a very sharp 922K 3-inch LCD - adjusts with the settings you choose to show a much more accurate representation of what you&rsquo;ll shoot <em>before</em> you take the picture. The Kodak&rsquo;s screen was basically one setting and I often had to retake shots after seeing how they came out. The mode dial is a little on the stiff side compared to my SX40, so I did have to get used to that, but unless you frequently change from one mode to the other, that really shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.In actual use, the SX710 shines. Again, it&rsquo;s a travel zoom, so if you&rsquo;re going on a photo-intensive trip, bird watching, or some similar activity and want &ldquo;awesome/incredible&rdquo; pictures, then use a super-zoom or DSLR. Just to compare for myself, I took the exact same picture with both the SX40 and SX710, with the same image settings - the 40&rsquo;s photo was sharper and had better focus on tiny details, and I expected that from the better lens of the super-zoom. But for &ldquo;very good&rdquo; pictures, the SX710 is far superior to the old Kodak, and is just shy of the SX40 for the pictures I generally take (parties, general scenery, fixed targets, etc.). The range of shutter speeds, exposures, and ISO settings allow you to get a great picture whether in full Auto, full Manual, or anywhere in between. The aperture is fine for this type of camera, ranging from f/3.2 to 6.9, although again, it won&rsquo;t match the abilities of a super-zoom or DSLR.Both the image and video quality are what you&rsquo;d expect from Canon. Images print clearly on photo paper and look good shared online in all the resolution ranges (although it&rsquo;s always recommended to shoot in the higher MP ranges if the pictures are intended for hardcopy printing). The video shoots up to a very clear 60 fps in full HD (1920x1080p) and allows standard zoom during shooting for very nice movies. You also get clear stereo sound.Besides the stiff mode wheel, the only drawbacks I&rsquo;ve encountered are a less-than-quick battery/card door (you need a very dry/tacky finger to open it quickly), and the flash snaps to its position with an audible &ldquo;twang&rdquo; of the spring which has me just a little concerned about long-term durability. All minor issues, though - and nothing that really takes away from using the camera.Since the SX710 is just an update of the 700, the full range of accessories are already available, including AC adapters, 12V car chargers, higher-output batteries (I like the Vivitar NB-6L / NB-6LH Ultra High Capacity 1700mAH Li-ion Replacement Batteries for Select Canon Digital Cameras, Pack of 2 for this line), and other equipment. I also went with the Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Case for Camera - Black as I have had good experience with Case Logic bags for other equipment, and while it&rsquo;s a very snug fit for the camera body, it works pretty well. Canon warranty is their standard 1 year on the camera body and 90 days on the OEM battery. (The Vivitar batteries come with a 5 year warranty, which is why I like to use those.)For a travel zoom, the SX710 HS is a terrific camera. Features, settings, and capabilities are first-rate, and all in a very tidy package that can fit in your pocket. While this brings my run of Kodak cameras to a close after nearly 30 years of 35mm, APS, and digital products, I&rsquo;m much happier with the Canon equipment I have now, and look forward to years of excellent service from the SX710 HS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am an avid amateur photographer that travels a lot (love travel photography!), and I carry both my professional camera and a smaller camera with me wherever I am going. I have used various professional and &ldquo;point-and-shoot&rdquo; cameras over the years for the quick and easy shots, or for utilizing as a backup camera to have along with me whenever I do not want to carry my larger, more bulky (and a lot more expensive!) camera around. I have never been disappointed with any Canon camera I have owned in the past, and this one is no disappointment for me, either. I have owned 3 Canon Powershot cameras over the years and this one is amazing and by far the best. It is very easy to use, and has simple and easy to adjust controls (no fumbling). It has been very easy and reliable to use for just about everything so far, from travel photos to zoom images, simple portrait images, and even occasional macro shots. The auto shoot modes are very reliable for most shots and I have been impressed with the rapid focus and clarity of the images. I was surprised that I like the &ldquo;creative shot&rdquo; feature that gives you about 5 or 6 images of the same shot that are edited by the camera. Sometimes you can get some really great unexpected photos this way. The flash is very &ldquo;usable&rdquo; and will not fire unless the button is pushed to raise the flash. That is an improvement over some other cameras that I have used in the past that require you to stop and change your camera settings every single time you want to shoot an image in a darker or shaded spot without the flash. Also, the connectivity to my iPhone was very easy. I can look at all of the photos on the camera on my phone, pick and choose the ones I want to download to my phone (or to my computer) wirelessly, and also control the camera remotely using my iPhone. I was amazed with the functionality of this camera, ease of use, and the quality of the images. Another home run for Canon in the point and shoot camera world.</p>
