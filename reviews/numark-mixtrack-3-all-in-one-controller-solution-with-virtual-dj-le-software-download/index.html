<p>style:No RCA Output
From Numark—the world&rsquo;s leading innovator of DJ equipment and technologies—comes the incredible Mixtrack 3 DJ controller, designed with the professionally-aspiring DJ in mind.</p>

<p>This controller doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in soundcard, so it&rsquo;s made to connect to whatever external audio interface you plan to combine with it to route sound to speakers and headphones.</p>

<p>Dive into our 16 multi-function backlit performance pads and add loops, launch samples, and control hot cues to your performance. Use the multi-function touch strip for dynamic FX control and track search operation. There are dedicated filter knobs for each channel, to give you just the exact amount of tonal control you need for that perfect sound. If you can think it, Mixtrack 3 will do it.</p>

<p>With the included Virtual DJ LE software you can create professional-sounding mixes at home or easily upgrade to Virtual DJ Pro for performing live at parties, functions and clubs. Plus, Mixtrack 3 operates via standard MIDI to be compatible with virtually any popular DJ software.</p>

<p> 
Frequently Asked Questions
 </p>

<p>Do I need a driver for the Mixtrack 3?
The Mixtrack 3 is class compliant.  It uses device drivers that are already built into all Windows and Mac operating systems.  This means that there are no extra drivers for you to install.  This also means that the Mixtrack 3 will be compatible with the latest Mac and Windows operating systems the minute they come out - no driver updates needed!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Which DJ software is included with the Mixtrack 3?
The Numark Mixtrack 3 comes bundled with Virtual DJ 8 LE.  This software works seamlessly with the Mixtrack 3 and requires no mapping to use.</p>

<p>The Mixtrack 3 also comes bundled with the Prime Loops remix tool kit for adding loops and samples to live sets and TOOLROOM Artist Packs</p>

<p>To obtain your software downloads, first you will need to register your Mixtrack 3 in your account at Numark.com.  Once you register using your serial number you will have access to the download links and VDJ authorization code.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Can the Numark Mixtrack 3 be used with my iPad?
The Numark Mixtrack 3 is not officially supported as an iOS peripheral and is not being marketed as an iOS-compatible device.  It is intended to be used with the included Virtual DJ LE software on a supported operating system.  However, as it is a class-compliant MIDI device, it will work with nearly any device that accepts such information.  For example, to use it with an iOS device such as an iPad, an Apple camera connection kit and a powered USB hub would be necessary.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>What type of pitch sliders are used?
The Numark Mixtrack 3 has several pro features.  Class-exclusive 100mm pitch sliders make it simple to execute extremely fine pitch adjustments, so it’s easy to keep two cuts in beat sync without any drift. The conventional 60mm pitch sliders on competitive units can’t come close to matching the MIXTRACK 3’s performance in this critical area.  </p>

<p>A multi-function touch strip for dynamic FX control and Strip Search operation.  The touch strip allows for quick scrubbing of songs to set cues on the fly along with FX modulation.</p>

<p>Independent transport controls for greater operational flexibility, both utilizing metal—not plastic—controls for long-term durability. </p>

<p> 
I lost my software disk or authorization code for the included software.  What should I do?
Your Virtual DJ 8 LE code is located in your Numark.com account.  If you need to re-install the Virtiual DJ software, you can log in and get access to the download and authorization code.</p>

<p>Numark does have a process in place where customers can be provided replacement authorization codes and/or download links if they have lost their disk, or encounter difficulty authorizing the included software.</p>

<p>When circumstances allow, replacement authorization codes are issued to customers free of charge.  Basic customer information is required any time a replacement code is requested by an individual. This required information and further contact details can be found on the website below.</p>

<h5 id="great-controller">Great Controller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like a lot of people who buy this are idiots.I have read all of the bad reviews and it is almost funny how many people are complaining about things that are their own stupidity. This is a good controller with a lot of features for the money. Everything on it works well and it is made by a great company.READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY and you wont be another idiot giving a one star review.First off, It says plainly that it DOES NOT have a built in soundcard and that an audio interface is needed.If you dont read the description I dont think it is fair to leave a bad review. This is very easy to overcome without spending much money. I will explain and tell you what you need in sec.The other thing its getting bad reviews for is having to buy software.This is also idiots who dont know how to read and follow directions. This comes with a license for Virtual DJ LE. It Does NOT come with software. If you already downloaded a copy of the free home version of virtual dj and you plug in the controller,you are only going to get 10 minutes of use and you will get asked to buy a license. IF YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS and register your controller at Numark, you will get a license and download link for virtual dj le for FREE and FOREVER. You will also get free links to loops and samples and other cool stuff to mix with. Anyway,after you get your license, download virtual dj le and set up a sign in and register the software. You will now have free software forever that works and you will get a free trial of the pro software for 30 days. After that it goes back to the LE version.This controller has all of its functions with the LE version.You are really not loosing much but if you want all the features you can get a controller license for just this controller for 99 dollars for forever. ONCE AGAIN, it does not come with software or license key but you get it when you register the controller.NOW BACK TO THE SOUND CARD issue. I dont know how much plainer it could say no sound card or that it needs an external interface.Goes back to my theory of idiots buying things by looking at the pictures and not reading, But then it is not your fault when you dont get what you wanted.Look ,if you have read this far you dont have anything to worry about. You are reading reviews and researching before you buy so you are smart and you already know it doesnt have a built in sound card. Now all you have to do is use your computers sound card and add on a usb sound card. You can get a cheap usb soundcard with cd quality sound for less than 10 bucks.HERES HOW I DO IT. I have a desktop computer but this works on laptops too. Less than 20 bucks in parts and you can do what the mixtrack pro can do for 100 dollars less money. First thing is to go into your computers sound settings and change your setting to full size or full range or large speakers or whatever your option says. On windows,right click the speaker in the bottom right and chose playback devices then choose configure. you want to make sure you are getting full range output. Now you need a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch stereo to whatever your amp or powered speakers have for an input. I use <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch stereo plug to left and right male rca cables. You can order a good quality shielded cable from Amazon for less than ten bucks.Plug this into your computer line out or headphone jack if thats all you have and plug the other end into your amp or powered speakers. NEXT plug in the usb soundcard and plug your headphones into its green headphone jack. If you have a mic you can plug that into the computer mic input or the usb soundcard mic input but for either one you will probably need an <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch mono adapter. Now you need to go into virtual dj settings and set it to master + headphones and 2 soundcards. Tell it which is the master and what is the headphones and where the mic is plugged in and save the settings. Now you can play your main speakers with a track on one deck and cue a song on the other deck thru the headphones just like on the mixtrack 3 PRO. If you are doing this on a laptop, I dont know how good your internal sound card is so you might want to try it both ways and use the usb sound card for your main speakers.The usb soundcard I use is Sabrent USB External Stereo Sound Adapter for Windows and Mac and it is 6.99 here on amazon with free prime shipping. If you are getting really serious about the mixing and are a paid dj you can get the pro quality external sound interface from Numark for 99 bucks and have heavier duty pro quality parts that are just as good or better than the mixtrack 3 pro.They sell the interface here on amazon but i cant remember the model number.NOW I have told you everything you need to know to make an informed decision .This is a good controller.It will do more than any other in its price range and is higher quality. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to practice mixing or have some parties. If you dj for a living you shouldnt be looking in this price range anyway but with the right sound interface, you could get by just fine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m new to this DJ stuff. Long story short, I was a gigging musician (solo acoustic for the last 8 years), in July of 2015, I suffered a stroke and one of the effects was the loss of the ability to play my guitar which also meant no more gigs (and income). I was offered a house DJ gig at a popular local bar, which leads to this review. I needed something fast&hellip;cheap&hellip;and easy enough for a neophyte to figure out. Enter Numark Mixtrack III. The thing just works. I was able to figure it out and play music and Make Money, which was the #1 requirement. It&rsquo;s not fancy but the things that have to work, Faders, Knobs, Pitch sliders, and the Play, cue, and sync buttons, work like champ. The bonus is I&rsquo;m finding it offers a lot more via the VirtualDJ 8 software which I&rsquo;m still in the process of learning. Will I eventually outgrow it? Probably, but for a first controller to learn on, and earn on, it fits the bill.Do: get a usb audio interface (I use a behringer XENYX Q502USB) it doesn&rsquo;t have an internal sound card (you need the mixtrack III Pro for that)Do: Pay for the VDJ8 Pro softwareDo: get a good case/workstation for itDO: PAY FOR A MUSIC SERVICE or at the very least USE MUSIC THAT YOU HAVE PAYED FORusing pirated stuff screws the musician nuf saidI highly recommend this controller as a great beginner/neophyte piece, It delivers as advertised.Magma DJ Controller Workstation NV - Numark NV Road CaseBehringer Q502USB 5-Channel Mixer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ive owned this controller for about a month now, after doing a LOT of research and review reading , i decided on this controller , mainly because it has everything you would want in a starter controller, with added a few nice extras that you will simply not find in this price range elswhere (100mm pitch sliders and dedicated deck filter knobs)The touch strip is a nice addition, after getting used to it using it on traktor i like it way better than a parameter knob, reason being because you can tap directly into a position on the strip and take the effect percent or parameter directly to that value as oposed to &ldquo;turning to&rdquo; that value , wich you can slide to do too . also strip searching in songs is a nice time saver bonus you get out of them so cheers to numark on thatsecondly , price&hellip;as i said, i looked around and you wont get better set of features , from a recognized brand in the industry , for 150 bucks, the comparable one for this from a competing company would be the hercules universal dj system and its ususally a bit pricier (200) but it has internal soundcard but you dont get dedicated filter knobs nor 100mm pitch sliders on it , and i honestly like the mixtracks setup better (pads at bottom as oposed to top, one could accidentaly brush a platter just going for a pad , wich you will do a lot with looping etc. but its a personal pref thing i guess)IMPORTANT: this is the mixtrack 3 , not the mixtrack pro 3 , wich brings its own soundcard too, but its a 100 dollars extra (250)now&hellip;the reason i picked this version and not the pro?simple maththe ONLY difference between this one and the pro version is the included soundcard with output jacks for headphones and mix and a mic input, and color changes (cue/play buttons aluminum instead of black that sort of thing) &hellip;so you are paying a hundred dollars more for the internal soundcard &hellip;so if you take those 100 dollars you can buy a MUCH better external soundcard and can probably cover the shipping , and still come under the 250 for the pro version &hellip;so my advice is go for this option and get a good soundcard (heck get a 5.1 creative sound card with integrated mics and you get an awsome skyping device and home teather conectivity for sixty bucks , still a heck of a lot cheaper than the pro&rsquo;s &ldquo; included &rdquo; 100 buck soundcard ;)as for construction, its made of plastic, but it is sturdy, think about the contruction of your average sony/samsung/whatever laptop, it is plastic , but resistant one at that, volume faders feel solid, with a slight resistance to them , much like the eq and filter knobs , the crossfader is very loose as youd expect, a little TOO loose for my taste but also a preference thing, platters are the highlight of the controller , made out of metal and capacitative means very sensitive, also double function, scratch by using the top part (wich is also sensitive and will stop the track just like you would a record by putting your finger on top of it) or you can use it for tempo nudging by using the sidesin conclusion, as youd expect from a numark product, you get a quality device , with what i would call an amazing feature package for the price range @ 150 dollars, and if you add a good external sound card you get a much better deal out of the cash than if you would go for the pro version just for the soundcard, heck youc an buy a cheap 5 buck usb card but i recommend a better one with dedicated drivers , work much better than asio and can sample higher (bheringer audio interface here on amazon is also good for less than 30 )Hope that helps your decision , happy mixing !EDIT: And just to adress those people giving bad reviews because of the software and whatnot, if you cant READ beforehand and realize you have to download the software , and buy or &ldquo; obtain&rdquo; the pro software , they probably will never professionally dj anyways, so take my advice and ignore it, the virtual dj intro software is still good for playing , just dosnt have all the features that the pro version has, if you are so inclined to buy a program i recommend traktor, much more powerful with features and remix decks and its a one time 99 fee for the full pro 2 version , if not you can always sub to virtual dj for a low monthly fee , and if you do ONE gig a month it more than pays for itself just my 2 c</p>
