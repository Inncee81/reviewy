<h5 id="i-will-never-be-without-this">I will never be without this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to admit, that after reading the varied reviews from &ldquo;trash&rdquo; to &ldquo;excellent buy&rdquo;, I was somewhat nervous about buying this. I far from rich, so could not afford to spend this much money on a mistake. However, it has made it so that clothes, towels, etc. that are washed before I go to bed are always dry before I get up the next morning. Even when it is raining.This is NOT a clothes dryer. It does the same thing as the spin cycle in your washer - but does a better job than even Laundromat spin cycles. I wash most of our clothes by hand using the EasyGo Washer Mobile Hand Powered Washing Machine. I then hang the clothes in a bathtub that is no longer used for bathing to dry. They used to take a day or two at least to dry.Using this spin dryer, even the heaviest of garments dry overnight even in rainy weather. This includes thick cotton towels, cloth diapers and even denim. I do my wash before bedtime now and wake to clean &amp; dry clothes for everyone.It has a generous dent in the front for you to place a bucket under to catch water but I do not use it. Instead, I just set it in the bathtub when I am using it and remove it when done. It is fairly light. The handle makes it fairly convenient to move in and out of the tub.I should mention that it is nearly silent in use.I do not see this product lasting under my abuse for more than 2 years; however, it will pay for itself in about 3 months in savings by not having to go to the Laundromat except for blankets which I cannot wash by hand.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="really-like-it-a-few-questions-remain">Really like it; a few questions remain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(Initial review on unpacking day &ndash; will update after a week or two of use.)The dryer was lighter than expected (but not so light as to feel cheap). Build quality is good; packaging is tight fitting to protect it during shipping. Note: you must find and remove the shipping immobilizer under the base &ndash; this is BOTH the metal angle iron and the heavy-duty plastic zip-tie holding it in place. The zip-tie is tricky to get out, even after cutting it open with scissors. If either is not removed, the spinning mechanism can be damaged. There is an X-shaped styrofoam spacer filling up the clothes chamber inside at the top to stabilize it during shipping &ndash; remove it, but be prepared to vacuum out zillions of annoying styrofoam bits afterwards. Finally, DON&rsquo;T FORGET to set up a bowl or small bucket under the water drain spout at the bottom front!Use was simple and much faster than I expected &ndash; just put in wet clothes no higher than the top of the inner chamber, slide in the flexible pink safety cover on top of the clothes but under the inner chamber rim, plug in the dryer, and close the hatch, which locks and activates the spinning. Warning: I suggest leaning with some weight on the lid/dryer when you start it up, because if it is unbalanced, it will buck all over the place. With experience in loading my clothes, I have reduced the number of bucking incidents and hope to pretty much eliminate them. Assuming no bucking, the dryer quickly spins up to very high speed and water starts gushing out the drain spout in front. (This is when you will remember to put a dish/bucket in front if you haven&rsquo;t already! :) ) Once the water slows to individual drips, you are done. This usually happened within a minute or two for my loads of heavy-duty cotton T-shirts &amp; cotton underwear. The clothes came out surprisingly dry, definitely dryer than from my traditional full-size top-loading washer.Why I didn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars (for now):1) I will upload photos of the machine and manual; the manual says the warranty is only 1 year, while the listing says 3 years. I have a request into Amazon to find out what&rsquo;s going on here. Even if it&rsquo;s only a 1 year warranty, SquareTrade sells an appliance 3-year warranty here on Amazon for about 10% of the price of the dryer.2) Small capacity. Initially, it seems to fit only about 4 heavy-duty thick men&rsquo;s cotton T-shirts at a time; I suspect I will be able to add some socks and underwear at the same time as my loading skills improve.3) Sensitivity to uneven loading. I may change my mind on this as I improve my loading skills with practice. It seems likely the best way to load it is to put the heaviest/largest items in first, and to extend each item in a circle shape around the center as much as possible, forming a donut-shaped pile of clothes at the bottom.That said, I really like this machine:-) It&rsquo;s easy to move around and compact. I keep it next to my small table in the bathroom, then move it next to the sink and outlet when I want to use it.-) It&rsquo;s very quiet &ndash; quieter than my bathroom exhaust fan (unless it starts bucking!).-) It&rsquo;s ridiculously fast &ndash; a few minutes and it&rsquo;s spun out all the water it can, leaving the clothes surprisingly dry.-) It&rsquo;s easy to use, without any parts that look like they will break easily.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="really-spins-out-water">Really spins out water!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this yesterday after purchasing from the manufacturer. I tried it on some of my son&rsquo;s clothes and it really spun out the water (they were polyester) to the point of coming out almost dry. I was impressed as to how quiet it is as well. The feet really grip the hard floor so there is only a little wobble when it gets started. I will update my review after I have used it for a longer time and with larger loads. One think to remember is when you first get it there is a metal rod attached to the bottom with a zip tie. At first I thought it was a drain spout extension and plugged in the machine. I quickly realized that it is there to keep the machine from bouncing around in transit and that it must be removed before plugging it in. I literally had it plugged for 2 seconds and quickly unplugged before any damage occurred, but I could see someone burning out the motor if they left it attached and plugged in longer. In my directions there was nothing written about removing it first (guess it was obvious). But I just thought I&rsquo;d share with anyone else who purchases this. Also it is larger than I thought and should hold many clothes.</p>

<h5 id="love">love!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Most amazing thing ever! I have no idea how I didn&rsquo;t know about this product sooner.I live in a NYC apartment with my husband and 2 kids. We accumulate a lot of laundry!!!! Not only is it terribly expensive, it takes up so much time!I recently found about about a small device to wash clothes in a bucket in minutes. Right after I ordered that, I found this. First I didn&rsquo;t think I needed it, but if you&rsquo;ve ever rung out 4 peoples worth of laundry by hand, you&rsquo;d see that you do. I thought my hands were going to fall off.My mother in law bought this for me for my birthday and I did 4 small loads of laundry that day!!! I&rsquo;ve been doing 1 small load a night and with this spinner, it&rsquo;s dry by morning. It has probably saved my sanity.</p>
