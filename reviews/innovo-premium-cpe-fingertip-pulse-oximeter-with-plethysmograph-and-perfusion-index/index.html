<p>Color:Cloud White
The Innovo Premium CPE Fingertip pulse oximeter shows your measured SpO2 and Pulse Rate on a high quality OLED screen (with six multidirectional display choices) and come with two critically acclaimed features, the Plethysmograph and Perfusion Index (PI), that will improve the reliability of the readings dramatically. Each wave corresponds to a heartbeat and the amplitude to the amount of blood detected in your blood vessels. When the height of the wave amplitude no longer fluctuates, this means that the pulse oximeter is now optimized and you may now take the readings. Meanwhile, the PI conveniently informs you of the strength of your pulse. If the PI value is less than 0.2%, this means that your hands are too cold or improperly positioned in the pulse oximeter. Simply warm your finger and reposition it so that it is right under the LED lights. No more second guessing if the readings are reliable or why the pulse oximeter is not giving a reading. Using a vastly improved sensor, the Innovo deluxe pulse oximeter can also now correct for small movements, allowing more versatile usage. Comes with a lanyard and 2 AAA batteries so that you can use the pulse oximeter right out of the box. Please note that this is not a medical device. Intended use for spot check of blood oxygen saturation level at home, in sport and recreational use, such as mountain climbing, high-altitude activities and running. The oximeter might not work on kids or adults with small fingers. Innovo® is a registered trademark of USPTO. We will actively and aggressively pursue any parties who infringe on our intellectual property rights to the maximum extent allowed by the law. Beware of Imitation, Buy Original. Innovo® Pulse Oximeter is designed in USA.</p>

<p>This pulse oximeter is sold for sports and aviation use only.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-little-pulse-oximeter">This is a great little pulse oximeter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little pulse oximeter! It&rsquo;s a much better quality oximeter than I have seen before. It is very simple to use and measure your heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. It gives fast and accurate measurements and the screen is easy to read and see. It gets readings in 10 seconds. It&rsquo;s just the regular finger clip. This comes in handy when you&rsquo;re working out exercising or working outside in the hot summer sun. The LED screen is large and easy to read. It is a simple one button operation. It includes a lanyard. This is much faster to measure your pulse rate and accurate - than to count it on your own and needing complete silence. It takes two AAA batteries to operate and they are included. It&rsquo;s really a great, handy item to have around. I like teaching my children about what their bodies do and how they work - so this is nice for that also. I do like having this for outdoor sports when it&rsquo;s really hot - to make sure the body is where it should be. I really love this pulse oximeter and I would recommend this product to anybody.</p>

<h5 id="pleased-purchase-of-oximeter">Pleased purchase of oximeter.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with my new Innovo oximeter. I was a little confused with the plethymograph waveform and sent a note about my concern. I have atrial fibrillation. This device shows the missed beat in the waveform. Amazing and interesting. I also have COPD. My old oximeter gave the sats okay but my new oximeter has more features that are helpful. I received a reply from a consumer and also one from Sara of Innovo. She explained my concern. I was very surprised to receive an answer directly from Innovo. I am happy that I purchased the oximeter with its great features from Innovo. I intend to show this oximeter to my cardiologist and pulmonologist at my next visit. Neither doctor has an oximeter with these features. Should I require any other devices I&rsquo;ll certainly contact your fine company.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-favorite-pulse-oximeter">My favorite pulse oximeter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a home hospice nurse. This is my fourth pulse oximeter, and my favorite. I like the perfusion index % (PI%) indicator, which tells you whether a low pulsox reading is likely to be accurate, or whether it&rsquo;s due to poor circulation. It also has a pleth wave, which helps you quickly find a finger with a good pulse likely to provide an accurate reading. It appears to be well made, and the price is great. I have only had it for a week, so I can&rsquo;t speak to durability or battery life just yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a Registered Nurse and use this every day It is well made and gives accurate readings</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-1">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product works great. Purchased it for my mother who was discharged from the hospital on oxygen after an ugly fight with pneumonia. We mainly use it to monitor oxygen saturation and its easy to use. We attached the lanyard to her walker. Its easy to use. Still need to look into what all the other vitals on the device are monitoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This oximeter is great. Love the wave feature. My husband has A-fib and we are find ourselves on top of this issue because of the accurate reading we get with our Innovo Premium Pulse Oximeter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-product">Terrific product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works perfectly. I believe it is very accurate because I used it while I was on my spin bike and wearing another heart monitor that strapped around my chest and the numbers were the same. Super easy to take with me and I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. I am recommending it to my sister too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-little-device">Amazing little device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing little device. I keep it with me wherever i go. Having just come out of the hospital, i like to know what my HR is at certain times when i feel it racing. I do notice that the heart rate number jumps up and down with each breath. Is this normal? I am using my index finger and staying still when i use it. The oxygen reading never seems to go above 96%, while my galaxy s8 reads 100% sometimes. I would honestly trust this more than my phones reader though. I love this thing though, it seems like any finger size will fit and it registers the reading immediately. I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a pulse oximeter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-a-pulse-ox-for-the-normal-consumer-who-wants-to-test-their-oxygenation-it-gets-five-stars">As a pulse ox for the normal consumer who wants to test their oxygenation it gets five stars.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For people who need a pulse ox this definitely fits the bill. It appears to be accurate when compared to other devices. It is simple to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quick-readings-and-gorgeous-display">Quick readings and gorgeous display</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good and very easy to use oximeter. This one is replacing an older (10 years+) meter that I&rsquo;ve been using and right out of the gate I noticed how much faster it is to get readings&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small and convenient. Perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-fun-gadget-but-you-aren-t-to-use-it-for-health">A fun gadget but you aren&rsquo;t to use it for &ldquo;health.&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fascinating little device. I give it four stars rather than 5 simply because the manufacturer points out that &ldquo;this is not a medical device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this from my sister as a gift when I become a nurse. It reads accurate and I love it very much</p>
