H1 Features at a glance:
The H1 Handy Recorder puts all its functions at your fingertips. No menus! Its backlit display features recording levels, file format, time elapsed, remaining battery life and recording time.
Its intuitive transport puts all the controls on the side with no menus on the screen. A large record button gives you complete control. Playback and pause, marker, forward and rewind buttons are all accessible by your thumb. Volume for playback and monitoring can be adjusted using your index finger.</p>

<p>On the back, you&rsquo;ll find a single AA battery compartment, a tripod mount, low cut filter, auto level setting and recording format selectable switches. There&rsquo;s also convenient mount for a strap or lanyard clip.
All the transport controls are on right side of the H1 and you can adjust recording levels on the fly. A <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch stereo line input is located on this side and its USB port is also accessible here as is its power on and hold switch.</p>

<p>On the left side, you can replace your microSD card by folding down the rubberized door. There&rsquo;s also a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch stereo line/headphone output with adjustable volume control for monitoring playback. The built-in reference speaker is on the bottom of the unit.</p>

<p>What sets Zoom apart?
Like all Zoom recorders, the H1&rsquo;s onboard microphones are configured in an X/Y pattern, for stunning stereo imaging. Because both mics are arranged on the same axis, they are equidistant from the sound source for perfect localization and no phase shifting. The result is great stereo recordings with natural depth and accurate imaging.</p>

<p>Under your thumb…
With its newly designed user interface, the H1 is also our easiest recorder to use. All its functions are at your fingertips, such as track marker, auto record, low cut filter, level and volume controls with on-board buttons…No menus required!</p>

<p>Intuitive controls make it easy to capture the audio you need with ease. But it still provides the versatility you&rsquo;ve come to expect from Zoom. So you get total recording format flexibility from 16-bit/44.1 kHz to 24-bit/96 kHz WAV, or MP3 from 48 kbps to 320 kbps and enough tools onboard to make impeccable recordings.</p>

<p>Secure your digital memories.
The H1 records on microSD cards and comes with a 2GB card. Using a 32 GB microSD card allows over 50 hours of recording time at 16-bit/44.1 kHz. MicroSD cards were specifically designed for the ever-evolving mobile technology market. Approximately the size of a fingernail, the microSD card is a significant advance in technology and its size and capacity are a major reason why the H1 is able to deliver so much recording technology in such a small package.</p>

<p>Share the love.
With its Hi-Speed USB 2.0 port, the H1 allows for fast transfer of your audio files to your computer. Listen, edit and share with your fans on your Mac or PC. It also includes a reference speaker to ensure your recordings are being captured as you desire.</p>

<p>Musicians - Shorten the Learning Curve
With stereo recording so precise and so easy, musicians will love the H1. An indispensible part of any serious musician&rsquo;s arsenal, the H1 makes recording rehearsals and practice sessions easier than ever. And the best part is, because your performance is captured with crystal clear audio, you can really critique your own playing, and get better.</p>

<p>Songwriters - More Hit Wonders
Isn&rsquo;t it time you heard your masterpieces in beautiful stereo that rivals a professional recording studio? Zoom knows you&rsquo;re the creative type, not an engineer. That&rsquo;s why Zoom made the H1 so easy to setup and navigate. So you can keep the inspiration going. Your most creative ideas can now be recorded and shared with your co-writers anywhere and at anytime the music hits you. Just be sure you have your H1 on at all times!</p>

<p>Bands - On the Road, On the Run.
There are so many applications for your band and the H1. Start with learning new songs. If you&rsquo;re the guy who teaches the songs, record each part on an H1 and email it to the members of your band. If you&rsquo;re the one who books the band, you band needs to get heard. And everyone in the group needs to hear their performance to get better. The H1 makes capturing your performance easy, even when you&rsquo;re cranking out high SPLs.</p>

<p>Video and Film Professionals - Indie Shoots That Don&rsquo;t Sound Indie.
With DSLR cameras that shoot incredible HD video, the need for a better audio solution has emerged. The H1 will easily shoe mount on top of a video or DSLR camera. And because it has a standard <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-20 mount on the bottom, you can place the H1 anywhere on your rig. Use the stereo output jack to connect directly to the audio input on your camera, or bring the audio into your editing suite using the USB connection. The H1 is the perfect entry point for those getting started with dual source shooting.</p>

<p>Journalism - Scoop Central…
These days, a journalist needs the ablility to capture broadcast ready interviews whenever or wherever they occur. Imagine being able to spontaneously capture the kind of audio your producer needs and send it remotely via email. That&rsquo;s what the H1 provides. It&rsquo;s literally a recording studio in your pocket! And the files are Broadcast Wave Format (BWF) so your producer has time and date stamping as well as any markers you set for total editing ease.</p>

<p>Business - Content Management
Whether it&rsquo;s a sales meeting, training conference or a seminar, the ability to capture and distribute the content is a big part of the ROI when you do events. Use the H1 to record your content for your company website or distribute it by email to your peers. Edit and turn it into a podcast. The possibilities are endless. Whatever the use, the H1 is perfect for legal, business and medical field use.</p>

<p>Accessorize the size…
Everything you need to get started recording is included. Your H1 comes with an AA battery for 10 hours of operation and a 2 GB microSD card.</p>

<p>In addition, an H1 accessory package (APH-1) is also available with an array of accessories that make your recordings even more pristine and easier to capture. The accessory kit includes a windscreen, AC adapter (USB type), USB cable, adjustable tripod stand, padded-shell case and a mic clip adapter.</p>

<h5 id="zoom-h1-vs-tascam-dr-05">Zoom H1 vs Tascam DR-05</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was on the Zoom H1 for about 6 months, and its so small i lost track of it. So i picked up a Tascam DR-05 and now that i have tried them side by side, i can say this simply about the differences:Zoom H1 - Good sound, exceptional 1 button operation. I have the special edition white H1. It is much easier to see the labels and controls than on the black model in a dark studio or on a stage.You can hear the H1: www.thewooks.net. I have live recordings up. OPL Sets 1 and 2 are through the H1 mics. The studio recordings include SweetLiz, Wook Walk and anything at the bottom of that page that is not obviously live (everything live is from the OPL concert, FWIW).Tascam DR-05 - Great sound, 3 click operation to start, stop, pause. Can be a little confusing, even just setting the levels on the fly. However, the sound quality is a notch above the H1. Its now my go to for recording our band through the headphone mix.I did find my HI BTW, had fallen between my seat and rear door after a gig. Now i swap off, I&rsquo;m using them both, and they are both excellent. The H1 is just wayyyy easier to use.</p>

<h5 id="good-not-excellent">Good, not excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pros: Good, yet not excellent quality of recorded sound; Very easy to operate. I found and watched one about 10-minute long video on youtube, instead of reading the manual and it was enough to know everything about every function of this Zoom H1; Easy to see all the buttons and markings on white background of this special edition white unit.The Cons: quite outdated. The system files present on the recorder were dated 2009 and 2010. The alkaline AA battery included with it was almost dead, died out completely after about 30 minutes of use; It has an old, outdated mini USB plug; It picks up incredible amounts of wind noise, as well as breathing noise when placed close to mouth. Definitely needs a wind screen (an additional $10-14 expemse); Without a wind screen, on a quiet day with very little wind present, the wind background noise makes near impossible to hear the main recording; Has no automatic shut-off (at least I was unable to find such a setting and on its own it just doesn&rsquo;t shut itself off).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-buy">Must buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this thing. I didn&rsquo;t know portable recorders would cost so much. Since this was the cheapest with the highest ratings, I decided to give it a try.Wow. The quality is superb and it&rsquo;s functions are really easy to figure out. I am a newb to this stuff, and I learned a lot using this, and found it is way easier than one can imagine.I had the wrong lavaliere I bought for it, and almost returned it, but the customer representative was quick to respond and helped me figure out that I needed a separate type of lavaliere, or an adapter.The sound quality is just fantastic, and the stereo pans just right.The rings around the microphone seem like they might be easy to break, so I bought a case to go with it.And the other problem is, holding it. When recording with an external microphone, you&rsquo;ll hear your hand rubbing all over it. So get a cheap shock holder for it and it is better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-sensitive-i-hear-stuff-i-never-did-before">Very sensitive. I hear stuff I never did before.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live about a block and a half from a stop light. With this running through my headset, I can hear cars stop at that stop light. Sometimes I can make out what song they are playing before the light changes. I bought the kit that goes with too. Holding this in your hand without a tripod, it picks up on every hand movement. I think I can even hear my heartbeat in the recordings, but I might be imagining that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-super-impressed-with-this-thing">I&rsquo;m super impressed with this thing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m super impressed with this thing. Granted I don&rsquo;t have much experience in the audio world, so maybe I&rsquo;m just easily impressed. I&rsquo;m a dog trainer and make some basic instructional videos. A lot of time these are done on the fly and I just use my phone for the video. However, even with little clip on shotgun mics I still wasn&rsquo;t getting the sound I wanted. So in comes this thing. Pop it in my pocket. Record as far away as I want. Throw a deadcat muffler on it when it&rsquo;s windy, and not have to wait to film until the wind dies down. Then I just pair up the audio on iMovie which only takes a tiny bit of extra time and I&rsquo;m good to go. I also have recently found myself using it frequently with my assistant. I&rsquo;ll record blog posts, emails, etc., while I&rsquo;m driving down the road and then have her transcribe them. It&rsquo;s fantastic! Super easy to use for a total novice like me too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not very experienced with this type of hand held recorder, (read I&rsquo;ve used one, and only for three days,) but the recording sounds very good, and it is easy enough for me to use. I am currently listening to a recording of a discussion, made with this recorder. I have not used the included software. I recommend Audacity, which is open source and therefore free to download and is a very powerful audio editor. I also have not used it plugged directly into the computer to use as a USB microphone, but I&rsquo;m sure that it will work well for that application based on the quality of the recordings that I have made. If you intend to record outside or in a room with a lot of air flow you will need some kind of wind protection. I plan to find a dead cat wind screen and get one of those. I am happy with it, and do recommend it if you are looking for a hand held stand alone recording device.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-i-don-t-have-professional-needs-so-it-s-perfect">So far so good. I don&rsquo;t have professional needs so it&rsquo;s perfect &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a novice with sound recording devices. So far so good. I don&rsquo;t have professional needs so it&rsquo;s perfect for me.I like the option of compressed (mp3) or uncompressed(Wav).It great for recording in my immediate environment.Even lightly touching it is recorded, but I suspect that is normal behavior.A minor Con - the usb connector is Mini-B, so it&rsquo;s my only device with that connector.the chip with it is only 2G, but it can handle 32g (and they are cheap now days).It uses a single AA battery. I suspect it will use rechargables.It&rsquo;s got jacks for earphones and Mic, and a mounting hole for a tripod.It has a speaker in the bottom so it will do playback, but it clearly is not designed as HiFi player.</p>

<p>This makes good recordings, but it arrived broken. The switch that toggled between MP3 and WAV recordings didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Been using this with a Rode VideoMic Pro. Amazing how the audio from my Rode improved 10 fold just by using this Zoom H1 instead if feeding it into my camera. Super impressed.</p>
