<p>HotLogic Mini Personal Portable Oven
Smart Shelf Technology automatically cooks food to perfection while you go about your busy day
Revolutionizing the hot meal experience! The patented Hot Logic Mini is a personal portable oven great for the office, the job site, the campsite or anywhere you have an outlet. Now you can enjoy fresh-cooked hot meals, reheated meals or perfectly cooked prepackaged meals anywhere. The Hot Logic Mini slowly and evenly heats your meal to preserve moisture and enhance flavor. No super-hot overcooked edges, no frozen centers and no worries about sharing a dirty microwave.</p>

<p>Attractive, portable case available in four colors
Heat reflective interior – amplifies/maintains heat
Reinforced seams – durable
Double zipper – quality construction
Smart Shelf technology – no buttons, bells or programs
Ultra Energy Efficient – uses less energy than a microwave
Suitable for plastic, metal, glass, aluminum foil and cardboard containers!
UL CSA certified</p>

<p>HOW IT WORKS</p>

<p>Place food in tote - Choose your favorite fresh or prepared meal from the refrigerator or freezer.</p>

<p>Go about your day - Simply plug in the HotLogic Mini and enjoy your daily activities knowing that your HotLogic Mini is safely warming your meal.</p>

<p>Eat and enjoy - This is the best part. You deserve to enjoy a wonderful hot meal.The HotLogic Mini makes sure it&rsquo;s cooked to perfection and ready when you are.</p>

<p>As with most first-of-its-kind products, HotLogic is not the easiest to explain to someone who hasn&rsquo;t used it before. Imagine trying to explain what a vacuum cleaner to someone who lived in the 1850s or explaining a microwave to your great grandmother when she was a girl.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;slow cooking oven&rdquo; is an accurate description of HotLogic, and one we use sometimes when we&rsquo;re using it more like an oven. The truth is that this isn&rsquo;t 100% accurate simply because it&rsquo;s not broad enough. HotLogic can also be used to reheat food perfectly without overcooking it, so it&rsquo;s kind of like a microwave…kind of. When you&rsquo;re cooking slow roasts, baked potatoes or the sort, you can use it like a crock pot (that knows when to turn off and stop cooking things to mush).</p>

<p>HotLogic may be like all these things, but it still doesn&rsquo;t come close to being in the same category with any of them.</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t HotLogic fit into any of these categories? Because of one simple reason: Unlike all these other appliances, HotLogic is timeless. Not in the classic design sense, but quite literally: HotLogic removes any and all time constraints to your meal times. Once it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s ready – right then, or 12 hours from then. The amount of time you wait to eat it won&rsquo;t make your meal overcooked, or mushy, or with crispy edges.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re cooking uncooked, frozen chicken breasts with fresh beans on top or reheating last night&rsquo;s pizza: HotLogic knows when you&rsquo;re meal is cooked, and when it is, it holds it at a save, delicious temperature until you&rsquo;re ready to eat it.</p>

<p>THIS is what makes HotLogic so difficult to describe. It does something that literally NOTHING else can do! It frees you from checking the crock pot, sticking around the house because the oven is on, and relying on the microwave&rsquo;s always-inconsistent reheating.</p>

<p>All it takes is the tiniest shift in how you go about your day. Planning just 12 hours ahead can make the difference between breakfast that&rsquo;s hot and ready for you when you wake up and dinner that&rsquo;s ready for you when you get home from work, and a day dictated by meal prep times.</p>

<p>Save money – hot meals without the expense of eating out</p>

<p>Eat healthy – home cooked meals so you know what&rsquo;s in it</p>

<p>Convenient – plug it in and it cooks while you work or play</p>

<p>Super Efficient – costs less than a penny per meal</p>

<p>Easy – no programs or buttons to push, use almost any type of flat bottom, sealed container</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a fitness journey for nearly a year now and had even started meal prepping as I didn&rsquo;t want all my hard workouts to go to waste by eating unhealthy. But I often didn&rsquo;t have time to leave my desk at work to head to the break room to heat up my meals&hellip; Besides that the times I did a few of my co workers made rude comments on my meals and portion control as they grubbed on their greasy fast food&hellip;Which made it a bit awkward. so I found this thing here on Amazon and it&rsquo;s worked perfectly for my needs :) I can now heat my food while working and without leaving my desk so I no longer have to hear my co workers negative remarks and comments!As a side note if you purchase this, i&rsquo;d recommended looking into the 2 compartment meal prepping containers as the fit is perfect! I&rsquo;ve added a few pics as reference.</p>

<h5 id="great-buy-for-a-person-that-travels">Great buy for a person that travels.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great buy! I travel for work and got sick of eating salads and cold sandwiches in my hotel room trying to avoid spending 30 bucks on room service for a burger and fries. Once I received the unit I did some testing. I put two cold raw chicken breasts in the pyrex and put <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup of water to braise/poach. In exactly 2 hours and 30 minutes the chicken was 165.8 which is a safe temp for poultry. If I loaded this up with lots of veggies over the chicken I would probably cook a minimum of 3 hours.</p>

<h5 id="great-alternative-to-a-microwave">Great alternative to a microwave</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was surprised no one had written a review about this product so I thought I&rsquo;d give my two cents.I work in a cubicle (decorated with a red stapler and iniTECH mug) and don&rsquo;t have room for a microwave. The only other option is to use the company microwave that reeks of old food and crushed dreams. This being said I needed a compact alternative to lugging in a microwave and replacing my computer with it, which I feel my boss would frown upon.This Mini Personal Oven is great for this. It&rsquo;s really just a hotplate and a bag but the setup is clean and simple. I plug it in and it keeps my lunch that I bring from home hot and ready to eat. It takes food about 45-60 minutes to heat up but once it is it will keep it at a nice hot temperature but not too hot that you&rsquo;d burn yourself. I believe it&rsquo;s right about 150 degrees from what I read on the company website. It&rsquo;s compact and convenient. Any standard Tupperware fits in there, although it doesn&rsquo;t stand very tall so you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to put a plastic bowl in there. And as long as it&rsquo;s sealed tight the food won&rsquo;t start to permeate the lining which I would imagine it being similar to smelling like a gym bag.The only thing I didn&rsquo;t enjoy was that there isn&rsquo;t an on off switch, that&rsquo;s controlled by simply plugging it in. Other than that, great product.I&rsquo;d recommend this to anyone who has the spacial limitations and need something to keep their food warm until lunch time. Because your lunch won&rsquo;t judge you.Oh and it&rsquo;s Blue! So, there&rsquo;s that. It&rsquo;s a color. I hope you like Blue. I like Blue.</p>

<h5 id="can-i-give-it-100-stars">Can I give it 100 stars?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Where has this been all of my life. This is amazing. I have had this for a couple of months and have been waiting for something not to be good. Well, that has not happened. I have heated up so many different items and each item is heated to hot, as long as I give it enough time.If you are heating up a frozen store meal I suggest you heat it up 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 2 hrs to be fully heated. If you are heating something from home it will take less time about 1 hr. I have heated up a pint sized container of frozen chili or pot roast at work, started at 8:30, ate at 1:00 and it was hot, that I had to let it cool a little before eaten. Heated up tuna casserole and the noodles did not overcook, it was like it just came out of the oven.What I really like about this is that the items, once heated, seem to stay hot longer than a microwave and taste like they were just cooked.The most amazing think I heated up was a hamburger I grilled to medium rare figuring if I reheated it (like in the microwave) it would be cooked to almost well. Let me tell you it did cook the burger a little more, almost to a medium, but it was juicy like it just came off the grill. I even put a piece of cheese on the burger &amp; it melted perfectly. (I have a picture of the heated items and the burger cut in half so you can see how it heated it up.)So far I have heated: microwave meals, hamburgers (refrigerated &amp; cooked frozen), bratwurst (refrigerated &amp; cooked frozen), , mac &amp; cheese, spaghetti, soup and chili (refrigerated &amp; cooked frozen), frozen pot roast and veggies, cabbage rolls broccoli, mashed potatoes, ribs, pulled pork, barbeque chicken on the bone, meatloaf, pork loin roast.The other nice this about this is that it looks like a regular lunch box &amp; no one will know you are heating your lunch if they don&rsquo;t see the plug.If you have something with a crunchy topping or crust it is a little soggy, but for everything else it does I can live with that.If you want something to heat up quickly go to the office microwave, it you want something that tastes more like it was just made this is for you.Can you tell I really really like this?</p>
