<p>Style:7&rsquo;6&rdquo; Light Stand Kit - HTC Vive Edition
Product Overview</p>

<p>The StudioPRO Set of Two 7&rsquo;6&rdquo; Photo Video Light Stands w/Ball Head Mount is the perfect kit for setting up your HTC Vive. The Vive Base Stations need to be positioned at least 6 feet high, face each other, and stand pointed toward your &ldquo;play area&rdquo;. With this kit, you will not have to mount the base stations directly onto your wall. Instead, you can easily set them up and move them around with the two light stands. The mini ball head mount operates with an adjustable swivel bracket, enabling you to pivot and turn the base stations any direction. </p>

<p>The ball head mount can also attach to your DSLR camera, and be mounted onto tripods and monopods for photography or videography. This kit also includes a light weight carrying bag for traveling or storage when not in use. The foam padded walls help protect your equipment from becoming damaged. This bag makes it possible to pack up your play area or studio anytime, anywhere. </p>

<p>Note: VR electronics sold separately.</p>

<h5 id="tripod-for-htc-vive">tripod for HTC Vive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these to use for the IR lighthouse units on the HTC Vive. They work perfectly for this purpose, very stable, no wobble at all. They are sturdy and seem to be built well. Very small foot print on the floor so if you are tight on space these will work well, if you have more space you can widen them for more stability but even at max height they do not move at all. Even with the slight vibration these boxes generate. Coupled with the tripod ball head bracket and it&rsquo;s a complete solution for your VR space.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-small-stand-for-ringlight-or-other-options-quite-durable">Great small stand for ringlight or other options. Quite durable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I reviewed this previously, but I guess I didn&rsquo;t. I needed something to hold my ring light on a table as my larger stand was just too tall. I have an 18 inch ring light so it can be quite top heavy, but I position the legs of this stand so that it keeps it balanced and I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with toppling over. This thing is sturdy, I&rsquo;m very impressed with how well it is made and how durable it is. I use it several times a week for hours on end and it doesn&rsquo;t have any issues. If you are looking for a small table top stand, I highly suggest this one as it is affordable and really holds up well. I&rsquo;m impressed for sure. I do suggest that you not put it on a slippery surface. I place it on a table top that is not slippery and it stays, but on my table that is slightly slippery, it can slide. Otherwise, it works really well.</p>

<h5 id="must-have-for-the-vive-users-that-travel-or-cant-perm-mount-their-lighthouses">Must have for the VIVE users that travel, or cant perm mount their lighthouses.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cant beat the price point for these units. Others will be 30 - 40 for one stand. This pack i bought for my VIVE setup because im at a location where i cant perm mount my lighthouses. These units arrived on time, and were very quick to setup. I was worried about the quality of both the bases and the ball mounts but i was very surprised to see both are great quality. They have some weight to them (which is a good indicator of quality) but never fear they are easy to carry and hardly noticeable. I was worried they would tip on their own but just a bit of common sense with the bases to make sure they are spread out the higher you deploy them helps keep them moving at all. The added springs they have to help pop out the grip points makes it nice and easy to extend and you don&rsquo;t feel your jamming it back in every time and screwing it down. I will suggest to any VIVE owners out there.Literally the only criticism i would offer the company, would be one of two items. Reduce the size of the bag, because even after both units are in the carry case it has a lot of wasted space. However since it is not a hard cover putting items in there are at risk of rubbing against the poles. Alternatively</p>

<h5 id="holding-up-my-lightboxes">Holding up my lightboxes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are perfect for holding the HTC Vive light boxes. I have moved my Vive four times since I have purchased these and every time these have been a perfect fit for setting up my space. If you can&rsquo;t put holes in the wall or like me, like to take your Vive to parties, this is the solution. The included bag is generic, as it is bigger than the 2 stands combined, but it helps keep them stored when not in use and easy to carry around, with space for anything else you want to throw in there. I have a regular tripod for a video camera in there now. The only issue I have had, and it was only a minor irk, is that the lighthouses have a slight vibration to them and the spring inside the pole picked up on this vibration making a slight metallic shaking sound. It is all in the extension and placement of the stand that makes the difference with that though.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-with-a-really-convienent-carrying-bag-included-perfect-for-the-vive-vr-system">Great product with a really convienent carrying bag included, Perfect for the Vive VR system!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product shiped in a box the size of the bag with the tripods themselves safely secured inside the bag in their own individual boxes. The Vive light box attachments outside the bag. Setup was extremely easy and the tripods seems stable and allow me to angle the Vive&rsquo;s two lightboxes as easily as the original mounts did. This product makes placing the Vive VR headset&rsquo;s two light boxes very easy and allows for easy mobility if you ever want to travel with the equpiment or move it from room to room. A lot nicer than the headset&rsquo;s included wall mount. At the price I paid($44) I would call this a must have for any Vive owner!</p>

<h5 id="these-tripods-seem-to-be-very-good-quality-and-quite-rugged-enough-for-their-designed">These tripods seem to be very good quality, and quite rugged enough for their designed &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These tripods seem to be very good quality, and quite rugged enough for their designed task. You still don&rsquo;t want to have anyone crashing into (or tripping over) them, but that&rsquo;s just as much for the protection of the equipment that you have mounted on them.My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that when I originally opened the package, I didn&rsquo;t immediately see the ball heads, an I thought that I had received the wrong unit, but the heads were bagged separately in the bottom of the carrying bag.FWIW: I am choosing to store the tripods inside the little cardboard boxes, inside the carrying bag. That way they don&rsquo;t scratch each other up during transport.Bottom line: These are good tripods. If you need good tripods, get these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="from-a-video-pro">From a video pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used the kit about 10 times so far. I purchased them for the extended height and the bag. Overall, excellent for the price. I gave it 4 stars for two complaints: 1) At full height there is an unacceptable wobble. The lights used are within the manufacture weight limit spec. Lowering each segment 2 - 4&rdquo; provides stability. I found the usable height is around seven feet. 2) The shock spring on each segment is probably intended to dampen the shock of a falling segment when a novice user forgets to hold the segment before releasing a lock. Personally, I find it annoying while storing. The segment locks are very good. The bag has space for additional items. I store the stands in their cardboard boxes for better organization which allows me to include two smaller stands, flex arms for other lights, gels and other grip items.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-there-is-for-portable-vive-base-station-stands">The best there is for portable vive base station stands</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are perfect for the Vive base stations, don&rsquo;t take up space, and won&rsquo;t fall over. They can be adjusted any way you want and the stands can also be used for cameras/lights.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked just like they should. Seem to be good quality.. Work great for my Vive VR Light boxes</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bang-for-the-buck">Bang for the buck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly good for being so inexpensive. I&rsquo;ve had the up at full height with a 600 ws strobe and 60&rdquo; umbrella with no issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice product .. my only complaint is that that the higher it goes the more shaky it becomes bur that&rsquo;s kinda obvious</p>

<h5 id="not-for-heavy-use">Not for heavy use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They were very rickety even with light LED lights on top. Lots of plastic knobs too. Love getting a case though.</p>

<h5 id="compacts-into-a-smallish-bag-for-easy-transportation-around-the-house-or-wherever-you-may-need">Compacts into a smallish bag for easy transportation around the house or wherever you may need &hellip;</h5>

<p>Exactly what I was looking for for my Vive. The top reaches high up and the bottom is stable. Compacts into a smallish bag for easy transportation around the house or wherever you&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-vive">Perfect for Vive!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Affordable and sturdy. But most importantly, if you are unsure where exactly to place your Vive base stations these give you the flexibility to experiment without drilling tons&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-annoying-but-does-the-job">Very annoying but does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stands have a bit of a wobble at max height, and the vibration coming off of my base station is causing something inside to rattle. Very annoying but does the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well with the HTC Vive lighthouses.</p>
