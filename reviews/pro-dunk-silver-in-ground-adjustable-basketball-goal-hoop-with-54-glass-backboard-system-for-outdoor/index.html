<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny">Worth every penny!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely great. Install was excellent and began one day after the product arrived. Heavy duty with think rust repelling paint. My son played for hours on it when finished. Installers were great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-this-hoop-is-awesome-lowers-far-enough-that-my-4-year-old">but this hoop is awesome - lowers far enough that my 4 year old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I rarely leave reviews, but this hoop is awesome - lowers far enough that my 4 year old, my 5 year old, my 7 year old, and all of the neighbor kids play basketball almost every evening after school in my driveway&hellip;all that can reach dunk and hang off the rim&hellip;AND&hellip;I got extremely lucky, because the vendor is the same town as me, and they performed a flawless install&hellip;MY BOYS LOVE IT!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-family-fun-so-far">Great family fun so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had the system for a week. Great family fun so far. Installation was expertly done</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="be-warned-not-a-safe-hoop">Be Warned - Not a Safe Hoop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the third time I&rsquo;ve written this review. Pro Dunk keeps deleting their products and reposting as different items with &ldquo;new&rdquo; 5 star reviews.When I opened the box, there was rust spots all over this goal. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I&rsquo;m paying thousands of dollars for a product that&rsquo;s to be used outdoors, it shouldn&rsquo;t come NEW with RUST!!!!!!! See pictures for proof&hellip;Pro Dunk customer service has not been any help in trying to make this right - they want me to pay shipping both ways for a replacement goal.Third, I tried to post a honest review on Pro Dunk and the review was never posted.There are also some safety issues that I have come across with this system - such as the protruding screws as seen in the photos.I am writing this review in hopes that the next consumer makes a better purchase than I did - see the quality issues in the attached pictures&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-product-that-is-easy-to-install">Great quality product that is easy to install!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great hoop. It&rsquo;s solid as a rock and doesn&rsquo;t move around or vibrate after taking a shot. The quality of the product is exceptional. The assembly of the system is very easy as long as you read through the directions and follow the steps precisely. Nothing is left out. We had an issue where the height adjustment part broke and would not move the backboard up or down. I called customer service and they asked me for some pictures to verify I wasn&rsquo;t missing anything. They then shipped out a replacement part free of charge. Those directions to reinstall that part were very precise and made installation really easy. Things do go wrong with products but the measure of a company is when they stand behind their product and you actually speak with a live human being. If/when I expand our basketball court, I will buy another ProDunkHoop product! You will not be disappointed with this product! Delivery of the product was simple. I was contacted by the shipping company to make sure someone was home when it was delivered. These extra details show the diligence of making sure the product gets to its destination in pristine condition! Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-buy-it">Just Buy It!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Silver Pro Dunk Hoop system is a Slam-Dunk! This product is crafted with high grade steel which helps minimize the shake of the backboard. In my opinion, similar priced hoop systems sold at your local sporting goods store are not constructed of the same quality materials. The Silver Pro Dunk Hoop system was very easy to install. After installing the base plate in concrete, the remaining install moves quickly and can be done with two people. However, you will absolutely need four adults to install the backboard. The online instructional video is also a great resource to reference if you have any questions. The materials were shipped fast and the delivery company off-loaded the system from the truck into my garage. This was an added bonus because some delivery companies will not off-load the shipment or the service is an added fee.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beyond-what-i-expected">Beyond What I Expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the new hoop. The quality is as good or better than expected and the installation was easy. I really like the stainless hardware. But beyond that, what really impressed me is that I ordered this from the company website on a weekend and had it the next week. I don&rsquo;t know if that was just timing on my part or if they are always that fast. Local big box stores could not get me a competitor&rsquo;s hoop even half that fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-long-as-you-follow-the-instructions-the-system-is-easy-to-put-together-and-concrete-into-the-ground">As long as you follow the instructions the system is easy to put together and concrete into the ground</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have had the Pro Dunk Hoops Silver system now for about 7 months and so far it has met all my expectations. I have also moved from the original residence of where the goal was installed and moved it to my new location. Only thing I had to do was order a new anchor system for new residence. As long as you follow the instructions the system is easy to put together and concrete into the ground. I did have to by new rebar when I moved but no big deal. The system came apart just as easy as it went together and is now in its new location. The silver system is perfect for the use it gets in my family. I have a 18x36 driveway and it is perfect. As I said before it is easy to install and is very sturdy. My son is 6&rsquo;4 240lbs and dunks on it and the goal stands up to the challenge. Also it is easy to lower so my 6yr old can play as well. Cant say enough about the system so far and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a basketball goal that will stand the test of time and take hard play with no problems as well. I would recommend this to a friend</p>
