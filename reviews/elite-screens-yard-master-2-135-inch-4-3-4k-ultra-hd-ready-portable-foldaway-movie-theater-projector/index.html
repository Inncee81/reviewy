<h5 id="once-this-arrived-it-was-easy-enough-to-set-up-and-i-found-that">Once this arrived it was easy enough to set up - and I found that &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>120 inch front version.Already have a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; high-end wall mount - but needed something portable (primarily for indoor use in various locations where I don&rsquo;t want to have a permanent installation).Was a bit concerned about the folded screen comments and the expectation of creases. Once this arrived it was easy enough to set up - and I found that while there are creases in the screen, they are very light and uniform (as the screen was folded extremely well) and are only vaguely noticeable when whitespace is projected&hellip; and after a few days even less so. As someone who is picky when it comes to creases in a screen, I&rsquo;m happy to say it&rsquo;s a non-issue for me w/this product.The one piece frame concept is really cool, though did notice there is a VERY MINOR curvature or &ldquo;sag&rdquo; of the top bar once assembled - but again not enough to be an issue for me (and yes this type of stuff typically bothers me), so that&rsquo;s how minor it is - and doesn&rsquo;t impact the screen tension in any way from what I can see. Screen itself snaps on fairly easily, was able to set it up myself though a second person would have been nice.The screen material is not quite as good as my permanent wall mount (which was over $1k) - but I would say it&rsquo;s very decent for the price and better than many of the screens I&rsquo;ve had in the past.For indoor use, can be placed against a wall and only fold the front legs out if that&rsquo;s how you want to elevate it - though in my case I created hidden wall mounts in the locations I plan to use it, so I can just carry it over and use the mounts, no need for the legs. Did try it with the legs attached though, and it fit nicely in the basement @ 88 inch ceiling height.Nice packaging, and overall the product has a quality feel to it - moreso than I expected. I would give it <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> if it cost $300+, but at this price point I really think it&rsquo;s a 9+. Can&rsquo;t really go wrong with this.</p>

<h5 id="great-movie-screen">Great movie screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is awesome. It is huge and takes up the whole room and it is not fully assembled, as I have low ceilings in the den. Feels like you are in the theater when viewing on this. Not sure why some are complaining about wrinkles/fold lines. When you snap this onto the frame they stretch and smooth out. It does not affect the quality of the movie and you would have to be standing right in front and on top of the screen to even detect where they are. I have only used this indoors so far due to the weather, but cannot wait to have a real outdoor movie night. I am also looking forward to taking it on camping trips. It is great that I do not need another power supply to blow up a screen, this comes in a carrying case which may be a bit bulky and a tad heavy (but I&rsquo;ll manage) . My husband has set it up and taken it down by himself with no problem, I expect the same. You get what you pay for and this is a real quality product. The screen framework is sturdy and the screen is not cheap vinyl.</p>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-so-easy-to-put-up-and-tear-down-it-s-not-even">This thing is so easy to put up and tear down it&rsquo;s not even &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is so easy to put up and tear down it&rsquo;s not even funny. If you can fold and unfold an umbrella, you can assemble and disassemble this. In fact, snapping buttons together from the screen to the frame is probably what takes the longest. But even that is only about 3 minutes. The screen itself is very high quality. When folded, there are creases that appear, but on a warm day they disappear after a few minutes in the sun after you set it up. The frame itself is very light and easy to manipulate. It&rsquo;s sturdy enough to stand on it&rsquo;s own if there&rsquo;s no wind. When there is wind, we just place something heavy on the legs, like pavers blocks or plastic weights. It also comes with a convenient carry/storage bag. Which when all bundled up, is light enough to carry with one hand, and small enough to store in a closet. It is a little pricey, there are cheaper options which I explored. But I&rsquo;m happy I went with this both for quality of viewing and convenience of setting up and tearing down.</p>

<h5 id="you-can-see-it-from-space">You can see it from space!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen frame is so lite, decided to hang up this bad boy on the wall and now I&rsquo;m rocking the &ldquo;movie theater screen&rdquo; in-house. Then when I wany, I just lift up, put the screen on its legs, and now we&rsquo;re going for a stroll through the neighboorhood&hellip;Boom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-creases-on-screen">Small Creases On Screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a 4K projector yet but I wanted to future proof my screen purchase. It comes in a nice carrying case for easy portability. I&rsquo;ve used this both indoors and out and it performed great. It also comes with stakes and even a rope for outdoor use even on windy days. The setup was painless, I used two people but even 1 person could do it. The frame is one piece and just unfolds into a 100&rdquo; rectangle. Then you just slide on both feet which lock into place.The only reason I knocked off a star is because the screen has a few creases on it. The screen snaps into place on the frame and gets very taught so I&rsquo;m hoping over time they disappear. I don&rsquo;t keep this setup at all times though so not sure how to get the wrinkles out. Maybe if the screen came rolled up instead of folded it may have eliminated creases. Other than that I&rsquo;m really happy with the performance, the included hardware, and ease of setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-outdoors">Great for Outdoors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I made this purchase several months ago but I wanted to use it several times before I made a review. It arrived as promised and it was very well packaged. It was easy to set up, even if it&rsquo;s only one person doing it. The instructions are simple and great. During the first several times you use it, you do notice several of the creases where it had been folded when the movie your watching is very lit but it&rsquo;s not noticeable when the movie is dark. It&rsquo;s not bad, I just noticed it a bit. It goes away after several uses. We rolled the screen up instead of folding it back the way it originally came. We used it in our backyard. It&rsquo;s a great purchase. I feel it&rsquo;s well made. The case it comes with holds everything in its place and seems durable. We hope to use it a lot more in the summer.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>The best screen for outside I ever seen.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Beautifully made, easy to put up and take down &hellip;..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>we are using it like the old times movie theaters! we just can&rsquo;t live without it anymore!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-we-expected">Just what we expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is just what we were looking for. We use this at our church/school and like it for its portability. It is light and sets up quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stand for the screen is amazing. It&rsquo;s like a big boys transformer toy that fold out of a small bag in comparison to how large the stand it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen">Great screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great screen! Easy to set up with 2 people. Movie nights are going to be so awesome! I have a mid-range projector. Photos are from a standard def dvd.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-portable-screen">Great portable screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for me. Takes a little muscle to stretch out the screen to snap it on so be warned on that. But once put together, very easy to setup and take down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-4">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Compact when collapsed and easy to assemble. Quick set up.</p>
