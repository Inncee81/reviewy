<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="awesome-product-awesome-price">Awesome Product! Awesome Price :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>O.K. boys and girls. This is my honest opinion of this very fine product.I have been to a lot of my friends houses and it seems that they all have some sort of small bluetooth speaker ranging in prices from $40 bucks up to $200 bucks. In comparison, I love what I got for such a good price. For one thing when compared to the $40 dollar speaker, the Amazon Basics seem to have more bass and the $40 dollar speaker didn&rsquo;t have the ability to answer a cell phone. When compared to the $120 dollar speakers, I&rsquo;d have to say they sound about the same for half the price. They both had speaker phone capabilities. The $200 dollar speaker did sound better and had more bass but the Amazon Basics is half the price, and, it is a lot more smaller and is more easy to move around from location to location in my book bag. It paired with ease to my iPhone and my computer. The buttons are good sized and placed well for me. It feels very solid in hand. Not a brick with large magnets on the speakers. Just solid like it won&rsquo;t fall apart. I ran several types of music through it. Some with a lot of bass and at full volume on both my iPhone and the speaker. It did not distort the music at all for me. It seemed like the manufacture capped the volume so it would sound clean at full volume. Also, at full volume on both my iPhone and the speaker, there was no noticeable sound or his when the music was not playing. Nice and quiet. All this testing was done with the charge that came with the speaker out of the box. All in all I love it. The packaging that the speaker came in is very nice too. Easy to open and yet protects nicely.Now for what I don&rsquo;t like.Amazon! Why put out a awesome product and then drop the ball by only giving you a USB charging cable that is only 20&rdquo; inches long? Seems to short for me to charge it from the most usual places. I have a AC/USB adapter that I can use but this short cord wont reach it from my desk. How many people have there computer on the floor? While charging, would you want to use the speaker down there? Now I have to purchase a longer cable and toss this one in the junk pile. Nothing big but it would have been nice for it to come with a standard sized cable.Why not add a AC/USB adapter? Would have been nice but not needed for me.Now just a pet peeve of mine.It would have been nice to have a stereo jack out so you can daisy-chain a few of these speakers together for a larger get together.Other than the USB cable, it is a very good speaker for its size with good sound that I think anyone would love without spending a lot of cash! I&rsquo;ll update this review about the battery life once I have had some more time using it.Hope this review helps someone with there decision.***One more suggestion Amazon. Design a inexpensive travel case so it won&rsquo;t get scratched up in my book bag.- Quick Update 01-18-14 - I decided to take it apart to find out what was inside and how it was made.Both the screens were inserted with a rubberized glue around the edges to hold them in and keep them from vibrating and making noises. The inside of the speaker box along with the wires and electronics are all lined with a foam material. The box is sealed! Where the plastic plate that holds the speakers in and attaches to the speaker box, it is screwed in and looks to be glued or hot glued to keep it air tight. The rest of my observations are from what I could see through the speaker openings after I took out the speakers. The speakers are of good make. Not the best but good. I don&rsquo;t think that the rear sub is an actual sub. From what I could see, nothing was hooked up to it. No metal frame and no magnet or wires. There was no visible battery but it may be housed in one of the switch housings. All in all it looks like it was very nicely made and not just cheeply thrown together. I like what I did see. I&rsquo;ll try to post some pics if I can.- Update 01-25-14 - After a week in the office of use for up to 8 hours per day with the our digital printers running, I can safely say that the volume for such a small speaker is very good. I did get a little distortion at full volume from the bass on a few songs but I never seem to run it at full volume all that much. Yes. I have to agree with others that the sound is a little muddy but I believe that if it wasn&rsquo;t, the bass sound wouldn&rsquo;t be as good. Seems like a compromise to me that I don&rsquo;t mind. I do like the sound. Several times I did have a phone call while out at the machines and I was able to receive the call, talk and hang up with no problem. I asked the caller how I sounded and they all told me fine. There was no echo like you sometimes get on Skype. Several employees that I work with came in and listened and they liked it too. Two of them stated that they were going to order one too.My printers were 17&rsquo; and 25&rsquo; away from my desk where my cell phone was. There is one wall that the signal had to pass through and I had no dropouts in the music and phone calls.All in all it is a $60.00 dollar bluetooth speaker that does what it supposed to do and does it well. You shouldn&rsquo;t expect it to sound like a larger, more expensive system but I am very impressed with what I got.One more note. The battery lasts for a long time. I charged it every other day with my workstations USB port and in about 4 hours it was done. That was while I was still using it at the same time.Enjoy and have fun with your new bluetooth speaker :-)I love mine.</p>

<h5 id="best-bang-for-your-buck">Best bang for your buck?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some other more expensive bluetooth speakers such as the Jambox. I like the jambox actually, i think it sounds good and has decent volume. I ordered the Photive CYREN but returned it because it sounded terrible to me. And i&rsquo;m sure it work working fine, it was just a really disappointing sound.So i took a chance on this because it seemed like a strange product for Amazon to be making and there are so many other options out there, why would they get into this space and risk their reputation unless they had something that was a great value? Bingo! I feel like if this was marketed by another company this would be roughly a $100 product. At $60 i think this is a steal. I don&rsquo;t feel like I want the Jambox anymore.As far as the sound goes, its all pretty subjective, but to my ear, its pretty well balanced. It doesn&rsquo;t kick out the same bass that the jambox does, but the bass does sound a bit tighter and more true to the source. The highs are VERY crisp if you are listening on-axis to the speaker. It won&rsquo;t get as loud as the jambox, however it seems like maybe they capped it where they did to avoid distortion. I don&rsquo;t think i need this to be a lot louder but i could see some others complaining.Anyway, i would recommend this to pretty much anyone.</p>

<p>I highly suggest that anyone who owns an echo dot get one of these! It&rsquo;s like day and night because it sounds so good! Trust me you&rsquo;ll be Glad that you did. You&rsquo;ll finally hear everything you&rsquo;ve been missing!</p>

<h5 id="amazon-basics-bluetooth-speaker-works-well">Amazon Basics Bluetooth speaker works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical at first that a $30 Bluetooth speaker could deliver quality sound and have the working features stated. The sound quality is as good as an Altec Lansing speaker which cost more than $100. I am impressed with the sound and features. I would not only recommend this to others, but am going to purchase another Amazon Basics Bluetooth speaker.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-speaker-perfect-for-traveling">Great little speaker - perfect for traveling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Read the other reviews and gave this speaker a try. Arrived quickly (thank you Amazon) and hooked up once I gave it a quick charge. I am running an iPhone 7 Plus and the sound quality is excellent. iOS 10.2 shows a headphone icon and a battery indicator for the speaker on the display. The speakers are a little on the small side - not much bass, but the highs and mids are clear. Pretty good Bluetooth range and works great with Pandora. I travel for business and this fits perfectly in my carry on.Give it a try - for the money you will be very pleased.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve bought 2 of these, only because I lost my first one. For the price you pay, they are amazing. They don&rsquo;t have a lot of bass like some of the other bluetooth speakers, but thats fine. Would recommend. And I have recommended.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-expected">Better than expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first the product was good but it didn&rsquo;t last long.. The quality started to die and began to make fuzzy noises. Also, it would turn on and off on its own. It still works but can be bothersome and I would recommend looking into another pair of speakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a lot from such a cheap speaker, but I&rsquo;ve been consistently impressed. It has a VERY decent bass kick to it with no distortion/fuzziness and excellent sound quality for such a small soundbar. The only thing I can think of is that it isn&rsquo;t SUPER loud, but it doesn&rsquo;t really need to be in a small room (mine lives in the bathroom). It&rsquo;s super portable, neat but unobtrusive in look and about the size of a tallboy aluminum drink can. I listen to a lot of rap on this speaker, and I&rsquo;m always very happy about the quality of sound that I get from it. Even if this one dies on me, I&rsquo;ll get another one.</p>
