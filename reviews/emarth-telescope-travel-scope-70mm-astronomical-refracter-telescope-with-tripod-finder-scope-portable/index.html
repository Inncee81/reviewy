<h5 id="portable-easy-to-set-up-great-instructions-and-manual">Portable, easy to set up, great instructions and manual!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome for beginners and its so small! This telescope was easy to put together and set up. The information packet/instructions is helpful and educational. I cant remember the last time I learned something from and instruction booklet. The booklet describes how the mirrors work and how to use the lenses. In addition to the instructions there is also a map of the moon!I knew the telescope would be small but this one is super tiny! I do have to use a chair outside because I cant bend down that far. The whole assembly folds up and will fit in the carry bag. The bag is light and thin but it will be great for keeping dust off the lenses and mirrors. The lenses are very clear and I was able to locate a few stars on my first night. Cant wait to get a good look at the moon and maybe mars! I would definitely recommend this as a great family activity of for anyone who is interested at a closer look at the moon and stars.</p>

<h5 id="emarth-travel-telescope-with-tripod-finder-scope">Emarth Travel Telescope with Tripod &amp; Finder Scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this Emarth Telescope as a gift for my nephew and niece. It&rsquo;s light and compact in size so it works pretty well with toddlers, preschool, and older kids. This telescope does require some assembly before it can be used and it&rsquo;s best to be done by adults because kids might touch and make the lens parts dirty. I think the design is pretty clever as there is a fold-able carrying bag included in the package and everything can be fit inside the bag when not used.The telescope comes with a viewfinder scope alone with the main objective lens. Two eye-pieces are included and one is 25mm while the other is 6mm (25mm offers 14.4x and 6mm offers 60x). There is a 3x Barlow lens which can further increase the magnification when needed. The viewfinder scope should be calibrated first with a closer object - align the viewfinder scope by tightening the adjustment screws around the mount. One the viewfinder scope is calibrated and the same object are observed through the viewfinder scope and main lens, we can proceed to observe other subjects, such as moon. A compact tripod is included in the package to enhance stability on most surfaces and the pan handle helps to lock the telescope in certain angle.** Pay attention to kids when they&rsquo;re using the telescope so they won&rsquo;t look directly into the sun as this might damage their eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-for-starters-and-hours-of-fun-with-the-kids">Great product for starters&hellip; and hours of fun with the kids.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first time purchasing a telescope. I wanted something simple and lightweight, and also powerful enough to observe the planetary bodies. The setup was suuuper fast - it worked right out of the box. The instructions were very simple and easy to understand (actually didn&rsquo;t even need them). First night, we could see Jupiter and its moons&hellip; it was very exciting for the whole family. We saw the rings on Saturn as well&hellip; amazing. The images were crisp. Can&rsquo;t wait for the moon to be visible in our area. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the barlow lense was missing, otherwise a 5-star product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-on-the-go">Great for on the go</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great starter telescope, or for anyone that travels or hikes to locations to view. Set up was really easy. It&rsquo;s very sturdy, has a viewing scope, and two different lens. The backpack is perfect for this, it&rsquo;s very lightweight and the telescope fits great in there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first telescope I&rsquo;ve ever purchased. I got it for my 5-year-old and he loves it too. Super easy assembly and alignment, and the first night we were looking at the moon and different stars. Easy to use and a great family activity. Can&rsquo;t wait to see what this thing can really do as I get more experienced.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-work">NOT WORK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed because it was a gift it was very embarrassing when informed it did not worked.Cannot view anything through the main viewer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-telescope-is-not-good">This telescope is not good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This telescope is not good! Point it at the sky and adjust it and you can&rsquo;t see anything. Can barely see the moon!</p>
