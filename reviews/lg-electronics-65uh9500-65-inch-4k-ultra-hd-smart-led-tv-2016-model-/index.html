<h5 id="lg-s-best-model-is-not-this-one-but-the">LG&rsquo;s best model is not this one but the&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finally was able to get ahold of the UH9500 where I work so I can test out the best 4K LED from LG. My store for the past several years has always carried the best of Samsung, but never LG besides their OLED. However, a customer did an in store and when it came in they cancelled so I actually got one in stock which the manager let me open and display.So I&rsquo;ll start off by saying this TV is very thin compared to their step below UH8500, but what I wanted to do was test to see if their was any improvements over the UH8500 and is it worth upgrading to the bigger model. The UH9500 is only in two sizes, the 65&rdquo; and 86&rdquo; while the UH8500 comes in 55&rdquo; 60&rdquo; 65&rdquo; and 75&rdquo;. So really, this is only for those who are debating for which 65&rdquo; they should get.The picture quality is almost identical, with the UH8500 giving a little better black level and uniformity. The UH9500 has more noticeable clouding and this is due to it having three IPS screens while the UH8500 only has two.The contrast levels are also the same, both being average and this is once again because of the IPS screens. IPS panels and VA panels each have their own positive and negative qualities. IPS panels give you a much wider viewing area, so for those who have a large living room and seating area would like LG models as they allow people to sit off angle to the TV and still see a great picture. However, due to having multiple screens it requires more light power which causes poor black levels so those who watch movies in the dark may not like it. If LG would do full array local dimming I feel they would have this in the bag. But sadly, TV manufacturers seem to think people want extremely thin TVs so they&rsquo;ve continued the tradition with edge lit local dimming. Which don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Edge Lit Local Dimming is still better than not having it however we all know they could have done better and people would have paid more for that kind of technology in their TV. VA panels, like Samsung offer deeper black levels with a higher contrast level which for people, day or night would appreciate the picture. However, once you start moving off to the side you lose picture quality and the more off to the side the faster it deteriorates. So for large living rooms and wider viewing areas may not like Samsung models.The color depth and banding of the UH9500 is better than the UH8500 but only slightly, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s worth paying more for the 65UH9500 over the 65UH8500 as most wouldn&rsquo;t notice this.The UH8500 has a better 3D picture, I noticed on the UH9500 that there was a little cross talk when test this feature out where the UH8500 I didn&rsquo;t have this issue with and was almost nonexistent.The motion blur on the UH9500 is better than average, however isn&rsquo;t as great as the UH8500 and is actually noticeable worse because when I set these models side by side I could tell see the faint trail behind fast objects.The UH8500 is also better at Judder-Free support. This is another thing that needs to be said as well, and this is a feature that no one ever seems to look at when buying a TV and that&rsquo;s Judder-Free 24p support. Movies play a certain frame rates, Blu Rays and DVD&rsquo;s play at 24fps, streaming movies like from Netflix play at 60p and movies from cable are 60i. This has been a thing that has always been over looked with most people, and that is does that TV support these frame rates. Samsung&rsquo;s 2016 models K6250 all the way through KU7500 doesn&rsquo;t support ANY of these frame rates. This means that regardless of what&rsquo;s playing, there will be a slight judder. It&rsquo;s mostly noticeable with slow panning shots, and to be honest most people don&rsquo;t notice it all. This is one of the reasons why Motion Interpolation is included with LED&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s because with that Soap Opera Effect on, it hides the judder so they could cut corners with internal features. Samsung isn&rsquo;t the only brand that does this, Sony, LG, Vizio and many more do the same thing, and it&rsquo;s annoying and a trend that&rsquo;s slowly starting to change.So the UH8500 supports Judder-Free playback with 24p (Blu Ray and DVD&rsquo;s) and 60i which is cable movies. It doesn&rsquo;t however support 60p which is streaming. I&rsquo;m a little confused by this, as most people would agree that most people stream their content and watch from physical copies of their movies. So I really think if LG wasn&rsquo;t going to support a signal in their models, it would be 60i as most people are slowly cutting cable out of their lives.The UH9500 on the other hand, only supports 24p playback. So movies from cable and streaming will play with a slight judder. I was a little surprised actually that their best model would drop 60i playback. I would have assumed it would either improve over the UH8500 and support all, or be exactly the same. It&rsquo;s possible that in the future they will release an update that will fix this. LG did this in the past with their 2015 OLED to support 60i, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they did the same for this model.The judder isn&rsquo;t really noticeable if you aren&rsquo;t sensitive to it, I am and I can tell you I hate it. You can normally play in the Auto Motion settings, and under custom you can slide the De-Judder bar a little higher and set the De-Blur bar really low and this should hide the judder while not showing the Soap Opera Effect. Lucky for me, I actually don&rsquo;t notice the Soap Opera Effect and like it.The LG UH9500 is a pretty good model, but for those who are looking at getting a 65&rdquo; it&rsquo;s really hard to convince someone in getting the UH9500 when it&rsquo;s little brother the UH8500 offers the same picture, feature and is better at motion and 3D. So if you are debating between these two models, the UH8500 is a much better get, and will save you money which you can use to get a 4K Blu Ray Player and get the most out of your new 4K TV.The Samsung KS8000 will also be an amazing choice and is actually the one I recommend to most people. It offers a much better picture quality, deep black levels and much better peak brightness. The only negative I have is no 3D, and the picture will deteriorate from the side. So if you have a large seating area the UH8500/UH9500 would probably be a better choice. However, I would still strongly consider you to take a look at the KS8000 before you pull the trigger.The Sony X930D, like the KS8000 will also give you a great picture and deeper black levels than the Samsung KS8000. However, like the Samsung it will deteriorate from the side. The Sony X930D also offers 3D but it&rsquo;s not Passive 3D but active so it&rsquo;s a different technology and can&rsquo;t compete with LG in this department.The LG B6 OLED is different in technology, much different and is a million times better in every way. This fetches a higher price tag than what some wanted to spend, however its black levels is amazing, contrast is amazing and HDR performance is improved as well as motion. If you have the money, and want the very best picture then OLED is where it&rsquo;s at.</p>

<h5 id="pleased-with-the-purchase">Pleased with the purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this set because of its 10 bit display and ability to accept both HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR formats. The set produces a great picture with currently available HD signals and does a decent job upscaling non HD signals. The smart platform is very good and coupled with the magic remote is easy to use. The more familiar I become with this set and adjustments, the more pleased I am with the purchase. I struggled with the decision to spend several hundred dollars more for this set than its cousin, the 65UH8500, which has an 8 bit display but is otherwise technically equal. Additionally, I preferred the style of the 65UH9500.</p>

<h5 id="lg-65uh9500-performs-well-is-fully-equipped">LG 65UH9500 Performs Well, is Fully Equipped</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I give the 65UH9500 a five stars. While it is not an OLED, nor does it have a full array lighted display, it has a beautiful picture. It is packed with great features and performs very well for an edge lighted LED UHDTV. The frame and base are attractive, sturdy and provides a nice appearance. The witch of the screen is amazingly thin.The UHDTV was delivered by a 3rd party through Amazon.com. I ensured that the unpacking and handling was completed as shown on the outside of the box that it was packed in (bad experience with the 3rd party unpacking and handling of the replaced 65UH8500, that may have contributed to severe grabbing and squeezing of the top of the screen when unpacking and handling).Once the power was applied, and the DVR and disc player were HDMI connected, from that point of powering it on to viewing live TV was easy by following the on-screen setup process.I manually programmed all the available settings to my liking. Having read all the reviews for the UH8500 and UH9500 there is lots of ideas for the best settings, however I found that most of those are for individual taste so it took me around 30 minutes to get the settings to my liking.This UHD TV supports HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color for 4K@60HZ where devices have v 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0. Each input is manually set from the General Settings option. I love the wide angle of viewing with the IPS display. With our past Samsung HDTV&rsquo;s the viewing angle were very narrow to where the picture would whiteout when wanting to move to a wider viewing angle.For those that have limited channel local over the air channels, if you have high speed internet, you get the bonus of being able to enable Channel Plus. This feature gives the advantage of watching Live HD streaming of TV channels with a good variety of genre.The passive 3D is outstanding and works well at viewing level even at greater horizontal angles. My family and friends (like me) are blown away by the fact that objects come right out to you where you want to reach up and touch them!WebOS 3.0 Smart TV in conjunction with the magic remote control is excellent, robust and is so easy use, plus it is a snap when changing inputs or when selecting various Apps.We subscribe to Netflix. They provide the Ultra HD 4K viewing experience. While it gobbles up more broadband, the picture quality is outstanding and the colors are so vibrant. There are more colors seen that are not seen with regular HD viewing. Amazing!Nitpicking:This 65UH9500 replaced a 65UH8500. I returned the 65UH8500 as defective because of major vertical banding that was seen with certain light colors and grays when there is horizontal movement. These bands were wide and faded ever so slowly. The 65UH9500 has vertical banding but it is slight as compared to the 8500. So slight it is tolerable, in that when bands appear they are very light and dissipate rapidly (which makes me believe that the UH9500 has a faster processor than the UH8500), plus it was properly handled when unpacked, unlike the UH8500. Instead of fixating on the bands that were so predominate with the 8500, I no longer notice the fixation in gone. I have high end Samsung HDTV’s. In comparison the Samsungs have some vertical banding. I am of the opinion that IPS Panels are more prone to banding and with edge lighting, it is next to impossible to avoid.Respective to video, I have ample contrast between blacks and whites. Night viewing, blacks are less dark but again it is because of the edge lighting. I found that by having the LED Local Dimming set to high makes the blacks very black but when bright objects appear and move, there is obvious increase in brightness in the blacks, no worse than on any of my Samsung’s. Also as compared to my VIZIO 4K HDTV with full array back lighting, it suffers very similar lighting issues but in smaller areas. All I can say if these things that other reviewers report are bothersome to you, it may be worth your while to spend the extra money and go with the OLED&rsquo;s.</p>
