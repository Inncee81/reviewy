<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="battery-hog">Battery Hog</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We originally purchased wireless mouses for our department 5 years ago which everyone was happy with. However my wireless mouse started consuming batteries faster and faster as time went on. This mouse was purchased as a replacement because it boasts a 30 month battery life. WRONG!!!! I got about 5 months out of the first set of batteries and thought maybe it was because they were the non-name-brand batteries that ship with small electronics, that does not seem to be the case. Now that the mouse is about a year old, I am lucky to get two months out of a set of batteries with this mouse and normally have to replace them after 3-5 weeks. I have tried turning the mouse off each afternoon, three different mouse pads, and several different brands of batteries; none of that seems to make a difference. The rest of my department is still using the older mouses and replace the batteries once or twice per year&hellip;..guess I&rsquo;m going mouse shopping again. I am very disappointed in this HP product as the HP mouse I use at home has been phenomenal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-that-the-dongle-pairs-with-my-kb">I like that the dongle pairs with my kb</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK. I needed a cheap mouse quickly. I like that the dongle pairs with my kb. One complaint (and I have gone through the mouse settings) is that the left click is off. I have mouse settings for single click, and this very often requires multiple attempts before it works. Another complaint is that it tends to click when not intended. Anyway strange things have been happening since I started using it. Nothing really bad. Links get moved in Firefox when I didn&rsquo;t move them, for example.I have used the HP Elite kb and mouse combo for years and may have to scrape up the dough to buy that again, if this thing gets too annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-great">Nothing Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just OK. The wheel is very stiff to use. Fits hand well (I have an average size hand). Somewhat confusing about removing and replacing batteries no instruction, so you have to figure it out by yourself (not hard just confusing). The worst thing about this product is the packaging - be warned, have several knifes hand and watch yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buttons-are-stiff">Buttons are stiff.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for bluetooth so I wouldn&rsquo;t have a dongle hanging out of my laptop. This was very inexpensive, so I decided to give it a try.I&rsquo;m very picky when it comes to mice. When I find a mouse I like, I usually buy a few so I have spares. Whenever I go to a store that has mice on display, I try them out. I couldn&rsquo;t do that with this mouse, but I decided to gamble anyway because I thought the mustache was amusing.Well, you win some, you lose some; in this case, the left, right, and wheel buttons are much stiffer than I would like, so I won&rsquo;t be buying any more of these. I use a mouse for many hours a day, almost every day. It&rsquo;s crucial that anything repetitive like clicking, be easy and smooth.It might not bother other people, but it&rsquo;s such a crucial part of the mouse experience that I have to knock off two stars for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazon-is-faster-and-more-responsive-than-microsoft">amazon is faster and more responsive than microsoft</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>tthis was perfect but my experience was tarnished because I had just ppurchased a keyboard with and mouse from Microsoft thsat was missing the little piece that allows you to connect with monitor. I had no folloup re satisfaction, like I get from amazon. I had no luck, after several hours of trying , to order a part, let them know I had issue. I tried chat, onsite and with phone. So I finally had to order this one from amazon, to get the chip. In two days I was up and computing! I still have the extra mouse of course. LOL</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="horrible-battery-life-and-crappy-scroll-wheel">Horrible battery life and crappy scroll wheel.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>7/6/17 - NOT HAPPY AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN! The scroll wheel has malfunctioned and is make the page skip/jump (pretty badly) when scrolling up and down. Also, the battery is now dying and I have used it for just about 1 year. This mouse is consistently left at my office, in a controlled temp environment, and only used there. If I could, I&rsquo;d rate this a 0. But Amazon will only allow me to change it to a 1.7/28/17 - I purchased this mouse because of its stylish look along with how long the battery is supposed to last, being that I use this for work. I was really disappointed due to the fact of how small and heavy it is. It&rsquo;s really uncomfortable to use on a daily basis. If you have a smaller hand, I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t be too bad.Giving it 3 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-wireless-hp-receiver-is-small-and-perfect">The wireless HP receiver is small and perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The wireless HP receiver is small and perfect! The travel-size mouse is great fit to my hand, and its scroll wheel has the right amount of texture for easy-of-use, and quiet operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mouse">Great mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Rediculously comfortable. For me, hand feel is really important when it comes to a mouse because if my fingers dont rest correctly, I end up pressing the buttons when I don&rsquo;t mean to. I don&rsquo;t know why there is such a huge descrepency in price for the different colors, but whatever. The color wasn&rsquo;t my first choice, but I wasnt going to pay $10 more for a different design. I agree with another reviewer that the wheel is a little stiff, but I honestly don&rsquo;t know if I would have picked up on this, had I not read that review. I think it depends on your intended use, because I aftually dislike wheels that move too freely. I dont use a mouse pad and it works fine. I use this mouse on both my windows laptop and mac interchangably with no set-up and no problem.Update&hellip;this mouse started skipping around and getting jumpy. I&rsquo;ve tried replacing batteries, using it on different surfaces to no avail. Extremely annoying. Would not repurchase.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well, but the front is a bit narrow for my hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>best mouse I ever bought</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>came fast and works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to set up , works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-mouse-and-inexpensive-too">Perfect mouse, and inexpensive too!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome mouse! Super comfortable, perfect size, long battery life, and it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to pair an HP keyboard with the same dongle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the Job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good little mouse &hellip;. does the job!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality mouse and the battery last 30 month</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-glitchy">Very Glitchy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it works fine but it seems like half the time it&rsquo;s out of control. Too frustration. I will be returning it. Sucks because I&rsquo;m usually please with HP products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-battery-life-linux-compatible">Excellent battery life, Linux compatible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse has run for months on one pair of regular Energizer AA batteries without turning it off or having to use the reconnect button. Works flawlessly with Linux Mint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-i-ve-only-had-this-less-than-a-month">So far so good, I&rsquo;ve only had this less than a month &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good, I&rsquo;ve only had this less than a month but it is working very well. I&rsquo;ll update my review if it fails in the next 6 months.</p>
