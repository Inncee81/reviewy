<h5 id="trail-tested-and-approved">Trail tested and approved!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was a little nervous to attach my cell phone to the mount on the motorcycle. The mount seems very durable but I was concerned about the durability of the shaft that connects the base clamp and the phone holder. I thought maybe this was the weak point. A lifetime warranty is great but if I lose my cell phone for a $9.00 mount the warranty doesnt mean anything. So I went for a test ride today on my dual sport motorcycle on a very rocky trail. The mount held incredibly well. The rubber band/strap that actually does much of the support of the phone did its job well and the mount itself held tight without issue to the handlebars. The compression nut that tightens the ball/swivel joint between the mounting base and actual phone holder seemed hard to tighten as tight as I thought it needed to be but it did great and did not allow the phone to bounce around to different positions. Overall I felt this was a great test of this mount and I have to say I am very happy with the results since this is probably the toughest terrain it will see with me and it passed perfectly. One other thing to say is that the handlebar clamp itself is very adjustable and had no issue clamping to my fat handlebars. It has 3 mounting options for varying diameters of bars plus a rubber insert to hold it nice and tight to any diameter..</p>

<h5 id="if-you-play-pokemon-go-you-need-one-of-these">If you Play Pokemon Go, you NEED one of these.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this phone mount to make playing Pokemon Go easier and it really worked. I tried carrying my phone in my pocket while I played but it just wasn&rsquo;t working for me when riding my bike. This phone mount great. The swivel head is handy for proper positioning while playing. The phone feels secure in the cradle.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-bikes-motorcycles-atv-s-etc">Great for Bikes, Motorcycles, ATV&rsquo;s, etc&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super easy to attach. I bought for my maxi scooter (Yamaha Majesty) and put it on the arm of the side mirror, and it works perfectly. This would work great for motorcycles, bicycles, ATV&rdquo;s, really anything that has an arm for attachment. Love it! They should have replacements of the rubber attachments for the phones for as time goes on having to stretch it. Pleased.I bought the orange one after this first review and boy I&rsquo;m very displeased. I paid 9.98 for the orange one and it&rsquo;s 7.98, same as the black. Also the orange one doesn&rsquo;t sync up in alignment with the stretch part that goes around the corners of the phone. The design of the part that holds the phone only pulls open on one side whereas the black one both sides stretch out. Horrible design flaw. If you need to buy one get the black one. The orange appears to be an update in design for holding the phone thats it, but if it doesn&rsquo;t line up then it&rsquo;s useless.As far as the prices for each phone, watch for they fluctuate by 2.00 more or less.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. I&rsquo;ve installed this on 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; bars on my Yamaha Stratoliner. I was nervous about the vibrations of the handlebars causing the phone to drop. There&rsquo;s definitely a sense of vulnerability trusting a $400+ phone to a $13 piece of plastic. But after riding a couple hundred miles in varying road conditions, all seems well. Will update later if anything changes.</p>

<h5 id="used-on-the-bike-stem">Used on the bike stem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this to replace my bulky old one and I wanted something with a bigger opening that I can use on my bike stem.- It fit perfectly- feeks solid and trustworthy- looks professional- perfect position in the middle of the handlebars- easy to install- I used it only with the rubber strap, just to be on the safe side - no rattling, no moving, love it :)Hope this helps :)</p>

<h5 id="no-warranty-no-response-for-broken-item-lifetime-warranty">NO WARRANTY / NO RESPONSE FOR BROKEN ITEM &hellip; Lifetime warranty???</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Phone mount worked as described, but a month of use has shown its effects.The mount locking to the handle bars is plastic and BROKE OFF.I have messaged about the &ldquo;LIFETIME WARRANTY&rdquo; to replace the item, but have gotten NO RESPONSE.If roam would respond to my messages and replace the item I would be satisfied,but instead I am left with a &ldquo;lifetime warranty&rdquo; item with NO LIFETIME WARRANTY!!!Roam Co-Pilot Universal Bike Phone Mount holder for Motorcycle / Bike Handlebars, iPhone 6/6s | 6/6s Plus | 5 | 5s | Galaxy S4/S5/S6 Edge | Note 5 | Holds phones To 4&rdquo;in. Wide, Lifetime Warranty.</p>

<h5 id="4-5">4.5☆</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 29in Ozone Bike. It fitted well with my handle bars. The small size of the box threw me off, but was surprised with the efficiency of the space. The product came well, I had seen the setup pictures beforehand posted by the supplier. That made setup easy. Installation took longer than expected but made it work. I follow many trails so I was excited that my phone kept intact while on the holder. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the &ldquo;swivel&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t stay quite upright all the time. Other than that, product surpassed expectations with price and quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-these-mounts-a-lot">I like these mounts a lot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like these mounts a lot. I added a piece of PVC pipe to my car to use them&hellip;Unfortunately, you can barely tell from the pic, but that&rsquo;s kind of a good thing about a&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-mount-but-wont-stay-upright-when-riding">Good mount but wont stay upright when riding</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Straps hold the phone well, with good grip to the handlebar, but the ball joint that allows the phone mount to swivel is weak and doesn&rsquo;t hold the phone upright.</p>

<p>looks great if it works as good as it looks I&rsquo;ll love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed</h5>

<p>Perfect. Fits perfectly on my motorcycle. The silicone webbing is offset a bit, which allows me to mount my phone off to the right slightly so I can see my indicator lights.</p>
