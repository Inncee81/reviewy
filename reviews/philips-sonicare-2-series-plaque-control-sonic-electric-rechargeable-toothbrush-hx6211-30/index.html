<h5 id="five-stars-highly-recommended">Five stars: Highly recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:Great price (I paid $40)One speed (this is a big plus for me)Excellent qualitySame 31,000 brush strokes per minute as other Sonicare electric brushes that cost twice as much2 years global warranty90 days money back guaranteeCharger included (100-240V AC, 50-60Hz)Easy-start feature (for those who are new to electric brushing)Quadpacer (during brushing it reminds you every 30 sec with a short beep and a pause)Smartimer (shuts off automatically after 2 minutes)Comes with NiMH battery (NiMH batteries have no memory). So you can leave it plugged in.You can buy this model in different colorsCons:Rudimentary battery level indicatorTakes up to 48 hours to charge from 0 to 100%Does not come with a travel caseDoes not have a Lithium batteryFinal thoughts :I have been using sonicare for many years. In my personal opinion Philips toothbrushes are far more superior than Oral-b when it comes to plaque removal. I highly recommend this unit over more expensive models beause it does the same good job at half the price. Also I like the fact that it has only one speed (unlike its expensive siblings where you can accidently change speed during brushing). So if your primary goal is to clean and remove plaque then you just need one speed.Don&rsquo;t hesitate buy it you will thank me later.</p>

<h5 id="after-5-months-cleans-well-but-brush-head-replacements-are-expensive-and-may-be-too-powerful-for-some">After 5 months: Cleans well, but brush head replacements are expensive and may be too powerful for some</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was surprised to see this Sonicare toothbrush under $40, and went ahead and bought it. Here&rsquo;s what I think after 5 months:Pros:* Seems to clean pretty well. Leaves teeth feeling shiny. Nice to have that fresh from the dentist feeling every morning.* My brother has what appears to be pretty much the same model for several years and it&rsquo;s still going, so durability is good.* My dental hygienist recommended it.* The included brush head is durable and lasts longer than 3 months, at least for me.* Comes with a coupon for $5 off replacement brush heads.Cons:* Replacement brush heads, even with the coupon, cost a lot. My brother got one of the cheaper knockoff replacement brush heads and I can see little strands of bristles hanging out. (not frayed, but almost falling out) So I&rsquo;m going to wait for a deal on the genuine ones.* The included brush head is pretty small in comparison to your average manual toothbrush, perhaps 60% of the size. You can buy bigger (and softer) ones. See photo which compares it to a Colgate 360 manual toothbrush.* The instructions say to brush for 2 minutes on the fronts and backs of your teeth, but neglect to mention the chewing surfaces - probably the most important part of your teeth to brush!* After a few uses, it changes from a &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; introductory mode to a more &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; mode. It is quite a bit more powerful, and I wish I could change it back. Even the gentle mode is too much for my girlfriend, who promptly said she&rsquo;s never going to use it, and will stick with her manual Colgate 360 brush.Tips:* You don&rsquo;t (and probably shouldn&rsquo;t) press down when brushing with this brush - it might harm your enamel. (and will wear out the head faster)* All Sonicares are basically the same unit, with fancier and possibly unnecessary features at the high end. The higher end ones are thinner and lighter though.Overall, recommended at this price. There&rsquo;s currently a $10-off coupon at Amazon, so you can get it for $29.95 now.</p>

<h5 id="great-toothbrush">Great toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dentist said my teeth were fabulous the last cleaning I had this month so I think it&rsquo;s doing the job. Delivered in timely manner, product was as advertised, lighter than our last sonicare which is nice &amp; came in a sturdy packed box. I would recommend &amp; buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-this">Buy this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sonicate always has quality products. We own 6 of these tooth brushes for us and all of our kids. I would and have bought again and again. The kids have to get used to them as the vibration can be intense. This one was for my 1 year old son and he loves the vibration while he&rsquo;s teething. I can&rsquo;t brush without mine because my teeth just don&rsquo;t seem as clean with a manual brush. Sonicare is so much better then other electric brands!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-as-always">Great as always</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great as always. This is my 3rd Sonicare I&rsquo;m 3 years. If you don&rsquo;t own one, you are missing out. If I travel and leave mine at home my teeth feel extremely dirty when trying to use a regular tooth brush. I am also 38 and have had only one cavity my whole life. I really think this brand has helped with my all around excellent dental hygiene. I wish I could give this product 10 stars,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-fresh-and-so-clean-clean">So fresh and so clean clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this tooth brush one day and love it. It does tickle your nose and cheeks, but it isn&rsquo;t over powering. This is my first electric brush (other than the battery spin brush for $5) and I&rsquo;m pretty amazed and the difference you can feel. It&rsquo;s the perfect handheld size. The brush &amp; stem isn&rsquo;t uncomfortable at all. The charging station looks to be waterproof, almost as if it wireless charges, but with a little &lsquo;nub&rsquo; to hold it in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brilliant-device-with-a-nifty-killer-app">Brilliant Device with a Nifty Killer App</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best thing ever! I should&rsquo;ve gotten this years ago. A normal mechanical toothbrush cannot compare to the oscillation speed of this, and a hand toothbrush feels downright unhygienic after using this. The best feature: an audible/&ldquo;feel-able&rdquo; 30-second interval warning. Every 30 seconds, the pitch of the motor raises for a split second - an absolutely ingenius feature that helps you pace yourself over the full 2-minute brushing session.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works well! Love it!</p>

<h5 id="the-best-brush-for-your-teeth">The best brush for your teeth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you care about your teeth, get this toothbrush. I had another brand and this device is significantly better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-disappointed">So disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this toothbrush after my old one of 8 years finally died. I&rsquo;m so disappointed. I skipped the easy start and went right to what I&rsquo;m used to&hellip;. or so I thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="phillips-sonicare">Phillips Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband enjoys his toothbrush very much. This new one is much quieter than his previous model. It also holds a charge longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-third-sonicare-they-do-eventually-stop-charging">This is third sonicare. They do eventually stop charging &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is third sonicare. They do eventually stop charging after a few years, but the price of the basic one is reasonable enough that it is worth it to replace it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-disappointed-in-this-one-compared-to-my-last-one">I&rsquo;m disappointed in this one compared to my last one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace a Philips electric toothbrush (different model) that wore out after 5 years. I&rsquo;m disappointed in this one compared to my last one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it-and-so-does-my-dentist-when-i">I love it. And so does my dentist when I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a sonicare for more than 20 years now and upgraded to this version. I love it. And so does my dentist when I have check-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="there-is-really-no-substitute-in-my-book">There is really no substitute in my book.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had my Sonicare Diamond clean for about 6 years, it finally finally bit the dust. I tried switching to one of those powered oral b types from the grocery store, it was awful, I&hellip;</p>
