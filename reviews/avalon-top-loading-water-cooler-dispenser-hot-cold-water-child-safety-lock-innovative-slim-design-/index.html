<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="top-loading-water-cooler">Top Loading water cooler</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 3rd home water cooler. After 2 weeks of heavy usage ( 2- 6 gallon containers) I would say this is an excellent product. The water flow is much faster than my previous Avanti Unit which recently broke down and started leaking. The temperature if much colder than my previous coolers and I am able to poor several large glasses of water without worry about them not being as cold as the previous poured glass. I am also able to stand under the spout larger mugs and tall glasses which I could not with my previous coolers without slanting them.The hot water has also been working very well. My wife and I drink tea often a night and we are both able to fill our large mugs with piping hot water.The unit does not have storage underneath for cups or tea bags. But I think it makes up for that by providing plenty of cold and hot water..I have read plenty of reviews on and off of Amazon before making this purchase due to the frustration of already burning through 2 other water coolers. I have not experienced any of the negatives as presented by other reviewers.</p>

<h5 id="died-in-8-months-do-not-buy-manufacturer-is-nonexistent">DIED IN 8 MONTHS! Do not buy! Manufacturer is nonexistent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why there are so many good reviews for this thing. It died in 8 months. I scoured the web trying to find any information about Avalon. Absolutely no luck what-so-ever. Amazon gave me a number to an Avalon in California who laughed when I called asking about water coolers. We also couldn&rsquo;t get a reply from &lsquo;ExcellentProductsInc,&rsquo; who we purchased the cooler from. I would not advise purchasing unless you only need a water cooler for 8 months. It seems many of the reviews are from people who got a deal on this thing. Save your money, buy something else.</p>

<h5 id="quietly-doing-it-s-job">Quietly doing it&rsquo;s job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a silent workhorse. You know that a product is good when it fades into the background of your environment and just works. This cooler silently works away to give you piping hot water on demand as well as some of the coldest water I&rsquo;ve had. The minimal footprint makes it a great addition to a small space while still giving you all the convenience of a larger machine. The safety switch on the hot water prevents little hands from getting scalded if used in a home or daycare. While the unit provides an anchor bracket on the back to fasten it to the floor, I found that the unit is solid enough to place on low pile carpet and still be quite sturdy. If you are looking for the most bang for your buck, this is the unit for you. And no&hellip;I was not paid or given a discount for this review. I just like giving a product the accolades it deserves if it earns it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fit-the-bill">Fit the bill</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This unit replaced an old GE unit that &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; to have begun leaking on us. In retrospect, it may have been more a cracked bottle cap issue that was letting air into the bottle allowing water to leak out. When we first got this unit, water &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; to leak from the unit as well. So I ordered some replacement bottle caps through eBay (what? Amazon doesn&rsquo;t carry any?), and that resolved the leakage issue. The unit works great though we don&rsquo;t use the cooling section, only the hot water section. It produces great hot water, sufficient for beverages and &ldquo;Cup Noodles&rdquo;. I prefer the top loading feature over the bottom loading as water flow isn&rsquo;t dependent on electricity in case of a power outage, nor are we tied to the pump flow rate or pump noise, a common complaint with bottom loading units. Since we don&rsquo;t have kids that we are concerned about getting burned with the hot water, I put clear packing tape over the &ldquo;safety&rdquo; button on the hot water control to hold it down and now have one handed operation. I couldn&rsquo;t do that with the GE unit’s twist safety feature. The unit is good for filling thinner containers with hot water (it’s hard to add water to medium to larger pans from the unit due to the proximity of the cool dispenser control). We have a very good under sink filter with a dedicated filtered water faucet and use that for cold drinking water and refilling the 5-gallon bottle for instant hot water. We opted not for an undersink instant hot water generator due to the higher cost, limited undersink space, installation process and higher risk of an accidental undersink leak (we had a very expensive house flood due to an accidental disconnect under that sink in the past). This unit fit the bill. From an esthetic perspective, it would be nice if they offered it also in a “stainless steel” paint version which would fit better in with our kitchen décor.</p>

<h5 id="died-fast-can-t-find-the-company-to-help">Died fast, can&rsquo;t find the company to help</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought in March, it died by September, blowing out the fuses as it did so. I cannot find customer service info for the company to see if it&rsquo;s covered.Nice aesthetically, but I guess it was my mistake to trust price &amp; reviews. Functioned great until it&rsquo;s early demise.<strong>Update February</strong>* - Amazon support led me to the manufacturer for assistance. They asked some questions and are sending out a replacement. I&rsquo;ve updated this review and rating to reflect the improvement.</p>

<h5 id="avalon-water-dispenser-beat-my-many-previous-water-dispensers">Avalon water dispenser beat my many previous water dispensers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is my first water dispenser from Avalon. I have purchases many water dispenser before and this one beat the previous water dispensers that I&rsquo;ve own. This is a top load and so the water bottle goes on the top rather from the bottle. I like the press-paddle design because it is much easier to get a cup of water. The one I have downstairs is a press button, which requires me to press down, and after 4 years of owning that water dispenser, the button occasionally gets stuck. When that happens I have to bang the side to get it from it stuck position.If you have little one, the child lock on the water dispenser is great. The press-paddle will not work alone if you want the hot water. You first have to press in the button and hold it in while pressing the paddle to get the hot water. I have check the temperature with my cooking thermometer and the cold water get to 47.8 degree F and the hot water is at 167 Degree F (super hot). With the cold water, it cold enough you don&rsquo;t need any ice. The hot water gets crazy hot and you can pretty much cooking ramen noddle, make tea, hot chocolate, and even coffee.*Received this product at a discounted price for an exchange for an honest review.</p>

<h5 id="tilted">Tilted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unit wants to tip forward a bit. Water bottle will not fit underneath pouring spouts. Will work , but not exceptional.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product and great service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-or-the-price">A++++ or the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THANK YOU AVALON, this product works VERY well, I no longer have to boil water for tea or french press, or use ice!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used to having well water. Moved and now have public water. I can&rsquo;t get used to taste. Purchased this and it solved the problem. I love having it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far it&rsquo;s working perfect!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-water-coolers-2-that-do-not-leak">Outstanding water coolers (2) that do NOT leak&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is long overdue. I purchased two of these coolers and after a year of heavy use BOTH of them are still operating flawlessly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish the cold water would be colder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-to-buy">NOT WORTH TO BUY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>AFTER 11 MONTH STARTS TO LEAKING FROM THE TOP. DO NOT BUY. IT&rsquo;S NOT WORTH TO BUY IN THIS KIND OF THE PRICE.</p>

<p>so far so good</p>
