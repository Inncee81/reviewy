<h5 id="as-perfect-utilitarian-as-a-tripod-can-be">As Perfect &amp; Utilitarian As A Tripod Can Be!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely LOVE this tripod. I have no clue how such a versatile tripod can go for so low&hellip;but hey just one more reason to LOVE Amazon.com!!As you can see I have no arms so I need a tripod that is lightweight but full on perks&hellip;this tripod is EVERYTHING I hoped for &amp; then some!!!!It is VERY easy to operate from manipulating the height to changing the swivel points for various angles. The knobs are nice &amp; big making screwing/unscrewing very easy &amp; effortless.I got this for my Makayama iPad case &amp; it works seamlessly with it.Great product! Great pricing!! Thanks Amazon!!!![&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="more-features-than-expected">More Features than Expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the money, this is a great product! For around $20, I was expecting a basic, low quality product to get me by. All it had to do was hold my camera (Nikon D5000) in place and I would have been satisfied. To my surprise, there are features included with this tripod that are on $40+ tripods! Two different bubble levelers, one for the base and another for the camera, an independent crank riser for additional height, multiple tightening locations to keep your camera in place, and the ability to hold your camera in both landscape and portrait.Since receiving this tripod, I did a &ldquo;test&rdquo; where I installed my camera and left it alone for almost five days with the legs fully extended and positioning locations locked / secured. This tripod held its position without any trouble, easing my concerns about it falling over and damaging my camera.One issue I found is related to my specific camera (See Image). When attached to the tripod, I am unable to flip the screen around due to the locking arm being in the way. This is not a major issue since you only need to release the camera, flip the screen as desired, and re-secure.Overall, I&rsquo;m completely satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend it to anyone. Take a look at my added images where I give a closer look of its features and capabilities.</p>

<h5 id="not-a-bad-first-tripod-for-the-price">Not a bad first tripod for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not bad, considering the price. But it has some fatal flaws:- there is too much friction in the plastic-on-plastic joints, which makes the up/down and left/right swivel actions very difficult to fine-tune- It&rsquo;s so lightweight that it&rsquo;ll be top-heavy if you have a heavy camera/rigging- The light weight also makes it impossible to not move/nudge it while adjusting it- the large mounting shoe covers the battery/SD card hatch on the bottom of my G7X. So I have to totally remove it in order to change the battery or put in a fresh storage card, negating the &ldquo;quick&rdquo; part of the &ldquo;quick mount&rdquo; system.The good parts:- it&rsquo;s light weight makes it nearly effortless to carry around- lots of flexibility in height adjustment</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tripod-for-the-price">Great tripod for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed something to use for a family photo session on vacation and bought this because I&rsquo;d lost the camera shoes for my old and much more expensive tripod. The pan/tilt is smooth, elevation crank is fairly smooth as well. The weight hook at the bottom of the tripod is a great addition and is needed since the tripod is light&ndash;if only I&rsquo;d used it for the family photo since it was a windy day and the tripod was blown over. There is a leveling bubble (works well) and the handle is a welcome addition. While I&rsquo;ve only used it for a few hours over the course of a couple of days in a sandy environment, the leg locks held well and all moving parts are still working without grit. I&rsquo;d buy it again if the need arose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-tripod-for-begginers-and-professionals">Perfect tripod for begginers and professionals</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am absolutely in love with this tripod. It does everything that I wanted from it and more. It allows me to take perfectly stable pictures and videos from my iPhone. I bought a universal mount and it fits right on here. The height is adjustable and it locks into place. You do not have to worry at all about it falling out of place. There are actual locks on the sides of the tripod so tht you can love it at 3 levels. Short, medium, and tall. You can easily maneuver your phone or camera. I used this with my phone and it works great. It is pretty stable for a lightweight tripod. It arrived in perfect condition and I have experienced no problems with it. It is easy to work and you are getting a truly quality product for a low price.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-just-what-i-was-looking-for">This is just what I was looking for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a basic, lightweight, stable, solid, inexpensive, won&rsquo;t-cry-if-I-lose/break-it tripod for still shots and non-critical video and this was just the ticket. I tried one from Walmart, about the same price but it may as well have been made out of stiff rubber. I invested in a midrange video tripod with a fluid head that does a beautiful job shooting video with truly beautiful pans and tilts, but it&rsquo;s large and heavy. This little guy really fits the bill.I&rsquo;m growing in my confidence in the AmazonBasics brand. Most of the time what we need is reasonably priced meat and potatoes functionality and they&rsquo;re really doing well at that. Thanks Amazon</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-servicable-light-a-bit-bulky">Very servicable, light, a bit bulky</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For context I am a hobbyist who hadn&rsquo;t bought a new tripod in something like 15 years. I was very impressed with this tripod. It has a solid and stable feel to it. It adjusts, easily, smoothly, and intuitively. It is reasonably light, though not light enough for hiking. It is also quite bulky, even when collapsed. The reason for the bulk is that this is the larger version of this tripod&ndash;they make a smaller version that might be of more practical use to many. For those who care about such things, the legs are constrained in how far they can swing out and cannot swing out independently of each other. It has a large handle for ease of moving around that can be a minor obstacle when setting up.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-travel-regular-use-tri-pod">Excellent Travel &amp; Regular Use Tri-Pod!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lightweight, easy to use. I have never had any problems with my AmazonBasics Tri-Pod. It is very easy to use, comes with a travel bag, and is super lightweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This feels like a pro tripod!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-not-a-professional-photographer-by-any-means-and-this-tripod-is-perfect-lite">I&rsquo;m not a professional photographer by any means and this tripod is perfect. Lite</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Paid $23 for it. I&rsquo;m not a professional photographer by any means and this tripod is perfect. Lite, packs up small and has a decent carrying bag. Should be perfect for my needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-good-quality-but-much-bigger-than-i-thought-i">Seems good-quality but much bigger than I thought. I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems good-quality but much bigger than I thought. I was hoping to folder it in my backpack, but I couldn&rsquo;t. Notice this if you want something very portable :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="surprised">Surprised!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pleasantly surprised by the quality! Wow! Lightweight, easy to set up and all the extras! Thanks Amazon, again you win out over my local selections.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-beginners-and-professionals">Great for beginners and professionals</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality and affordable! Great for beginners and professionals. I love mine and if I purchase any further cameras, I will buy this again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="alot-of-cool-features-but-execution-on-product-quality-is-bad">alot of cool features but execution on product quality is bad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>alot of cool features but execution on product quality is bad. lasted 1 weekend shooting a music festival before it started to fall to pieces. but really what do u expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightweight-is-a-good-word-to-use">Lightweight is a good word to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lightweight is a good word to use. And the fact it&rsquo;s mostly plastic means some of the motions of the tilt head aren&rsquo;t as smooth as I&rsquo;d like.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-price-but-kind-of-a-pain">Good price but kind of a pain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an ok tripod for the price. A couple weeks after getting it, one of the legs fell apart. Amazon replaced it right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value and works as expected</p>
