<h5 id="the-household-samples-are-well-worth-the-14-99-paid-not-to-mention-the-credit-received-which-pays-for-the-box">The household samples are well-worth the $14.99 paid, not to mention the credit received, which pays for the box.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is probably the best Amazon sample box I have ever received.Several of the products are full- or close to full-sized, such as the Viva towels, the Purell Healthy soap and the nicely packaged facial cleansing wipes.The wipes are a new product in my experience, and the packaging is both pretty and functional with wipes that are just the right size.There isn&rsquo;t a thing in the box I can&rsquo;t use.The product I chose for my free credit was the Kleenex go-anywhere packs. These snap onto your purse, gym or diaper bag.Each pack contains 30 3-ply tissues, soft and thick.I chose a box with 10 packs, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier with either the sample box or the packs for which I used my credit.The credit is very easy to use and will be applied automatically to whatever you choose to buy in full-size from the box.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-sampling-variety-worth-the">A great sampling variety, worth the $$$</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Definitely a great sample box that was full of everything you could think of for everyday use. My biggest surprise was the Kleenex to go pack and the full size Purel hand soap. They both came in handy. I hadn&rsquo;t seen the tissues in any stores as of yet. I was also impressed by the variety of products that arrived as well as the sizes. The fact I ordered a &ldquo;sample&rdquo; box I assumed all of the products would be samples, but a good majority of them were full sized products. Even if they weren&rsquo;t, some were multiple use vice one use products. It will quite difficult to decide which products to use my $14.99 credit from purchasing the sample box on, because there were so many great products to choose. The Amazon sample box program is probably one of the BEST things about being a Prime member. These sample boxes give you the opportunity to not only try a wide variety of products, but the purchase you make is a credit towards one of the items from that sample box. It is a win-win, even if you don&rsquo;t end up using your credit, you still come away with a box that was well worth every penny you spent (and maybe even more)! I look forward to finding out which sample boxes are available and trying them. Great marketing idea by the Amazon marketing team! We used these samples so quickly this time too, they were all AMAZING!</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-sample-box">I love this sample box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this sample box. It&rsquo;s probably my favorite so far. It comes with a great selection of household items that most everyone can use. There are a few brands and products that I have never tried before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, once again, something was leaking (I think the small pouch of Laundress detergent) all over the box. Off to choose what to spend my credit on!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-favorite-of-all-of-the-samples-are-the-wipes">My favorite of all of the samples are the wipes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first time buying a sample box, and boy is it worth it! I am surprised most of the products I got were sample sized. My favorite of all of the samples are the wipes. You can never go wrong with those. Once I absolutely love in particular are the Kleenex facial wipes. I am now convinced to switch my makeup removal to solely those wipes! The only con is the items that come in packets, I tend to neglect those and store them away immediately, but that is mostly on me. But all in all, I love it.I just bought the dog treats out, so I will soon see how awesome that package is too! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-box-hard-to-redeem-the-product-after">Good box, hard to redeem the product after</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed this sample box. Some products were very new to me such as Kleenex facial wipes, hand soap and natural laundry soap. What I really enjoyed was the coconut nature&rsquo;s gate body wash but when I tried to make a purchase it says it&rsquo;s a body lotion and not a body wash. That was a bit confusing and pulled me away from buying it. I have plenty of lotions around the house and was hoping to buy a new body wash. The laundry detergent was really great and smelled amazing but I thought was a bit overpriced. Overall, a great sample box but very difficult to redeem the actual product after.</p>

<h5 id="hands-down-the-best-sample-box-i-ve-received-from-amazon">Hands down the best Sample Box i&rsquo;ve received from Amazon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hands down the best Sample Box i&rsquo;ve received from Amazon.. The product sizes were outstanding, many being full size!!! All great brands, all great products&hellip;SINGLE only complaint was the one laundry soap sample (laundress? maybe?) was extremely strong smelling and stunk up the box.. definitely threw that one out as I could never wash my clothes in something that smelled so strong. But, that&rsquo;s not to say that others may really like the scent. It was just a very strong floral type scent.. Not my thing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The hand soap is terrible and smells like floor cleaner. The rest of the samples were nice, bigger than I thought they would be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great way to get out new products! I have ordered several of these sample boxes and have been able to use the majority of the items in each of them, often finding new favorites as well. I&rsquo;m this box I found the Kleenex Facial Wipes to be very pleasantly scented and removed my make up with ease. I had never thought to try nose wipes, but the Saline Soothers Nose Wipes were wonderful when I got a summer cold a few weeks ago. I love that the money that you spend for the sample box you get credited when you reorder an item that was in the box.</p>

<p>Good kit, didn&rsquo;t get everything in the picture though. Bought it when amazon had a promo - buy the kit and get a credit for = the amount you spent on any item in the kit.</p>
