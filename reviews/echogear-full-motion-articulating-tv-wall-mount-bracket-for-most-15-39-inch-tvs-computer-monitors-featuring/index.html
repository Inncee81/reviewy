<p>This versatile articulating monitor mount allows you to mount small screens almost anywhere. Perfect for both TVs &amp; computer screens, you can create a home office or gaming setup with your computers. Mount your TV in a corner, kitchen, bedroom, or anywhere else. With 10.5&rdquo; of extension and 90º of swivel, it can face almost anywhere. Echogear has an easy 3 step install, and US-based expert support available 7 days a week, this is one project even a rookie DIY&rsquo;er can handle.</p>

<p>Make your home office more functional and modern by mounting your 27” computer monitor. The articulating design lets you position the screen at the ideal viewing angle. Now when you hammer out that PowerPoint you can do so comfortably, and without screen glare.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a 32” TV and want it in your kitchen. With the articulating arm, this mount can extend and swivel the screen anywhere in the room. So no matter if you are slicing the scallions or frying the fritters, you’ll be able to watch TV. If that isn’t American as hell, I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>Are you a PC gamer? Mount multiple screens next to each other for a truly immersive experience. By mounting the screens, you’ll have more desk space for gaming accessories (or Red Bull cans). Don’t let those noobs crush you again.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is if you need an economical mount for screens 15”-39” with premium features, this is it.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-mount-with-very-good-instructions">very good mount with very good instructions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not much bad to say about this mount. Comes with an abundance of hardware to make adjustments and fit just about any monitor or TV imaginable. The true &lsquo;deal maker&rsquo; is the instruction packet. Actual words with complete sentences to accompany the clear pictures. The parts are separated into separate, well-labeled packets. There are very clear mounting suggestions and warnings.My only minor gripe is that the monitor tilt articulation requires an allen wrench. There is a knob on one side (right side) which implies one should be able to tilt-and-tighten fairly easily. Alas, the weight of even a 17&rdquo; LCD is too much if the screw on the other side isn&rsquo;t 100% tight. And, when it is tight, the tilt won&rsquo;t happen whether the knob is loos or not. So, the knob on the right seems pointless. The screw that seems to control the tilt requires an Allen wrench. Although one is supplied that fits the other articulating joints, this one is smaller. That&rsquo;s said, it&rsquo;s a minor inconvenience. I used one of my own and I&rsquo;m all set up. Maybe 15 minutes in total.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-mount-very-easy-to-install">Awesome Mount. Very Easy to Install.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first TV wall Mount Install. The instructions they include are awesome. This was so easy drill a simple hole. Line everything up, Following the instructions and install. 30 minutes and it was done and it looks awesome with my 27&rdquo; 4k monitor mounted. It was so easy I even just ordered a second for my other monitor. Adjustments are very easy and the movement is smooth. Highly recommend this brand for any mounting needs you might have.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-so-easy-to-install">NOT SO EASY TO INSTALL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi,I bought this on the strength of reviews that said it was easy to install. Sadly, not so much. Certainly not as easy as the official Echogear web page would have you believe. I don&rsquo;t do this kind of work every day, but did manage to renovate an entire apartment. So working with a drill and measuring tape aren&rsquo;t that strange to me. The EGSF1 product manual could just use a little more detail to make it easier on customers. For example, the page (attached) about the spacers was a complete mystery to me. A Google search helped fill the blanks (to a commenter asking the same question on Amazon for a different sized model). OTHERWISE, it&rsquo;s a good looking, highly functional product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easiest-installation-you-would-ever-do">Easiest Installation you would ever do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We all know that mounting a TV on your wall can sometimes be complicated and intimidating. But this product made the process as easy as 1,2,3. I was always scared to do such a job because I always thought I would mess it up, but this TV mount came with simple instructions that made it very easy for me to install. Also the build of the wall mount is very solid and holds my TV firmly in place, I love the multiple directions it is able to move in, as I can always get the right angle. I would suggest this mount to anyone that wants to do a simply job without feeling like they are going to screw up, plus it is going to look good in the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as intended, but a little information on the weight limit would be nice; I didn&rsquo;t realize about the weight until I put everything together. Although I used this to hang a 32 inch monitor which isn&rsquo;t very heavy&hellip;but still. The tilting and swiveling mechanisms work well for me.The whole thing feels very sturdy. For precaution purposes, before hanging anything onto this, pull it down with your own strength that is approximately the same as the weight of the tv/monitor you intend to hang; this is to make sure that it feels strong enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beefy">Beefy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount is overkill for what I need &ndash; simply to mount my computer monitor higher up on the wall so I&rsquo;m not always curving my neck as I work. It&rsquo;s clearly strong enough to hold much more. The instructions are clear, and every bit and piece I might need for any configuration is included and well-labeled. A good product that got here quickly. I&rsquo;m a happy camper.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-was-extremely-easy-to-install-and-work-as-intended">It was extremely easy to install and work as intended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was extremely easy to install and work as intended. The instructions and the many extensions/ways to install were extremely helpful. Support or customer service was good. They followed up after the sale to make sure I was happy with purchase. However I had to build my office first so t they were not installed right away. I didn&rsquo;t need to use their video help or need to contact them. The tilt and swing features are what I needed. They work well and reasonable in price, unlike a fully articulated arm that would provide vertical movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-as-a-rock">Solid as a rock!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure to cue them that you&rsquo;re mounting into block (if you are) as there are additional lags &amp; anchors required. Other than that one heck of a great deal and solid as a rock! Buy with confidence.</p>
