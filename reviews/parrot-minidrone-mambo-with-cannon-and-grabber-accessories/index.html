<h5 id="this-is-such-fun-i-bought-this-on-impulse-for-my-godson">This is such fun. I bought this on impulse for my godson</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such fun. I bought this on impulse for my godson, but having checked out the reviews and tested it, I just had to buy a second for myself.Parrot don&rsquo;t make drones which are suitable for aerial filmmaking or drone racing, they make toys for fun and this drone is about as much fun as it gets.It&rsquo;s really sturdy and super stable in flight. No RC experience is required. You press one button and it takes off and hovers 1m off the ground, press again and it will land. After that a few minutes experimenting with the controls and I was able to navigate carefully around my living room without crashing. So far I have only flown with the android app, but I have ordered a flypad, which promises better control and better range.It has two fun accessories. The first is the cannon, which is self explanatory, firing tiny green beads effectively enough to knock over a paper cup or annoy your coworkers. The second is a grabber, but in practice it is impossible to pick something up while in flight. The mambo can&rsquo;t maintain a stable hover below 1 foot. This is not a fault with the drone - ground effects from the propwash mean that it is very difficult to do this with any quadcopter. However you can close the grabber on an object while the drone is on the ground and then take off, dropping it later.It has a tiny 0.3MP camera underneath pointing vertically downwards, and some have complained that this is a little pointless, but the secret is that it uses this camera to hold its position horizontally. Vertically, it holds position using ultrasound at low altitude and a barometer at high altitude. You can set it to hover, leave it for a minute, check out something, come back and it will be roughly the same position. In fact I flew the drone at a ruin and accidently flew it out a small window losing sight and signal. When I went looking for it I found it hovering in place waiting for me.Supposedly it can only carry 4g of load, but I tested it with magnetic buckyballs and it managed to take off just under 20 grams.I timed it as just under 8 minutes flying time with the bumpers attached (no load, grabber or cannon). This sounds short, but in reality this is par for the course for this kind of drone. Parrot claim 9 minutes if the bumpers are detached, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend risking the props for 1 extra minute flying time. There is also a few neat features. You can set it to throw to take off. In this mode the props are started at a low rev, but when it detects you throwing it powers up and hovers where you throw it. Secondly it does acrobatic flips, when you double tap the screen. This is looks really cool, it pumps the throttle to get a bit of height and then flips (forward, backward, left or right) ending up where it started. It also includes a lego brick suitable for carrying stuff. Attached is a photo of the Mambo carrying Poppy the Troll, to the consternation of my toddler.Edit: To add a few things. First off if you enjoy this toy as much as I have, expect to buy a more batteries, prop guards &amp; props. I&rsquo;ve broken two prop guards already. I think parrot should include spare props and guards in the package. Also order a Parrot Flypad, because flying with the phone is vastly inferior.</p>

<p>I am a teacher who is teaching drone technology. This drone is so easy to fly and responds so well I will not have a problem using it to teach with. I highly recommend this drone and I am ordering 3 more.</p>

<h5 id="it-has-a-cannon">It has a cannon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My current favorite drone of the 4 that I own.I live in the upper midwest and it gets cold in the winter. This drone works well for playing with indoors. It&rsquo;s small enough to maneuver around the living room and still be able to flip, barrel roll, and shoot plastic bb&rsquo;s out of its cannon. Yep. It has a cannon. It appears to be lego compatible (testing yet to happen). It also has a grabber, but that is rather difficult to use and pick up something while mid flight, may be better to use it to grab something prior to take off. This drone has an amazing auto take off and landing feature that allows it to hover about 1m from the ground. When doing a trick maneuver it rises several feet so that it maintains elevation after flipping, so make sure you have clearance so that you don&rsquo;t run it into a ceiling.The drone does have some minor delay with the phone app controller, and I have yet to test it with the parrot minidrone rc controller (I have, but haven&rsquo;t used with this drone yet) It&rsquo;s nice that the app and controller and batteries are cross accessible with other parrot drones. It uses a camera aimed at the ground and sonar to hover 1m from the ground. the camera compares frames to stabilize the horizontal position of the drone and the sonar to determine its height. You can get post flight data of speed and height in the phone app. One issue is that if you pass something under the drone while it&rsquo;s hovering it will try to readjust its elevation. The drone does what it is designed to do, but it&rsquo;s a pain if you want to get underneath it to grab a photo.Lots of fun!</p>

<h5 id="this-one-is-way-better-much-more-stable-and-easier-to-fly-for">This one is way better. Much more stable and easier to fly for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just bought for son&rsquo;s birthday. Have had other remote drones/helicopters/etc. This one is way better. Much more stable and easier to fly for a beginner. Nice take-off option, where in one button it will start and hover about 2 feet or so above the ground and stay there. Connects via blue tooth to your cell phone, and runs through a free app. Cell phone app controls are pretty good, and my son could run this thing right out of the box after charging. Have had bad experiences on other devices in not being able to control the drone, but this one is very stable, controls are self-explanatory and responsive. Have only had it a few days, so don&rsquo;t know how &ldquo;tough&rdquo; it is to survive crashes, but it has had a few and been fine. This is an indoor drone, don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s heavy enough to fly outside in any kind of wind at all, but will try on calm day. Seems to get 8-9 minutes flying time on one charge. Battery recharges in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Great drone. Easy to fly and so much more fun than a hubsan x4. It was easy enough for a seven year old to fly it. flips are great, easy and super fast.</p>

<h5 id="fun-and-durable">Fun and durable</h5>

<p>Great for my kid and me too pretty much bullet proof with prop guards on. Battery life could be better but easily swapable so that&rsquo;s a plus.</p>

<h5 id="fun-easy-to-use">Fun! Easy to use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun! I had trouble using the smart phone as the controller so I bought the flypad. The pellet shooter is a cool idea and works pretty good. I have more fun just flying it though. It can do some tricks like a barrel roll and a flip with the touch of a button. Has approximate 6 minute fly time.</p>

<p>Like most drones, it&rsquo;s a bit fragile. But overall it&rsquo;s easy to fly (my son was 11 when he got it) and the gun and grasper work surprisingly well.</p>

<p>So close to a 5, I should just give it a 5. However, the short flight times of the battery don&rsquo;t leave me much choice. The Parrot Mambo comes standard with a 550 mAh battery.</p>
