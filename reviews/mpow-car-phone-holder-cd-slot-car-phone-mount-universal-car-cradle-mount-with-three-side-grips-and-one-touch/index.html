<h5 id="worth-the-money-for-a-quality-phone-holder">Worth the money for a quality phone holder.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchase cell phone holders every other month for use in my semi truck. Usually costing around $30 each. Most are almost worthless and break within weeks of purchase. The MPOW phone holder actually holds my phone in a convenient location. It vibrates a little but that&rsquo;s because everything in a semi truck vibrates. My initial thoughts are the quality of this holder seems very good, is easy to install and tighten up, and seems solid when mounted in the CD player. I&rsquo;m very happy then it still allows for easy operation of my stereo.Of course the question is how long will it last? Like I said, I purchased these cell phone holders every other month but this is the first time for the MPOW. This is day one and I will keep you updated on how well it holds.</p>

<h5 id="this-car-mount-is-the-best-mount-i-ever-use">This car mount is the best mount I ever use!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits in the cd slot perfectly and it will stay!!! I don’t like the way other car mount you need to stick it on the windshield, because my view would be obstructed by them, so I cannot see outside thoroughly and they are usually too far to be reached. Instead of being obstacle and hinder me from getting better view, this particular car mount sits perfectly on the center of the dashboard. It merely shake in little while on the go, and I can see my iPhone 5 without any problem. Because it sits right in the middle of the dashboard, it allows quick access to the phone and my wife and I have no problem touching the phone while driving. Rather than holding the phone while navigating the map, sometimes I also put my ipod in this car mount when playing music, so I can take a peek at what song it is playing and skip the song when needed.Overall, it is wonderful car mount. I don&rsquo;t have any complain using it.*Note, you need to press the button couple times to release the grips completely.The maximum open area is roughly 3 ¼ inches wide, so for the smart phone with larger screen might be difficult to fit in.</p>

<h5 id="great-concept">Great concept</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>It was explained to me via another buyer that you need to snap the ball into the threaded part in order for it to work properly. Snapping the ball in forces the threaded part open and creates enough tension to screw the piece on! It works like a charm now! I really love it!It&rsquo;s also worth it to mention that the sellers were extremely nice and helpful with this. When they saw my review they immediately asked how they could help fix it and offered a different product replacement as well as my money back. Very great to do business with them!Great idea. I was super excited because the CD part fit my 2014 Chevy Cruze really well and was the only cell holder that would work for my car without being in the way. Unfortunately, the piece that connects the holder to the cd slot portion is too large so when you tighten it, the ball slides right out. As you can see in the picture, the hole is the same size as the ball so it provides zero tension. Going to have to look into something else because this definitely won&rsquo;t hold a thing.</p>

<h5 id="incredible-little-mount-i-want-to-buy-them-for-everyone">Incredible little mount&hellip; I want to buy them for everyone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE this CD player mount! (Photos show an iPhone 7 Plus and also purchased for a regular sized iPhone 7) We haven&rsquo;t gone on our trip yet but what I&rsquo;ve used it for while driving around town has been a savior to my iPhone! I used to have a Steelie set-up and I had gotten a new phone so the magnet was tossed with the case. Before jumping to getting another Steelie (within 6 months, mine seemed to start sliding and facing down anyway), I decided to look for something new.I heard from a couple people who had a CD player mount that it was &ldquo;fine&rdquo; so I figured for a quick purchase and a single trip, it would suffice. Man, am I so happy I got these beauties! I feel like they look more classy than I was expecting too. It twists and turns anyway you want and it STAYS in place! I haven&rsquo;t used the little 3M stickers for gaps because it&rsquo;s hardly been shaking.Our cars had different thicknesses for CD players and they both worked&ndash; 2015 Hyundai Elantra and 2015 Subaru Crosstrek. I say for the price, especially on sale, it&rsquo;s totally worth snatching a mount up! So far this deserves more than 5 stars!</p>

<h5 id="works-great-functional-attractive-and-secure-screw-grip-is-a-little-odd">Works great, functional, attractive and secure. Screw grip is a little odd.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: Fits securely in a much friendlier spot than other cellphone holders. Secure fit in both the CD slot as well as for the phone. Easily adjustable. IT really was what I was looking for. It also doesn&rsquo;t leak cheap. It looks fairly nice compared to other phone mounts I&rsquo;ve had.Con: The 3-prong grip for screwing the mount in place ends up hitting the buttons/dash in my truck. I pretty much had to let it hit multiple times to get it tight enough. A round notched design would have been better for me. Slightly slow when releasing the phone. Bad when in a hurry.</p>
