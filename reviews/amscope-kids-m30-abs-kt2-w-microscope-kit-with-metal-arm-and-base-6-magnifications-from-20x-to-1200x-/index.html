<p>Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.</p>

<p>United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-impressed">Very Impressed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my daughter for Christmas next month. I thought I would give it a try since I saw all these bad reviews. This is an amazing microscope for the price and works really well. I have a history of working with them and found it very easy to find the samples on the slides. They also showed up really nicely. The key it to start with the smallest magnification (300), once you have found your sample and focused on it then attempt using the higher magnifications. Some of the slides are not meant to be seen with the highest magnification. Also be sure to clean all slides before viewing as all of ours had dust on them. It will be harder to see anything with dust on the slide. The eye piece also needed to be cleaned because it was dusty. The microscope is metal, the stage is plastic with plastic clips. I did find it a bit annoying that I could not move the stage from side to side, so when viewing I had to move the slide its self. I have not used the hatchery or any of the other things as I am gifting this in a month. Even without using those items I am very pleased with this product. It was better then I could have imagined. I cant wait to make slides with my daughter and see what we can see. I have included some images I captured of each slide with my camera. These are not as clear as they are when viewing it through the scope with your eyes. However I wanted to show everyone that this microscope does indeed work. I found all of the samples with in a matter of minutes besides the corn root (blue slide with small round circles on it all in rows). The corn root is pale yellow, making it hard to see with the light shining on it. So I used the blue light filter to help bring it out better. I hope this helps you all feel more comfortable about making your decision with this brand. The carrying case is a nice plus too.</p>

<h5 id="great-at-what-it-s-designed-for">Great at what it&rsquo;s designed for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great beginner microscope. I suspect that the majority of the low reviews for this microscope are from people that either have little microscope experience or were expecting it to do things it was never designed to do. I have a degree in biology (although I&rsquo;m not employed in a biological field), so I have plenty of experience using lab quality microscopes. This microscope produces a reasonable level of clarity and magnification. Children will be able to see individual cells, and even nuclei. Yes, it can be a little bit hard to focus at times since there is no fine adjustment, only coarse, and yes, your field of view does move a bit while adjusting it. But again, this is a $40 microscope made for kids. This is more than good enough to introduce your child (or even adults) to the world of microscopy. The kit is great, and will give the user plenty of things to do with the microscope. A few prepared slides, and tools to make some simple slides of your own are included, along with the brine shrimp kit. I was pleasantly surprised by what this microscope can do, and can&rsquo;t wait to give it to my daughter for the holidays (I took it out of the box and tested it first due to some of the bad reviews on here). If you are inexperienced with microscopes, here are a few tips: make sure that what you are trying to view is in the center of the aperture (where the light comes through), and always start on the lowest magnification.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for the price! Bought it for homeschooling and the kids love it. They are 9, 10, &amp; 11 and can use it without any help. Came with some great extras and has already provided hours of entertainment! Would recommend for any grade school aged children.</p>

<h5 id="the-magnification-isn-t-that-great-there-is-no-xy-movement-for-the-mount">The magnification isn&rsquo;t that great. There is no xy movement for the mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was expecting something small and not very robust. I was not expecting something with so many issues. There are a lot of artifacts and smudges everywhere making it very hard to see anything. Just big blotches covering the field of view, making it hard to make things out. The brine shrimp experiment is nonsense. Instead of providing containers or a small amount of shrimp or salt, it asks for you to make a liter of solution and then add the eggs, waiting for something to happen. Then you&rsquo;re supposed to feed them with yeast, not provided. And somehow get them on slides without droppers or any real aid. I didn&rsquo;t manage to get them to hatch, so I guess it&rsquo;s moot.There are a lot of peices, but they don&rsquo;t seem to come together. The magnification isn&rsquo;t that great. There is no xy movement for the mount, making it hard to find things to focus on.</p>

<h5 id="awful-dont-waste-your-time">Awful - Dont waste your time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read all the reviews before purchasing and knew some people said it did not work and was junk and others said those users were just not using it properly, so I decided to give it a try since it looked like such a great kit. Big mistake! Was incredibly difficult to use and focus for me, let alone my son who worked hard to earn the microscope. I felt bad because he kept asking to use it and I kept trying and had other adults try as well with no success. Only good news is that amazon provided amazing customer support and issued us a full refund. Dont waste your time!</p>
