Some of the worst performing cards in this review also happen to be the most expensive.Not all 633x cards are created equal. The two cards reviewed from Lexar and Transcend are both marked as 633x but vary in performance greatly.4k video recording using action cams and drone cameras have a typical bitrate of 60mbps or 100mbps, corresponding to 7.5MB/s to 12.5MB/s. All cards in this review should theoretically be able to handle this usage easily.Using microsd card as supplemental phone storage potentially could benefit from a faster card,Best Looking Card (if it matters):Sandisk Extreme Pro: Red/Gold with white printLexar 1000x: White/Gold with Black/White printSamsung Pro+: White/Black with a red stripe and Black/White printPNY Turbo: Lime Green/Black with Black/White printUpdate 9/14/2015: Added additional cards to the list.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="now-isn-t-this-just-great">Now Isn&rsquo;t This Just Great?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently picked this 64GB card up to be used for storage within my new, refurbished HP G2 Revolve 11.6 inch laptop/tablet. This computer has a 128MB SSD and with it&rsquo;s i5 processor and 12GB of RAM, I can do serious work with this machine. So I chose this as a second drive in order to keep the small SSD cleaner by putting music, videos and downloads onto it.I had been using a PNY thumb drive until this arrived and I transferred 22GB from that flash to this one. It started at over 51MB/s and settled on 47MB/s after a bit. There are faster models available, but when doing my shopping, what I found was from 40 - $50 and this one was $28. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that I will not be paying that much more to save up to 30% of the time it takes to do just writing to this card, when 3GB worth of transfer won&rsquo;t take over a minute anyway. You can read files with about the same speed as the other, more expensive models.This came formatted exFat at 59.5GB and doesn&rsquo;t come with the full sized adapter, but I have several and tried this in two of my cameras, and although I do have a faster, full sized card in my D5200, I can&rsquo;t tell the difference when continuous shooting. I also know that this writes at least 20MB/s faster than what&rsquo;s recommended for 4K recording, so the only problem anyone would have, would be camera specific and due to incompatibility.Often I purchase the fastest drive possible, because it always speeds up a system when the OS is on it, but not so much in this case. If you&rsquo;re using this card for recording, well, another card can&rsquo;t record or playback any faster, so all you&rsquo;ll get is faster transfers to your computer to edit files. Check on those cards that are above 90 or 95MB/s read speed and see if you want to spend that much more than $28 just for faster transfers. The really fast models are not worth the extra expense to me in these circumstances.As for reliability, I have several PNY cards and an older UHS 64GB is what used to be the first, and is still my second card for the D5200 and has been filled countless times in past two years, and I expect no less from this one, but I&rsquo;m at weeks now instead of years.So being practical, this card is all you need and it&rsquo;s low priced, so all you need to do now is check for compatibility issues with your device and look for others saying that it does or doesn&rsquo;t work well with the device that you want it for. Oh, and then pull the trigger and purchase one for yourself.Recommended, and I wish you good luck with all your online purchases.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="endless-corrupt-files">Endless corrupt files!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stay far far away from this card. Just got it a week ago and it&rsquo;s already showing tons of corrupted files on my new S7 Edge. It definitely wasn&rsquo;t damaged because my phone is just fine and it&rsquo;s in a waterproof tray with the sim card. Some pics worked, others just say read error. Took this card with my phone on a vacation. That&rsquo;s a week&rsquo;s worth of memories that I&rsquo;ll never get back. Don&rsquo;t waste your time with this. The tested speeds are good, but what&rsquo;s the point if it has corrupt files! Total waste of money.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="simply-not-as-advertised-not-meeting-specifications-and-not-reliable">Simply not as advertised&hellip;. Not meeting specifications and not reliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this card back about 6 months ago for use in my Moto X Pure. It seemed to worked well for a few months and then I started have issues related to speed. Currently it takes about 45 seconds to delete a couple of 5 mb pictures. Major major lag. I am only using about 6 gb of space on a 64 gb card. So, I thought I would format the card to see if I could get a performance improvement. Reformatting did nothing. Finally I decided to try a few benchmarking programs. I get read speeds anywhere from 58- 85 mb/sec. I get write speeds of 4- 9 mb/sec. There is also an issue with the identity of this card. Every device and software sees it as Lexar card. At this juncture, I am deeply disappointed. The speed rating and U3 specification are simply not being met. I have a class 10 sd card that is 5 years old with better write speeds. I don&rsquo;t know if this is a counterfeit card or what is going on. Maybe it is just dying a slow death? Anyway, I cannot recommend this card at all.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="not-a-uhs-3-not-4k-compatible">Not a UHS 3, not 4K compatible.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The memory clearly states that it is a UHS-3 memory card. Neither my Sony Action Cam or my A7sR will recognize it as such. Those who have argued that this card is not a 4k card are indeed correct, I regret that I did not heed to the reviews.READ MORE</p>
