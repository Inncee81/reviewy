<blockquote>
<p>My main issue with iPhone has always been the fact that you are locked in with the size of the memory. Samsung used to provide greater freedom than Apple until recently when they started following Apple’s model. I acquired an iPhone reluctantly. I am not too happy with the restriction from expanding the memory on my phone. I own an iPhone 6. I have downloaded some apps, and some music. I am already out of space. I cannot keep pictures on my phone for over a week without getting that message that I am out of space. It is annoying and aggravating. I constantly have to delete my pictures.If you find yourself in a similar situation, then, save yourself some trouble and get the HooToo 64G iPhone flash drive USB 3.0 model HT-IM003. I have received this device for a review at the right time as I am traveling. I take a lot of pictures, videos, and also carry with me my presentations. I no longer need to have my computer with me. I carry my phone and I have all this information available to me not on my phone, and not on the cloud. They are all located on the HooToo flash drive. No worries, I do have backup, but the flash drive has made it much more convenient.Think about the drive size, it is 64GB of capacity. I am not sure that I can even afford the iPhone with 64GB. With such capacity, I can now download my shows from Xfinity to view later.The drive is faster than all my previous drives. I took it with me everywhere during my travel to instantly free up more space, enjoy more content and have more freedom with my phone. And extra 4mm extension means the lightning connector works with most of thick cases without having to take them off The USB end plugs into any computer USB ports and offers USB 3.0 data transfer speeds. It reads up to 80 MB/s and writes up to 40 MB/s. It is amazing.In addition, if you already have the application iPlugmate, you may get an update. Otherwise, just download it, and you will be in business. It is by far the best companion for my Apple device, and my Tablet mini. After download it, I was able to access the drive to stream movies, listen to my YouTube videos stored on the flash drive directly, saving valuable spaces on my phone for applications instead of data.One of my favorite features is how light and compact this device is. It expands the storage of my iPhone and yet it is portable. I am yet to misplace it which is very unusual for me.I cannot find any drawbacks about this device. I have enjoyed itI have been using this device since. I highly recommend it to everyone.A sample was provided for review</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the size of most flash drives, about the height of a AA battery, it is more in the shape of a key and would look great on any key ring as a inconspicuous accessory. The box that it comes in is actually worth mentioning, it isn&rsquo;t a blister pack, or just a ziplock bag, it is a small box with a foam insert, it also has a cool little fabric tab that makes it easy to open the box, it is the little design enhancements that make this pretty cool. The USB drive itself is really nice, The USB 3.0 side doesn&rsquo;t have a lid, but the lightening connector does have a lid.USB 3.0 flash drives are still not as easy to find as USB 2, so this is a treat with the speed of the USB 3.0 on one side and lightening on the other.The lightening connector for &ldquo;I&rdquo; devices was super easy to use, when I plugged this into the IPad, it asked to install the &ldquo;iPlugmate&rdquo; app from the App Store, once that is installed, you open the app and you have a nice view of storage. The app also makes it really easy for you to copy/transfer files back and forth between your phone or iPad and flash drive. Then it makes it so much faster to be able to transfer those photos, or movies to your computer as a backup if you aren&rsquo;t backing up to the cloud. I know many people live off the cloud, but there are some who still have pictures on their external hard drive or pc and giving you the ability to move things back and forth is so much faster.I copied a couple of different movies to the iPlugmate drive, a .mkv, .avi, and .mp4 to see if they could be played directly on the IPad without any additional software, and all the files played great, no lag or anything, they didn&rsquo;t take anytime to buffer, they just played. They were different formats and different file sizes. So, you can quickly copy a file to the thumb drive over USB 3 from your desktop or laptop and then you can quickly play it on your iPad. The iPlugmate interface is really good looking, you have photos, videos (just videos from your camera, not movies you have downloaded from itunes), music, backup, file/folder, and system.I think most people are aware that the iPad usually won&rsquo;t play avi or mkv files, and this will, the player is great. If you click on the Internal storage section within the app, you have access to the camera pictures and videos and you are able to backup the contacts, so it doesn&rsquo;t have access to all your iPad files, just pictures, home movies and backups. You do have access to everything you put on the iPad using the iPlugmate app section. I love how this is so easy to use and gives you access to things you usually wouldn&rsquo;t have access to. I love my movies and giving my iPad the ability to play movies other than .mp4 or .m4v is awesome.Pros:Able to play files directly from drivePlay files other than .mp4 files in the iPlugmate appSpeedDesignCons:None</p>
