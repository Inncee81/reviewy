<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Length:25 Feet (Single Pack)  |  Style:HDMI Male to Male
Overview:</p>

<p>The HDMI cable is the newest and best digital video connection on the market. HDMI is the only cable that can transfer uncompressed high-definition video and multi channel digital audio in resolutions higher than 1080p. HDMI cables are convenient because they will allow the transfer of digital audio and video in a single cable, permitting a less confusing mess of wires and a cleaner entertainment center. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>

<p>1080p Resolution. Audio Return Channel 3D - 3D is the latest rage for both home theater and gaming.</p>

<p>4K - The 4K resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 24 Hz.</p>

<p>Deep Color - The Deep Color feature provides a minimum of 8-bits per color element (24-bits total), providing for a total of over 16 million color variations. x.v.Color - x.v.Color High Definition Audio - HDMI supports a full range of high definition audio types, including SA-CD, DVD-Audio, DTS-HD Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD.</p>

<p>Specifications:</p>

<p>Our High Speed HDMI cables - with Ethernet have been designed to meet the performance standards. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.</p>

<p>HDMI Ethernet Channel- The HDMI cable adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.</p>

<p>Audio Return Channel- The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio &ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;upstream&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback. In cases where a TV features an internal content source, such as a built-in tuner or DVD player, the Audio Return Channel allows the TV to send audio data upstream to the A/V receiver via the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for an extra cable.</p>

<p>3D Support- The version of the specification defines common 3D formats and resolutions for HDMI-enabled devices, enabling 3D gaming and other 3D video applications.</p>

<p>4K Resolution Support- The new specification enables HDMI devices to support extremely high HD resolutions, effectively four times the resolution of a 1080p device. Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="25ft-of-high-quality-at-a-great-price">25ft of high quality at a great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased this I was not concerned about the fact it was such a great deal but was curious to see how thick the cable and shielding would be on this product. I worked at Best Buy as a Home Theater Sales Rep and can tell you that Digital is Digital. The price you pay for Monster Cable is mostly for the hype and the production and pre-retail price of those cables are next to nothing. Regardless of gases injected into the cable or how thick the shielding a 1080p signal will still be a 1080p signal. The whole reason you need shielding is in case of possible interference but for a Home Theater application this is not a cause for concern because of the large number of cables you would need to even experience any interference.This cable is very robust. The cable is much thicker than expected and the rubber shielding is more than I will likely ever need. The picture quality meets all my expectations for an HDMI cable and carries digital picture and sound exceptionally. I am proud of my purchase and can promise that you will be as well.Amazon, thank you for another great product and purchase!</p>

<h5 id="quality-built-hdmi-cable-25-feet-of-goodness">Quality Built HDMI Cable, 25 Feet of Goodness!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>HDMI cables are wonderful - Audio AND video through one wire, with nice, usb-like rectangular (actually, is it more like a trapezoid?) plugs. This 25 foot cable is a BEAST, and I mean that in terms of length. the quality of the cable itself is great, thick, but not overly thick and stiff like some cables. The rubber coating is smooth, and protects nicely. The ends of the cable are great as well - sturdy, and with a good chunk of plastic around the connectors to grip.The quality of this cable are great, Don&rsquo;t get something super flimsy and weak! Get this quality cable and go!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-amazing-value">Absolutely amazing value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No question about it: This cable, at a bit over $6 when I bought it, blew a $24 cable I bought at Micro Center out of the water. This one? 25ft. That one? 15ft. And this one cost about 30% as much.Picture and sound quality were quite good, sending from my laptop to both 1080i and 1080p HDTVs. The $24 cable never did get sound working (my HDMI drivers said it was an HDMI-to-DVI link and that I&rsquo;d need a separate cable for audio), but I have not yet had the chance to test this cable on that particular HDTV. I will update this review when I get that chance.I do think that one end of the cable shipped to me had a slight manufacturing defect in the connector&ndash;plugging it into my laptop&rsquo;s HDMI port (but not the HDTV I was using then) felt like forcing it the first few times, but it works fine now that it&rsquo;s been exercised a bit. The only other downside to this cable vs. the $24 one I had is a lack of plastic covers for the connectors&ndash;but that&rsquo;s an extra that really isn&rsquo;t worth paying 3-4x the price for a shorter cable.If you&rsquo;re looking for a real reason NOT to buy this cable&hellip;sorry, I can&rsquo;t give you one.</p>

<h5 id="really-good-hdmi-cable">Really Good HDMI Cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This inexpensive HDMI cable works as well as any other HDMI cable I have used. My main use for this cable is between my laptop and my TV when I&rsquo;m using Slingbox. Both audio and video are clear. The cable is well made, much better quality than I expected at this price.</p>

<h5 id="after-30-minutes-we-were-able-to-remove-it-however-the-cord-is-completely-useless-to-us-now">After 30 minutes we were able to remove it however the cord is completely useless to us now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Plugged this into the back of our tv and went to switch it to the main HDMI hookup and when we pulled it out the gold tip came off and was stuck in the tv&rsquo;s HDMI port. After 30 minutes we were able to remove it however the cord is completely useless to us now. You can tell how cheaply made they are when you can mold and bend the connector piece. Disappointed after taking the time to run this through the wall only to have this happen.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-and-inexpensive">Works great and inexpensive!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took the advise of CNET and it paid off!See the CNET review &ldquo;Quick Guide: HDMI and HDMI cables&rdquo;[&hellip;]CNET strongly recommends cheap HDMI cables widely available from online retailers instead of the expensive counterparts sold in your local electronics store.Here&rsquo;s why:Expensive cables aren&rsquo;t worth itIf you walk into your typical electronics store to buy an HDMI cable, you&rsquo;re likely to see prices upward of $50 with promises of better performance and faster speeds. Do you really need to spend that much money on a single HDMI cable?Absolutely not&ndash;those cables are a rip-off. You should never pay more than $10 for a standard six-foot HDMI cable. And despite what salesmen and manufacturers might tell you, there&rsquo;s no meaningful difference between the $10 cable and the $50 cable. Unless you see something obvious, such as dropouts or a flashing screen, the digital information transmitted by both cables is exactly the same&ndash;no cable can make the picture any better or any worse. We&rsquo;ve used cables from many different companies in the past&ndash;such as Belkin, Accell, Monoprice, Monster, and SimplayHD&ndash;and have not run into any consistent issues with any brand of cable. With working cables and solid connections, we&rsquo;ve seen no dropouts and &ldquo;sparklies&rdquo;&ndash;just consistent, dependable, high-quality audio and video. It&rsquo;s that simple.Even a heavy-duty, high-end Monoprice cable cost us less than $20. But feel free to buy a cheaper one for a standard home theater.The editors at CNET are so confident that cheap HDMI cables offer identical performance, we&rsquo;ve been using inexpensive Monoprice HDMI cables in the CNET Home Theater Lab for more than a year with no issues. That&rsquo;s saying a lot, especially when you consider that our video experts are constantly swapping in new products and changing configurations, which means our cables take much more abuse than they would in a normal home theater. We&rsquo;re also accustomed to making long cable runs, and many of our cables from Monoprice are 15 feet long. We also use even longer 20-foot cables from a generic maker with no appreciable loss in video quality. If cheap HDMI cables are good enough for the eagle-eyed video professionals at CNET, we&rsquo;re betting they&rsquo;re good enough for your home theater.And don&rsquo;t get hung about other cables that offer a lifetime guarantee, protecting you in case your cables are technologically obsolete in the future. If in a few years there are consumer video products that output higher-than-1080p video signals (an admittedly unlikely scenario), you can always buy another cheap $10 cable online that can handle more data. And you&rsquo;ve still saved yourself $30 over that $50 cable in the store.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-cable-for-incredible-value">Amazing cable for incredible value!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cable is insanely awesome for the price. The construction is very sturdy and well done, I know for sure I wont have any problems with the insulation ripping or breaking in any way. The connections themselves are gold plated so it&rsquo;s got great picture and sound quality. It&rsquo;s so well done the ends even have little dust caps which was very nice. I will definitely buy from this company again whenever I need any other cable needs. Great value for sure!!!!</p>
