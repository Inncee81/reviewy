<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve detailed my struggles with Sjogren&rsquo;s Syndrome and its effects on my teeth and gums in lots of reviews at this point. I bought this water flosser because my gums are too fragile for real floss. I&rsquo;ve considered something like this for years, but always the name brands that were twice as much money. Which I don&rsquo;t have.So, I figured I would try this. I had concerns, but if it didn&rsquo;t work out, I figured the cash outlay wasn&rsquo;t enough to kill me, and if it does work, I may get to keep my teeth.1. It doesn&rsquo;t leak. It does make a mess if you don&rsquo;t stay leaned over the sink and if you don&rsquo;t keep on hand on the off button.2. It works so much better than floss. I have some crowded teeth that trap food bits like little vises. This blasts right through them, and my mouth feels good afterwards.3. It comes with lots of tips. Enough for my whole family.4. It goes from very gentle to quite powerful.5. Don&rsquo;t use cold water if you have sensitive teeth! I believe I actually felt my soul leave my body for a second.6. My educated guess is that the name brands are even better than this, but for my budget - and my issue - this is wonderful.I bought this and paid full price for it. I would do it again in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this review because honestly, this product only has one review and that was by someone who received a free product.I decided to purchase a water flossing/irrigator machine because I thought that it would be better than flossing for my crowns and I also have a couple spaces that trap food.I was going to buy the name brand models, until I saw the H2ofloss machine. I was weary at first because it only had one review, but it comes with 12 different tips, and seemed like a nice machine. I am glad that I decided to buy this item!First off, it is a great price for a high quality machine. It is a nice size and fits nicely on our bathroom counter. The pressure control IS on the handle of the irrigation handle, however&hellip;it does not move easily, it actually clicks to each pressure level. You will only need the lowest to the third setting honestly.You get 12 tips! they have different colored bases so that different people in your family can use them. The machine has on board storage and that is removable to clean out as well, which is awesome!My favorite is the periodontal tip, and the basic one.the on and off switch is on the machine, also that is not an issue. Just put the irrigation tip into your mouth BEFORE switching it on. and switch it off before you take it out.I do suggest using warm water vs cold and also, you can add some listerine to the water!There was also an issue mentioned in the other review about the water tank dripping as you move it to be filled or emptied. That has happened a couple of times, but usually it does not do it. And it is a very insignificant thing honestly.So, for the price 39.99 and prime if you have it, you cannot beat this machine.I am honestly taking my time to write this, because I want other people to be able to get a great deal on a great machine vs spending more for a machine that comes with less attachments etc.I also wanted to mention that the machine was packaged very nicely and secure! so many thanks to the manufacturer for that!hope this helps! happy flossing! :)</p>

<p>UPDATE: October 19, 2016 - It&rsquo;s been a month short of a year since I received this. I&rsquo;ve used it every day since and it has not leaked, it has not faltered, it is working well. My only complain at this point is I dislike the handle mounted slider for controlling the pressure. It is too easy to accidentally move it and the pressure adjustments are rather coarse. I&rsquo;d prefer a unit mounted dial to adjust the pressure. Otherwise this has performed very well. As good as if not better is some ways than my previous favorite made my WaterPik.UPDATE: Nov 17, 2015 - I&rsquo;ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars because the manufacturer has improved the valve in the water reservoir to eliminate the leaking that I demonstrate in my video review. The previous valve was just a black rubber insert in the bottom of the water reservoir. The upgraded valve is now spring loaded and of a 2 piece design. It eliminates the leaking and thus eliminates my criticism. This is a great machine and is equal or superior to the WaterPik. Plus this has nasal irrigation capabilities. I&rsquo;ve added photos to show the old black valves and the new improved white spring loaded valve.&mdash;This is a review of the H2oFloss oral irrigator. I received a free sample for my unbiased review. The opinions expressed are my own.I am a huge proponent of using an Oral Irrigator. I&rsquo;ve been using one for years, my most recent model used is the WaterPik WP-100W, It has always been my impression that WaterPik pretty much dominates the Oral Irrigation market. I also feel that this H2OFloss oral irrigator is a viable, good quality alternative to the WaterPik.The base is sized about 7&rdquo; wide, 4 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; deep and stands about 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; tall. The power cord is 50&rdquo; in length. It runs fairly quietly and about the same loudness as my WaterPik. Two separate plastic compartments are on the top of the unit, one holds up to 7 tips, the other is the water reservoir.This has a large water capacity of 800ml/27oz (quite a bit larger capacity than the WaterPik) and will operate for about 3 minutes at full pressure. Pressure is adjusted by a sliding control on the handle. You can adjust the pressure to a very faint stream or to a very powerful stream that is actually capable of causing your gums to bleed. You must use caution that you do not set the pressure too high. My biggest complaint with this device is I would prefer the water pressure adjustment to be on the base rather than the handle because it is too easy to accidentally cause the pressure to increase when using this in your mouth. It&rsquo;s happened to me several times and it is painful when it happens. Having the pressure adjustment on the base, as the WaterPik has it, prevents that from happening.A complaint I have about the water reservoir is that if you remove it in order to fill it with water rather than using a measuring cup or something to fill it with, water will dribble out of the small rubber interface that connects the reservoir to the base. I could not tighten or adjust the small piece to stop this from occurring. It is a nuisance.An assortment of color coded tips are included. 4 jet tips, 2 tongue cleaning tips, 2 orthodontic tips, 2 periodontal tips and 2 nasal irrigation tips.As for my reservations, I don&rsquo;t care for the pressure adjustment on the handle although some people may actually prefer it and the water that leaks out of the water reservoir when it is being removed to be filled, is a big nuisance,My overall impression of this oral irrigator is positive despite the couple of nuisances it has. It seems to be every bit as good in quality as the WaterPik WP-100W with larger water capacity, about the same level of quiet operation and effective pressure&hellip; possibly too much pressure in fact. Being able to use this as a nasal irrigation device as well as an oral irrigator is a big plus.WaterPik has some competition.</p>
