</ul>

<p>High Detail, Even in Low Light</p>

<p>1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor
At 1.0 inch, the image sensor on the PowerShot G9 X camera is larger than the ones on most other compact cameras. This allows it to capture a greater range of light, so bright areas of the image, like clouds on a sunny day, can be more detailed and less likely to be washed or blown out. With low-light scenes, like when you&rsquo;re indoors or outside at night, an ISO range of 125–12800 lets you use fast shutter speeds to help keep photos sharp and virtually unaffected by camera shake. The 20.2 Megapixel* resolution is outstandingly high, giving you the option of printing out bigger photos or cropping in to highlight the best part.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor
The PowerShot G9 X camera is powered by the latest iteration of Canon&rsquo;s proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which takes still and video image quality to a beautiful level. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that&rsquo;s exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G9 X, powering full-resolution high-speed continuous still shooting (even in P, Av, Tv and M modes) and the advanced star shooting modes. The processor allows for MP4 video recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. The processor also supports an MF Peaking function, giving you a pro-level focusing tool.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM
The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G9 X camera: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with exceptional clarity and detail.</p>

<p>Clear Photos in Almost Every Light</p>

<p>3x, f/2.0–4.9 Optical Zoom Lens (28–84mm)
The PowerShot G9 X camera has an impressive zoom lens with a remarkable optical zoom range, helping you capture wide shots like a big party scene or a gorgeous canyon, or enabling you to zoom in and get a wonderful close-up. The fast aperture goes as low as f/2.0, meaning it&rsquo;s possible to see the subject and take clear photos in low light, often without a flash. Combined with Intelligent IS image stabilization, it helps to ensure virtually shake-free images, even in dark rooms or outside at night.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
Equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS, the PowerShot G9 X camera helps you capture clear, steady images – even in low light without using a tripod. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the Image Stabilizer is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Slim and Stylish</p>

<p>Pocket-size Camera
At only 7.37 ounces (209g), the PowerShot G9 X is a compact camera that&rsquo;s not much bigger than a deck of cards, and can easily fit into a pocket or purse. Despite its size, it packs a large, high-quality image sensor and fast f/2.0 lens. These work together with features such as the DIGIC 6 processor to help create high quality photos, even in low light. This means you can have a camera within easy reach that&rsquo;s able to deliver detailed images that show the texture of clothing fabric, the colors of a sunset or the moment a player kicks a ball at the goal.</p>

<p>Intuitive User Interface</p>

<p>3.0-inch LCD Touch Panel
The 3.0-inch touch panel is designed to take advantage of both hands while holding the camera so you can make adjustments while still being ready to snap a photo. The menus are customizable, meaning the settings you adjust frequently are easily accessible. You&rsquo;re also able to swipe quickly through photos you&rsquo;ve taken, and tap the screen to easily adjust picture options and change what the camera is focusing on. In addition, the control ring around the lens can be rotated with your fingers to make adjustments to various settings, simplifying the process even further.</p>

<p>Intuitive Controls
Control Ring and Touch Panel
Quick, simple adjustments are ideal when you&rsquo;re trying to capture the great moments in life. The PowerShot G9 X camera uses a combination of a responsive, 3.0-inch touchscreen and a smoothly rotating control ring around the lens. Your right thumb can pick the setting you&rsquo;d like to change, and then your left fingers can rotate the control ring to adjust it, all without lowering the camera or taking your finger off the shutter. For example, if you&rsquo;re trying to capture a dog playing in the sun, you can quickly adjust the shutter speed with a tap of the menu and a twist of the control ring to get the amount of detail you desire, while keeping a bit of blur to show action.</p>

<p>Enhancing the Movie Experience
1080p Full HD and Expanded Movie Options
With its large sensor and high performance lens the PowerShot G9 X camera creates spectacular 1080p Full HD video, but this premium model takes video-making even further with several high-end features. Set video capture to your shooting needs: 24p, 30p or 60p, with MP4 format available for easy sharing. Advanced audio includes expanded dynamic range and a better S/N ratio. Improved Dynamic IS significantly reduces shaking caused by handheld shooting. Manual controls (Av, Tv and ISO) can be set prior to and during shooting for full creative expression, and Manual Focus is also available. Shooting to commercial specifications is now possible with HDMI Live Out for checking images on an external monitor, and an advanced tripod socket for smooth panning and tilting.</p>

<p>Connect and Share With a Touch
Built-in Wi-Fi Makes Sharing Quick and Easy
Built-in Wi-Fi technology is included for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends, family and the whole world. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Google Drive – through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY*** directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS and Android devices<em>, and upload images via the free Canon Camera Connect app</em> without a computer.

<h5 id="great-combination-of-features-in-a-small-package">Great combination of features in a small package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little camera. My big camera is a 5D Mark III, but often it&rsquo;s too large and heavy to carry around. This is the perfect size to slip into my pants when I want something discreet. I&rsquo;ll compare this to the RX100 (I and IV) and the G7X; my family have owned these so I&rsquo;m pretty familiar with them.To start, compact cameras are all about tradeoffs. Different photographers value features like view finder, tilting LCDs, lens reach and brightness differently. You have to figure out which tradeoffs you want to make, and there&rsquo;s really never been a better time with so many great options in cameras to suit your needs. Personally I want the smallest camera that has a 1&rdquo; sensor. The smaller it is the more likely I&rsquo;ll take it to events instead of leaving it in a drawer.Size: This is significantly thinner than both the RX100 (especially the IV) and G7X. It makes it much easier to carry around. It&rsquo;s also quite a bit lighter, but that&rsquo;s not as big of an issue for me. Although the camera seems well built, it&rsquo;s not as sturdy as the solid RX100. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;ll survive falls as well as the RX100 or G7X.Handling: the touch display is really well done (finally Canon!). Of course, the RX100s don&rsquo;t have touch screen. Once you get used to it, it makes changing the options much faster and intuitive. Selecting the focus area is also very useful and fast. At first I thought I would miss the wheel, but it seems like a good decision to remove it to make more room for the LCD. I do wish that the LCD had smaller frame so that it&rsquo;s an extra half inch larger. Other than that, the front dial is a pleasure to use with its ticks, and the other buttons seem solid and are well placed.Misc: there&rsquo;s a flash, but you can&rsquo;t move the angle. I wish Canon would have used the same one that&rsquo;s on the G7X so that we can bounce it off the ceiling. It seems unfortunate that they skimped on this; it&rsquo;s the biggest thing I miss. There&rsquo;s no electronic viewfinder or tilting screen; both features I find not very important and make the camera unnecessarily bigger.Picture quality: this is the most important thing of course, so I&rsquo;ve saved it for last. To start, the lens is bright when it&rsquo;s wide, but zooming in takes it to 4.9. This is a tradeoff for size; if you want a brighter lens when zoomed in, the G7X is a better option. Personally, I find that most pictures I take with a compact are not zoomed in, so this size tradeoff is better for me. The 1&rdquo; sensor combined with f2.0 lens and image stabilization means I can take pictures at ISO 3200 in dimly lit restaurants without flash that come out bright (much more than what we see with our eyes) and also contain a lot of detail. The pictures come out great when looking at the laptop, even at 100%. However, if you&rsquo;re a pixel peeper, there&rsquo;s no way to deny that the RX100 IV will take sharper pictures, as I&rsquo;ve noticed in a few test comparisons. If you want the absolute best quality, you&rsquo;ll have to spend double the price of the G9X for that, and end up with a bigger camera (although it does include EVF and brighter lens).So which camera should you get? If money is of no concern and you want the highest quality pictures, and don&rsquo;t mind a camera that&rsquo;s <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> deeper, get the RX100 IV. If you want only one camera and you&rsquo;ll use it often when zoomed in, then probably the G7X will be better. However if this is a secondary camera that you use when your DSLR is too bulky, then the G9X represents the best tradeoffs in terms of size, quality, and price.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE- (after 2 months, 300 shots)&mdash;Sticking with the 4-stars. Solid little camera.&ndash;Wifi does NOT work with Marshmallow on Nexus 6p (tried everything, including customer service walk-through, this is apparently a known issue, may be fixed eventually, who knows?&ndash;Excellent focusing in low light, resolution very nice (I shoot DSLR, film, and medium format film, for background)&ndash;On paper, I didn&rsquo;t like the battery life, but realized that it&rsquo;s fine for the way I&rsquo;m using THIS camera. Charge lasted about 270 shots, but didn&rsquo;t lose power over time when sitting unused&ndash; so I didn&rsquo;t have to swap it out for seven weeks, which was terrific.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-END OF UPDATE&mdash; (original review below)I truly want to love this camera, and in some ways it&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted, but I&rsquo;m still within the return window and still waffling- here&rsquo;s why&hellip;Background:Semi-pro photographer, several DSLRs, desperately seeking &ldquo;purse-cam&rdquo; for work commute when I have no secure place to store larger gear. Over the past several years I&rsquo;ve bought (and then sold or returned) several four-thirds cameras &amp; large-sensor compacts.My priorities, roughly in order of importance, are:#1 image quality (of course), RAW capture, image stabilization, full manual, flash, Wifi, small, decent battery life, at least some zoom capability, and I really, really wanted a viewfinder. PLUS, I cringe when the price inches over $5-600. (Yeah, yeah, I KNOW I&rsquo;m dreaming&hellip;)The G9x doesn&rsquo;t have a viewfinder, but it&rsquo;s a perfect size at a lower-than-average price for this category of camera.Pros:IMAGE QUALITY. I&rsquo;m a ridiculously exacting pixel-peeper and I can live with the results, which is saying a LOT. I&rsquo;d have no problem at all printing 8x10s or even 16x20s from this sensor/camera.IQ, part 2: In Auto mode, the camera does a good job not blowing out my highlights. Minimal chromatic aberation, only in difficult conditions (pine needles at distance silhouetted against a bright blue sky), only visible when pixel-peeping (very zoomed in).I&rsquo;m not seeing any softness in the corners, either, unless I&rsquo;m shooting very wide &amp; deep, in which case the corners are naturally out of focal plane.SIZE. Not super-mini, which honestly I find difficult to handle after 40+ years with SLRs &amp; medium format cameras, but small enough for purse, back, or pocket, no problem.TOUCH SCREEN. This wasn&rsquo;t a concern until I purchased my most recent DSLR, when I discovered how useful they are. Optional touch to focus and touch to shoot, and it makes reviewing photos an absolute breeze.ERGONOMICS. I&rsquo;ve seen complaints about the placement of the playback/image review button and the video record button making them easy to depress accidentally. I&rsquo;ve had no issue with either. All the buttons are slightly depressed, as usual, and none touch-sensitive (capacitive). I appreciate both of those being one-touch function buttons.FLASH: This particular pop-up design seems much less frangible than the unfolding, robotic-looking extender brackets. I like the textured switch to release it, and don&rsquo;t care that it doesn&rsquo;t tip to bounce. Canon does a great job with exposure compensation and fill flashes on P&amp;S cameras, anyway.PLAYBACK BUTTON: When the camera is off, pushing the playback button turns it on without opening/extending the lensCANON&rsquo;S TYPICALLY INTUITIVE MENUS: I may have opened the manual once. Maybe. Until the Wifi issue, anyway, at which point the manual didn&rsquo;t matter.IN-CAMERA BATTERY CHARGING: see minor cons for more.Minor Cons:NO DELETE BUTTON. This will sound nit-picky, but I prefer the convenience of a physical delete button, press once to delete- press again to confirm. While a touch screen greatly simplifies photo review functions, deleting one photo still requires pressing the Quick Menu button, moving your hand to touch Delete onscreen, then move again &amp; touch to confirm.NOT GREAT BATTERY LIFE. Low end of this category camera, around 200 shots per charge. BUT- you can charge in-camera with a USB cable (with a common NON-proprietary micro USB cable) and aftermarket batteries are 20 bucks a pop.Possible Durability ISSUE: The little door over the HDMI &amp; USB ports doesn&rsquo;t seem like it will stand up to excessive wear.Potential Deal Breakers:LIMITED RAW FUNCTIONALITY: I can&rsquo;t shoot RAW in Auto modes???? Seriously, Canon? Why the hell not? Granted, I shoot manual about three-quarters of the time, but this is a P&amp;S camera! Ease, convenience, speed! There&rsquo;s ZERO reason to block RAW capture in Auto modes. I&rsquo;m pinning my hopes on someone at Canon coming to their senses and shooting out a firmware update before I&rsquo;m forced to hack it myself.WIFI: Canon Connect won&rsquo;t work with Lollipop 5, and apparently I&rsquo;m not alone in this. I have a Nexus 6p, but I gather it&rsquo;s not limited to my phone. Read online reviews first to see if this will be an issue for you, too. If I can&rsquo;t get the camera to cooperate with the Nexus, my old HTC, or my Surface Pro, this will probably be what pushes me into a return, and returning to my quest for the perfect purse-cam.Neutral:CONTROL RING: Sorta superfluous with the touch-screen, but I appreciate the tactile quality and like the looks. Some people don&rsquo;t want &ldquo;clicky&rdquo; rings, but I&rsquo;m exactly the opposite. I&rsquo;ve been using it because I&rsquo;m used to a DSLR, but because the lens protrudes very little, using the control ring is slightly awkward. It&rsquo;s not necessary or in the way, though, so if you don&rsquo;t like it, you can just forget about it.Fun:STAR MODE- Time lapse for star trailsCREATIVE SHOT MODE- Applies a bunch of effects to one shot, quickly. You can chose between them or delete the group in one step.Additional info:Tamrac 3819 bag is too small.Tamrac 3584144 Express 4 Compact Zip (Pink) is perfect size, spare battery fits in secure pocket.PS- I WISH I got paid to review camera products, but I don&rsquo;t, and nobody sends me any free stuff, either..sniff, sniff</p>

<h5 id="i-am-glad-i-picked-it-up">I am glad I picked it up</h5>

<p>I own a dozen different point and shoot Canon powershot cameras. Mainly in the Elph line, but also the 510HS and SX700HS. When this G9X was announced, I decided to pre-order because of the reviews of the G7X, the 1 inch sensor, and the size. I also wanted to step up to more of a proper camera, and had been considering the S120. I have only had it a day, but comparing the photos it takes to the Elph and other cameras, I am glad I picked it up. It&rsquo;s small enough that I will use it and even though I usually always use the program mode even in the entry level powershot cameras because they tend to over expose and wash out the images in auto, the front wheel and different shooting modes on the G9X are also very useful and quick to learn to use. Great cameraUPDATE 11/1/15Have had a chance to use this camera now in a variety of different lighting conditions and even with a middle of the road field range I really like this camera. The raw and super fine images are exceptional compared to the lower priced powershot cameras. Impressed at the photos when reviewing them in original size mode in any image software with the detail that is captured. I am very satisfied with results I am getting with this camera. The larger sensor also seems to handle indoor and lower light situations better than my other lower cost powershot compacts.UPDATE 11/21/15Picked up a Canon EOS Rebel SL1 DSLR on a sale from Canon. It&rsquo;s an amazing camera. However, now seeing what an entry level DSLR can do, I am even more shocked at the results of the G9X, with about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> the sensor size. Shooting raw in both cameras, there are differences in the results, but there are more similarities in image quality. Big difference in portability. The 1&rdquo; sensor in the G9X does one heck of a job.</p>
