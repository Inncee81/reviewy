<h5 id="three-stars-for-camera-two-for-service">Three stars for camera, two for service.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I&rsquo;m changing my review because after posting the original, the seller took the extra step by promptly sending me a message and offered to send a replacement cam free of charge. They seem to have pretty good customer service and the video/audio quality of the cam is good for the price but the app and manual is still lacking (they said they were working on improving the latter). As others have mentioned, the app simply isn&rsquo;t the most user friendly and can be frustrating trying to playback video on your phone.My old review is below ~~~My first impression after taking this camera out of it&rsquo;s packaging.. FEELS CHEAP.Instruction manual print so tiny you&rsquo;ll practically need a magnifying glass to read it, and this coming from a nearsighted 20 year old. I&rsquo;ve tested the camera at night time so far, no complaints on video quality for the price and the audio actually seems quite good BUT the app you have to download in order to change dashcam settings and view footage of your cam is a headache. I originally just wanted a cheap cam with motion detection but the battery is only 150mAh so it&rsquo;s very short. Moreover, my cam in particular has multiple streaks of dead pixels in the from of a circle right in the center of the screen. Doesn&rsquo;t effect the video file but hopefully the unit doesn&rsquo;t fail in a week.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p> I bought this dash cam a few weeks ago and it arrived very quickly. I tried to read the manual/instructions that came with it but that was a fiasco! The English is horrendous, the grammar is very poor, the print is micro weenie, and not all features are covered. I knew I was alone. I performed a diligent online search to find an intelligible manual but to no avail. So, I made a go of it and tried to set it up in my car. I couldn’t get the screen to stop shutting off. It would shut down every 60 seconds. I had no idea how to find the menu other than through a spontaneous hit. And wifi? It was a nightmare trying to figure that out! I accidentally held the left side wheel/button for a few seconds and discovered that’s how it works. I took it from there and downloaded the app (took forever to figure out which one but I finally got it). I hated this dash cam so much that I contacted the seller. They sent me response emails with pictures on how to find a setting. It helped somewhat and along with that I figured it out after a lot (and I mean a lot) of trial and error. I actually found all the menu settings and learned how to work them. The biggest thing (or hurdle) to know is that when the dash cam is recording you cannot use the menu (red light flashing on screen and two blue lights flashing on side of unit). You must disengage the cable and then click the left side and carefully review the options that appear on the screen. I learned through online research to not use the motion detection feature because it results in multiple small video clips rather than a consistent one; yup, a better choice. I also finally figured out how to control the screen shutdown or standby mode. That drove me nuts at first and I was entirely unhappy. I was rather impressed, however, with how kind and courteous the seller was to me especially when I emailed them in such frustration about not understanding how to use the dash cam. They responded with kind emails and were genuinely helpful. I also told them I thought the reviews on Amazon were fake because there was no way this unit could get 100% 5-star ratings! How the heck can people figure this thing out?! They told me they were not fake. I felt beside myself. So, I used the dash cam a couple of days after I finally figured it out. I tucked the cable wires under the ceiling and dash and side door and plugged it into my cigarette lighter. I could not believe the visual on this thing! Absolutely excellent picture/screen resolution, I can read license plates super easy. I will try to attach some pics/videos. I like the idea I can use this on my iPhone, too, although I seldom do because of the burdensome settings. I will likely get more into that in the future and record and control from my iPhone. I was making a left-hand turn into my driveway from the main road yesterday and some freaking idiot in a super-fast sporty blue car passed me on the left at the same time trying to beat me to my turn. Freaking idiot. I got it on the web cam!!!! Ha! Anywayzzz&hellip;I was fully prepared at one point to ship this thing back to the seller with a frustrated and negative attitude but after listening to them via emails and spending more time on the dash cam setting it up and seeing what it can do I decided to give it a chance. The sellers also offered options for a return, which was rather nice. A couple of days later after using it in the front of the car I realized I also have a built-in cigarette lighter in the back of my car (Honda SUV CRV-EX). I can’t believe I purchased another one of these dash cams from the same seller! Yes, I did! I received it in barely two days and set it up in the back of my car to cover the rear view. Way easier to deal with this time around, for sure, and I absolutely love it!!!!!! I placed the micro SD 32GB cards in each one (Walmart purchase) and tested them and they run beautifully! So far, anyway. I hope they go for a long, long time to come. So, with all of that said I still don’t understand what all of the settings mean and the manual doesn’t even approach some of them (auto on/off with time choices??, for one example) but I am shocked that I went from absolute hatred and disgust of this dash cam to absolute love and enjoyment! I think, in part (a big part), if the seller were not so accommodating, patient, and did not offer me return and second sale options I may not have gone the distance and purchased two of these! They almost had a one-star rating from me but after I gave it the second chance I absolutely stand by a 5-star rating for both the product and the seller! And this review is absolutely for real! Two thumbs up!! Thank you very, very much indeed! 😊Vikcam Dash Cam, Dashbord Car Camera Recorder FHD 1080P with 2.45&rdquo; Screen and Sony Senor, 170 Wide Angle Lens Car DVR Built-In WiFi ,G-Sensor, WDR, Loop Recording and Supreme Night VisionREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-build-quality-and-picture-quality">Great Build Quality and Picture Quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I was looking for a good dashcam and stumbled upon this one right here and decided to order it. Overall, I am very impressed with what this little guy can do.Let’s start out by talking about the build quality. This camera is built fairly well with the plastic feeling nice and premium. The screen on the camera is also really good, showing you a great display of what it is recording. The power cable, which connects to your car’s outlet, also feels like a solid cable that can take some bending. The two mounts that the camera comes with feel very sturdy and fit snugly where they should. What I am trying to get at here is that, despite being competitively priced, this definitely feels like an expensive product.However, you’re buying a camera to be a camera, so let’s talk about how well it does that. Thankfully, very well. The camera sensor is pretty high quality and records some good video that it will automatically delete after a set amount of time. This is good as you only need one SD card to store all the data and it will get rid of whatever you don’t need. For example, you don’t need footage of the 8 months of perfect driving, just the 5 minutes before an accident, so the camera handles that memory management for you.Overall, this is a really solid dashcam for your money. It does pretty much everything it sets out to do and does it all pretty well. I’d give this camera a solid buy if you’re looking for dashcams but don’t want to spend a huge amount of money.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this product, the screen is clear, it connects straight to your phone and it starts recording right away. The resolution of the camera is bright and clear, you can see every little detail on the outside. It&rsquo;s starts as soon as you open the car door and it turns off once you turn the car off all automatically, you do not have to attach any cables to the car only the charger. Having a dash cam is a great way to protect yourself while driving in case of an accident and it&rsquo;s simple to setup and use.READ MORE</p>
