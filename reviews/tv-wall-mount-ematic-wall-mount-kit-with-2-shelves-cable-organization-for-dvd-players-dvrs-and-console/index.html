<p>Shelves are over 1&rdquo; smaller in both directions.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-install">Easy to install!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was very easy to install and looks great!In the photo, it&rsquo;s off center due to there being an air duct in the wall. :(Also it&rsquo;s too small for a PS4. But that&rsquo;s ok, the Blu-Ray player I want will fit just fine.</p>

<h5 id="decent-serious-design-flaw-could-be-dangerous-around-a-toddler">Decent, Serious Design Flaw ( Could be dangerous around a toddler)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this when I revamped my sons room for his sony blueray player and his playstation. The install was pretty easy after finding a stud in the wall to mount it on. The shelves went together with ease as well. Lets talk about the shelves though. They tend to loosen over time for no apparent reason. I am always checking it and tightening the adjuster screws. I do believe it&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s made. Having a shelf that is completely supported by a central locking mechanism only and is this wide is just simple physics&hellip; A push down on the left or right of the glass shelf will, over time, start to loosen the screw. That in itself is a safety issue for me. He is only 10 so if the shelf starts to dump and I am not around , its going to be bad. It may hurt my son and /or even damage the expensive electronics that sit on it. He has learned to be very gentle with it when changing out Blue rays or Game discs but Imagine a toddler doing the same&hellip;Not good, folks. I have had no other issues than that. It has been in his room for almost a year now and its fine. Just DO NOT throw away the allen wrench because you will need it again. If I had to pick another shelf for his room I honestly would shop around some more. Basically, it does its job but I wouldn&rsquo;t buy another one.Thank you for reading and I do hope this review will help someone. Be Safe &amp; Happy Shopping!!</p>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">DON&rsquo;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish you could provide a ZERO star rating, just know that&rsquo;s how I would rate this.The shelf itself is fine, but the attachment hardware is horrible. M6 lag screw with a hex head and a philips. For some unknown reason, the hole you have to insert the fastener through isn&rsquo;t large enough to put a socket through. So, the only way to attach this is with a screwdriver. Well, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to drive a lag screw 2&rdquo; into a stud with just a screw driver, even with the proper pre-drilled hole. Before I attempted to install the bracket, I pre-drilled, then drove the lag screw with my socket in hopes of making it easier to drive. I should have stopped right there, because at that point the hex head had already started to deform (yes I was using the proper 10mm socket). I attempted the install, started the top screw, then started the bottom, and I drove them as far as I could until the socket reached the outer hole. From there I attempted by hand, again as far as I could. I eventually had to resort to a drill driver on the lowest torque setting I could get to still drive the lag screw. Well&hellip; prior to getting the lag screw tight, the philips head stripped out. This happened on both bolts, leaving me with a shelf support that isn&rsquo;t secure to the wall and no real way to remove the bolts now.I attempted at first to drill out the larger hole, but even with a step bit, you don&rsquo;t have enough depth to work the bit through to open up the hole. I then attempted opening up by using a smaller bit and working it around the hole. I gave up on that, and went to the hardware store to purchase an extractor bit (which cost me as much as this shelf). That worked like a CHARM, and I got this piece of crap off my wall.Time to order something different, please don&rsquo;t waste your money on this. Even if you started with good fasteners, you have no way to drive them tight. The outer hole isn&rsquo;t large enough to get a socket through, and you can&rsquo;t buy wood screws large enough to properly secure this. Other seem to install just fine, but the hole diameter is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; smaller than the outer diameter of a 10mm socket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These shelves are not the size listed. They are 1&rdquo; smaller in depth and width.The bracket is solid and this is easy to install but can we talk about the shelves?They are, essentially, pieces of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; glass held on with ONE short screw at the back.Our amplifier hangs over the edge on this so we had to be creative and put some foam grip shelf liner under it so the amp wouldn&rsquo;t fall off.The glass shelves are just too insecure to make me feel good about this purchase.That one small <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; screw that goes into the frame at the back of the glass can break out if there is any downward movement on the glass at the front facing part.This is NOT a set to have where children will be around.I&rsquo;d suggest measuring very carefully your items that will be placed on these and then determine if there will be any overhang.As there are rubber bumpers that you can put on the frame to protect the glass shelves, they will help to keep the items level if there is any shaking.We have a huge NHT subwoofer directly underneath this. When the subwoofer was against the wall that the shelves were mounted to, it made the shelving unit vibrate. We moved the sub further away and there was no more shaking. Good thing we don&rsquo;t live in an earthquake zone&hellip;If I had to purchase another shelving unit, I&rsquo;d choose a different one.</p>

<p>Comes with 3 shelves but we only used 2 of them. Cords drive me crazy and it hides them all nicely. It was easy to install with one person; I did not have to assist my husband at all ( and he did not cuss at all during installation).</p>
