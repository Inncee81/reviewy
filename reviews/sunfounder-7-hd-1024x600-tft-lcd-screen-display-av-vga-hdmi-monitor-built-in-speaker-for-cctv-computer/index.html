<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="first-impressions-decent-with-a-couple-of-annoyances">First Impressions: Decent with a couple of annoyances</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lightweight plastic, to be expected. Screen attaches to the stand with knobs, like a camera to a tripod; that was nice. Screen is bright and readable, though I would only want to do so for specific purposes (I need a monitor I can quickly move around and swap for checking that programs are still running on various systems). Swapping to HDMI after plugging in just required push of a single button.- Minus one star for having a long S-Video cable permanently attached to the monitor; this has to be hidden. I chose to zip-tie it to the power cord.- Minus one star for having the words 7 INCH HD TFT COLOR MONITOR permanently emblazoned across the top of the monitor, like in the main picture. If that were a good idea, I would have REFRIGERATOR on my fridge, OVEN on my oven, and WIFE tattooed on my wife&rsquo;s forehead. You know, just so I didn&rsquo;t get them confused. If this was needed for marketing purposes, why oh why isn&rsquo;t it a removable sticker?UPDATE: bumped up a star because they seem to have removed the permanent text from the monitor. My wife is greatly relieved.</p>

<h5 id="this-little-monitor-works-great-with-my-raspberry-pi-3">this little monitor works great with my Raspberry Pi 3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving this 5 stars, but there are some strange &ldquo;design&rdquo; choices that were made here.First, this little monitor works great with my Raspberry Pi 3. Worked out of the box.Pros:Small footprintComes with an adjustable base stand and optional adhesive mounting tapeCan be mounted to a wall tooAV/HDMI/VGA/S-Video inputsRemote controlCons:Not really usable if you intend to actually program with this monitor. Just a little too small to have readable text unless you&rsquo;re strictly using the command line and can adjust the font size.Bizarre and puzzling design choice:The S-Video cable is hard wired. Since I didn&rsquo;t need S-Video for my project I just cut it off.The words &ldquo;7 INCH HD TFT COLOR MONITOR&rdquo; are literally printed on the monitors frame. That&rsquo;s not a sticker in the photos, it&rsquo;s literally printed onto the monitor. I used a little fine steel wool and it comes off relatively easy.</p>

<h5 id="nice-little-monitor-for-vacation">nice little monitor for vacation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed that the product description is missing information you need. Yes this will plug right into your Raspberry PI, But I got it for use with CHIP which is a brand new product. It will use RCA plugs or HDMI which it comes with an HDMI and long RCA plug in is hard wired to the unit along with what looks like a power adapter to use in a car&rsquo;s lighter and wires so it can be wired directly into your car&rsquo;s power supply so can be used with on board cameras. It can be plugged into a wall with the sullied power adapter as well. The screen is a rather small one but still nice for my uses such as away camping when I go on vacation. It will be a good little monitor for when I start testing the capabilities of this new computer which I don&rsquo;t have quite yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-expected-wish-there-was-micro-usb-for-power-instead-of-ac-adapter">Works as expected, wish there was micro-USB for power instead of AC adapter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this between my various Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s that I have setup around the house when I need to direct input on the device, which is rare. No issues connecting up, but the HDMI has a lot of static and background noise, so I have to turn the volume all the way down. Not sure if that is the Pi&rsquo;s doing that, or if it&rsquo;s the display. The display tilts very nice, so even if the display is sitting way below where I am standing, I can adjust it so I don&rsquo;t have to strain myself to see the display. Comes with an HDMI cable too, which is nice. Although, I wish that this was powered via micro USB instead of its AC adapter. Not sure if that is even possible, but would be nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-but-remove-the-stupid-car-av-cable">Excellent! (But remove the stupid car AV cable)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So! This is a very cool little monitor. I needed a monitor to connect to a headless server for troubleshootingg from time to time, and didn&rsquo;t have a lot of space to store it when it was not in use. So this monitor is perfect for that. I use HDMI input and love the way the picture looks.I am giving it five stars for price and overall quality and cuteness even though, like others, I hate the video cable that is sticking out of the case as a car video connection. (A cable bundle provided connects to this, and from there to AV and power I guess.) Before I even turned the thing on for the first time, I opened up the case by removing two back corner screws and the four screws on the bracket (not sure I had to remove the bracket). The back cover then snacks out. I think had to remove four small screws on the circuit board to access the white connector that joined the stupid car video cable to the unit. I pulled the plug, and it was gone! I put it back together, and plugged in HDMI and it was awesome. I kept the cable in case I ever want to put this in a car &ndash; unlikely. I think the cable should plug into the monitor then go about its car-related business.The other minor thing I don&rsquo;t like is it says &ldquo;7 INCH MONITOR&rdquo; on the top in dorky font. What is the purpose of that? I know it&rsquo;s a 7&rdquo; monitor. I could put black tape on that, but who cares.So, recommended, but be prepared to surgically remove the stupid car AV cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-c-power-supply-not-u-l-certified">A/C POWER SUPPLY NOT U.L. CERTIFIED!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The A/C power supply included in this display BROKE as I tried to remove the plug from the wall outlet. One of the power prongs actually BROKE OFF, and remained hanging out of the wall outlet! A very dangerous situation. There is NO WAY IN THE WORLD that the A/C power supply supplied with this monitor is UL certified. Therefore, it is potentially both a shock and a fire hazard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="after-5-minutes-of-operation-the-screen-showed-nothing-but">After 5 minutes of operation the screen showed nothing but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 5 minutes of operation the screen showed nothing but a sort of line-y static. Futzing with it, I can get it to display&hellip; but having to futz with it makes me think that it&rsquo;s going to break more seriously sooner than otherwise. It was mailed to me with stickers covering the serial and model number, so I can&rsquo;t set up the squaretrade claim / insurance.Edit: Coming back to it later, yep.. It&rsquo;s still terrible. Spend your money on a thing that works.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-10-screen-would-be-better-for-a-development-environment">A 10&rdquo; screen would be better for a development environment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The display works well. Documentation is weak, and didn&rsquo;t cover the initial mode for screen-flip (horizontal and vertical), which caused some initial confusion. The display is a little small, with the terminal screen text size being just at the limits of readability. A 10&rdquo; screen would be better for a development environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Neat screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen brightness is too low</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars-1">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sent it back. Too small for my liking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-monitor-for-my-raspberrypi">A great monitor for my RaspberryPi</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great monitor for my RaspberryPi, just plug in and it worked great. Cones with starter guide and its made well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poorly-thought-out-design-low-build-quality">Poorly-thought-out design, low build quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I unpacked it, there was a packing material on the screen <em>under the bezel</em> that is impossible to remove.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="screen-looked-nice-and-was-very-compact">Screen looked nice and was very compact</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen looked nice and was very compact, in fact it was a lot smaller than I thought and ended up returning it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding">Outstanding</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally got a 7&rdquo; screen that works out of the box for Pi 3 and anything else I have tried it with. Just got it today.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-what-it-should">Does what it should</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheap appearance and feel. Must mount, very unstable. Does what it supposed to though and has a good price for what it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-screen-cheap-results">Cheap screen cheap results</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stopped accepting HDMI input after first day had annoying hum from speakers</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hd-video-at-the-smallest-size-great">HD Video, at the smallest size!! Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked it! Very practical, you can connect it to your IoT HDMI ports anywhere (Raspberry PI 3, Arduino, etc). It did what we need it, the operating system recognized it, smoothly.</p>
