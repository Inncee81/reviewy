<h5 id="from-personal-home-theater-to-personal-home-imax-theater">From personal home theater to personal home IMAX theater.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If my previous 72&rdquo; screen was like having the movie theater at my house, then this 120&rdquo; is like having IMAX at my house!!! (relatively speaking of course)Just stunning. Movies, games, &amp; sports are just massive on this thing. I&rsquo;ve always kept a 50&rdquo; HDTV in the same room so I don&rsquo;t burn up all my lamp hours on my projector for just my &lsquo;casual&rsquo; gaming and &lsquo;casual&rsquo; sports watching. But with this new screen, it&rsquo;s getting much harder to do that.Best screen for the money anywhere. The material and construction are quality. Don&rsquo;t let the price fool you. I would highly recommend for any home theater enthusiast looking to upgrade as I did. Yes, Elite Screens is a quality brand if you were wondering like I was. I can testify to that now.I&rsquo;ve had this for a month now. I just love the manual slow retract feature. This helps a lot because I have this hanging from a 9&rsquo; high ceiling. It has retracted successfully each time for the past month, no hangups or getting stuck. And it will lock into place at any level you want it, not just preset positions. The feature works very well. The smell isn&rsquo;t that bad and is nothing funky or anything&hellip;it&rsquo;s just the factory smell of fresh vinyl. It doesn&rsquo;t fill the room. It goes away after a few minutes and only comes back after fully retracting and un-retracting again. Seriously, not really a big deal. It gets less and less with time.Again, this was an upgrade to my current home theater setup and I had already sworn off going to local theaters with my old screen, except for 1 or 2 summer blockbusters. Now this has really kept me from the local cineplex for another thousand years!</p>

<h5 id="package-came-pretty-beat-up">Package came pretty beat up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Package came pretty beat up, I suppose that is the fault of the shipper not Elite Screens, though if it is going to get such rough treatment maybe better packaging might help.The screen however was trouble. After installation, pulled the screen down and it did not retract much more than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way. Googled it, not much luck. Contacted support, which you have to do with an e-mail form. A day later they emailed me back saying I would need to retension the spring. A brand new screen should not need to be retensioned, it should be done at the factory. This unfortunately requires taking the screen down and taking it apart. Alas the instructions had no diagram and were somewhat confusing. There are about a hundred promotional videos on you tube for Elite Screens but none showing how this was done. After two tries I was successful, it is a moderately tricky operation to do, but glad I could do it rather than send it back as shipping something like this is an ordeal in itself.Now it works but the operation is anything but smooth and the slow return really doesn&rsquo;t seem slow at all. Maybe too much tension in the spring but I wound it the number of times specified. Not super anxious to take it down and do it all over again.As others have noted there are some waves in the screen when unrolled, I don&rsquo;t know if all screens are like that or just this one. You notice it when you pan over landscapes or such.I am keeping it since the installation of another screen would also be a headache, but I can&rsquo;t say I am so happy about it.</p>

<h5 id="schweet">Schweet!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Goes up and down with ease and looks great with my new Optoma short throw 1080 3D projector. Got this for under $200 and it looks about as good as the $3000 screen (maybe better as it&rsquo;s a lot bigger) than the screen I saw at one the the remaining big box stores that sells such things. Yes the edges are a bit wavy but that&rsquo;s what you get with a roll-up screen. No big deal for me as the show you are watching should be so good you don&rsquo;t notice such little things. However, if you don&rsquo;t like the show you are watching, that little wave will drive you nuts, lol! It&rsquo;s quicker to watch something you like than to fix the wave. When viewing 4K thru Youtube via my laptop that isn&rsquo;t even 4K, it certainly looks very close to 4K in a dark room - very impressive! Things have certainly improved a lot in home theater performance since they came out over a decade ago. Got this, the projector and all the cables for under $1K. Schweet!</p>

<h5 id="best-features-you-didn-t-know-you-needed">Best features you didn&rsquo;t know you needed&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s not much difference in the actual screen surface from brand to brand, they&rsquo;re probably all made in the same factory, but I love the slow, soft, auto close feature on this screen. I didn&rsquo;t know I wanted it until I read how well this screen reviewed, so I tried it. Because I&rsquo;ve mounted it high on the wall of our barn, the auto close feature makes closing the screen as easy as a quick tug on the handle and you walk away as it closes. It ensures there&rsquo;s no snap back to damage the mechanism, no loud bang, and no slam to knock it loose or against the wall.I used this with a 500 lumen travel projector on a sunny afternoon to watch the Wisconsin Badgers win to get to the Final Four. 30+ Badger fans were there, so the pressure was on to perform, and it worked very well.Another bonus is it&rsquo;s opacity, or ability to block out ANY light from behind it. I was able to mount it over some windows and it did double duty as the screen AND window shade.I can&rsquo;t compare this screen to other screens with my projector (moderate brightness, most home theater projectors put out 1000+ lumens) but it looks so much brighter and sharper than projecting on a wall or sheet that it&rsquo;s WELL WORTH the price of the screen to help your projector shine. I can only imagine how good it would look with a theater projector!I worried about the curl on the edges that some reviewers complained about, but most of the curl relaxed after a while, and you never think of it again. I suppose you might focus on it a little more if you&rsquo;re stuck watching the same kids movie with your daughters&hellip; that&rsquo;s about when I start looking for missing pixels on my flat screen!</p>
