<h5 id="without-question-sony-s-best-mp3-player-to-date">Without Question, Sony&rsquo;s Best Mp3 Player To Date</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Without doubt, this is Sony&rsquo;s best mp3 player to date, excluding, of course, the hideous expensive and physically heavy Android-based &ldquo;ZX&rdquo; models. I&rsquo;ve owned so many Sony mp3 players over the years that it is difficult to keep track of all of them. Some of the older models came with a startlingly effective noise reduction system, but you were stuck using Sony&rsquo;s proprietary &ldquo;Sonic Stage&rdquo; software which made any interaction with loading or unloading music more tedious than one could imagine. But many of these players were truly excellent, and many were ground-breaking, being far ahead of any other manufacturer when it came to portable digital music technology (first OLED screen, first integrated active noise reduction system, ATRAC encoding, etc.).Late this past year, I purchased the Sony NWZ-A17 Hi-Res player to get the advantages of the Hi-Res technology, and also because it not only came with 64Gb of on-board storage, but also because it had a micro sdxc slot, so, with a 200mb card, you could get your storage up to about a quarter of a terabyte. The sound was great, the problems with Sonic Stage were removed, the unit weighed only 50g, and it sounded fantastic. My only gripe? No noise reduction like some of the older Sony models I had.Well, with the introduction of the NWA26HNLM, we have that noise reduction, and few other things, to boot. I have to say, and this is coming from a person who has experience with almost every mp3 player Sony has ever made, that this player&rsquo;s sound is so good that is unbelievable. The noise reduction, already perfected in earlier Sony iterations, has been extended further, with customizable settings for the noise reduction, including strength, and even TYPE of noise you want eliminated, plus an auto-sense function to sample that noise and reverse noise in different settings.This unit sounds so good, looks so good, and is so well built (the case is made of a solid piece of aluminum) that it is, in my own mind, without question, the best mp3 player Sony has ever put out. The included earphones, which work in tandem with the active noise reduction circuitry, are astoundingly good sounding, and, if you care about such things, just look great. This is a physically beautiful device, even better looking in real life than the photos here (I&rsquo;ll see if I can post some of my own photos in the near future to demonstrate what I mean).Yes, it&rsquo;s not cheap. But for a little over 300 dollars, you get a device that can hold 32Gb + 200Gb of files, uses all the Hi-Res circuitry that Sony has been releasing in the past two years (&ldquo;Hi-Res&rdquo; is not hype; do yourself a favor and look into what Sony puts into their Hi-Res models, and how they differ from tradition models, and the overall topic of high resolution sound recordings that far surpass that of CD-ROMs), puts out sound that I would rate as the best I&rsquo;ve heard, looks great, and still only weight about 60g (including the headphones).I will try to expand this review over time, but for now, let me list some plusses and minuses:++ Superb sound quality++ Utilizes Hi-Res circuitry to reproduce sound all the way to 24 bit/192 kHz, far beyond that of a CD-ROM++ Outstanding, customizable noise reduction that is STARTLINGLY effective++ It may not be publicized, but there is a &ldquo;Quiet Mode,&rdquo; which engages the noise reduction without playing any music. Cool!++ Headphones that are capable of working with the Hi-Res technology and the noise reduction to achieve great sound, and stay in place, too!++ Hi quality mechanical build utilizing a unibody aluminum build++ Gorgeous physical appearance, and available in about six colors++ Physically lightweight++ Works well with both Windows and Mac machinesMinuses&ndash; Pricey&ndash; Only 32Gb on-board memory; my A17 has 64Gb (you can purchase the 64Gb w/ noise reduction only in silver or black in the U.S. at this time)&ndash; Sony proprietary USB cable (not as big of an issue as it used to be, but you have to keep track of it)&ndash; Only USB 2.0 (!) transfer speed (it is true that you are likely to load your micro sdxc card with your computer, making this a moot point, but you still have to connect via USB to load the on-board memory, and with these storage amounts (and the price) why doesn&rsquo;t this (and all expensive Sony MP3 players, including their top-of-the-line &ldquo;ZX&rdquo; series Android-based players) have USB 3.0 connections???&ndash; For some inscrutable reason (copyright?), will not play WMA lossless files, nor will any of the most expensive Sony players, including those in the +$1,000 range (but it plays every other lossless format, plus, of course, all the Hi-Res files, which is the aim of this device to begin with)This is the player I&rsquo;ve been waiting for Sony to build for years. It&rsquo;s finally here, and with features and capabilities beyond what I could have ever expected. It&rsquo;s worth every penny, and is certainly a five star item. Actually, its much higher than that. One try, and you&rsquo;ll be hooked.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-ipod">Better Than iPod</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Background: Exclusively used iPod digital player, since that is what Hubby got me for a present one year &amp; I stuck with it (and even &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; the player at one point). However, iPod music players of a convenient size are going away, so I searched for a high capacity replacement, since I LOVE listening to music.It takes some getting used to this, after using only an iPod (I used a cassette Walkman before that!), but I am actually very much loving this convenient size, large capacity digital music player. I have a lot of music, but I haven&rsquo;t filled up all the capacity, yet!The software MediaGo, which is what this Walkman uses, took a little getting used to also, but I have switched from iTunes to using the MediaGo exclusively for my music playing, on my PCs as well as this Walkman.The color is vivid and shiny and pretty.Once I learned how to navigate the device, it is pretty easy for me to select my music and go about my day. I am very pleased with this Sony Walkman.The only &ldquo;Con&rdquo; I can think of is not being able to directly &ldquo;delete&rdquo; music from the device&ndash; it has to be plugged into the computer and you have to use the MediaGo software.Pros:IT PLAYS MUSIC!!!Great size that can easily fit a pocket (jeans or a men&rsquo;s flannel shirt, because let&rsquo;s face it, &ldquo;they&rdquo; don&rsquo;t make women&rsquo;s pockets for anything useful!).Beautiful color.Bluetooth ability and audio plug.Fairly easy to navigate through music with several options for selecting music (album, artist, genre; easily scroll using 0-Z, which allows for quickly finding what is wanted).Can use the audio plug to connect with my car and then can use headphones when I&rsquo;m not in my car, so I get to take my music with me everywhere!It&rsquo;s not bulky.It&rsquo;s not overloaded with distractions.It&rsquo;s simple to operate.I recommend Sony&rsquo;s Hi-Res Walkman Digital Player for those who want the simplicity of just music!</p>

<h5 id="audiophile-s-heaven-achieved">Audiophile&rsquo;s Heaven Achieved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my third model of Sony digital walkman and does not disappoint. I use the Sony Media Go app to burn Hi-Res FLAC versions of cd&rsquo;s and seamlessly load them up. After a headphone break-in period and finding the correct size ear adapters, the sound is incredible with the provided earbuds. Noise cancelling is average, but adjustable and apt. I am 71 inches tall and the cable is about 6&rdquo; too short to have the unit in my pocket with the wired phones. Cutting the cord, the bluetooth and proprietary LDAC connection with my Sony MDR-100ABN wireless cans (also awesome) was troublesome at first with skipping the music or just locking up. I finally realized that I needed to turn off the audio bluetooth connection of my phone that was simultaneously connecting with the headphones (while connected with the walkman). The LDAC connection and the adjustment of settings with the walkman makes for glorious, less-compressed wired-like sound. More than enough settings and options to adjust sound quality just right for any discerning ears. Sony continues to lead the industry with great audio products, and the latest walkman satisfies this audiophile.</p>
