<h5 id="great-value">GREAT VALUE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely loved this camera! This is a true needle in a hay stack. I am not a techy person, and this was so easy to use. I assumed my husband would have to of shown me how to use it; however, I pretty much opened it and it was ready to go. The screen and buttons every where, all clearly labeled, and so light so easy to use. This camera even worked great in low light. Using for a candle/cake blowing celebration while lights were off.. everything still looked great! I would recommend a neck cable with this, just to avoid dropping, and mom annoying you with being careful not to drop. Otherwise this was the cat&rsquo;s meow of great deals. The zoom from across a field was amazing and very easy to hold hand steady, and get a clear not shaky picture. While close you can blow it up so big, and it was clear as a bell! I bought for a birthday party to keep a video, and my 12 year old, has now started making you tube videos. She picked it up, and was clear how to use right away. It was easy to save where I was at, and to continue where I left, there was no cuts in the middle. the hand holder was perfect for an adult and down to a 5 year old. The electronic components all appear to be high enough quality it should last long term. I feel the price was a great value, and would for sure recommend this camera, especially as a gift as it looks super nice even packaged well! I feel it is probably under priced, and glad this is the model I choose!</p>

<h5 id="i-like-this-camcorder">I like this camcorder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this camcorder&hellip; nowadays most decent smartphones, can do a good or even better job in a photo or video shooting, I agree that they are versatile but not &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; for doing a specific or targeted task. You may end up in finding a video in lots of your own pictures, videos and selfies, etc.I bought this to do some video reviews, which fulfil the requirements easily and do it good and right. It has a tripod mount hole that I can mount it to my tripod and adjust the height and angle.The LCD touchscreen and be flipped out, turned 180 degrees towards the object being recorded so that if I am the object being recorded, I know how I positioned in the footage.It does come with a battery but mine had a bit of charge so I did put it to charge right after testing the cam. It will store date/time so that you can tell when the video has been taking. It comes with all needed cables. The camera also has an incredible night vision so taking video at night is still nice and clear.Nevertheless, simple to operate, but with all the necessary features and functions, and the final is, I get my HD video review</p>

<h5 id="anti-shake-works-perfectly-portable">Anti-Shake works. Perfectly portable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camcorder is great as a portable and easy to carry around recording device. As you might have already told by the low price, the camcorder is not boasting about the quality of the pictures it captures. I am using an iPhone and the resolution difference is apparent. The reason I bought this camcorder is because that there are several advantages to record using a single purpose device like this instead of a smart phone. The safety tether attached on the body gives not only flexibility for us to move around, but also release us from the worries of dropping the device accidentally. On the contrary, smart phones are more designed to browse the internet and utilize various applications. The camera is just for posting, not recording, at least nor long time recording. The camcorder also has a really decent recording time. Like mentioned in the description, the camcorder could last 2.5 hours of recording. Lastly, although not expected, I did find that the camcorder has some extra features that could make the user experience even higher, such as face capture, anti-shaking, etc.All in all, this is definitely for those who enjoys recording for a family event that is constantly moving around for a while.By the way, it did come with a storage pouch, but no storage card. It is required to get a SD card to start recording, not having a built-in memory unit.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-it-been-wanting-to-try-this-and-finally-i">I love it been wanting to try this and finally I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> never regret buying this one , I love it been wanting to try this and finally I decided to try and it really has a good camera and video quality for only $55 bucks only . It has a little bag which is so handy and a strap where u can put your hand and won&rsquo;t slip through your hand it&rsquo;s so cool I love it ☺️☺️ Very fast shipping.. I would recommend buying this one</p>

<h5 id="great-to-have">Great to Have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice camcorder for the price. Films in HD which is very nice, and looks great on a bigger screen. Very easy to use, my kids could even use it. I got this so I can film Youtube videos easier without having to use my computer all the time. I like that you can turn the LCD screen around so you can see what you are filming, comes in handy for selfie videos. Its great that it comes with a case, so you can put it in your bag for when you are on the go. easy to charge. Great beginner camcorder. The only thing I wish is that it had a lens cover. Other then that this is a great camcorder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightweight-and-just-right-size">Lightweight and just right size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camcorder meet my expectation.It could be held by one hand and operate easily.I am able to reach each buttons with my small hand since the just right size and position.One of the features that I pretty love, is the 270 degree rotation LED screen which make selfie so convenient. The fill lights are bright enough in dark too.Easy to watch while taking video in multiple angles, such as higher than my head.The camcorder automatically turn on/off when open/close the screen.I think It could be much better if it supported 64GB or higher.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality">Poor quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camcorder before I went on vacation and I opened it up only to find the camera quality was very poor, it is not the 1080p that they claim.</p>
