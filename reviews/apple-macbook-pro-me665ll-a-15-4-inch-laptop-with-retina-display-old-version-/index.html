<h5 id="from-an-ex-pc-junkie">From an ex-PC junkie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used PC&rsquo;s since the day I was born. As an avid gamer, I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Asus or Alienware branded laptops. That being said, my three year old Alienware m11x R1 saw it&rsquo;s last days after a fatal screen hinge problem. The LCD screen doesn&rsquo;t turn on anymore and Dell refuses to answer my calls or emails.As a college student, it was imperative that I found a replacement laptop within the two weeks of mine dying. I wanted to get something with a bigger screen but also portability. It also had to be something that would keep me from gaming (this is what happens when you&rsquo;re a science major). Looked around at a lot of other PCs. Then I decided to go to the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; and give Apple a try. Testing out a MBP for the first time was probably one of the best technological experiences I&rsquo;ve had. Everything seems so intuitive and easier to learn. You can get more done quickly using gestures or commands on a Mac. This was one of its greatest selling points to me along with the build quality. When you pick a Mac up, it feels solid. Nothing rattles or makes cracking noises, and the design is so clean and minimal. I was sold after my first test run&hellip; then I found out there was a retina option. This display is incomparable to anything else. The images look sharper than real life! After being sold to the computer, I got sold to the amazing screen resolution. Not to mention how much THINNER this Mac is than its predecessors. It weighs the same amount as a regular MBP 13&rdquo;!I&rsquo;ve had so many friends keep their Macs for more than 5 years at a time. And it&rsquo;s usually because they want to upgrade to a better model. For a PC user, that&rsquo;s insane. Three years of use is enough to make your computer a veteran. You usually have to replace it because of all the viruses or issues with hardware. So, in essence, I feel that the money invested in a Mac is well spent. I&rsquo;d rather have a quality machine that will survive the test of time and get me through the rest of my undergraduate and graduate school career than get a cheaper, new PC that will need to be replaced in another three years. Granted, PCs have a much more open platform and more freedom, but the quality of PC products just doesn&rsquo;t compare to Apple. If PC companies can take that into consideration, I&rsquo;d be sold to their newest product.On the actual usage side, I have to warn you that some programs have still yet to be &ldquo;retina optimized&rdquo;. Text and graphics will look pixelated on some windows. Microsoft office was like this until they released a patch. The text is still pixelated, but it&rsquo;s not enough to gripe over anymore. The 8GB RAM and solid state drive make running programs a breeze. I&rsquo;ve had 6 PDF articles open along with Photoshop CS6, Safari, Word, and iTunes open without any hitches.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is hands down my favorite purchase made on Amazon. I generally like to wait a long time to review large purchases such as this one to see how the product holds up over time. I have to say I&rsquo;m impressed with this computer. I purchased a refurbished 2012 Retina Macbook Pro 15 inch model from Marietta_Computers for what I&rsquo;d say is a steal! I got a model with 16GB of RAM and a quad-core i7 for less than a grand. Looks and works like pretty much brand new. I recall emailing this seller for pictures so that I could see what I was getting into, and they were quick to respond with large photos of the computer from many different angles. Overall I had a great experience and would likely purchase my next computer from them, might be a while though!</p>

<h5 id="very-impressed-with-this-laptop-screen-is-amazing">Very impressed with this laptop. Screen is amazing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this laptop based on all the praise it has received here on Amazon Reviews. Won&rsquo;t repeat what has been said over and over, but simply ratify that this is an amazing machine worth every penny. The retina display is so good it&rsquo;s hard to explain, I can only say you need to see to believe.Apple has really developed an amazing product that will certainly revolutionize the industry. This is the same way I felt when I switched to Mac buying the first generation macbook air and later with the first gen iPad.UPDATE: I felt compelled to write an update after a week of use. The more you use this retina display the more you get spoiled. You have no idea what you&rsquo;re missing with this display.I believe Apple has really nailed it in figuring out how to evolve computers. For the past 20 years everyone has focused on increasing processor speed, RAM and HDD size. Apple pushed the adoption of SSDs to deal with the performance bottleneck created by slow HDDs. Now they&rsquo;re pushing another major improvement with the display. What makes this amazing is the fact that my former MBP&rsquo;s display was already better than most notebooks I compared it to. The new retina display simply pushes the bar a lot higher.</p>

<h5 id="everybody-listen-up">Everybody Listen UP !!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep this short and to the point. I was going to buy a loaded Toshiba Qosmio in the fall of 2012. My old Alienware laptop was tired and had served me well. I game a lot, do graphics and push my laptops really hard. They must be versatile. My wife is an Apple girl. You know, iPad, iPhone, i this and i that. She says why don&rsquo;t yo get an Apple laptop so I will be familiar with it&rsquo;s OS. My next statement to her was, &ldquo; I can get the hottest thing out there for a $1,000.00 less.&rdquo; She replied that it may be hot but it won&rsquo;t be the best. OK, so I hit purchase now on Amazon and have never looked back. First Amazon as always was wonderful. Cheapest and quickest service anywhere and with second to none customer service. So my Macbook Pro Retina arrives and I am completely wowed by it&rsquo;s simple beauty and solid feel. You know you have a piece of quality hardware in your hands the moment you touch it. I purchase the Apple Care three year program so when I called to activate the Apple employees were beyond nice and helpful. It reminded me of the way things use to be. You know, people actually caring. Next I partitioned the hard drive with Apple&rsquo;s Bootcamp and loaded Windows 7 Home Premium for gaming. I kept the OSX Mountain Lion partition for work and graphics. OK here is the &ldquo;EVERYBODY LISTEN UP moment. I to this point have not found a thing this Apple can&rsquo;t do. Gaming has blown me away. I have played the entire Crysis series, Battlefield 3, the entire Bioshock series, numerous older games that have given reviewers problems on other set ups such as Crysis Maximum and most of the latest graphics hungry games like Bioshock Infinite. This laptop has flawlessly met every challenge I have given it bar none and at very high settings that most PCs couldn&rsquo;t handle. Very impressive. The Macbook is classy looking and feels like money. You know it&rsquo;s not a junker the moment you lay your eyes on it and when you touch it your sold. If you want the best this it. Yea it&rsquo;s expensive and so are BMWs. Drive either one and you will never go back.</p>
