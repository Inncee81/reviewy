<p>The Worx SD semi-automatic screwdriver includes 12 onboard bits in two automatically loading cartridges for the utmost in cordless convenience (view larger).</p>

<p>Its 4-volt maximum lithium-ion battery holds a charge for up to 18 months, so it&rsquo;s always ready to use (view larger).
Worx’s WX254L SD semi-automatic power screwdriver with 12 driving bits takes the convenience of cordless screwdriving applications to the next level thanks to its rapid-reloading technology that allows you to change bits with a single slide. Includes two sets of bit cartridges to interchange within the tool so bits never get lost and are always ready to load via its automatic bit-shift functionality. Ideal for the avid tool guru and DIYers alike, the WX254L is handy for use around the house to tighten loose screws on furniture, cabinetry, woodwork, and more. Plus, its 4-volt maximum lithium-ion battery holds its charge for months on end, so it’s always ready to use.</p>

<p>Undertake Tasks Fully Loaded
Never again fumble through a tool drawer or waste time trying to get the right bit to attach to your cordless screwdriver. The Worx SD semi-automatic screwdriver has two bit cartridges that hold a total of 12 bits at all times. Easily switch between the included Phillips, slotted, hex, square recess, and Torx bits by simply moving the screwdriver’s slide back and then forward to activate the auto bit shift to find the bit that best suits your need.</p>

<p>Bit by Bit with Just A Click
The SD’s automatic bit shift activates the bit in the cartridge. Simply open the slide, rotate the cartridge to the desired bit, and shut the slide to activate the bit. The two cartridges are preloaded with 12 bits, including a special screw-starting drill bit for making pilot holes. But any standard <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch hex screwdriving bit is compatible with the SD in case you have special screwdriving applications. It’s the ultimate combination of versatility and convenience.</p>

<p>A Charge That Lasts
The SD runs on a 4-volt maximum lithium-ion battery that, thanks to its advanced technology, can hold a charge for up to a year and a half. Eliminate the delay of starting a project because of a dead battery—you can pick up the SD after 18 months in storage and immediately tackle the project at hand with confidence knowing that it’s still ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-idea-but-some-serious-shortcomings">Great idea but some serious shortcomings.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This power screw driver is a great idea with the revolver style bit holder, but it lacks two critical features to make it truly useful.First, it is single speed with no variability, so it is just on or off. You can&rsquo;t slowly start and finish tightening a screw.Second, it has no torque limit adjustment like better quality power drivers, so it&rsquo;s very hard to fully tighten a screw without accidentally stripping it. This is particularly a problem when using a hex or torx bit, which will not naturally slip out when tight.Considering the cost of this driver, both these features should have been included.Additionally, the selection of bit sizes and types is poorly chosen. There are three different Phillips bit sizes but only one Slotted bit, which is very small. There are only two Torx bit sizes, T10 and T20, whereas a T15 is also a commonly used size. OTOH, there are two small Square bits, which are very rarely used and too small to be used as socket holders.On the positive side, it does use a lithium-ion battery that charges quickly and will hold a charge for a long time, and it is solidly made as are all WORX products.</p>

<h5 id="got-to-admit-this-is-awesome">Got to admit, this is awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This purchase was &ldquo;That is awesome, got to try it!&rdquo; So let me see if I can break it down. The drill:1. Packaging good, nice and simple2. Drill is small, not going to be a jobsite tool for sure.3. Bits are contained as advertised, not going to lose them. (two &ldquo;magazines&rdquo; full of bits comes with)4. Charging is done by plug in on both sides. Meaning the battery (as far as I can tell) is not removeable.5. No carrying case. But the tray in the box is surprisingly heavy duty, (seriously) I may leave it in there in my tool box.6. It does have a little LED light on the handle to illuminate a screw head.Some things to note, this little guy is not going to replace your big dog 18volt (insert big name cordless drill). This little guy, is going to put your doll house together, hang pictures, tighten screws, little odd jobs that the big drill just gets all up in the way with and to be frank, way to powerful to do in the first place. The Worx is hefty enough though. It does not feel cheap, it does have some weight to it. The handle is a little small for my hands, but will work. The slide is heavy duty plastic and slides in and out very smooth, no sticking, nor does it feel cheap.The RPM is way low, meaning the bit spins slow. Also there is no other speed. It will be easy to track and place on smaller projects and screws. The lock &amp; load method is pretty awesome. You do have to manually open and rotate the cylinder inside the chamber for the desired bit (way easy). And it pops in and out super easy. I really like it so far. One other thing to note, there is no need to tighten the chuck or any of that, lock, Load &amp; screw&hellip;lol. I dig this little thing!Its the perfect leave in the house got to get it quick tool. The price point is good. Any higher and I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it. To find anything similar is difficult. After some hard use (putting togther Christmas toys!)I will definately update my review to see if it makes the 5 star! Since last year, my DeWalt crushed some delicate stuff, I had to use a manual screwdriver at 1am. Not this year!<strong>UPDATE</strong>I do like the drill and one commenter pointed out correctly that infact the drill bits do auto change: just slide back the slide all the way and it will rotate the cylinder bit to the next one. Yes ok, I missed it. Awesome point out and way awesome feature!!</p>

<h5 id="idea-is-wonderful-manufacturer-credibility-questionable">Idea is wonderful - Manufacturer Credibility Questionable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the WX254L three weeks ago. After the second use - which was just a few turns of screws, the light on the screwdriver that indicates charging stopped coming on. I notified Worx about this - their first response was: The unit has stopped taking a charge due to a defective battery, please return this to the merchant where you purchased it. I explained that I got it from Amazon and not the local hardware store. In the interim, I contacted Amazon, who immediately gave me a call tag for UPS and sent out a new unit instantaneously. I then receive a message from Worx telling me that they would replace the (New) unit, but I would have to pay for shipping back to them. So I have their item for less than thirty days, they admit a defect, but yet I am responsible in laying out more money to return their defect?Amazon Fulfillment - EXCELLENTWorx - The PITS!I&rsquo;ll continue to be part of Prime, but I will no longer purchase any Worx products.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This little power screwdriver is an improvement from manual exertion (the old fashioned way), but I definitely don&rsquo;t think it has enough power or torque to fit the bill for most of my needs. I am trying to do simple &ldquo;diy&rdquo; projects &ndash; so I&rsquo;m not talking about heavy-duty construction or anything like that. Maybe it&rsquo;s my lack of knowledge, but I can&rsquo;t imagine why I can&rsquo;t screw into drywall with it. I know I am avoiding studs since I bought a stud locator from Amazon as well, so to continue hanging a curtain rod means I had to pull out my drill. The nice thing is that it is very simple to use and it comes with a lot of different bits which seem to be pretty hardy!</p>
