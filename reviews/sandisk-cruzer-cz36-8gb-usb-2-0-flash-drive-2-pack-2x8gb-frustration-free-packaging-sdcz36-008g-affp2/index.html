<p>With USB ports popping up everywhere you look, you need a simple and reliable way to store and share your photos, videos and music on the fly. The Cruzer USB Flash Drive is your answer. Because it works with virtually any computer or electronic device with a USB slot, this flash drive lets you leave your laptop at home but still take your vast amounts of content with you to share with family and friends. And to make sure all your important files are protected, SanDisk offers the free SecureAccess software download, which adds a private, password-protected folder to your drive. Whether you need to transport your latest MP3 downloads, vacation videos, or your college thesis, the Cruzer USB Flash Drive offers secure, portable storage that you can trust.</p>

<p>Innovative capless design exposes the USB connector via a convenient slider.</p>

<p>The Cruzer USB Flash Drive is a fast and reliable flash storage device for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10+ and Linux machines.</p>

<p>Convenient Storage and Portability
With USB ports on computers, to new ports popping up on cars, DVD players, TVs, photo frames, and more, the need for a fast and reliable way to share your digital content on a moment&rsquo;s notice is greater than ever.</p>

<p>The Cruzer USB Flash Drive meets that need. This reliable flash drive fits in the palm of your hand and gives you the storage capacity you need to store and transfer up to 8 GB of data.</p>

<p>While the drive is optimized for laptops and devices with USB 2.0 port, it is backwards compatible with older devices that have USB 1.1 ports, so you can be assured of near universal compatibility.</p>

<p>View Videos Without Extra Software or Setup
With the Cruzer USB Flash Drive, you can transfer your favorite video from one device to another easily and conveniently, without any additional software or setup. The drive offers drag-and-drop convenience, which means you can simply drag the files from your device onto your Cruzer Flash drive, or vice versa, without any steps.</p>

<p>Transferring video files from computer to computer, or from your drive to a USB-enabled DVD player, is incredibly simple. Drag your video files from your PC to your USB flash drive and then plug the drive into your DVD player – or even your USB-enabled TV – and sit back to enjoy the show.</p>

<p>Smart, Stylish Design for Ease of Use
With a capless design that exposes the USB connector via a convenient slider, the Cruzer USB Flash Drive looks just as great as it performs.</p>

<p>When you plug the Cruzer USB Flash Drive into your USB-enabled device, a glowing, amber-colored LED alerts you that the drives are ready for reading or writing data. This LED rapidly pulses when data is being transferred, and it slows down when the drives are idle, giving you a clear indication of the disk&rsquo;s activity.</p>

<p>SecureAccess Protects Your Data
Create a private folder or &ldquo;vault&rdquo; on your Cruzer USB Flash Drive with the SecureAccess software, available as a free download on sandisk.com. SecureAccess makes it easy to protect critical files like business presentations or legal documents. Simply drag and drop files into the vault, and they&rsquo;ll be protected by a personal password and automatic 128-bit AES encryption.3 You also get the added protection of secure online backup (up to 2 GB1) offered by SanDisk&rsquo;s online backup partner.4</p>

<p>The Cruzer USB Flash Drive is compatible as a flash storage device with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10+ and Linux machines.</p>

<h5 id="an-okay-flash-drive-for-the-price">An Okay Flash Drive For the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like SanDisk because it&rsquo;s mostly metal on the inside, except for one part that&rsquo;s plastic. That irks me a bit, but I don&rsquo;t expect to use these a great deal as I do my 64 GB flash drive, so the plastic is okay. Because of that and a couple of other things, I didn&rsquo;t give it a 5 star rating. First, what I like: When the flash drive is inserted into the computer, it automatically opens its own window instead of my having to do it and decide which window is the computer&rsquo;s and which is the flash drive&rsquo;s. Okay, that&rsquo;s not SUCH a big deal, but it&rsquo;s nice. I also like that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about lost caps since this obviously slides right back into the case which is covered on both sides. Don&rsquo;t laugh - last year I bough a package of flash drives and when I got them found out they&rsquo;d been downgraded from the prior year&rsquo;s model, and there was NO BACK on the flash drive! At least SanDisk didn&rsquo;t do that. I didn&rsquo;t like that you really have to work at keeping the tongue out when you&rsquo;re putting it into the computer, because it tends to slide right back into the case instead of going directly and easily into the USB port. Also, when taking it out, after you&rsquo;ve gotten the computer to eject the thing, it&rsquo;s hard to pull it out. Now that may be a function of the computer; it&rsquo;s a top grade computer with good tight USB ports that don&rsquo;t wear out like they&rsquo;ve done on some other computers I&rsquo;ve had. So I don&rsquo;t know if this difficulty with getting the flash drive out is because of the flash drive, or the computer. It&rsquo;s an okay flash drive, and I like it fine for carrying my different manuscripts safely, but if I had to use it every day, I&rsquo;d be frustrated with its problems putting it in, and getting it out. I don&rsquo;t have that problem with any of my other flash drives, so I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s the flash drive. My advice is that if you&rsquo;re not going to use this constantly, it&rsquo;s fine. But&hellip;if you&rsquo;re going to be using it frequently, spend a little more money and get a better flash drive, maybe one with more memory. I like it, but it&rsquo;s no great shakes.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-8-gigger">A great 8 gigger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the cheapest 8GB sticks around, but they sure are good ones. I&rsquo;d say, premium quality. They are highly accurate, fast for being 2.0, and my favorite feature is the glowing glider. The red area glows as the stick is being accessed. You can tell when it is busy, and when it is just snoozing (it does a cool sort of fade in and fade out as though it&rsquo;s softly breathing when it&rsquo;s inactive). The sticks have a solid feel, retract nicely when not in use, and I use them confidently to store important data.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wasn-t-sure-at-first">Wasn&rsquo;t Sure At First&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally use USB drives as I have a in home network that I move most of my files around on. (Otherwise, I download them from the net.) But I found that I needed a make a installation media for Win 10 and wanted to get in some experience booting from a USB drive so I got these. The drives themselves seem to work OK, but one thing to note, as with HD, the 8 gigs is TOTAL SPACE WITH NOTHING ON THE DRIVE! What this means is when you format it you won&rsquo;t have 8 gigs, but something like 7.9 or less. Why? Space is used to save media information and if NTFS other items. It would be nice if they listed the formatted size but they don&rsquo;t&hellip;.or if they did I missed it. Anyway, these come in two small plastic storage bags which comes in a large stiff paper envelope instead of a normal sealed retail style package. After opening the package and breaking out the drives, I saw that instead of a cover over the plug, the plug re-tracks into the body of the drive. Not a bad idea from my point of view. Next I plugged the drive into one of my front USB ports and it was &ldquo;seen&rdquo; by the Win 10 system I&rsquo;m running without a problem. I did a couple of writes to in and reads from it with no problems encountered. I did note one thing that sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I know it&rsquo;s common now a days to place &ldquo;extras&rdquo; under you nose which might encourage you to buy something else, but I really don&rsquo;t like this kind of thing when I but something. I didn&rsquo;t notice anywhere that it said anything about software on the new drive, but that&rsquo;s what I found on it. Now if you were going to use these drives for storing sensitive data then this would be OK, but to act as if you wanted it WITH the drive is a bit much to me. My first action was to move the software off the drive so I had the use of as much space as I could. I used one of the drives to create an installation disk for Win 10 Pro as a back up. It works great with not problems. When the drive is plugged in a light on the switch you use to extend the plug pulses to let you know the drive is plugged in. So far I&rsquo;ve had not problem with either of these drives and it&rsquo;s capacity is just about what I need now. Not a bad little drive.</p>

<h5 id="incompatible-with-chromebooks-chromeos-for-use-as-a-restore-drive">INCOMPATIBLE WITH CHROMEBOOKS (ChromeOS) FOR USE AS A RESTORE DRIVE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE! THIS MODEL DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK TO MAKE A BACKUP/RESTORE IMAGE ON CHROMEBOOKS! I purchased this with the intent of using it to create a &ldquo;backup image&rdquo; of my Chromebook. While the drive works fine in Windows and for USB storage on ChromeOS (Any Chromebook), it couldn&rsquo;t be used to create a restore drive for my Chromebook. I tried from both the Chromebook itself AND a Windows 8.1 PC.I contacted Google support and they actually told me that several other people have had problems with the SanDisk Cruzer C736. This is a ChromeOS compatibility issue. Apparently ChromeOS has a lot of trouble with ANY SanDisk USB drive. If you are buying this for the purpose of making a OS backup of your Chromebook look elswhere like Patriot. If you are buying this for your Chromebook just to put documents and other files on it like normal it will be fine.</p>
