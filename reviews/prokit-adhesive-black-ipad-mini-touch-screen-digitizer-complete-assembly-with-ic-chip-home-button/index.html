<h5 id="worked-great">Worked great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 5 year old dropped her ipad mini, and unfortunately the screen was badly cracked. We went ahead and bought a new one, but I figured why not try to replace the screen. It was already broke so there was really no risk if it didn&rsquo;t go well. Anyway, after watching a ton of Youtube videos I felt at least somewhat confident that I could handle the repair. I highly suggest you watch repair videos several times until you have a good grasp of how to do it. This kit arrive in perfect condition and with pretty much all the required tools to complete the job, and no soldering required. The hardest part is getting the old screen off, but it still went better than I imagined. This probably would have been easier with a heat gun, but I used a hair dryer and it still came off mostly in one piece. The entire replacement from start to finish took around an hour and a half, including vacuuming up all the broken glass. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a try, and the ipad looks and works as good as new. I would highly recommend this replacement set.</p>

<h5 id="worked-less-than-one-day">Worked less than one day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This replacement went well and worked perfectly. I did not even give it back to my nephew and the screen cracked. No pressure applied, wasn&rsquo;t even being used. I set it down on the table, came back to get it a few hours later and the top of the screen was cracked across the top from the middle to the side. No one else in the house, only used long enough to check touch response and the home button.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lack-of-instructions-made-it-hard-to-install-this-screen">Lack of instructions made it hard to install this screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was shipped fast and packed well. The tools included were useful. At the end after I replaced LCD and screen on my iPad Mini everything works, so mission accomplished. However I took away two stars because the installation was not easy due to complete lack of instructions or descriptions. They said see youtube video, however no link was provided and i wasn&rsquo;t able to find a video for this specific screen. They put a big sticker with warning info on screen&rsquo;s inside and it was a hassle to remove it. There were some blue tapes on inside of screen and wasn&rsquo;t sure if i have to remove it or not. After putting everything back together and using heat gun to activate the adhesives, the screen still pops up a bit. So I need to use heavy case to not to expose the screen edges. At the end it works and it was cheap but could avoid some guessing and frustration if better instruction would be given.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-a-great-set-for-a-decent-price">This was a great set for a decent price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a great set for a decent price. I pay a neighborhood guy to fix my 9 year old&rsquo;s iPad every time he breaks the screen. That&rsquo;s about 4 times now. Don&rsquo;t worry, my kid pays for the parts and the labor! It was installed quickly and worked like new.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-worked-perfectly-but-it-takes-patience">Product worked perfectly but it takes patience!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After watching a couple YouTube videos, my husband and I decided to replace the shattered mini iPad screen. It was a tedious process but we did get it done! At first, we thought we made a mistake because we weren&rsquo;t able to see anything on the screen after completing the replacement process. Then we read online that you might have to do a hard reset (pressing home and wake/sleep button simultaneously for around 10-15 seconds). This did the trick and it has been working perfectly. Plus it was some great team building/quality time for us :)</p>

<h5 id="perfect-replacement-relatively-easy-repair-as-long-as-you-re-patient">Perfect replacement, relatively easy repair as long as you&rsquo;re patient.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too many times products like this get a bad review because of the customer&rsquo;s error. This works perfectly for my iPad mini touch retina (1st retina). I set the iPad on a window ledge like a dumb donkey and it slide off and landed on it&rsquo;s side on the tile floor. It bent the case and cracked the touch screen.I bought this kit and was able to fix it in a few hours.#1 Go slow and be patient&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t force anything, if it doesn&rsquo;t move don&rsquo;t force it. You should never force anything with very much pressure and you will be fine.Be care full when removing the broken digitizer or you may break your LCD too.Make sure to get as much of the sticky stuff off as you can before replacing it with the new digitizer.that aside&hellip;The adhesive on this one is cut to perfection, it wraps around every little opening and curve on the frame.Since my frame was bent a little I had to bend it back a bit and I had some struggle getting the display to sit perfectly (but do not force it or try to snap it into the frame). I had another one break trying to press it into the frame ( lesson learned ).The tools are useful that come with it and I even saved them for future repairs.The display looks great through the digitizer and everything works as expected. I can definitely recommend this as a replacement and would buy it again if needed.Don&rsquo;t force it! (broken record I know).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me say,First time trying to replace a screen on anything so I have nothing to compare but was fairly easy.Does not come with instructions,watched you tube video was straight forward. Like previous reviews screws are &ldquo;tiny&rdquo;. Used a heat gun not a hair dryer to remove the screen. Start to finish about an hour. Working well. Next time I drop my mini will purchase again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered to replace my daughters busted iPad mini 2 screen. Arrived on time and was packaged pretty good. Took me about 45 minutes to replace screen. New screen works perfectly and looks great. Will definitely order another screen from here if she breaks this one.&mdash;EDIT!&mdash;After about 2-3 weeks after replacing my daughters ipad screen the left side of the screen does NOT work anymore. Gonna try a different brand next time.</p>

<p>it doesn&rsquo;t come with the screen adhesive</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-adhesive-backing">Poor adhesive backing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Adhesive is not very good on the back of the screen. Could not get adhesive to adhear correctly. When I slightly pressed on the top right hand corner the screen cracked.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adhesive-instructions-where">Adhesive? Instructions where?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Adhesive? what adhesive, is there suppose to be some sort of protective thing you peel off to reveal it? well who knows since there is no instructions or link to any included.</p>
