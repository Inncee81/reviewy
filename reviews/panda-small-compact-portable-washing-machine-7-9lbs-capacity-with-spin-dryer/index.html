<h5 id="panda-does-it-again-even-better-than-my-first-love-the-panda-mini-edited-to-add-rinse-tip">Panda does it again! Even better than my first love, the Panda mini&hellip;.edited to add RINSE TIP!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although my old mini Panda (blue machine) is still going strong, my niece just had a baby this past year and I am sending the Panda mini off to her to help make surviving toddlerhood a little easier for her and her little man. I have upgraded to this new Panda small compact portable washing machine that includes the spin dryer too - all in one small unit! Since I am still living in an apartment with no washer and dryer or hook ups, this machine is even easier and better than the Panda mini/blue washer in every way for my laundry needs. With a stated 6-7 pound capacity, it has the ability to do larger loads, and with the electrically assisted pump I find that rinsing and draining are much easier! What more could I have wanted but an attached spin dryer which is now on board too; it does a fantastic job of wringing the clothes almost bone dry. Having loved the Panda mini washer for nearly two years, I am even more impressed and happy with my new Panda Small Compact Portable washing machine! Here are a few more notes and hints I have come up with for getting the best results with the Panda small compact washer:Use a mesh bag with any articles of clothing that have long sleeves, or long legs, especially items that get very heavy when wet like jeans or sweaters. The agitator in the washer side is very powerful and therefore free floating long articles of clothing can get tangled or twisted together during the wash cycle. I have found that the clothing still gets perfectly clean when mesh bags are used, but with no tangling or damage to the fabrics.When using the washer for the first time try adding the load of laundry with NO SOAP, just water and set the timer for 3-5 minutes. Frequently there is a great amount of soap residue and buildup trapped in the clothing fibers and you will see this as foam or even suds appearing when the clothing is just agitated with clean water. As you wash those same clothes in the Panda a second or third time you will need anywhere from teaspoon to about a tablespoon of high efficiency liquid soap per load depending on the type of fabric, type of detergent, size of load, and how soiled it is.When not in use, leave both doors to the washer and spin dryer open. This will help any water droplets left behind to evaporate, avoiding any issues with moisture, mold or mildew.I am attaching a detailed video comparing the two machines so if it has not appeared yet, please check back in a day or two. If you have a question that has not been covered here please use the comments section to ask; I will do my best to answer.06/27/13 Edited to add: Regarding rinsing: The instructions do NOT state the following tip, but after using the machine for over two months I have tried this rinsing trick with great success. Because my method is NOT part of the original use instructions, I can only recommend you try this next tip &ldquo;at your own risk&rdquo;. By following these steps, you can quickly and efficiently rinse the just cleaned load to be completely soap free AND you can save the soapy water for re-use with next load (assuming the water is not extremely dirty from the previous load).Step 1: do NOT drain soapy side. Just transfer the wet soapy clothes to the spinner basket.Step 2: with <em>both</em> spinner doors OPEN, add 5 minutes time on the spin timer. This will cause the spin side to continuously drain any water you will be adding while you rinse. For this step, to add water you can use a diverter/sprayer, the original hose, or small bucket with a pouring spout.Step 3: When feel you have finished adding enough water to rinse the clothes, use the plastic screen gadget that is included with the spinner to press the clothes down, compacting as them as firmly as possible.Step 4: Close the lid and allow the machine to spin the clothes as dry as possible.Compacting the clothes shortens the spin time by effectively wringing at least part of the excess water out and also prevents a waterlogged, unbalanced load from making the whole machine &ldquo;shimmy&rdquo;. This is also why it is a GOOD thing that the spin side is SO small - for optimal performance in spinning the clothes.Step 5: If you still see any soap residue in the water being drained, re-set the timer for another 2-3 minutes and use either the hose provided or even a small measuring cup to slowly pour a small amount of additional water into the spin side inlet hole; the added water will be very rapidly dispersed into the garments and provide an even cleaner rinse. Repeat any of the steps as necessary but just make sure there is at least 1-2 full minutes of uninterrupted spin time left where no additional water is added in order to have the most water wrung from the clothes and have the shortest possible drying time. Good luck! - DG08/18/13 Edited to add - Immediately after posting the original review I had submitted a revision with a disclaimer stating the source of the item(s) under review. I was not aware until today that the revision was not accepted or posted by Amazon, possibly due to the fact that the video portion of the review depicts TWO products with two different sources. To be 100% clear and transparent, I have created and posted over 800 reviews, and as of this edit, all except three items were purchased by me with my own funds; the reviews are either marked by Amazon as such, with a badge stating &ldquo;Amazon Verified Purchase&rdquo; or I often state where I purchased the item in the written review, ex. big box store, Walmart, etc. Since I am entirely new to having a product submitted to me for review, this video is unique as it features a product of both circumstances. The video demonstrates my experience two units; the one referred to as the &ldquo;blue machine&rdquo; I paid for with my own funds through Amazon.com in Nov. 2011. I received the &ldquo;white machine&rdquo; (the greater subject of this review) directly from Sepgo, Inc. at no cost to me for the purpose of testing and review in May 2013. Regardless of source , the opinions expressed are 100% my own with NO influence from any other person or company. Thank you to a youtube user whose question alerted me to the fact that my disclaimer stating such had not been added as requested; my integrity as a reviewer is very important to me and I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify the matter. Sincerely, -DGREAD MORE</p>

<p>I purchased this to avoid having to go the laundromat and have been very pleased.Good Things-It&rsquo;s small and convenient-It&rsquo;s light enough to move alone when empty-It&rsquo;s surprisingly effectiveBad Things-The &ldquo;Lint Trap&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t great. If you want to launder an item that has a large amount of lint and don&rsquo;t intend to run it through a dryer with a good lint filter then you should prepare to find another way to remove lint.Other things-A buzzer would be a nice addition to this unit.Tips-Find out how long it takes to fill your device with hot cold and warm water (yes, test each one individually. Odds are your flow rate is dependent on temperature of water). Use those times as a guidline for filling times so you do not have to watch it patiently.-Weight matters more than size. Heavy items can weigh the agitator at the bottom down and if the clothes aren&rsquo;t spinning somewhat aggressively they wont get clean. If you are unsure of how much to load, fill the tub and add your soap and start the wash cycle. Keeping the lid open begin slowly feeding in clothing items one at a time allowing for the agitator to reverse directions and assuring that the clothes are still moving aggressively before each new addition. If the movement slows and doesn&rsquo;t return after 2 or 3 agitator reversals then you have put in too much and should take something out (you can pop it into the spin dryer tub while it waits)-When the spin dryer is on the unit wobble a bit and can be noisy depending on the surface the unit is on. I have this unit on a metal shelf and have taken to keeping a folded towel underneath it to lessen noise and help prevent the unit from wandering when it wobbles.-For people concerned about the size of the unit, some loads I wash often look like: My sheets (both fitted and flat) and pillowcases in one load; 3-4 pairs of khakis at once; 1-2 pairs of jeans at once ; 4-6 button down shirts at a time; 2-4 polos at once(weight dependent); 1-2 bath towels at once (if washing a bath sheet it can only handle one)READ MORE</p>
