<h5 id="and-the-separate-compartments-are-great-in-case-of-rain-so-he-does-not-have">and the separate compartments are great in case of rain so he does not have &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After spending 3.5 years working overseas in Afghanistan, my son loves all things military. As the new school year approached, he wanted a backpack line nothing any of the other kids would have, and of course he loves camouflage. After much searching, he decided on this backpack for his school bag, and with a week of school behind us he loves it. He is able to fit all his things in there, it secures well over him, especially when riding a bike, and the separate compartments are great in case of rain so he does not have to open the whole bag just to get a rain coat out.The bag seems well built, and a bit heavier than I would have expected. The only negative I can say about it is at the top center of the back there is a row of Velcro with elastic loops sewn over most of it. It would have been nice to have a little more exposed Velcro to allow for a traditional name plate, but this is by no means insurmountable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-and-affordable">Sturdy and affordable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will start my saying that I purchased this backpack on my own for work and did not receive any benefits for this review. Just trying to help others who have questions regarding this product.Size: This back pack is the perfect size for a 48-72 hour pack. I am a Paramedic who works 24 hour shifts and I am able to pack workout clothes (basketball shorts and a t-shirt), a spare uniform (polo, EMS duty pants, t-shirt, extra socks, and boxers), my eye glasses case, a beanie, a winter hood, and winter gloves in the main compartment (the one closest to your back). In the large middle compartment I carry magazines and a 24 oz coffee mug. In the front compartments I carry an extra pair of sunglasses, toiletries, and other assorted items. All of this is packed with room for another set of clothes.Quality: Even though I have only had this pack for a month the stitching appears to be very sturdy. Straps are thick and most of the, with the exception of the upper part of the shoulder strap, are doubled over at the ends and stitched so they don&rsquo;t come through the tightener. The shoulder straps that are not doubled over are tight enough in the tightener that they have not came loose in the least. The shoulder straps are padded and the padding was stiff for the first few weeks so it seems to be good for the long term. They have black D rings on the straps that are fairly thin but are perfect for hanging glasses cases, flashlights, keys, or any other items. The zippers are also sturdy metal and the zippers themselves are smooth on opening. As others have mentioned, the paracord around the zippers needs re-tied in a better knot but otherwise it&rsquo;s just find out of the box. The only main downside is that the inside liner seems to be slightly loose and appears that it could rip out or tear easier than the rest of the pack but it appears to be stitched separately so if it does happen it will not hurt the integrity of he bag itself.Overall I would suggest this pack to anyone who is looking for an affordable 48-72 hour hiking, camping, work, or utility backpack. It is well worth the extra few dollars than paying for a cheaper, less sturdy backpack and more cost efficient than the 5.11 or other brand name ruck or duty blocks.</p>

<h5 id="not-a-buy-it-for-life-item-does-exactly-what-i-need-it-to-do">Not a &ldquo;buy it for life&rdquo; item, does exactly what I need it to do.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pack is exactly what I was looking for as a &ldquo;get home&rdquo; bag to keep in my car at all times. It&rsquo;s designed like a military pack, so it has tons of compartments and pockets for organization freaks like me.It&rsquo;s not made of canvas, it&rsquo;s a regular nylon weave, and the zippers are not super rugged. I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this as some kind of regular use pack, I just needed to keep all my emergency car stuff in one place in case I have to hoof it back home once, this will do.If you need something to take camping on the regular, or even a book-bag for school on a daily basis, I do not believe this is the bag for you.</p>

Trust me I read every review and looked for a solid week before this purchase ..Iam so happy I made this choice plus it&rsquo;s got a pouch for a water bladder</p>

<h5 id="bigger-than-you-think-5-for-what-i-use-maybe-not-for-everyone">bigger than you think! 5 for what I use&hellip; maybe not for everyone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This backpack is pretty cool. I bought it as a school / common items bag so because I live in two houses and need a good bag to carry my essentials. The biggest pocket is much bigger than i expected, (tall wise) and can fit notebooks with about 6 inches more to spare. as for the width, there is plenty of space for slightly wider books or binders. It&rsquo;s not crazy big though so don&rsquo;t be expecting to put 4 text books in it. There is NO water bottle pocket which kind of turned me off for a minute but after I filled it with all of my things, there was still plenty of space for a water bottle inside. So that&rsquo;s something to keep in mind. Also the waist strap broke its plastic hing when i was trying to adjust it, which isn&rsquo;t a problem for me because I don&rsquo;t use those, and ended up taking it off anyway. Besides those few issues, I love it, and its perfect for what I need so i give it a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. I got the tan version because I love pins and charms etc, and they show up well on it- why that would be useful to other people i don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m also very glad to see a large amount of unspecified straps on the outside (which is good) for you too add your own necessities clipped to it. Great for the price!!!</p>

<h5 id="great-bag">Great bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> This backpack is STILL going strong, and I did, indeed, purchase a second one for my son for school. He attends a school where they use a program called AVID. Great program, but it requires them to carry a RIDICULOUS 4&rdquo; binder around, along with half the inventory of your average office supply store. This backpack has been WONDERFUL for him - all the little pockets and compartments have helped him to organize further.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this bag. It&rsquo;s HUGE inside without being ridiculous outside. Everything feels sturdy, and there are PLENTY of compartments inside to organize things without having to resort to tossing everything into a single pouch (I hate that). This was a great purchase, and I will likely purchase another for my son at back to school time!</p>
