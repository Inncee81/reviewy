<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-screen">Good Screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>nice screen! 120&rdquo; is pretty big.I put mine on the ceiling cuz my TV is on the wall, so when the screen is down the TV sits behind the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-need-better-packaging">Good product, need better packaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THE GOOD:- This is a slightly higher quality screen than some others so it makes less bright projectors really shine nicely. the surface is even and sturdy and lived up to the abuse of a college common room.- It has good mounting options and secured easily.- The retraction method is easy and sturdy.THE BAD:- Bent on arrival. This thing shows up in a package that is hilariously long and thin and as you can imagine it got pretty banged up in transit. I probably should have sent it back, but we really wanted to get it all set up and the dent wasn&rsquo;t that huge so we just went with it. I knock off only one star because I know most of the blame should go to the shipping company, but slightly better packaging would have avoided this, it was basically just thrown in a flimsy box without packing material.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-and-excellent-customer-service">Good value and excellent customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This arrived on time via carrier and appeared to be in good condition. When I unpacked it to install it, I discovered that the left endcap was cracked. This was rather disappointing, as I didn&rsquo;t feel I could install it in that condition. I sent an message to the manufacturer on their website regarding it at around 8pm in the evening (CT) and received a call from someone within ten minutes! - which really surprised and pleased me. He said he&rsquo;d get me a replacement endcap and ended up sending it 2-Day, so I&rsquo;d get it in time for Thanksgiving Day football. He also emailed me instructions on how to replace the endcap (which required some finesse, as removal of the endcap uncoils the spring). I feel that when shipping something like this, there are going to be a percentage with some damage, and I was quite pleased with the prompt and helpful service in resolving the issue.I have used this screen at least a dozen times now, and it extends and retracts as it should. I initially was expecting it to self-extract after pulling down sharply, but you do have to guide it back up, which is fine. I was easily able to adjust my projector to fill up all the white area of the screen, and the black masking border hides any projection overlap, which creates a very nice appearance. I would definitely buy this again.My only complaint (for which I docked it one star) is that it doesn&rsquo;t sit quite straight when extended - the sides seem to be slightly further from the projector than the middle and sometimes a slight wrinkle is visible in certain lights. When watching football with a score bar at the bottom of the screen, the bar isn&rsquo;t quite straight - it curves down slightly at both ends. This is just enough to annoy my perfectionist brain but not enough to make me unhappy with the screen. The issue may be that I have it extending down in front of windows; so there isn&rsquo;t a solid wall behind it, as there probably are in most applications; perhaps a solid wall behind would help it to sit flatter and straighter.</p>

<h5 id="poorly-built-lots-of-ripples-waviness-not-worth-it">Poorly built, LOTS of ripples/waviness, not worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>edit 2: Elite sent a 2nd replacement screen, it is in MUCH better shape. Again, no non-tensioned screen will be completely flat, so I wasn&rsquo;t expecting perfection, this replacement Elite sent me directly is about as good as this kind of screen can be. I&rsquo;ve updated to 4 stars, now that I&rsquo;ve received a screen that was in good shape I&rsquo;m very impressed with how it looks.edit: To their credit, Elite Screens has contacted me asking to see if they can make this right. I will update this review with the final outcome and change the rating if warranted.I am really not impressed with this screen. It arrived damaged the first time, so I had to go through a return process. The roller casing had a dent in it, and the screen was COVERED in wrinkles and waviness. I figured the dented casing had bent something internally and that was twisting the screen, but no such luck, the replacement had the same issue.All pull down screens that aren&rsquo;t tab-tensioned will have rippling to some extent, but a well-made pull down screen will look MUCH better than this one. There are three enormous v-shaped ripples that start near the bottom center of the screen, that&rsquo;s where the pulldown handle is located. The bottom bar is so cheaply made that it flexes when you pull the screen down, which over time causes the wrinkles to look worse and worse.There is also SERIOUS curling on the right and left edge of the screen, it&rsquo;s extremely noticeable when there is any motion around either edge of the picture. The v-shaped wrinkles present themselves more by making the image look like it&rsquo;s &ldquo;breathing&rdquo; subtly in and out, especially when the camera pans from side to side.All of this leads to movies looking nowhere near as good as they could. The screen material is plenty bright, the viewing angles are good, and the casing looks great, the wrinkles and waviness just ruin it. Since I&rsquo;ve gotten two screens with the same issue, and see plenty of other reviews here where people indicate the same problem, I haven&rsquo;t bothered with a warranty exchange because I&rsquo;m sure I&rdquo;ll just end up with the same issues on a 3rd screen, with the added bonus of getting to painstakingly hang and level it a third time as well, no thanks.I&rsquo;ll go with a tab-tensioned screen next time, I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m going to go with Elite again however.</p>
