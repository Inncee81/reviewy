<blockquote>
<p>I just got the adapter&hellip;and overall aesthetically its what I was expecting from the pictures others hath posted. No surprises. The real test to me was&hellip;.if it would blend :-)Just kidding. THE SPEED TEST. That&rsquo;s what I was concerned about as someone else pointed this does not support the higher UHS-I and UHS-II speeds. So I tested the stock PNY adapter (P-SDU128U185EL-GE) which had UHS-I vs. the BaseQi Adapter in Crystal Disk Mark. SURPRISINGLY, though the PNY adapter was ever so slightly faster, the BaseQi adapter lost very little performance and was actually faster in ONE . I&rsquo;ve added images of the test (the one that has 64.06 is the BaseQi adapter)One other tip that might be useful for my fellow surfacebook bretheren (and sisteren), if you want windows to recognize this is a full blown drive instead of removable media (which is helpful for example if you are using this as your major dropbox drive which doesn&rsquo;t allow your dropbox folder to be stored on a &lsquo;removable media&rsquo; drive) follow these steps I found online. [&hellip;]It&rsquo;s only been day one, but I will update with my long term use. Vote up if you found the speed test comparison helpful!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Update May 25th, 2017:I interacted with the company support via email when my adapter would not read my brand new Samsung 128 gig card. I could put the card in the shipped SD adapter and my SurfaceBook would read it just fine. They agreed it sounded defective and sent me a replacement, and asked me to send mine back so they could run tests on it. I appreciated that (as I am a professional in the technical field), so I did.The replacement adapter came in what is the inner packaging for the card. Obviously opened. I looked carefully at the outside gold contacts on the adapter and there was a slight blemish you would expect if you plugged it into a card slot. This is what I had hoped would happen. They tested it would work before they sent it to me.So it works. My file copies onto the card are very fast, in the range of about 70 megabytes a second. So the adapter isn&rsquo;t inducing any problems with this card. At this point I am happy with the adapter and will be leaving it in place. I&rsquo;ll be using the space as a backup location for my files / code / documents. A SurfaceBook can die at any time. If you don&rsquo;t have a backup of your data that you can have outside of it, then you just lost the game. Using this with a big enough card as your removable backup will safety net for when that happens.I would not suggest you keep pulling this thing out and swapping cards in it. This was built to be flush to the surface of the SurfaceBook. It is possible to extract the adapter with your finger nail. But each time you do, you add a little more wear and tear on it. So keep that kind of swapping to a minimum if possible and it will last a whole lot longer.Why four stars? The only thing I could ding them on is quality control. One person gets a bad one, you say &ldquo;well, that was unexpected&rdquo;. But when more start popping up, then you know you have a problem somewhere. With an adapter this simple, that should be so unlikely to happen that when it does, it should also be: &ldquo;well, that was unexpected&rdquo;.Note that there are absolutely no quality control concerns with the physical device itself. It is well made in that aspect.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t normally write reviews this quick, but when it doesn&rsquo;t work - may as well. I have had it in hand for 4 hours now.I bought mine and a new Samsung 128 gig micro SD card for it. Put them together, put it in my Surface Book, and nothing shows up. Which isn&rsquo;t quite true. In Windows 10 device manager, it shows an SD card device connected, but as if there was no &lsquo;drive&rsquo; in it.Take it all out, place the card into the Samsung supplied SD card adapter and into the Surface Book, and it works just fine.Take out another 128gb MicroSD card I have in a Surface Pro, and have been using for months. Nothing. Use a 64gb card I have laying around. Nothing. Put them all in the Samsung adapter - they all work just fine. (all my other cards are SanDisk)So you would think &lsquo;well, its dead then&rsquo;. And here is where it gets weird. If I put a 128 MEGAbyte card in it, then that pops up just fine.So something is going wrong. I&rsquo;ll try and see if the manufacturer will directly interact with me to resolve. Otherwise it is a risky purchase I don&rsquo;t advise yet.If you are looking for an aluminum hole filler to plug that gap, well, then this $25.00 gap filler fits right in and flush too. A bit much for that task though.</p>

<h5 id="fits-the-surface-book-well-but-expensive">Fits the Surface Book well, but expensive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>USE CASEI bought this for my Surface Book i5/256/dGPU. The SB has a slot to accept full size SD cards, but about half the card sticks out, like on a Macbook. Thus, you can&rsquo;t really use a full size SD card for storage expansion. So, you need to buy one of these adapters and a microSD card (I bought a Samsung 128GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC Card with Adapter up to 48MB/s (MB-MP128DA/AM) card for $50). I wanted to put a bunch of music and movies on it, since the SB is a pretty good media device.INITIAL IMPRESSIONSThe adapter is pretty well made, and the color is close enough to the SB&rsquo;s color. Everything fits perfectly, if you run a finger along the side of the SB when this is plugged in, you can barely tell it&rsquo;s there. Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t have any boot issues with my microSD card + adapter combination - my bootup time seems to be the same regardless of using the adapter.2 WEEK REVIEWAfter about 2 weeks, the adapter + SD card still seems to be performing well. I have had no issues with booting up. With the SB though, you do have to keep in mind you shouldn&rsquo;t detach the screen when you&rsquo;re using the SD card. The SB does let you do it, and it will be like unplugging a USB drive when you&rsquo;re doing something with it. So that&rsquo;s something I have to keep in mind when watching a movie or something (pause it, remember the time I was at, close the program, detach it, flip the screen around, open the program, etc). It would be nice if the Surface DTX tray icon realizes when the SD card/USB drives are in use and stop you from detaching the screen.FINAL NOTEI only give this thing 4 stars because it was $25 when I bought it. That&rsquo;s a heck of a lot for what is pretty much the same adapter you get for free when you buy a microSD card, just in a different size. Obviously if you can afford a Surface Book or a Macbook then BaseQi probably thinks you can splurge on this adapter, but it would be nicer at a $10 price point. Unfortunately the only alternative at this point is to buy one of the many Macbook adapters out there, but none of them fit as perfectly as this one.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-fit">Perfect fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Appears to be well made, perfect flush fit for the Surface Book and a close color match. The flush fit means it isn&rsquo;t as easy to remove as an SD card would be but if you want to use it as a second drive that&rsquo;s not an issue. I paired it with a 200GB MicroSD and use it for File History.</p>
