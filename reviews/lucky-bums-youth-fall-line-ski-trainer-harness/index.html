<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly Recommend!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little harness system worked perfect!! It&rsquo;s a small pack with 2 zipper compartments, so can store leash handles when not in use, and really still had enough room for gloves and snack too!. The harness buckles are great, clasp on the front chest is secure. ski leashes clip in to little rings on the front side of the straps (gray straps are worn in front). Theres an additional top hand that is right above the pink back pack so easy to grab quickly/securely and control-recover from fall, and also less likely to injure the child compared to if you were to try to grab by their arm or coat. Product seems well made. We used it with two year old, but feel that I could have also used with my six year old and still maintained good control. Highly recommend!!!!</p>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny-i-highly-recommend-it">Worth Every Penny&hellip;I highly recommend it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> year old did fantastic with this system. I was nervous at first since, I read a review about another brand that attaches on the ski boot. The other brand claims that lucky bums promote leaning back when you pull back on your child&rdquo;s chest straps but, this was not an issue at all. My son just naturally leaned forward as we gained momentum down the hill. I also felt a sense of security of avoiding my son from face planting with the chest straps. My son never came close to falling he just had a great time going down hill. At this age, I believe kids have the natural sense of proper form based on instincts. I actually ran into a woman at the airport at the end of our trip with a 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> year old daughter who had the boot strap system didn&rsquo;t do well and, had to resort to straddling her daughter between her skiis. Any skier knows straddling a kid between skiis can be exhausting and painful on the parent&rsquo;s lower back, not to mention promote more dependence and poor mechanics for the child.</p>

<h5 id="this-item-was-very-easy-to-put-on-the-kids-and-get-it-set">This item was very easy to put on the kids and get it set &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this item for two kids under age 6, second time on the slopes for both. This item was very easy to put on the kids and get it set up. The two cords that act as reigns/leashes are long enough to give the child plenty of freedom to cruise around. I could keep my distance (8-10 feet, I think) without worrying about running them over if they fell down. In one instance, the little skier was headed straight toward a lift pole, but I steered him away with little pulling on one cord. All in all, exactly what I needed.</p>

<h5 id="safe-easy-to-use-and-compact">Safe, easy to use, and compact</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what we needed for our new 3 year old skier for a novice parent-ski instructor who doesn&rsquo;t like to ski backwards (after toddler got the first 2 lessons from a real ski instructor). As previously reported by other reviewers (for this and another version that has a black pouch with red straps, and other reviews elsewhere on the web), the best features are the handle to lift the toddler onto the lift, and the long straps for pure safety reasons and to help steer just a very little bit. Keep the straps super slack (to let child ski), and let go if child falls (so kid doesn&rsquo;t get dragged if you are still moving). Backpack is cute (good for extra underwear and snacks), and our boy loved wearing it, before and while he was skiing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loved-this">Loved this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect to assist our five year old in getting down the slopes safely. We especially love the handle on the backpack to get her on and off the lifts. We also used one without a backpack and had no where to store the straps when we were on the easier slopes and didn&rsquo;t need to use them.</p>
