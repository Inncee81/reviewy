<h5 id="great-cables-and-i-ve-literally-seen-most">Great Cables, and I&rsquo;ve literally seen most</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So to begin, I&rsquo;m a Home Theater Installer. I spent five years with Best Buy both selling and installing TVs. I never got too much into the Monster Cable stuff, as at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s copper wire with covering; I used to sell people the less expensive cables, citing this as the reason. That said, you can judge an HDMI Cable on two (2) things: Pictures Quality, which, for the vast majority, will be absolutely the same, whether the cable costs you $1 or $1,000. This is why people say don&rsquo;t spend more money, and they&rsquo;d be mostly right. However, the 2nd category that&rsquo;s used to judge HDMI Cables is build quality, and THAT can be a big difference. All build quality really refers to is the head (The gold part you plug into the devices you have), and how it will do considering the rest of the cable is hanging off of it, thus potentially causing it to bend and snap. THIS is why some cables are worth spending more money on. I mean if you don&rsquo;t put it on the wall and hide the wires, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter, as you have easy access. But this is the reason I&rsquo;ve stuck with Bluerigger. In my mind, despite the fact that I don&rsquo;t buy Monster, they are the Smart Shoppers Monster Equivalent. I would use them in my own system, and I use them with all of my customers. They make a good product, and they offer it at an amazing price. Buy this cable. The only reason cables cost more at big box stores, for those of you unfamiliar with retail, is that is where they make up the money they lose when they sell you a TV. That&rsquo;s right folks, a $1,000 TV costs the store/company about $850 to $900 to buy, maybe a little less. They make their money on cables and other accessories.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-chord-no-issues">Excellent chord.. No issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any complaints with this product. I bought it at a pretty decent price and the quality of the product is great! I bought this two years ago and am still using it without any problems. And that&rsquo;s after avid use with a tv. We&rsquo;ve moves with chord and its setup around multiple times and it hasn&rsquo;t sustained so much as a scratch on it. There&rsquo;s not problem with the picture it projects either. So, for the price of this cable vs the price of a cable in maybe a Wal-Mart, this is definitely the better pick, if you don&rsquo;t mind waiting for a little bit for it to be delivered. I definitely recommend this to anyone needing an HDMI chord.. And that means anyone, whether it be a tech guy in a large business needing high quality chords, or just a simple peasant at home needing to hook their dvd player up to the tv. <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></p>

<h5 id="surprising-quality-great-price">Surprising quality, great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made, works perfectly, fits snug and stays in place. Highly recommended. I have read many different articles on the quality of HDMI cable brands. Some manufactures try to impress you that you must use this kind or that kind for different resolution visual quality. Some science magazines and Internet articles say basically this type of marketing is a lot of hype just to grab your cash at lightning speed. Bottom line, digital signal is a digital signal. Like over-the-air HD TV signals, you either have a great picture or none at all. In other words, to the human eye and ear, you really can&rsquo;t tell the difference when the digital signal is properly received then transferred to your TV. However, there are different quality materials that will make your HDMI cable more usable, more likely it will last longer, and you must order the right cable length &ndash; meaning no more than you have to. Do remember the signal does start disintegrating with useless extra cable length curled up behind your entertainment center. How much will it lower picture/sound quality over a certain length? From my research, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference again if you use a 6&rsquo; cable vs a 12&rsquo; cable, but you may if you stretch the HDMI signal 50&rsquo; across your attic and down into another part of your house. In that case, it&rsquo;s time to call the cable guy. Back to the quality of BlueRigger High Speed HDMI &ndash; I purchased the 2m (6.6&rsquo;) cable which was all I needed and it left a little slack for easy installing. The cable is thick, appears very well made, and the actual connector looks very similar to my older $65 HDMI cable that I purchased about 5 years ago when I believed all the marketing hype. I&rsquo;m a techie, I love electronics, I build my own computers, and I spend hours &ldquo;tuning&rdquo; brand new TVs. I love this stuff. My education is in industrial engineering &ndash; not electrical engineering. But I believe I have enough knowledge to recognize a well designed, well crafted HDMI cable. I&rsquo;m very surprised you can buy this type of quality for the Amazon.com&rsquo;s asking price. Great purchase.</p>

<h5 id="two-cords-broken-after-3-months-of-normal-use">Two cords broken after 3 months of normal use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought two of these cords at the end of February. By May (less than 3 months), both are broken and one is completely not able to be used.We keep one plugging the Xbox to the TV. With any small jostle, the connection is lost and you have to wiggle the cord to get it to read again.We kept one plugged into the TV and occasionally would plug in a laptop to project a movie or something onto the TV. After perhaps a dozen times plugging/unplugging from the laptop (gently/normal use), the whole gold connector came off. I was just past the return window, so I did not bother trying to return them. However, I have to say I am really disappointed in this product. I guess you get what you pay for, and these were cheap and cheaply made. I bought a new cord, but this time I went with a different company.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-jury-is-still-out">The jury is still out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these because of the &ldquo;Ethernet&rdquo; mention in the name. Frankly I&rsquo;m not certain how these differ from a traditional HDMI cable. I have a 3D TV though and since this said it &ldquo;supports 3D&rdquo; I thought maybe there was something better about it. I was using a regular HDM cable before with my 3D TV and it seems to have &ldquo;supported&rdquo; the 3D every bit as much as this cable does so maybe I was sold a bill of goods. In any event, it would be wrong to not give it a good rating because it works as advertised. I hope to do some research and find out what, if any benefit there is to the &ldquo;Ethernet and 3D Support&rdquo; there is to this cable over a &ldquo;regular HDMI cable.</p>
