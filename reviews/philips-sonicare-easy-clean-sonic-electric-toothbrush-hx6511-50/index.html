Product Description
From the makers of the number one recommended power toothbrush brand by dental professionals, philips sonicare introduces easyclean. Featuring sonicare’s patented sonic technology, dynamic cleaning action drives fluid between teeth and along the gum line. The new easyclean removes up to 2x more plaque than a manual toothbrush. Easyclean includes 1 sonicare toothbrush handle, 1 standard proresults brush head, 1 charger base, and 1 hygienic travel cap. Easyclean is the easy way to improve your oral health. Ease of use features include smart timer, quadpacer, snap on brush head, recharge indicator, and easy- start. Sonicare helps reduce gingivitis and is proven safe on orthodontics, dental work, veneers, implant material, and sensitive teeth.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Taking care of your oral health is easy with the Philips Sonicare EasyClean Toothbrush. Utilizing patented Sonic technology, this rechargeable power toothbrush features a slim, easy-to-clean handle and a ProResults brush head with contoured bristles that gently remove plaque in hard-to-reach areas. An Easy-start feature helps you acclimate to the Sonicare experience, and the Smartimer and Quadpacer ensure you brush adequately and evenly. For further convenience, the EasyClean toothbrush remains charged for up to two weeks, a great feature for traveling.</p>

<p>Better reach for a better clean.

<p>Gently Cleans Teeth with Sonic Technology
Unlike a manual toothbrush, the Philips Sonicare EasyClean uses powerful Sonic technology to clean teeth with up to 31,000 movements per minute. These sweeping motions drive fluids deep into the tight spaces between your teeth and along your gum line, resulting in a cleaner, healthier mouth.</p>

<p>ProResults Brush Head Removes Plaque Along the Gum Line
With contoured bristles that correspond to the natural shape of your teeth, the Sonicare EasyClean delivers a thorough, comfortable brushing experience. Its ProResults brush head has extra-soft rounded bristles that clean along the gum line, removing disease-causing plaque for a more thorough clean.</p>

<p>For added convenience, the ProResults brush head snaps onto the handle for easier brush-head replacement and handle cleaning.</p>

<p>Easy-Start, Smartimer, and Quadpacer Simplify Brushing
The EasyClean makes it easy to care for your oral health. You need to apply only light pressure when using this toothbrush&ndash;the Sonicare EasyClean will do the brushing for you. For further convenience, the Sonicare EasyClean Toothbrush features an Easy-start feature that gently increases the toothbrush&rsquo;s power automatically over the first 14 uses, so you can gradually adjust to the Sonic technology.</p>

<p>The Sonicare EasyClean Toothbrush also features two timers to keep you on track. The Smartimer encourages you to brush for a full two minutes, the time recommended by dental professionals, while the Quadpacer beeps in 30-second intervals to make sure you thoroughly brush all four quadrants of your mouth. If you wish to pause or stop during brushing, just press the power button. If you press the power button again within 30 seconds, the timers will pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>Smartimer
After 2 minutes, the Smartimer automatically switches off the toothbrush. To pause or stop brushing during the 2-minute cycle, press the on/off button. If you press the on/off button again within 30 seconds, the Smartimer picks up where you left off.</p>

<p>Quadpacer
The Quadpacer is an interval timer. At 30, 60 and 90 seconds, you hear a short beep and pause in the brushing action. This is your signal to move to the next section of your mouth.</p>

<p>Two Weeks of Power on a Single Charge
After a full 24-hour charge, the Sonicare EasyClean Toothbrush will provide approximately two weeks of typical use (two minutes of brushing, twice a day). A convenient recharge indicator on the brush displays the available battery life and blinks when you need to recharge.</p>

<p>Because the EasyClean Toothbrush can last two weeks between charges, you can leave its charger at home for most of your travels. A hygienic travel cap is included for further on-the-go convenience.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box
Toothbrush, Standard ProResults brush head, charger base, and travel cap.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-actually-works">It actually works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical about buying this because I was doing a good job with my manual toothbrush. This electric does a better job of doing my back molars and it reaches deeper in between the teeth. My teeth feel noticeably cleaner with this as opposed to a manual brush. Battery lasts for many brushes on a single charge.I bought this specific model because the higher priced models from Sonicare are a waste of money. The higher end models are the same hardware, but with a different outer skin and more software programming. The extra software options are not useful: they just vary the length of time and lower the intensity of the brushing action. Most people will not use these extra &ldquo;features.&rdquo; If you need more time, you can turn the brush on again. Lowering the intensity defeats the purpose of an electric brush. A lower intensity is only useful if your teeth are very sensitive due to poor hygiene or due to injury.The lower end models use the older style brush heads. I don&rsquo;t know for how long Sonicare will continue to provide replaceable heads for those, so I went with the cheapest model that uses the newest heads.Sonicare&rsquo;s highest end model (DiamondClean) claims to clean even better than this model. That is only true of the brush head that model comes with. Those particular DiamondClean brush heads are compatible with this EasyClean model and can be purchased separately; therefore, cleaning performance between the two models are exactly the same.Bottom line: This EasyClean model is the only model I recommend. Anything more expensive does not really provide anything extra (despite what the marketing department wants you to believe), and anything less expensive uses the old brush heads.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used Philips Sonicare elect. toothbrushes for years. This is the first toothbrush of theirs that solves my problems with the other designs. This EasyClean 500 Series has a slim compact handle&ndash;slimmer than any of the others I have used. Love it! And the best design change they made is the easy-to-clean attachment of the brush head to the handle. The brush head has a very small attachment connecting mechanism: simply a very small recess in the bottom of the brush head component that pushes onto a slim metal rod in the handle. Finally no cavities to harbor mold, grim, old toothpaste, saliva, etc. I was shocked and disgusted when I pried open the insides of my old brush head bottom&ndash;I had to use a screw driver to pop off a plastic disc up inside the old brush attachment. They should have made these changes years ago!</p>

<h5 id="the-macbook-pro-of-sonicares">The Macbook Pro of Sonicares</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased 4 Sonicares since 2011Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Toothbrush June 2011 $136.99Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush February 2012 $156.11Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush October 2012 $136.24Philips Sonicare HX6921/02 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush January 2014 $155.99First of all, I am an idiot. These Sonicares come with a 2 year warranty. I should have been returning these toothbrushes whenever they broke. That aside&hellip;.As you can see, the first Sonicare lasted 8 months, the second one lasted 8 months, the third one lasted 15 months, and the fourth one lasted 20 months. None of them lasted 2 years. These things break fast. And they&rsquo;re expensive.When my last Sonicare broke, I was tired of paying so much money for brushes that kept breaking. Did I really need 5 cleaning modes? I&rsquo;ve owned Sonicares for 4 years, and I personally have never used any cleaning mode except Regular and Gum Care (which just adds an extra minute).Seeing that Sonicare had discontinued its old models, I thought that I would just purchase a &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; model from their new line up. So in September 2015 I bought a Philips Sonicare 3 Series Gum Health HX6631/02 for $84.95. That thing was like brushing your teeth with a chain saw, it was that loud.Frustrated with the inflated prices of the newer models, and the spectacular failure of my one attempt at using a cheaper version of one of these new models, I purchased an older, discontinued model, the Easy Clean.This toothbrush reminds me of a Macbook Pro. Unibody. One mode, one button. Whisper quiet. It just works. You can feel how sturdy it is. It doesn&rsquo;t feel delicate like the more expensive models with more electrical doodads that might breakAlso, so far, none of that &ldquo;gunk between the brush and the head&rdquo; that plagues Sonicare. The brush head fits snugly on the brush body, which is why it&rsquo;s so quiet.I&rsquo;ve only had this Sonicare Easy Clean a month, so I may change my review in the future if this dies on me early. But I&rsquo;ve already knocked it over a few times, and this brush just shrugged it off with a &ldquo;meh&rdquo; and kept working.As someone who was tried many different Sonicares, I would highly recommend this model, and only this model.</p>

<p>Excellent value and love how clean my teeth feel. The toothbrush allows you to ramp up gently to full power if you are not used to an electric toothbrush. After a few weeks of use, gums already feel healthier and less sensitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="prone-to-breaking">Prone to breaking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased two of these and had the same breakage issue each time &ndash; the metal insert that holds the brush to the handle will pop out when changing the toothbrush head. It cannot be re-inserted to restore full functionality.I thought I had simply not taken care of the item the first time I had this issue, but the same breakage occurred even when I was very careful to keep my second purchase dry and corrosion-free. Each time the toothbrush lasted me less than 6 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sonic-all-the-way">Sonic all the way</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first try at a sonic brush, takes a little getting used to but worth the practice. My teeth feel cleaner after using. Battery lasts insane amount of time between charges. I use it 2x a day and charge it once every 3rd week. Highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="did-not-last-long-enough-to-justify-high-price">Did not last long enough to justify high price.</h5>
