<h5 id="best-professional-gun">Best professional gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The KP5 CMO23 by far is the best gun I&rsquo;ve owned. The fps is definitely higher than it is labeled. The gun comes with a warranty paper, instructions, silencer (attachable and detachable) a speed loader, one standard KP5 mag and a super mag that allows you to continuously fire bbs, glasses, battery w/ charger, attachable scope, adjustable stock and a sling. The battery literally last forever and remember to not charge over 4 hours once it dies or you&rsquo;ll have a mess to pick up fyi. The gun has a semi and full auto option and safety that is made of metal. The gun is 1:1 size as a real KP5 and fires just as fast. The mag holds somewhere around 23 bbs and the gun is definitely bigger than I thought. The gun is made mostly of plastic but the thing that separates this gun from others is that this is not cheap plastic it is very heavy for and airsoft gun and takes about a week to be delivered if you live in the central U.S. Also, the gun has metal parts and the battery is to go were the hand grip is (the part where your non dominant hand goes) thei is a little switch to open it up and put the battery in. The battery comes charged. (The scope is a real scope and has an on/off switch for built in laser reticule. Best gun out of my 8 electrics. If your worried this isn&rsquo;t a good gun don&rsquo;t be its the next best thing to a real KP5. HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL!</p>

<h5 id="day-late-and-broke">Day late and broke.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Showed up a day later than the latest estimated delivery time and it was broke. Still shoots, therefore my son wants to keep it, but the tip is broke off so you can&rsquo;t screw the attachments to it. The &ldquo;manual&rdquo; was poorly translated from Chinese (?), so there was confusion about how to charge the batteries before the first use. Here is a sample of what it said, word for word: &ldquo;DO NOT OVER CHARGE YOUR BATTERY. Charge Most Battery no more THAN 4 HOURS&hellip;&rdquo; And then, &ldquo;Discharge the battery completely before charging it for the first time and the charging time is 12 hours.&rdquo; Then it said, &ldquo;Battery charging time is about 7-8 hours, do not extra to avoid the over-charge.&rdquo; Then, to top it off it read &ldquo;The temperature can&rsquo;t over 45 (degrees) during charging or will damage to the battery. Rechargeable batteries air not to be removed from the toy before being recharged (if removed).&rdquo; Huh?! Other than that, it looks and feels much cheaper than the $40 we paid for it. Hope nothing else breaks on it very soon.</p>

<h5 id="cyma-mp5-review">CYMA MP5 review.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am rating this aeg five stars for many reasons. The first has to be the price, but don&rsquo;t let the price fool you, it is cheap and really good. The quality of this gun is more than excellent for the price, but good for airsoft in general. The plastic is textured and doesn&rsquo;t feel flimsy at all. The stock has low wobble and multiple positions, but beware the stock position locking piece is sketchy, a little wobbly and sometimes doesn&rsquo;t lock into place until you move the stock just right, this might be the locking piece or the stock is just very precise. The sling sucks and the sling mounts don&rsquo;t look great but I have yet to break one. The iron sights are not adjustable, but are accurate. The selector switch is great with a nice click, and the trigger response is great but make sure you complete the shot or it could stop right before it actually shoots the round. The front grip houses the 7.2 small battery, but is secure and no wobble. The cocking arm is great although it does nothing, and the flash hider is horrible but you can take it off and the threaded barrel is orange so you can leave it just like that or add the suppressor. The stick mag can be touchy if you aren&rsquo;t careful, the dual mag high cap is nice but it doesn&rsquo;t like to shoot the last 40 or so pellets. Your scopes are NOT broke, it just requires some construction with pieces included in the small parts baggy. My red dot sucks though because it blinds me more than it helps me see. The internals aren&rsquo;t that bad. The gearbox is plastic, but for being a plastic gearbox it works really good. Even better it has a hop-up adjustment on the right side of the gun, and if you adjust it correctly it will shoot beautifully. I would only recommend this for small games at most, no big or &ldquo;pro&rdquo; games. I hope this review helps you with your purchase decision of this gun.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it">I like it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun gunn to shoot. 180+ rounds one one refill. only one jam over several hours of play. most likely human error. very accurate for low FPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-beginners-or-show">For beginners or show.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This gun is okay because of the fact that it shoots slow, scope is bright and blurry and the scope rail is kinda annoying because you have to screw it on and off but it is better than it being loose. Also the gun&rsquo;s screw broke easily when applying the mock suppressor.The good part is the handle pops off for an easy access to the battery which lasts for a long time. It comes with a decent speed-loader, and safety goggles (little big). The two mags are great and easy to use with a long mag that holds around 30-40 bbs and a stubby mag with extra storage space to store at least 80 give or take bbs. The iron sights are great and a sweet adjustable stock.Suggest this gun for beginners.</p>

<h5 id="the-gun-was-shooting-fine-until-about-3-hours-later">The gun was shooting fine until about 3 hours later</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Right when I took this out of the box, the orange tip was broken off, that made it for me now illegal to carry around openly. The gun was shooting fine until about 3 hours later, that whole time I was using the extended mag, finally the gun just stopped shooting bbs. At first I thought it was the gun at that broke, but it was actually the mag. The bbs were getting jammed inside, so I took it apart and got all the bbs out, then it happend again. So now I use the banna mag so with this mag i have to put every single bb in, one at a time. BUT the mags were extremely hard to put into the gun too. That was a huge bummer. So then I was stuck with the banana mag. I thought it wouldt be bad, but they didnt give me the bb loader for that mag.PROS: Good Fps, Durable, Light.CONS:Mags SUCK, Not a responsible company, Plastic Gearbox, can get frustrating when gun gets jammed.I would only buy this gun if the mags were durable and the accessories were better.DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE OLDER THEN 10i SAY THIS CAUSE KIDS CAN DEAL WITH PUTTING IN ONE BB AT A TIME</p>
