<h5 id="no-more-batteries-necessary-a-lightweight-mobile-mouse-i-can-take-anywhere-anytime">No more Batteries Necessary&hellip; a lightweight mobile mouse, I can take anywhere, anytime</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been looking for a wireless mouse that would replace my old one. The Huluwa wireless mouse is an excellent choice. It is very light and portable, it is so convenient to transport. I work with a laptop most of the day and need I love the fact that this mouse is so easy to pack up with my laptop. Functionality, it glides easily without drag, making working multiple projects and screens a breeze.Scroll button rolls smoothly with no problems. Cleans easily, wiping free of fingerprints and crumbs. In addition, I don&rsquo;t need to replace the battery because it has a built-in-battery that is rechargeable. I hate it when my mouse starts dying because of the battery and I don&rsquo;t have any spare to use. This is a great wireless mouse for my everyday use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="portable-mouse">Portable Mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I just received a new laptop for work and was in need of a new wireless mouse. I came across this portable mobile mouse from Huluwa and thought this would work perfectly due to the claim that this mouse was made to reduce noise. Product arrived as scheduled and product was not damaged during delivery. Once product arrived I charged it for a bit before use. Once it was charged set-up was super easy to use mouse and was compatible with my HP laptop. Mouse last for a long time before I needed to recharge it again. When using the mouse, it glides so easy across the desk without drag. Usually with different mouse’s in my work place all you can hear is the clicking of mouse’s being made. The great thing about this mouse is that it was built to reduce noise. Perfect when you are working at home and you don’t want to wake up the baby. Overall I am completely satisfied with this purchase due to the quality material that this is made from and the stylish color that it is offered in.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-an-inphic-brand-mouse-not-huluwa">This is an inphic brand mouse-not Huluwa</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I compared this mouse to the one branded as inphic on Amazon and chose this one because the reviews seemed to fair better even though it was a few dollars more. I received it only to discover it appears to be the exact same mouse. The packaging and product have inphic labels. I checked the product page again and although the item name says Huluwa, if you zoom in on the images of the mouse, you can make out the inphic logo. Shouldn&rsquo;t have to look that hard and I&rsquo;m irritated I spent $2 more for what appears to be the exact same product.That said, the mouse works fine. It feels cheap but that could also be because its so lightweight without batteries. I haven&rsquo;t checked yet to see how long it holds a charge. That could potentially be annoying but it is also a nice idea that I don&rsquo;t ever have to change out the batteries, just recharge it. It&rsquo;s a nice pink gold color, responds well, works decent on multiple surface types without a mouse pad, and the click is quite silent. It&rsquo;s an inexpensive mouse that seems to do what it was intended to do but I don&rsquo;t expect it will be very durable. If the the silent click, wireless and rechargeable features appeal to you, its a decent purchase.</p>

<h5 id="buy-one-for-each-computer">Buy one for each computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice maus with a different form factor from your standard maus. This one is flat. I had ordered this for my laptop because the flatness makes for a nice fit in my carrying case.For me it took a bit of getting used to after 20 years of fat mauses. Eventually I liked this maus so much that I bought two more for the other computers in the house. The good thing about using this on multiple systems is that they don&rsquo;t interfere with each other. I can have my laptop in the same room as one of the desktops and each mouse will only control the computer it&rsquo;s dongle is in.My system is very persnickety about USB devices. Some of them take along time to get recognized, and some never. This device was recognized immediately by my Windows 7 desktop and my Windows 8 laptop.I&rsquo;m not crazy about the puce color, I&rsquo;d prefer mauve. But functionality is all-important, and this is where this maus excels. The clickers and wheel have a good feel. I only hope this thing has resiliency and lasts a long time.When it is not used for a while it goes into a sleep mode so that the battery doesn&rsquo;t drain when not in use. It is awakened by a click.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-read-good-reviews-so-i-thought-i-will-give-it-a">I have read good reviews so I thought I will give it a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My old mouse was malfunctioning so I have thought of buying a new one and I came across this cute rose gold portable mouse at a very reasonable price. I have read good reviews so I thought I will give it a shot. This item arrived yesterday and I was very happy when I opened the box because it looks nicer than expected. I immediately tried it on my laptop and it does an excellent job! This mouse glides easily and the scroll buttons rolls smoothly. This is definitely a good mouse for daily use. I have been using it since last night up to now, it is now lunchtime and so far I did not encounter any problems. This definitely deserves my five star rating.</p>

<h5 id="lightweight-and-durable">Lightweight and durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This computer mouse is great, the quality of the mouse is very good, Its slim attractive design makes it very light in its movement, but not so much that it leads you to believe it is flimsyI have found it is very comfortable to use, especially if it is being used for over an hour in one sitting.One of my favorite features is that the mouse is whisper quite, it makes no annoying clicking sound whatsoever it takes a little getting use to but it is a great and unique feature.Another positive feature is that the mouse has a button that can be used to adjust the mouse’s DPI. After a quick google search I found that DPI stands for Dots Per Inch. The DPI button is used to adjust the mouse’s pointer speed, making it very easy to adjust the mouse’s speed to your desired preference.The set up was easy, simply charge it up with the included cable, plug in the USB receiver to any laptop/desktop give it a few minutes and your good to go.All in all, I find this mouse as a great fit for any average computer user.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-light-weight">Pretty, light weight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pretty, light weight easy to use. True to the rose gold color. The usb was a tad difficult to remove but I may be because I wasn&rsquo;t sure and was afraid to break it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-last-long">battery last long</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it that it is rechargeable and the battery last for a very long time. I&rsquo;ve had it for about 2 weeks and still haven&rsquo;t charged it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shape is a little weird and uncomfortable at first, but that&rsquo;s OK since I picked it because of its low profile. After a few weeks you actually get used to it.</p>
