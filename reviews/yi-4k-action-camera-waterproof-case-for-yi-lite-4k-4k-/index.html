<h5 id="works-great-but-lens-seems-to-scratch-fairly-easily">Works great! But lens seems to scratch fairly easily.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked well, no leaks, on several dives between 19-14 metersEdit: Notice lens is scratched. It seems rather fragile&hellip; granted I didn&rsquo;t take particularly good care of it, but on the other hand I haven&rsquo;t seen scratches like this on my GoPro/clone cases which I&rsquo;ve treated the same way. It may be random chance, or because this is flat, whereas the others are curved? I don&rsquo;t think the scratches I have affect picture quality, they&rsquo;re small and near the edges of the lens, but it&rsquo;s disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-breaks-unfortunately">It breaks, unfortunately.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Case looks decent, but unfortunately within one week hinges started to break. I noticed cracks which enlarged every day. Now I am afraid to use it in a water.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="case-for-an-action-cam-but-you-know-this">Case for an action cam, but you know this.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little action cam waterproof case. I have read stories about the hinge being flimsy or brittle though I have not found that to be the case. If this is truly a concern for you, simply cover the latch with a good quality duct tape (like 3M, not some random store brand) or even go a step further and lay a piece of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; closed or open cell foam underneath the quack tape. It very much IS fully waterproof, fits my 4k+ wonderfully and appears to be made of a very nice acrylic or polycarb (not sure which). If you have an action cam that does work outside your windshield or body and water is a concern, get it. The price is right.Pls note, I know there are other brands of various products intended to work with the YI products. It has been my experience that YI accessories tend to work best with YI products. The only exception being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HM8L0Z6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HM8L0Z6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a> . I even have a couple of Newmowas batts for my GH5, but thats another review, in both cases. JM2C folks, take it as you will.EDIT - I realize I should have addressed the scratching. Confirmation bias seems to play a role in some reviews, but if you are honest about things, consumers tend to be more vocal when UNhappy than when happy. If you really look into the scratching issue, in other words, pour through lots of gopro product reviews, I believe you will find roughly the same percentage of folks saying that the gopros scratch as well. Notice I said roughly, the reason being, again, confirmation bias.When more money is spent, most consumers will want to know they were right in spending the greater sum of money and this is measurably true (and documented) in other consumer product segments. In this case, it is about a 100% increase in cost. I have no problem with gopro, I have numerous friends with various models, many of whom complain nonstop about the manner in which they evolve and the price associated with each evolution (think iPhone), yet continue to buy gp products. I get it, I do, I just went with YI instead.On scratching&hellip;. I have not had an issue with this YET, it will happen, at some point, this is a virtual guarantee. At this time however, after a few weeks of heavy use, rolling around in a backpack with outdoor gear, in a dittybox in my truck, various other locales outside of the little YI case (bout the size of a VHS case), falling on gravel roads and in actual use, I have yet to get any scratches. That has been my experience so far.It is worth noting however, those scratches, WILL &ldquo;buff right out&rdquo;. All you need is basic car paint polish (non abrasive style which most low end consumer lever stuff is, like Megs 3 part system, or Mothers 3 part system), some 300GSM or greater microfiber, and patience. True story kids.No go make some insane videos.</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly Recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw on the review some people complain about this product. I just took it to Tulum Mexico. Had my yi 4k camera, placed in this waterproof case, in the deep sea and the pool for hours and soon as I got home and took my yi camera out its as dry as I had it before I put it in the case.And when I had it in the pool which I was in for at least 6 hours. I had it tied on my risk with another product under the water the whole time because I was tired of carrying it in my hand. This product is perfect. Now I&rsquo;m heading to Jamaica and I&rsquo;m going to use it all over again. 5 stars for protecting my expensive product. oh yea and one more thing..I used it on the trip as a protection case when I was out the water throughout Mexico since they yi camera looks pretty delicate. And it was easy to use in the &ldquo;In house mode&rdquo; while in the case. My 10 year old used it with no problem and took great video. Highly recommended</p>

<h5 id="does-exactly-what-it-s-supposed-to-but-could-do-a-little-more">Does exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to, but could do a little more&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is GREAT! With winter comes snow (aka frozen water) and with this case I don&rsquo;t hesitate to put my camera places that the slightest mistake could result in water damage. I walked out on to a frozen lake without the slightest concern that if the ice broke, my camera would be destroyed. I stuck it into a thawing waterfall without a second thought (it even fell over into a puddle). I wouldn&rsquo;t even consider getting my DSLR anywhere near these types of places.The only problem is that I control the YI 4K from my phone app. They connect via Wifi. And that&rsquo;s the problem. Wifi doesn&rsquo;t transmit through water. So, if they were able to fix that (maybe a metal strip inside the case that has a water sealed plugged and then we could plug a wire into that? That might allow the wifi signal to travel outside of the water. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not an engineer).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-case">Okay case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case protects the Yi 4K really well. So far I have not had any issues in regards to water. However, as I was closing and locking the waterproof case, a crack appeared. I was a little diasappointed by I hope it doesn&rsquo;t not cause my camera to get wet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-case-and-fits-my-yi-4k-camera-perfectly">This is a great case and fits my YI 4K camera perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great case and fits my YI 4K camera perfectly. It&rsquo;s actually so snug that sometimes I feel like I have to force the back into place when I am closing it. So far, no issues with taking my camera underwater. I almost have an urge to keep it in this case as there are no other options for a carrying case thus far. Microphone is a bit dimmer with the case on (as expected) but can still hear some talking at close range.Honestly, the case does what you expect from it: Keeps the water from damaging your new action camera. There are third party cases out there, but I personally feel better using an official case to protect my investment.</p>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got scratches on the second day of usage on plastic and glass. Unexpectedly low quality</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Good</p>

<p>Unfortunately this case is garbage because of the top latch is made out of cheap plastic that becomes brittle and breaks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it in a saltwater pool without any problems! Just make sure you rinse off with clean fresh tap water and dry well afterwards to prevent rust.</p>

<p>Much better build quality than my previous 3rd party case for my Yi 4KMajor downside is that the microphone doesn&rsquo;t pick up audio - my previous (now chewed by the dog)&hellip;</p>
