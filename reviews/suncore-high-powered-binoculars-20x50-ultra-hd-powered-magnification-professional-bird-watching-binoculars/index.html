<h5 id="easy-to-use-and-focus-but-no-scale-for-quick-adjustments-not-waterproof">Easy to use and focus, but no scale for quick adjustments, not waterproof</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE 5/26/2017: I was miffed that the unit I received listed the wrong specs on the box and the vendor hadn’t caught the error, but when I let them know they went ahead and updated all their packaging so there would be less confusion.You’ll receive a neoprene carry bag with a shoulder strap, the binoculars, two microfiber cleaning cloths, an instruction sheet, and a lanyard. The binoculars are pretty heavy, weighing just over two pounds. They measure about 8”W x 7”L x 2.5”H. The binoculars have rubber lens caps on the front and back lenses. The ones on the front are tethered so you don’t lose them, but the ones over the eye lens are not attached so make sure you keep track of them. The width, or IPD, of the binoculars is easy to set by pulling the two tubes out or pressing them together. The instructions state there are supposed to be markings so that you can quickly set the binoculars for next time, but the ring between the eye lenses only shows a few dashes and dots that aren’t that helpful for this purpose. I found them difficult to see and set accurately without a real scale and prefer ones that have line markings in contrasting colors.Focusing each eye independently is easily achieved by following the directions but again, there’s supposed to be a scale for the right eyecup so you can set it to that position quickly next time, but all you see is a plus, minus, and a dot with no reference points. In fact the rubber eye cup can be removed and re-positioned without adjusting the focus (and sometimes moves during twisting) which makes these markings useless.However, once both eyes are focused you can look with both eyes and the image should be clear. As you look around at things that are closer or farther away, you can re-focus by turning the dial in the middle. With these binoculars, you won’t be able to focus on objects that are less than 15 feet away but you should be able to focus on things about 150 feet away. The binoculars don&rsquo;t appear to focus to infinity for things that are really far away (not great for night or celestial viewing) Other than the missing scales for the adjustments, the binoculars are easy to set and use. They seem to work well, although sometimes the eye pieces tend to fog up and they are quite heavy so it gets tiring to hold them. You could use them for bird watching, sporting events, and even live performances, but remember that they are not waterproof if you plan to use them outdoors.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-binoculars">Great value binoculars.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I have a Bushnell&rsquo;s binocular and I think this one is much better in term of the quality. The coating is really nice and it has smooth adjustment. It is a stable binoculars because it has anti-shake. My Bushnell&rsquo;s image is kind of shaky and it create dizziness sometimes but I can&rsquo;t blame the binocular because it could be my hands that create the shakiness. As for right now I would say this is another great value binoculars. Please watch my video for the unboxing experience.If you think my video is helpful, please do give me a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I am grateful if you can. Thank you.</p>

<h5 id="defective-binoculars-double-image-when-viewed-no-problem">defective binoculars. double image when viewed. no problem &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>defective binoculars. double image when viewed. no problem with getting refund through Amazon. that&rsquo;s why i continue to buy from amazon</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-advertised-magnification-closer-to-10-not-20">Not as advertised, magnification closer to 10, not 20</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received these to replace a set of 10x50 - wanted more magnification. They seem well made, and the image is clear. One problem, they are advertised as 20x50 and they are most certainly not. Tested side by side against 10x50, magnification is virtually identical. Otherwise they seem like decent binoculars at a decent price so haven&rsquo;t decided if I&rsquo;m going to return them or not. But to reiterate, they are not as advertised, so 2 stars. If they were advertised as 10x50, would probably rate as 4 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-binoculars-for-hunting-season">Great binoculars for hunting season.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband needed new binoculars for hunting this season. This pair was exactly what he was looking for. They are HD quality and have a mice finish. It has a 20x50 focus to get sharp precise details. The best part of this pair is that they are waterproof. They are also fog proof. This helps when my husband is out in the early and late hours of the day. With lots of humidity in the area, it is good to know that it won’t affect his binoculars. It is really nice that the rings on both they eye and rubber rings protect lens ends of the binoculars in case they fall. My husband has used his exclusively for almost a year and a half now and they still look new. The eyepieces are adjustable so this one pair of binoculars is fun for the whole family. We are all able to adjust they eyepieces and see the desired point without hesitation. It is very easy to adjust the zoom. It is a smooth dial to turn and does not shake or blur the site when making adjustments. The neck strap is an added measure to help from dropping them and to be hands free when moving around. I think we will get a second pair!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-product">Awesome product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend gifted me this awesome binocular. I thought it seem usual like other products but it is extremely wonderful product. I enjoyed a lot with this binocular for sightseeing even in fog because it has fog proof clarity. Sleek model impressed me a lot. I really love this binocular a lot&hellip;. It deserves 5star ratings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-weather-binoculars-great-for-outdoors">all-weather binoculars great for outdoors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are Sleek and Solid Rubber finish for shock-resistance THEY are Waterproof, all-weather binoculars great for outdoors. use even under severe conditions theyhave comfortable grip, durable and portable for outdoors. I wpuld recommend them</p>
