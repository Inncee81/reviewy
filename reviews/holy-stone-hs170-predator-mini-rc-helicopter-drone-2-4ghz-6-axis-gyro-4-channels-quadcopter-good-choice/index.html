<h5 id="there-are-better-options">There are better options.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The drone is difficult to control unless you&rsquo;re in a wide open field. It does not hover. I recommend the Syma X11. Furthermore, the company offers a $5 gift card for writing a review of the product. When I gave them <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars they emailed me and called me stating that they would not give me the gift card until I wrote a higher review. This completely explains why there are so many excellent product reviews but the product is average at best. Do not buy.</p>

<h5 id="everything-is-not-what-it-may-appear-to-be-caveat-emptor">Everything is NOT what it may appear to be&hellip;. Caveat Emptor!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave this produce a 4 star review originally. It was my first drone and I think the product seemed pretty self-explanatory, despite the less than easy to understand instruction booklet.I charged it using the USB. Easy enough. I put the batteries in the remote control. Easy enough.Flew it, was slightly difficult to navigate, but it was my first time doing it. Lasted 5-8 minutes, like package said.Flew it again on the field, where there is soft grass. It fell onto the grass a couple of times.Then, the transmitter and the drone wouldn&rsquo;t connect. So I called customer service.Got a call from a guy named Winston within minutes. He told me to charge the drone fully. Duh, like I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that before.I was surprised to get a call on a Friday night at 7pm from a local number in La Puente, CA (626) 465-7134. He was very nice, speaking in broken English, but I think we managed to chat ok.He asked me to write a 5 star review on Amazon. I told him I already submitted a 4 star review. He asked me to change it.I asked him how I could get my drone working again. He said it sounded like the circuit board probably broke.He states he will be happy to send me a new drone and transmitter, if I could &ldquo;help him out&rdquo; by filling out more reviews. I told him Amazon would only let me post one review per product. Then, he states he will email me a link to the Holy Stone company website, where I can post a review about his excellent customer service. I said I&rsquo;d be happy to, given he did call and speak to me late in the evening on a Friday after all.I emailed him back, b/c all the links he sent me were to Amazon&rsquo;s website, none to Holy Stone&rsquo;s. I told him I revised my original 4 star Amazon rating to a 5, based on customer service thus far.He then asked me why I hadn&rsquo;t reviewed the other Holy Stone products which he had sent a link to. I told him I didn&rsquo;t post reviews on the other products b/c the only product I purchased from Holy Stone was the HS 170 Predator.Then his tone turned a lot more negative. He said he thought we agreed that if I posted excellent reviews, then he would ask his &ldquo;finance&rdquo; dept to send me a new drone and transmitter. He said he didn&rsquo;t see any reviews from me, so he said thanks for doing what I could, and that he will do what he can as well. It felt more like a passive-aggressive veiled threat more than anything.Honestly, even if he does send me a new drone in good faith &ndash;&gt; I am revising my review to 1 star based on the fact that the product stopped working after 10 minutes in normal flying conditions, and because the customer service, while promptly responsive, was geared solely on getting as many 5 star reviews for their products, regardless of whether they were bonafide, genuine, ethical reviews or not.I don&rsquo;t want to do business with a company like that. And I am hoping that Amazon will take these 1 star and 2 star reviews seriously, b/c I have my doubts as to whether this company&rsquo;s product truly deserves so many 5 star reviews. Overall, I am quite disappointed as an Amazon Prime member&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="junk-do-not-buy">Junk! Do not buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not buy. It is junk. The whole thing is slipshod from the start. It was broke within a day of normal usage. Repairs are not easily made. The wires are soldered and there is no way to connect any other way.I should have realized this the moment I learned that instead of pressing a switch to turn on the drone, you actually connect the battery wires to the drone to turn it on.It is NOT worth the $40 they are asking for. If this was a $5 or $7 purchase, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<h5 id="read-this-or-you-ll-think-it-s-crappy">READ THIS OR YOU&rsquo;LL THINK IT&rsquo;S CRAPPY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>READ THIS TO CLARIFY BAD REVIEWS!!!!I just recently got my HS170, and at first I thought the same thing that everyone else states in their one-star reviews. It was lurching forward unless I pulled back on the controller and I was super annoyed thinking it was a crappy product. READ THE MANUAL!! When you first get ready to fly, before taking off, pull both sticks on the controller towards you and to the left until the beep stops. Your drone will fly nearly perfect. If you still need to do some adjustments (which will be very minor), use the &ldquo;trim&rdquo; buttons that are near the right stick. These buttons will ever so slightly tilt the drone front/back or left/right until you&rsquo;ve got it hovering.Holy Stone is also a great company. When I got my drone, it flew itself into a wall within the first couple minutes of flying (because I didn&rsquo;t know I had to calibrate the gyro (what I talked about above)) and one of the motors got all screwy. I wrote them with hopes that they would maybe send a new motor to replace that one, and they wrote back in a few hours saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send you a new drone. No need to send in the old one, you can keep that one for spare parts!&ldquo;Good company and before you get your undies in a bunch, do the two things I said in the first paragraph. You&rsquo;ll be happy with it.</p>

<h5 id="great-drone-would-recommend">Great drone, would recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 6 year old son got this for Christmas and is his first Drone. First impression was great. The product was packaged well and instructions were clear to get us started.Having never flown one we started inside and had him fly it on his own. As expected we did a fair bit of crashing around in the house, nothing serious but learned quickly how sharp those little props can be on fingers. We ended up breaking a propeller and as it turns out, not only are there different color props for front and rear, there are also letters on each prop which have to go in a specific place or the drone will flip over repeatedly.Got that figured out and we were back in business. We then went outside and the drone worked great. Easy to hover, easy to maneuver and great practice for fine motor skills (for us and him). Flight time felt longer than advertised and we were having the drone doing flips in no time.Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the manual could have been more inclusive regarding prop replacement specifics and the illustrations on how to adjust trim on the remote could have been a bit clearer.Other than that I would fully recommend this as a first drone or if you want an indoor/outdoor or smallish drone just for fun. Great deal and a ton of fun.</p>
