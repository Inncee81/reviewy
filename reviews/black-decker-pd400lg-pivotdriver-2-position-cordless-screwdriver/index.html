Great for a wide range of household tasks, from assembling furniture to hanging pictures, mounting shelves, and much more, this screwdriver will quickly become your favorite go-to tool.
What makes the PD400LG so versatile is its pivoting design. The two-position handle rotates 180 degrees to give you easy access to confined areas. The pivoting motion also gives you optimum control and precision, so your screws go exactly where want them.</p>

<p>Designed with You in Mind
The PD400LG has numerous features that were designed with your comfort in mind. To start, this screwdriver is ergonomically designed to feel like a natural extension of your hand. A soft-grip, grooved handle provides feedback and a signature over-molded surround provides durability and ensures a controlled grip. What&rsquo;s more, a bottom pivoting trigger with upper hook eliminates finger dragging on the housing.</p>

<p>And for easy operation in a variety of conditions, this screwdriver features an integrated LED light ring that helps illuminate dark spaces. Also, on-board storage for the included double-ended bit ensures that you&rsquo;ll always have the two most common bit sizes available at your fingertips.</p>

<p>The PD400LG is backed by a two-year warranty.</p>

<h5 id="battery-does-not-last-put-a-note-in-your-planner-to-return-it-within-1-year-of-purchase">battery does not last, put a note in your planner to return it within 1 year of purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the previous version of this item and liked it. It was pretty powerful and lasted for about 8 years before the battery stopped holding a charge well enough to be useful. I got this one and within 6 months I noticed it wasn&rsquo;t holding a charge very well, but I only use it about once every month or 2 so that wasn&rsquo;t much of a problem. I also noticed it wasn&rsquo;t as powerful as the previous version, but again it was powerful enough for my needs. Now it has been a year and a half and it does not hold a charge long enough to loosen more than 1 or 2 screws, and it does that only if I charge it for several hours immediately before using it. If I charge it and stick it in my toolbox, a few days later when I try to use it I always find it is dead, which makes it pretty much useless, since the point of a cordless screwdriver is you can use it without having to have it plugged in. Of course it is past the time when I can return it, so I am out my money. If you are going to buy this, make a note in your calendar 1 year out to return it so you don&rsquo;t go past the return date by accident. The light is a nice feature, but if it won&rsquo;t hold a charge it is just an expensive piece of e-waste. Shame on you Black and Decker!!!!! If you&rsquo;re going to discontinue an item and come out with a new version, it should be an improvement, which this one is definitely not.</p>

<h5 id="save-your-money">Save your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to replace my original B&amp;D pivot screw driver. The other one is an earlier version. The torque on this model is not as good as the earlier model. BUT&hellip;..that&rsquo;s not the big problem. When I purchased this one, I charged the batteries overnight. I very just tigentened a few little machine screws in PVC. These screws were only <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; long. The next day I went to use the tool and the batteries were dead. I took it to the B&amp;D repair shop and they had B&amp;D send me a new replacement. Had the same issue with the replacement. The batteries will not hold a charge. I called B&amp;D and told my story. They told me the unit had to be plugged in all of the time when the unit is not in use. I must have 8 different tools that run on batteries. Not one tool has to be plugged in all ofthe time. Yes, some batteries will discharge over an extended period of time if not kept on charge, but not in one or two days.My two Craftsman battery operated drills sit for more than two weeks without being charged. I can still use the drill and the batteries act like they are fully charged.If you like wasting your money and buying junk, this is the product to buy. If you want a quality tool, stay away from this one.By the way, I do have numerous B&amp;D tools and they all work great. So don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m just coming down on B&amp;D. But B&amp;D has hit the bottom of the garbage can with this thing !Barry</p>

<h5 id="for-home-use-very-handy-and-works-well-nice-small-size">For home use, very handy and works well. Nice SMALL size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We find this SO handy, we got rid of our larger (way more expensive) larger cordless screw driver. If we need larger (more powerful), we use corded &hellip; but that is extremely rare. If I needed a screwdriver more often, I&rsquo;d probably want a better one. But for our home use, it&rsquo;s great.It is quite small and fits into your hand comfortable.They don&rsquo;t last forever, we are on our second. I&rsquo;m guessing the other was maybe 7 years old when it wouldn&rsquo;t hold a charge. But rechargeable batteries don&rsquo;t last forever so I still felt like it was well worth getting another.We love it SO much it is our standard &ldquo;house warming&rdquo; gift for family members, and have given these to many people.</p>

<h5 id="still-happy-with-this-tool">Still happy with this tool!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This replaced a black &amp; Decker driver I bought over 9 years ago, the battery in the old one would no longer hold a charge. In my work I have to remove and replace a lot of electric outlet &amp; switch plates this tool and it&rsquo;s predecessor do that very, very well. I had gotten used to the short battery life of the old one that I was surprised that this ran all day without a single &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo;. A tip for infrequent users, charge the battery regularly even if you are not using the tool and the battery will last longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-for-small-stuff">Works great for small stuff!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting you go and build a home with this little guy, but if you enjoy the ease of having something else do the tedious twisting, this works surprisingly well.I use it for both home and automotive applications, so it&rsquo;s taken a beating by now. I like it because it won&rsquo;t strip anything&hellip;it&rsquo;s not strong enough. The gearbox is tough enough to give things a little extra finishing twist as well, which is handy.The battery lasts well and recharges fast. This is a handy little tool for many things and I&rsquo;m glad I have it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="only-lasted-about-a-year">Only lasted about a year.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this because I am lazy and don&rsquo;t like screwing in screws when I was replacing a lot of electrical outlets. After I finished that project it mostly sat around with rare light use. Today I took it off the charger and tried to use on a metal screw and after turning twice it decided it didn&rsquo;t want to work any more. Guess I will have to buy something bigger with a replaceable battery.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have one of these purchased before but I lost the charger so decided to buy a new one. This way I can leave one charging while using the other! Perfect for my smaller &ldquo;women&rsquo;s&rdquo; hands and powerful enough for most uses. Fits comfortably with the buttons easy to reach! Obviously, I&rsquo;d buy it again since I have! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-impressed-less-powerful-then-my-previous-one-which-lasted-5-years">Not impressed. Less powerful then my previous one which lasted 5 years.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not as good as my previous drill. I am a scrapper girl so used daily.</p>
