<h5 id="fine-cables-nice-bonus-items">Fine cables, nice bonus items.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Possibly there are higher quality cables out there, but HDMI is a digital signal&ndash;either it gets there or it doesn&rsquo;t. These are doing the job just fine for me. The included bonus items are a nice touch. Turns out I didn&rsquo;t need a right-angle adapter today, but maybe I will in the future. The cable ties aren&rsquo;t the strongest ones available, but they&rsquo;re more than sufficient for the task of coiling up a little extra cable that&rsquo;s going to hang behind the components.Although it&rsquo;s not mentioned in the product description, my packages included a bonus little LED light keychain light. It turns out I used this several times while working inside my entertainment cabinet while installing my new TV, so it was much appreciated. Of course since it&rsquo;s not mentioned, maybe that&rsquo;s a limited time thing or something, so unless the description changes, don&rsquo;t count on getting that I guess.For essentially the same price as the Amazon basics cables, I don&rsquo;t know how you can go wrong with these.</p>

<h5 id="great-hdmi-cables-at-a-great-price">Great HDMI cables at a great price!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My third set of Twisted Vein cables. Every one of them has done exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.I really like the heavy duty strain relief on the back of the connector and the expando braid covering the cables. The cable itself seems to be well shielded and is reasonably thick AWG cable. I wish I could spare one to cut into it and see what the actual construction is. But, without doing that, all I can say is it&rsquo;s a well made cable that hasn&rsquo;t given any hint of noise problems, or other issues.I&rdquo;m using these in my KVM set up, and am extremely pleased! The additional R/A adapter and cable wraps are added niceties that add value to the whole package.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-package-value">Terrific package &amp; value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cables are well-made &amp; an excellent value. 90 degree connectors are extremely useful; it&rsquo;s great that they include.I assumed the keychain bonus would be a cheap throwaway, but it&rsquo;s actually better quality than what I&rsquo;d been carrying.Will definitely buy this brand again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-worth-the-price">well worth the price !!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these cables are far better than others. i am using them to connect my oppo bluray player and amazon fire tv and vizio uhd tv and onkyo receiver and they work perfect.the only thing i would like the manufactures of cables and componets make the fit of the plugs and the sockets tighter and with locking clips like on either net cables because some brands the plug gets loose or falls out easy losing signal and making you reinsert the cable.thesecables were better than the other 4 brands of cables i was using.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-deal-but-loose-connectors">Great Deal. but loose connectors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great package for a great price. I have used only one cable, but I had to use the 90 degree adapter just so the cable would make contact enough to provide a picture. The connectors on the cable ends are just too loose when attached to my Vizio TV, and the adapter provides enough resistance to keep the cable connected.Not sure that I would buy these again because of that.</p>

<h5 id="the-product-arrived-in-a-nice-glossy-box-with-images-of-what-was-inside">The product arrived in a nice glossy box with images of what was inside</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As most people do, I tend to write reviews more often when there is an issue with the product. In this case, it is the exact opposite. I want to compliment Twisted Veins on their product and outstanding packaging.The product arrived in a nice glossy box with images of what was inside, and it was easy to open. What I found inside was the best part. Not only did I receive the two HDMI cables and angle adapter I was expecting, I also found three branded velcro ties, a nice branded key chain LED flashlight, a micro fiber cleaning cloth, and a glossy foldout pamphlet showing everything in the package and their company/product information.The cables themselves seem to be of great quality, and nicely made. The cable ends were capped to protect them, and the cables were in a heavy duty sealed plastic bad.A+ for QualityA++ for packaging and presentation of products in the box.It is not often I am impressed by a company these days, but this one certainly did impress.</p>

<h5 id="replace-a-generic-lossy-hdmi-cable-with-these-and-resurrected-my-projector-with-a-solid-signal-christ-has-risen">Replace a generic lossy HDMI cable with these and resurrected my projector with a solid signal. Christ has risen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not one to actually buy nice HDMI cables. I assume these things are commoditized and can just get the cheapest ones from China to get the job done. However, my projected was having issues. I&rsquo;ve had it for 4 years and thought maybe it was the projector that was the issue since I had already replaced the receiver. Instead of spending $1000 for a new projector, I decided what the heck, I&rsquo;ll get some good quality cables and see if it&rsquo;s a signal loss thing. I got these guys, and upon open the packaging was immediately impressed with the quality of the texture and went down to the mancave to see if this would solve my problems. Lo and behold, I&rsquo;ve got a solid picture again and can avoid getting a new projector for a few more years. For ~$8, you&rsquo;re getting two very high quality cables that look nice, and there are a few extra trinkets in there to make you feel warm and fuzzy. Overall I am extremely pleased, and glad that I actually went with a higher quality cable to solve my signal loss problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely well made product! Don&rsquo;t think twice about ordering this product&hellip;I have have about 20 of them and they look/work great! During my home&rsquo;s construction, they were able to withstand many contractors working around them; the dust caps protected them until we were done with our construction so I am thrilled with this product!</p>
