OxyLED - Lights You Can Live By
Introducing a light that sets the level on after dark illumination. When it comes to nightlights, OxyLED N08 really is best in class. This pack of 3 motion sensor lamps runs on 3 x AAA batteries and uses highly efficient LED bulbs with 2 functions: constant and auto (activates when movement is detected within 15m and shuts off when no motion has been detected for seconds). The LEDs emit a soft, steady daylight white that is bright enough for early risers to move easily about the house without disturbing anyone who is still sleeping. Minimal power consumption and flat, rounded design mean the N08 fails to add even pennies to your energy bills, does not get hot, and is safe for use around children, pets, and errant sleep walkers.</p>

<p>Flexible Installation
The N08 is a great light for kids who are not so great with night time, but also knows that after dark lighting is not just for the nursery anymore. With 3 mount systems (hook, magnetic and adhesive strips) the lamps can be mounted anywhere in your house, and easily repositioned if needs be. While the lights continue to work well in low temperatures, making them a perfect garage, trailer, or basement installation.</p>

<p>Package Content:
- 3 X OxyLED N08 motion light
- 3 X 3M tape base
- 3 X Magnetic base
-User manual

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="flexible-useful-and-powerful-backed-up-with-great-customer-service-and-support">Flexible, useful and powerful, backed up with great customer service and support.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the 3 pack. These are great little lights. I put them inside closets so as soon as I stick my hand in they trigger, lighting up the interior of the closet. They&rsquo;re perfect for this, they put out quite a bit of light, and given they use three AAA batteries, I shouldn&rsquo;t have to change batteries very often.I like that you can mount using the included double sided tape, magnet, or screw in mount options. Lots of flexibility, and I will definitely be ordering more.One of the three lights did not work when I got the order. I wrote to them late one night, and by the time I got up the next morning there was an email in my inbox apologizing and offering to send me a replacement at the address I originally had the order sent to. That&rsquo;s fantastic and fast customer service that was a pleasure to come into contact with. I have all three working lights, and will definitely be ordering more of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-awesome-set-of-lights">Pretty awesome set of lights</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Batteries last forever, nice detection range. I installed one each over my front and back door. They provide plenty of light to see and use my keys. I installed them in November 2015 and they are still going strong on the first set of batteries two months later, even in below freezing temperatures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="then-the-light-came-on">Then the light came on</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Because my brother has these all over his house and garage i was impressed by these little things. They put out plenty of light and are tough and attractive. I mounted one on the hallway ceiling with the sticky tape just to see how it would work in this area. And it did perform well. I was surprised that after 2 days it fell off the 8&rsquo; ceiling. I thought the little guy was damaged after it hit the hardwood floor but the fall didn&rsquo;t hurt it in anyway. I then got a couple of small screws and installed it that way. I am so pleased. Now, I don&rsquo;t have to install an other light fixture or run wire, screw holes or install switches. I ordered 6 of these and have put them in my gun safe, rolling tool box, different areas of the garage and one over my front porch in case i forget to turn on the porch lamp. I believe that my power bill has gone down somewhat and saved so much time, effort and money by not running new wire. The magnets that were supplied were like a bonus. They are strong, a great idea for these lamps. I am ordering more and looking at their other products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-buy-bright-led-light-motion-activated">A Great buy, bright LED light motion activated</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A Great buy, bright LED light motion activated&hellip;love that it comes with 2 ways to hang it, magnetic or adhesive. I have it on a metal door, the light activates as I come up the stairs to the landing and stays on till I climb the second set of stairs. Saves me from turning on and off 2 sets of lights.Unfortunately it activates as I pass the upper stair area&hellip;am still seeing if there is some way to avoid that, otherwise I will see how long the 3 AAAbatteries last. I think this is still a great buy and useful, especially with the power outtages with the winter storm season. I tested all 3 with my orderand they all function.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave on to my mom, she&rsquo;s in a nursing home and it works great to give her some light at night when she needs to get up. Also I placed two of these along the floor boards and it helps us to avoid tripping over our black cat at night. I wish I could set how long these are on once the detect motion, but they are a great product at a reasonable price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-theses-lights">Love theses lights</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>just a warning</em></strong>The third time i bought these lights, one pack (3 lights) did not work. I had new batteries so i knew that wasn&rsquo;t the problem. I looked at one that was working &amp; one that was not working and noticed that the battery connection, metal piece that the battery touches, was different. The battery was not making the connection so i took a thin tool and pulled out the metal connection. Then I inserted the battery and it worked.3rd time buying these lights&hellip;they are fantastic! With a motion sensor that automatically turns on and off I have light where I need it the most, in my closets. Con: was the price went up from the 1st time I purchased $16.99 and the 3rd time $22.99.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sensor-worked-well-on-my-second-order-of-this-product">Sensor worked well on my second order of this product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Of the three I purchased one was DOA, other was lot able to detect motion as well as the 3rd one which did work perfectly. I place the two working ones in the same spot and they had a lot of difference in the latency form one light to the other was 3 seconds b4 it turned on. Company was easy to work with and stood behind their product.Update: I purchased the set of three again and this time the are working as I had hope for. Now the test of time. More after a few weeks of using them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-bright">Really bright!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so bright I could use them as a flashlight, instead of nightlight in my bathroom. I like that they don&rsquo;t come on during the day or when other lights are on. Also, I like that they can be mounted and easily removed to change the batteries. Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with them. Would have given 5 stars, but battery life isn&rsquo;t all that great, even with premium lithium batteries. I imagine that&rsquo;s the flip side of having such a bright light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for 2weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfit-for-closets-cabinets-ect">Perfit for closets cabinets, ect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very bright and motion sensor works well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="probably-wont-t-last-one-lasted-3-months">Probably wont&rsquo;t last, one lasted 3 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty good, but one has failed. Bright light, good motion sensors, low price (if they all don&rsquo;t fail).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They use the batteries way to fast</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beautiful-but-faulty-batteries-get-rid-of-less-than-3">Beautiful but faulty batteries get rid of less than 3 &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beautiful but faulty batteries get rid of less than 3 weeks old and the lighting and lighting is not as bad as I&rsquo;ve done</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="led">Led</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Motion is always on point</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-lights-great-buy">good lights, great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great lights that I have in different places of the home and the sensor works great. The light is nice and bright and it&rsquo;s a great value. Nothing much else to say, great buy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-2">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Battery consumption is too obvious</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-convenient-and-effective-lights">Very convenient and effective lights</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two sets of these (6 total lights) for use in my pantry, kitchen entryway from my garage, along my stairs, and in my bathrooms. They are so bright and work very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-consistent">Not consistent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work most of the time but not always. Seems like the motion sensor piece may be defective.</p>
