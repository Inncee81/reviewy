<h5 id="black-and-chrome-not-a-gimmick-but-an-entirely-different-film-in-its-own-right">Black and Chrome&hellip; not a gimmick, but an entirely different film in its own right.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the Black &amp; Chrome version only. If you&rsquo;ve already sampled clips via YouTube let it be known that shot by shot comparisons are one thing, witnessing the entire film in stark black and white is another. Honestly the first time I watched the B&amp;C (Black &amp; Chrome) edition I thought it looked cool but I decided I liked the color version better since I knew it was originally shot to be in color and felt I was looking at an afterthought idea. I was also analyzing shot composition constantly and not immersing myself into the film itself. A few days later I decided to watch some of the B&amp;C version again, then I put in the color disc in to compare and suddenly I realized I actually like the B&amp;C version better. Yes, even the director admitted some shots don&rsquo;t translate very well in black and white (especially the dark scenes at night) but what you gain with black and white is a complete different feel overall. When I went back to the color version it felt more like a typical Hollywood blockbuster action film&hellip; when you watch the B&amp;C version you feel like you&rsquo;re being drawn into another world&hellip; bleak, gritty and steampunk apocalyptic. Sounds strange when we&rsquo;re talking about the same film with the same visuals, but believe me there is a perceptive difference. I&rsquo;m one of the suckers who bought the initial blu ray release when the first version was released, but fortunately the B&amp;C edition is fairly priced and I have no regrets owning it in addition to the original. The Black and Chrome edition is the version I&rsquo;ll watch more often. What may seem like a gimmick is actually a masterful idea. On a final note if you think they simply de-saturated the picture that&rsquo;s not the case. Each shot was enhanced / reformatted with a true black and white representation.</p>

<h5 id="brilliant-film-bad-blu-ray-wait-for-the-dec-2016-edition">Brilliant Film, Bad Blu-Ray, Wait For The Dec 2016 Edition</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:The Fury Road Black &amp; Chrome edition will be released as part of two sets in the US (in addition to the German release) this December. The first, an anthology called Mad Max The High Octane Collection (ASIN B01LTHM35M ) and the second, Mad Max Two Film Collection (ASIN B01LTHM352 ) which contains the first wave Mad Max: Fury Road Blu-ray version (in color) as well as the Black &amp; Chrome Edition (the black and white version most of us have been waiting for). As of now, they are reporting one Blu-ray for both films together and one DVD for both films together with no official word as to whether the isolated score (which is how you get the silent version) will be present on the color version, the Black &amp; Chrome version, or both, or (dread) neither and there is also no word confirming that the Black &amp; Chrome has the dialogue/theatrical audio option. I will update when these issues have been addressed.Original Review:To repeat, this 3 star review is a review of the Blu-ray, not the film, which is brilliant in case you haven&rsquo;t seen it.The distributor of this film has decided to hold back two separate versions of Fury Road, promised by director Miller, to be included here and confirmed by him as having been completed in time for this release, because they want more of our money. The plan is to hold back these versions, including the increasingly popular Black and White version, which is spectacular, for inclusion on a later release of this film. The second or third edition of this film will be one of Warner&rsquo;s ever expanding line-up of complete releases that only come out after the company has made endless money on an initial, pathetic offering with missing features and exclusions galore.This film is glorious, make no mistake, but this release is shameful. If you love Fury Road and can&rsquo;t wait to see it again, I don&rsquo;t blame you for having to run out and buy it, but, if you can make yourself wait for it, I advise that you do so. Within a year they&rsquo;ll be talking about the full release (that this should have been) and you&rsquo;ll be able to purchase Fury Road with all the special features and alternate versions you were meant to have on this incomplete edition, though it is possible they&rsquo;ll hold that version until closer to the release of the first sequel to this reboot series. (Basically, think of this as another X-Men Days Of Future Past, if that had been a good movie with a second version actually worth seeing, and the alternate versions are like the Rogue Cut, if the Rogue Cut hadn&rsquo;t been a joke and you&rsquo;ll get the picture on this double dipping scheme they&rsquo;ve got going over at Warner.)Good luck in making your choice. I&rsquo;ve decided to wait for the full release and, if there is any delay, grab a cheap copy of this in a Walmart bargain bin.</p>

<h5 id="great-movie-but-pass-on-the-4k-uhd-bd-3d-and-black-chrome-review">Great movie.. but pass on the 4K (UHD, BD, 3D and Black &amp; Chrome review)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off by saying I love the movie &ndash; it&rsquo;s a fun movie with a lot of great cinematography and over-the-top action scenes.This review focuses more on the different versions of the film:Having bought the Blu-Ray, Black &amp; Chrome set &amp; Blu-Ray 3D previously, I wanted to see what the 4K experience was like.Blu-Ray: Looks great. Sounds great. Overall very good experience.Black &amp; Chrome set: Definitely recommended; includes both the original blu-ray and a black &amp; white version which is a totally different experience. Not the same as just lowering the color on your TV.. this one really &ldquo;shines&rdquo; (no pun intended). Even after watching the normal version several times, this felt like a totally new movie.3D: Again, a totally unique experience that was a lot of fun. Good 3D popout and depth.. Alongside the Black and Chrome version, this is tied for my favorite version of the film. Also includes the 2D Blu-Ray.4K: And here&rsquo;s where I was disappointed. I have a high-end UHD Player (Oppo 203), high-end 4K OLED (LG 65c6p) and was excited for it. Unfortunately.. it didn&rsquo;t deliver. In fact, parts even look worse.The film is slightly re-colored using the HDR toning (apparently this was done from the original master rather than the same as the previous releases). Beyond that, CGI becomes very noticeable (stuff that looked real in all the other versions looked very fake in this one; the fire, backgrounds and more all looked pretty bad and stood out). The film is also very noisy; apparently this was part of the original effect, but the 4K significantly enhances it and it doesn&rsquo;t look good. Lastly, the overall increase in sharpness isn&rsquo;t as significant as you would like. I will say that the first few chapters were significantly worse than the later chapters and I don&rsquo;t know why.Of all the versions I&rsquo;ve watched, the 4K was the least impressive. I went in with mixed expections on what to expect (some reviews are very positive, others very poor) and unfortunately wasn&rsquo;t impressed.</p>
