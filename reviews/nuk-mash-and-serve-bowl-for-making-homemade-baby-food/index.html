<h5 id="perfect-for-baby-food-at-all-stages">Perfect for baby food at all stages</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this initially for making baby food while traveling/on-the-go but as soon as it arrived, we used it right away. I make our baby food at home using the steam/hand blend/freeze method but this allows us to make baby food right there on the spot and it&rsquo;s nice and fresh. Sure one can argue (poorly at that) that a fork and bowl could yield the same results, but dump your fresh food right in, give the small pulverzier a push and about 2 spins later, you have fresh baby food. My little one is six months and she loves eating: bananas, avocado, peaches, nectarines, and melons. For the banana and avocado, mix it with a little breastmilk or formula to get it to the right runny consistency. The thing I like about this bowl for nectarines and peaches, those fruits have a tendency to be stringy and I&rsquo;m afraid it will choke my little one. This device cuts up the string without making the mush too runny and leaving it a thick consistency (something a fork and bowl will take you quite a while to do). I often defrost a frozen cube of blended fruit right in the bowl and add half a fresh banana and mush them all together. I like that you can feed your baby right out of the bowl and clean up is a breeze. So glad I bought this thing and I can&rsquo;t see us living without it.Update (11/15/13): My little one is now ten months old. This bowl masher has taken up permanent residency in our diaper bag. She now eats the same table food we eat. We just cut up smaller chunks of veggies and take more veggies/meat/carb in the bowl and mash that up then mix up the cut up foot with the mashed food to create a chunky stew-like consistency. She only has two bottom teeth and two top teeth poking out so she can&rsquo;t quite chew some of the harder cuts of meat, so this thing comes in handy when the meats aren&rsquo;t toddler friendly. It has saved us in packing baby food and BUYING baby food alone. We love this thing!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-goes-everywhere-with-us-now-highly-recommend">It goes everywhere with us now - highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the perfect item to mash up food to give to our 11 month old. We have tried a few other products that didn&rsquo;t come close to this in terms of ease of use, effectiveness, and ease of cleaning. Some things I like about this product:- The pieces are dishwasher safe which makes clean up easy.- The bowl has a rubber bottom which makes it slip resistant.- There are grooves in the bowl the provide a nice amount friction for mashing up foods.- It is sturdy and durable (now is on to the third different child using this).- It&rsquo;s a one &ldquo;pot&rdquo; meal - mash it up and serve right from it.We have used this for about a month with all kinds of foods: pasta, meats, beans, fruits, veggies, etc. For the cost, I cannot recommend picking up this product enough - you will not be disappointed. It more than easily pays for itself in money saved from buying less jars of baby food!UPDATE:- over 6 months later and we have pretty much stopped using this product as our son is old enough (and has enough teeth) to not need most foods mashed up. Although, he does enjoy potatoes and other veggies mashed up still&hellip;so it still gets some occasional use.This has held up through the entire time we used it and it will be ready to go for our next child! I stand by my original review of this product - it was a HUGE help for feeding our son all sorts of table food for many months.Update #2 - 12/16/14- baby #2 has officially started solid foods a few weeks ago and we took this right out of the attic. Since our first, we had let someone else borrow this and it still is in perfect condition! Bananas and sweet potatoes are being mashed to perfection already. We look forward to being able use this the entire time with this baby.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="we-love-this-bowl">We LOVE this bowl!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We used this early on for simple puree/mash type foods, banana, avocado, sweet potato, etc. What I didn&rsquo;t expect was to still be using it for this long.We&rsquo;re just now hitting the 10 month mark and still using it. We&rsquo;re at that awkward stage where he&rsquo;s past the purées but not really good at getting the finger foods in his mouth and gags on the larger chunks a lot.It&rsquo;s so easy to mash up what we are eating for dinner for him into small rice-ish size pieces with this bowl. And it&rsquo;s fast! This homemade chicken noodle soup took maybe 20 seconds. Now he mostly eats everything we eat. There&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t try to mash in this bowl! What a money and time saver!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="does-the-trick-but-it-s-super-necessary-it-s-handy-to-have-though">Does the trick, but it&rsquo;s super necessary! It&rsquo;s handy to have though</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really use this a lot, but when I have used it, it does the trick. It&rsquo;s great for bananas, blueberries and stuff that you don&rsquo;t really need a food processor for, but as the baby gets older, you can eventually just break stuff into small pieces and don&rsquo;t need to mash it. However, I do like to use it just as bowl for him in general because the handle is nice!!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="really-like-this-even-more-than-i-expected">Really like this - even more than I expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I wish I had purchased this MUCH earlier. I bought this on kind of a whim, not really sure I would go to the trouble of getting it out or wanting to wash it. I didn&rsquo;t think I would use that often, but it was so handy to help baby experiment with the food we are eating. He&rsquo;s starting to be old enough to be eating table food - If I had it to do over again, I would have bought it 3 months earlier AND would have gotten two! It cleans well, is a good size, and handy he can just eat right out of the bowl when done squishing it up.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-mashes-a-whole-banana-without-chunks-so-easily-within-10-seconds">It mashes a whole banana without chunks so easily within 10 seconds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. This thing works! I&rsquo;ve been trying to use a regular bowl and a spoon to mash the banana for my baby, and it was frustrating since banana kept slipping away from the spoon, and it just wasn&rsquo;t smashed properly. This mash bowl and a masher set makes my life easier. It mashes a whole banana without chunks so easily within 10 seconds. I regret not buying this earlier. What a genius product!READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the best food related baby product I&rsquo;ve purchased.It is easy to take with you when you are out to mash up a banana or something else in the in this phase of introducing different foods to the baby. It is used together with baby bib, is a perfect combination. Let the baby&rsquo;s clothes to keep clean, dry,Very high quality (slightly thick and warm) and highly recommended!
