<h5 id="nice-unit-and-possibly-as-good-as-it-gets-for-the-money">Nice unit and possibly as good as it gets for the money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This sounds great and has all the latest features including HDMI2.0.Pros:Sound quality is excellent from all sources.Connectivity is solid. I’m not using an Ethernet cable and I’m streaming from an Iphone6, using Airplay, Bluetooth, and Casting. Casting Pandora is cool but sometimes when a commercial is encountered the Pandora App hangs and needs a restart.Watching action movies is awesome. Plenty of power for a large room. I’m using the surround for the front height speakers.HDMI is still working after 2 weeks. Keeping my fingers crossed with this. It appears to be a common problem with many A/V receivers.SongPal app does the job although not as energy efficient as the Remote App for Itunes. I prefer using the Synology app that came with the NAS. It has more features.HDMI passes HD with no issues. I don’t have 4K.GUI is nice.Setup was a breeze. Connected to Linksys 750 router without issue. Update went smooth.Cons:Airplay volume control sometimes gets lost and loses control but after a while it comes back. Weird.No AM tuner? The spec shows it does. And the 850 has it. Did they remove it?No phono input, but I knew this going in.The unit was shutting off while playing mp3s via Airplay wireless from a laptop after about 1 hour. It turns out there is a setting to auto power down when no activity is detected (the default). Apparently it doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s playing the mp3s. Disabling this setting took care of this. It would be nice to have it auto power down when there really is no activity. Not a big deal.Pretty cheap feeling (and cheap looking) buttons for this price range. My opinion. I can barely see them.The display is from the 1970&rsquo;s. Sony has a nice display on their audio DACs for album art. Why not use that for their receivers? That would eliminate the cheap buttons and the need for a TV for setup and other settings.The features tout multi-room capability. I’m not sure what they are referring to. Without a manual I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever figure it out. No hard copy user manual and the online documentation was just a product brief at the time of purchase.No switched AC receptacle on the rear. It would have been nice to power my subwoofer. My cheap Denon from 30 years ago had this. It seems you need to spend $900 to get this these days.Remote is good, but why do the designers bury the sleep timer in nested menus. This should be a top level button that you can easily find when you’re ready to sleep. By the time I find it I’m wide awake again.HDMI pass–though is a must. You may not want to have the A/V on while watching the news. It works nicely, but apparently the HDMI circuitry needs to be powered up <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. This is obvious by how warm the unit is while in standby mode. This is a feature that is not enabled by default. Standby current does not appear to be spec&rsquo;ed with HDMI Pass-Through enabled. My guess is many of the people whose HDMI outputs go dead after a while may be using this feature.When will A/V manufacturers start making these things smaller? It’s not the 80’s anymore where you felt you were getting more with a big box. This is 13 inches deep, so it will fit on an 11 inch shelf with the feet hanging half off, and that’s fine. The higher end units are 15-16 inches deep. Who has room for that?Another complaint I have with all AV receivers is that Airplay does not work with video. How can you have an Audio Video product that doesn’t handle video, other than HDMI pass-through. It’s annoying that I still have to use my ATV to send video from my iphone to the TV.Also, Pandora and Tunein (and the potential to add other streaming Apps) should be built into the unit so that you don’t need to rely on your Iphone to stream or cast it. Every $99 gadget and DVD player out there has this capability.Updated 6/16/15Deleted comment about speaker switch not working correctly. It was operator error. You need to disable the front high speakers first in the setup if you plan on using them for another room.Added comment about auto power down while playing mp3s.Updated 6/23/15Deleted comment about wifi dropping when using a NAS. This appears to happen when using the Songpal App while the Synology App is running in the background. I don’t blame it for getting confused. Added comment about Pandora and Tunein should be built into the unit. You’re probably wondering why so many stars with all the negatives. Compared to reviews of other AV systems regarding wifi and HDMI reliability, connectivity and video pass-through with this Sony are very solid, sound is excellent, and the negatives appear to be common with all AV receivers. In my opinion most AV manufactures need to improve these products by miniaturizing, support Airplay video, update the display to at least the 90’s, and stop cheaping out on materials. Like no switched AC outlet, no Phono input (yes we’re still out there), no AM, only 2 optical inputs, cheesy buttons, and even the 75 ohm coax connector for the FM antenna was removed. Come on guys, it’s not like there isn’t enough room. :)Updated 11/11/15Still going strong. No issues at all. HDMI still working with pass-through enabled. As an experiment, it turns out the unit gets just as warm in standby mode with HDMI pass-through disabled. Oh well. Streaming audio via the Synology NAS is working flawlessly with the STRDN860 and an Airport Express to another amplifier simultaneously. I noticed the price sometimes drops to $448…..that’s a good buy!</p>

<h5 id="it-is-okay-at-best-but-i-expected-more-from-sony">It is okay at best, but I expected more from Sony!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sony XBR43X830C 43-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2015 Model)Sony BDPS7200 Dual Core 3D 4K Upscaling Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi (2014 Model)Let me start first with stating I am a loyal Sony customer - since I got my first job, I have been always pairing Sony AV receiver, Sony TV and Sony DVD player, later Blu-ray DVD player. At least for my second and third gen Entertainment center, I even Amazon purchasing record to prove this (first set was bought retail).So, actually I am biased, and it is quite possible that rating should be lower. Maybe I learn something along the way, and increase the rating later. In any case, my expectations for Sony entertainment equipment is 5-stars, nothing less.So, I got Sony STRDN860 AV receiver (did not need 1060 multi-room functionality), Sony XBR43x830c and Sony BDPS7200 blu-ray player (links are included). Here are pros and cons for the receiver:PROS:1) Sound is pretty good. Everything with sound works well, therefore 3 stars baseline.2) It passes HDMI video, it can upscale to 4K and that works wellCONS:1) Remote is horrible. It is only good for the AV receiver itself, but unlike previous remotes, it cannot pick up any functionalities for TV or Sony Blu-ray DVD player!2) Perhaps HDMI-CEC can help - one would think. I am not sure if the standard is at fault (why would I care, I am a consumer&amp;customer!), but it is not possible to press power button on the AV receiver remote and have TV power on together with the receiver! Also, it is not possible to power TV off when receiver is powered down. Same for blu-ray DVD player! Curiosuly enough, it is possible to turn on TV with the TV remote, and have receiver turn on, however this is useless, as one needs receiver remote much more. I have played with HDMI-CEC settings on all applainces - the possibilities are very limited (i.e. on the receiver CEC-HDMI can be only on or off). I have also went to HDMI organization web pages, and read about CEC / HDMI standard. For some reason, TV is behaving as a &ldquo;master&rdquo; device, and it is not possible to make receiver a master device. Very annoying.3) So, I am stuck with 3 remotes (except that blu-ray remote actually has a little button for TV, so it is possible to reduce this to two). This is very annoying, and there is no good information on how can Sony customer (a loyal one) get a one remote for 3 devices that are all from year 2015? Even more, why isn&rsquo;t this included? My previous AV receiver remote was able to control TV, receiver and blu-ray! Why would I have to research universal remotes - I have chosen all latest equipment, high-to-highest end, from Sony!4) uPnP/DLNA functionality - there are bugs. AV receiver is supposed to be able to play music from the uPnP enabled servers. However, this ONLY works if one browses through default uPnP folders (i.e. &ldquo;Music&rdquo;). If one is browsing through actual file/folder structure on the NAS server, the files cannot be played. embarassing, ESPECIALLY since Blu-ray DVD player does not have this problem. You may say - OK - it works on the Blu-ray player. However, I always test all the features, and expect them to work. It is not as if consumers are paying with fake dollars.5) Functionality lag - for some reason I do not understand as an engineer - when I turn on receiver, it takes about 4-5 seconds for the receiver to negotiate with the TV and pass the HDMI signal. I understand that there is HDMI security protocols to be negotiated, but really, on consumer expense???I think I am coming to CES 2016 again this year - I am going to visit Sony booth and talk more about my experience&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="it-s-perfect-for-what-i-needed">It&rsquo;s perfect for what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect for what I needed. I have setup sony home theatre using this AV receiver and it was super easy. I have connected Sony sub woofer, 2 Sony tower speakers, two bookshelfs and one center speaker thus making a 5.1 surround system and I am very happy with the results. Earlier I was planning to buy Sony soundbar HT-NT5 and additional wireless speakers but verified with Sony tech support that the sound of wired speakers will always be better than wireless ones. So I went for wired setup. This AV receiver makes it easy to connect wired speakers by supporting banana plugs input. So a normal speaker wire can be passed in to a banana plug and then banana plug can be inserted into AV receiver&rsquo;s banana plug sockets. Also the receiver supports Bluetooth connection so I can directly play songs from my mobile through my speaker system.</p>

<h5 id="great-unit-for-a-small-home-theater">Great Unit For a Small Home Theater.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This receiver is perfect for the small home theater in our home. The easy setup and the sound quality is superb. This was purchased to replace an existing Onyko unit I had, that was outdated and having issues. I liked that it had the option to configure the location of the surround speakers. The prior unit I had was a 5.1 configuration, so I was not wanting to have to run wires to add side speakers. The Sony STRDN860 allowed me to stick with the original speaker placement I had and ad the 2 new ones as additional front speakers at a lower level. I have owned many different receivers over the years and this one was well worth it.</p>

<h5 id="no-subwoofer-center-speakers-when-casting-is-by-design">No subwoofer / center speakers when casting is &ldquo;by design&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When casting / using multiroom functionality, not all of your speakers will work. Per Sony this is by design, and is not configurable. See Sony&rsquo;s knowledgebase article 75892 .Sony STRDN860 7.2 Channel Hi-Res WiFi Network AV Receiver (Black)</p>
