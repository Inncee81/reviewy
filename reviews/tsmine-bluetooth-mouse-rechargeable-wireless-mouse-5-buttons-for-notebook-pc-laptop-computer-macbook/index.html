<h5 id="very-smooth-and-light-weight">Very smooth and light weight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse is great. I have a tablet that I like to use a mouse with when I&rsquo;m working on it. I was using a mouse with a USB plug before this, but the tablet requires and adapter to use a regular size USB and I could not charge the tablet at the same time. This bluetooth mouse was super easy to pair to the tablet (Bluetooth settings, click connect on discover-able mouse). It is a nice size and fits easily in my purse with my tablet. It fits perfectly in my hand and doesn&rsquo;t require to use bettery and just charge with the cable that comes with. So it is very light weight which is very nice and the scroll wheel is very smooth and not loud. I am very satisfy and probably order another one for my desktop.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needing a back-up mouse and not wanting to pay Apple&rsquo;s outrageous price, I gave this a shot. Nice overall. Paired easily. Rolls smoothly. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is the plastic is so thin the optical and Bluetooth lights illuminate through the top of the mouse, which I find distracting. I&rsquo;m hoping after a while, I get used to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-give-up-on-it-if-you-have-a-macbook-it-works-for-me">Don&rsquo;t give up on it if you have a MACBOOK. It works for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it so far, i had it for a couple Weeks. Please don&rsquo;t give up if you have a macbook. I had to play with it, in order for it to work. you don&rsquo;t need a mouse pad if you have a regular office desk but i use mine on a glass table so i need it. Its really pretty and I&rsquo;m happy with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-mouse">Amazing mouse!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this mouse a lot. It has a good feel to it and it feels comfortable when you use it. It doesn&rsquo;t have the usb so it doesn&rsquo;t get lost easily. It&rsquo;s easy to move around and there isn&rsquo;t that much friction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This one came DOA as careless employee put in a far too large box with little protection allowing it to get banged around in shipping damaging the innards. Typical Amazon experience return and credit a snap turned right around ordered a replacement.This is my third one the other two are best thing since Motherhood and apple pie much better expensive Apple mouse that looks snazzier but more difficult to use as no track wheel rum finger along top and is not always sensitive enough. The all of sudden whips page too far. Also no need replace batteries one charge last a long time have not exhausted them yet between occasional charges. Blue light comes on whenUSB cable attached to charge and goes out when charged.</p>

<h5 id="wireless-or-bluetooth-read-carefully-and-buyer-beware-if-running-on-a-macbook">Wireless or Bluetooth? read carefully and BUYER BEWARE if running on a MacBook</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price &hellip; it works fine as a rose gold wireless mouse to match my computer &hellip; but what a waste of time to order 1 product and receive a different product. Spent <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour following instructions for pairing a bluetooth mouse before finally &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; it was actually wireless.LOL by the time the vendor responded to my pleas for help &hellip; I&rsquo;d already figured-out i had a wireless mouse instead of bluetooth. The usb thingie folds-up inside the mouse so it looked like a pushbutton that didn&rsquo;t work &hellip; especially since the instructions told me to push the &ldquo;connect&rdquo; button on my bluetooth mouse &hellip;&hellip; i kept trying to PUSH the button per the instructions b/f I randomly tried pulling it (I was ready to smash it at that point) and lo and behold &hellip; out popped the USB wireless thingie which had been cleverly disguised as a bluetooth &ldquo;connect&rdquo; button.I originally gave a 1-star review but the vendor responded to my issue and changed the mis-leading ad &hellip; so i up-graded this review.I thought I was buying a BLUETOOTH mouse and the INSTRUCTIONS I received in the package were for a BLUETOOTH mouse &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t really want a wireless mouse b/c if you have the new 2016 or later macbook &hellip; you know you just have that 1 mini-usb port &hellip; so to run this mouse you need to use an adapter &hellip; spaghetti wires &hellip; what I DIDN&rdquo;T want.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-rose-gold-and-super-lightweight-a-k-a-thin-plastic">Cute, rose gold and super lightweight (a.k.a thin plastic)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, this is exactly what I wanted. A rose gold bluetooth mouse to match my other rose gold accessories. That said, the price is also a good indicator of how well it is made in this case. I&rsquo;m giving it only 3 stars for the quality. In cuteness - which is more a girl thing I admit - it&rsquo;s closer to 4 stores for the rose gold. Be aware it seems to be very cheaply made - but has a pretty look to it. It&rsquo;s super light weight - and made of very light thin plastic. I have a habit of just tossing my mouse into my computer bag and not noticing if the computer sits on top of it or not. This mouse is so flimsy I worry that my 13 inch MacBook will accidentally break it. Still, if it lasts me a year - I might just get another one just like it when it&rsquo;s time to replace it. It works very well and I find myself using it more than the mouse I paid $50 for. I posted a picture of it sitting on top of a metallic pink iPad case if you want to get a feel for the color variation.***Update: I&rsquo;ve used it a couple weeks now - Just a heads up - it needs to be recharged every couple of days - which is okay with me now that I&rsquo;m aware of how frequently it&rsquo;s needed. I keep the little cord in my bag. The other thing I&rsquo;d share is that it has a habit of disconnecting itself a couple times a day - and you&rsquo;ll need to turn it off and on most of the time to re-establish the connection. Sometimes, I have to manually go back into my bluetooth settings and reconnect it there. I still like the mouse but the amount of time I spend reconnecting it has made me wonder if it&rsquo;s just a bluetooth issue or if a more expensive model would work better.</p>

<h5 id="rechargeable-mouse-works-well-with-tv-box-and-macbook">Rechargeable mouse, works well with TV box and macbook</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I lost my TV box controller, so I am not able to control my tv box, I checked the user manual, it said that I can use mouse to control it, so I thought it is better to get a wireless one so I can control the box from the sofa, so I found this one from amazon, I like this design, so I ordered it, it delivered very fast, I got it sooner than expected, I am able to control my TV box now and can enjoy watching movie and TV dramas without ads. Love it! I also use it with my macbook pro, works perfect too. Another function I would like to recommend is it is rechargeable mouse, don&rsquo;t need to change batteries too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="arrived-so-soon">Arrived so soon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like the wireless and rechargeable mouse!! I don&rsquo;t want to go out to buy batteries when I&rsquo;m busy working in front of my computer!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with the packaging and the product. Exactly what I expected! Very good product. I recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-last-a-day">Did not last a day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse did not work after the first day, which is ridiculous. I charged it and still nothing. It did not work, even though the light was on. It&rsquo;s crap.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-mouse-is-the-right-size">This mouse is the right size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You could put it in your front pants pocket and walk around with it all day, no problem, but it also doesn&rsquo;t feel like you are playing with a Barbie dream mouse when it comes time&hellip;</p>
