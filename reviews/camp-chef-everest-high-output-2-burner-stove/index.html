<p>They say big things come in small packages. The same holds true with the Camp Chef Everest Stove. The NEW Mountain Series Everest is the little stove that could. With two 20,000 BTU burners the Everest packs a serious amount of punch. Built in the same case as the Denali and Rainer Mountain Series stoves, the Everest is small, lightweight, and ready for any challenge thrown at it.</p>

<h5 id="great-function-large-cooking-area-high-btus-dependable-ignition">Great function, large cooking area, high BTUs, dependable ignition</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read many reviews and specs for quite a few different types of propane stoves, and purchased the Camp Chef Everest as a result. I was going to be making a one-time purchase of a brand new propane stove which would hopefully last me the rest of my camping lifetime, and I was willing to pay a bit more - yet not an exorbitant amount - for the right stove.I can sometimes have a large group to cook for, and having something large enough to use 2 full-size pots or pans simultaneously was important. This stove is wider (just under 24&rdquo;) than previous stoves I have used, yet it is pretty lightweight (12 lbs.) and is the same size depth-wise as other stoves - it sits just fine on the camp kitchen. I boil large pots of water for bathing or cooking, and a higher BTU was a feature I especially searched for. I am really happy with how quickly I can heat water now, though the higher BTUs, the more propane you will use. It is so great to percolate coffee and cooking time for almost everything is reduced. Normal amount of propane is used when cooking at lower temperatures.It would be cool if the burner knobs had some sort of reference point for low or medium, but you figure out what works for you quickly. I am a fan of self ignition, and the igniter button has always fired on the first strike. The button is located on the face of the stove, near the burner knobs, and I find that I must have a grip on the stove when pushing the igniter button because it tends to slide the stove back. The stove is a bit more stable during ignition on a non- slippery surface like a wooden picnic table. I would have liked to have the button located somehow on the surface of the stove that could be pushed directly downward. There are wind guards are on sides of the stove, a strong wire cooking rack which is as well built as my home oven racks, and the burners are recessed under the wire rack and are situated so that clean up is not a hassle at all. We mountain camp and wind can sometimes really be a problem, but I have never had a burner blow out.I wanted to hook the stove up to a propane tree and bought an expensive extension hose, but the hose fittings did not match my stove and I have not yet attempted to locate the proper adapter - I used the small propane bottles that you can purchase in a four-pack all this season, but normally I would just use the smaller bottles when I do not have a larger propane tank with me. The stove comes with the adapter for those smaller bottles. The stove has a metal latch for closing and transporting, and a wire handle which seems strong but is kind of uncomfortable. I like to keep my equipment nice, and will next purchase a good padded bag to transport and store this stove in. I have now used this stove over a 5-month camping season and I am really happy with the quality, features, and price.I have given the Camp Chef Everest Propane Stove 5 stars for the following reasons:Higher BTUs have really improved cooking experience, greatly reduces time for boiling waterExtra width provides adequate space for two full size pots/pans used simultaneouslyGood dial controlIgniter lights on first strike, every timeStrong cooking rackEasy to keep cleanLightweight, can transport and set up myselfFlame has good wind shelterI would have liked to have clear information regarding the correct extension hose and adapter to use</p>

<h5 id="nice-stove">Nice stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this stove.We use it in our Scout Troop. We are phasing out our Coleman® PerfectFlow InstaStart&trade; Two-Burner Propane Stove in favor of these.This stove does put out some heat (and does use more propane). Marked difference from our old stoves though. Downside is the Scouts have burned a few items as they learn to manage the heat. That&rsquo;s good though, because the modus operandi is traditionally - &ldquo;throw it on&hellip; cook it at high heat to reduce cooking time, and gnaw through the carbonized crust&rdquo;!Another BIG plus is that this stove has a REAL latch. The Coleman stoves have a plastic button-latch that, over time, does not hold the stove together when carrying. This resulted in stoves opening apart while being carried, and parts falling out. Unfortunately, the result of that appears to have been that the Scout crams the brass propane arm in - sometimes against the burners - which has ruined 2 Coleman stoves.Burner knobs feel more sturdy.Also, stove is slightly wider than the Coleman, which will help with the larger pots and frying pans. It seems shorter top-to-bottom as well, but not significantly so.Cost was more than the Colemans (and many others we researched), but the quality seems to be there.I rated this a 4 since our first two stoves came with manufacturer damage (not shipping damage). One lid was so bent that we couldn&rsquo;t open the stove. The other had a dent, but in a non-critical place. We returned the first (no hassles). The second we kept since the dent was cosmetic. replacement stove was in perfect condition.We&rsquo;ll be replacing more stoves as the Colemans break, and we plan to order more of these Camp Chef stoves.Hope that helps&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="performs-well-could-use-some-improvement-in-valve-control">Performs well, could use some improvement in valve control.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked flawlessly during several excursions. Kicks up a powerful flame, though I wish there was a gas valve lockout on each knob. Probably fairly easy to leave open without realizing it. Something with a detent would work. It would be pretty easy to implement, just like a residential stove.</p>

<h5 id="dinner-at-lightning-speeds">Dinner at lightning speeds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is amazing. It boils a big pot of water before you have time to open the box of pasta. My only complaint is that sometimes it cooks things so fast that you can&rsquo;t keep up with it. Dinner is ready before I can make the salad or set the table!</p>

<h5 id="this-is-an-excellent-camping-stove">This is an excellent camping stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent camping stove. It can get very hot, which is especially a nice experience compared to our previous stove. Starts easily and on first attempt. Folds compactly to take up only a small space.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-burners-are-excellent-and-put-out-tons-of-heat">The burners are excellent and put out tons of heat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The burners are excellent and put out tons of heat. I&rsquo;d give it 5 stars if it wasn&rsquo;t so fragile. One of the corners was damaged during shipping. It was dented and the paint is flaking off. Still way better than what Coleman puts out nowadays.</p>

<h5 id="cooking-like-a-champ">Cooking like a champ</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>AWESOME camp stove. I bought the Camp Chef 5ft Bulk Hose as well. This thing gets hotter and cooks better than my residential stove. Get really hot and temperature control is really nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camp-stove">Great camp stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camp stove was perfect for our family. It&rsquo;s light weight, easy to use and fit a pan and a pot easily. We have decided we would like to get a stand for it, but it&rsquo;s a great stove.</p>

<p>Works great, don&rsquo;t care to much for the plastic latch. Could present a problem later down the road.</p>

<p>My second one. First cane and was bended from factory (can&rsquo;t stay stable on flat table). On second one piezo lighter and connection tube for gas tank stop working in 3 months.</p>

<p>I have only had it out for a couple of outings, but it really throws off the heat.</p>
