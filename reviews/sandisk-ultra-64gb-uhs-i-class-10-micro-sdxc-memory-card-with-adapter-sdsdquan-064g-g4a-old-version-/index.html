<h5 id="warning-potentially-counterfeit-units">Warning: Potentially Counterfeit Units</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this card on Monday and it arrived Wednesday, 9/30/15. I bought it from Amazon, it said &ldquo;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s the #1 best seller in microSD cards. The packaging seemed proper, but when I opened up the packaging and inspected the card, it looks obviously counterfeit. The detail in the printing is abysmal; while you would expect a 3 color screen printing process with sharp details and lines from the product photo, the item I received looked as though it had been labeled with a halftone CMYK printing process, which would make little sense if these were genuinely produced by SanDisk at a large volume. Even the packaging has higher resolution halftone printing with sharper details. There is also no &ldquo;raised&rdquo; or &ldquo;indented&rdquo; features on the back, which some people have pointed to as an indicator of a counterfeit. Attached are photos of the item I received next to a genuine Transcend unit, which has sharp lines and detail expected from a screen printing type process, taken from an iPhone 6 and from a digital microscope. If SanDisk could chime in and address this issue that would be good; are these wonky looking cards legit? Or, given that Amazon.com is an authorized reseller, is there a serious supply chain issue going on here?</p>

<p>Received the product as expected. No surprises and the card worked without any issues. Using in a Samsung Galaxy S5 Active. Transferred 30G of data, music, and pictures pretty fast. Very happy with the product and price.</p>

<h5 id="be-warned-possible-counterfit">BE WARNED!!! POSSIBLE COUNTERFIT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased a SanDisk 32gb ULTRA card and was running into issues with it mounting or working, websites were telling me there was a drive or flash error. I spent an entire night that I should have been working trying to fix this card, using multiple card readers, trying to save via my phone, etc etc. Nothing was working, transfers would cancel out halfway through, EVERY TIME. So then I started looking into it more&hellip;turns out it was a COUNTERFIT. The print job on the card was iffy, but the main giveaway is there is no raised box on the back of the card. Look at every one of your SANDISK cards, if they are real they have a raised box on the rear. THIS one did not&hellip;I should have known the price was too good</p>

<p>Dismal memory card fail right out of the blister pack, put in the adapter pc flickers recognize the card try to transfer some videos after 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> gig error message,card disappears from pc. Everything shows OK on pc after you try to use the card goes bananas.Formatted at different flavors not avail ,finally format successful same problem again. See pics.Disappointing going back!!!</p>

<h5 id="awesome-card-but-don-t-try-to-watch-video-stored-on-it">Awesome Card; but Don&rsquo;t Try to Watch Video Stored on it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I intend to use this with this product (<a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PUY8NAU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2">http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PUY8NAU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2</a>), theHyperDrive microSD Adapter for MacBook Pro 15&rdquo; Retina. Everything fits and works as you would think; but its very difficult to stream video from this card on the internal MBP display; and I&rsquo;ve got the top of the line 15&rdquo; MPB for my model year. Both video and audio played from this card stuttered and stopped. Nothing that I did made a difference with the performance, and this should have been a card that I should have been able to do this from. I&rsquo;d buy this kind of card again. Its a decent card, but I&rsquo;ve had to rethink my storage strategy for my MBP. I had planned on putting pictures, iTunes media and documents on this thing. Since OneDrive for Mac won&rsquo;t sync to an SD card and since streaming video (my primary iTunes content) correctly from this card, I&rsquo;ve had to stick with just pictures&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="feeling-a-bit-short-changed">Feeling a bit short changed?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I realize that the definition of a gigabyte has been rewritten by storage manufacturers a long time ago, but SanDisk takes it to yet another level. Whether formatted as NTFS or FAT32, this so called 32GB card actually only has 28.7 GB of space available. That&rsquo;s about 1 GB less than what some other cards deliver (29.7 GB). Is this the new industry standard? Do Samsung, PNY, and Transcend do the same thing these days?I use these cards in security cameras. 1 extra GB translates to 2 additional hours of video.As far as speeds, no complaints there. This 32 GB card tested at 47 MB/s read and 21 MB/s write speed on my PC.UPDATE Aug 12, 2015: Just ordered and received another one of these cars. Surprisingly, this new one writes almost as fast as it reads: 47 MB/s read and 42 MB/s write. That&rsquo;s twice as fast as the ones I bought a few months ago.</p>

<h5 id="all-burnt-up">All Burnt Up!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WTF!?!?!? I received the Micro I planned to use with my Sunco Mini Camera today. I inserted it in my computer to format and it almost instantly started burning- literally burning!!! When I went to remove it, it burned my thumb and was slightly melted. I am more than confident this cannot possibly be normal!! Based on this, I don&rsquo;t think I can recommend or even slightly suggest anyone buy this.</p>

<p>i received a counterfit camera card.. just like over a thousand people who ordered a Sandisk memory card i too got what was marked as a 32gb microSD card.. what i got was a card that holds only 16gb and it stopped working as soon as i tried to remove a days worth of photos&hellip; thats it, your fake product cost me a whole day of photos that i&rsquo;ll never be able to shoot again.. the card is unresponsive and unreadable&hellip; this card has no indent in the back and the print job doesnt match any of my functioning Sandisk cards (which i will never replace with Sandisk brand again)i actually expected to see that i had ordered from a small Chinese retailer who i&rsquo;d expect to be ripping people off with FAKES (intentionally, none of the over 1100 people who reported fakes here for one minute think this is a mistake on your part Sandisk,, we know it&rsquo;s GREED). but no this actually is being sold directly by the manufacturer&hellip; DISGRACEFUL&hellip; the company that pioneered memory card technology has sunk so low that they sell sub-grade garbage and label it as a premium item&hellip; yesterday i requested a replacement item, but after reading all these comments today i know that they are going to send me another FAKE that will likely let me down and loose all my photo and video work AGAIN..SanDisk&hellip; you should be ashamed to sell this garbage as a top product.</p>
