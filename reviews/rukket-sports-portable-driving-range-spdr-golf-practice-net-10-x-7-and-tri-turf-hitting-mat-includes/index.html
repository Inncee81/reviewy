<h5 id="great-golf-net">Great golf net!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great net! It breaks down easy and stores away with the net still on the frame. I bought it for my 7 yr old daughter to use in the garage and practice when the weather was not good. I put both side nets on the right hand side in case of a miss to the right and works fine. Built to last for a long time. Products made in the USA and signed up for the Rukket company ambassador club. Extremely satisfied.</p>

<h5 id="a-good-investment-in-your-game-fun-to-use-definitely-helps-improve-your-swing">A good investment in your game, fun to use, definitely helps improve your swing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With very little time to get to the range, and with a desire for some exercise and refining my swing, I ordered this as an investment. I&rsquo;d read many good reviews about this net, I researched other options, and chose this one.It arrived quickly, well packaged, and the instructions were good. Viewing the setup video on YouTube helped.Nice, large, sturdy storage bag.Takes about 4-5 minutes to set up, from opening the bag to putting the last stake in the side nets (it doesn&rsquo;t come with tent stakes but I find they give peace of mind in securing the side netting down. Got 4 aluminum stakes at Cabela&rsquo;s.)Very well made netting. The frame is easy to set up, gets much easier with the learned routine of putting it up and down.It&rsquo;s broad enough to not worry about mishits but if you are hitting your wedges or short irons you don&rsquo;t want to be hitting from too far away because I&rsquo;ve had a couple go over the net.I used mine outdoors in the back yard, not on a firm surface or indoors, so the balls didn&rsquo;t return to me, they just quietly (almost silently) hit the net and dropped down. You can hit any golf balls you want, as hard as you want, with any club you want, and never worry that the frame will tip over.It&rsquo;s very easy to take down and store. I&rsquo;ve used it probably 30 times already.Pros: Very well made, not flimsy.Easy to set up and take down with one person. It&rsquo;s not exactly light, but it&rsquo;s definitely manageable.Convenient to have an instant hitting set up in your back yard for when you&rsquo;d like to hit for an hour but don&rsquo;t have time to go the the range or (better yet) play.Excellent customer communication and service from the Rukket Sports people. I dealt with them by phone, email - very helpful.You get what you pay for - it&rsquo;s not the cheapest but not the most expensive net, either. It works beautifully, it seems built to last.Cons- Wish it came with side stakes to hold down the side nets. It&rsquo;s not bad without the side stakes but there can be a gap of a few inches and I don&rsquo;t ever want a stray mishit to fly through and cause damage. This really isn&rsquo;t a con, it&rsquo;s just a wish list item for improvement.It comes with a 3-grass artificial turf mat. It&rsquo;s nice but I bought a 5&rsquo; x 5&rsquo; hitting mat instead as it suited my needs better. The grass on the supplied mat is very realistic, it&rsquo;s just too small to be practical as the mat is a couple of inches or less above your feet, and it slides around a bit. However, if you don&rsquo;t want a separate large mat, the supplied one is helpful but not ideal.No, using this net isn&rsquo;t as satisfying or game improving as going to the range and being able to watch the ball flight but it&rsquo;s a definite way to improve your swing mechanics, rhythm, and sense of being in better golf shape. I&rsquo;m very satisfied with the quality of the net, very pleased with its performance, very pleased with the ease of setting it up and taking it down, and I would purchase this again. No buyer&rsquo;s remorse here.It&rsquo;s a well made product that does what it sets out to do.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-very-good">So far, very good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was hesitant to spend this kind of $ considering how many buckets it would have bought at the range, but after only using it a week I&rsquo;m glad I did. The driving range is obviously superior as you can see the flight of the ball, but the convenience of having it so accessible is great and leads to more practice. Even though you can&rsquo;t see the flight path, the feedback from a good and a bad ball strike is instantaneous which leads to more consistent hits. I first set it up on a grass area, but I quickly got tired of having to fetch the balls. It&rsquo;s now set up on a concrete patio and the ball usually returns, except for an occasional hang up in the net. By this I don&rsquo;t mean stuck in a hole in the net, but caught up in excess netting. As i said, I&rsquo;ve only been using it for a week, and there has been no penetration of the netting, even with the driver. I will do follow-up to my review if there are any future problems with durability. The SPDR is well engineered and of quality construction and I highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="purchased-a-rukket-sports-spdr-net-and-loving-it">Purchased a Rukket Sports SPDR net and loving it !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased a Rukket Sports SPDR net and loving it !! Considered a Net Return but the cost was 4x. In the end this net works the same for me as I see in the more expensive competitors big dollar version videos on youtube. This net works absolutely perfect and any other choice would have been a mistake !! I love the quick folding portability even though I will seldom take advantage of it. I am using this with a SkyTrak launch Monitor and it is a wow! good setup. I truly believe I would have felt ill having spent 4x the cost of this net and then saw one somewhere else later if I had bought the 4x more expensive competitor version mentioned above.Just as a further comment, mine came with the bigger longer add on side wings only pictured in maybe one of the pictures in their advertising and that was something I questioned until it arrived. They need to make this clearer !! You can use it with our with out them too. I am terrible and likely don&rsquo;t need them in a net 10 feet wide.Doug&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-useful-super-small-minor-issues-but-overall-fantastic">Great, Useful, Super Small Minor Issues but Overall Fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son convinced me to get this as he has a growing interest in golf. My husband and him use this almost everyday. We set it up in our basement, in less than 10 minutes. The side wings were what we really needed as my son sometimes shanks it left or rights. This net holds up strong, stops everything, and can fold up easily. It is about 10 ft wide by 7.5 ft tall, seems a little to short but we have hit it only once or twice close to the top, nothing ever goes over. Two problems are that the wings are attached by nots, which do hold it up but their are some gaps between the main net and wings. Causes a little worry but we&rsquo;ve only hit it through their once, and it still slowed it down not causing any damage to the wall. Secondly, the mat. This mat has great turf, three different types of grass. But one problem is that it does not have a non slip bottom so it does slip back and forth a lot on your hits. I personally sometimes use the mat but also just hit it off the carpet, which does no damage. I recommend buying another mat that is non slip and also can hold a tee.All in all this is a great product recommend it to everyone!</p>

<h5 id="unless-you-live-on-a-golf-course-you-need-a-driving-net">Unless you live on a golf course; you NEED a Driving Net!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. More portable and compact than I thought it would be. The net comes with a canvas bag which easily holds it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend-can-t-find-better-quality-for-the-price">Highly recommend. Can&rsquo;t find better quality for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this net. I also added an extra layer for security because I use it indoor, in my living room.</p>

<h5 id="great-hitting-net">Great hitting net</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This a great net. The frame is heavy duty and the hitting mat that came with it is one of the best I&rsquo;ve used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the">Not worth the $$$</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>mat is pealing from base after 300 golf balls. &ldquo;Rough&rdquo;&hellip;.more like fairway. Don&rsquo;t expect the tee to not come flying out every swing with driver. Nets decent .</p>

<p>Heavy duty net catches every thing I hit at it. The video on the website is the best way to figure out assembly. After the initial assembly it goes up quickly.</p>
