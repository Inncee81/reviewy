<h5 id="i-m-glad-that-i-bought-it">I&rsquo;m Glad That I Bought It</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 85MB/s 64GB Micro SD comes with the full size adapter and formatted exFAT, with the final capacity of 60.5GB. This model that I purchased is the UHS speed class U1 standard, which is what the SD Association recommends for everything except 4K recording. For 4k recording, a card capable of 30MB/s or better write speeds is what you should purchase.I have several of the UHS class cards from different manufacturers ranging from the earlier 50MB/s class to the 90MB/s models and I have no complaints with this card, it&rsquo;s been fast and perfect.As much as I dislike amateur bench marking, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I found out from 3 different programs, while using 2 different USB 3 readers. The read speed is capable of over 85MB/s and was up to 89 in one test, the writes came in slow at 22MB/s. But the write speed is normal for this card because the minimum write speed standard for UHS U1 is only 10MB/s. If you&rsquo;re looking for the faster write speed, then you want the more expensive 45/90MB/s model. With UHS U3 cards, the minimum write speed standard is 30MB/s instead of the UHS U1 10MB/s write speed like this model.Edit: I just stopped back here to take a look and I feel the need to add this because I&rsquo;m seeing disappointed buyers. I apologize to those who know all of this and find it redundant.Addressing the several reviews that complain that this drive isn&rsquo;t really 64GB, that&rsquo;s the size of the drive before formatting. This isn&rsquo;t some bait and switch, this is how all formatted drives work and if you check your computers 1TB drive or whatever it uses, you&rsquo;ll see that it isn&rsquo;t 1TB after formatting either, this is completely normal.Addressing those who think that this doesn&rsquo;t reach it&rsquo;s advertised speeds, I suggest that you download ATTO and or CrystalDiskMark, run it and watch what happens. What you&rsquo;ll find out is that it depends on file sizes and whether they&rsquo;re sequential or random reads, and that it should reach 85 MB/s or very close, using USB 3. If it doesn&rsquo;t, exchange it because mine does. But that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s max, and very small random reads are slow. Do the same with 5 other cards and they will all behave the same way. But if you don&rsquo;t know how to test drives or you received a bad card, writing a review that&rsquo;s misinformation isn&rsquo;t helping anyone, this is why I dislike amateur benchmarking. Doing my very best I&rsquo;m still not in a laboratory using millions of dollars in testing gear, but at least I do know how to interpret the benchmarking results, and the card that I purchased exceeds the advertised speed. <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub> and the card is still good.Another edit: I have just replied to a comment made towards the SDA and myself accusing us of having a lessor intelligence quotient than some readers here, and I only bring this up to defend the SDA who cannot respond. 4k video does not record at 30 MB/s and neither the SDA nor I have said that it does. But a card&rsquo;s class rating, and the synthetically bench marked speed, and the real world speed, and the actual speed when it&rsquo;s used in your camera, will all be different. This card is in the write speed class rated at 10 MB/s because it doesn&rsquo;t reach 30 MB/s and this class would also include slower 5 year old Class 10 cards struggling to reach a 10 MB/s write speed.The testing to reach 10 MB/s would also all be done with a brand new card containing no information, and as it gets older and full, you will experience slower write speeds. So the SDA made a safe, blanket statement about this class of cards use with 4k and I repeated their safe statement because it will be true much more often than it will be false, with so many more old cards when compared to what was released just 6-8 months ago. My apologies for any confusion and here&rsquo;s a rule of thumb: You don&rsquo;t want to use an older Class 10 card for recording 4k, and that&rsquo;s this cards write speed class too. But because this card writes at twice the minimum speed, it will likely work for you when it&rsquo;s new, although that could change with age and how close to full it gets. The faster 30+ MB/s write speed cards should always work for you unless there&rsquo;s a compatibility issue, even when it&rsquo;s old and nearly full.The write speed of this 64GB card of mine in real world performance when new, was at 16-17 MB/s in my computer and will no doubt be much slower when it&rsquo;s closer to full, and I can&rsquo;t say how fast it will write in your camera. Again, here on 1/12/16 my card is performing flawlessly in my tablet. It&rsquo;s a good card, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be my choice when purchasing one for recording 4k.64GB Micro SD cards have typically been a bit faster writing than the same card in 32 or 16GB and I think that&rsquo;s true here with this card also. 128GB Micro SD cards have been slower in comparison until just recently when Samsung introduced it&rsquo;s new 128GB Micro Pro Plus <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>95</sub> card, so that will be changing when everyone catches up, and SanDisk offers the same speed in up to 64GB. Over time and use your card will slow down but you can do a full format on it with your computer to speed it back up again, because this will &lsquo;clean&rsquo; it, unlike quick formats. So give that a try if your card has slowed down.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;This has been used as the write disk in my tablet for about three weeks now and it&rsquo;s been reliable, but one reason for choosing this card was from my own past experience. About 18 months ago I took a chance on an inexpensive 64GB flash drive to be used as an external, second drive with my little Intel NUC computer and it&rsquo;s been running full time ever since without a problem.You guessed right, the thumb drive is also a Silicon Power and I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m taking a chance this time.So then you must also know that from my own experience with this company and this purchase, that I recommend this card.</p>

<h5 id="best-value-high-speed-microsd-card-i-m-aware-of">Best value high speed microSD card I&rsquo;m aware of</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent price for the speed and capacity. Purchased for use in a GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Only had one hiccup. GoPro reported an SD card error after a very long sustained recording, but I popped it into a PC and the recordings made that evening were intact. Still not sure what the source of the error was. May have been the camera, which I&rsquo;ve had very little experience with. I&rsquo;ve attached ATTO benchmark results using a Lexar USB 3.0 microSD reader. Given the camera use case, I&rsquo;m more concerned with write speed than the advertised read speed. Both seem to be adequate.It&rsquo;s important to remember the distinction between figures in megabITS per second and megaBYTES per second. &ldquo;MB&rdquo; is megabytes, &ldquo;Mb&rdquo; is megabits. If this card writes at 20 MBps, that&rsquo;s more than adequate for the bitrate of video the GoPro seems to record.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Silicon Power 64GB up to 85MB/s MicroSDXC UHS-1 Class10, Elite Flash Memory Card:When formatted under Windows 10 with the exFAT file system, it has 58.2GB formatted capacity, which is a little short. A &ldquo;64GB&rdquo; card should have a real-world capacity of 59.6GB, so it has about 98% of its rated capacity (it shows a raw capacity a little over 62.5GB). So I suppose that&rsquo;s close enough to call it a 64GB card, but it is a little over a gig shy of that.I ran a few quick read/write tests under Linux which yielded 84.6 MB/s read and 17.4 MB/s write when installed in the built-in SD card slot of my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Ultrabook. I used a short microSD adapter I found on ebay that doesn&rsquo;t stick out of the slot, so I don&rsquo;t know how much that (or the card reader itself) affected the test, but seeing as the read speed is on par with the manufacturer&rsquo;s rating, it seems okay. Tried the test again in a USB 3.0 card reader connected to a USB 3.0 hub and got a slightly faster 18.3 MB/second write.This card is rated as UHS-1, which means a minimum of 10 MB/second write speed, which it easily beat. I ran the test several times using different block sizes and the slowest I got was 15 MB/second, so it&rsquo;s 50% faster than its rating for writes. It&rsquo;s also rated by the maker as having a read speed of 85 MB/second, and I got 84.6 in my quick test using 4K blocks, so I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s close enough to be accurate.Nice to see a quality card at a bargain price that actually meats or exceeds its rated specs. So many of these products fall very short of their specs. This is one of those rare too-good-to-be-true products that really does deliver.Mad props to Silicon Power! You&rsquo;ve delivered a great product at a great price. Just don&rsquo;t get cocky and raise the price, okay?EDIT: 05-31-2016Ran a full write/read data integrity and capacity test today to get the low down on this card.The good news is it passed with flying colors. Not a single bit lost or corrupted during the test. But as I suspected from my initial experience with the card, it&rsquo;s a little shy of 64GB. Based on the formatted capacity I had estimated it was a little less than 1.5 GB short of the full 64 billion byte capacity (see above where I say &ldquo;it shows a raw capacity a little over 62.5GB&rdquo;). Now I have the exact numbers.122,110,720 sectorsx 512 bytes (per sector)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;= 62,520,688,640 bytes- 64,000,000,000 subtract 64 billion (64GB)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-1,479,311,360 = how much more capacity it <em>should</em> have (1.48GB).As I suspected, just a little under 1.5GB shy of the full advertised capacity. A little disappointing, but considering the performance I&rsquo;ve been getting out of this card, and the sub $15 price when I bought it, I&rsquo;m still very happy with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this memory card for my Galaxy S5, and it performed well. When I upgraded to an S7 Edge, I popped the card into the S7, and it works like a dream.I&rsquo;m not a techie-type person. In fact, I know practically nothing about phones, computers, etc, except the basics of how to operate the ones I own.When I needed a memory card, I asked my son what he recommended, and he sent me a link to this card. That&rsquo;s how I &ldquo;chose&rdquo; it. ;)If you are like me (technically challenged!), but need a memory card for your S5 or S7, then this is a good pick. I popped it in, it worked, it was easy to move my photos over to the card. Once I put the card into my phone, my phone automatically began putting new photos onto the card. Easy-peasy! =)I can heartily recommend this card for your Samsung S5 or S7 phone. =)</p>
