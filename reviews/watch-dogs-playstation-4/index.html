WATCH_DOGS
All it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what’s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.</p>

<p>view larger
In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (ctOS) and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents.</p>

<p>You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you&rsquo;ll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy, and more.</p>

<p>Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.</p>

<h5 id="good-game">Good game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s common knowledge that the PS4 is lacking a bit in the game department. There aren&rsquo;t too many great games to choose from. Watch Dogs is a nice addition though.Watch Dogs is a pretty good game. It&rsquo;s not amazing but it&rsquo;s good. I plan on playing it all the way through. I put some time into it last weekend. It&rsquo;s a Grand Theft Auto kind of game but still different so don&rsquo;t expect the same thing. This is less focused on violence but violence is still there. If you&rsquo;re looking for a PS4 GTA then this should hold you over until it gets made. I&rsquo;ve also seen some nudity and sex scenes so it&rsquo;s definitely earned the mature rating. Very entertaining though! I definitely laughed a few times while playing.Hacking is cool. You can control street lights and cause accidents for example. You can profile every person in the game and hack into a lot of their phones and computers. Sometimes you steel from their bank accounts and other times you get to hear their phone conversations. Some side missions are also unlocked this way. It&rsquo;s often entertaining when you spy on someone in their home. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything repeated while hacking so that&rsquo;s been refreshing. The hacking focused side quests are puzzle like. They require you to explore and figure out how to get from A to Z. Sometimes hacking requires you to complete a puzzle mini game to gain access to whatever you&rsquo;re hacking into. It&rsquo;s not annoying in any way and it&rsquo;s not done too often.Game play is focused on hacking and stealth plays a big part in it all. However, you can often go in guns blazing if stealth isn&rsquo;t your thing. You use security cameras A LOT. This allows you to scout areas and unlock things you can&rsquo;t reach on foot. Hacking is easy to figure out. The shooting mechanics work well in my opinion. It was easy to learn. The AI is easy to fool as well (allows you to sneak up behind them). You also have the ability to slow time which makes killing and driving easier and often more fun. Slowing time is one of many perks you can choose to unlock as you level up. The perk system adds to the overall quality of this game.Driving is arcade style, which I also enjoy because it&rsquo;s easier to learn. Each car drives noticeably different too. Good cars are not hard to come by so that adds to the enjoyment. You also have the ability to make any car you&rsquo;ve used in the past appear near you using a friend in your phone. You&rsquo;ll have to pay to unlock most of the cars but that&rsquo;s been a nice option in the game. You can plow through most obstacles and this also adds to the entertainment.The main story is ok, nothing special in my opinion. Definitely not bad though. There are a ton of side quests to complete and things to find outside of the main story missions. The digital trips put a cool spin on the game. The spider tank digital trip is a ton of fun if you like mass destruction and causing chaos. The other three have been entertaining as well. These have their own perk system too.The city feels alive and it reacts to your choices. There is a karma system that punishes you for doing bad things (like running over pedestrians or killing cops). So far I&rsquo;ve noticed that when my karma is bad, citizens recognize me from the news and call the police. I think good karma has rewards too but I haven&rsquo;t been nice enough to receive any lol. I have neutral karma at the moment and it is relatively easy to remain neutral. I went out of my way to be bad and then I noticed the consequences. Citizens will also call the police if you start shooting or running around with a gun. You can stop the phone calls by shooting that person or grabbing their phone. Bad guys can also call in reinforcements. Sometimes when you steal a car the victim calls the police too. The realism of the game has been enjoyable.I&rsquo;ve heard the PS3 version is crap compared to the PS4 version so keep that in mind. Load times are long at first but once the game is started, it&rsquo;s not bad. I haven&rsquo;t noticed objects randomly popping up into view or similar issues. The frame rate has been steady so far. I&rsquo;ve only had one glitch while playing (a character during a cut scene was invisible). Graphics are cool but not consistent. Sometimes the game looks great and sometimes I think it&rsquo;s lacking. Overall though, I can&rsquo;t complain. Still, I often wonder how much is lost when a game is playable on multiple console generations&hellip;One downside is moving on foot. It&rsquo;s not as streamlined as I would like. Assassin&rsquo;s Creed is a good example of streamlined movement. It&rsquo;s a hassle climbing up and down things in this game. You can&rsquo;t fall very far without dying either. It&rsquo;s realistic but takes away from the overall experience. That&rsquo;s really my only big complaint.Online stuff has been a lot of fun too. It is incorporated into the actual game in multiple ways. One example occurs when you hack certain civilians. These people are waiting to be hacked and report you to the authorities. This puts a bounty on you and other players randomly come into your game and attempt to hack you. You know the area they are in but you have to search for that person before the time runs out. Otherwise the hacker gets paid and you lose online stats. Online stats also allow you to unlock items.All in all, I&rsquo;m happy I purchased the game. If you have a question, I&rsquo;ll respond!</p>

<h5 id="great-first-entry">Great first entry</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Late to the game but that just meant I got to play it after all the bugs were patched. I know a lot of people felt the game didn&rsquo;t live up to the graphical promise made when it was first announced but this is still a great looking game. For a brand new IP that Ubisoft wants to compete with the likes of GTA, I think this was a great starting point. The story was good, the characters were interesting, the game world was large, varied, and interesting. The gunplay functioned well. The stealth mechanics functioned well. The side content was fun. The hacking was their niche mechanic and the big draw and worked but can use improvement, especially when driving. In my opinion the driving mechanics were the weakest gameplay aspect and took awhile to get the hang of but they were still better than the driving in games like Sleeping Dogs and Just Cause 2&hellip;driving in those games was absolutely horrible in my opinion. Even though Chicago has the L-Train, I just never saw any reason to use it to get around so that was kind of a wasted element&hellip;but then again the subway in Los Santos in GTA5 was basically worthless as well. All in all, this was a great game that I played about 40-50 hours total and completed just about everything. If they can improve on what they have built then future installments can rival GTA.</p>

<h5 id="where-to-start-on-this-train-wreck">Where To Start On This Train Wreck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Watch_Dogs made a splash when it was first announced as it promised a new approach to open world gameplay in a totally interconnected world. Hack anything! Go in guns blazing! Be a shadow who moves in silence!As usual, when you see a promise for the moon be prepared for the reality. Watch_Dogs isn&rsquo;t the worst game I&rsquo;ve ever played, but it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to be tired of it. A great story can save shoddy gameplay, and an incredibly fun gameplay system can allow a player to overlook a lacking narrative, but Watch_Dogs can&rsquo;t deliver either. The gameplay has some neat ideas, but it&rsquo;s more of a chore to play than a joy. As for the narrative, wow, it&rsquo;s hard to think of a more unlikable protagonist in recent memory. I actively wanted this character to get killed, and the world he inhabited wasn&rsquo;t much better. Tired &lsquo;hacker&rsquo; tropes, some almost impressively bad morality perspectives, and a gameplay feature that is basically continuous invasions of privacy all work toward making you wonder why you&rsquo;re even playing.I won&rsquo;t rate the title a one star, because the art design is actually pretty nice and there are some good foundational gameplay mechanics that might spawn a much better sequel. Also, there is one very positive thing I will say for Watch_Dogs. It made playing Shadow Of Mordor all the better in comparison.</p>

<h5 id="tbh">Tbh &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got this game in the mail today - So far I&rsquo;ve only been playing for about the last 2-3 hours this late afternoon . It seems like a really cool game - Hacking into all of the cTos systems and hacking into pedestrians cellphones . I find it interesting just roaming around seeing what they&rsquo;re convicted of what their occupation is or their secrets 😂 Im still getting used to everything within the game but it seems alright for now . Im more of a GTA5 girl so this is kindve new for me . The driving and shooting controls are about the same I believe . However driving in this game sucks . Reminds me back to where I use to play True Crimes NYC on PS2 - the way the driving is is just the same . Of course because they&rsquo;re both made by UbiSoft . I hate their driving (it seems like everything just bounces off of each other like it&rsquo;s not quite as realistic to GTA5 driving) . This is hard to explain - I&rsquo;m sorry 😂 Get the game though - It&rsquo;s pretty decent 👌🏾</p>
