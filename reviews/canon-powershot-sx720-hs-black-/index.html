<p>Powerful 40x Optical Zoom with Intelligent IS helps optimize image stabilization for virtually shake-free images.</p>

<p>40x Optical Zoom (24–960mm)
With the PowerShot SX720 HS camera in hand, you&rsquo;ll be impressed at the zooming capabilities of this slim, compact digital camera. The amazing 40x Optical Zoom lens is newly designed, packing high zoom power into a slim design to get you down on the field, high atop a skyscraper, deep into a landscape and much more. The camera’s advanced technology helps ensure that images and videos are captured in outstanding quality, with Intelligent IS that chooses the stabilization method that matches the shooting conditions, so images are virtually shake-free in a wide variety of situations.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies a suitable shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make effective IS settings to help capture a steady image.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Built-in Wi-Fi** and NFC◊ allows for easy sharing and transferring of images and videos.</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi** Technology Makes Sharing Quick and Easy
Built-in Wi-Fi technology allows for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends and family. Easily post your images to select social networking and media sites – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Google Drive – through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY* directly from your PowerShot SX720 HS camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both compatible iOS and Android devices<strong>, and upload images via the free Canon Camera Connect app</strong> without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to select groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras, which record video using the easy-to-share MP4 format. Wi-Fi capability makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with photos and video even as events unfold. Wi-Fi technology also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer. Thanks to the newly added Wi-Fi Button, you can now connect in both Shooting mode and Playback mode for quick and easy operation. You can even turn on the camera and connect at the same time with just one press of the button, helping you get right to sharing and managing your files when you like.</p>

<p>Built-in NFC◊ (Near Field Communication) Technology
PowerShot digital cameras with built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology provide fast connectivity with a single tap. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android™ device◊, and the Camera Connect app will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn&rsquo;t been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-equipped device with the Canon Camera Connect app** installed, and a Wi-Fi connection is established – no camera operations required. Even if your camera is off, NFC turns the camera on and establishes the connection (confirming the camera&rsquo;s nickname and privacy settings before the first connection is required).</p>

<p>Image Sync Function
In addition to wirelessly transferring photos and videos through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY* to your computer, you can now view and download them from your compatible smartphone.# Take them where you like, when you like, and use your familiar smartphone operations to view and share them.</p>

<p>Remote Shooting with the Camera Connect App**
With the built-in Wi-Fi on the PowerShot SX720 HS camera, you can use your compatible smartphone or tablet** to remotely control the camera. Simply connect wirelessly to your device and access the free Canon Camera Connect app**. Your device will show a live image of the camera&rsquo;s capture – ideal for a commemorative group photo, wildlife shots and all kinds of situations.

<p>20.3 Megapixel* CMOS sensor with DIGIC 6 Image Processor helps deliver stunning image quality even in low light.
20.3 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor
The PowerShot SX720 HS camera employs a 20.3 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers powerful imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for high ISO capture with reduced noise. It&rsquo;s also incredibly fast, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, as well as enabling fast continuous shooting and fast autofocus.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>DIGIC 6 Image Processor
The PowerShot SX720 HS camera is equipped with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which helps boost image quality in both stills and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to help create video that&rsquo;s virtually free of distortion. The processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot SX720 HS camera, enabling high-speed, high-quality continuous still image shooting at up to 5.9 frames per second. And video recording is impressive as ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD at 60p, as well as MP4 recording. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on compatible mobile devices. Plus, with MF Peaking, made possible thanks to the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, you&rsquo;ll have a pro-level focusing tool at your disposal.</p>

<p>Capture spectacular 1080p Full HD video at 60p with stereo sound.
The PowerShot SX720 HS camera is designed to make beautiful, creative video capture easy and fun. Image quality is luminous and lifelike in 1080p Full HD, with selectable frame rates of 60p, 30p and 24p to match the situation and end use. MP4 format, ideal for sharing and playing on mobile devices, is also available. Dynamic IS offers 5-axis image stabilization that can correct strong camera shake that can occur when you shoot while running or walking backward.</p>

<p>Large 3.0-inch LCD (approx. 922,000 dots) allows easy viewing even from a wide angle.
The large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of approximately 922,000 dots helps make even small details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle, so showing others what you&rsquo;ve captured is easy, too.</p>

<p>Zoom Framing Assist allows the camera to automatically zoom in or out while following the movement of your subject and help it to remain in focus.
With its 40x Optical Zoom lens, the PowerShot SX720 HS camera has the telephoto reach to capture subjects a long distance away. At maximum telephoto, however, it can be challenging to track a moving subject. The Zoom Framing Assist seek function makes it much easier to use the camera&rsquo;s powerful zoom lens. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you&rsquo;re ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position.</p>

<p>Zoom Framing Assist offers a seek assist function that detects when you&rsquo;re panning (for instance, to search for the location of a soccer player) and automatically zooms out to help; stop panning, and the zoom returns to its original position. Zoom Framing Assist keeps your subject&rsquo;s face the same size in your frame no matter how they move. Tap the Zoom Framing Assist function button to detect your subject&rsquo;s face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It&rsquo;s especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. The feature has been further enhanced by letting you choose the subject&rsquo;s size: choices include face, upper body, whole body, manual or off for superior assistance and control. And, for even more convenience, all Zoom Framing Assist functions are also available when shooting video.</p>

<p>Story Highlights enables the camera to automatically compile images and videos* from a certain day or event into a mini highlight reel with music and effects.
View your still images and video* as a fun short story with the Story Highlights feature on the PowerShot SX720 HS camera. Improved for convenience, you can choose to have the camera create this reel automatically by using advanced algorithms to classify your images according to date, event or people, then compiling a short video of approximately three minutes** with suitable background music and color effects applied. You can also customize your Story Highlights reel for a fun, unique video. Story Highlights BGM lets you add background music (choose from three pre-loaded songs) to the clips that Story Highlights automatically generates, for a new level of emotive expression. It&rsquo;s all done in camera, without the need for any additional software. Easily access and enjoy your Story Highlights – simply press the Story Highlights button to start creating your highlight album. The Story Highlights album can be saved to the camera&rsquo;s memory card for quick replay and also shared using the PowerShot SX720 HS camera&rsquo;s built-in Wi-Fi technology.</p>

<ul>
<li>Videos must be shot in Hybrid Auto or Short Clip.</li>
</ul>

<p>** Length of highlight video varies according to the photos and videos added to the Story Highlights album.</p>

<p>Creative Shot mode uses composition, color and lighting from your original image to create unique images with an artistic flair.
Not only is the PowerShot SX720 HS camera a stylish powerhouse, the camera also enables you to easily create artistic images with Creative Shot mode. In Creative Shot mode, the camera captures the original composition, automatically produces and saves five additional copies of the image and uses advanced Canon technologies to apply any of 46 filter options based on the individual scene, subject and exposure. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or you can simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result can lead to stunning artistic photos that are ideal for sharing.</p>

<h5 id="superb-camera">Superb Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a superb camera. I grew tired of always having to lug around one of my DSLRs anytime I went out so I started looking at a few Point and Shoot options. I decided to buy the Canon Powershot 720 HS after reading some of the reviews on Amazon, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The camera is compact and elegant and feels wonderful in your hand. It is a fully manual camera that allows you to set the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, which is exactly what I was looking for in a Point and Shoot. The camera has a 40X zoom lens, but do not try to zoom out too far without mounting the camera on a tripod or stabilizing it another way. The image quality is excellent, and if you don’t tell anyone the images came from a Point and Shoot, they’d easily think they came from a mid-range DSLR with a good lens.I’ve had the camera now for a few weeks, and I’ve tested it both in the daytime and nighttime. In bright daylight, images come out crisp and richly saturated. At night, the camera performs well, especially if you use a tripod. I rarely use any of my DSLRs at night without a tripod unless I’m using a lens with a really wide aperture, so I’ve grown accustomed to mounting my cameras on tripods. You can get very sharp, high-quality images with this camera at night if you mount the camera. You’re able to do exposures lasting up to 15 seconds, and the images look great. I have not tested the video capabilities of the camera yet, but I will get to it eventually. For me, video capture is a nice option to have, but not something I am really interested in at this point. My main focus (pun intended) is taking still images.If you’re looking for a high-quality, elegant Point and Shoot, this is the camera. I am planning on traveling a lot soon, and I think I am going to leave home all of my DSLRs and lenses and just bring this camera with me. Sometimes less is more, especially with a powerful little camera like this one.</p>

<p>Perfect small camera with incredible zoom. This is just the thing for nature lovers who love to zoom but don&rsquo;t want to haul heavy equipment all day. I love mine and have been using it for several weeks. I bought it at Best Buy (sorry Amazon) because they carry it in red. The dragonfly was about 15ft away. I was very impressed with the clarity. I&rsquo;m an amateur photographer with quite a few cameras and this is my current favorite.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-camera-with-a-fantastic-zoom">A Great Camera with a Fantastic Zoom!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is what I like:~Very good photo quality, with sharp detail and accurate colors~Good video quality, with only a little noise from the zoom motor.~Flash evenly distributes light~Image Stabilizer is very effective, for both photos and videos~Full manual controls are available (photos only)~Menus are very easy to use~Plenty of features~40x zoom is the longest I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a camera that can fit in your pocket!~Canon&rsquo;s unique &ldquo;Zoom Assist&rdquo; feature is very helpful when I&rsquo;m photographing birds that are constantly flying out of my screen&rsquo;s view.~LCD screen is big and clear~&ldquo;ECO&rdquo; mode will turn off the camera&rsquo;s screen after the it&rsquo;s not been used for awhile and bring it back on at the press of any button; that&rsquo;s greatfor saving battery power! It can be turned on or off.~Video record button is conveniently placed on the top of the camera.Here is what I don&rsquo;t like:~There is no panorama mode, which is surprising because most other cameras have one. I do miss having it, but it can be overlooked.~The &ldquo;Sport&rdquo; mode is useless because although most cameras&rsquo; sport modes boost the shutter speed to help you capture fast-moving subjects, all this one does is turn on continuous shooting, which is already available in the other modes! That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, but it&rsquo;s not a big problem because I can set shutter speed manually in Tv mode.Overall, there are way more good points than bad, and I am so happy I chose this camera!J. M. B.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THe Cannon Shot 720x is an amazing camera. I have shelved my larger more sophisticated ones. I have had the Powershot series for several years now, and the amateur photos I take with it, have earned me 4 awards including &ldquo;grand prize&rdquo; and &ldquo;people&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; in 2 years, against professional photographers with much more complicated equipment. This camera is lighter and more compact that its predecessor model with a better zoom. It also take better landscape photos. The Image World is also first rate to deal with, I did have an issue with the first camera sent, and the staff of The Image World have been quick to respond and are sending a new replacement. I take wild life photos and there is often no time for set up, so if you want an amazing wild life or people shot taken with a great zoom, this is the camera.</p>

<h5 id="probably-the-world-s-best-pocket-camera">Probably the world&rsquo;s best pocket camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received this from my husband as a gift. I&rsquo;m an arthritic old lady who loves to photograph wildlife, especially birds. I&rsquo;ve been walking around with an SX710 in my pocket for months and love being able to quickly pull my camera out of my pocket, take a telephoto picture, upload it to my cell phone, and post it online in a matter of a couple of minutes. The SX720 does all that even better. The longer optical zoom is great, and the inage stabilization is noticely better with the SX720. The camera and wifi interface is identical for both cameras, so if you are accustomed to the SX710 there is no learning curve at all when you upgrade. And last but not least, the SX720 seems to be a trifle smaller and lighter than the 710.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-little-camera">Awesome little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome little camera. Better battery life than the last model, but no GPS, which I suppose is the reason for the better battery life. Fantastic zoom and amazingly acceptable digital zoom!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-point-shoot-camera">Excellent Point &amp; Shoot Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera as a replacement for one (same model) that disappeared when I was traveling. I used the previous one for a year and a half.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A eye view along with screen would be nice, great for long shots, lightweight</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="camera-control-app-will-not-shoot-video">Camera Control App Will Not Shoot Video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera because I wanted something sturdy, and smaller and lighter than a SLR, to take on live performances of my folk group to shoot videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-camera">Easy to use camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent camera with a good zoom. My only concern was holding the camera steady when using the zoom. Easy to use otherwise. And it fits in a small bag or purse.</p>

<p>LOVE this camera!Since we&rsquo;ve had cameras on mobile phones, I&rsquo;ve primarily used my phone camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointed">Very disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very upset with this purchase. I read all the good reviews before I purchased the camera, so I trusted the buy. Not worth almost $300.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<p>Love it. Need to learn more about it. Can&rsquo;t wait to take pics of my newborn boy</p>
