<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-unit-with-one-caveat">Great unit with one caveat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off I loaded this unit up, attached to my Speedlight, and never changed batteries once during an entire wedding. Rock solid performance, easy to load and unload batteries, nice unit. I love seeing the red blinking lights to know what is happening. Make sure you read that part on HOW it works. The lights blink rapidly means it has juice and is ready to go, they blink slow means change batteries, and when it is solid it is actively charging the flash.The one caveat is you cannot use this unit with the 580 EXII in the custom function mode that charges the flash from the external battery pack only. I attempted to use this feature 3 times and everytime the lights just kept blinking fast and once the flash was discharged (I did a test fire with pilot button) it never went solid to indicate it was charging. However, once I changed it back to the default to charge from all available sources, it went back to working like a charm. So just make sure you don&rsquo;t have that function enabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-results-with-this-product">Good results with this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchase three of these battery packs to power my Canon Speedlites (2-550EX &amp; 1- 580 EXII) for a church Christmas program. I took over 400 pictures of kids with Santa and never had a single problem. The Speedlites recycled quickly and the batteries held up very well (I used the eight battery configuration). When the event was over, the AA batteries tested with about 40% power remaining in each one. Cables from the pack to the flash fit very well and snug - cables are of good quality. Overall quality for the money is most acceptable.I was pleased with the Pixel TD-381 and consider it a good buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job-with-no-fuss-now-twice-the-price-i-bought-them">Does the job with no fuss - now twice the price I bought them.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these to power a 580Ex-II and a YN560-II and they both work just fine.I never had other equivalent, therefore I cannot compare.I have had them for a few months now and I systematically use at least one of them when shooting on location.The build is a little light, and I am not sure how long the tray locking mechanism will hold, but without abusing them so far so good.I don&rsquo;t mind the need to thread the belt through the pouch - it may be a little awkward to remove you belt in public but I would rather that than having the batteries drop accidentally on hard floor.I don&rsquo;t use the bolt to attach the pack under the camera or anywhere else - I use two strong rubber bands to attach them to the light stand when shooting the flash through a softbox or I have the pack attached to my belt or in my backpack - the cable is long enough for me.Someone else was bemoaning the quality of the nylon pouch - I have no problem there, I think it looks nice enough and does the job very decently. I just make sure I attach it to my belt with the velcro on top so that if ever the snap button fails, the assembly will not be able to slip to the ground thanks to the cable being in the way.I confirm that the 580Ex-II will not recharge from this source only - not a problem for me.Lastly the picture shows two plugs at the end of the cable. Mine came with just one plug that matches both of my speedlights&rsquo; socket, so this is not a problem for me.I use them with eneloop and I have only good experience so far._____________________________________________<strong><em>A year and a half later - still happy although I don&rsquo;t use them as much as I thought.The other night I went to the school ballet, set in a big gymnasium with so many people sitting on the bleachers that noone could move around. The lighting conditions were very poor, with a mix of tungsten and various halogen lamps with spectrum all over the place, sure to ruin everyone&rsquo;s pictures taken without a flash - then the costumes were mostly reflective/shiny white and mat black, an interesting test for ETTL especially on fast moving targets.So.I just hung up a 580ExII set in manual <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> power 105mm with one of these battery packs on one end of the bleachers, a good 50 feet from the area where the kids evolved, and a Yongnuo 560II also set to manual <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> power 105mm with another power pack on the other end of the bleachers, high enough to clear all the heads, and I was able to pick full-frame dancers at ISO800 with an f/4 lens.All in all about 350 frames with fresh batteries, although after an hour or so of shooting I started to get darker images (triggering before full recharge), single flash images (one flash had not recycled yet) and sometimes (oops) black images (a little shutter-happy I guess).Result: I got a few very nice pictures from my kids and their friends dancing. This would not have been possible without the battery packs and I wanted to share that with whoever might be interested.</em></strong>______________I was back to buy two more and I observe the price has more than doubled.I am much less interested at this newer price, reason why I popped a star on my original rating.Please feel free to ask questions in the comments, I make a point of answering them.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-continuous-shooting">Great for Continuous Shooting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality is just fine - it&rsquo;s a battery pack after all. The cable is what&rsquo;s important and the one on the Pixel has strain reliefs on both ends and the jack fits securely into the Speedlite and has a moisture seal.My only complaint was that although there is a belt loop on the case (taking it on and off your belt or just stuffing it into a pocket can be a pain)there was no clip. A couple of minutes with a belt clip off a tape measure and a pop rivet and - problem solved. See the picture above. Now I can clip it on and off quick and easy.As for power it&rsquo;s just awesome. I was in a club last night shooting a band. Took 750 flash shots, most in rapid succession, without a hitch or any noticeable drop in recycle times. The battery power on Maha Powerex 2700 MAH AAs only dropped to 1.29 Volts.Buy one and never miss a shot again due to no flash power.</p>

<h5 id="lacks-only-1-thing">Lacks only 1 thing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it, There is only 1 thing I wish it had and it isn&rsquo;t that major of an idea, it has no on-off button so it is active as soon as you get all the batteries in it and lock it in&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="pixel-td-381-old-version-is-not-compatible-with-pixel-flash-x800c">Pixel TD-381 old version is NOT compatible with Pixel flash X800C.</h5>

<p>Pixel TD381 has old and new version. Old version can ONLY fit (connector) Canon flash 580EX II, new version will fit both Canon 580EX II and Pixel flash X800C.</p>

<h5 id="works-for-its-intended-purpose">Works for its intended purpose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product was as described. So far it is working as it should. This is a good substitute for the Canon battery pack.</p>

<h5 id="not-worth-it">Not worth it.</h5>

<p>I am a professional photographer and I first thought this battery pack was great. After about 5 uses, my flash stop recycling at the same speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">Worth It !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a professional photographer and you can never have to much power in your camera bag. This battery pack has not missed a lick since I got it and the price can not be beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-inside-is-designed-better-than-its-canon-counterpart">The inside is designed better than its Canon counterpart</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not over the moon about this. I got it to replace the Canon battery pack that I have and would probably have stuck with that if I wasn&rsquo;t in a pinch.</p>

<p>Works well but is a bit fragile for extended rugged use.</p>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You Get What You Pay For</h5>

<p>The battery pack works fine. But don&rsquo;t expect it to last for years. My one star review is mostly for customer service of the product. I owned two of these battery packs.</p>
