</ul>

<p>Intelligent Viewfinder with approximately 100% viewfinder coverage.</p>

<p>Providing a bright and comprehensive view, the EOS 80D camera’s Intelligent Viewfinder helps bring the thrill of SLR photography with each use. Approximately 100% coverage means there’s virtually no guesswork when it comes to composition, and with all settings available at a glance, the Intelligent Viewfinder helps photographers keep their eye on their subject so the image can be captured at the right instant. The Intelligent Viewfinder displays AF points and AF mode, has a grid display, a horizontal electronic level, plus numerous other points of information, all of which can be hidden for manual focus, or if the photographer simply wants to observe his/her subject without all the image parameters displayed.</p>

<p>24.2 Megapixel (APS-C) CMOS sensor helps provide impressive, high-resolution results.</p>

<p>The EOS 80D camera features a newly developed 24.2 Megapixel (APS-C) CMOS sensor that not only captures high-resolution images, but also features refined individual pixels that enable high ISO speeds of 16000 for still photographs (expandable to 25600) and 12800 for movies (expandable to 16000, 25600). Equipped with high resolution and high sensitivity, the EOS 80D’s sensor works with the camera’s DIGIC 6 Image Processor to enable Dual Pixel CMOS AF during Live View operation, and while capturing both Full HD 60 fps movies and Full HD HDR movies.</p>

<p>Improved Dual Pixel CMOS AF helps you shoot video with smooth, fast and accurate autofocus, and stills with instant and precise autofocus.
The EOS 80D camera features Canon&rsquo;s improved Dual Pixel CMOS AF for fast and smooth AF during Live View and movie shooting. Boasting enhanced speed, smoother tracking and compatibility with all EF and EF-S lenses, the EOS 80D’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF system excels, providing stellar AF and tracking even in difficult shooting conditions. This Canon technology is made possible by placing two photodiodes per pixel, instead of one, and enabling each pixel to perform phase-difference detection autofocus. This means fast, accurate AF and virtually no loss in image quality with extended coverage across approximately 80% of the image plane.</p>

<p>The benefits of Dual Pixel CMOS AF are clearly evident in video shooting, where bringing scenes and subjects into focus is a critical element of the final composition. On the EOS 80D, Dual Pixel CMOS AF helps ensure focus is achieved naturally and precisely, even when switching between subjects. Combined with the predictive power of Movie Servo AF, subjects in motion are smoothly and consistently tracked – once the EOS 80D locks focus, it virtually doesn&rsquo;t let go.</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi* allows you to wirelessly transfer images and movies to compatible devices or share on social networking sites.
The new EOS 80D camera incorporates wireless technology right into its compact design. The camera&rsquo;s exposure settings, such as aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focus and shutter can be operated wirelessly using a compatible iOS or Android smartphone* with the free Canon Camera Connect app<em>.

The screen is touch-sensitive, delivering intuitive touch panel operation. Two-finger touch gestures can be used for zooming or changing images. Menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip using Touch AF. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen can be ideal for composing and reviewing images. The LCD&rsquo;s surface is also treated with a smudge-resistant coating to help minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display, even in bright light.</p>

<p>DIGIC 6 Image Processor helps provide exceptional image quality and processing speed.
The EOS 80D camera is equipped with Canon’s DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which helps provide excellent image quality and processing speed in both photos and video. High light sensitivity allows for high resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions at ISO 12800. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also powers the camera&rsquo;s performance capabilities, providing full resolution high-speed continuous still shooting and distortion correction in-camera. Video recording in MP4 format provides seamless compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. Recording HD videos using HDR movie feature is possible, expanding creative possibilities.</p>

<p>ISO 100–16000 (expandable to 25600) for stills and ISO 100–12800 (expandable to <sup>16000</sup>&frasl;<sub>25600</sub>) for movies for outstanding performance in bright to dim light.
Thanks to its DIGIC 6 Image Processor and its remarkable noise-reduction technology, the EOS 80D camera features a wide ISO range of ISO 100–16000 (expandable to 25600) for stills and ISO 100–12800 (expandable to <sup>16000</sup>&frasl;<sub>25600</sub>) for movies, performing brilliantly in low-light shooting even without a flash. Used with one of Canon&rsquo;s EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer, the EOS 80D can record beautiful images even when light sources are scarce.</p>

<p>More precise autofocus is provided by the 7560-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor which enables Color Tracking to accurately detect skin color.
Among the advanced electronics onboard the EOS 80D camera, a fine-tuned RGB+IR metering sensor not only helps ensure accurate exposure, but also uses Color Tracking to detect skin color and help provide precise AF. This is particularly useful when establishing focus for portraits in situations where other AF systems may falter. When a skin tone is detected, AI Servo AF starts off on skin-colored points, then tracks the subject based of the original AF point’s color information, maintaining focus on the person even when they’re in motion.</p>

<p>High-speed continuous shooting up to 7.0 fps allows you to capture all the action.
Capable of shooting up to 7.0 fps during continuous shooting, the EOS 80D is an amazing camera for quick action. Canon&rsquo;s remarkable shutter, combined with speedy, sophisticated electronics, helps ensure virtually instant response and performance. A rapidly occurring scene can be captured moment by moment, second by second, so that even brief opportunities are captured in crisp clarity.</p>

<p>Express your creativity with HDR Movie, Time-Lapse Movie and Creative Filter options.
HDR Movie
The EOS 80D camera introduces a number of new HDR (High Dynamic Range) modes that offer a great range of highlight and shadow detail for naturally rendered images, especially in contrasting lighting. In HDR Movie mode, the EOS 80D captures two HD movie frames at different exposures, one standard and one underexposed, in short succession at up to 60 fps, then combines them together for playback at up to 30 fps. HDR effects for still photography include Natural, Art standard, Art bold, Art vivid and Art embossed.</p>

<p>Time-Lapse Movie
The EOS 80D camera has a Time-Lapse Movie feature that takes still photos at set intervals and joins them to create a silent movie. Ideal for showing the moving clouds across the sky, growth of a plant, changes in scenery, the flow of people walking and more, the EOS 80D’s Time-Lapse Movie function creates professional-quality movies in-camera without the need for a computer, saving precious time when out in the field.</p>

<p>Creative Filter Options
To add to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS 80D, the camera has seven different Creative Filters for Live View shooting that can dramatically alter the mood and visual effect of any particular scene. Creative Filters include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, Art Bold Effect and Water Painting Effect. The EOS 80D also adds five new Creative Filters for movie shooting, including Memory, Dream, Old Movies, Dramatic B&amp;W and Miniature Effect movie. Each effect can be applied in three varying levels and easily previewed on the LCD panel in Live View. Since the filters can be applied to the image after shooting, it&rsquo;s easy to try several effects on the same shot during post-process.</p>

<p>Anti-flicker helps compensate for flickering light sources and provides consistent exposure and color during continuous shooting.
The EOS 80D camera features a flicker detection system that not only alerts the user in the viewfinder, but with the camera&rsquo;s Anti-flicker Shooting function can compensate for flickering light sources, taking shots only at peak light volume. This feature is useful for minimizing disparities in color and exposure, especially during continuous shooting in sub-optimal lighting situations.</p>

<p>Shutter durability tested up to 100,000 cycles.
The EOS 80D camera features a powerful mechanical shutter system with electronically controlled speeds from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8000</sub> to 30 sec. at up to 7 fps. An improved mirror drive enables high-speed, low-vibration performance, and even has a silent mode for up to 3 fps, continuous and quiet use. The shutter is rated to 100,000 exposures, resulting in predictable, reliable performance time after time and frame after frame.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>BUILD QUALITY -So let’s first take a look at the build quality and design of the Canon 80d. Now I&rsquo;ve been testing the 80d out for a while now and felt comfortable using it pretty much straight away. That’s because the body itself isn’t changed that much from the old 70d, which his the camera I’ve used for 2 years or so. There are a few new things that have changed though. The buttons on the back of the camera are different and feel a lot easier to use. They’re a little bit more pronounced and this is nice.The grip itself is nice. It’s not a very heavy camera like the Canon 5d or 6d, but it’s also got enough weight on it to easily deal with a heavier lens like the Sigma 18-35mm that I also use. On the side of the camera you’ll also notice a new port, the headphone jack which is something I’ll talk about in a bit. But overall the build quality is fantastic, and to me is the sweet spot size for DSLR’s.- MENUS -Now when I first heard about the new Canon 80d, one thing I didn’t expect to change was the menu system. But it has. It’s now a little bit more compact and is using a new tabbed system rather than the old system. It’s taken me a little bit of time to get used to it but it does seem pretty easy. Fortunately it’s not too overloaded with options, especiaslly for beginners, but if you do put it in manual mode you do get a lot more options to play around wiht.- LCD SCREEN -Now one of the best features of the old Canon 70d was it’s touch screen and I’m pleased to say the Canon 80d is just as good.Because the Canon 80d has such fantastic autofocus, having the touch screen really makes things easy, especially if you want to do some nice focus pulls. I use this nearly overtime i make videos and it’s how I do those product focus pulls from time to time. Of course the 80d’s screen is also articulating and it’s something I couldn’t live without now. Being able to switch it around to any angel is great, especially for someone like me who films all my own videos.It&rsquo;s also a pretty big lcd screen, especially compared to a smaller camera like the Sony A6300 and that’s something I like. It’s deinfitely one of the best LCD screens I’ve ever used.- AUTOFOCUS -One thing that I’ve been incredibly impressed with on the new 80d is it’s autofocus performance. And to be fair I was a little bit sceptical at first. That’s because the Canon 70d’s dual pixel autofocus was so good. But Canon have seemed to have been able to make it quicker and a little bit more acurate. Especially using the LCD on the back.It&rsquo;s incredibly snappy autofocus and when you pair it up with one of the dedicated Canon lenses it really is impressive. I’ve even used it with my Sigma lenses, and it’s pretty consistent across the board.-VIDEO -Now the Canon 70d was one of the most popular video cameras over the last 2 years and for good reason. It’s dual pixel autofocus system was by far the best around. But it was lacking a few things. Firstly it could only shoot 60 frames per second in 720p. Now I’m not a huge fan of filming in 60p, but i was impressed with it. If you want to see a test video I made in 60frames per second, click the link here to see.I didn’t really expect the dual pixel autofocus to be any better than the 70d but it is. Which is pretty incredible. Being able to quickly pull focus using the touch screen is great and the face tracking works pretty well. It does have problems every now and then if you are wearing a hat or sunglasses though. To be fair, the Canon 80d is still lagging a little bit behind in terms of resolution. There are a lot of cameras that have 4k now and it would have been nice to see it included, but I didn’t expect it to be fair.Although it is still only 1080p thought the video quality was nice and I’ll definitely be upgrading to the 80d from my 70d for my future videos.- HEADPHONE JACK -One of my favorite new additions to the Canon 80d is a little inclusion on the side here, a headphone jack. This is something so basic that has been missing from a lot of Canon DSLR’s for so long and it’s great to see it in. Being able to really monitor your audio is huge and it’s worth the upgrade in itself.If you’re going to be filming a lot, then the 80d is definitely going to worst the upgrade.</li>

<p>I have this camera now for about 3 weeks already. This review is based on my day to day usage in realistic shooting conditions.Camera tested With the18-135mm USM Nano (kit lens)10-18mm STM100-400mm II100-400mm II + 1.4X Mk I TC50mm STM55-250mm STM1. BatteryLasts very long. Roughly for me about 1300 pictures with heavy chimping and sending to phone via wi-fi. I do not review my photos in camera much. With that way, I get close to 2000 pictures per charge.Takes about 2 hours to chargeCamera battery meter is fairly accurate2. Auto-focusSpeedy and fastAccurate even under dim lightEven with the 100-400mm II + 1.4X Mk I combo, it was able to AF quickly and accurately under really challenging lighting condition. The challenging condition I refer to is around 6:30pm in evening in Singapore after rain. Infact it was still drizzling. So the light condition was really low. The subject was a rufous woodpecker on a tree bark. Basically not much of contrast in the subject for camera to be able to AF. Despite this, the camera managed to get the AF quickly and accurately. So it passes the AF test for me with full marks.I tried the 100-400mm + 1.4X TC for Birds in flight. The camera was able to get subject in focus quickly and reliably. Passes this test as well. BTW - I am a center AF point person and use AI Servo or AFC modes frequently.The AF with all the above lenses was speedy and accurate.3. ViewfinderIt is bright and provides accurate results as in what I see in view finder is what the captured image contents will be. The viewfinder also has things like grid lines which could help with composition. Or for ensuring level of horizon when shooting landscape. The AF confirmation lights up bright red in dim conditions. It is a good implementation.4. Post processing lattitudeI always shoot in RAW and process photos using lightroom. I always found Canon RAW takes well to post processing and have no problems in recovering highlight and reveal shadow information. The 80D raw files allows a more lattitude in revealing shadow information without introducing noise. One time it happened that the exposure compensation dial accidently got dialed down by about 1.5 stop. Luckily I was able to get back lots of details and colours in post processing.5. ErgonomicsI find the ergonomics excellent for my hands. Everything is good. It is best you handle the camera in a store before buying as everybody has their preference to ergonomics. I can only say based on my own experience, a vast majority of people should be happy with the ergonomics. All the buttons and dialed required by most photographers are there and in th right place.6. Top LCDThere is a top LCD screen that reveals most shooting information a photographer will need.7. Articulating LCDLCD rotates in various angles and directions. I compose mainly using the viewfinder. However I appreciate the fact that LCD can be rotated and stowed away to prevent damage to the LCD screen.8. Value for moneyGiven the specs and functions provided by the 80D, in my opinoin, the 80D is an excellent camera and well worth the moneyOverall it is a great camera and yes I recommend this to my friendsUpdate on 4th July 2016: The camera is awesome. I am getting some really excellent images for landscape and birding. In fact my most frequently used lenses are 10-18mm and 100-400mm II with 1.4X extender. Added a series of bird in flight (pictures of red tailed hawk) captured recently at Mud Bay Park here in Vancouver suburbs. This series shows the tracking capabilities of the 80 with 100-400mm II + 1.4X TC. Even a busy background doesn&rsquo;t throw the camera AF off.My settings for AI Servo areTracking sensitivity: -1Accel/decl tracking: 1AF pt auto switching: +2AI Servo 1st image priority: set to extreme right as in FOCUSAI Servo 2nd image priority: set to extreme right as in FOCUSAuto selection: 45 point AF (not sure how many points camera actually uses during AI servo with the 100-400mm II +1.4X TC)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll read lots of specs about this camera in the reviews so I am going to talk about it from my perspective. I am a massage therapist. I use this camera to vlog about products and techniques. Since I do all my own filming it&rsquo;s nice to have a camera that tracks my movements amazingly well. It&rsquo;s nice and light to carry. I get great quality video from it. I also can plug in my mic and record sound with my video. This camera comes with so many options that make your life easier in post production. You can shoot time lapses, slow motion, etc. People complain about no 4k but I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m not a filmmaker. I&rsquo;m a massage therapist that uses photos for my website, marketing material, and youtube vlogs. This does the job perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-camera">Excellent camera!!</h5>

<p>I spent many weeks reviewing cameras and finally decided on the Canon 80D. I shoot mainly wildlife and have been to Africa twice, using a Nikon D3200. But with another trip booked in September I knew I wanted to step my game up. I finally narrowed down my decision to the 80D and the 7D mark ii and went with the 80D, mainly for the newer features and better image quality. I also purchased the Canon 100-400mm ii lens to round out the perfect safari combination. Then I took my camera and lens to the LA zoo a few days ago and was blown away by the image quality! In one word, amazing!! Check them out for yourself. Both pics are shot at 400mm and look impressively sharp!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned many Canon DSLR cameras over the years and I loved this one so much that I sold my 1D X. Lightweight, great image quality, fast focus acquisition, great high ISO image quality&hellip;really good tracking for BIF. I could go on and on. Mated up with the 100-400 Mk II it&rsquo;s a killer combo. I shoot with friends that have the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; bodies and long prime lenses (like I used to) and find that I get just as good if not better shots than they do.</p>
