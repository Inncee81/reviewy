<h5 id="just-what-my-phone-needed">Just what my phone needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve repaired over a dozen iPhones and this kit by FAR ROCKS&hellip; Best quality tools, and screen (manual is OK, that&rsquo;s why we have YouTube). Only thing you need is 10x magnifier and that is something you should have to see better. VERY GOOD QUALITY!!! The front seal seamed about a 1.0mm thicker and better quality and than the stock one from Apple! No Joke! Will buy from them again! Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-was-able-to-easily-follow-the-instruction-manual-along-with-some-youtube-videos">I was able to easily follow the instruction manual (along with some YouTube videos) &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having never done a phone or computer repair before, I was able to easily follow the instruction manual (along with some YouTube videos) to successfully replace my screen in under one hour. I was really nervous to take on a project like this but am glad I did. This was much more cost effective than taking the phone to the Apple Store for the repair. The images on the screen may be just slightly less crisp than the original screen, but slightly is the key word - hard to tell the difference. For the price, ease of use, and convience, I would recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-tools-included-in-the-package-allow-for-easy-disassembly-while-the-magnetic-diagram-helps-with-organization">The tools included in the package allow for easy disassembly, while the magnetic diagram helps with organization &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Phenomenal. I have replaced many iPhone screens in the past, both Apple OEM and counterfeit.The tools included in the package allow for easy disassembly, while the magnetic diagram helps with organization (screw loss-prevention). All ribbons fastened with little adjusting. Front Camera and speaker/sensor were perfectly aligned with the new screen. Completed in 30 minutes, from sitting down to celebrating. LCD quality is impeccable and the difference isn&rsquo;t detectable to the naked eye (wasn&rsquo;t noticeable by my eyes at least, and I have perfect vision).Screen sat flush against the iPhone chassis with no trouble reattaching, and everything worked as soon as I rebooted. I am going to be using this toolkit to repair friends phones in the future!5 - Star with a smile. (Also, I typed this on my iPhone without slicing my fingers! : ] )Cheers</p>

<h5 id="painless-installation-it-works">Painless installation. It works!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen installed without a hitch. Has worked so far so good for a month now. I&rsquo;ve replaced more than a dozen screens successfully and they all have been consistently easier. Apple has really made improvements on the serviceability of their devices. The tools provided with the kit are sufficient to get most of the job done but you will likely need a heat blower to get the fingerprint scanner electronics easily off the existing hardware. It also has helped me to get one of those double suction cup thingies although you can still get it done with what your provided in this kit. This kit also had a magnetic screw pad to help keep the screws better organized. I usually use 2 inch masking tape flipped up and taped down to my table to keep things organized in the order I remove them but this was kinda handy too; especially if it had been my first trip on the merry go round.I had no need to contact the seller, but it was nice that they sent me some emails to solicit any questions or concerns I might have. I&rsquo;ll be looking for this seller again next time I&rsquo;m in the market for another screen replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-done-replacement">Well done replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good. Got it installed - with about 35-40 mins of careful work.Pros:1. very good packaging and shipping speed.2. Nicely done set of tools and &ldquo;case&rdquo; for the whole kit.3. Pretty good instructions, although YouTube works a treat for this. I recommend looking up &ldquo; replace iPhone 6 screen, with nothing left out&rdquo;.4. If done properly the screen works quite well so far.5. Touch sensitivity is excellent, everything that should work does.Cons:1. Others mentioned a blue cast/tint to the screen color. I also observed this. However, if you use &ldquo;Night shift mode&rdquo;, this phenomenon is largely mitigated.2. One other item that may concern people less careful, is that this fits the iPhone slightly more snugly than the original. This is noted if you had a tight fitted case, as it hits the edge of the new screen. Very minor issue though.Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who feels they have the dexterity to complete the installation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very impressed with this kit! Instructions were understandable and used a large magnetic photo to keep track of screws. The screen looks factory installed so I&rsquo;m satisfied and have been recommending this to others. It only took about 20 minutes to compete.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kit">GREAT KIT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked it. I have replaced 50-60 phone screens and this one was one of the better products I&rsquo;ve purchased. Very well packaged &amp; equipped with everything you&rsquo;d need to do the job. Just make certain the phone is powered-down BEFORE removing the screen from the main motherboard&hellip; otherwise you could blow the back light diode&hellip; and that is not a simple fix!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easiest-iphone-screen-replacement-by-far">Easiest iPhone screen replacement by far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen was delivered quickly and in perfect shape. The delivery case even has a magnetic display to keep track of where each screw goes for replacing. I just wish I had known that was a possibility before replacing all of the screen I have fixed in the past. I will definitely be ordering from SZHSR again. It truly made the replacement process easy, convenient, and stress free. I&rsquo;ve been fixing phones for a long time and will be very skeptical going away from this brand in the future. Hope this helps.</p>

<h5 id="nice-packaging">Nice packaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great packaging with all the tools!!! The LCD isn&rsquo;t obviously original there&rsquo;s a difference but it works&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-except">Great except!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything is great except the screen is dimmer and blue tinted</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cool-extras-screen-too-big">Cool extras, screen too big</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The packaging is great, lots of extra little features. Magnetic screw map with for tools was pretty cool. Only downside was that the screen wasn&rsquo;t a perfect fit for the frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-buy-if-looking-to-change-screens">Must buy if looking to change screens</h5>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The tool kit comes with every possible tool you&rsquo;d need and extras. The tools they provide made it seem like they thought of every way to make it such a simple process.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-great-stuff-good-experience">Overall great stuff good experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Surprisingly the kit came with a screen protector and ring.The replacement process took a little bit longer than I expected but it tunrned out worth it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="everything-on-my-phone-works-like-new-if-you-follow-a-step-by-step">Everything on my phone works like new. If you follow a step by step &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely worth what you pay for! Everything on my phone works like new. If you follow a step by step video you should have no problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-replacement-screen-for-iphone-6">Excellent replacement screen for iPhone 6</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the fourth phone screen I&rsquo;ve replaced using a screen ordered through Amazon sellers. It was the best kit I&rsquo;ve purchased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kit-alright-screen">Great kit, alright screen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent screen. The included instructions aren&rsquo;t great, I&rsquo;d recommend looking around online for a good set before you start.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="images-burned-onto-the-screen">Images burned onto the screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has now been 3 days since the installation of the screen. The phone button, reverse camera button and mute button from face timing have somehow &ldquo;burned&rdquo; a silhouette&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-screen-works-and-was-easy-enough-to-install">The screen works and was easy enough to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen works and was easy enough to install. However, it feels noticeably cheaper than the original screen and the screen has a lighter hue.</p>
