Maintaining good oral health is easy with the Philips Sonicare e-Series Standard toothbrush heads. These screw-on replacement brush heads remove up to 2x more plaque vs. a manual toothbrush. e-Series also features an angled neck and contoured bristles to help you easily maneuver the brush and focus on hard-to-reach areas where plaque can hide. The blue reminder bristles fade to let you know when it&rsquo;s time for replacement. Replace your brush head every 3 months as recommended by the American Dental Association. A fresh brush head every 3 months maximizes the effectiveness of Philips’ unique Sonicare technology.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="buy-the-real-thing">Buy the real thing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE my Sonicare - nothing compares to how clean my teeth feel after every brushing other than the dentist. I highly recommend one to everyone I know. It was the best money I&rsquo;ve spent in a long time. My mouth feels cleaner, longer. My teeth have since whitened&hellip; But on to the review of this product:I originally had purchased the sonicare replacement brush heads, but I felt they were pretty pricey, so I purchased some Wal-Mart special replacement heads. Worst idea EVER. The wal-mart special replacements are loud, not even close to the same quality, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I would get the same clean from just using it manually. I am not even ready to replace my wal-mart heads, and have already bought these, which compared to local prices, is much gentler on the wallet!Conclusion: Buy the real thing, spend the money on the sonicare heads, unless you want to hate your brush. It&rsquo;s not worth the savings, from Wal-mart or wherever, because you&rsquo;ll just be here, buying the real thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-brushes-good-packaging">Great Brushes, Good Packaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t much to say about Sonicare Brushes: once you&rsquo;ve tried them (for us, it&rsquo;s been over 10 years), you&rsquo;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush or anything but Sonicare. Well some of you might, but I need MY teeth to last a long, long time, and these brushes massage the gums without bruising.I, too, am pleased that Sonicare changed the packaging. The old pack of two came in plastic that needed special tools to open. Now, they come in the shown box, and just pop out. No muss, no fuss.Note: To those of you who &ldquo;subscribed&rdquo; to get two brushes every 6 months and haven&rsquo;t received any lately, the old packaging has been discontinued and, evidently, the brush model as well. These are identical to the old brushes, but you might have to re-subscribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-in-less-than-2-months">Broke in less than 2 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The metal strut inside the toothbrush head broke after less than 2 months of use. Now its past the 30 day return period so I am not covered. This is the second time these heads have broken. It&rsquo;s like I use excessive force when brushing. I brush like a normal person who wants clean teeth. I am not sure I will continue using this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bristles-falling-out-and-this-is-the-second-set-doing-this">Bristles falling out and this is the second set doing this!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I need help from the company. This is the second set (we get them every 3 months) that the bristles begin falling out as you are brushing your teeth. It starts within the first few days of using them. It is only a bristle or 2 at a time but it is not good. It gagged me this week. It is happening to both replacement heads on mine and my husbands. We have never had this problem before but the set before this and the current one are doing this. I need them replaced. I would also like to know why this is happening all of a sudden. Once I hear from the company and get resolution, I will update my review. Thank you.Update: I have not heard from the company. I need this resolved by them!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-the-same-shape">Not the same shape</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not the same as ones I get at the store. These look shaved off, note the difference in my pics of my normal brush head, the green is the one I got at the store. The blue are the ones I was sent. Are these damaged? Not sure what to do, they definitely don&rsquo;t clean the same either. The packaging picture shows them to be correct but the product is not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="much-more-comfortable-than-the-regular-brush-head">Much more comfortable than the regular brush head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have lupus and sjogren&rsquo;s and my gums are very fragile. My son (12 years old) has some sensory integration issues that make him hate brushing his teeth. We are both using these brush heads in our e series sonicares, and both of us like them much better than the heads we were using.I was using a regular brush head and dealing with a sink that looked like a crime scene every morning and every night, because the toothbrush was shredding my dry gums. My son was using the compact brush head, which he complained &ldquo;feels like a jackhammer.&rdquo; I asked him how this one is, and he said, &ldquo;like a soft jackhammer. Better.&ldquo;The brush cleans as well as the others. Doesn&rsquo;t hurt my sensitive son. Doesn&rsquo;t tear my sensitive gums. I&rsquo;m keeping these on subscribe and save.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective-right-out-of-the-box">Defective right out of the box!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although it appears to be packaged in original Philips Sonicare packaging, I am afraid that the product may be a knock-off. I have been using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for at least 15 years. We have never gotten a defective replacement brush until we ordered this one. One of the brushes seems to work just fine, but the other just barely vibrates. I might as well be using an ordinary toothbrush. I compared the two brushes and the defective one seems to be missing a magnet at the bottom of the brackets that go inside the housing. I will not be buying any more of these from Amazon. I really am disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrible-product-from-this-manufacturer">Terrible product from this manufacturer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One bristle fell out with my first use. Another one the next day, another one the next day, etc. I haven&rsquo;t had this problem when I have bought the same product through Kohl&rsquo;s, so I don&rsquo;t know where these are coming from. Did the manufacturer start using a plant in another country? Next time, which should be very soon since bristles keep falling out, I will buy these from Kohl&rsquo;s or another local store so I can easily return them if they fall apart. I am too busy to figure out how to return them to amazon.</p>

<p>Garbage. One the magnets fell off after 1 week of use.</p>

<p>I love these!!! I hope someday they come out with a supersoft.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="note-these-are-replacement-heads-are-for-sensitive-teeth">Note: These are replacement heads are for sensitive teeth &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: These are replacement heads are for sensitive teeth. The bristles are softer than the standard heads.</p>
