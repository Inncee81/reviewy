</ul>

<p>The FlipBelt is a really simple but revolutionary product to go hands free. Made of machine-washable high tech Spandex-Lycra blend material with an internal pocket system accessible from four openings around the belts exterior.

Because there are no clasps or buttons, you simply pull the belt on like a pair of pants and wear it wherever it feels most comfortable. It doesn&rsquo;t move, jiggle, bounce or chafe and you could easily forget it&rsquo;s even there. A simple, elegant and fashionable solution to a problem for all active types, gym rats, runners, hikers, bikers, and travelers. Weighing a mere 3 ounces, the FlipBelt is so sleek you can even wear it to go out under your clothes without having to carry a wallet or purse.</p>

<h5 id="wrong-size-chart">Wrong size chart&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The size chart is wrong on the selection. I&rsquo;ve attached a photo so you can see what you really need. I&rsquo;ll have to return the one I ordered for a smaller one. the photo is the size chart that came with the belt.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value">Good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong> I guess I bought too tight of a size because it stretched.. so I ended up switching to using the single zip pocket belt from Nuclear as you can completely adjust it&hellip; Nuclear Strength Running and Fitness Workout Belt (Black)1. I ordered this and received it within the week (under 5 days), which I thought was great.2. The belt holds tight when worn outside of yoga pants (or jogging tights), but not so much if you wear it against your skin under your shirt.3. The pockets hold your phone well tight against you, although I can&rsquo;t fit my keys in any of them (with the fobs).4. Completely no bounce when running and/or jogging (but again haven&rsquo;t held key fobs in the pockets).5. I like that it&rsquo;s machine washable (I sweat a lot and it helps to not have that stink going on during class).</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-bounce-around-at-all">Doesn&rsquo;t Bounce Around At All!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently saw this product on after having searched for an iPhone running case. It wasn’t exactly what I was thinking at the time, but as it turns out, it’s even better! After I read more about it, I searched to see if they had their own website, which they did. I then looked around their website to see if they had opportunities to test or review their product, which they did. In exchange for providing me with a FlipBelt of my very own, I agreed to write this review for Level Terrain Apparel. Let me start out by saying that while I was provided with the complimentary FlipBelt, it has no bearing on how I feel about the product itself.I do not possess the standard “runner look.” I do not (and cannot) tuck clothes in. BIG runs in my family, it’s a genetic thing (thanks Mom and Dad). I’m an “up and down” dieter/runner who sometimes – or mostly - eats more than she runs. Therefore, the very last thing in the world I would want to wear while I’m out there running events with professional photographers taking action shots would be something gathering around my waist screaming “look here, look here”. Those waist packs, sport belts, athletic pouches or whatever you might call them - fanny bags – those are like swear words in my book. I would prefer to stick pins in my nice tech shirts rather than wear a simple bib holder for the mere fact that it cinches around that area.When this FlipBelt arrived, the first thing I noticed is that it looks just like the top of my favorite yoga pants – a nice, thick 3-inch band. It’s not a pouch that attaches to a belt; basically the whole thing IS a pouch. There are no zippers, buttons, buckles, nothing. You either put it over your head, or you step into it and adjust it to your waist or your hips, whichever is your preference. It has four little slits in it where you can insert your “stuff” to be carried. And according to the packaging the fabric is: “Wicking, Quick Dry Content: 92% Polyester and 8% Spandex.” I ordered black so that it would blend, but the belt does come in some fabulous colors such as yellow, aqua, pink, orange, green, blue, carbon, purple and maybe some day when I’m thin again, I’ll get the beautiful hot pink or aqua one….. maybe anyway. I ordered a Large, which, according to the package is for a women’s size 10-12, and it fit perfectly.Everything I read claimed that the belt didn’t bounce or move, and while this sounded fabulous, I just couldn’t believe it. Now that I’ve worn the product for a half marathon, let me be yet another person to tell you – THIS THING DOES NOT BOUNCE AND DOES NOT MOVE. You put it on, and that’s where it stays. For most of the event, it rained/drizzled/sprinkled, so the FlipBelt was damp. It doesn’t claim to be waterproof but my iPhone did stay dry, so I was happy with that. I actually talked to someone who has owned one for six months and she told me that the belt has not stretched out at all and is still as snug as mine is brand new. That’s a great piece of information to know because I did wonder how it would hold up.The photo on the left is a professional photo taken at half marathon. Note how the storage belt I was wearing helped make it look like I have a big ole &ldquo;beer gut&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s cinched around my waist so tight to keep it from bouncing around. You will never see that other storage belt on me again now since (1) I&rsquo;ve seen the photos from that event and (2) I now own the FlipBelt. The photo on the right is from the race last weekend and I know you have to agree how much better it looks! The best part about the FlipBelt for me is the fact that it does not bulk you up around the waist. I don’t even think you can see it, which makes me happy.</p>

<p>I was a little apprehensive to add any bulk to my midsection but this belt works great! It looks like a yoga pant waistband and is very comfortable. My waist is 30&rdquo; and my hip measurement (which is wear I wanted to wear it) was 38&rdquo;. I ordered the large (32-35&rdquo;). It fits perfectly and stays in place.</p>

<h5 id="adore-but-use-some-common-sense-yeah">Adore - but use some common sense, yeah?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of all the superlatives other reviewers have used to describe flip belt, I think there are some &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; worth mentioning, particularly if you&rsquo;re using it to run outside.I used the belt for the first time today (at a gym, on the treadmill) and stowed my ID and money as far into the seam that I could on the front of my left hip (actually where the keys are supposed to go - see the little hook in the picture). When I returned home and flipped the belt so the openings were facing outward, my cards and money were hovering a little too close to that opening. One reviewer gave the belt one star (maybe two, can&rsquo;t remember) because he/she lost their ID/cards/money on a long distance run - and I&rsquo;m guessing my experience was about to be similar. I&rsquo;d argue both instances involve a bit of user error.Larger items (i.e., a phone, keys) are going to withstand movement when the belt is flipped against your body. If you&rsquo;re not taking a jumble of keys, you may want to make sure to use the hook attached directly to the belt. Three of the pockets are comparatively shallower than the fourth, and are better suited for bulkier items (phone, keys, heck, even a small wallet). If you&rsquo;re ONLY putting a plastic card (e.g.,an ID or credit card) into the belt, there is a fourth pocket that&rsquo;s deeper than the other three that ends on the belt&rsquo;s seam. Put your cards THERE. If you&rsquo;re not going to put cards/money into any holder that will create friction, movement will cause those slippery plastic cards to move along the spandex material. Even better, make sure the pocket you insert them in rests somewhere on your front (put the logo on your back)- if they fall, they&rsquo;ll at least hit your leg. Or put your phone/keys to block them. Or&hellip;.I could go on. Just use common sense if you&rsquo;re putting valuables in this thing.Disclaimer - this may very well be a duplicate some other reviews. I can&rsquo;t claim complete originality - but I will definitely be running outdoors more with the hands free benefits of this thing. Worth every penny.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this for my wife. I went based off the review that someone else wrote regarding size. I bought a medium. Turns out I should&rsquo;ve bought a large. I&rsquo;m attaching a pic of the updated size chart that came with the belt (which matches the sizes offered when you place your order). Not sure if they will exchange my purchase.UPDATE: went ahead and reordered in Large. Fit my wife just right but turns out that the size chart on this belt was different than the one on the Medium belt I first ordered. Amazon should recheck all its inventory. Very confusing. Glad I don&rsquo;t have to make another return.</p>
