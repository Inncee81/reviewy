<h5 id="love-this-fan">love this fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this little fan that can clip right to my son&rsquo;s stroller. We bought this before a trip to Texas when my son was just 4 months old. I didn&rsquo;t want him to be too hot and sweaty in the stroller while we walked around the Alamo. We charged this with the included cord and it worked perfectly. While we stood in line, he had a constant flow of cool air. After a few months, I got it back out this weekend and charged it up again for a trip to the ball field. Still works and no complaints.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-just-about-perfect-for-using-at-the-gym">It&rsquo;s just about perfect for using at the gym</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this fan. I got it for taking to the gym. I easily overheat when running on the treadmill, and I need airflow on me when running. This fan is perfect. I clip it onto the display panel of the treadmill or one of the little compartments to hold your keys or whatever. It&rsquo;s adjustable and perfect. I can adjust it to blow right on my face or push it down a little and it will blow on my neck or torso. And you can adjust the speed of the fan as well. The only thing that went wrong with it is that the battery cover wouldn&rsquo;t easily come off when I tried to open it and it snapped off and broke, just as soon as I got it. I can use it without the battery cover, but would have preferred it if that hadn&rsquo;t happened at all. Oh well. It also would be nice if there was some type of battery indicator to see how much charge is left. One time I took it to the gym, the battery died shortly after I&rsquo;d started running and so it was useless that run. Now I have to be very careful to charge it before going to the gym because I can&rsquo;t tell how much power it has or how long the battery will last between uses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-rechargeable-fan">Nice rechargeable fan!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In my box the battery and cord was in a bag separate from the fan box, so be sure to look for it when the box arrives!!! But it is very convenient to have a rechargeable device so you don&rsquo;t have to keep worrying with batteries. Great size for clipping on if you work in an occasionally warm workplace, the gym, or taking along for the stroller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-little-fan">Love this little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan really does have a 360 radius, you can basically point it in whatever direction you want. This little thing has a good amount of power too! I charged it up all the way (ps I really like that it comes with a rechargeable battery, I hate buying batteries all the time) I ran it at full power for a little over 2 hours and then it died. It can run much longer when it is not on full power. We are going to Disneyworld with our little baby in a little bit so we plan on putting this little fan on the stroller to keep our little guy cool. We live in Florida and it gets really hot, we have also clipped it onto the carseat to keep our little man cool. So far it has worked really well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-powerful-and-quality">Very powerful and quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very surprised with this product, in a good way. I have had a few different fans over the years but the last one fell apart so I thought I would give this one a try. It arrived quickly and the packaging was great. The fan itself is constructed with quality materials and the spring was firm so no worries about it slipping or falling off. The power is a toggle that allows you to set it at any power level. It does have a very powerful motor as well. I stood 10 feet away and I was still able to feel the wind. I am very satisfied with this fan and highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-easy-to-use-and-i-love-the-pink">It is easy to use and i love the pink</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little fan has worked perfectly for my office job. I work right in from of a window, in Miami FL, and it can get really hot in the afternoon. This fan can charge on my computer, is strong, and can attach to cubicles, chairs, and even computer (though i would be more careful with this one, so you don&rsquo;t put to much pressure on the screen). It is easy to use and i love the pink!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-great-mini-fan">What a great mini fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace the clip on fan i had which was electric Well i have to say i was surprised this fan was pretty powerful better then the elecric fan i had before. i like that i can clip this on my wheelchair because i have multiple sclerosis and cant be hot, so this is perfect for keeping me cool. The clip is nice and strong, it will stay no problem where ever you clip this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-compact-fan">A great compact fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great compact fan! I love that it comes with a USB cord. It can be connected to a USB port for your computer or into a plug to run off of electricity. It also has a battery that can be charged. You can select from a variable speed for the fan. The fan will sit on a table top or it can be clipped onto another surface. The angle of the fan is adjustable.</p>
