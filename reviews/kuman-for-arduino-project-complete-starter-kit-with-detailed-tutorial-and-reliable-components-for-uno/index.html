<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="educational-and-exciting">Educational and Exciting!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great kit! Everything from the arduino clone to the sensors and RGB LED to test with, has been keeping myself and 2 son&rsquo;s busy playing and learning!In my attempt to keep my two son&rsquo;s (15 and 17) off of their cell phones, gaming consoles or girlfriends (oh yes, the struggle is real at this age) I wanted to grab their attention whilst trying to teach them some electronics theory and circuit design. So far it&rsquo;s been a hit and all 3 of us enjoy thinking about &lsquo;what we could do or make or.. or..&rsquo; which was exactly what my set goal was. Great packaging and an assortment of items will keep us learning into the future. We need to teach our kids these skills, as I was taught by my father, so they too can understand the general ideas around electronics. Our next venture will be with home automation and I&rsquo;m confident many of the items within this kit will be used.Thanks for a great bit of kit!</p>

<h5 id="the-good-ridiculously-fantastic-deal">The Good: Ridiculously fantastic deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Good: Ridiculously fantastic deal. The components that I have used (I&rsquo;d say about half of them) I&rsquo;ve had no issues with whatsoever. Complete newbie, knew nothing about programming (aside from half a course of Python) but I jumped right in. There&rsquo;s mountains of example code across the internet, for most things you probably won&rsquo;t have to write anything from scratch. The books that get emailed to you after a couple of days are <em>amazing</em> resources. Tons of sample code, good explanations, and each is hundreds and hundreds of pages.The bad: Some of the -quality- on some of the components feels cheap as if it&rsquo;s not designed to last. Things like jumpers and what have you don&rsquo;t make as good of a connection as I&rsquo;d prefer. The books and info about it took a few days, was happy when it came, but I was anxious to get started. Good luck ever getting everything back in the case ever again.Overall: Love it. Price point was freakin&rsquo; perfect. Will keep you busy for weeks, months, possibly years. Really does have everything you could want in a kit like this. Good for all skill levels. Rock on Kuman!</p>

<h5 id="great-starter-kit">Great starter kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit is a tremendous bargain. For just a little more than the cost of an Uno, you get a TON of stuff to hook up and experiment with. As other have noted, the documentation consists of a single piece of paper listing the contents of the kit. Beyond that, be prepared to do some Googling. It came this afternoon, and I&rsquo;ve already run through a bunch of example projects from the Arduino book I have. Right now I&rsquo;m messing around with the 8x8 bicolor led matrix. I see many hours of fun and learning ahead with this kit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tons-of-input-sensors-like-distance-measuring">tons of input sensors like distance measuring</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has absolutely everything you would possibly need for Arduino, tons of input sensors like distance measuring, flame &amp; temperature sensor, multiple 7-segment displays, stepper motor &amp; controller, real handy 5v/3.3v regulator switch, 2 breadboards, the actual Arduino, and a prototype shield. and everything else you need like jumper cables, resistors, switches &amp; buzzers. Lots of people complain there&rsquo;s no instructions&hellip;. obviously, this is electronic parts kit, not a tutorial kit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kit">Great kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very nice assortment of useful parts and sensors. It has enough variety to learn most of what can be done with the arduino and electronics in general. The box is nice too. It has the perfect shape to safely hold a couple of arduinos with assembled projects on their respective breadboard.My kit came with a slightly damaged proto shield and Kuman sent me a replacement right away. Great customer service!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loads-of-fun-in-a-small-package">loads of fun in a small package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this arduino starter kit to have some fun projects to use to introduce my young son to the things technology can do besides things like television, and to present some real-world applications of coding.This is a well assembled starter kit if you are interested in getting into arduino. The kit includes all parts to work through the included guide (on cd-rom), so if there is another &ldquo;course&rdquo; you are wanting to walk through, consider purchasing any other parts you might need for that one specifically (transistors, diodes, stepper motors, etc) in addition to what you find in this kit.You will find everything you need to get started here - arduino, expansion board, leds, jumper wires, an assortment of sensors, inputs, and outputs, led display boards, etc. It was nicely packaged - I&rsquo;m amazed they fit everything in so well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-starter-kit-arduino-uno-compatible">Highly Recommended Starter Kit (Arduino Uno Compatible)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is is a great Arduino starter kit. You can check out the components listed in the product description. I have tried most of the components and found them to be quality. Connections are easy, the pieces are solid, and there is plenty to play around with. It is time to get a few more pieces and parts so I can turn it into a sumo bot. (Can you say 3D printer?)The instructions are lacking a little, but that is the nature of Arduino in general, that said there are so many useful sites available for learning and this set is an Arduino Uno compatible kit. Arduino as language is very C/Java-like and easy enough to learn.My computer science kids have been loving it, and who knows, maybe we will incorporate this into our robotics club in the future. I highly recommend this as a starter kit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-kit">Love this kit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Took me about 5 minutes to setup the drivers for the clone board. I built a 3 led temperature sensor that lights up green if <80F red >80F and blue if the temperature is &lt;70. The tutorials list out every component and give sample code for each. This kit makes it easy to build small electronics projects. Im glad I purchased this kit and will buy components from this seller in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-hardware-really-poor-tutorial">Good hardware, really poor tutorial</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought the starter kit for learning about Arduino ahead of a child&rsquo;s science project. For the hardware components you get with kit, it looks like a good deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Loved the parts inside, now tinkering with these and trying to create new stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-beginners">Good for beginners!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything is awesome. The training manuals are excellent for someone who has never used Arduino.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hate-it">Hate it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey If you have Windows 10 forget your money.There is jungle of support. Nobody knows why it is not working on Windows 10 and what to do.Hate it.Janusz</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-for-kids-or-adults-that-are-inquisitive-and-want-to-learn-about-micro-electronics">Great value for kids or adults that are inquisitive and want to learn about micro electronics.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves this. Bought for him some time ago and he goes through the projects listed and is learning quite a bit. I would recommend this for ages 10 and up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My breadboard was faulty. Only about half of it is operational</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="truly-a-great-starter-kit-for-anyone-wanting-to-get-into-arduino-s">Truly a great starter kit for anyone wanting to get into Arduino&rsquo;s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The amount you receive in this Starter kit is amazing for the price. You can also build more than what they have in the guide once you figure out what all the components can&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-for-such-a-great-price-perfect-for-electrical-d-i-y-ers">Great quality for such a great price. Perfect for electrical d.i.y-ers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, my boyfriend was very surprised at the quality of this kit. I got this for him for Christmas and he started to build right away and QUICKLY got it up and running.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, has everything I needed to get up tp speed with arduino.It is a bit simplish, but it is a great stepping stone.</p>
