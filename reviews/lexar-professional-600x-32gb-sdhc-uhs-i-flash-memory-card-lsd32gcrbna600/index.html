<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="pathetic-write-speed-get-the-sandisk-extreme-pro-instead">Pathetic Write Speed. Get the SanDisk Extreme Pro Instead.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this card for use in my Nikon D810 and was very disappointed by it&rsquo;s performance. It’s advertised as a high speed Class 10 card with <em>READ</em> transfer speed up to 600x (90MB/s). That may be true for reads, but write speeds for this “600X” Lexar card are pathetic. After filling the camera’s buffer, it took close to two minutes (yes, minutes) to write the 18 raw images. Testing in the SD card slot on a late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina confirmed that the write speed is pathetic there as well, with write speed measuring less than 1/10th of the read speed (well under 10MB/s).This card might work for those looking for a high capacity card that is written to infrequently and read often, such as storing music/photo/video libraries, but I wouldn’t recommend using it in your camera. I returned my Lexar cards and purchased the SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB instead.The SanDisk Extreme Pro performs flawlessly in the D810, making it possible to capture several more frames before the buffer fills and emptying the buffer in seconds (~20s), rather than minutes, which the Lexar card required.</p>

<h5 id="card-stopped-working-within-45-days-frustrating-process-to-get-service">Card Stopped Working Within 45 Days - Frustrating Process to Get Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read a lot of the review on here and elsewhere before making this purchase. I was skeptical at first due to some of the negative comments and had a right to be. I bought the product to use with my Mac to save off files that I no longer needed on the machine.Within 45 days the card stopped working. I contacted customer support and went through a round of emails (5 of them) before they authorized a return. It was a frustrating process. I initially provided everything they asked for in the final email (including a copy of the receipt). They sent me the same questions in the 2nd and 4th emails and kept wanting to know what type camera I was using. The support people need to understand their products! I sent it for service and got a replacement back within 10 days.I&rsquo;m going to try this one again, but also backing up any additional files to an external drive. I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything critical on this disk based upon my experience and other reviews. I also wish that companies truly had warranty service and would try to repair/recover since you pay almost $175 for this item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-card-fast-and-reliable">Great card! Fast and Reliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast and reliable. Can&rsquo;t go wrong. I had been using 32GB SanDisk extreme, but the cards stopped reading on my 15&rdquo; MBP reader. I had to use an external ready to use the SanDisk cards. After doing some research on the web, I found multiple references to the SanDisk cards not playing well with Apple SD drives. I switched to Lexar and have had no problems. I still have the SanDisk cards and will only use them as a back up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lexar-why-did-you-disappoint-me">Lexar,&hellip;.why did you disappoint me ?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I trust Lexar. However, this card was corrupt. I formated it in camera, like I always do. I had to shoot a wedding. When I tried to transfer the images to the computer, the card&rsquo;s only option was to be formated, again&hellip;..with my images trapped inside. I had to transfer the images directly from camera to the computer through hardwire &amp; Canon&rsquo;s software. I testes a few other cards to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t the camera or computer and luckily it was neither. It was just this corrupt card. I was still angry that I could have lost the wedding photos but thankful for the software that comes with Canon so I didn&rsquo;t lose my images. Maybe Lexar isn&rsquo;t ready for 64GB.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pass-heading-back-to-pny">Pass, heading back to PNY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Won&rsquo;t Try this Brand again. I have a Canon T3i as my backup, portable camera. I took it with my 24mm EF-S lens as my point and shoot on a family vacation. I put this card, brand new in my camera before our trip. I came home and 2 or 3 of the pictures wouldn&rsquo;t read. Then, I used my camera the following week and two of the pictures had different colored bars across the bottom. I&rsquo;ve never had any issues with my camera or my old card (I just wanted a larger card), so I started by taking the memory card out and putting my old one back in. It worked just fine. It was a plain old PNY card, which I&rsquo;m going back to. I feel bad that I spent the extra money on this card. I&rsquo;m definitely also going to keep several smaller cards in the future, rather than ever going with a large card. The risk is too great if a card fails and all of your pictures are on one card.</p>

<h5 id="great-card-lexar-is-a-great-brand-that-i-have-trusted-for-a-long-time-without-issue">Great card. Lexar is a great brand that i have trusted for a long time without issue.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this card. Will probably purchase more of larger capacity. Now that SD is coming down in price i use it like film&hellip; fill up a card and get a new one. Still backup to harddrive too, but keep the SD cards as well. Benchmarked at around rated speeds, but it&rsquo;s been a while since i did it. Allows me to get 5 more frames in my 10fps burst mode than the class 10 transcend i was using before did, went from 32 to 37 frames&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-in-90-days-can-t-even-format-on-mac-pc-camera-videocamera">DEAD in 90 Days, Can&rsquo;t Even Format on Mac, PC, Camera, Videocamera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely horrible experience. My Amazon order list shows this was delivered on November 18, 2014. I actually did not start using it until about December 10 and before February 10, less than 3 months after using it, the card has become unusable taking my data with it. It will not even format on a camera, video camera, Mac, PC, or any other device. Stay away from this brand unless you want to bring on disaster to your data.[ADDED: Serves me right. I should have remembered not to buy this dog-p00p brand, because one year before this one I had bought the same company&rsquo;s 400X speed card which died too. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAEUUHMD4XTC?ref_=pe_620760_65501210">http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAEUUHMD4XTC?ref_=pe_620760_65501210</a> Avoid using these cards for any precious data. ]Imran</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this with my Canon EOS 6D years ago but I sold them both within weeks to get another 5DM3 and Lexar 128GB CF cards. Not much to say about the card.</p>
