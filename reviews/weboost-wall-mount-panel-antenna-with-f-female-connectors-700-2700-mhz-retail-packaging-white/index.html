<h5 id="great-wideband-antenna">Great Wideband antenna!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This antenna as been great. I have used to for both 2.4g Wifi and 800-900mhz cellular signal.Pointing it in the right direction I have gone from 1-2 bars of not so great 4g signal to a solid 3 bars of usable signal for devices sitting in the booster the antenna is connected to.I have also used this antenna to link up to other wireless routers at distances of 500+ meters. Based on signal strength at that range I imagine I can go much farther.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-weboost-directional-antenna-along-with-the-wilson-sleek-keeps">The weBoost directional antenna along with the Wilson sleek keeps &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The weBoost directional antenna along with the Wilson sleek keeps connected in the middle of no where and functions with my devices on all four carriers. I have traveled the west for a while now and have not been without cell signal yet while others drive into town to get theirs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="plain-and-simple-it-just-works">Plain and simple, it just works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We added this antenna to our 4g weboost connect. I was a bit concerned because we have 100ft of Coax going from the antenna to the weboost and another 100ft of coax going to each antenna after the wideband splitter which drops the signal -3db. This configuration pushes the limit of the coax loss to the max on a good day yet we still receive 3 bars of 4g which is enough to stream video. Before we had zero reception in our house. The antenna works extremely well. We have found that it is very directional. You need to be in about a 45 degree field in front of the antenna to get full reception. Also, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work well through walls. That being said, we were able to position the antenna to serve our needs. I highly recommend Wilson Electronics products if you struggle with phone reception. It has changed our lives</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-way-to-use-this-with-a-weboost-directional-antenna-without-modification">No way to use this with a WeBoost directional antenna without modification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was hoping that this would be an easy solution for installing a WeBoost directional antenna on the ladder of my motorhome. It required a lot of tinkering. First, there was no easy way to connect the antenna to it. I ended up turning it upside down and connecting the antenna to the aluminum Z-bracket. Then, I connected a 2-foot-long piece of 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; ID ABS pipe to the top of the RV ladder with two U-brackets.. The pipe part of the bracket shown in the illustration fits into the ABS pipe. I can rotate the antenna to face the closest cell tower. It works, but I think Wilson needs to do more work to figure out a better way to use their WeBoost with an RV. They provided suction cups to mount the WeBoost to a window, but quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t trust suction cups to hold an expensive piece of electronic equipment out in the weather.</p>

<p>Works in conjunction with WILSON outside antenna to supply 4G signal through out the 4000 sq ft rambler I live in that has a Metal roof! ave one antenna on one end of house where Laptop is and another on other end of house where TIVO is. Use Mobile WIFI from 4G phone to utilize both of these in &ldquo;rural area country house that does Not have Internet except for that stupid Satellite service . Get 72mps from the cell tower.. Bye BYE satellite..</p>

<h5 id="bad-item-description">Bad item description</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I am only gining this 3 stars is because the description is wrong &ndash; It came with a N Male connector so the adapter connector ordered with it was wrong. Be ware that the description is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-could-probably-fabricate-a-more-useful-antenna-mount-yourself-but-in-the-meantime-this-will-have-to-do">You could probably fabricate a more useful antenna mount yourself but in the meantime this will have to do.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this antenna &ldquo;pole&rdquo; to support the external component of the Wilson Cell Phone Signal booster. It consists of a U-bolt and clamp, a mounting bracket, and a short piece of pipe. You can see them in the picture. I would have like it better had the pipe been longer, say, four or five feet instead of the approximately 16 inches it is. This unit is not going to raise a cell phone signal antenna very far. What would have made me even happier would be for the external antenna to actually have a receptacle into which the &ldquo;pole&rdquo; could be fitted. I have yet to figure out how to affix the cell phone antenna to this unit and have it stay. Duct tape, maybe? The mounting bracket is constructed of aluminum. A heavier gauge aluminum or even steel would have been better material selections. And the bracket could have been longer, long enough to extend beyond the eave of the house.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-crazy-about-it">Not crazy about it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a remote mtn cabin in N. Ga. Before installing the repeater, we would get one, sometimes 2 dots on our Iphones. After installing I get 2 and 3 if I am right by the indoor broadcast antennae. That is not really what was promised. It is better, I am keeping the rather expensive piece of equipment, but it is certainly not what I had hoped, nor what was implied by the manufacturer (I don&rsquo;t believe they make any express promises nor gaurantees), or the product reviews. They themselves, when I called for some support said RG11 coax should be used, yet they package RG6 with the product. I might recommend someone else try one of the other manufacturers and see if they get a better result.</p>
