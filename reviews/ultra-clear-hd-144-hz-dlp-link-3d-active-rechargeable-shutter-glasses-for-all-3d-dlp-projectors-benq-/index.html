<p>Please Note for BenQ 3D Projectors only we recommend Adult DLP LINK eD Elite 144 Hz 3D Glasses (eDimensional Active Rechargeable) for All 3D DLP Projectors. As certain newer BenQ 3D Projectors are putting off too strong of a signal. You can still use the 3DHeaven version DLP Link 3D glasses if you put a piece of scotch tape across part of the receiver on the front of the 3DHeaven version DLP Link 3D glasses. Thanks for Looking!</p>

<h5 id="good-battery-life-and-comfortable">Good battery life and comfortable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased these and the Optoma branded RF glasses. I prefer these ones for the reasons below1. They don&rsquo;t need an RF transmitter.2. They&rsquo;re much cheaper.3. Picture quality is no different as far as I can tell after trying both pairs during same movie.4. My RF glasses require a charge after a handful of hours, (Not sure if that&rsquo;s normal or not) and these ones have been used for about 10 hours so far without needing a recharge.5. The build quality seem better. Not cheap plastic.6. These are more comfortable on my head/face. My Optoma branded glasses hurt my head above my ears and my nose after a half hour or so. (Everyone&rsquo;s heads are different so this is just my experience).I don&rsquo;t currently have any cons yet but if anything comes up, I&rsquo;ll update.</p>

<h5 id="simply-the-best-dlp-link-glasses-i-have-ever-used-even-when-compared-to-rf-models">Simply the best DLP Link glasses I have ever used even when compared to RF models.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased five pairs total for my Optoma DLP projector with Full DLP 3D. Also with the projector came two pairs of RF 3d Now glasses. Now I keep reading everyone say that RF is the way to go but I would have to disagree with all of them. These glasses provided the clearest and deepest image versus the RF. No ghosting was visible at all and images flowed onto the screen as the studio intended. I also can tell you I wear prescription glasses and these fit over the top of them with no issues and are very light weight and very comfortable. Out of all the brands I tested beyond these and the 3d Now I would highly recommend these over any other brand not only because of their intense perfect image but price that can not be beat. Also these have a nice feature where if they loose sync lets say if you walk out of the room to fill your popcorn bowl they sync immediately when the screen becomes visible again. These are definitely the best and you can not go wrong with these DLP Link glasses. I would advise everyone away from the RF emitter models as they are not worth the money in my opinion. I have very sensitive eyes and am very fussy with sound and image and can&rsquo;t say enough about them. Thanks for reading</p>

<h5 id="amazing-but-reliability-is-a-huge-concern">Amazing, but reliability is a HUGE concern</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wish I could give these a solid <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars, but simply can&rsquo;t due to one crippling factor&ndash;reliability. I ordered the four pack not even a month ago, and my home theater has seen maybe 4 uses total with these glasses at 1 hour max each session. Already, one of the glasses has malfunctioned&ndash;the right lens is no longer working properly. Keep in mind I am a musician with a home studio who babies electronics. Every item including the 3D glasses in my theater is also babied, to the point that these are stored in their microfiber pouches in a hard shell case.The effect is neat and these do provide a quality 3D image, but I&rsquo;m extremely weary after a pair failed so soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-for-the-price">Excellent for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first home 3D movie that I watched with these glasses was Avatar., on my BenQ 2050 projector. Worked great! The lenses completely covered both eyes. No blurring. Picture darkened a bit, but that&rsquo;s expected for a home system, but when you&rsquo;re into the movie, you don&rsquo;t think about it.Comes in a cute box, with a soft cloth bag, lens cleaning cloth and USB cable that you plug into your own power source.I&rsquo;ll be ordering a few more.</p>

<h5 id="benq-w1070-dlp-projector-starts-with-reverse-sync-would-love-to-learn-how-to-switch-sync-on-glasses-rather-than-on-display">BenQ W1070 DLP projector&ndash;starts with reverse sync&ndash;would love to learn how to switch sync on glasses (rather than on display)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i was excited to try these highly rated glasses. ordered them via prime and they actually indicated they would be delivered on business day 3 (1 extra day), and they arrived as promised.my problem is i use a benq w1070 DLP 3D projector. i had searched through the reviews what people had experienced with these glasses and the w1070. one unhelpful comment said to re-focus your projector. however, my problem has to do with these glasses being on a reverse sync with the projector/software and no way to easily fix it on the glasses (that i know of yet). so, for example, when we initially turn on the glasses, if there is an apple in the foreground and a snowy field in the background&ndash;it looks like the apple is embedded into a foreground of snow. very unsettling for whomever is using those glasses. usually with my other glasses (i own the incredisonic, and some Active Shutter Rechargeable 3D Glasses 144Hz for BenQ DLP-Link) you just click the power button and it will reverse the sync. But we couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to reverse the sync&ndash;the button would just power the glasses on/off. There was nothing in the attached documentation or online I could find. Nothing in Amazon questions/answers. I tried to ASK A QUESTION to the seller using my amazon order page, but the button was disabled (both in chrome and IE). So I couldn&rsquo;t ask the simple question of how to fix it. To cope if our family watched something, we&rsquo;d have to go into the PowerDVD software and switch the sync from left/right to right/left and that would fix it for our ultra-clear glasses, then all the other people watching would simply press their power buttons to switch syncs on their glasses. This was ultimately too much work&ndash;too much for the viewers and too much work to try to answer a simply product question.I tried to give it a fair shake, but at this point we&rsquo;re just going to switch to entirely Incredisonic Vue Actives&ndash;as they work perfectly, have less of a green tint (as these glasses seem to be not just slightly green, but a smidge darker&ndash;but really impercetible in comparison with brighter/darker), and have a button that allows each user to control the sync. At least these glasses are comfortable and shut out the dark&ndash;otherwise, for my frustrations, I&rsquo;d give it one star instead of two.If anyone knows a quicker button press or method to reverse the sync on the glasses easily, please do reply.Lastly, I wanted to include a lot of details, in case someone else has a w1070, but also to stave off those angry repliers on the one star reviews. It seems like this product attracts a lot of &ldquo;bro&rdquo; behavior on dissing people who give 1 star reviews as &ldquo;idiots.&rdquo; Well&ndash;every product/service in the world has the same mix of expert, average, and novice users&ndash;and anyone who reads reviews factors that into consideration. Sometimes it is a sign that the documentation/training could be a little bit more thorough for those who require it. It is a unique facet of this product that it attracts such vicious repliers to the 1 star reviews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really glad I purchased these glasses. I had to replace the pair that I originally bought when I got my 3D projector and to my surprise these glasses actually work better. Typically with my old pair I would have to increase the brightness of my display to compensate for the added darkness of the glasses but with these no adjustments need to be made. The only downside to these is there is no button to invert the lenses so sometimes I will have to do that through my projectors menu when activating 3D but that&rsquo;s not really a big deal. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with these and will buy again if ever needed.</p>
