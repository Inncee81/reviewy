<h5 id="this-is-perfect-for-side-sleepers-as-it-supports-your-head-perfectly">This is perfect for side sleepers as it supports your head perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is perfect for side sleepers as it supports your head perfectly. The memory foam is perfect in that it sinks in all the right places and supports your neck at the same time. I have severe TMJ pain and consequently have neck pain that makes it impossible to sleep, I&rsquo;m so grateful for this pillow and even with a newborn I&rsquo;m finally getting some decent sleep!This pillow is definitely an extra firm so if you&rsquo;re looking for a softer pillow do not get this one as I was skeptical after reading the reviews if it would be too firm (it isn&rsquo;t for me because I&rsquo;m not a back sleeper).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-an-absolutely-amazing-pillow-i-was-skeptical-at-first-because-it">This is an absolutely amazing pillow. I was skeptical at first because it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an absolutely amazing pillow. I was skeptical at first because it arrived flat as a pancake, but I followed the instructions and fluffed it up in the dryer with a handful of ice cubes. 15 minutes later it was like a completely different pillow! It&rsquo;s so fluffy and soft and provides great support if you&rsquo;re sitting up in bed. Conversely, it molds to your head as you sleep. It really is a great overall pillow and probably one of my favorite purchases I&rsquo;ve made this year. Investing in your sleep is so important and I&rsquo;m glad I did with this wonderful pillow!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fluffed-up-beautiful">Fluffed up beautiful-</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this pillow as a gift for myself .It arrived super flat , I fluffed it with my hands and let it rest for another 24 hours . It puffed up before the 24 hours were up . I tried it for a few nights but this is not the pillow for me . It was too firm and too big for my comfort. I gave it to my husband who is the opposite from me . It&rsquo;s never too firm or to big for him . He loves the pillow and claimed it as his . He sleeps great on it and has no complains about it at all . He is not a particular side or back sleeper .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="slept-better-with-this-pillow">Slept better with this pillow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that I slept better after using this pillow last night. Gave it plenty of time to expand after receiving it. Now matter what people write about seeing this pillow for the first time it still does not prepare you. Hard as heck to get out of the package, in fact had to carefully cut package open. Then I fluffed it and pulled at hard clumps that I could feel. Had my doubts about this pillow at first. gut it fluffed up beautifly and like I said I did sleep better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ended-up-buying-a-second-one">I ended up buying a second one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, these pillows are gigantic! I love it! It&rsquo;s like a body pillow that doesn&rsquo;t hog your whole side of the bed. They are so comfortable too, I tend to drag mine around like a security blanket because I like how it feels on my back when I&rsquo;m stuck on the couch for a day. I&rsquo;m trying my best not to go and buy two more, because I just don&rsquo;t need two more pillows. But I want two more of these! Our two pillows over lap each other from being so big!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-fluffy-and-wonderful">So fluffy and wonderful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love is almost an understatement. I like form pillows and I was scared when I got this in the mail completely flat. Within hours it was huge. I have to put part of a shoulder on it to get the right body position at night but it&rsquo;s so comfortable i am so happy I finally got a new pillow! Better than the bamboo one I had from Groupon before this one by far!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For me this pillow was too thick. I also was very frustrated with how crazy difficult it was to get out of the bag. I was about ready to send it back, but my husband tried it out and happily it has been very good for him. He doesnt wake up with pain in his neck every morning anymore. So it is a good pillow, it really just depends on the person.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-and-good-neck-support">Comfortable and good neck support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The pillow came flat, but after about 5 days it was fully expanded to the perfect size. I did not try putting it in the dryer to speed up this process. The pillow is really firm and thick, but your head sinks into the foam. I was using 2 pillows and now only use this one and my neck feels less stiff in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Supportive and retains shape very well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-sleep">Good sleep</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Most comfortable pillow. Fluffs just right</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="definitely-recommend-for-my-fellow-pillow-lovers">Definitely recommend for my fellow pillow lovers.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pillow is HUGE!!! And I LOVE it!! So soft and doesn’t lose its shape like my others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what">What!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sending these flat pillows back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="feels-amazing">Feels amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have honestly never slept better. Who knew what a huge difference the pillow you sleep with can make at night. So happy I found this pillow!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-pillow-is-amazing-super-soft-comfy">This pillow is amazing! Super soft &amp;’comfy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pillow is amazing! Super soft &amp;’comfy! My husband and I constantly fight over it each night so he will have to get his own sooner or later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-it">I like it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like to replace my pillow often and am always looking for a more comfortable/better one than I had previously. This one is nice!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-a-very-full-pillow-good-for-watching-tv-in-bed">It is a very full pillow good for watching tv in bed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A Very high quality product.It is a very full pillow good for watching tv in bed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-was-so-comfortable-it-did-take-some-time-to-start-breaking">it was so comfortable. It did take some time to start breaking &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pillow is huge! At first it was off-putting, but once it started to break in, it was so comfortable. It did take some time to start breaking in though!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-a-comfortable-buy-for-average-body-types">Not a comfortable buy for average body types</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pillow is far too thick resulting in straining your neck while you sleep. It barely fits into a king size pillow case.</p>
