<h5 id="fantastic-upgrade-from-the-old-model">Fantastic upgrade from the old model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a long time fan of the previous model, Remington SCC-100, and after reading the reviews of the HC4250 I was skeptical of the new design but I thought I would give the new model a try and I am very glad I did. The curve and the size of the blade are the same and the newer model feels lighter, is quieter, and I feel that it gives me a closer trim. I used the old model without a guard and if I wasn&rsquo;t careful it would knick my head but the newer model did not. I was able to use the newer model up and down or back and forth like the old one and I am hoping the newer battery style last longer than the previous did where I had to buy one every year or two (since 2010 I bought 4 of the previous model). If you are balding and want an easy quick way to trim your entire head then this is definitely the trimmer you need!July 2017 update. The trimmer is still working great, hands down big improvement over the old model. The battery holds a charge much longer then the old model. Several months before I need to charge it. I use the oil to keep it lubed and the unit still provides a close head shave with no nicks. I prefer the new configuration and it is very easy to hold for a quick head trim. I&rsquo;m so glad they updated the battery from the old type.</p>

<h5 id="and-2-like-to-keep-your-hair-short">and 2) like to keep your hair short</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who: 1) don&rsquo;t want to spend $20 every 2 weeks on a haircut; and 2) like to keep your hair short&hellip; this is a GREAT machine.I&rsquo;m 66, and although I used to keep my hair longer, I&rsquo;ve rejected the coiffed look in favor of neatness. Typically, I buzz my hair but don&rsquo;t want the chrome-dome look of a shaved head. And besides, I gave up shaving a long time ago. SO&hellip; since I like to look neat and professional, I was accustomed to waiting in a barber shop to fork out cash every couple of weeks. Then I started to look for alternatives.I found this shaver, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. It takes about 3 minutes to get my hair to the length I want (I use the 1.5 attachment) and clean out the shaver. It&rsquo;s so easy I do this a couple of times a week. And the shaver will pay for itself in 6 weeks.What more could I want?</p>

<h5 id="something-compact-and-easy-to-use">something compact and easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are in the military, this thing rocks! Finally, something compact and easy to use. Going cordless makes a world of difference. The wide contoured blades on this, is a real game changer. I had perfectly cut hair in less than two minutes. With my old clippers, I had to go over and over and still needed a second set of eyes, to find the stragglers.</p>

<h5 id="lifesaver-for-those-of-us-with-less-hair">Lifesaver for those of us with &hellip;less hair.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this item. I can&rsquo;t even begin to say how happy I am with this purchase - for $50 - I&rsquo;ve saved myself $15 haircuts for quite a long time - and this one is easier to use than any other clipper I&rsquo;ve seen. As seen below - cut this morning - it&rsquo;s so close and tight that the natural shine of my head from the lights appears.I&rsquo;m fully embracing the inevitable baldness - but I&rsquo;m too lazy to actually shave every day. This gives me a nice tight cut that I can do multiple times a week if needed - while taking a shower - in just a few minutes.Pros:- WATERPROOF. I can take it in the shower to cut my hair. That makes cleaning up and everything else so much easier than previous plug in clippers.- It&rsquo;s cordless. I no longer am tethered within 2 feet of the wall with my Wahl clippers. I can go anywhere. I can have lunch while cutting my hair. I can do it while driving. I could be at the beach! The possibilities are endless.- The shape is perfect. It fits right into my hand, and I can easily cut the hair all around my head without weird contortions.- Battery life is great. It works for multiple haircuts and I&rsquo;ve never had it come close to dying.- Very easily to clean. It takes about 15 seconds to clean, apply a bit of oil after dry, and good to go.Cons:- None.</p>

<h5 id="fast-daily-head-shaver-less-irritation-on-the-scalp">Fast, daily head shaver! Less irritation on the scalp!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this kit to replace a beard trimmer that I had been using to shave my hair down on my head every other day or so. The problem with the regular trimmer was the small blade, as well as the irritation from the trimmer on my scalp.This thing worked beautifully out of the box, even without a full charge on the battery. It has cut the time I spent shaving my head at least by half. It is especially easier to trim the back of my head, and get a nice smooth gradient of hair, rather than patches/untrimmed spots you might get with a smaller trimmer. Usually I can just go over a spot once instead of multiple times, which has cut down on the irritation I mentioned.The battery life also seems great on this little thing, although I typically have it plugged in while in use. I&rsquo;ve only really rinsed it once or twice with water, although it is supposedly water resistant/proof, I prefer to use the little brush it came with to clean the blades.Overall, this thing is excellent, and I would buy one again if I needed it. Hopefully the battery and blades last for a decent amount of time!</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-clipper">Fantastic clipper.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever since my time in the military I&rsquo;ve always shaved my head. Been through countless sets of trimmers and clippers. This is by far my favorite purchase. It&rsquo;s substantially smaller and fits in your hand like a baseball cut in half. The contour in perfect. Using a standard set of barber clippers on myself and shaving my head once every two weeks generally takes 20 minutes to get it perfect. Literally did my entire head in two minutes and it&rsquo;s flawless. The contour is awesome. Having the ability to rinse the clippers with the rinse port is going to make these last a very long time. So happy I paid the extra money and took a shot on these.</p>

<h5 id="couldn-t-be-happier">Couldn&rsquo;t be Happier</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. Great device. I&rsquo;ve been buzzing my own head for most of my life. Recently I began shaving my head bald but I really don&rsquo;t enjoy the knicks and razor burn from a straight razor. Was hoping this device would get me down close without the drawbacks. I used the 1.5MM guard (shortest provided) and it&rsquo;s as close as one could get without using a razor. I imagine I could go without the guard but history with buzzers tells me that the guard offers a better surface glide than without. I haven&rsquo;t used any of the other wide array of guards provided so I don&rsquo;t have any input to offer there but this device makes short work of keeping my head trimmed. Due to it&rsquo;s width and contour I was able to trim my head neatly in about 3 minutes. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>

<p>After using this clipper 5 times on 3 different people, I can say I am disappointed with them. Hair was constantly getting tugged.</p>

<p>Totally disappointed on amazon. I just opened mine which arrived in the mail a few hours ago. Seemed nice and clean, until I found human hairs in one of the clips.</p>
