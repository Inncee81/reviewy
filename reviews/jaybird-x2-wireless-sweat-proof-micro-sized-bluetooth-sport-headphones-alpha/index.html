<h5 id="use-over-the-ear-style-during-running-great-sound-for-bluetooth">Use over the ear style during running! Great Sound for bluetooth.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I never had the jaybird bluebuds x so I can&rsquo;t compare it to that.I purchased mine at bestbuy(to get a geeksquad warranty) about a few weeks ago and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. Jaybirds has a lifetime sweatproof warranty. Here is my 2 cents:Sound quality is great - As good as my $100 bose soundtrue earbuds(for a regular joe, it is more than enough). I use to watch movies on my mac and netflix on my roku and it sounds great.Noise cancelling is passive(enough to zone in but safe enough to hear surroundings while running).Battery life is as advertised - Ran for a week running 5-7 miles daily, watching movies without charging. Gets approximately 8 hours.Connectivity - No issues except for old bluetooth devices. Disconnected once but it was my old 2009 mac(so I bought a bluetooth dongle). Switching from one device to another is very easy. It can only get connected to one device.Fit - The smallest bluetooth earbuds money can buy in the market(I tried a lot ie backbeats go2, jabra sport, etc and they all look like I have a jawbreaker in my ear). The fit is great but when I ran it started to fall off with the sweat and all. The solution: Over the ear fitting. It has been excellent for me during running. I use the under the ear for leisure activities/plane trips because I can secure it around my neck when I temporarily remove them. Just google jaybirds on how to clip it properly(clips included in the purchase), it takes 30 seconds.Things I hate - the case. OMG. Very poorly designed. It is huge and a pain to open/close. The comply eartips has irritated my ears, so I use the silicone(included too).I disagree with other reviewers about not sounding loud enough, I never had a problem with it using spotify, pandora, itunes and even just watching from my mac. IT&rsquo;S ALL ABOUT THE PROPER FIT. Ignore the reviewers that says the sound is tiny, they are not fitting it correctly or they didn&rsquo;t clean their ears.TLDR: Just buy it if you&rsquo;re looking for a bluetooth earbud with good sound quality and comfortable fit. I spent too much time purchasing and returning the cheaper ones. Wear it over the ear when running. If the fit is not great, just return it but give it a shot :)UPDATE(10/24/2015): After 2 months of use, the X2 has been amazing. No lost connections(not even once!), plus the new iOS displays the battery life now. I have been training for a half marathon and using it for traveling, it has not failed me. Devices used: macbook pro late 2011, ipad air 2, tomtom spark cardio + music, iphone 6s.UPDATE(3/7/2016): The X2 has been solid. I have now been using it on a daily basis - I just discovered audiobooks lately and wear the X2 to listen to them on my way to work. Still no spotty bluetooth connections despite heavy use. I am using it for everything, I think I already got my money&rsquo;s worth. Battery life has not worsened after a few months.</p>

<h5 id="not-suited-to-small-ears">Not suited to small ears</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small eared people: you may be disappointed. For perspective, I am an adult female. And now I know I have small, flat ears (or these earbuds lead me to believe so)My Bose earbuds are much more comfortable. These are still a touch too big, and I cannot use the foam tips at all &ndash; it&rsquo;s uncomfortably painful in minutes.The ear wings don&rsquo;t reach my ears either. I put them on as directed in the video, but I cannot put the buds into my ears far enough for them to properly reach (even if I reach back and pull my ear up, as you would for foam hearing protection plugs).The silicone tips are slightly better than the foam ones, as they are thinner, but I don&rsquo;t think I could wear these for even a whole movie. I really would prefer that the bore was smaller, or tapered, or something. I&rsquo;ve had them out for several minutes and my ears still feel funny.The sound is good, especially for bluetooth headsets. It&rsquo;s not comparable to corded sets, but most people already realize this. Not too bassy, very balanced.</p>

<h5 id="one-of-the-better-workouts-i-ve-had-in-a-while-can-t-wait-to-run-again-tomorrow">One of the better workouts I&rsquo;ve had in a while! Can&rsquo;t wait to run again tomorrow&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE 2 months later on <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>: I spoke way too soon after writing up a review a day after receiving the product.Within a month of ownership it just stopped working. Jaybird paid for the shipping of replacement which took overall 3 weeks to get a new pair!Unfortunately, same exact issue happened again 1 month into ownership of the replacement! Requesting a refund DO NOT BUY!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Don&rsquo;t let 5 star averages fool you on other generic low-cost brands. With a little bit of research and experience in the online marketing field, I find that some of these businesses incentivize users offline with a discount on their product in exchange for &ldquo;honest&rdquo; reviews. Of course, with more high ratings and reviews come better rankings amongst competition in the marketplace. With more visibility obviously comes more sales. If you dig thoroughly into the reviews on some of the products you&rsquo;ll see customers leave a subtle disclaimer they&rsquo;ve been rewarded with a discount in exchange for a forced review. Pretty much extortion and it&rsquo;s not natural! I felt like I needed to let the world know so they don&rsquo;t get scammed into buying something that doesn&rsquo;t meet their expectations. Now that I&rsquo;ve got that off my chest, let&rsquo;s talk about this product - The Jaybird X2.First off, my first experience buying &ldquo;bluetooth&rdquo; behind the ear headphones was some groupon-type deal and those didn&rsquo;t last too long. So my initial impression on a wireless headset wasn&rsquo;t too great. What led me back to trying this route again was my go-to headphones with wires were no longer being sold. I wanted to make sure my next purchase would be a worthwhile investment.Upon receipt was impressed with the impeccable, sleek packaging. The entire experience opening it reminded me all too well about how Apple packages their merchandise. I felt inspired the second I pulled the product and parts out onto my desk. Loved how the product came charged so I could start working out right out the gate. It doesn&rsquo;t come with a physical manual but you can access a PDF and video tutorials from their website which is a smart way to save the trees and generate new traffic to their site.After finding the right size ear-tips and ear-fins (which by the way is a brilliant design) to help keep it secure in my ears, I was just about on my way. I found the cord to be a little long and irritating the bottom part of my neck when doing a test run. What&rsquo;s not talked up enough is their patented Cord Management Clips which helped tighten up the looseness. The volume and power button on the side is within reach and easy to learn. It found and connected to my iPhone 5 with no problems. Got it to fit perfectly and comfortably.Just got back from a nice 3mi. plus run and was a great experience! I recommend it if you&rsquo;re willing to pay a little bit more than some alternatives.</p>
