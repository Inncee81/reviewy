<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="love-these-brushes">Love these brushes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, I read and re-read all of these reviews on here and hesitantly pulled the trigger. I have nothing to complain about these toothbrushes. They are &ldquo;loud&rdquo; but not ear-splittingly. My husband and I decided we would use them at night so we don&rsquo;t wake each other up with them (we don&rsquo;t have a door into our master bathroom).As for the complaints about scum/black stuff build up under the brush head, of COURSE that is going to happen if you let moisture and mouth germs just sit in there! That would be true for pretty much any toothbrush like this. If mine gets water under the head I remove the head and allow the whole thing to air dry. I just have a folded up washcloth I lay it on. It&rsquo;s a small price to pay for the cleanest teeth I have ever had! If you think about the design (and I am an engineer so I always do when looking at a product) there is not a better way to make these brushes ergonomic, functional, etc.The brush heads that come with it are not identical, for those of you like me researching and wondering how often you will use your spouse&rsquo;s tooth brush. One has a dot and one has a square. They are small identifiers. And they are on the brush heads, so you will still have that issue once you change the brush heads that unless you can always find yourself packs with dots and squares and use the same one.BUT the biggest thing is how CLEAN my teeth feel! I love this brush! And hopefully I am not doing so much damage brushing so hard! I was starting to recede my own gums. I love this and would recommend it to anyone who asked! Maybe even someone who didn&rsquo;t ask! LOL!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was wanting: two no-frills, standard sonicare toothbrushes. There is only one speed setting on these toothbrushes. But, in my opinion, that is all they really need. The package also comes with 2 extra diamondclean brush heads. With the diamond clean heads, it will remove up to 7x more plaque than a standard toothbrush. So, this cheapo model will get your teeth just as clean as the most expensive sonicare. The more expensive sonicares just have more, unnecessary, speed settings, and the most expensive have a fancy inductive charger, that doesn&rsquo;t work any better and is not any more convenient than the charger on this item&hellip;it just looks cooler. Save your money and buy this one!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-think-you-ll-be-disappointed-it-works-and-all-but-doesn-t-feel-as">I think you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. It works and all but doesn&rsquo;t feel as &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using the Elite and switch to this one, I think you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. It works and all but doesn&rsquo;t feel as solid or powerful as the Elite. Also, the head rattles loudly. Almost like something is loose. It&rsquo;s like that on both brushed no matter what head you use. And, if you put any kind of pressure on the head, there is a drastic loss of vibration. I got these to replace our Elites and give the old ones too my kids. After using the new ones for a week, I&rsquo;ll be switching back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wonderful-bargain-and-teeth-feel-much-cleaner">Wonderful Bargain and Teeth Feel Much Cleaner!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Sonicare Plaque Control Plus Twin Pack replaced our 10-year-old Sonicare Essence. Love that this one has two handles and two chargers!! It seems to be a TINY bit noisier than the old Essence BUT &ndash; my teeth and gums feel very much cleaner and healthier. So, small trade off there, in my opinion. We&rsquo;ve had this set up about a month now and both of us are very happy with it. Great product at a great price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-deal-on-two-great-philips-sonicare-toothbrushes-don-t-hesitate">Good deal on TWO great Philips Sonicare toothbrushes - don&rsquo;t hesitate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Package was completely sealed and was the original packaging, a shiny brand new box. Everything was as described and all the proper instructions and warranty booklets were included. Both toothbrushes charged properly, took almost 24 hours so if you get one, charge until the light stops flashing. This was a great deal! Had a Philips Sonicare years ago, then switched to a cheaper off brand. It was just OK. Didn&rsquo;t get a new Philips because the price is so high and there are two of us so it&rsquo;s not practical to buy two and really wanted just the basics, not all the attachments and variable speeds. This one solved those problems. The chargers/holders are so small and won&rsquo;t take up much room on the counter. Since I know how great Philip Sonicare is for your teeth and gums, I am sure we will have no problems with the brushes. Very satisfied. Will update as needed. If you need two brushes, don&rsquo;t wait, this is a great deal!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-amazing-how-clean-your-teeth-feel-after-using-it-and">It&rsquo;s amazing how clean your teeth feel after using it and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I made the switch to Sonicare and now I will never go back to brushing my teeth with regular toothbrushes again. I&rsquo;ve always had sensitive teeth but ever since I have started using this, I no longer have that tooth sensitivity. It&rsquo;s amazing how clean your teeth feel after using it and I actually love having the timer on it so I can know how long I&rsquo;ve been brushing for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-for-dental-hygiene">Great product for dental hygiene</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After the initial &ldquo;shock to the mouth&rdquo; period I have to say I love this device! (It operates for 2 weeks on a lower power to get you used to it.) My teeth and mouth have never felt so clean and my dentist is a fan as well. The 2 minute timer with the 30 second intervals keeps you on track and the nearly water proof package makes it okay to use in the shower if so desired. (I don&rsquo;t drench it because I don&rsquo;t know if it really is 100% waterproof.) The only complaint I have is that the charger base is really light weight and the power cord is somewhat stiff so you have to be careful how you set it up for charging so that it doesn&rsquo;t tip over. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ve been totally pleased with the purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-does-improve-brushing-your-teeth">Really does improve brushing your teeth.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been using sonic care, my dentist has commented on how much better my mouth looks. I get a better cleaning and less effort while brushing. Just press and glide the brush on your teeth while it vibrates. If the vibrating hurts your teeth then I would go to the dentist and get a professional cleaning and then use the brush. I also pay more attention to my teeth and their maintenance. It really does help with cleaning your teeth. This does not mean you stop flossing or going to the dentist. It improves teeth cleaning but it is not the &ldquo; fix all&rdquo; to teeth cleaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-1">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Replaced our old model with this one, love it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended">Recommended.</h5>

<p>Better than the older narrow body model. Better fit to hand and seems to simply clean better. Old one was worn out. Very satisfied.</p>
