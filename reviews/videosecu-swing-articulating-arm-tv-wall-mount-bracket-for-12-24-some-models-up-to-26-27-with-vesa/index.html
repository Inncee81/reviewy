<h5 id="nice-low-profile-mount-for-a-19-lcd-but-sags-over-time-and-requires-periodic-tightening">Nice, low-profile mount for a 19&rdquo; LCD, but sags over time and requires periodic tightening.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does what it needs to, though I did not choose to use the included mounting hardware (for the to-wall portion, not the VESA mount to the monitor) as it was pretty cheap, and did not need my monitor busting off of the wall! (minus 1 star).Another thing to note is that, every time I reposition my monitor, the main hinge (at the wall mount part of the arm) slightly loosens until every couple of months I need to re-tighten it because it sags (this is on a fairly lightweight 19&rdquo; Dell LCD) down and cramps my computing style. Save the allen wrench it comes with&hellip; you will probably need it for routine tightening. (minus 1 star).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-support-imac-incorrect-information-provided">Does not support iMac. Incorrect information provided.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this part thinking that it would definitely be able to hold my 27 inch iMac up, as it specifically states &ldquo;up to 27 inches&rdquo; and a 33lb capacity. Great! Especially, when you consider that my iMac is 27 inches and comes in at 30lbs. Should be pushing toward the limit, but within spec.Definitely not. The part that holds the iMac and swivels in an up or down titled position is unable to hold the weight. It just simply hangs down and the screen points toward the floor. No matter how hard you tighten the allen bolts, it will still slide down. I even took the washers off to get it closer to the metal and screwed it back in, same thing.I called VideoSecu for support and they said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tested for 33lbs, but we don&rsquo;t recommend anywhere over 25lbs as it will swing out of position.&rdquo; &ndash; I asked them if they thought maybe they should update their product info then, if it&rsquo;s unable to support over 25lbs correctly, to which they answered, they tested it and it should be able to hold 33lbs.Maybe they tested whether or not the arm itself can hold a 33lb object, but not whether or not it can sustain a 25lb+ object without tilting the screen? Terrible.</p>

<h5 id="using-it-with-a-26-led-hdtv-works-great">Using it with a 26&rdquo; LED HDTV..works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using this mount with a Vizio 26&rdquo; LED TV. My TV weighs 13 lbs but this mount can handle more weight. I have a few other LCD mounts and what I like about this is it is properly sized for lighter, LED TV&rsquo;s. I originally purchased a heavier mount used for 26-37&rdquo; TV&rsquo;s thinking I needed something more substantial. That mount was heavy duty&hellip;overkill for a thin light TV. I ended up not using that mount and getting this one for less money.Mount is silver and seems to be of good quality for the price.Install was very quick as its only two screws. Just figure out where you want the center of TV screen and put the center of the square piece (where the TV connects to the mount) in that spot. Mark the top screw hole, use your level on the side and mark the bottom screw. I didn&rsquo;t go into studs (used wall anchors) since the studs did line up right around the dresser. Honestly with the TV only 13 lbs, this thing is not going anywhere unless someone hangs on it.Four screws into the back of the TV. If the TV is not level, you can loosen the four screws and there is a little play moving the TV in the bracket. Line up the TV and then tighten the top two screws. Recheck and if ok, tighten the bottom two.I have had the TV up for a few weeks and have not noticed any sagging. It comes with an Allen wrench to tighten the pivots which I taped to the back of the TV out of sight. We primarily only rotate it left and right but pull the TV out a bit occasionally.You might want to put a small hand towel or attach pieces of rubber to the back of the bracket that might touch your wall when you push the TV back in toward the wall. That will prevent marks.</p>

<h5 id="does-the-job-at-an-affordable-price">Does the job at an affordable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Feels durable and strong. Easy mounting. Included everything needed but the drill and screwdriver.Hinged joints are really tight and hard to move unless you loosen the nut a bit. Easy to do with the included bite sized wrench.Rotating TV mount made it easy to orient my TV portrait.The main con is the nut to tighten the TV bracket to keep the display from rotating is impossible to tighten. Well, nearly impossible but definitely frustrating. So 4 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-value-but-not-necessarily-a-good-purchase">A good value, but not necessarily a good purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, let me say that the title of this review is not the giant contradiction that it appears to be. Because as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, a sub-$20 articulating wall mount merely needs to keep a TV aloft (without collapsing) to represent fairly good value for money. However, simply being functional does not a good product make.In the case of this product, you more or less get what you pay for I suppose. Installation is fairly straightforward and, as mentioned above, it does keep my 20 lb., 24&rdquo; Sony Google TV aloft without straining. But that&rsquo;s it for the positives. The negatives are twofold &ndash; one fairly trivial and one entirely headache inducing.First, The installation screws which come with the unit are noticeably cheap. Specifically, the steel which they are made of is rather soft, so there&rsquo;s a risk that you&rsquo;ll wear away the entire Philips head when driving each screw into the wall. I managed to do just that with the second one and had to replace it with a similar screw from my tool box. Not a big deal, but it could be a bit of a hassle if you don&rsquo;t happen to have any suitable screws on hand and are forced to run out to a hardware store.Second &ndash; and far more important &ndash; the vertical tilt mechanism that holds the TV in its desired position is very poorly designed. The mechanism essentially consists of 2 Allen screws that reside on either side of the joint which connects the articulating arm to the TV mounting plate. To change the position, you loosen the screws and to fix the position you tighten them. Well, at least in theory. In reality, however, the screws simply don&rsquo;t want to stay tightened. So you repeatedly find yourself performing an awkward little dance in which you hold the TV in its desired position with one hand while going back and forth, side to side, re-tightening the screws with the other. This is especially true if, like me, you actually wish to change the position of the TV from time to time &ndash; one the central features of an articulating mount. Because simply touching the TV causes the screws to loosen. All in all, it&rsquo;s a nuisance.That said, it&rsquo;s a cheap mount. And as a cheap mount, I feel it would be unfair to expect expensive mount performance. So I&rsquo;ve only knocked it down one star. Thsi product does the job; it just doesn&rsquo;t do it that well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay for the price. The design has a flaw that the bolt stays in the way of mounting plate hole which prevent the socket to tighten the screw.</p>
