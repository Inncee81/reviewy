<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="cool-drone-terrible-customer-service">cool drone, terrible customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool drone, but now likely outdated technology and too expensive. Very poor customer service sabotages any other positive part of the ownership experience.I bought this back in June and had a few flights with it. Eventually I needed new/spare landing gear which isn&rsquo;t very surprising, but it&rsquo;s been four months since I ordered my landing gear direct from AirDog. I still have had no landing gear shipped to me despite numerous contacts with AirDog customer service.Effectively, I don&rsquo;t own a drone so much as a $1600 paperweight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea-poor-execution-v-1">Great Idea poor execution V.1.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product itself is ok, but due to the continuing recalibration needed it&rsquo;s pretty useless in real world applications. Took it to canada to film a cat ski trip and was not able to get any footage due to the need to go through a calibration process every single run. Often that calibration process would never complete. If folks are paying $9k a day to ski they don&rsquo;t want to waste half an hour every time they want to film. Wait for a later version of the product or look elsewhere. Not my first drone - but my last with Airdog until this is cleaned up.</p>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<p>Battery that came with the airdog was defective right out of the box as was the extra one else I ordered, very disappointed!</p>

<p>Airdog &hellip;isnt the way to go&hellip;! No support, and defective batteries..! Any other&hellip;.will do better, for that price..! Its Latvia..</p>

<h5 id="caused-embarrassing-scene">Caused embarrassing scene&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not much of a out and about guy for 26 so when I had two very hot girls come up to me to check this man toy out I was fairly excited needless to say.I was showing one of them basically from behind, contact and all, it was awesome.Then she almost whacked a tree trunk so I took control, everything was fine, had it coming back to us at 8 miles an hour, as I was watching it closer to us my link broke and no longer was in control, as I was messing around trying to get a connection, I looked up and this damn thing kept coming and bashed me in the mouth, knocking out my front crown (hockey accident) and it lands on the short ones lap she was sitting.They both sympathized and then left, hands down the most &ldquo;can&rsquo;t make this stuff up&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve ever experienced</p>

<h5 id="amazing-auto-follow-with-dual-gps-for-no-guess-tracking">Amazing auto-follow with dual GPS for no guess tracking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this drone to help me shoot my Kitesurfing action, although they don&rsquo;t have yet a dedicated mode for that. the Windsurf one does just fine. I did have issues with the battery, arrived DOA. I wrote to customer support, Eldars in particular was SUPER nice and responsive. They asked me to send a video with the battery not charging and dispatched me at no cost a new battery via DHL. As I found later, prior to the battery patch they put out few weeks ago, the smart battery would continue to self discharge while stored. That led to LiPOs getting below the recovery level and bricking them. The new battery I tested is perfect. It will self discharge down to 3.8V per cell for safe storage, that&rsquo;s about 60% and it stays there. As for flying, the Airdog is impressive, just read read read the manuals, it&rsquo;s not your average drone. The autonomous flight part needs understanding from you so as you run downhill you won&rsquo;t push the drone into the trees ahead of you. You need to understand that, the drone does an AMAZING job at repositioning and keeping you in the center of your footage. the Gimbal is decent, not super high end but decent. During re-positioning for example the drone will fly from the back to front and during this, since the gimbal doesn&rsquo;t move left-right axis but only on 2 axes, you might have some jitter. I think other drones have similar issues w/o a true 3 axes gimbal. Out of the rest of the drones, the fact it packs down and you can put it in your backpack is a REAL nice thing. I considered the cheaper $1000 auto-fllow drones that rely on video to identify you in the picture and follow. they do NOT work at all, losing tracking on the subject while you go downhill or on the water flying a kite and seeing the drone hovering and not reconnecting to you sucks. So AirDog was really attached to the leash it followed so to speak. Dual GPS in the drone and leash makes this coordination super nice.</p>

<h5 id="kickstarter-backer-here-it-was-worth-the-wait">Kickstarter Backer here. It was worth the wait.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The airdog is exactly what I expected. Having purchased it during the Kickstarter campaign made it an even better deal.The biggest issue I have is the battery time. It only lasts about 15 mins. You really have to prepare ahead. Place the drone closer to the action and be ready to start as soon as it gets in place. I plan to get some replacement batteries but they are expensive because they are not a standard LiPo battery.On the other hand the Airdog has a lot of positives. All of the parts that experience the most wear and tear can be replaced. The battery is quick and easy to swap. The body is sturdy AF and will survive a beating however it is not waterproof.</p>

<p>Could not be more impressed with this product. Excellent control and ease of use. Once you realise how the propellers go on properly. Support from tech team was excellent too.</p>

<h5 id="nothing-good">Nothing good&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not worth it.. hardly any features, features they say they have don&rsquo;t work very well. For 1600 you don&rsquo;t even get a camera. Poor flight time.</p>
