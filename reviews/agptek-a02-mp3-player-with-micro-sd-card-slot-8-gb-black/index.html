<h5 id="awesome-little-mp3-player">Awesome little MP3 player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So my iPod Classic 160GB finally bit the dust and I&rsquo;m looking for a player to hold a least 90 GB and thinking that there would be a plethora of them available and cheep! Wrong. Well I decided to get this APGtEk for $21.99. Can&rsquo;t go wrong right? I have a scan disk 64 GB card I thought I&rsquo;d try it out, going against the manufacturers warnings about compatibility issues. Well it worked fine. I&rsquo;ve transferred just over 4000 songs onto the card and I&rsquo;m super happy about that. I actually got rid of some stuff I didn&rsquo;t need or want anyway. The volume is a little lower than I would like. Car and gym playback is great but when mowing grass I&rsquo;d like a little extra bump in volume. The navigation is a little weird but I&rsquo;ve only had it for a day. I&rsquo;ll get used to it. I will never figure out why there is an eBook folder. Silly with such a small screen. But I do love the size of this. Much lighter than the iPod. I have the armband made for this and I barely know its there. Sound quality is good. I really can&rsquo;t tell any difference between the iPod and this one. All the album art didn&rsquo;t transfer but I finally figured out to use Media Monkey. Still working on that but having fun with it.</p>

<h5 id="may-give-it-one-more-try-needs-to-be-further-improvement">May give it one more try, needs to be further improvement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 2015 version back in July of 2015 and it lasted for 8 or so months, but the battery slowly deteriorated over this time. I kinda neglected the on and off switch most of the time, but the company doesn&rsquo;t seem to mention much that simply powering it off with the center button won&rsquo;t stop battery drain.I ordered my new 2016 model in late April, and unfortunately it was never correctly delivered to me by the USPS. This is no fault of Amazon or the seller. USPS has a reputation for being lackluster in package delivery.This leads me to my now THIRD AGPteK player. The previous one was fully refunded by Amazon and they were awesome enough to give me free one day shipping on my new A02.The player lasted two weeks roughly before the screen went white. I could hear my music but couldn&rsquo;t navigate the menus. Further, the MP3 player wouldn&rsquo;t power on unless plugged into USB. 2 or so weeks and the thing bricks on me. Come on AGPtek!Here&rsquo;s my list of needed improvements for this to be a solid player, which it falls short of, sadly:1. Better build quality: This is a paper light MP3 device. As such, it seems as the technology is crammed into a small and flimsy place and because of this, it is prone to far more wear. I think this is part of the reason mine white screened after two weeks. MP3&rsquo;s should be something you can slide in a pocket and know it will be safe. That is not the case exactly with this player. Also, the rubber coating can wear off quickly on these players2. Organized files by ID3 tag: As others mention, this player organizes everything alphabetically. This means that under &ldquo;From Ashes To New&rdquo; you will get &ldquo;Shadows&rdquo; as the first track under the &ldquo;Day One&rdquo; album. The correct first track is &ldquo;Land of Make Believe&rdquo;. The only way to slightly adjust for this is to name the actual track &ldquo;01 Land of Make Believe&rdquo;, If you&rsquo;re like me and have a collection, you will have several songs under &ldquo;All artists&rdquo; competing for the number one spot on your personal billboard. Really annoying! AGPteK says to go into folder mode, but this is not convenient because I like to shuffle all my songs while I&rsquo;m driving. You cannot shuffle all songs in folder mode. This mistake has been pointed out and there&rsquo;s no reason the company cannot fix this.3. True &ldquo;Expandable&rdquo; Memory: I never have had this problem, because I&rsquo;ve never filled the player up fully, but apparently there is a 4,000 song limit. IDK if this is total between MicroSD and player or overall, but if you&rsquo;re gonna sell a device that is capable of up to 32 or more GB of music, at least make it function correctly!This is probably your best bet for an MP3 for extended battery life and storage capacity, but it falls short of greatness because of it&rsquo;s vulnerable hardware and few software issues. If AGPtek takes reviews like this into serious consideration, they can bring the dying MP3 market back to life with a device that costs a fraction of an Ipod with plenty of features. I am not a video-on-the-go type of person, so those things dont matter to me, but don&rsquo;t look here for videos, photos, etc.If one more MP3 player fails on me, I will upgrade to a smartphone and leave the MP3 market behind. I really don&rsquo;t want to, as I like having separate devices, but my luck with Amazon MP3 players is running out. Budget MP3 players, might I add.Take my review with a grain of salt and remember. You get what you pay for!</p>

<h5 id="has-good-sound-quality">has good sound quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s compact, has good sound quality, and so far the battery is performing well. I have been using it about a month and have recharged once.At first I found the instructions a little confusing, but have since figured it out. I find it&rsquo;s best for me to leave it on, press the center button twice while playing. The first time is to pause the player, then hold the center button 2 or 3 seconds and release to get back to the &ldquo;home&rdquo; screen.Then hold the center button again, and it will flash 1 - 2 -3 , and go into sleep mode.The next time you want to use it, tap the center button, and it will start up where you left off.Reasonably priced too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously, for the price and 8Gb of space, you can&rsquo;t beat this player. I bought this for my boyfriend who lost his ipod while serving overseas. I wanted to get him something to replace it, but didn&rsquo;t want to spend $200+ on the name brand. Anyone who has ever shipped care packages to their military loved ones will know not to send expensive items. I loaded this up with 4Gb of music and several photos as a surprise and he has used it every day for the past 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months without fail! He loves it!</p>

<h5 id="best-little-gadget-for-multiple-uses">Best Little gadget for Multiple uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a versatile little device, mp3, video, radio, mic record and ebook. I tried the ebook by inserting a text file and I could read it pretty well. I think it&rsquo;s 26 letters / digits horizontal. I haven&rsquo;t been able to test video because conversion is required, and use of direct show filter, which I thought my conversion program had.The only con is battery is a bit finicky, but acceptable.I had got this for ebook and video AND because it&rsquo;s not wifi. Some people like to irradiate themselves but not me, and I&rsquo;m glad AGPtEK made a device for those who prefer wired systems. The combination of ebook, music, and mic I imagine would be very helpful to students. I&rsquo;m very satisfied with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-music-player">Good music player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this music player. It is very well made and is very durable. It works well using the micro sd card to expand its storage. I also have the AGPTEK Imp player. I like both for the different features they have but I think the set and forget player that I like best is the Imp. It is a little easier to set up for continuous play if you are working and just want continuous music playing in the background. Otherwise I like them both. The sound quality is excellent.</p>

<h5 id="this-product-is-poop-the-menus-are-hard-to">This product is poop! The menus are hard to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is poop! The menus are hard to read and navigate. Then when you place the unit in the sport band it is almost impossible to adjust anything. You have to take it out of band adjust it then place it back in the band. After a week, the front screen just froze up. I sent it back and I will never buy from this company again.</p>
