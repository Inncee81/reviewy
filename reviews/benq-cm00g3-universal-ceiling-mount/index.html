<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="solid-mount-works-with-benq-w1070">Solid mount, works with Benq W1070</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this with my BenQ w1070. This is my first projector and first experience mounting a projector to the ceiling. Item appears as pictured. It took a little under an hour to install with the help of a friend. Most of that time was spent double checking measurements and assembling the mounting plate and arms. The instructions are not terribly clear and detailed as to what bolt, screw, etc goes where and the illustrations are difficult to make out. The text of the instructions are insanely tiny making it difficult to read. It comes with screws to assemble and attach to ceiling.Mount comes with a telescoping extension that you can use. Or you can just attach the projector directly to the mounting plate. Without the extension, I got about 4 to 5 inch clearance from the ceiling, which suited my purposes just fine. I have a little under 8ft ceilings in the man cave. Using the extension would have the projector hanging too low from the ceiling and would risk having people bump their heads against it.Other reviewers have complained that the w1070 only has 3 attachment points while this mount has 4 arms. I&rsquo;m not sure if mine is a newer redesigned model, but I rectified the situation by only using the attachment arms when assembling the mount and left the unused one in the box. I had to arrange the arms into a triangle of sorts to attach it to the projector and it seems to work.The mount has a ball joint allowing a great deal of adjustment. There is a locking mechanism that keeps the position in place. However unlocked the joint moves very loosely so making fine adjustments will be difficult. I found that if i partially engaged the lock, it minimized the play in the joint and allowed me to make finer adjustments. It would be nice if you could adjust pitch, roll, yaw of the mount individually, but this mount has no way to do this. Invariably when you adjust one, you may effect another. So fine tuning position may take some time.</p>

<h5 id="height-settings-not-as-flexible-as-described-extends-5-inches-or-14-22-7-inches">Height settings not as flexible as described - Extends 5 inches or 14-22.7 inches</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It probably works fine. Except the drop isn&rsquo;t flexible enough. The description says it extends 5-22.7 inches. This isn&rsquo;t exactly correct. It extends 5 inches or 14-22.7 inches. I needed one that was 8-9 inches, so I quickly discovered that this wasn&rsquo;t going to work for me and had to return it.I went with a Vantage Point CGUPM12-S, which provides the ultimate in flexibility (although probably more time-consuming to adjust).It did seem that it was made well, and I would have kept it had it worked for my application.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-ok">its ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>what would make this perfect would be able to move swing it right or left. also I uses different screws. the location I put it up had 2 screws in wood and 2 not in wood. I had to use 2 (3.5&rdquo;) screws for wood. I didn&rsquo;t feel like the screws that came would be able to screw in as good. when I used the (3.5&rdquo;) it was soled. I even tried to hang from it and it took my weight. I&rsquo;m 180 pounds not to heavy but it&rsquo;s holding way less so I felt it was going to hold. with the screws it came with I felt it was not going to hold the projector. other then those two things it&rsquo;s ok. 4 stars</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bought-it-twice">Bought it twice!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love this projector mount, it gives you a lot of options, I accidentally lost one part of it so I had to buy another one.It&rsquo;s very easy to adjust your projector without going crazy, some mounts you adjust and it gets loose or moves by itself with time.I bought it twice so I recommend it, the only thing I wish were different is the part that screws to the projector, it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense when I screw to my BenQ projector, it&rsquo;s not symmetric.I also used it in 3 different rooms with different heights as I moved and it never let me down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mount-is-decent-with-caveats">Mount is decent with Caveats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I knew only 3 brackets were needed after reading the reviews but the instructions were accurate besides this omission. I wish most companies would post a quick setup video on their web site in this internet age.Everything was going quite well until the last step when I had to attach the projector bracket to the ceiling bracket but only one of the three screw holes would line up. Furthermore one hole was not keyed for a screw at all. I ended up using two screws instead of three after using a drill to open up the hole a bit on the outside mount to get it to line up the ceiling base. The mount looks sturdy enough for a toddler to swing from so I will not bother processing a return.I would draw special attention to step 3C in the instruction manual where one bolt needs to be screwed to the top cover on the projector. This bolt is the lock to the twist/release mechanism in its absence the projector can fall by accident as reported by a reviewer. My projector is mounted behind a 14 inch beam so I was concerned with getting the image high enough on the wall pass the beam but the mount provides enough flexibilily to lock it at various angles.Update: Locking the picture inside the screen frame was a bit challenging. It required an extra set of hands to hold the projector as shaking from locking kept knocking the picture off alignment. There is a screw you can fiddle with to make it less sensitive but it requires some patience. I recommend against angling your projector for a pure HT setup which can result in keystone correction and white light overspraying outside of your frame.Keep in mind that the mounting holes are set at 2 inches, 9.5 and 11.5 inches on the extension bracket.</p>

<h5 id="minor-adjustments-are-difficult">Minor adjustments are difficult.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this with the BenQ HT2050. The mounting is universal enough that I got it to fit, but it really did not seem like the mount was made for BenQ HT2050, or that they were even made by the same company. I like the internal cord management. The one element that is both good and bad is the ball joint that sets the projector alignment. you don&rsquo;t need any tools to adjust, but making small adjustments can be frustrating. You have to get it lined up on all three axis (pitch, roll, yaw) and hold it with one hand, while tightening the lever with the other, and try not to move the projector at all. And if you need to make a minor adjustment, you need to do it again. There is no easy way to make minor adjustments.</p>

<p>Works perfectly with my W1070 projector. I ended up using my own hardware (fat drywall anchors) instead of what was included just in case.</p>
