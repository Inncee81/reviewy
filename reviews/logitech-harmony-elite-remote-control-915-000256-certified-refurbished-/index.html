<h5 id="still-early-but-so-far-so-good-wasn-t-nearly-as-hard-to-setup-as-the-hype-made-it-out-to-be">Still early, but so far so good. Wasn&rsquo;t nearly as hard to setup as the hype made it out to be.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did not experience the tough setup reported by so many other people. Honestly, for a system consisting of about 7 or 8 components total, it was really as easy as I&rsquo;d expect anyone to make it. Initially it scanned my internet network for devices that it can control, and it only identified my TV, which it then added to its profile saving me the trouble of digging up the model number. From there, I just scrounged up the model number of all my other devices and added them to the profile. Once added, its pretty easy to make the &ldquo;Activities&rdquo; such as Watch TV - the remote setup (which I did primarily only my computer although I&rsquo;ve played with it on the remote itself and the phone app as well) then walks you through which devices are used when watching TV and which inputs each need to be set to. And that was pretty much it for most of my activities. So far, I&rsquo;ve only done one which really required any playing around, and that was setting up an old XBox 360 to not only start up and navigate to the correct inputs, but also to then open the HBO GO app. Since the XBox doesn&rsquo;t have a direct command for opening HBO GO or other applications, you simple have to setup a &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; for the remote, where for example, it does: &ldquo;Boot XBox, Delay 15 seconds, Click Up, Click Right, Click Right, Click Down, Click A&hellip;&rdquo; which simply makes the Harmony hub mimick the process of opening HBO GO from an XBox controller. Honestly, not all that bad.Take that with a grain of salt though, as everyone&rsquo;s got different systems which will likely be different difficulties to setup, and I&rsquo;ve only had the remote for a week and haven&rsquo;t had any opportunity to run into some of the other issues purchasers have reported in other reviews.</p>

<h5 id="great-harmony-remote-for-the-price">Great Harmony remote for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Remote works great, looks brand new, even though it does not have a lot of command buttons you can customize all of the physical buttons as well to add functions to the touch screen and you&rsquo;re set to go. Great harmony product, very happy with purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good-remote">Pretty Good Remote</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast delivery, minimal but protective packaging, includes USB cable but not batteries. Remote was super easy to program, software for programming available on a Logitech site. Start to finish, the setup took no more thsn 5 minutes. Easy to identify buttons function and it mirrors the TV, cable box and DVD player remotes; fairly intuitive. My major complaint is the small button size.</p>

<h5 id="where-have-you-been-all-my-life-kind-of-product">&lsquo;Where have you been all my life?&rsquo; kind of product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having used this product for a few months now, my evaluation is, &lsquo;where were you all my life?&rsquo;. It has its quirks, yes, but the fact that it places four devices that I use all the time in one device and does so easily, (with a few reservations), really places it &lsquo;way up there in my estimation. BTW there is a silicone protector that I also bought, designed just for this product that I believe is really essential for protection. All that said, mention must be made of the few quirks. The first one is that, after programming via computer, (Windows 8.1 version operating system), the update only reached 99% and never got to 100%. After waiting awhile after several attempts, I just disconnected the device and closed the app. on the computer. Low and behold, it worked fine&hellip; with a few more reservations. Here they are: 1). The devices programmed into the universal remote are displayed on the main screen &mdash; all well and good &mdash; however they move around, so you have to be careful that you are selecting the right one. 2). I have a &lsquo;turn on TV&rsquo; option that will SOMETIMES turn on both the TV and my digital interface device at the same time and other times does not. It does not when I have powered down one or the other of the two individually via the remote and then later tried to use the &lsquo;turn on TV&rsquo; option again. Later, it will work again if next time I have powered them both down together via the remote. Other than that, however, it is a truely great product to have and works so easily. My individual remotes, especially for the digitial interface device, were starting to go, with the buttons not working so well, so this is really a great thing to have, with the signal much stronger and more stable. The tactile feedback on the buttons also makes for easier operation, with no need to press too hard.</p>

<h5 id="best-remote-i-ve-ever-used">Best remote I&rsquo;ve ever used.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent remote! It has a nice shape so it fits in the hand comfortably. The button response is great, most remotes sort of mush down when you press them but this remote has a &ldquo;click&rdquo; feel to it. There is no actual click, it just has that &ldquo;feel&rdquo; to it. Buttons are made from an excellent material so I see them lasting quite a long time.The only problem I had wit it was with programming the remote. After installing the software I plugged it into a USB extension from the back of my desktop. It got to 99% and said it couldn&rsquo;t communicate properly with the remote. After a few tries, I plugged it into the front USB port. Again it got to 99% and errored. I then plugged the supplied cable directly into a rear USB port and it programed without a problem. To re-test I installed the software on one of my laptops and the reprogramming worked with no problems. So, if you&rsquo;re programming the remote, stay away from using any sort of extension cable, front port or hub. Just plug it directly into the back of your desktop or on any built in port on your laptop and you&rsquo;ll be fine.As a side note: I bought the remote for my 67 year old mother and she likes it. She had no problems reading the buttons and had no problems using it. Personally I think she&rsquo;s just happy not having to use the old remote like some wizard trying to cast a spell just to get the channel to change.</p>
