<h5 id="excellent">Excellent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a very early adopter of Tile, having ordered a handful of them on Kickstarter. I have since tried several other brands of thing finders (TrackR, Hiro), but keep coming back to Tile on account of the user interface in the app, the range, and the form factor. Tile really is the superior thing finder on the market right now.Tile slim works just like regular tile, only it is, well, slim. Super slim. They are not joking when they say it is as thick as two credit cards. It looks like someone ran over a regular tile with a steamroller. It is way thinner, but also a bit bigger on both sides than the regular tile. It is exactly as long as the height of a credit card.There is no hole for a keyring (this is a bit big for that), and there is a single button in the center (rather than a hidden button buried in the e).Range seems to be about identical to old tile, and time will tell on battery life.Set up is simple. Just open the app and press the plus sign in the app, press the center button on the tile, and it adds itself. That is it. Simple. Just like regular tile. It took maybe 5 seconds to set up.The finder alarm is loud enough that you can actually find what you have linked to your tile, and is simple to activate. Just go into the app, tap find it on the device you are looking for, and walk around listening.And like regular tile, this goes both ways. Press the button on the tile and your phone will start to ring.So bottom line, if you like Tile, you will like Tile Slim. I have often wished that Tile would fit in my wallet, and Tile Slim has answered that wish. My only gripe is that it would be great if it was a little longer on one side, perhaps exactly the dimensions (at least length and width, thickness is already perfect) as a credit card. It feels a bit off balance in my wallet since it is not quite as long as a credit card. So tile, if you are listening, make a credit card sized tile that fits seamlessly in a wallet. OR, make a super cool credit card holder that this securely inserts into. I would pay for that to have it not offbalance my wallet.A word of warning. Regular tile did not have a user serviceable battery. When the battery died, you had to send it in and get a replacement at a decent discount from retail price. This thinner version appears to have the same issue. Assuming battery life is similar to regular tile, you are looking at a yearly re-investment. The battery thing is why I moved away from Tile for a short period, but the reliability of Tile brought me back pretty quickly as the other products could not compete.</p>

<h5 id="relies-more-on-luck-than-technology">Relies more on luck than technology.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Is NOT a foolproof way to keep something from getting lost. Sometimes the app goes days without updating and syncing with the tile. If you lose something and it&rsquo;s been days you then have to rely on other tile users to &ldquo;happen to walk by&rdquo; your lost item. I even turned on the battery-sucking option where it&rsquo;s always on and it still doesn&rsquo;t ping nearly enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-in-2-weeks">Dead in 2 weeks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mine died in 2 weeks, and when I needed this product only a month after I bought it I was left disappointed. I am hopeful that this was just an outlier and that the product is good in general. Amazon sent me a replacement at no cost because of the issues, so I&rsquo;m giving it 2 stars. Will update if the new one is better. This product should give warnings when it has low battery, that would alleviate that problem entirely</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our middle kiddo with autism loves to hide devices once the battery dies (i.e. behind couches, beds and dressers.) Not sure if he is mad at it for dying, but we can&rsquo;t loose any devices because he is non-verbal that is method of communication, AAC. Now we just walk around, look for the green circle, then play the melody&hellip; bam the device is found in no time. We have one less struggle on our ASD plate! And in our crazy life, that is very much appreciated.</p>

<h5 id="nice-form-factor-poor-range">Nice form factor, poor range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Comparing a Tile Slim and a Lapa on an Android (Moto X):Both trackers have the same basic features: ring the tracker or see its last known location on a map, ring your phone from the tracker by pressing it, pay for the hardware but no ongoing fees for the app. After a few weeks both trackers batteries are doing fine, but the Lapa&rsquo;s replaceable battery is a plus (Tile advertizes 1 year battery life). Both apps / both trackers play pretty much the same little melody. They may reduce phone battery life a little, but not drastically; and glancing at Android&rsquo;s battery usage history for today, Tile is on the list at 3% (below Facebook and Screen at about 5%), but Lapa is not listed, presumably meaning it used &lt; 1% (the smallest value on the list).The Tile Slim is a nice form factor (the Lapa is too thick to put inside a wallet), but has poor range. Standing in the same room, maybe 8&rsquo;-12&rsquo; away, the brand new Tile would not ring from the phone. (The phone kept saying it was nearby, but when trying to ring the Tile it would revert to searching.)By comparison the Lapa responds quickly and reliably; in a 4-room apartment its range has been fine. The button on the Lapa (to ring the phone) does not have tactile feedback, but there&rsquo;s a little white light that turns on which does let you know you&rsquo;ve hit the button. The Lapa app also has some nice features I didn&rsquo;t see on Tile: you can set an alert when you leave an item behind, and you can mark an item as lost to benefit from crowd-sourced findings (haven&rsquo;t used that yet).</p>

<h5 id="locator-tone-much-too-quiet-location-range-is-unimpressive">Locator tone much too quiet; Location range is unimpressive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not performing well for me. Tried to locate a wallet with a Tile Slim in it. Tile phone app indicated it was close by but would not pull up specific location on the map. Sent the signal to the Tile to beep but could not hear it as the sound coming from the Tile was (as I found out later) pretty puny. Kept searching the general area until I found it. Once found, I beeped the Tile via the phone app and was very unimpressed with its meager sound output. Almost gave it three stars as I found the Tile, but poor detection range knocks it back down to a two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="needed-it-right-away">Needed it right away</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered one traditional Tile after my husband misplaced his keys. Used that and found it convenient. So when the slim model came out I ordered s four pack. Have also needed to use them. More than once. The GPS feature is great, as is the fact that an entire online community is there to help. The darling little song works well, but could be a bit louder. I could hear it, but my husband could not. And I have had a lot of fun demonstrating it to my friends. Always recommend it strongly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my tiles. I keep one in my wallet and on all of our keys. I keep an extra one at the house hooked onto a cabinet that is connected to several items as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="feel-secure">Feel secure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love my tile! I just started using tile because my work suitcase got stolen by thief. :(Now I can truck and feel more secure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-long-time">Love it long time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The best thing I have ever brought on amazon! Super happy with the purchase. I give it a <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> 😀</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-1">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second purchase of tile. I had the key chain version that I smashed into my wallet. This version hides in the wallet without me even knowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-useful">Very useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lost my wallet a couple times since purchase. Leads me straight to it every time. Very easy to use and understand in the app as well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended">Highly recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter gave this as a gift to her brother for Christmas. He is always losing his wallet. It was missing last couple of days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="memory-loss">Memory Loss</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to medical issues, I have a lot of short term memory loss. I waste so much time looking for things and it is so frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-thing-invented">Best thing invented</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Literally the best thing ever invented if you lose your keys or phone all the time. It&rsquo;s saved me so many times.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-my-tile">Love my Tile!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love what Tile does to help me find my phone! It&rsquo;s thin and unobtrusive, what more could you ask for?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="never-lose-your-keys-again">Never lose your keys again!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just an awesome product! I never lose my keys anymore. Definitely a worthwhile buy and so easy to use. (You can also do the reverse and find your phone with your keys.) amazing!!!</p>
