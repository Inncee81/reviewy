<h5 id="good-budget-back-up-phone">Good budget back up phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchase this sorely to back up my primary phone so my concerns are voice, cell service and wifi quality and so far it fits my needs. When I first open the box noticed that it looks as good as the pictures (looks like a quality build phone) with the metal on the edges, fancy looking back that feels like plastic when touched. Call and cell range quality seems good on T-mobile in my area and internet seems fine while I check emails, google maps (no 802.11ac) overall the phone is fast enough to handy daily task. Screen is sharp and clear, surprisingly, even 1080p Youtube videos look good, touch screen is responsive also. Software looks pretty close to stock Android with the latest version Nougat and everything seems to work with very little bloatware installed unless you consider Amazon apps as bloatware.Since this is just a spare phone for me, not going to post benchmarks or compare higher end phone, I&rsquo;m sure other reviewers will cover that, but did include some indoor/outdoor pictures taken with it.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-device">Great Little Device!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the low $60 Amazon Prime Exclusive price, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting such a solid little device! I thought I&rsquo;d receive something akin to the cheesy plasticky phones you see hanging on hooks in supermarkets next to the cheesy phone plan cards. Nope! This one is a little gem, especially for the low cost!I initially became interested in the phone because it comes with Android Nougat 7.0 right out of the box, and is compatible with my T-Mobile service.Here are the pluses I&rsquo;ve discovered over the past two days I&rsquo;ve owned it:1. Solid, thin, comfortable to hold build: Attractive metal frame around the entire perimeter of the phone, with metal buttons to match. There are more expensive devices out there that are equipped with plastic buttons. I like the textured on/off button. Yes, the back cover is plastic, but it is attractive and has a nice texture to it. The solid feeling/weight of the device gives you an idea why Alcatel provides a 2 year warranty on it.2. Vibrant display: It&rsquo;s 720 x 1280 pixels, with a pixel density of 294 ppi. That may sound anemic compared to mid-tier and &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phones, but it&rsquo;s more than adequate for the average person that needs everyday basic functionality. Don&rsquo;t expect a Samsung Galaxy 8 display at this price point. Personally, I find the Alcatel display to be pleasantly sharp and vivid&ndash;and I&rsquo;m coming from a BLU Vivo XL phone that had an AMOLED display.3. Dragontrail glass screen. It&rsquo;s not as slippery smooth as my wife&rsquo;s BLU Life One X2 screen, but, it&rsquo;s still quite decent. I have always been a Gorilla Glass stalwart, and was wondering if Dragontrail glass would inspire the same confidence. My online search (click on following link) allayed my apprehensions: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1719138/dragontrail-vs-gorilla-super-tough-glass-game4">https://www.fastcompany.com/1719138/dragontrail-vs-gorilla-super-tough-glass-game4</a>. Loud FRONT facing speaker. Works nicely for hands free speakerphone calls, as well as listening to music and Youtube videos, etc. Nice job, Alcatel!5. Android Nougat 7.0 OS. It had a slight learning curve, coming straight from Lollipop, but I caught on in fairly short order.6. Amazon ads are a NON-ISSUE for me. They show up as a small horizontal notification ribbon on the opening screen. If I&rsquo;m not interested in the offer, I simply ignore it and enter my PIN code to unlock the device. Bada Bing Bada Boom!7. Nice gesture features, including: Double tap on screen for waking up the device; Quick double click of the on/off button for opening the camera without having to fumble around to unlock the device first. I like being able to snap an interesting shot at a moment&rsquo;s notice.There are more awesome gestures I haven&rsquo;t mentioned, as well. Check them out on Alcatel&rsquo;s website, or on GSMArena.8. Battery life is good. I have gotten through a whole day of mixed usage before having to recharge.9. It has T-Mobile supported VoLTE functionality, which basically means the voice clarity is crystal clear on both ends, given the signal is carried over an LTE connection instead of a 3G connection. Good stuff!Now, for the issues some people may find objectionable. But remember, this is a $60 device. If you want &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; performance, go buy a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; device for $700 more, instead of dismissing the A30 as a piece of junk.1. Speed: Yes, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 processor can be a little laggy, but, it gets the job done. It&rsquo;s unrealistic to buy a &ldquo;Ford Fiesta&rdquo;, and expect it to burn rubber like a &ldquo;Shelby Cobra&rdquo;. I am typically tapping into 1.5GB of the available 2GB of RAM. To help things along, I close background apps that aren&rsquo;t being used.2. Photos/Video: If you like to take pristine quality photos and video in low light, this is not the device for you. It does, however, take decent quality shots in well lit indoor and outdoor settings. For photos that absolutely MUST sparkle in every lighting situation, I carry my Canon S90 pocket camera with me :)3. Games: This will handle games that aren&rsquo;t graphically demanding. Not an issue for me, I use my Kindle Fire 6 HD for that. ;)Oh, and <em>gasp!</em> &hellip;. I&rsquo;m using this as my &ldquo;daily driver&rdquo;. Yes, I deem it worthy of that to meet my needs in everyday use. I don&rsquo;t need a Ferrari to go to the grocery store. A Toyota Corolla does just fine. :) This baby is a keeper!</p>

<blockquote>
<p> The Alcatel A30 is another low cost phone being subsidized with ads for Amazon Prime members. It sells for $60, the same price as the Blu R1 HD that I reviewed a few months ago. The Alcatel, however, has a version that works with Verizon. Blu&rsquo;s phone only works with GSM providers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile here in the USA.If you&rsquo;re on Verizon this is the least expensive phone out there. If you&rsquo;re not the Blu is the better option at this price point. The Blu phone is faster, better built, and has better video options for its camera.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-great">So far, so GREAT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this phone today. I quickly realized I had to go to the Verizon store to buy a nano sim, as my current one was the larger size. When I went to the Verizon store, the computers did not see this model phone as one of their approved phones. I showed them the box that said it was compatible. They had to do a sort of system override for the computers to switch my line to this phone. I took great care of my previous phone (LG G4) and when it stopped working one day for no reason (after 1 yr 4 months), I decided no longer was I going to pay $700 for phones that do not last. What luck that Amazon has provided this phone. Once activated I realized while a little slower than my LG G4, it did everything the LG G4 could do! The set up was so easy and all my favorite Amazon and Google aps were installed without some of the junk that came on my Verizon purchased phone (ex. NFL mobile that you can&rsquo;t delete). It has only been one day with this phone, but I have a good feeling about it. I am so glad that there is an affordable option. $700 phones are ridiculous!</p>

<h5 id="cheap-replacement">Cheap replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good cheap phone. Needed a quick replacement. Sometimes it freezes up, needs to be restarted, but functions 90%of the time fine. You get what you pay for.</p>
