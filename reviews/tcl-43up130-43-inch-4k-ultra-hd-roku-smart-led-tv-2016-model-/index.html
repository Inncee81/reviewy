<p>Well, I finally bit the bullet and went for a 4K TV&hellip; And I really do like this one. After a few days of use I have had no issues and really like the picture quality (For the price point) and of course the Roku built in is a huge bonus. I will be adding more detail in a video review soon, but wanted to get my thoughts down now.Pros:Price, Starting at Sub $500 for the 43 in model this is a great deal for a 4K TV let alone a Roku 4K TVBuild Quality, Despite being plastic all around it is well put together and doesn&rsquo;t look cheapPicture quality (More specifics on this later as this is both a pro and a con)Roku Functionality, This works as well as all the other Roku boxes I have in my house.Ability to describe inputs and use individual picture settings for each inputCons:Picture Quality controls (Very limited options to control how the picture looks)Only 60Hz real refresh rate (This does allow some blur in very fast moving pictures, but enabling game mode helps a lot)Can only choose from their generic input descriptions (Not really a con but would have been niceOk so all in all I feel this TV is a good option for a budget price 4K TV or even just a Roku TV in general.and the Pros on this unit definitely outweigh the Cons. I replaced a Vizio 1080p Model that had massive software and hardware problems and this is night and day. I actually contacted TCL support prior to purchasing this model to see how responsive they would be and they were very fast (less than 24 hours via email) which given my experience with even more high end TV manufacturers is really good. I would absolutely recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for decent 4K at budget price.Just my thoughts,AK</p>

<p>I have two TCL tv&rsquo;s now. And this one is great too. I am not an expert and can&rsquo;t give in depth technical analysis. This set came with special delivery. Which means they will deliver and set up the tv and remove all the packaging trash.The tv is so easy to set up and start using. HDMI cable to the cable company box, and set up your wi-fi for the roku tv. The picture is very nice, I was worried about &ldquo;pixel effect&rdquo; on close viewing, but this tv has a very nice picture. The remote is so simple and easy to use too. The tv even has a feature where you can press a button on back of the set and the remote will beep so you can find it.The built in sound is good. I have no complaints at all, not tinny and not muffled.The earphone thing on the remote&hellip;. ok, these suck - but the idea is cool, and you can probably hook up a different headphone to it.Probably the only thing I can think of that is missing, is the ability to access the internet. Maybe in the future. Of course I have a computer and a laptop for that and either can display on the tv via the HDMI ports that are easily located on the back of the set facing the side. (so you don&rsquo;t have to try to see behind the tv to get to them.)Why I choose TCL though. After a lot of research on different brands, (and not being a fan of China), I found TCL is the only company that manufactures EVERY part of the television including the screen and the electronics. And the company website is very clear about this and why they continue to do so. Every other brand seams to be elusive to what screen you will get, and outsources various parts.Although I have not had to use their customer service, other reviews stated that they were very responsive and did an outstanding job in that area.So the bottom line is this is a 55&rdquo; 4k resolution, smart tv that costs less then a grand. The quality is great, the picture is very good, and the company seems very solid and dedicated to the customer.</p>

<p>A few years ago my wife and I ditched cable TV and bought a Roku. These days out TV viewing is done entirely from off-the-air local TV, our DVD player, and Roku streaming channels saving us $80/month. Not for everyone, but it works really well for us. We&rsquo;re not super-big TV watchers.Our old 42&rdquo; HDTV had a few challenges with this setup, though. Turning the TV on and using our Roku required two media controllers, one to turn on our TV and control its volume, the other to switch between Roku streaming content providers (Netflix, Hulu+, Amazon, PBS, etc) and select content. Kind of a hassle.This TV gets rid of that hassle with a controller that has an intuitive interface for switching between off-the-air, DVD, and Roku streaming providers. Roku integration is <em>the</em> reason to buy this set.Since the stand-out things about this TV are that it is a 4K Ultra-HD TV with a nifty controller, I thought I&rsquo;d break this review into two sets of pros and cons, one set for the controller and integrated Roku, the other for the TV itself. I&rsquo;ll start with the high point, the controller and ROKU functionality before breaking the bad news on the TV picture and sound.The TV Controller and Roku interface is very nice. It&rsquo;s Roku&rsquo;s top-of-the-line wireless RF remote that works whether it&rsquo;s pointed at the TV or not and has an integrated headphones jack that allows you to plug headphones into the remote and listen to the TV without bothering other people. The integrated headphones on the remote are the reason why we bought this particular Roku TV over any of the other Roku and non-Roku TVs. (Not all Roku TVs have these features. Most of their sets have infra-red controllers that are picky about being pointed directly at the set and do not have a headphone jack.) You&rsquo;ll have no problem using the remote if you are familiar with using a Roku. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Roku, it&rsquo;s very intuitive and easy to learn. You&rsquo;ll mostly (see my comments under &ldquo;Roku Remote Cons, The &lsquo;search&rsquo; button&rdquo;) love it.The bigger down-sides we have found for the remote and its controller software is, first, the off-the-air channel selection options and, second, the &ldquo;search&rdquo; button. The off-the-air options do not allow you to pick &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; off-the-air stations or remove any local stations the software finds, but you don&rsquo;t want to watch, like the foreign language, oldie, shopping, and (copious) televangelist religion stations. We found we have to scroll through these as we find our way to the off-the-air stations we actually want to watch. For a household like ours, that cancelled our cable TV service years ago and watch our local TV news broadcasts and the like, this is disappointing.The other remote down-side is the search button, which is located exactly where the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button was on our old Roku 3 remote. It&rsquo;s easy to push this button by mistake and, when we do, it takes us all the way out of whatever show we were watching to the top of the Roku menu system. It then asks us to push the remote button and speak the name of whatever movie or show we want to search for. This is annoying as all heck when it happens, but we&rsquo;ll get used to avoiding that button over time.Much lower on the annoying features list are the four pre-set channel buttons. On our remote these are Netflix, Amazon, HBO Now, and Sling, sn the destination of these buttons cannot be re-programmed. So, even though we have no intention of getting HBO Now or Sling, we cannot re-program those buttons to take us to streaming content providers we do use, like Hulu+ and PBS. Fortunately the main Roku menu makes getting to these channels very easy.Roku Remote Pros:* Intuitive and easy to use.* Headphone jack for listening to Roku, DVD, and all other content.* Volume up, down, and mute buttons.Roku Remote Cons:* You cannot select off-the-air &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; stations nor delete stations you do not listen to.* The verbal &lsquo;search&rsquo; button is a great idea, but it is centrally located right over the &ldquo;pause&rdquo; button. This is the same location older Roku remotes placed the &ldquo;ok&rdquo; button and it&rsquo;s easy to press by mistake. Once pressed the Search button it takes you all the way out of any streaming channel you&rsquo;re watching to the top menu, then shows you a list of options for the show you asked after, and hitting the &ldquo;back&rdquo; button doesn&rsquo;t return you to where you&rsquo;d really like to be. Really, really annoying.* Also annoying are the four channel buttons on the controller. In our household we use Hulu+ or Netflix for streaming (we switch from one to the other every now and then) and may get Amazon Prime st some point. We also watch PBS and have a favorite News channel, but the four buttons are fixed for Netflix, Sling, HBO Now, and Amazon and cannot be programmed to start Hulu or jump to the News.* The remote is not programmable; you can&rsquo;t use it to control your DVD/BlueRay, cable box, or other equipment.The TV itself has its own set of pros and cons. The TCL television itself is really just OK. Not great. Not terrible. If you don&rsquo;t want the integrated Roku functions there are much better TVs at this price point. The main weakness of the picture is low-light scenes don&rsquo;t have enough contrast to make out details. Watch a vampire flick and all that detail in the dark goes away. Bright colors show up and have adequate contrast, but don&rsquo;t sparkle. After watching our new Roku TV for a couple weeks, my wife decided she liked the clarity and color of our 8-year-old 42&rdquo; 1080p HDTV better. Much better. So, we are returning our Roku TV to Amazon and going with other options.Another challenge with this set is the speakers are weak, but not horrible. This is not an uncommon problem with the new, slim HDTVs, so I&rsquo;m not holding it against them. If you want quality sound you&rsquo;ll probably want to buy a sound bar or use your AV system.TV Pros:* Even screen lighting* Video upscaling from HD* HDMI ARC and CEC allows control over some devices that support the standard* Ethernet and WiFi connectivity* Speakers better than many thin TVs, but not good for home theater.* Low power use: 120w for 55&rdquo; TVTV Cons:* Poor contrast in dark scenes* Weak color.* Screen max brightness weak for well-lit locations* Picture quality controls limited</p>
