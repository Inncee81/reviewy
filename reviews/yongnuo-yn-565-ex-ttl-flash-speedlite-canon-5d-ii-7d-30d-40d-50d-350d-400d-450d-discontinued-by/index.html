<h5 id="finally-an-affordable-solution-for-budget-nikon-cls-enthusiasts">Finally! An affordable solution for budget Nikon CLS enthusiasts!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am what I consider a Semi-Pro photographer. I do it because I love it, Once in a while I get a paying gig. I do all sorts of stuff including event photography.I bought one of these for my home studio, my portable portrait studio and for some special projects. I wanted something that would work with the Nikon CLS system, I NEEDED something with an external battery pack for long shoots and rapid fire shooting - but I couldn&rsquo;t afford a new SB800 or SB900.(THIS UNIT WORKS WITH CANON AND NIKON BOTH!!!)The 8 &ldquo;AA&rdquo; cell external battery pack was about 50 bucks - I was thrilled! YongNuo External Flash Battery Pack SF-18 for Canon EX580 II EX580 Holding 8 AA BatteriesI read the reviews - I saw an awful lot said about firing it 20 times and it dies&hellip; I am no stranger to electronics so the first thing I did when I got it was wring it out in the studio. I figured if I didn&rsquo;t kill it the first night in the studio - it may work for a shoot!I fired it off a lot more than 20 times! However - they state VERY plainly in the manual that if you are going to do any rapid fire shooting, use it at ¼ power or below! I cranked it back and had no issues at all.I use this in a big umbrella type soft box with the cord for the external battery pack dangling down below it (I need some Velcro straps!). I fired it off about 100 times in a relatively short period of time - NO overheating, NO issues - it just worked like it should! BUT - If you don&rsquo;t use the MANUAL EV compensation ON the flash (Which over rides the CLS commands, BTW) and crank it back to about -3 or -4 then you will likely smoke the flash head&hellip; Just a warning to those who read the other reviews!CRANK IT BACK TO KEEP THE HEAD COOL!I set it up to be a slave on Group C Channel 3 and told my Nikon SU800 remote controller it was there. I use ALL my flashes OFF camera! It fired off the first time and every time thereafter - fully utilizing the Nikon CLS control system as far as I could tell. I use several flashes and one totally manual slave and this unit - I think I am going to LIKE this unit!It looks and acts just like a Nikon SB800 to my gear!In close quarters with the softbox - you really don&rsquo;t need FULL power!The Nikon CLS commands work through the diffuser of the softbox - NO problem at all!The menus are easy to figure out once you sit with the manual in one hand and the flash in the other. A couple of times through the menus and you will understand how to use it in 10 minutes or less. I just had to learn what some of the cryptic things said on the display vs. what the really meant&hellip;If you are familiar with CANON flashes - you will figure this thing out in less than 30 seconds&hellip; It&rsquo;s like a 560!I like the &ldquo;hot keys&rdquo; on the back (instead of scrolling through menu options!) and the display is easy enough to read, even without my glasses! The one touch button to turn on the backlighting on the display is great, another touch, it goes off.I like the audio feedback - it will tell you when it is ready for the next frame - I LIKE that&hellip; no more &ldquo;Ooops, the flash wasn&rsquo;t charged enough for the next frame&hellip;.&rdquo; The flashing while in remote mode, always lets you know it is awake.(Turn the &ldquo;power saver&rdquo; to &ldquo;1hr before sleep mode&rdquo; - you will thank yourself later!)(Crank the power back to at least half of normal - you will thank yourself and it will last a LOT longer&hellip; - use the fancy Nikon flash for rapid fire stuff for your rapid fire ON camera stuff and save this from the abuse!)I REALLY like how solid the battery door is - it isn&rsquo;t flimsy like so many other manufacturers. For us old guys, the WHITE lettering inside the door lets you SEE what orientation to put the batteries in - even in low light. As I age and my eyes give out, this has become more and more important! Just a simple little thing - but VERY important to an old fart like me&hellip;It &ldquo;feels&rdquo; hefty - it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a cheap Chinese flash&hellip; It seems to be robust enough to stand up to some serious banging around in the bag for a few years.The zoom feature is a little noisy - but I like that, it tells me it is working!I look forward to using it this weekend on a couple of things and will report back after I have used it on a couple of location and studio shoots. The proof will be told after I shoot about a thousand shots&hellip; And the way some of my shoots go - that wont take very long!I usually swap out my speedlite batteries two or three times during a shoot - this one I hope to last more than twice as long as my SB600 and SB700 workhorses. The external battery pack is awesome - I can&rsquo;t wait to &ldquo;wring it out!&ldquo;I will report back - so far I am pleased! As long as I pay attention to how HOT I make this thing on wedding shoots and fashion shoots, it &ldquo;feels&rdquo; like it ought to be around a while&hellip;Finally, an affordable solution for CLS slave flashes that doesn&rsquo;t cost an arm and a leg!*** UPDATE<strong><em>I shot 348 frames at my last weekend shoot - NO PROBLEMS! BUT - I used it at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> power the entire shoot - it worked flawlessly just like any of my other Nikon Flashes, except for the fact I didn&rsquo;t have to change out the batteries even ONCE!</em></strong> UPDATE*** 04/03/2012 - I have used this flash on several shoots now and shot well over several thousand frames with it&hellip; It hasn&rsquo;t skipped a beat! It outlasts my Nikon flashes 3 to 1 - meaning I have to swap my batteries out in my Nikon flashes 3 times to ONCE with this little jewel on a long shoot. Just remember - CRANK THE POWER BACK for rapid fire shooting!BP</p>

<p>The YN-565 is a decent flash for the money.Its got power and features. However, don&rsquo;t think of the YN-565 as &ldquo;just a YN-568&rdquo; without high speed synch, because there is a decent quality and functionality difference between them.I have both the &lsquo;565 and the &lsquo;568. Both get a four star rating, as being outstanding value, good powerful flashes, but not without their quirks.First, I&rsquo;ve seen reviews of &ldquo;this and that&rdquo; don&rsquo;t work on the flash, such as zoom, or 2nd curtain sync, or compensation, etc. I&rsquo;ve not that problem, except - and this is a biggie - when the data contacts are dirty. I humbly suggest carring a not too soft cotton cloth to wipe the contacts with - both on the flash and on the camera. When they get a little grime on them, the functions go bye-bye and the flash acts goofy (and so does the camera).I&rsquo;ve had a few occasions where the flash will sort of go bonkers at startup, and needs to be turned off again, batteries taken out, and then restarted a minute later. This happens after the flash has been sitting for a while (weeks) with the same batteries and no use. Not sure what that is, but&hellip; its only happened a few times, and only as I just described, never in an actual shooting situation.Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve shot with the &lsquo;565 and &lsquo;568 together, and they work well. The &lsquo;565 does overexpose a little with -MY- setup and needs <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> stop correction. No big deal. I&rsquo;ve shot thousands of shots with the &lsquo;565 at Daytona during BikeWeek and Biketoberfest, nary a hitch.I&rsquo;ve had the &lsquo;565 apart, to see how I could interace my own battery pack. I have not done that yet, but&hellip; aw heck, its a nice clean layout in there, with nice shiny solder joints even on the wired connections, and cute little plugs and sockets holding internal cables from board to board. Mine had what appeared to be hot glue on the plugs and cables to resist fall out during shipping. From the inside - its well made.The LCD screen is not as nice, not as clear and easy to read, as the &lsquo;568, but its adequate, especially in dark places where you&rsquo;ll use the flash. Fill flash in soft shadows during the daytime make the LCD a little harder to read.I&rsquo;ve been shooting seriously since 1975. I&rsquo;ve owned Nikon, Canon, Leica, Hasselblad and Cambo, and used them with the venerable 283 flash and with White Lightning 1200&rsquo;s (banks of six and eight). I&rsquo;m used to using a pair of 283&rsquo;s in a softbox on my shoulder to shoot weddings with a Hasselblad (film!). I&rsquo;d have no problem subbing in the &lsquo;565 or a pair of them for the same purpose if I were to shoot with Canon for those events.However&hellip;. for all its nice features, my money would go with the YN-568 if it was within my finances (at almost twice the price, but not as high as Canon&rsquo;s own flashes!). The usable feature of having a clear LCD is way better on the &lsquo;568, and it does high speed sync.If about a hundred dollars give or take, is all you want to spend, then by all means, get the &lsquo;565, as its a very good bang for the buck.</p>
