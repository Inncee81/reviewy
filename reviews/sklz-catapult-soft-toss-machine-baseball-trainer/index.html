<h5 id="tennis-balls-worked-the-best">Tennis balls worked the best.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This will not really toss the ball to you as described. You literally have to stand right next to it and the machine will pop one up to you about 3 feet in the air. Tried to put it on the setting to help with catching, it launched it about 2 feet in front of the machine, very lightly. We tried waffle balls, practice balls, tennis balls and real balls. Tennis balls worked the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="upset-that-i-had-to-even-give-this-item-a">Upset that I had to even give this item a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upset that I had to even give this item a star. The first one was sent with a broken trajectory lever knob. The balls never could get over the lever that placed them in the ejector. I played around with the ball funnel location but that did not work. We I received the replacement machine the spring was off the bolt. Tried for an hour to reattach the but before I realized that I should not have to fix a new out of the box item. Stay away, the videos for the item don&rsquo;t tell the real story.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="piece-of-junk-get-what-you-pay-for">piece of junk&hellip; get what you pay for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>beware of this&hellip; it is not worth the money. there is a reason it is so much cheaper than other similar items- its poor quality and doesn&rsquo;t work properly. i am a coach and i bought this to help my son train while i am away coaching and unable to work with him. however the machine is such junk it is not able to function in the way they advertise it to.the ball feed malfunctions every time. 1st ball catapults out fine, but every time the second ball feeds into the machine the stop doesn&rsquo;t re-engage and 1-3 more balls fall into the machine causing a 2-3 balls to fly out in various directions. In addition, the net that is marketed with this product also does not work the way it is described. Save your money and spend it on private lessons or on better quality equipment. Remember you get what you pay for!</p>

<h5 id="nice-product-if-no-one-else-around-to-do-soft-toss">Nice product if no one else around to do soft toss</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are going to be doing soft toss with wiffle balls use batteriesIf you are going to do soft toss with hard balls use the 120v ac adapterWorks good and is very repeatable once you get it dialed in</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My grandson loves this tossing machine. It really works well. The balls are indestructable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-unit">Great little Unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little unit for the price. Not made to last the test of time, but should make it through a season or two. Entirely made of plastic, (including the internal parts and mechanisms,) so eventually one of these pieces will break and it will need to be trashed. The unit needs to be plugged in, but does have a battery section to receive a battery(s) (NOT INCLUDED) for portable use. No idea how long the unit will last with batteries&hellip;yet.I&rsquo;ve had the unit for almost a month and my son has been hitting 100 balls per session every day&hellip;so it is holding up well with the use.All in all, this is a good $50 soft toss machine that will serve any level of player for at least a season or two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="difficult-to-adjust">difficult to adjust</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried several different ways, but it doesn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;Soft Toss.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve tried different angles and adjustments. It does pop-ups. I might try it outside to see if it needs heavier balls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-wanted-to-like-it-but">I wanted to like it, but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to like this. I really did. But a couple of flaws popped up, no pun intended. First, when the machine tossed a ball, it would regularly clip the bottom of the ball feeder, making the soft tosses very haphazard. I solved this by removing one of the sections of the feeder, though the obvious drawback was that it would only hold five balls instead of eight.Less than a month after I bought it, the motor abruptly quit working. Thought it was a battery issue so I switched to AC power, but that didn&rsquo;t work either, with the unit producing a humming noise as if it was trying to make itself work. Thankfully it died within the exchange period and Amazon was great about replacing it. I&rsquo;ll update this when the replacement arrives, but for now, I&rsquo;d be cautious about buying this.</p>

<h5 id="the-reload-gets-stuck-and-the-spiral-ball-collector-does">The reload gets stuck and the spiral ball collector does &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The reload gets stuck and the spiral ball collector does not stay lined up. The adjustment is not accurate either ☹️</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great training tool was surprised by its compact size but does the job</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="believe-the-poor-reviews">Believe the poor reviews!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Never worked properly. Hardly has enough power to get the balls a foot off the ground. Pieces broke off as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing product for youth to use to learn on&hellip; very quick setup&hellip; could use more spiral ball feeders so you can hold more than 8 balls but it works you can also order more&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool catapult but not very accurate with putting the ball in the same spot</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="rage-worthy-pos">Rage Worthy POS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nooooope. Please listen to all of the reviewers. Feeds 2 balls at a time and jams nearly every try. Doesn&rsquo;t launch high enough for my 10 year old to do soft toss.</p>
