<p>THE BETTER WAY TO START! SPEED UP LEARNING - BOOST CONFIDENCE - ENJOY A GREAT SKIING EXPERIENCE! CoPilot Ski Trainer TM is an evolutionary ski harness that encourages a natural forward stance and ensures that beginners find their balance intuitively. Unlike upper body harnesses, CoPilotTM leaves the upper body free for the beginner to discover balance while the teacher monitors speed and facilitates turns via the boot reins. Results in accelerated learning, increased confidence and a great skiing experience. COMPONENTS 1) Ski rein: Bright hydrophobic polyester webbing for high visibility and durability - Elasticized webbing to absorb tension and allow for smooth handling - Metal trigger snaps for easily clipping on and off - Total length approximately 16 feet 2) Boot straps: Simple-to-use wraparound polyester webbing straps with Velcro - Metal D-ring for clipping on CoPilotTM 3) Carry Pouch: Strong water resistant woven polypropylene pouch with shoulder strap for easy carrying and stowing before riding the lifts</p>

<h5 id="nice-but-a-little-overpriced">Nice, but a little overpriced.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read a lot of reviews comparing the body harness type trainers and the CoPilot trainer. I think this is better than the body harness units with 1 small exception. You can stop your kid from face planting with the body harness trainer because you have control of their upper body. The CoPilot trainer attaches to the boots and gives you a lot of control, but if you hit a rough patch, your kid is probably going to fall face forward and land on their head.I dinged one star because this should be $19.99, not $39.99. It&rsquo;s just some nylon webbing, bunjie, velcro, and metal hooks sewn together.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-get-the-backpack-version">Don&rsquo;t get the backpack version!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Two years ago, I really debated between this and the harness that attaches to their back. I am thrilled to report my decision for this version was the best! I used the back attached harness on my 6 year old when she was 3 and moved to this one when she was 4.Pros: The foot attachments allowed me to steer her without pulling her down. When I steer the back attached version, any misguidance easily knocked the kid over. With the foot attachment, she skiied easily without being pulled back or having to compensate by leaning forward against the pull from the back strings. This week I took the leg attachments off. Her six year old cousin who started skiing the same day and is using the back attached version, still can&rsquo;t ski alone. This is the best of the two options, really it is. Allows for easy steering, does not get caught on their arms like the back attached, has awesome elastic stretch to help keep them steady, and has proven to be durable, even after my ski runs over it multiple times.Cons: The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is removing the straps at the top and bottom of the lift, but other than a retractable mechanism that might be costly and cause problems on the resort, I don&rsquo;t know how we could address that. Its worth strapping on and off each time, as its still easier than the alternatives.Summary: The foot attached harness was worth the money and was so much easier on me than the back attached version. Tried the back one recently with my youngest 3 year old because I didn&rsquo;t know if the six year old might still need the leg attachments. My back was so much more sore and it did not function as well. Get this one, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll regret it!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-was-skeptical-but-it-really-is-a-great-trainer">I was skeptical but it really is a great trainer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first saw this product in a local ski shop I actually laughed out loud. I mean, just look at the picture. How can you not envision that kid having his feet yanked out from under him and doing a terrible face plant? But in reality, the skis provide the stability and the training harness allow you to control the speed and even the direction of your child while allowing them to learn how to balance their upper body. I agree that the shoulder harness style of trainer tends to limit freedom of movement which slows the learning process. With this trainer you can control what really matters which is speed, while allowing the child to bend their knees, lean forward and balance back and forth naturally. As needed you can also help to steer around obstacles by using the leash just like horse reigns.The only concern I have with this trainer or even the shoulder style, is that you are skiing close behind. Once your child gains confidence and you start skiing at a good speed, if the child falls suddenly it is really easy to run into them. But at the slower speeds you&rsquo;ll be using for the first 5 to 10 days of skiing, the trainer is the perfect length.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-for-learning-to-ski">A must for learning to ski&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 6 yr old grandson learned to ski this season. We watched the ski instructed pulling the kiddos along with a rope attached to his poles. My husband harkened back to the days when he was dragging our (now grown) kids around. I thought, there must be something on Amazon I can buy to suit this need. Of course, I was right. These straps are the best thing ever. They fit around the boot. You&rsquo;re not pulling the kiddo back and thus pulling him/her off balance. They&rsquo;re easy to hook on and off for pit stops. If I&rsquo;d have had these all those years ago my life would have been so much easier. Sigh.BTW&hellip;you also must (MUST) also purchase the ski harness that fits over their coat so you can pull the kiddo up off the ground&hellip;and more importantly&hellip;hold onto him getting on and off the lift. Co-Pilot (I think its called).Both would make a great Christmas gift for new parents of nubbie skiers or a wonderful &ldquo;Welcome to the Mountain&rdquo; gift for the same. I&rsquo;m going to leave these at our ski condo for renters to use:) They&rsquo;ll love me.</p>

<h5 id="really-great-design-i-rairly-write-reviews-but-was-so">Really great design. I rairly write reviews but was so &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really great design. I rairly write reviews but was so impressed with the design of being connected to the boots rather than the back. I went back and forth on which to buy. So glad I picked this one. Used co-pilot for the first time with my 3 yr old son. This was his first time on skis. He did great. The elastic on the straps was very useful. A really great part is the option of towing him around where he would have had to walk or be carried. Towing option is great! I also was able to tow at the bottom getting to lift area. I left the straps on boots loose enough to ski up to him, throw one strap around him, ski in front of him and without stopping start pulling him where we needed to go. The straps would spin around boots. The elastic really helped here. While skiing I was also able to pull one side and initiate a turn. One more thing I really noticed is how by being connected to boots it forced him to work on balancing on his own. You could watch his upper body correcting the entire time. I was stopped by 4 ski instructors who asked about product. Said they had never seen before and felt it was a much better design. At the end of the day was approched by the manager of the ski school and wanted to know the brand and where I got it. He also felt the design was better than backpack.</p>

<h5 id="5-year-old-and-loved-it-this-focused-the-control-to-his-feet">5 year old and loved it! This focused the control to his feet &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this yesterday with my 3.5 year old and loved it! This focused the control to his feet rather than his chest (which last year made him just want to lean back and not stand up on his own) and helped him figure out his balance and center of gravity. I only had to really pull back on the rope a few times to slow him down, but because it has some stretchy-ness it didn&rsquo;t knock him off balance. Highly recommend if you&rsquo;re going to tackle teaching your little one to ski!</p>
