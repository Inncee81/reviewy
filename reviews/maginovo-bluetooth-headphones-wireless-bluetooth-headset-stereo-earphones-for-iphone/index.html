<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-quality-bluetooth-headphones-love-it">Great Quality Bluetooth Headphones! Love it ^.^</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This MAGINOVO Bluetooth headset has an unexpected good quality. I use it with my Samsung Note 5 phone and it is very easy to pair. I use it when I’m driving which included one and a half hours commute each way. Clear sound quality for phone and music, three sizes of inserts for comfortable fit. It comes with a nice zip around case to keep the charger and handset together. I will say that with the decent price and good quality, I would definitely recommend for my friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-amazing-headphone">Great value.Amazing headphone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing! They are light and perfect for running.I highly recommend these Bluetooth headphone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-my-ear-phones">I love my ear phones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the MAGINOVO Wireless Bluetooth headphones.I have had the opportunity to try out many different brands and types of Bluetooth headsets lately, so I know what I like. I hate wearing my Apple headphones because the wire always gets in the way while running or on the elliptical. I have actually tried out these headphones under a difference sellers name, and they are almost identical. Pairing, These headphones paired with my Galaxy S5 within 15 seconds. It was quick and easy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-got-these-and-wowo">Just got these, and wowo!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love them, these are extremely loud for bluetooth with deep base and pretty. neutral mids and highs. Overall they provide a good sound. Came attractively packaged with a soft pleather carry case and plenty of additional earplugs and such. Pairing with Galaxy S6 was a breeze. Sound quality in call is excellent. Sound quality for music and media was far better than I was expecting. Gets a little mushy in the middle if you push it too far volume wise, but otherwise good solid highs and lows. For $35.99 this has to be the best bluetooth wireless headset available!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-wireless-headphones-i-ve-used">Best wireless headphones I&rsquo;ve used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve walked away from my phone or Mac and experienced dropouts only if I’m two rooms away, or beyond thirty feet with no walls in between. This is more than I need, considering I am either at my desk, or in the gym with my phone very close to me. I am very pleased with these earbuds and am glad I bought them. For the price, they truly are exceptional, and to me, they deserve 5 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-headphones">Awesome headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this headphone for working out mostly. They fit in my ears well and do not fall out. The music quality is wonderful as well as the call quality. Love them!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a">A++++</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are the best headphones I have ever bought.They are paired very fast, very easy to use. The sound is excellent and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-great-headphones">This is great headphones!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with the purchase!!&ndash; Easy pairing on all of our Apple products including our iPads, iPhones, and MacBooks. Pairing on each device took approximately 18 second each.&ndash; Noise cancellation feature is excellent.&ndash; Sounds is amazing. Excellent sound quality no matter the programming I am enjoying. Bass sounds deep while treble is clear and clean. The mic is sturdy and sounds crisp and clear. comfortable to wear. I would recommend these.&ndash; The cord is plenty long to comfortably fit around my neck.&ndash; Micro USB charger makes charging easy and quick.&ndash; Range with my iPhone was easily 25 feet.&ndash; Indicator light is a nice touch to visually assure you that everything is working as it should.&ndash; Receiving phone calls is easy. Calls sound clear and the person I am speaking with does not complain about background noise.The functions on the earbud works great. Simple to push to change tracks, power on/off.&ndash; These are possibly the most comfortable earbuds/headphones I have ever worn because they have so many possible adjustments and rotations. The ear loops are bendy and pleasant to wear. These earbuds look durable. The wire strap on it is thick. It is the perfect length to reach behind the ear. The extra earbuds included are great. Each one is marked for the right and left ear. I switched out the original ones for the smallest earbuds, and it fits perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-hate-that-it-didn-t-last-very-long">Absolutely hate that it didn&rsquo;t last very long</h5>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-for-6-months">Worked great for 6 months</h5>
