<h5 id="best-headset-i-ve-used-has-held-up-to-over-a-year-of-solid-use-and-abuse">Best headset I&rsquo;ve used, has held up to over a year of solid use and abuse.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EXCELLENT bluetooth headset, I&rsquo;ve been using it for more than a year now, every single day, without fail.I work in a fairly relaxed retail store, and so I wear this under my collar of my work shirt, and constantly put one or both ear pieces in and out when I have time between stocking/ordering/customers. Even though I push the buttons to change song, adjust volume, answer calls upwards of 50 times per day, they are still fairly crisp and haven&rsquo;t failed me. I was worried at first about the small wires leading to the buds from the main body, but they haven&rsquo;t show the slightly sign of wear and tear except a small twist and bend that has formed from me tucking them into my front pocket or between the buttons of my shirt when I need to put them out of the way.I cycle to work and so I frequently sweat on the headset, but the rubber cover over the charging port has kept the port clean and uncorroded, and the finish as shown minimal wear.The stereo microphones sound fine for calls and occasional use on groupchat apps and programs, and the &ldquo;answer/end call&rdquo; button has worked well with both my Android and my older Windows phone. Minimal wind noise while I&rsquo;m cycling, and with the Windows phone you could even hold down the answer/end call button to activate Cortana. Not sure if that feature works with google Now or Siri on the iPhone.The AptX codec makes a noticeable difference when I play music through my tablet which supports the codec. Less stutter, and crisper sounding music.Battery life is about 5-8 hours OF SOLID USE. Its phenomenal. Really. I can&rsquo;t fathom how this device can weigh only a few grams and get as much run time as it does. On standby I&rsquo;ve had the battery last nearly 4 days. However, if I turn it off, the battery is usually within 20% of the original charge weeks later. Not that I&rsquo;ve had it off for that long many times.Music quality is superb for a bluetooth headset. I&rsquo;ve owned a few other earbuds from Sony and also own a few pairs of studio headphones (such as ATH-M40x headphones and the Sony MDR XB90ex earbuds) and while the sound may not be quite as good as the XB90&rsquo;s which had much larger drivers and could sip more power from my phone/tablet/pc/amp, they sound remarkably close, (slightly less bass, about even midrange and treble) even though the whole headset only costs about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> as much as the earbuds did originally. They certainly don&rsquo;t sound quite as good as the ATH-M40x&rsquo;s, with slightly less crisp highs, and a very recessed amount of bass, but for cycling and taking your mind off of mundane tasks at work, the sound is very nice and certainly a step up from other bluetooth headsets I&rsquo;ve tried in the 50-150 dollar range. I do use a different set of tips from another pair of earbuds I used to have that are slightly softer and to me make a better seal on my ears, which I&rsquo;ve found helps bring out the low end of the earbuds more.One thing to note is that you CAN NOT simultaneously charge AND listen to the bluetooth headset at the same time. However, with the very quick charge time (about 30 minutes to one hour depending on the state of the battery) and the long runtime, you should be able to charge the unit overnight every night and be able to use it throughout the day without any issues.The ONLY part of the headset that is damaged is the small rubber tab that held the separate battery cover flap the the main case of the unit. I&rsquo;ve included a screenshot to show that even though the rubber let go, the cover flap still functions normally and is still attached to the right arm of the set. I&rsquo;ve considered gluing the part back, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary, as it is slightly easier to plug in the charging cable with the flap more out of the way, and when you push the flap into place it is held very securely.I&rsquo;ve since purchased 2 more pairs of this headset, one for a family member and another as a spare, just in case.I highly recommend this headset!I&rsquo;ve included some screenshots of the state of the headset after more than a solid year of use. Top, bottom and some pictures of the charging port flap.</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-bad-design-easy-to-lose">Great quality, bad design, easy to lose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound quality is good and build quality is great. But they don&rsquo;t fit quite well on my neck. I have to adjust them on the back of my head very often, because it tends to move to the sides. I fear I may lose them some day when the earbuds are not in my ear. They shoud have a clip to hold the wires together around your neck when you&rsquo;re not wearing the buds lest you may lose them. Another complaint I have is about the buttons. They are TOO SMALL. And they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;click&rdquo; when you push them. I often find myself feeling all around with my fingertips to try to find the TINY buttons. And when I don&rsquo;t get an immediate response, I never know if I really managed to push them. Until I realize I pushed them twice! My fingers are not large but the buttons of volume and skip are so tiny I feel I&rsquo;m pressing on a pinhead. Not comfortable! I guess with time I&rsquo;ll have a callus on the tip of my pointer. It&rsquo;s a shame for what could have been a great product. I just keep getting back to my really beaten, but otherwise excelent, LG Tones!Update on august/2015: I lost mine today while commuting! I happened to be wearing a collarless shirt and the headset must have slipped on the back of my shirt and fallen to the ground when I didn&rsquo;t have the buds in my ears. These headsets shoud have some mechanism to attach them to your neck or shirt when you&rsquo;re not using the buds.</p>

<h5 id="one-of-the-most-innovative-and-functional-bluetooth-headsets-in-market">One of the most innovative and functional Bluetooth Headsets in Market.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased at least 3 Bluetooth headsets and have been been generally happy with them but never got the perfect mix of quality and functionality. I&rsquo;ve owned the SB50 52 and 40 models. Two had OLED screeds for notification which were helpful but I discovered a true Bluetooth headset needs to be comfortable and practical and have quality sound above all. I found I rarely used the OLED function in previous models and found the clip on of the main unit along with the ear bud cord to be less than comfortable and constantly suffered slippage, and either the main unit clipping off or the ear buds falling off.After continuing to search for the perfect Bluetooth companion for my Xperia ZL smart phone I noticed these which are not widely available. Specialty online stores like Amazon and Ebay were the only place I could find them. My biggest fear was the quality of the sound coming out of the ear buds as they looked small and the wire attached looked thin but went with the reviews claiming they sounded excellent. The price was high but decided to take the plunge and give a try for myself. I&rsquo;ll break down my review in segments.DESIGN:As for as design goes, they are definitely beautiful but have an odd look to them since there is little out there that resembles this design. Really light, love how they stuck to the silver button theme their Z smart phone line have on both ear bud controllers. The design is ingenious&hellip;. the left side has the silver pause button with the volume rockers on either side of it. It&rsquo;s very easy to find the buttons on touch alone which does not require you to lower your head to find them. Very easy to control music without looking. On the right ear bud cord there is a controller for the phone which looks exactly the same except it has a little phone imprinted on silver button. This button allows you to answer and hang up and also has volume rocker. Never had such an intuitive Bluetooth headset which requires no effort to control music or phone calls. The design is also ingenious because it provides perfect balance on both cords avoiding that uneven feeling a lot of smart phone ear buds come with when the control is always located on one side. To add to the balance the main body of the headset is a plastic body you rest on the back of your neck. It&rsquo;s heavy enough to stay in place but not heavy enough for you to notice it. This portion includes the battery, NFC function and led light for charging. I will definitely preface this by saying this Bluetooth headset is NOT for work outs. It is for normal everyday use. It stays in place but if you&rsquo;re active it might not be the best headset for you. So far I&rsquo;ve warn these doing everything from computer work to cleaning to even bike riding but I would not test it beyond that.SOUND QUALITY:Bar none best Bluetooth sound I&rsquo;ve heard. These beat my previous sony Bluetooth models and my dedicated wired smartphone ear buds form Sony which cost 70 bucks. The base is deep with crystal clear sounds. I&rsquo;m seriously in heaven. Normally sound does not have anything to do with the base unit but I have a feeling this one does have something to do with it along with ear buds themselves.BATTERY LIFE:I don&rsquo;t have complaints with this category but do have wishes. The constant use time is anywhere form 5 to 7 hours and this is if you are playing music consistently without stopping. Standby anywhere from a week to 3 days. To charge fully about 2 hours. Not too bad but I would prefer at least 10 to 12 hours of constant use. Certainly not enough to not give this wonderful product a five star rating. It also has a wonderful feature on Android that shows you the battery life and estimation of use and standby time. It&rsquo;s located in the slide down menu which is easy to see quickly but I would recommend to Sony to include a widget for the lock menu to make it even easier to view battery levels.CALL QUALITY:Sound quality is amazing on my end but i have had issues with people hearing me. Small glitch but these do do the job just fine.FUNCTIONALITY:As I said before not OLED screen on these and pretty much no notification light but it does vibrate with texts and phone calls. The point of this headset is it does not rely on visual notifications as the purpose of this is to wear it without knowing it is even there. most comfortable headsets I&rsquo;ve ever warn, they almost feel attached to your body that is how comfortable the feel which of course what they are arming for.Yes I am a Sony Fanboy but cannot express how wonderful this product is, quality sound and one of the most functional products I&rsquo;ve ever warn. So good my wife is getting annoyed with the fact I wear them everywhere. I simply forget I have them on sometimes. Great Job Sony!</p>
