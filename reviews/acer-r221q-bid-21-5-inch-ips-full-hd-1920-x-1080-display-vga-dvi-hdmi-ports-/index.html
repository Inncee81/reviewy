<h5 id="super-thin-and-sleek-2016-model-year-display-from-acer-with-a-3-year-warranty">Super thin and sleek 2016 model year display from Acer with a 3 year-warranty!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PC/Mac technician here. I was looking for a new display for my benches that fit a few requirements&hellip; I have multiple displays(solo display on each separate work bench).1. Must be a new display from this year(2016) - this one being first available March 30th, 2016 on Amazon).2. Must be an IPS panel.3. Must have HDMI, DVI and VGA.4. Must look modern and sleek.5. Must have a matte display(no gloss or glass).6. Must have a VESA mount(which this DOES NOT!! - NOTE TO ACER - provide a VESA mount to snap in instead of the desk base stand with each display!!!). Or sell it for $5.007. Must have a 3-year warranty.This Acer R221Q display fit almost all of my needs. There are third parties that sell a WAY over priced VESA mount bracket that snaps in place of the included desktop base stand for $30 or so. Again - Acer! Include a VESA mount!!!Having a friend who works with metal, we fabricated a gently curved piece of 1.5&rdquo; wide flat steel and tapped it for 2 of the 4 standard VESA mount holes and tapped it for the 2 screws that hold part of the stand that it comes with. This solution = all original parts and the included stand can be re-installed if ever it were to be desk mounted with out any altering of the stock parts. It&rsquo;s very sturdy because this display weighs so little. It&rsquo;s securely attached with only 2 screws into a 100mm vesa mount attached to my bench(articulating arm type screwed to a vertical support).Oh right, back to the review of this display&hellip;For years I have sworn by Dell&rsquo;s premium UltraSharp displays - Dell no longer offers UltraSharp&rsquo;s in anything less than a 24&rdquo; now. 24&rdquo; is too large for my bench setup. Since Dell wasn&rsquo;t an option, I figured I&rsquo;d take a gamble and try out this NEW Acer R221Q which had no reviews. I found a Viewsonic(which had VESA) but it&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; and a 2012 model so that was not considered).This display is super thin depth wise and weighs so little compared to the 8 year old 19&rdquo; Dell it replaced. It has a matte finish and is of high quality.The bulk of the depth is towards the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the bottom of the back of the display where the VGA, DVI and HDMI and power are. It really looks nice mounted on my bench. The menu system is a little clunky compared to Dells and the power button(and other buttons - which are mounted at the bottom of the screen) feel very flimsy, but operate ok. Time will tell how these buttons hold up - 3-year warranty makes me less concerned.The display comes with a VGA cable and an HDMI cable - no DVI cable included. I did notice compared to my older Dell the auto input sensing is far quicker than the Dell display had.I am very pleased with this display. Because it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;zero frame&rdquo; as they call it, it has a very narrow &ldquo;frame&rdquo; around the border(<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; black border). Because of this slimmer frame it is only about 2&rdquo; wider(facing the display) than the 19&rdquo; widescreen it replaced and very much slimmer depth wise - one reason for it&rsquo;s weight loss compared to displays of old is lack of VESA mount thread inserts and the power supply is a brick instead of being built-in to the display. The top <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the back of the display depth-wise is only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; thick - which is awesome!That and modern manufacturing has led to very lightweight panels. This makes for a sleek slim display that looks awesome on my bench - I will be ordering more shortly. I will post a picture of the Dell/Samsung displays this R221Q will be replacing so you may see a comparison shot of <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> year old tech versus current tech(after I order more).The only negatives I have are:VESA MOUNT!!! - please include one acer!!HDMI looks flickery(because it is) having hooked up 3 different PCs(1 desktop, 2 laptops) the video flickers on the HDMI port. I will test this with the next 2 I order to see if it&rsquo;s this specific one I received or something to be concerned with and update this review.</p>

<h5 id="quality-product">Quality product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased one of these monitors because I wanted a dual setup but did not want to buy two in the off chance that I did not like them. I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. The bezel is approximately 1.1 cm wide and makes for an excellent dual or triple monitor setup when compared to my previous monitor&rsquo;s bezel of 2 cm. The monitor itself came with 4 dead pixels (1 in upper left corner, 1 in upper right corner, 2 in lower right corner) which is to be expected but they are unnoticeable. There is also no backlight bleeding which is a plus for myself as I do a lot of work at night. The monitor stand is durable and the only downside to installing it was that some force had to be applied to lock it into place on the monitor (had to be pushed into the slot). Once installed though, the tilt feature worked very well (height cannot be adjusted). Overall, I will be purchasing another of these to finish my dual monitor setup as it definitely is made of quality!</p>

<h5 id="but-the-price-was-very-good-and-well">but the price was very good and, well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was apprehensive when purchasing two of these monitors. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Acer, but the price was very good and, well&hellip;it&rsquo;s Amazon, I could always ship it back. I was surprised when I set them up side by side. The clarity was amazing and for the price even better! I would recommend to anyone.Ronnie</p>

<h5 id="and-i-think-that-this-is-the-best-review-i-can-truly-give-them">and I think that this is the best review I can truly give them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is not much that can be said about these monitors that hasn&rsquo;t been said by Acer themselves. and I think that this is the best review I can truly give them.They are as advertised. They are the quality I hoped, at the price I wanted, with the only negatives being human error problems, and not worth the loss of a star. (see below)Monitors, like many electronics, don&rsquo;t always ship from the same warehouses or factories, and the companies don&rsquo;t always have the luxuries of printing new instructions for each new model.So, my three monitors came in all the same boxes, but SLIGHTLY different packaging inside. One had the cords twist tied in their bags, the others didn&rsquo;t, little differences. But the parts were all there. The instruction manuals were&hellip; vague, and intended to encompass ALL of the models sold when those manuals were printed. nothing that couldn&rsquo;t be figured out with a second read.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-support-29-97p-frame-rate-for-atem-studio-hd">Does not support 29.97p frame rate for ATEM Studio HD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to connect to an Blackmagic Design ATEM Television Studio HD Live Production Switcher, but it didn&rsquo;t support the output frame rate of 1080p 29.97. This would have been perfect since it has a thin bezel and frame. When I connected it to my computer, it looked great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it-the-matte-screen-allows-for-no-glare">i love it, The Matte screen allows for no glare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had this monitor for a few days now, i love it, The Matte screen allows for no glare, 27&rdquo; really does make all the difference, i&rsquo;m still planning on having a duel monitor setup in the future and the zero frame of Acer makes it so easy to just add one later on, and honestly it&rsquo;s very well priced for the quality of this monitor, i bought this monitor to use on my gaming rig i&rsquo;m building and i can&rsquo;t wait to see what this has got when it comes to show time, one also great feature i like is that ability to accept VGA, DVI, and HDMI allowing you to use what ever fits your needs, good job Acer keep up the good quality products</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quite-happy-with-the-monitor">Quite happy with the monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has been my go-to 1920x1080 monitor for a while now and I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. The power button / menu system is bit hokey in the dark but otherwise its a fine monitor that uses very little space on the desk.-Matt</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-picture">Love the picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the picture, sharp, crisp. such a thin bezel I use this with a dual monitor setup alongside an Acer D240H which has been a great monitor but it just looks clunky beside this one, may have to buy one more to match them up.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-home-office">Perfect for my home office</h5>
