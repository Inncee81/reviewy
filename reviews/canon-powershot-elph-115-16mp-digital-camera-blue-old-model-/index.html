<p>From the Manufacturer
Capture Moments with Sophistication</p>

<p>This is an ELPH you&rsquo;ll want in your pocket every day: easy to use and sleekly stylish, the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS is equipped to turn any moment into a high-quality image. The bright, powerful 8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle lens takes you up close for detail and out wide for group shots, while the 16.0 Megapixel sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor deliver sharp resolution and beautifully accurate color. And now you&rsquo;ll shoot longer thanks to the new ECO Mode, which reduces power consumption. Smart AUTO makes high quality easy in any situation by choosing optimal camera settings perfect for 32 recognized scenes. Your memories live on in sharp, true-to-life 720p HD video, and recording starts with a simple push of a button. Intelligent IS eliminates blur by automatically choosing image stabilization that&rsquo;s right for the shooting situation.</p>

<p>Give Images a Whole New Perspective</p>

<p>8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle lens
The PowerShot ELPH 115 IS features a powerful Genuine Canon 8x Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. Fitting a high-performance lens with such wide zoom range into a camera so thin would normally be considered an impossible feat but Canon&rsquo;s expert optical engineering met the challenge, developing a lens that achieves outstanding compactness with high zoom power and superb performance. The zoom starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 224mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering an exceptionally wide range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.</p>

<p>High Resolution, Highly Advanced Performance
16.0 Megapixel sensor
With the camera&rsquo;s 16.0 Megapixels of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the big 8x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution is ideal for creating the largest prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor powers the camera&rsquo;s advanced systems and features, ensuring fast, reliable performance with low battery consumption.</p>

<p>DIGIC 4 Image Processor
Canon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.</p>

<p>A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos
Smart AUTO
Photographers of all levels appreciate a camera – especially a go-anywhere compact digital – that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot ELPH 115 IS digital camera gives you Smart AUTO – sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<p>Shooting Modes/Special Scene Modes
Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.
Portrait    Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background.
Smart Shutter   The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame.
Low Light   For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Fisheye Effect  Now you can get the fisheye effect – a classic photographic distortion – without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect    Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with &ldquo;toy&rdquo; or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Color Accent    Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome.
Color Swap  Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects.
Snow    Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.
Fireworks   Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.
Stitch Assist   Easy-to-use guidelines simplify the shooting of aligned multiple frames that can later be combined (using bundled software) to create panoramic photos.
Movie   Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.
Gorgeous HD Video From Your Still Camera
Shoot brilliant 720p HD video
You can shoot high definition video anytime, anywhere, with the pocket-sized PowerShot ELPH 115 IS. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you&rsquo;ll be able to instantly record every moment in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid, and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories. In addition to being able to shoot 720p HD video at 25 frames per second, the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS can also shoot 640 x 480 VGA video at 30* frames per second.</p>

<p>*Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.</p>

<p>Dedicated movie button for easy video capture
It&rsquo;s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. To make shooting video as natural as snapping pictures, the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS has a dedicated movie button. No need to plan ahead, no need to search through menus on the LCD screen; when you feel a moment would be best captured in 720p HD, simply press the button and recording begins. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want.</p>

<p>A Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image
Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.</p>

<p>Normal  Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid)  Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
A Charge that Lasts as Long as a Memory</p>

<p>New ECO Mode helps reduce power consumption for longer battery life
The PowerShot ELPH 115 IS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won&rsquo;t miss the moment. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the evening, ECO Mode on the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS makes sure your camera keeps up.</p>

<h5 id="okay-for-the-price">Okay for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this as a gift for my wife who takes tons of pictures and needed to replace her failing sony camera similar to this one that she keeps with her <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. We went with Canon because it&rsquo;s overall the best. We have a Canon Digital SLR with add on lenses and flashes and absolutely love it. Canon rocks!This particular (ELPH 115) camera though we were not so happy with. Unless you held the camera completely still and the person or object were completely still, the picture always turned out blurry. Unsure if there was a problem with the Image Stablization (IS) or if the camera itself was not as good as we expected. We tested with IS on and off and it didn&rsquo;t seem to make a difference with blurry pictures.Amazon was GREAT with the return process. Emailed a prepaid UPS return label and issued a full credit. Once my wife&rsquo;s Sony camera failes completely we will probably go to a local store to get a hands on test of some different model cameras and then order online again. I still plan to go with a Canon model but I&rsquo;ll be sure she&rsquo;s happy with the picture quality before making a purchase.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-a-smart-phone-that-takes-pictures-quite-will-too">I have a smart phone that takes pictures quite will too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace my broken Canon PowerShot A480 camera that captured photos and videos in the standard ratio. I have a smart phone that takes pictures quite will too. When I compare the captured images and videos taken by my HTC smart phone camera to this ones taken by my canon, I don&rsquo;t see much of a difference besides it having a more clear image when I zoom and record or zoom and take pictures with it. I notice smart phones are starting to take the place of small handheld cameras like this. The images are still slightly sharper on my canon but with my phone, I can just upload it automatically to my social media as apposed to taking the time to hook this camera up to my laptop, transfer my images, and edit them. If you alreday have a new model smart phone that takes pictures well, I would stick with that instead of paying extra for a small handheld camera. If you really want premium high quality images, I&rsquo;d recommend a professional camera or a photographer.</p>

<h5 id="ok-but-not-great">OK, but not great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a small camera, easy to carry around in pocket or purse and instinctive to use. All the controls are easy to decipher and use. It comes with one battery and the charger and the battery charges fairly fast.The image quality is OK as far as sharpness is concerned but the color rendition is not true to subject, it&rsquo;s a little bit under saturated, particularly the blues (what should have been a royal blue had too much cyan). It also doesn&rsquo;t perform as well in very bright situations and tends to overexpose. Granted, you can fix all that in Photoshop, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shutter-sticks-on-anything-less-that-direct-sunlight-so-75-of-the-photos-become-blurred">Shutter Sticks on anything less that direct sunlight so 75% of the photos become Blurred</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought as a replacement camera for my Sony Cyber-shot. I was thinking that the Cannon name means quality and getting a newer digital camera it would take quality digital photos mostly of events and holidays. Camera started of ok. I thought the quality was less than my previous camera but I liked the digital videos so I tried to suck it up. Six months of ownership the camera started having issues. The flash takes a long time to &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; so important shots are missed. Also the shutter sticks on anything less that direct sunlight so 75% of the photos become blurred or don&rsquo;t turn out at all. I can&rsquo;t believe such a quality brand name would put out such a defective item. As a consumer I am deeply disappointed and due to the inability for SONY or Amazon to stand by their product I will never buy a Cannon product again.</p>

<h5 id="fine-little-camera-for-those-with-no-photographic-ambition">Fine Little Camera for Those with No Photographic Ambition</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this little camera because I lack photographic ambition. I&rsquo;m simply never going to be one of those guys who walks around with a huge honkin SLR, snapping amazing pictures, cataloging my own life and the lives of those around me, and then uploading phenomenal photos to the web. Instead, I take pictures of landscapes I think will look good, then view the pic later and inevitably think to myself &ldquo;What the heck was I thinking?&ldquo;This is just the right camera for the person who is not going to be a photographer, but just wants to capture a bunch of images that will then clog your computer&rsquo;s memory. Small, easy to use, etc. I even dropped mine in a cold mountain river, pulled it out, dried it for a few days, and it came back to life. What more could the non-photographer ask for?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="avoid-not-nearly-as-user-friendly-as-earlier-canons">AVOID - Not nearly as user friendly as earlier Canons</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate to say as I am a &ldquo;Canon Guy,&rdquo; and I even bought THREE of these at once (Personal, Gift, Work related) and it&rsquo;s not nearly as user friendly as my similar Cannons from 2008, 2010, 2012 respectively.It&rsquo;s a memory hog - every photo shot is very large, making it hard and clunky to work with on regular computers and amateur softwares - the auto focus is not nearly as fast either&hellip;Only moderately user friendly. I&rsquo;ll be looking for something else before long sorry to say.</p>

<h5 id="elph-115-digital-camera">ELPH 115 Digital Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little camera that needs very little adjustments. We use it daily and only wish it would click faster to catch our new puppy in his antics. It&rsquo;s not as slow as our A30 Canon in snapping shots was but still maybe that&rsquo;s a digital problem. Can&rsquo;t really complain, we just keep clicking. The screen is a good size so you can see the picture without difficulty. BUT, if you are outside and it&rsquo;s very bright out, you will have trouble seeing on the screen what you are trying to take and need to guess you have it, there is no view finder. For the average photog it&rsquo;s a good buy and takes really nice clear shots.A November addition to my September review. Be very careful of dropping, bumping or whatever with this little camera. Ours met the side of the house and then the deck when icy steps took my husband down. The camera then said &ldquo;lens error, restart&rdquo;. Not happening. Need to send for repair or replacement but need to buy a magnifying glass so I can read the insurance plan received from Canopy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-a-cheaper-camera-so-you-can-replace-it-every-six-months">BUY A CHEAPER CAMERA SO YOU CAN REPLACE IT EVERY SIX MONTHS!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera was superb however it died after 11 months. Canon replaced it under warranty after multiple complaints however the replacement just died as well after 11 months. Better to buy a cheaper camera so that you can replace it every six months which is what I plan to do now! I have been a Canon camera owner for decades but I am done now.</p>
