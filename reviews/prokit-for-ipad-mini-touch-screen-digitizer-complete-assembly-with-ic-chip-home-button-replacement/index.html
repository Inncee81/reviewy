<h5 id="product-is-good-works-great">Product is good, works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I replaced a cracked screen and damaged digitizer. I had read a few comments (not necessarily for this product) that complained about opening a damaged product, but being unable to prove it was damaged in transit, they were out the money. This was not the case for me, but to be safe I had my husband video me opening and examining the package just in case.The product itself worked wonderfully. Once installed everything worked great. 5 stars for product.2 stars for instruction on installing. I knew from the description that it would not come with instructions, and I was confident I could figure it out using resources online. I used the video suggested by the seller, and it is lacking, to say the least. Here are my suggestions:It takes several minutes to heat the adhesive enough to remove it quickly using a hairdryer. Do not expect to go around the edges a dozen times and be able to unstick it. Take your time.Use white cups or white plates or white SOMETHING for the screws. There are a bunch of them, and there are several different sizes. And did I mention they are TINY. Smaller than a pin head, I swear. Count them on the way out, put them somewhere in order of how they came out, so you know exactly where they go when you put them back in.Watch the video a few times so you know what order to put it all back together. Taking it apart is easy. Getting it in the right order when you put it back together requires more thought. Not difficult, but I put the LCD screen back down a couple times before I remembered there are two metal plates I had to screw back in before the LCD.Test everything before you put the adhesive back together. Tap all the corners, try out the keyboard, make sure the home screen works. Double check that it will lay flat. When I removed the old screen, the old adhesive warped a bit from the tools and I had to remove some of it so the new screen and adhesive could lay flat.The adhesive on the new screen has a film on it that will need to be removed. It is tricky to get a corner off. Make sure you get ALL the adhesive films off!! Some are tiny!</p>

<h5 id="no-issues-whatsoever-read-full-review">No issues whatsoever, read full review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit comes with absolutely everything you need (with an exception of a blowdryer) to remove and replace your iPad mini screen and works absolutely perfectly. I have seen people complain that their iPad lost the magnetic lock function after replacing the screen and that&rsquo;s because you have to pull the magnets from your old screen and replace them before installing this one (I personally did not do this because I don&rsquo;t use a magnetic case so this feature doesn&rsquo;t matter to me). Also, do not remove the adhesive backing until you TURN ON your iPad and TEST the screen BEFORE sealing it down permanently because once it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s done. I&rsquo;ve also seen complaints that the home button felt flimsy, from my experience the home button felt fine although there is little bit of play in it, more so than the original but do keep in mind that you can remove the home button from your old screen and apply it to this one (for me, it wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble, the home button works fine.) Make sure you understand exactly what you&rsquo;re doing before attempting this and you won&rsquo;t have any complaints. This 25 dollar screen brought my 300 dollar iPad back to life and I&rsquo;ll buy it again if I have to.</p>

<h5 id="fit-is-ok">Fit is ok.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The job is tedious. If you can&rsquo;t focus on details, let someone else do it. I was unable to remove it w/o a lot of shattered glass. So, getting all that out was time consuming. CLEAN THOROUGHLY. Once it is re-sealed, it is in there for good.As for the product, other than difficulty getting the adhesive to stick, it works fine. It is difficult to know how much heat to apply to activate the adhesive. Also, the adhesive on the sides is very narrow ( Apple&rsquo;s design fault ), so make sure you are careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-complete-set">Great, complete set!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything I needed to replace my screen was there! A little advice for future screen fixers is to make sure you straighten out any dents on the corners if you have any. I had a dent which caused the screen to not sit right and by pressing the corner of the screen to make it fit, it caused the screen to crack again. I had to reorder another screen which was not costly considering I have all the tools already. But the screen did crack very easily. Other than that, a great tool set!</p>

<h5 id="it-worked-fine-for-about-2-3-weeks-but-then-a-dead-zone">It worked fine for about 2-3 weeks but then a dead zone &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought one of these for an iPad 2. It worked fine for about 2-3 weeks but then a dead zone appeared on part of the screen. Waste of time and money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality and it worked well in the end. I found the instructions to be lacking a bit, but was able to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-pretty-well-home-button-is-a-bit-stiff-and">worked pretty well. Home button is a bit stiff and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>worked pretty well. Home button is a bit stiff and the adhesive doesn&rsquo;t really work that well. But for the price you can&rsquo;t beat it.</p>

<p>Took like 2 hours, but now we have a new screen and our iPad is like new again!</p>

<p>Was super skeptical with it being $20 but got it today and installed it in about half an hour, watched a few YouTube videos to get the idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect and it worked perfectly! Best money I&rsquo;ve spent!</p>
