<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-so-far">Perfect so far!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, I&rsquo;m really loving this baby monitor! I can go all the way out to my back yard and it still gets service and stays connected! This is the main reason we got it. So I can come out back with my 3yr old and play, and not worry about not hearing his brother if he wakes up. I will update if I find any cons with it but so far it&rsquo;s all pros ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-so-pleased-with-both-the-day-and-night-vision-and-the">I am so pleased with both the day and night vision and the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m due in a few weeks but I hooked this up to make sure it worked and I was shocked by the quality of the image and all of the features for the price! I am so pleased with both the day and night vision and the sound quality. The lullabies are a nice touch as well! I am so happy this also tells me the temperature in the room so I have one less thing to worry about! I&rsquo;ve very happy I purchased this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this as a replacement for another brand that died after a month&hellip; I LOVE this monitor! You can touch the power button to shut the video screen off and just have sound at night (we like to sleep with a very dark room). It has a night mode and it&rsquo;s so clear!!!! Holds a charge so well, so I can see baby while she&rsquo;s napping while I&rsquo;m in the kitchen cleaning up. Easy to set up and wonderful to use!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-quality-well-rounded-unit">A quality, well rounded unit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have been searching for a functional, well rounded monitor system. This unit is just that. It comes equipped with additional features we were surprised to find, lullaby music, Eco mode, zoom feature, and two way voice interaction. The night vision provides a clear, crisp image. My only recommendation would be a longer battery life on the unit, but it is sufficient for our needs. We are very pleased with this unit.We received this unit at a discounted price in exchange for providing an honest review.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mileage-may-vary">mileage may vary</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: Soon after I wrote the review below, a nice customer representative named Anna contacted me directly and told me they believe I got a faulty unit. She kindly suggested to send me a replacement, even though I&rsquo;m living in a country they wouldn&rsquo;t normally ship items to. I just received the new one. I&rsquo;m still having similar issues with the new unit but I really appreciate this kind of customer service. In the end of the day, I guess that for its price the monitor and camera are doing an OK job. The reception is very solid all around the house and that what matters the most when it comes to keeping an eye on our baby. I guess that I shouldn&rsquo;t expect military grade results from a commercial night vision camera, right ? Once again, if the high end monitors are too expensive for your budget you can probably give this one a go.Camera will rarely switch from night vision to day mode, even if the room is 100% lit with house light. Need to point it directly to natural light for it to switch. Quality of the picture is not great. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this product at all.</p>

<h5 id="this-wireless-baby-video-monitor-is-a-great-product-i-got-this-to-monitor-my-newborn">This wireless baby video monitor is a great product. I got this to monitor my newborn &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wireless baby video monitor is a great product. I got this to monitor my newborn baby. This is very helpful. The camera is able to turn up and down and turn around 360 degree. I can set it at any desired angle. When camera and reciever are power up, they automatically connect wirelessly. The receiver is very easy to control. It can be charged and use it cordless, so i can carry it around while i am away from my baby. The image of the camera is very clear, i can see my baby clearly. Also, the two-way audio feature is awesome. I can hear from my baby and i am able to speak to my baby through the receiver.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-monitor">Great monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had this for about a couple weeks now, but so far I am very happy with it! It is very lightweight and easy to use. Installation was quick and simple. The features are great. I love I can see the temperature in the room and I love the feature that mutes the sound until she makes a noise. All she has to do is squeak and the volume turns on. I love this feature because my LO sleeps with a sound machine but it doesn&rsquo;t pick up on that sound, only my little girls noises. The picture quality is good and clear and I love that you can zoom in and out. I leave the monitor unplugged all day and it holds a charge great!</p>

<h5 id="and-going-to-see-the-grandparents-after-it-was-recommended-on-a-fb-mom-s-group">&hellip; and going to see the grandparents after it was recommended on a fb mom&rsquo;s group</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this as an extra video monitor for travel and going to see the grandparents after itwas recommended on a fb mom&rsquo;s group. It has a better range and battery life than our expensive original one! I wish I knew about this one sooner!</p>

<p>I love this baby monitor, however, my camera somehow came off of the base, and I don&rsquo;t know where the piece that goes in it went.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-want-i-needed">Exactly want I needed</h5>

<p>Simple and does the job. I wasn’t gonna get a camera until I realized baby tears break my heart. The price helps my piece of mind and my wallet .</p>
