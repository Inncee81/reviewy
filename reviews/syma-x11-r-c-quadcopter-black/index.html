<h5 id="intermittent-power-problems-and-solution">Intermittent Power Problems and Solution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mine came with an issue where it would shut off randomly mid-air. Before returning, I opened it and found a cold solder joint on the negative power cable at the main board. (See attached pics.) If you have intermittent power problems you may want to check this.</p>

<h5 id="what-to-expect-from-a-25-quadcopter">What to expect from a $25 quadcopter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I won&rsquo;t do a Pro/Con review because it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit here. I&rsquo;ll just say what to expect.First, this is a $25 &ldquo;toy&rdquo; multirotor. Don&rsquo;t expect GPS, return to home, smartphone integration or even a camera on this thing. It&rsquo;s not going to lift a GoPro or even a keychain camera. So no 360 selfies. It also doesn&rsquo;t fly itself, so there will be a learning curve for new flyers.So why buy this?Buy this if you really want to learn to fly a stable multirotor without paying $80 - $100 dollars. Cheerson and Hubsan nanoquads fall into this category as well. This quad is big enough to not be too unstable and twitchy in flight, but small enough so that crashing won&rsquo;t scare everyone in your neighborhood.A few tips:Get a piece of electrical tape and add a small tab to the back end of the battery where the wires come out. That way you can pull on your tab instead of the wires. The wires aren&rsquo;t connected by anything but solder and you <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to stress them.Don&rsquo;t fly this thing too high or near trees. Yeah, its tempting to see how high this will go, but remember that without power to the rotors this will fall like a rock. As for trees, its harder to get a quad out of branches than you think.Buy extra propellers before you buy more batteries. Even with prop guards on, you can still break props faster than killing a battery.You can repair quads, but you really want to be very familiar with soldering before you attempt it. The circuit board is cramped and the motors are soldered directly to the board.That&rsquo;s all I have. Happy flying!</p>

<h5 id="great-little-drone">Great little drone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used and abused this drone as a test to see if it is what I needed to order for my classroom. I can now say that it is a great little flyer for indoors as long as you have a big enough space to fly! It is powerful and can get some speed on it if allowed to do so. The included battery is great, but I tried it with a 380 MAh battery and it is even better! Longer flight times and more power, but not too heavy. I wish the prop guard was made a little differently as the little pins that hold it to the quad break off easily. However, knowing that part is like training wheels for drones means that it is suppose to fly without it and therefore of no consequence if it is lost or broken. This was my first drone I had ever flown, and it helped me to gain some confidence in flying. It can be flown outdoors on a calm day, but any wind will send it to the neighbor&rsquo;s yard or trees! If you can get in a gymnasium or similar place with high ceilings and room to fly then this little quad will really shine!</p>

<h5 id="a-lot-of-fun">A lot of fun!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this quadcopter for my 8 year old son. I figured it would be pretty flimsy and not work very well because it was so cheap. It has been a year and we had to buy some more blades because we broke a few but it is still flying. The remote on this toy is great. The quadcopter is very sensitive and once you get the hang of it you you can fly this through some tight spots. The battery last for 10 to 15 minutes and it charges in about 20 minutes.My son can fly it but sometimes it can get out of control and drop out of the sky or slam into something. So far nothing has destroyed it yet. For the money it is a blast. We fly it inside but you should learn outside on the grass to get the hang of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-fly-near-the-treeline">DON&rsquo;T fly near the treeline!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like most of the stuff I buy here on Amazon, this was for my teenage son. Once in a while I do get to buy something for myself, like shampoo or toothpaste but the fun stuff is usually for him. This was an inexpensive way for him to start learning about drones, it has no camera iand was relatively inexpensive. That said, it was a great deal of fun for him to fly and I even purchased some extra batteries for it. The instruction point out that you should not fly this quad-copter above the treeline and they are not kidding. Right now, the copter is sitting near the top of a very tall tree in our neighborhood where it has remained through many hard winds and tunderstorms. It&rsquo;s summer now so I suppose I need to get him another one to take a chance with. I hope that he has learned his lesson and flies it in a more open area awy from buildings and trees. Fun while it lasted and definitely flies high for such a little toy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-was-a-lot-of-fun-while-it-lasted">it was a lot of fun while it lasted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one in December was stolen from my door, no fault of the company. I purchased it again, and it lasted six weeks before one of the motors had increased resistance to turning, and could not keep the drone in the air. Otherwise, it was a lot of fun while it lasted. Make sure it doesn&rsquo;t get under couches where it may pick up threads from the fabric. Clear all theads from rotors immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-investment">NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter ordered this and was so excited to get it in, but only after about 30 minutes of use in an open field, AFTER she read directions and watched a video the product quit&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-drone">Love this drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this drone. So much fun the fly. This is a very sturdy drone. I have run it in to tree, the house, etc. Runtime is good. This is a great way to learn to fly a quad copter.</p>

<h5 id="fly-s-really-well">Fly&rsquo;s really well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the low price I was skeptical it would get airborne without me throwing it. I was wrong and it actually is very responsive and powerful.</p>

<p>Very fun to watch it it&rsquo;s a great little drone but the remote control is very sensitive and will crash othwise is awesome drone</p>
