<h5 id="outstanding-travel-clothesline">Outstanding travel clothesline!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for a 2-week Panama Canal cruise. My husband and I only take carry-on luggage, so doing laundry by hand is essential. We had previously used a braided latex clothesline and although good, I wanted something longer and lighter.This is 11-feet long and very small and light-weight.Our only question was how to hang clothes. We didn&rsquo;t want to haul clothespins, and knew that hanging t-shirts or socks over the line meant the clothing might not dry.The solution? Bread bag tags. Yep, the little rectangular thingies with the bread pull date on them. Perfect for clothespins! They are free, lightweight, and if they break, you just toss them. They take up no room and worked like a charm. Why didn&rsquo;t we think of this years ago?So our laundry kit consisted of: this clothesline, a handful of bread bag tags, a small neoprene bottle with powdered detergent, and a rubber sink stopper, just in case.Result&ndash;doing hand laundry on the cruise ship was so easy that we had actually overpacked. Didn&rsquo;t need many of the clothes we took because all of our polyester/nylon shirts and pants washed out in the sink and easily dried overnight.This clothesline is very easy to set up, the beads held our shirts, and the bread bag tags held everything else.This clothesline and the bread bag tags are now a permanent part of our travel supplies.Highly recommend this travel clothesline!</p>

<h5 id="handy-dandy-clothesline">Handy Dandy Clothesline</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little skeptical about how the retention clip will hold up in the long run, because it&rsquo;s a pretty thin plastic. However, for about two weeks of holding up two uniform blouses, a Winter fleece, socks, and other various small objects, it has done a remarkable job.I&rsquo;ve got the line fastened to three points on the inside of a tent I sleep in, just above my rack. Occasionally, I need to slide the little beads closer to my blouses that are hanging on the line, but they&rsquo;re so heavy I&rsquo;m surprised they stay at all. Just about everyday, a few times a day, a helicopter comes in (I&rsquo;m deployed and I sleep next to a landing zone) and shakes our tent to hell and back, but the line keeps a hold of all my hanging objects.I love it - highly recommended. (Wish I&rsquo;d bought two of them)</p>

<h5 id="invaluable-for-traveling-light">Invaluable for traveling light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is another great product from Seat to Summit. I hesitated buying what seemed like a fancy piece of nylon cord, but here&rsquo;s why I really ended up liking it.Flexible design: hook and tackle on one end makes it easy to shorten the cord a bit.Compact: the case is tiny (about 3&rdquo;x2&rdquo;x1&rdquo;); the beads do a good job to keep small items attached without bringing more stuffLightweight: 1 oz / 28 g.Safe: reflective thread&ndash;campers can see this at night with their flashlightsStrong: the cord has no problem being pulled taught with wet laundry on itAn ultralightweight camera tripod worked great as a stand alone anchor when I weighted it down with a full 2L water bottle. I bet a rollerboard extended handle would work too. A single line (11&rsquo; at the very longest once you hook it) ought to work for one or two people&rsquo;s laundry, but if you are on the go and have that one day to do laundry or have a small family the single line might not be long enough if you are trying to dry out items so they folded over the line so as to reduce wrinkling. Being able to do laundry anywhere is key to traveling light&ndash;this makes it possible to pack only about a week&rsquo;s worth of clothing regardless of the length of the trip! This will be a permanent addition to my vacation travel packing list.</p>

<h5 id="beyond-my-expectation">Beyond my expectation!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Backpacking can be tough sometimes when it comes to laundry &hellip; well not anymore!! This clothesline is awesome. Size can be adjusted and wrapped around almost anything. We were on the move quite a bit so did not have time to leave our laundry with the hostels for 24+ hours. It stores super small, and the lack of clips really saves on space. We had no issues at all with hanging clothes with the pegs; they worked great. We really expected we&rsquo;d run into some snafu with the line at some point, but we were able to set it up everywhere (even on the cruise ship after the backpacking!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-ok-but-really-not-worth-the-extra-money-over-a-utility-cord">Works OK, but really not worth the extra money over a utility cord.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this on a recent trip to Turkey. It worked OK, but to be honest a small utility cord would have worked just as well. The hooks that it came with to attach to things only work if the object is shaped perfectly, otherwise you are stuck ting it in some way. Also, I did not find the little sliders that you use to tighten clothes to the line to be very helpful. I suppose if you were using this in a windy environment they may be useful, but if you are using it in a hotel room like I was, they are not needed. Finally, I found the length to be a little short to be that useful. You can really only get 2 - 3 sets of cloths on it at a time.All in all, I would recommend saving a little money and buying a utility cord that is a bit longer, lighter and stronger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="travel-with-me-everywhere">travel with me everywhere</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I take this with me everywhere I travel since I wash my clothes everyday. It has lasted 3 years thus far. I like that it packs into a small pouch. With certain clothes, the black color of the clothesline becomes stained on certain clothes but I was able to rewash my clothes and the black line stain came off. So, just we wary of certain clothes. If it was cheaper I would give it 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="the-beads-did-a-good-job-holding-light-things-like-socks-and-underwear">The beads did a good job holding light things like socks and underwear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So tiny, and so handy. On a recent trip overseas, I strung it between a door handle and a dresser knob to dry out my daily sink washing. The beads did a good job holding light things like socks and underwear. I didn&rsquo;t hang anything heavy on it, so I don&rsquo;t know how well the beads hold things like pants or shirts, but I saw some video reviews showing it&rsquo;s quite sturdy. This will become a permanent part of my travel gear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-enough-beads-on-the-line">not enough beads on the line</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have enough beads to secure a bunch of small items like socks. I brought extra-large plastic paper clips to keep items like that in place. A plus is that it&rsquo;s very compact, and if you&rsquo;re adroit enough you can get corners of 2 garments pinched between each pair of beads. This allows about 9 garments of lightweight fabric to be hung on the cord. Another plus is that the line is very compact to pack, and that you can make a loop in the line to put the hook at the end through for easy adjustments to the length of the line.</p>

<p>It worked great during our Europe trip. The hook broke off after a couple of use, but I just tied it into a knot, so it still served it&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
