<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="these-is-an-awesome-beginner-set-for-children">These is an awesome beginner set for children</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These is an awesome beginner set for children. The cups are very small so not too difficult to use. I have a two year old, and an eight month old. The bowls are perfect size for toddler portions, while still being perfect to feed my baby pureed foods. The bowl has a slight slant to it which makes it much easier for toddlers to feed and for me to scoop up purees for my baby.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and the price was great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adorable">ADORABLE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bowls:My son is 6 months old and recently started eating cereal. The bowls are a little large for cereal alone but I like that they will &ldquo;grow&rdquo; with him and accommodate more food in the future. He loves the bright colors and has come to recognize them. When he sees the bowl he gets excited, knowing that food is coming! The fish design is a cute bonus.Cups:I&rsquo;m already cup training my son and these are perfect. They are short and stout, perfect for little hands. I put just enough liquid in the cup for a sip at a time to avoid big spills. He loves to help mommy and be a big boy sipping from his cups. The lip of the cup is nice and smooth so I don&rsquo;t worry about it cutting his sensitive gums. This is a fun treat for my little guy who is so eager to learn EVERYTHING right now!Plates:We haven&rsquo;t used the plates yet, as he is not at the finger food stage yet. I will update my review once we have put them to use!Overall, this is a great value and will be put to good use for a least a few years. Would definitely recommend.</p>

<h5 id="great-deal-and-did-not-gain-wear-from-dishwasher-cleaning">Great deal and did not gain wear from dishwasher cleaning</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this pack for my 12 month old twins. They are good quality thick plastic that is BPA free. My twins have not used them yet themselves as they are still in the throwing phase but I use the bowls to mix yogurt and the plates to serve their blueberries, etc. I mostly wash them by hand as I use them multiple times per day but I have run them through the dishwasher and they did not appear to gain more wear from it. These were a great deal and should last for quite some time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-children-s-dishes-in-bright-patterns">Sturdy children&rsquo;s dishes in bright patterns!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are my go-to dishes for all of my nanny children. After having to throw out all of my old plastic ware due to peeling and general age, I am very impressed with this sturdy children&rsquo;s dish set. I especially like the shape of the bowls. They are large enough for snacks without being too big, and their shape allows easy gripping for toddlers. The cute fish designs are fun. I can assign a color to each child and have a matching cup, which makes my life easier. I know there are dozens of sippy type cups on the market, but I like these tumblers and they double as snack cups too. I&rsquo;ve washed them in the dishwasher dozens of times so far and they look as good as new.</p>

<h5 id="annabella-approved-and-tested-4-yrs-old">Annabella approved and tested (4 yrs old)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My four year old was very excited to see a package from Amazon. I explained it was for her, but not a toy. I helped her open the box and she was super excited to see the new plates, bowls and cups. The fish design on the all the items had her very excited and she sorted them out by color. Of course her favorite was the pink, but she loved them all. I washed them and she immediately wanted to try them out. I am hesitant to give her cups with no lids, but the wide base gave me confidence to give it a try. She has no used the sets multiple times and there have been no spills. The wide base on the cup helps keep it upright and the dishes are easy to wash.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-them">Love them!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids love all the different colors, the cups are perfect size for a drink for toddlers and teaching them how to use a real cup over sippy cups. They aren&rsquo;t really see through as the picture suggests&hellip;but still cute! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-satisfied">Very Satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great set. The cups are the perfect size for my two year old who is still getting the hang of drinking without a lid. I don&rsquo;t ever fill them more than half way though since she tends to hurriedly tip her glass and pour it on herself. Plates and bowls work just fine too, and have held up to microwaving, going through the dishwasher, and even some light cutting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-set">Pretty set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This feeding set is so colorful. They&rsquo;re adorable! My daughter loves them. Only complaint is that grease can stick to it so I have to double/triple wash sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-the-perfect-size-for-toddlers">They are the perfect size for toddlers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 3 year old loves these dishes! They are the perfect size for toddlers. The cups are the perfect transition size between sippy cups and regular cups, in addition, the plates&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-toddlers">Great for Toddlers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for toddlers. Size is small (plate is about the size of a desert plate) but bowls are deep. Very easy to clean and durable. A great buy for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the colors and details of these cups, plates and bowls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-microwave-safe">Not Microwave Safe</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Claims to be microwave safe, but sparked while I was heating after only 15 seconds! Fine set, cute colors and lightweight, but not what I needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for the grandkiddo&rsquo;s!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-our-purchase">Happy with our purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple but effective for out 21 month old. It&rsquo;ll be great as she continues to grow and she loves the colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this quick and easy set. Use them almost daily!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Kids love it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Gets the job done</p>
