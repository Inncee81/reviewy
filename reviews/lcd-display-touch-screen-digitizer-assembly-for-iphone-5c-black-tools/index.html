<h5 id="and-it-is-super-hard-to-clean-it-off">and it is super hard to clean it off</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be careful when ordering these replacement screens&hellip; it took me a couple of tries to get the right one!There are a lot of screens that are just the glass, but what I didn&rsquo;t realize was that with the iPhone (as opposed to the iPad), the glass is glued to the digitizer, and it is super hard to clean it off. It&rsquo;s doable, but really fiddly&hellip; and the slightest crack to the digitizer, and it&rsquo;s game over!I ordered this one, because the digitizer is already attached&hellip; BUT it&rsquo;s important to know that it&rsquo;s not a full assembly. You still need to transfer the speaker and home button from your old screen. It doesn&rsquo;t come with instructions, but there are quite a few instructional videos on YouTube.If you don&rsquo;t mind tedious, fiddly projects, you&rsquo;ll do just fine! It took me about half a hour to the whole thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-is-a-bit-random-or-maybe-poor-packaging">Quality is a bit random, or maybe poor packaging.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the first one, the screen glass was fine, but when temporarily powered up it was clear the LCD had been cracked. This one had arrived in two layers of thin bubble wrap and then inside an Amazon bubble pouch mailer. It could have either been faulty manufacturing or broke during shipping. The replacement was from a different vendor, but still fulfilled by Amazon. It was clearly the same screen and tools, but this one was in a snap close plastic bubble pack and then inside an Amazon bubble pouch mailer. The second worked just fine. If I was to do it over again, I would still buy this, but the seller and/or Amazon should do better to protect during shipping. I would also probably buy a new home button kit vs reusing the old one as they are fragile and easily torn when removed (mine didn&rsquo;t). There are no instructions included, but there is good how to YouTube videos on doing the replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-and-easy-to-replace-yourself">Works great and easy to replace yourself!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! If you get the white lines and cant use the touchscreen like some of the reviews say, then the screen isn&rsquo;t plugged in correctly. All you have to do to fix it is unplug and reconnect the ribbons, and once it&rsquo;s in correctly it should work fine</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-it-looks-good-but-if-i-had-to-do-it-again">It works, it looks good, but if I had to do it again&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen worked, but if I had to do it again, I wouldn&rsquo;t! As can be seen in the photos, it is necessary to relocate your old home button to the new screen - remove two screws and carefully remove the cable held in place with adhesive, then reinstall in the new screen. That&rsquo;s not the hard part, though. This model also requires you to remove your old camera, proximity sensor, speaker, light filter, camera mounting bezel, proximity bezel, and their respective miniature gaskets, and place them all back onto the new face plate, without ripping the cable attached to the digitizer. In the way my daughter broke her screen, the camera holder was already in pieces (the camera still worked fine, though). The proximity holder broke when I tried to remove it. I can&rsquo;t imagine the frustration of trying to glue these two pieces back in place by hand, considering the size of the pieces and the minute tolerances to make everything fit correctly. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t see why these replacements don&rsquo;t already have these small clear plastic items factory installed. I gave up on my &ldquo;fragments&rdquo;, and reassembled the phone without them. It seems to work fine now, but if it fails, I&rsquo;ll just order a screen with the &ldquo;small parts&rdquo; already installed. I wish I had known the difference before tackling this project. It would have saved me a LOT of frustration and time. The pre-assembled unit would have only required me to remove two screws to open the case, then 4 screws over the cable retainer. From there, pop off the three cables, then reassemble in reverse - so much easier and faster, as in minutes, not hours. (HINTS - there is no need to remove the SIM card. Also, if you want to disconnect the battery, you can remove just one screw and loosen the other, then swivel the battery cable clip out of the way; much easier to reinstall that way. Some repair videos don&rsquo;t show disconnecting the battery at all, but I was being cautious.) Over the years, I&rsquo;ve replaced a lot of camera, phone, and laptop screens. This screen replacement ranked as one of the harder ones, and needlessly so.</p>

<h5 id="worked-better-than-expected">Worked better than expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great, came with even more tools than necessary. (What was the guitar pick for?? lol)I think most of the negative reviews come from people who didn&rsquo;t realize how much work was involved. If you watch one of those repair videos that&rsquo;s only three minutes you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. Its a little more involved than that, as you have to move the ear speaker, camera, home screen button, etc.This video is a much more accurate representation of the work that has to be done:[&hellip;]The screws are TINY (not the seller&rsquo;s fault) so I would recommend ordering extras in case you drop one. Other than the microscopic inner workings of the iphone, it was easy and I didn&rsquo;t run into any snags. Definitely recommend. Way cheaper than going to a repair shop.</p>

<h5 id="worked-for-a-short-time">Worked for a short time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen worked great when I first installed. After about 5 months, it suddenly just completely quit working. I am going to replace the screen once again, but will find a different one on Amazon to buy this time. For $20, you get what you pay for. I&rsquo;d rather pay more and have a screen last longer than 5 months. The screen also had lines going through it. It wasn&rsquo;t too noticeable, though. The colors definitely were not as vibrant as the original screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-as-described-you-ll-have-to-swap-some-parts">Exactly as described. You&rsquo;ll have to swap some parts &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EDITA few hours after installing, the left side of the display quit accepting touch commands. I can see, but cannot select those apps or dial numbers 1, 4 and 7.The package had a nice note from the seller indicating they would solve any problem that I had if I would contact them directly, but it had no contact information printed on it. If they contact me and resolve the issue, I will edit the review accordingly.ORIGINAL REVIEWExactly as described. You&rsquo;ll have to swap some parts from the old screen.My advice: watch a few videos on your tube. Also, have a system for keeping tiny screws in order.</p>

<p>I ordered this and my dog ate the package. Ordered a second one, had no issues putting it on my phone and it works great. No issues. Very pleased.</p>

<p>Best bang for the buck. If you don&rsquo;t have a warranty and can follow a YouTube video, you can replace your broken iPhone screen for less than $20 forever with this product.</p>
