<h5 id="great-value-but-be-realistic">Great value but be realistic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s good&hellip;really good for the money, but you should know a few things before you buy this item. I&rsquo;ve owned Bose docking stations and I&rsquo;ve tested the Bose Soundlink as well, and the Vtin isn&rsquo;t even close in sound. But, the price difference is enormous so it&rsquo;s not a fair comparison. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the Vtin:POSITIVES:- It gets very loud for it&rsquo;s size. It will easily fill a large room with sound or a garage/shop.- It is extremely portable.- It&rsquo;s pretty tough, but the grills probably will dent easily if dropped.- The Bluetooth connects very easily and has great range.- The sound is good for the money.- The battery life is exceptional.- Has a convenient carabiner hanger so you can hang it on a hook in the garage or in the backyard.- It&rsquo;s splash proof so it&rsquo;s great for by the pool or while washing cars.- Has a headphone jack and works very well as a computer speaker as well.- Love the size (7&rdquo; x 2.75&rdquo; x 2&rdquo;). Just big enough to be loud yet very easy to grab with one hand and carry.NEGATIVES:- Not great low end tones like the Bose SoundLink and distorts a bit at high volumes. Overall it&rsquo;s still really good, but be realistic about the quality of the sound at this price point.- The lowest volume setting with an iPhone connected is still pretty loud, so if you like super quiet background music at the desk, this may not work.In summary, for the price I&rsquo;m not sure you can do much better than this. I&rsquo;m really pleased with what I got for the money, but if you&rsquo;re super particular about sound quality then I&rsquo;d recommend you pay the additional 100-150 bucks to get something a bit more high end.Hope that helps.</p>

<h5 id="great-speaker-great-company">Great speaker great company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off I want it known I bought and paid for this speaker full price with no incentives. With that being said I would have to say this is way more speaker than what you pay for. I run heavy equipment and like to listen to music to pass this day. It is really hard to find a speaker that can be heard over the roar of a CAT diesel and man this thing does it. I will say I had a problem with the charging port, BUT I contacted the manufacturer via email and sent a picture of the port&hellip;5 days later a brand new speaker was delivered no question asked. They stand behind their product which happens to be a great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-speaker">Great speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sounding speaker for the size and price ($42) It&rsquo;s a quality build, very durable and waterproof without looking ugly. I would definitely buy this again and highly recommend it. This also connected to every bluetooth device I have, even an older asus 7&rdquo; tablet and 1st gen moto-g had no problem connecting.</p>

<h5 id="plunged-it-into-ocean-lagoon-ocean-all-just-fine">Plunged it into ocean lagoon ocean - all just fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live here in the Marshall Islands (all atolls in central Pacific Ocean), and I go fishing. Several days ago, while on a small boat fishing, fellow fishermen couldn&rsquo;t believe this great-sound speaker could be waterproof. While music was still on, I said to one of the fishermen to test it, blunge it into the ocean of the lagoon. He did a few times. Everyone was speechless, as great local music was still playing as we continued sailing back home.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-fantastic-speaker-regardless-of-price">This is a fantastic speaker, regardless of price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fantastic speaker, regardless of price, but the price is GREAT! I actually ordered another one. The battery life is extensive and the range is awesome. It says 30 feet, but I have used it in my back yard at greater distances and it still sounds good. We use this in the back yard for our TV on the patio and the sound is very clear and strong. I bought one for the house and i think I will be getting another one to keep in my work space in the garage. I don&rsquo;t post reviews often, but I read them and value when people take the time to do it. I highly recommend this product and the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-like-this-speaker">I really like this speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my wife. She uses hers in the kitchen mostly, and loves it. It is easily audible over the noise of appliances and vent fans, and sounds very decent doing it. I use mine at work, and the same goes for me. It fills the shop I work in, and honestly even has to be turned down to be able to carry on a conversation with co-workers. All while sounding good. While I don&rsquo;t think it resembles Bose quality sound, it also doesn&rsquo;t carry that hefty Bose price-tag! For a Bluetooth speaker under $50.00, with good sound and a great battery life, you cannot go wrong!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-speaker">Very good speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This speaker is great! I read many reviews before choosing this speaker and I have to say it definitely met all expectations. A couple features I especially like are the Bluetooth range that it has, you can walk pretty far away from this thing with your phone without it cutting out. And the ability to change songs from the speaker is super handy when listening to it in the shower or wherever there&rsquo;s light moisture without getting your phone wet.</p>

<h5 id="good-speaker-terrible-feedback-when-charging-and-using-aux">Good Speaker, Terrible Feedback When Charging and Using AUX</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little speaker. I mostly use it to listen to music from my phone or computer. For a small speaker, the sound is pretty good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-speaker-for-the-price">Great speaker for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far recommend this speaker. Easy to connect to bluetooth, light and portable. Of course not bose quality but what do you expect&hellip;it does the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="satisfied-reviews-were-spot-on">satisfied reviews were spot on</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading a bunch of reviews on waterproof Bluetooth speakers in this general price range, I decided to go with this one. The positive, satisfied reviews were spot on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great so far. Have used every weekend and some weekdays on patio. Battery life is excellent, handled all day parties with no problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tough-and-loud-little-speaker-for-outdoor-use-or-in-the-shower">Tough and loud little speaker for outdoor use or in the shower!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little speaker for the money. I wanted something tough enough and loud enough to be used while riding my Polaris RZR. This speaker worked perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for-and-not-what-you-don-t">You get what you pay for and not what you don&rsquo;t</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a lesson in you get what you pay for. I was tempted by widely reviewed more expensive products but I read good thongs about the vtin and a nice price so I tried it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-very-long-but-very-annoying-when-trying-to-enjoy">Not very long but very annoying when trying to enjoy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have given speaker 5 stars but recently it started to randomly cut out for a brief period of time. Not very long but very annoying when trying to enjoy music</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-speaker">I love this speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this speaker. I put my iPhone into a waterproof case, hooked the speaker to my life vest and off I went on my jet ski!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great customer Service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very loud probably the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I&rsquo;ve tested. I did have a problem where mine stopped working but they quickly replaced it and I&rsquo;m back up and running.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-time-or-money">don&rsquo;t waste your time or money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>can barely hear it. my son has a old polaroid that&rsquo;s five years old &amp; is 50% louder.</p>
