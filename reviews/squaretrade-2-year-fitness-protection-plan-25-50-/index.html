<h5 id="they-treated-daily-usage-as-accident-hence-nothing-is-covered">They treated daily usage as accident hence nothing is covered.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this SquareTrade 3-year warranty about 1.5 years ago for a Schwinn 430 elliptical. A few days ago a screw of the handle bar was broken and stuck inside the bar hence I believe the whole bar needs to be replaced. I filed a claim with SquareTrade and was told the claim is denied. I asked the reason and was told that &ldquo;the part was broken during usage hence it was an accident thus is not covered&rdquo;. I asked them, then, what is covered. They said that &ldquo;only defect parts&rdquo;.OK. So, if everything runs fine at the beginning, there will be no defect parts, hence afterward anything broken will be counted as &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and will be no coverage. They also refused to refund my warranty fully.Good luck if you want to buy such a s***.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-bother-purchasing-for-workout-equipment">Don&rsquo;t Bother Purchasing For Workout Equipment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother purchasing this for workout equipment. I bought an elliptical, and after about 6 months of using it one of the metal pieces holding the pedal together snapped in half. I put in a claim, which was instantly denied. I called to see what the issue was, and apparently the broken metal piece is &ldquo;considered an accident and not a defect part.&rdquo; Which makes absolutely no sense to me. A piece of metal snaps right in half while using this machine and it&rsquo;s not considered a defect?? Okay.I even asked if I could have a replacement part so I could fix it myself. Nope. Terrible experience. Will not be purchasing again.</p>

<h5 id="a-customer-service-very-good-experience-with-a-little-bit-of-a-wait">A+ Customer Service, Very Good Experience, with a Little Bit of a Wait</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this Exerpeutic Folding Bike on November 30th, 2014. I also purchased this SquareTrade Protection Plan in that same transaction (they sent it in a separate email about 90 minutes later&hellip; no registration or setup was required). While I loved the bike, I had three issues crop up in relatively short order. I suffered a broken pedal strap; broken pedal strap mount; and an odd whirring followed by a clicking noise with each revolution at intervals over “5” on the dial.When the pedal apparatus broke, I called SquareTrade at (877) 927-7268 to see what they could do to resolve/repair the bike&rsquo;s issues. I&rsquo;m pleased to say that the representative I spoke with (Anthony in Pakistan) was exceptionally kind and professional. I reported my concerns with the product, and after he asked me a brief series of questions (including tracking down the equipment&rsquo;s Serial Number, and emailing him a copy of the original electronic invoice), he determined that—as my bike&rsquo;s manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty had expired—I was due a full refund of the purchase price.He presented three options for the credit. Note that tax was not refunded in any of these options:1) I could receive the amount of my original purchase back via PayPal.2) I could receive the amount of my original purchase back + 2% via an Amazon eGift card.3) I could receive the amount of my original purchase back via Check (sent by snail mail).I chose Option 2, as I fully intend to buy another bike from Amazon&hellip; getting back 2% on top of that was just icing on the cake. Once I notified the CSR of my preference, he emailed me an affidavit to sign and date. Anthony stayed on the line with me while I printed, scanned, and emailed it back to him. He put me on a brief hold to confirm accuracy and receipt and then confirmed moments later that we were all set. I was told that I should see the Amazon eCredit in my personal email account within 1-3 days.This really has to be one of the best customer service experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had. I’ll note that the wait/hold time to get to an agent was really long (10+ minutes), though their automated system did advise that I could alternately file my claim on their website (attached image). I always prefer to speak with an agent whenever possible, and I&rsquo;m glad I did. As to those reviewers whose experiences were “less than positive,” I suspect that has a lot to do with frustration regarding the overlap period between when a product still under the maker&rsquo;s warranty and SquareTrade’s. I&rsquo;ve been there too (with a vacuum from Target&hellip; don&rsquo;t get me started!)All told, I spent $160.18 for the bike (including tax); $14.79 for the Warranty; and I should receive back an Amazon GC for $151.98… bringing my out-of-pocket expense for eight months of biking to $22.99. As I move forward with my decision on which bike to replace this one with, I will ABSOLUTELY be buying another SquareTrade warranty, I can only recommend that you do the same!Update (08/14/15): A week went by and I hadn&rsquo;t yet seen my reimbursement. Yesterday evening, I contacted Anthony back via email, and he said that he would investigate. This morning, I had an email from SquareTrade with an Amazon credit code of $152.04.Feel free to leave me a comment or question, I’m happy to add anything else you’d like to know about the product. Thanks for taking the time to read my review, hopefully this information was useful!READ MORE</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had to use the warranty on this purchase, but I have had Square Trade in the past, and they are extremely reliable, they don&rsquo;t have all kinds of hidden fees when you make a claim, and they pay out when needed without a hassle.</p>

<h5 id="not-worth-it">Not Worth It</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This plan only applies if the equipment malfunctions or is broken. I found the exercise cycle&rsquo;s performance to be subpar, but I do not think the plan would expect to refund the cycle&rsquo;s purchase price. I should have saved my money instead of buying the plan.</p>
