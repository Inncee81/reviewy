<h5 id="dragon-ball-super-receives-a-pretty-super-blu-ray">Dragon Ball Super receives a pretty super Blu Ray</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dragon Ball Super is styled as a semi-sequel to Dragon Ball Z. Technically, it takes place during a ten-year gap that occurs in the last few episodes of Dragon Ball Z. It originally aired in Japan beginning in the summer of 2015. The dub started airing on Cartoon Network in January of 2017. Dragon Ball Super is a fun, if flawed, show. It has plenty of callbacks for fans of Dragon Ball Z, and a strong dub make this release worth checking out.EPISODE CONTENTSFor those who have not followed Dragon Ball lately, Dragon Ball Super begins with two sagas that retell and expand the stories of two very recent Dragon Ball Z movies, &ldquo;Battle of Gods&rdquo; and &ldquo;Resurrection F.&rdquo; This set contains episodes 1-13, which is most of the Battle of Gods story arc. Episode 14 is the conclusion of that arc, but it is being held off until Part Two. While fans may be annoyed at this omission, in fairness to Funimation, 13-episode sets are pretty standard for anime, and for a long-running series like Dragon Ball Super (which currently has more than 100 episodes), breaking it into 13-episode releases is generally the norm.Those who saw Battle of Gods will note that the animation quality of the first 13 episodes is a pretty huge drop from the higher-budget animation of the feature film. While it does not look bad, the animation&rsquo;s quality dip is noticeable by comparison. When the show aired in Japan, some episodes were even worse. This Blu Ray uses the video from the Japanese Blu Ray, which was cleaned up prior to release, so it looks better than it did when the episodes first aired on TV in 2015, but not great. As those who have been watching the series know, the animation quality gets much better after the first 30 or so episodes, so at least there is something to look forward to in the future.The other thing that is somewhat unique is that because Battle of Gods exists as a film, there are several extra scenes and episodes in this set that feel more like anime filler. Some of them are fun additions, such as the slice of life first half of episode 2 involving Vegeta begrudgingly taking his family on a vacation. Other additions, such as expanding Goten and Trunks&rsquo; presence, can get grating after a while. The film is generally better than its Super adaptation.What is here is good fun, especially for long-time fans of the series. There is some great action, there are some genuinely funny moments, and it feels great to just settle in and watch some Dragon Ball again.SUB/DUBSomewhat notoriously, the Dragon Ball Z dub was oftentimes very different from the Japanese original. The entire score was changed, character names were altered, and characterization tended to be different. When Funimation dubbed Dragon Ball Kai (Z Kai in North America), it took a much more faithful approach to the series while retaining most of the original cast.Today, Funimation is a very different company and is in a very different place than it was in 1999-2003 when Dragon Ball Z originally aired on TV. Dragon Ball Super received a faithful dub. It is interesting to watch the show with Japanese subtitles on to compare the lines being spoken in the dub to the lines from the original show. In Z, they were often different, whereas in Super, they are largely identical. Additionally, the cast is superb. While some fans will always prefer the original cast to the dub cast, all of the dub actors and actresses do a great job with their parts. Newcomers Jason Douglas and Ian Sinclair, who voice Beerus and Whis, respectively, are perfectly cast (as they were in the Battle of Gods film). Otherwise, the dub cast from Kai carried over to Super, and everyone does an excellent job with their parts. Whether you prefer Masako Nozawa or Sean Schemmel as Goku, the performances surrounding your preferred way of watching the show are a highlight of this set. Lastly, as expected of Funimation, the subtitles for the Japanese version are perfect. I believe they are a little more accurate than the Crunchyroll subtitles, but I have not compared the two enough to know for sure. Either way, they offer an accurate translation.THE BLU RAYThis is a pretty typical Funimation Blu Ray, which is definitely a good thing. It has a shiny slip case that looks really nice. There are two discs, one consisting of 9 episodes and the other consisting of 4 and the extras. The episode listing is behind the first disc on the back of the Blu Ray insert. There are not any physical extras with this release.The menus are clean and easy to navigate, with some animation from across the 13 episodes in this set playing on the top half of the screen and standard menu options on the bottom. There is also a Marathon Mode option, which omits the openings and endings and just plays the substance of the episodes.The video and sound quality are great. Having just finished watching the Buu Saga of Kai, I noticed that the sound seems to be mixed a little better in Super. The video quality is crisp and clean, animation quality aside.EXTRASThere are two extras on this set, which are sets of interviews with the dub cast about returning to Dragon Ball. The cast has been voicing these characters in games and recently in the two movies, so they were not really &ldquo;returning&rdquo; to Dragon World, per se, but the interviews and insights are still fun. These individuals are all experienced panelists at anime conventions, so they are great on camera. While there is not anything particularly special about these interviews, they&rsquo;re a good Blu Ray extra to check out. Chris Sabat&rsquo;s daughter is absolutely adorable in her extra with him.SUMMARYDragon Ball Super has finally begun receiving a home release, and it is (thankfully) exactly what fans would want. Fans of the Japanese version get a great package with an excellent subtitle track. Fans of the dub get a well-written, well-acted dub of the show. The contents of this particular release, frankly, do not surpass the 2013 Battle of Gods movie. However, Funimation did a great job with what it had and has turned out a fantastic dub and an equally fantastic Blu Ray release of Super. For fans of Super, this is definitely worth checking out.For fans of Z who have maybe fallen out of Dragon Ball fandom over the years, I would also recommend Super. Unlike GT, Super tends to feel more like late-Z material, and the action gets pretty good later in the series&rsquo; run. In fairness, Parts 1 and 2 of Super are really skippable in favor of their movie counterparts. That said, some of the extra material in the episodes is a lot of fun. If you like hanging out with the Dragon Ball characters, and haven&rsquo;t done so in twenty years since Z ended, this is a great way to fall back in love with Dragon Ball all over again. It&rsquo;s fun, sometimes silly, with great action, and is receiving a dub that is on par with how the Funimation of today localizes anime. It&rsquo;s worth watching, and if you see something here you like, it&rsquo;s most definitely worth sticking with going forward.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to hear these voice actors after so long! These first few episodes of DB Super are a good start to the series, even if it is a retelling of Battle of Gods. I can&rsquo;t wait to get the rest in English when they come out</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as the show goes its great. Even though it retells the events of the last two movies I still thought that they made the story different enough to a point where it was worth watching even though you already knew the main plot points of the show from the movie.The animation in the show looks great. Seeing Dragon Ball in 2017 is a sight to behold with all the quality of anime improving since the end of Dragon Ball Z in 1996. It really shows with the fight scenes and Goku has never looked so good in his Bright Red Super Saiyan God form that he has for most of the season.Another big aspect is the English Dub. It&rsquo;s fantastic to say the least. You can tell the voice actors had a heck of a time reprising their roles and each actor does a great job. The writing for the dub is hilarious as well, adding in references that long time fans of the franchise will understand and love.Now comes the negative with this product itself. It&rsquo;s missing the season finale of the show. Needless to say that is a total bummer. You can tell it is a total business tactic to get into buying the next set to see the finale of this arc. It just feels wrong and cheap on Funimation&rsquo;s end. The last few episodes of this season build you up to a point where you are sitting there like, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this going to end?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo; and you can&rsquo;t find out because it&rsquo;s missing that episode. Which leaves you saying, &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to buy the next set&hellip;..&rdquo; which is what Funimation wants you to do. I&rsquo;m sure Funimation will make an excuse by stating this set is called &ldquo;Part One&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Season One&rdquo; as the main reason to why the episode is omitted. Because of this reason you may want to wait till the set after this one comes out so you can at least have a fair amount of episodes ready to watch if you haven&rsquo;t seen them before but even the set after this will be omitting the season finale of Season Two as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great to see some new Dragon Ball anime coming out and have to say so far it&rsquo;s a great start though I know it&rsquo;s right now a stretched out story-arc of the movie DBZ:BOTG the animation actually seems better here in the series then it was in the movie which is pretty ironic. Though it&rsquo;s a little sad to see some of the longtime English dub voices for these characters not coming back to reprise their roles like Laura Bailey for the voice of Trunks though kudos to Alexis Tipton doing a great job voicing that role now though Kara Edwards does reprise her role as Goten and of course there a few other voice cast that have been replaced with new voice actors/actresses though very talented ones so there&rsquo;s no complaint on that part. The animation and soundtrack are great and fans are sure to enjoy this newest release of DBZ for us to enjoy and hopefully Funimation will be releasing more of these sets soon for fans to add to their shelf anime collection.</p>
