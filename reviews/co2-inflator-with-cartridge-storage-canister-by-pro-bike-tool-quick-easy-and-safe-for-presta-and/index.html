<h5 id="so-you-re-looking-for-a-quality-co2-inflation-tool-eh">So&hellip; you&rsquo;re looking for a quality CO2 inflation tool, eh?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed&hellip; that I didn&rsquo;t buy MORE of these to give away as quality gifts when they were priced at rock bottom prices! Not too long ago on a solo ride, I was forced to use my compact, spring-switch activated CO2 inflator since I neglected to bring along a mini pump. With little to no real control over the inflation with a CO2 canister, it was a dismal affair on the side of the road. So, that night, I checked Amazon and came across the Pro Bike Tool CO2 inflator. What I liked about it was the fact the Presta/Schrader (it has a twin valve head) connection is a screw-on attachment to the valve, AND it has a controlled release lever, from &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; to &ldquo;Open&rdquo; position, and is variable dependent on how much you turn the lever. It&rsquo;s that simple! I gave it a test run on a recycled/patched tube (700x18-25), and I have to say, it was a total waste of time as well as a perfectly good CO2 cartridge. Of course it worked! Why wouldn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinkin&rsquo;&hellip; it was, however, nice to see how easy it was to control the CO2 airflow rate.If there&rsquo;s one minor thing I could complain about (believe me, it&rsquo;s trivial and you could skip the next couple sentences if you&rsquo;d like), it&rsquo;s when storing the CO2 cartridge. I use a 16g cartridge (it&rsquo;s designed to be safely stored upside down in the canister), it rattles a bit since I keep it in a tool storage container in my water bottle holder. I did a little hack and cut a small 2&rdquo; strip of leftover butyl inner tube and placed it loose, lengthwise within the container. That did the trick, but ultimately, it&rsquo;s a minor thing and if you&rsquo;re used to carrying such road tools in your jersey back pocket, you&rsquo;ll hardly notice the rattling. I added a few pics and I think they&rsquo;re fairly self-explanatory, but I just wanted to add that I&rsquo;m NOT a weight weenie. Yes, I own a digital scale, but that&rsquo;s for my reloading hobby&hellip; the weight was included in this review for those that just want to know. So, a total of 59 grams, that&rsquo;s just under 2.1 oz, and without the CO2 cartridge. Awesome, in my opinion. I think Pro Bike Tool has an absolute winner here.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-tool-and-works-great">Fantastic tool and works great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works fantastic. I had one of those flat tires that would say inflated for a whole day of riding and the next morning it would be out. I bought this to carry for emergencies or in case I was injured and couldn&rsquo;t use my manual pump but still needed to refill the tire and get somewhere. I&rsquo;ve been stranded 15 miles away with a flat tire.. never again. This is well made and works great. Now I carry this and 2 empty cartridges in case. I think it is a little pricey for what it is, but I rate it a 5 star because it is high quality and works great. There are also no comparable alternatives, so I&rsquo;m happy.My first use: Using a whole cartridge took about a minute and filled up good enough to be able to ride my bike around. This isn&rsquo;t meant for filling up a new tire and using it for good, it&rsquo;s meant for filling it up enough to get you somewhere to fill up with air, since CO2 leaks quicker.. but that means it won&rsquo;t stay filled for months. It will definitely stay filled all day of riding so once you get somewhere with air you can fill it up then.</p>

<h5 id="really-a-well-made-product">Really a well made product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the better products you will ever find on the bike tools market. I wanted a CO-2 nozzle that was small, yet had the lever to control the amount of air going into my tires. I also wanted something as small as possible, as space/weight is limited on triathlon bikes.This product checks off every need. The machining work is impeccable, and this is not a cheaply made product. A CO-2 canister will fit, upside down, perfectly inside the tube, and there is an indention in the bottom with a small rubber grommet to hold the canister in place. When you screw the top on, it presses it in place, with no rattling at all. And the whole thing is smaller in diameter than if you had one of those foam sleeves over your canister. If/when you need to use it, simply unscrew the top, the canister slides right out, turn it right side up and screw it into the top cap. It punctures automatically, and doesn&rsquo;t leak. Screw the tube back on, and you have some protection against the freeze when you dispel the air. The nozzle screws onto your valve as well, so no leakage. The nozzle itself can be unscrewed and reversed for Presta or Schrader valves. The valve goes from closed to fully open in about a quarter turn.I used this without gloves, and although the sleeve and nozzle do get cold (mostly the nozzle), I was able to hold the sleeve without it getting too cold to hold. I&rsquo;d probably recommend using a glove or a rag if you&rsquo;re concerned about that.Really a well made product. We bought two, and I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this as a great addition to your bike repair kit.</p>

<h5 id="well-made-very-efficient-tool">Well made very efficient tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made and great working inflator. You won&rsquo;t loose one pound of air with this tool. Works quickly, easy to use, and will the ability to store a cartridge in the canister is a plus. No waisted space in your seat bag. Its like having a free canister with you. I would highly recommend this Tool if you want a light weight, easy to use, professional made inflator.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="look-no-further">Look no further!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked at many different CO2 inflators before deciding on this particular one. The piece that attaches to the valve actually screws down to create a better seal during inflation. Also, the CO2 is housed inside the container, keeping your hands away from a soon-to-be very cold, empty CO2 cartridge. This is perhaps the best CO2 inflator available.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="used-for-motorcycle-tires">Used for motorcycle tires.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I use this for my motorcycle to &ldquo;top off&rdquo; the tires when I am camping nowhere near a gas station. I carry many cartridges with just in case of a real flat I can get the tire inflated enough to ride. They work great and it is even better that you can store a new 16g cartridge upside down and it is always handy. This item is of much better quality than other ones I have had and broken.FYI: I had to contact customer support, and they are FANTASTIC. I would buy from them again.Hope this helps! If so please click the &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; button, and if you have any question feel free to ask!</p>

<h5 id="a-reliable-co2-inflator-what-more-could-one-ask">A reliable co2 inflator. What more could one ask?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the better designed co2 inflators on the market, IMHO. At 64 I need an inflator I can trust out on the road fixing a flat.</p>

<p>First time I will ever use this device. As a biker, it is a must. Very satisfie for the quality and the look.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, my first impression when I opened the package was disappointment&hellip;.why? because I received the incorrect product - I ordered the one you see pictured with the metal&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">Works like a charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very smooth transaction. And although I had the misfortune of needing the product already, it worked perfectly and takes up very little space on my bike.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-good-works-great">Looks Good Works Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I needed to use this on the bike trail a couple days after I got it. Glad I had it, way faster than a hand pump for sure.</p>

<p>First time using any C02 to fill bike tires , my only issue up was making sure the CO2 cartridge was tightly screwed in ,when i twisted it on tighter it worked perfect .</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving a 4 star rating because I have not had the opportunity to use it yet, which is good thing&hellip; no flats.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t want to write a review until I used it and it did it&rsquo;s job. The top lever confused me for a moment being I expected only it to turn from open-close.</p>
