<h5 id="good-bet-but-suction-cup-was-a-dud">Good bet, but suction cup was a dud</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It worked perfectly and the screen is as good as the original, at least to my eye. I didn&rsquo;t even see the instructions until I was halfway through (they&rsquo;re underneath the new screen), I just followed an excellent fixez.com video on youtube. I watched it once all the way through, then followed along, pausing after each step to do it myself. It took about an hour, but I was being careful. Just make sure to keep track of the screws. I thought I was and ended up one short, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to affect the outcome.The only poor part of the kit is the suction cup. The one I received was as effective as using a piece of paper. My screen was shattered completely on one corner of the home button end (which is where you need to lift it), so I was able to lift it off just by prying it off with the guitar pick-like device after removing the pentalobe screws near the charging port. All the other tools were adequate for the job. There is a pliers-looking suction device I may order if I need to repair this or my husband&rsquo;s phone again. If it weren&rsquo;t for the suction cup, I would rate this 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-replaced-many-many-iphone-screens-for-friends">I have replaced many many iPhone screens for friends, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have replaced many many iPhone screens for friends, family and well&hellip;I&rsquo;m rough on phones. This one caught my eye, despite the slightly higher price, because a) it was pre-tested and b)shipped form the US. It was worth it.Other vendors I&rsquo;ve dealt with frequently sell defective screens. This one worked. Enough said.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three">Three</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked as it should. No problems only thing one can ask for more is magnetized screw drivers.I am writing this revised review. The product ie the display and the digitizer assembly has started malfunctioning in less than a month. I was not usng the phone after repair but with bad quality experience with iphone 5S display from this same vendor, i staeted using this phone only to experience poor digitizer performance. Unlikly to buy again even thogh the vendor has refunded the money for totally dead 5S display. This 5C display is marginally better but far from satisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">Worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this to replace my husbands iphone 5c screen. He broke his iphone 6 which we will have to pay the 200 phone deductible, so in a pinch I figured I should try and salavge the 5c. I watched a couple youtube videos and then searched amazon for screens and sifted through product reviews. I chose this one for price and least amount of dissapointing reviews. This comes with directions and tools. It was a success! Im happy I was able to replace it myself and saving money. I had no problems with the screen quality or packaging. I would totally buy again. this was my first attempt I&rsquo;ve never done a screen replacement before but like I said I would buy again if needed.</p>

<h5 id="broken-digitizer-and-cracked-screen-easy-fix">Broken Digitizer and Cracked Screen&hellip; Easy Fix!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had an iPhone 5c I gave my little brother that somehow he managed to get run over by a minivan. So he got a new phone and I was going to junk the phone but I wanted to give replacing the screen a go. The glass was wrecked and the digitizer was not responding. There were many sellers but weelpower seemed to have the highest reviews for the lowest price. I ordered this about last month (March 2017) and it has been working like new! The digitizer is completely responsive and colors seem super accurate! I was worried that the glass would crack during shipping like some previous screen protectors I had purchased, however, the contents were packaged carefully and it even came with the screwdriver. The installation was super easy, as long as you know what you&rsquo;re doing. Just look up iPhone screen replacement on youtube. I still use the phone today and have it now as a backup/remote for home lights and such and have had zero issues with the screen.Overall, an excellent quality product especially for the price!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-and-satisfying-to-fix-my-own-phone">Easy and satisfying to fix my own phone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The glass arrived fast, the instructions were clear and easy to follow. I was careful removing and replacing the data cables (most scary part!!) and the new screen works like new! I am very satisfied with the quality, the delivery and the price. Suggestion: use an egg carton and store each component and its screws in separate pockets&hellip;.if you drop one they&rsquo;re so small you may never find it~!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-described-looks-great-comes-with-good-tools-for-dyi">Works as described, looks great,comes with good tools for DYI</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the screen based on the many positive customer reviews and was not disappointed. The screen worked very well, fits perfectly, and looks great. The tools that came with in are adequate. The instructions are a bit sparse, but there are plenty of good videos on youtube, in particular how to transplant the home button, camera, and earpiece. It took about 30 min to swap the screen, and the phone was up and running again. Make sure not to lose any of the screws, and remember where they came from. They are tiny, and there are at least 4-5 different sizes.</p>

<h5 id="the-iphone-5c-digitizer-glass-replacement-assembly-worked-perfectly-using">The iPhone 5C digitizer glass replacement assembly worked perfectly using &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The iPhone 5C digitizer glass replacement assembly worked perfectly using the Weelpower product. The provided tools did the job disassembling/re-assembling the phone. Be sure and watch the available YouTube videos that cover the digitizer replacement process in detail.This product is the real deal in that it works once installed, and it makes replacing an iPhone digitizer screen assembly about a one hour ordeal.Thanks!Clarence Coleman</p>

<h5 id="the-shows-on-all-black-apps-or-back-drop-horrible">&hellip; the shows on all black apps or back drop horrible.</h5>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very satisfied with this screen. Installing it was a breeze. I will need to buy another one because, as of a few minutes ago, I actually dropped and shattered my phone screen&hellip;</p>

<p>great product! Easy ton install !</p>

<h5 id="worth-20-for-an-old-phone-but-nowhere-near-the-original">Worth $20 for an old phone, but nowhere near the original.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For a cheap fix for an older phone, this is just fine. Build quality seems alright and the installation was smooth (not my first rodeo).</p>
