<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Cannon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM</p>

<p>Designed to exceed expectations and ideal for video and still images alike, the new EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM marks a new standard for EF-S lenses. It features a refined Image Stabilization system that delivers up to four equivalent stops of shake correction throughout the zoom range; and offers a maximum magnification of 0.28x at the telephoto end, while remaining even more compact in size. This EF-S lens supports the Canon EOS Rebel T4i DSLR&rsquo;s Movie Servo AF feature for smooth and quiet continuous AF during movie shooting by utilizing a new six-group zoom system and the adoption of a stepping motor and focus mechanism. High-speed autofocus is achieved thanks to an Inner focusing system, high-speed CPU, and optimized AF algorithm. Appearing for the first time in a Canon lens is Dynamic IS (Movie Shooting Mode only) that uses a wide image stabilization correction range to help ensure steady video while shooting when walking.</p>

<p>Whether shooting movies or stills, image quality is phenomenal, with one UD and one PMo aspheric lens providing high resolution and high contrast images with reduced chromatic aberration throughout the zoom range. A 7 blade, circular aperture ensures beautiful, soft backgrounds and optimized lens coatings ensure excellent color with minimized ghosting and flare. A zoom ring lock even prevents the lens from accidently extending.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-do-everything-lens">Perfect &ldquo;Do Everything&rdquo; Lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a perfect &ldquo;do everything&rdquo; lens. Wide enough to get the big group shots, long enough to get distant subjects or tight close-ups. On my 7D, autofocus is very quick. I photographed a helicopter flying overhead, and the autofocus nailed <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> shots. Sharpness is also very good. This competes very well with the EF-S 15-85 (actually matches overall according to DxOMark), and also the EF-S 17-55 (only one point less according to DxOMark). The plus is that you get much more range! Of course, inside with low light is not this lens&rsquo; friend, but for most situations, this is going to stay on your camera more often.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-standard-zoom-lens-for-your-canon-body">Excellent standard zoom lens for your Canon body.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are using this lens (we have two of them) on a Canon 70D and 7D Mk II.We have a Sigma 18 to 250 mm 1:3.5-6.3 DC Macro OS HSM lens with which we were becoming increasingly unimpressed as a general walk around lens. The images seemed flat and lifeless somehow. This Canon lens is much much better. The images seem to jump out at you. This may be because the Canon camera body recognizes the lens and applies corrections to the image as a result. Whatever the reason this lens feels orders of magnitude better than the Sigma in resolution, contrast, bokeh and sharpness.Focus is very quick and silent (which can be disconcerting at first) and image quality is excellent. As has been pointed out by Tony Northrup and others, high resolution APS-C cameras can be very effective for sports photography since you get the multiplication factor (x1.6 in a Canon) and you can crop to get your picture and still get better resolution than a longer focal length lens on a full frame camera which has the same pixel count on a larger frame sensor. So do not be put off by the apparent short focal length at the zoom end of the range. Pair this with a dedicated macro lens and a wide angle lens for those really tight shots and you have a very good outfit to cover most situations.We love this lens and would thoroughly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="it-completes-me">It completes me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this to replace my old Canon EF 28-105 3.5-5.6. I have a Canon 70d and wanted something for a walkaround that had image stabilization. This fits the bill. plus gets wider and reaches out further. It&rsquo;s seems sharper, faster focus, and quieter. I bought it as used, but it was as new. I&rsquo;m guessing it came as a kit lens for someone. I added a lens hood and have a UV filter on the way. Anyway, it rounds out my lens package for photos and videos as I now have a Canon 10-18 mm, 18-135mm and 55-250mm, and the EF 50mm 1.8, all with the STM motors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-video-lens">Great video lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the holy grail of video lenses when paired with a camera with full time auto-focus in video such as the t4i. You will never hear this lens focusing in videos, unlike USM or standard focus lenses. This is a good all around lens to use for the casual photographer that also shoots video. There are better portrait lenses out there, but if you could only take one lens and had to shoot both stills and video, this would be the lens to take, provided that your camera is APS-C format. Full frame cameras will not support this or any other EF-S lens.</p>

<h5 id="this-lens-is-really-going-to-spoil-you">This lens is really going to spoil you&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally received my copy of the 18-135 STM lens. I went back and forth for a while deciding between this lens, the 15-85 and the 24-105. I eventually opted for this lens for three reasons. First, the lens is the newest available and I assumed Canon fixed the shortcomings of the previous 18-135 optically (along with the new stepping motor). Second, I really didn&rsquo;t need the extra 3mm on the wide end but I truly did need the extra 50mm on the tele end. Third, as a general walk-around lens, the weight was about 20% less than the 15-85 and about 30% less than the 24-105 which really does make a difference around your neck.Onto my experience(s). From what little I could read from the sparse reviews out there, this lens was suppose to be very close optically to the 15-85 (since I don&rsquo;t have a copy of the 15-85, I have to rely on MTF charts). There is some barrel distortion at 18mm, appox. the same as the 15-85 at 15mm, but it goes away very quickly on my copy between the 18-24 range. One thing I do like about this lens is there&rsquo;s plenty of space between the 18 and 24, it&rsquo;s not crammed together like other lenses on the wide end. The lens is a 3.5-5.6 aperture. In its progression you&rsquo;ll hit 4.0 in the 25-35mm range, 4.5 40-50mm range, 5.0 in the 55-80mm range and 5.6 from 85-135. On the 60D, be sure to load the peripheral illumination correction and chromatic aberration profile from Canon to eliminate any fall-off.Physically, this lens is bigger than I thought it would be (I don&rsquo;t know why I was expecting anything different really). It&rsquo;s about a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch shorter than the previous 18-135 and about a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch longer than the 15-85. Weight is about 1 oz more than the previous 18-135 and about 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> oz less than the 15-85. Diameter is roughly the same for all these lenses. The overall feel of this lens is superb. You really feel like it has enough heft to not be considered a plastic piece of junk but not so much that it creates a &ldquo;boat anchor&rdquo; feeling around your neck. The zoom ring is very nice and smooth along with the electronic manual focus ring. Both feel extremely upscale with the ribbing and ease of use. About the manual focus ring, you can over-ride AF anytime by half-pressing the shutter and rotating the MF ring (negating the need to flip the switch to MF each time you want to focus yourself).Performance (in my opinion) is stellar. The lens is EXTREMELY quiet while focusing and zooming (I would say audibly non-existent). Fluid is the best way to describe it. Everything flows in a way that makes you appreciate what the lens is doing, it&rsquo;s really a very refined, artistic, sensory appealing and tactile accomplishment (again, in my opinion). Zooming is fast. Focus is fast and spot-on. This lens focuses almost instantaneously. One thing that surprised me was the bokeh of this lens. I was expecting a kit lens 18-55 type of bokeh but I have to say this lens is VERY good (when I say VERY, I mean VERY close to prime). I am truly impressed! This lens is extremely sharp in the center, I have found it is sharp throughout the focal range and exceedingly sharp in the 35-85mm range. The lens profile will correct for any fall-off you might get in the corners. I have not found any color fringes yet although I haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;pixel-peeped&rdquo; a lot of the close-ups and I haven&rsquo;t had it for that long to begin with. Color balance is VERY good. I truly enjoy the warm/vivid colors this lens captures.In closing, this lens has exceeded my expectations in every way. I think this lens is a bargain in the $400-$500 price range (although the MSRP is $549.00). With the optics, build quality, and performance I believe it is probably the best value for a lens with it&rsquo;s focus range. Obviously prime lenses and L glass are going to trump this lens but for the price/performance/ergonomic ratios, good luck. Canon really has produced a winner here. Feel free to comment or ask if you have any specific questions about the lens&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="goodness-gracious-this-is-a-fine-lens">Goodness gracious, this is a FINE lens!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own a t4i and this is by far my favorite lens to use!Pros-Dynamic range with excellent performance on both ends on the spectrum&ndash;SHARP,-STM stepping motor technology for silent, and FAST focusing, you will be impressed. Great for video work!-Excellent build quality, this lens will last, and stand up to bumps without a problem-Full time manual with wide focusing ring-Only very minor chromatic aberration-4 stops of image stabilizationCons-Reduces to f5.6 quickly on zooming-Big? You may need to gain a little strength for all day shoots, but with this you will spend less energy changing lensesI recently took this on a 26mile hike in yosemite, and it produced stellar results! No chance I would trade it for another lens!5 stars!</p>
