<h5 id="installed-this-on-my-lenovo-m53-tiny-desktop-works-great">Installed this on my Lenovo M53 Tiny desktop, works great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my Lenovo M53 Tiny desktop because the CPU temperatures run hot on these. I couldn&rsquo;t use the included mounting kit because it would end up blocking the power plug, so I made a couple brackets and bolted it directly to the back. Without this, the CPU would creep up to 100°C when running @100% CPU (seti@home for example) and the CPU would throttle back to save itself. The onboard fans don&rsquo;t kick up to high speed until about 105°C, if you set the bios to run full speed, it sounds like a vacuum cleaner, and there&rsquo;s no room in the case to add another fan. So, after installing this, I ran seti@home at 100%, let the temp rise to 90°C, then turned on the fan to &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; mode, it immediately cooled down about 15°.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-cooling-system-for-laptops-easy-installation-fast-cooling">Amazing cooling system for laptops! Easy installation, fast cooling.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I have to say that I was skeptical about purchasing this off brand accessory for my laptop but after receiving it and installing it. I have to say that this is product is AWESOME!!!! My laptop cools down in seconds. I would recommend this to anyone running a high powered gaming laptop or anyone looking to keep their laptop cool which extends the live of the internal hardware.****<strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>*****Hi Everyone,I wanted to update my review on this laptop vacuum cooler. After using the product extensively, appropriately 120hours. This is the most amazing laptop cooler ever!!!!! The laptop I&rsquo;m using is a Toshiba Qosmio X70 running a 4th gen i7 and GTX 770m graphics card. Its a powerful laptop that generates alot of heat and has had major heating issues. After using this cooler, my laptop has not heated up and shut down once since I installed it. The palm rest on the laptop usually heats up and burns my palm and arm but the laptop stays cool through a full day of use. The optional manual speed control helps when playing videogames because it sucks out all the heat from the laptop in seconds. Again, I would recommend and purchase this product again.NOTE: Since the product uses USB to power the cooling system, the speeds at which the fan spins depends on the USB version. If the product is plugged into a USB 2.0. The fan won&rsquo;t spin at full speed. USB 3.0 allows the product to function at its full capacity. This isn&rsquo;t specified in the product description. Regardless, this product works wonders.Since I&rsquo;ve only been using this product for a couple of hours. I will update my review after I&rsquo;ve tested it for a longer period.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-fan-loving-how-cool-it-s-keeping-my-laptop">Awesome fan, loving how cool it&rsquo;s keeping my laptop.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is way better than a previous vacuum fan I ordered. I have been having problems with my laptop over heating (temps ranging anywhere from 85 C - 95 C when trying to multitask or play any games on it. It IS a gaming laptop, but those temps were messing with the performance so yeah, gaming not so great.) and really needed something to help pull the hot air out of the system, yet I also wanted to have the ability to continue using my 12 cell battery (which raises the back of the laptop, thus it is not allowed to sit flat like most other vacuum fans I saw require); as well as the an additional Cooling fan underneath the system.This fan allows both of those, while offering a superb performence for automatic fan speed, and the sound is no louder than the fan that is IN my laptop. At first I worried that, with the location of my vent, the mount would partially cover the intake air vent. I am extremely happy to say that is not the case, it does NOT obstruct the intake vent! The auto-speed is great and keeps the fan from staying at it&rsquo;s highest speed when not needed, the silicon cover gives it great suction capability and the &lsquo;arms&rsquo; hold onto the laptop firmly but not so firm as to really put any pressure on the case of the laptop. It is well worth the $26 it is listed for, as it can save hundreds of dollars damage that could be cause by overheating. (O.o, I would hate to loose everything on it due to that, especially when such a small device can help. I&rsquo;m thinking about purchasing a second one for my friend who also has an older laptop.)((P.S. I did notice that mine only came with two silicon sleeves. I forgot about that until I rechecked the box it came in, but it was no big deal as it has the one that fits my laptop, the other one would probably just stay in the box with the other one that does not fit my laptop. Yes I am still giving 5 stars, because that is the quality I feel this product has.I will update again in a few months to let y&rsquo;all know if it&rsquo;s still working the same or not.</p>

<h5 id="surprised-at-how-well-this-works">Surprised at how well this works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this item for my Acer Aspire E5-573 series laptop because it was overheating while playing video games; Wow and Warframe. After about 15 minutes of playtime my laptop would be extremely hot and the games would lag. I bought a $40 laptop fan from Target but it was terrible. I searched Amazon for a cheaper and better alternative and found this Opolar Laptop Cooler. I am VERY happy I found this. My boyfriend, who works in the IT industry and is self-proclaimed &lsquo;techie&rsquo;, was really skeptical about this cooling fan. Once it arrived and we tried it out he was truly impressed by how well it works.This is really easy to install and use. I imagine it will fit any size laptop as long as the vent is on the side or rear of the laptop. Package comes with various sizes of silicone shrouds, a USB cable for power and the mounting unit. There is no need to buy the extra mounts that are listed as a recommended item. Fan is pretty quiet except for the max setting. Max setting is a little loud but nothing to be upset about. I never use it on max setting anyway because the lower settings work just fine.The only negative feedback I have is that it isn&rsquo;t really a portable option in the sense that you can&rsquo;t use this and have the laptop sitting on your lap. You need to use your laptop on a hard, flat surface so that the cooling fan stays flush against the vent. The unit itself is very portable and I&rsquo;d rather pack this away than a large, clunky, plastic, lap-friendly cooling fan. I always use my laptop on my desk so this is not a drawback for me but I thought it was worth mentioning.Overall this is an awesome fan and I highly recommend it. You really won&rsquo;t be disappointed. I purchase from Amazon A LOT but rarely write reviews. I was so impressed with this gadget that I had to give my opinion.</p>
