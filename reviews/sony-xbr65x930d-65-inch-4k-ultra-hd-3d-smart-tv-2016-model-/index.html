<blockquote>
<p>I bought my last Sony in 2011, the Sony Bravia KDL55NX720 55-inch. It was my favorite tv I&rsquo;d ever purchased. I try to buy a new, close-to-top-of-the-line or Top-of-the-line every 10 years (My last Sony before that was purchased in 2002). However, I had been reading about 4K and HDR technology and watching the prices fall, then I seriously started looking at a new tv about 4 months ago when I realized a perfect gift to my brother and his wife would be my current Sony. 55&rdquo; was exactly the size they were looking for and my brother already loved the minimalist and sleek look of that tv.Enter the XBR65X930D. I first saw it in person in a big box store while visiting family and having an afternoon of nothing to do but go look at electronics. At first I had been considering some of the highly rated Samsung tvs out there but seeing them side by side changed my mind in an instant. Reading in-depth reviews and avforum threads sold me even further on it.I&rsquo;m a big fan of movies, games and shows. This tv has the perfect settings for all content I&rsquo;ve tested it out on to this point. The &ldquo;Game&rdquo; setting is perfect for Xbox One and PS4 games. The lag with game setting is almost nonexistent. I read one review that said 55ms but that is not true. This has to be in the 33ms range that CNet reported. I actually feel it&rsquo;s better than my old tv which was below 35ms. It turns off MotionFlow and Cinemotion automatically. (I turn it off on every setting exceptions being live sports, which it has a setting for that it auto switches off if you change to another channel or input).Cable HD and Blu-ray look fantastic, again with tweaks to the picture setting and turning off MotionFlow and Cinemotion.One of my favorite things is that it remembers your settings for each picture mode, specifically how you set it for each individual input. So if my Standard mode is different for Cable(HDMI3) than for watching a blu-ray on my Xbox One (HDMI1) or PS4 (HDMI 2) it remembers that, for EACH picture setting for EACH input. And once you turn MotionFlow and Cinemotion off they stay off!For live sports the tv actually notices and switches you to &ldquo;Live Football Mode&rdquo; if you are watching NFL. This is the only mode I keep MotionFlow and Cinemotion on for, I can deal with the commercials having the &ldquo;Soap Opera Effect&rdquo;. And my favorite sport is Real Football (soccer) in which there are no commercials. Win-win!Next, Android TV. Have no complaints with this. Everything works like a dream. I love the voice feature when searching youtube for 4k HDR content. I love all the apps on it so far and hope that just a few more will come. It connected with my Google account and phone in a breeze. Happy that they have handed the reins of the menus and SmartTV over to the new industry standard Android. Everything works with everything and Sony can focus on the picture technology, which is why we buy the product in the first place.I see a lot of people complaining about the Active 3D on this tv so I was expecting the worst but after watching Wreck-It-Ralph, Kubo and The Two Strings and Gravity, I am blown away with how much better they look than they did on my other Sony. The characters don&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;flat&rdquo; and in the foreground; there is true depth of field. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the old Sony does a great job but technology does advance doesn&rsquo;t it (even if this is the last 3D tv Sony ever put out, I&rsquo;m happy to enjoy it for as long as I own this puppy).Then the big one. HDR content. Holy wow. I am over the moon with this tv&rsquo;s capability. The vividness and depth are astounding, and at 65&rdquo; I feel immersed in whatever I&rsquo;m doing, be it nature demos in 4k HDR or racing around Australia in Forza Horizon 3. I have read at great length about the importance of HDR to the tv world. 4K is big but without HDR, I didn&rsquo;t see much reason for it (and the cost was prohibitive). So glad I waited for it to be &ldquo;standard&rdquo; in tvs. I spent an entire weekend watching Amazon Prime and Netflix HDR programming. It was stunning. I had to rewind the programs a lot cos I missed the dialogue while staring at the depth, clarity and detail. One thing I do have to do everyday is change the brightness setting as the sun goes down. I have never seen such brightness (or deep blacks for that matter). I may just need to pick one of the settings to make my &ldquo;night mode&rdquo; as the light sensor mode seems a little over dramatic. I do see a bit of back light &ldquo;bloom when the tv is on but dark, but only while loading content or during some scenes on a blu-ray. It&rsquo;s there, but it&rsquo;s not a problem for me. The tv came in great, protective packaging and took about 2 hours to get out of the box but there were no bends or dead pixels. Most of the complaints I read were about things that seem like damage in transit or improper un-boxing. Fingers crossed that the two reviews on here about &ldquo;dead in 6 months&rdquo; are not a trend.The design of the tv is a thing of beauty. The triangle stand with the brushed steel plate and the tiny LED in the front bottom of the frame are very elegant looking.One final thing I want to stress. I constantly hear people saying they like HD and 4k but that &ldquo;everything looks like a Soap Opera&rdquo; or &ldquo;everything moves too fast&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m amazed people don&rsquo;t research it and find out it&rsquo;s the MotionFlow and Cinemotion (for Sony, and other &ldquo;motion-y&rdquo; terms for the other manufacturers). TURN IT OFF for anything except for LIVE TV and Sports. Turn it off!Great tv, perfectly happy with this for the next 10 years.p.s. If you need Active 3D glasses, I recommend the 3Active Sony-Compatible rechargeable glasses. They are ultra light-weight and block the sides so you literally have no distraction from the screen. They also come with a protective case!</p>

<h5 id="initial-impressions-after-one-month-of-ownership">Initial Impressions - after one month of ownership</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This TV has three issues that, to me, prevent it from getting five stars.1. Every maybe one or two dozen times I try to turn it on (power button on the included Sony remote), it won&rsquo;t turn on, I have to pull the plug and then plug it back in to get it to start. I&rsquo;ve resorted to plugging it into a power supply that kills the power when I turn it off&hellip;at least this way it always turns on, but the trade off is you wait for the TV to boot up.2. The remote stops responding every so often, you have to wait, almost like an old slow computer, give it maybe 15 or 20 seconds and it starts to respond. I&rsquo;ve only noticed this behavior when going thru menus and channel surfing.3. There is a weird refresh thing that happens on faces in movies (OTA TV isn&rsquo;t affected), like the face is being processed differently and the X1 chip has a lag in processing whatever it is doing. There might be a way around this but nothing I&rsquo;ve tried has worked, I&rsquo;ll have to search the AVS forums. Oh, this is only when you have close ups of the actor&rsquo;s face.Outside of these issues, it is a beautiful TV to look at even when off, all HD and 4K content is amazing. The colors are far better than my last Bravia TV. I keep checking for a firmware update hoping that might be the fix but still nothing. Keep in mind, I was looking for perfection.</p>

<p>Update Dec 6, 2016After only 6 months the 55&rdquo; X930D died. It is unfortunate that the TV died so soon, especially since we did not operate the TV for that many total hours. Contacted Sony and they believe the issue is with the motherboard so they are issuing a repair. Not too excited about having to repair (not replace) this unit after only 6 months so I am lowering my review to 3 stars. I will update as I know more.Original ReviewThe wife and the kids absolutely love this TV and the improved picture quality relative to our previous Samsung 65&rdquo;. We had 2 different Samsung 65&rdquo; TVs, both of which failed and we will never buy another Samsung TV again. We are running the infamous &ldquo;10k&rdquo; settings from AVSForums instead of the factory default and have not noticed any clouding or other reported issues. Perhaps it is a settings issue or luck of the draw for the panel from the factory, I don&rsquo;t know.The other reported issues are that sometimes it arrives bent. The seller we purchased from here at Amazon is shipping the unit upright on a pallet, which is quite unusual so perhaps this is the way it is being handled now? We didn&rsquo;t have this issue either. I did notice that it would be easy to bend the screen when putting it on the stand or the wall due to the overall weight of the TV and the how thin the frame is if 2 people were pushing against it which holding it up. If it was lying flat on a palette and bouncing around in a truck I could also see it bending.The other report issue of 3D not working correctly due to cross talk could be true, although we could care less about 3D around our home and never used the feature on any TV we had.All in all we are very pleased so far. The 4K and HDR content is amazing on this box from both the Roku4 and the Ultra HD Blu-ray player. I have it hooked up wiht a 4K computer for the HTC Vive VR and that works well too. I paired it with a Yamaha RX-A3050 because we wanted to switch HDCP sources and 4K at 60 frames, which a lot of receivers can&rsquo;t handle.I will update this review from time to time as I learn more about the TV.Update May 8th, 2016Absolutely hate the remote that comes with this TV and whoever at Sony designed this remote should be shot. The arrow buttons, which you use to navigate are so close to the Home, TV and other related buttons that you constantly accidentally hit them and navigate away. Who thought this was a good idea? Fortunately I am not using the Android apps for the TV, instead I prefer a Roku4 and an Nvidia Shield instead. However Sony has a promotion that gives you 4 free HDR movies when you buy this TV through this June and I had to use the integrated 4K Sony app to acquire and stream the titles you select. By the way, they look sooo amazing in HDR over the Internet, we were really impressed. I am not going to take away any stars because of the bad remote design since we prefer Logitech Smart remotes anyway.Update May 16th, 20164K content on this TV is absolutely amazing and we are absolutely amazed at the color clarity and image quality of this TV. I am seeing colors that I never saw before in my content with this Sony TV. The wife says it is almost indescribable the picture quality of this TV in 4K and how vibrant the color is.Update May 29th, 2016The wife told me that we need this TV in the master bedroom too, so I just purchased another one to replace an older LG Plasma. The picture quality is so stunning she demanded we do it, that&rsquo;s a first! It&rsquo;s funny that we are watching content we have seen numerous times and didn&rsquo;t realize the details we were missing. For example, we watch Wreck it Ralph and never realized it was raining in a scene before because you couldn&rsquo;t see it on other TVs. We own about 6 smaller Samsungs as well and various other TVs and monitors and nothing has ever come close to the picture quality of this TV. Now we can watch Game of Thrones in detail in the bedroom too!</p>
