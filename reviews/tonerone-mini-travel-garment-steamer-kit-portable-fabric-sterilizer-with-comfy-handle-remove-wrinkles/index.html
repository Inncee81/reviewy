<h5 id="an-absolute-must-have-for-any-home">An absolute must have for any home!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mini steamer has been a huge time saver in my household. I have a few dresses and shirts that no matter how careful I am they wrinkle to no end. After the very first use with my new mini steamer I was digging through my clothes pulling out every item with even a small wrinkle just to be able to use it, it really works that well! Its very easy to use just open the top, pour in the water and fill to the max line, put top back on and plug into your power outlet. The directions say 2 minutes is needed for water to boil but honestly 20 seconds is all I needed. After steaming one piece of clothing the water will most likely be about empty so you just refill the tank and you&rsquo;re ready to continue steaming! For anyone looking for a way to get your clothes wrinkle free in under 5 minutes (including setting up your steamer) then this item is definitely for you! I have attached pictures of two of my shirts that wrinkle like crazy and this steamer brought them back to life.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-travel-and-has-a-carry-case">Great for travel and has a carry case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little steamer for traveling. I found It fits in my carry on quite nicely and comes with a carting case. It heats up very quickly and you get a good amount of steam from the nozzle. I found holding the nozzle flat against the clothing to work best. Do not over fill. I can see myself using this on trips as I am tired of wrinkled clothing.The steamer has two parts. The top twists off and once apart you can see the two notches to match it back up to. There are also two arrows to let you know you have it back on correctly (very important.)Per FTC Guidelines-I have received this item either at discounted rate or for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion. Amazon and the seller or manufacturer do not have any influence over my review.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-steamer">Excellent Steamer!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little steamer packs a BIG punch! I hate ironing. I have three kids and life is too crazy to have to waste time at an ironing board. I&rsquo;ve always wanted a steamer and finally got one - this guy - and it&rsquo;s perfect! It&rsquo;s small, light-weight, easy to use, easy to clean, and works perfectly. Once you fill it with water to the fill line, you turn it on and wait about 2 mins for it to be ready. The instructions that are included are incredibly easy to follow, too. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a steamer or even if you&rsquo;re just an anti-ironing person such as myself, this is for you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p> I received my Tonerone Minnie Travel Garment it was pack real good I didn&rsquo;t get it damage. It&rsquo;s an awesome steamer it&rsquo;s little but it does the job of a big one. I like to use it on delicate clothes it&rsquo;s easy to steam it. Once you turn it on in seconds it starts to boil the water and you can start to iron your clothes. It&rsquo;s great to pack and travel with it or use it at home and it&rsquo;s also easy to use. I highly recommend this item and the seller was very friendly and helpful.</p>

<h5 id="to-be-honest-i-don-t-like-to-use-traditional-iron-because-it-takes-too-much">To be honest I don&rsquo;t like to use traditional iron because it takes too much &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for this mini garment steamer which make my life much easier! To be honest I don&rsquo;t like to use traditional iron because it takes too much time to set up. With this garment steamer, I could finish my job in a short time without set up anything at all. All you have to do is open and fill water, then plug into outlet. Your wrinkle shirt will become perfect one in just a couple minutes. Due to its potability and functionality, I would highly recommend this steamer to all my friends and family!</p>

<h5 id="wrinkle-free">Wrinkle free!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such a life saver device. For someone like me who travels a lot, is so practical to carry with you if you are not staying in a hotel where they have an iron, then this will help you look presentable.It&rsquo;s small and portable and very easy to use. Just fill water to the max line and turn it on to let it heat for 2 min and that&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s ready to use.Make sure to follow the intrusction to clean it si that you maintain it working well. I suggest using bottle water to avoid any plaque in it.Even If you don&rsquo;t travel a lot, but hate ironing like me than this is also for you. Is not gonna be picture perfect but it will reduce wrinkles significantly enough to look presentable.If this review helped you please click yes and if you have any questions comment down below.Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="very-good-steamer-for-the-money">Very good steamer for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only used the steamer once, but here is what I&rsquo;ve noticed so far:- it heats up extremely rapidly, far less the the two minutes it says in the instructions (although in another place it says 40 seconds, and it was definitely closer to 40 seconds than 2 minutes)- steamed out wrinkles that the professional steamer at the store did not- lightweight, easy to handle- easy to follow instructions- comes with a handy storage bagIt&rsquo;s helpful to tug on the fabric to get the wrinkle out, which would be easier with 3 hands (two to tug the fabric, one to hold the steamer) but that&rsquo;s the case with any steamer. I am very pleased with the product!</p>

<h5 id="it-was-real-quick-and-easy-to-use">it was real quick and easy to use</h5>
