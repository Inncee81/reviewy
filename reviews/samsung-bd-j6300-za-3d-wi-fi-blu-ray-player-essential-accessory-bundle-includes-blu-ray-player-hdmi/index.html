<h5 id="happy-mad-love">Happy-Mad-Love</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After receiving this item, I was stoked to finally be able to retire my first generation LG Blu-ray player. I connected every thing just fine and this unit detected my WiFi signal without a problem. I updated the software easily in about 5mins. Then I decided to see how it would look visually with my recently purchased 4K 55inch Vizio TV. I inserted my Man of Steel Blu-ray disc, and holy cow, the picture quality was amazing playing the previews and the Man of Steel title screen. Then in came the the problem. It wouldn&rsquo;t let me play the actual movie, saying &ldquo;This can not be done because of disc restriction&rdquo;. I was puzzled, so I tried a few other of my favorite movies like Dark Knight Rises and Terminator Salvation and the same thing occurred. At this point I am pissed and thinking that Samsung had beat me out of $150. I tried everything I could think of. I went online and found many complaints with people having this same issue. Turns out the movie industry has started applying region codes to their DVD and Blu-ray released to curtail piracy. From the unit&rsquo;s interface, I registered an account with Samsung and was getting ready to scream on them&hellip;Then I thought, how would Samsung know what region I&rsquo;m in? I went to the time setting and saw that it was set on a European time zone. I changed to my USA time zone and wah lah it did the trick&hellip;It played all three just fine. Happy now I tell ya!</p>

<h5 id="samsung-finally-comes-out-with-a-great-3d-br-player">Samsung finally comes out with a great 3D BR Player!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This might be the first review on the new Samsung BD-H6500. I gave it 5 stars despite an incorrect photo of the back of the product. I previously have an older Samsung BR 3D player which went south after the FW update as it wouldn&rsquo;t play a movie all the way through, and some movies would&rsquo;t play at all. With this one, the player was very simple to install and setup. FIRST THING is, the back requires a Digital Audio Cable and NOT a Digital COAX Cable as the photo shows. So, I wasted $6.99 on getting the Coax Cable and not needing it. In any case, the picture quality is awesome with the up-scaling capabilities. My first movie I tested was a 3D BR movie and although I do not have a 3D TV, it was like if I had had the glasses it would have been popping I think as it was popping for what it could do w/o a 3D TV. The color upscale was fantastic. Loading the movie was quite quick and the play was very smooth. I just got this yesterday so I still need to give it time to see if there are any tweaks or unforeseen issues. Another great thing is it does have a screen display on the unit itself which is hard to find these days w/o going to a Yamaha or high end expensive player. Lately, for the price, this is an awesome player with all the extra features one could really ask for and sturdy. Not like other BR or even DVD players that are just simply plastic light and feeling. I hope this helps&hellip; I am very pleased with it so far. I used it for,as I mentioned a 3D BR movie, checked out a movie on Netflix stream, which was great, and also regular TV HD. All played great, color awesome, and my sound system even sounded better than ever!!!!</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it">I like it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this Blu-Ray player even though I had to return this particular one. This was my first blu-ray so I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect. The first 2-3 DVD&rsquo;s (blu-ray) played ok even though one of them took some work to get it to play. Then by the 4th DVD it was all downhill. Kept freezing and would jump ahead a couple of minutes into the movie or would play with no sound. At first I thought I had a bad disc so returned it for another one only to have the same outcome. Got another movie a week later with the same results. Needless to say I returned it to the seller. I did like the player enough that I ordered another one from somewhere else and it works like a charm. I think I got a lemon based on the new one and how it works. Great picture with the upscaling feature.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-bluray-player">Excellent BluRay Player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After just a week of use, I am very pleased with this DVD player. It loads even Blu-Ray&rsquo;s quickly and plays all DVD&rsquo;s perfectly. My only criticism is the virtually invisible controls on top of the case. Using the remote is fine, but don&rsquo;t even try to use the on-case controls..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good, does what&rsquo;s it supposed to do. Loads quickly and the remote is a Samsung standard which is pretty good. Much better than the less expensive Samsung models which don&rsquo;t even have a power on light and freeze frequently.</p>
