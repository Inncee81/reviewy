<p>IMPROVE POWER
Practice baseball or softball while getting a strength workout at the same time. The training ball engages essential muscles for pitching and batting, including forearms, shoulders, and wrists.</p>

<p>IMPROVE VELOCITY
The heavy nature of the 1-pound training ball will condition your muscles to adapt to its increased weight while practicing with it. Watch your throwing and hitting velocity skyrocket when you revert back to the standard ball. Strike out the batter or slam the ball home with ease!</p>

<p>IMPROVE TECHNIQUE
Repeated use of training ball during practice will stimulate muscle memory on form, allowing you to master your pitching, throwing, and batting technique more quickly than when using a standard ball. Due to the weighted nature of the ball, erroneous swings will be instantly identified, making the training ball a perfect tool for form correction.</p>

<p>DURABLE AND COMFORTABLE
The robust 1-pound, 3-inch diameter weighted ball is made to endure many hits, swings, and landings.</p>

<p>CONVENIENT AND SAFE TO PRACTICE ANYWHERE

<h5 id="they-are-easy-to-find-in-the-grass-because-of-being-red">They are easy to find in the grass because of being red</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are very durable weighted balls. They are a little softer than the tcb balls which stopped a lot of jarring of the girls hands when hitting them. We used them before each game and practice and the girls hitting improved every game. They are easy to find in the grass because of being red. I would recommend them to anyone looking for weighted balls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-coaches-and-players-loved-them-i-just-purchased-this-15-pack-for">The coaches and players loved them. I just purchased this 15 pack for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two nine packs for our spring baseball season and we used them before every game with our 10U baseball team. They held up extremely well. The coaches and players loved them. I just purchased this 15 pack for our fall league and next season.</p>

<h5 id="hands-down-best-weighted-ball-on-the-market">Hands down best weighted ball on the market!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are some of the almost durable weighted balls I have ever used! As a coach for a youth baseball team I have had the 3 pack and they have survived the abuse and damage of the boys! I was so excited when I seen the release of a 15 pack!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-training-tool">Great training tool</h5>
