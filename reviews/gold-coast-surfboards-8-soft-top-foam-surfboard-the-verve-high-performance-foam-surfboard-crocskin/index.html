<blockquote>
<p>This board rocks! This board seems to float and run SO much better than my 9&rsquo; that I wish I had started on a Gold Coast board. The board seems to catch waves without too much paddle effort. Seems to fall into the right place on the wave which makes it that much more fun for me (not an incredibly experienced surfer). It&rsquo;s perfect for me! The board is better than any other soft boards I&rsquo;ve tried and I swear I&rsquo;m catching more waves on it. Great price, great quality!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ton-of-fun-and-great-experience">Ton of Fun and Great Experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bit of background - I&rsquo;ve been surfing for a little over 3 years. Typically in Rockaway NY on a performance longboard but wanted something I could be a little rough on in the summer mush/ party waves and not have to worry about fixing dings every other weekend. Enter Goldcoast&rsquo;s 8&rsquo; Verve. Board is a ton of fun. Lots of float but I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was on a SUP like some other foamies I&rsquo;ve been on. I wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan of the thruster setup so I opted for the single fin which I&rsquo;ve enjoyed a ton (mostly just my preference &amp; background). Also, and this goes a long a way with me, they&rsquo;re just a great company to deal with. Clearly very excited about the product and super helpful. I ordered through Amazon with zero issues and they&rsquo;ve been super responsive and cool throughout. All to say, really love the product, really love the experience. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a starter board or something they can love roughly. That&rsquo;s it! Have fun!</p>

<h5 id="i-used-to-have-a-6-10-gun-board-that-was-way-beyond-my-skill-level-that-was-fun-and-good-in-my-teens">&rdquo; I used to have a 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; gun board that was way beyond my skill level that was fun and good in my teens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a very long hiatus, a move brought me closer to the beach so I thought, &ldquo;why not revisit my youth??&ldquo;I used to have a 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; gun board that was way beyond my skill level that was fun and good in my teens, but this time I wanted something more appropriate to both my skill level, the surf near me (FL/east coast smaller sets) and my size (5&rsquo;10&rdquo; - 170).After looking at numerous reviews and other research, I couldn&rsquo;t beat $330 for a board, leash and case!I&rsquo;ve only had the chance to take it out a couple of times, but here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got:- Very stable board. I have done my due diligence as far as dry land drills (thank you YouTube) and putting them into practice was very comfortable on this board. I was up on my 4th or 5th wave and once I got a feel for it had a great time. Nothing fancy on the water, but just a lot of fun. Coming from a smaller board required a little more effort as far as manuevering, but that is definitely on me. Once I get better, I can really see making the most out of the Atlantic mush on this thing. When I was pointed the right way, paddling in was smooth and made the 1-3&rsquo; surf completely enjoyable.- Very solid feeling. I was a little worried about a soft top and the flexing, but this was very firm and we&rsquo;ll built while remaining buoyant and surprisingly light. One note, it said somewhere that the skin on the deck didn&rsquo;t need wax (which sounded absurd) and I wasn&rsquo;t about to test that on the water. I did leave a small portion near the nose unwaxed just to see and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend.-Packaging was a little banged up, but the board was in perfect condition. I&rsquo;m putting the blame on UPS for that one, the box was absolutely huge. Putting it all together took less than 30 mins including the fins, leash, pad, etc. Like I said, a real steal, just for including the bag and leash.All in, this is a great deal for anyone new or returning to the water after a while (and real surfers I would imagine). I also got a couple of surf block straps for the roof of the car and would also recommend as they were a breeze. Highly recommended, good luck and happy surfing!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="10-10-highly-recommended"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The board felt great right out of the box and I was up riding waves only a few hours later. It&rsquo;s a great deal fro someone like me who surf for fun and may not be the best in the world. This board is very buoyant, fast, and surprisingly quick rail to rail. I get into the wave very early and I find myself having way more fun on this foamie than my regular shortboard!The bag is great, keeps it clean while and protected while I have it strapped up on my car. I haven&rsquo;t used the pens yet, but from their Instagram they look pretty solid.Overall, I&rsquo;m more than happy with this board package and have been telling all my friends about it. We are all about having fun in the water and this board is perfect for it!&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="this-starter-kit-to-have-everything-and-its-been-awesome-i-ve-gotten-the-opportunity-to-really-get-into">&hellip; this starter kit to have everything and its been awesome! I&rsquo;ve gotten the opportunity to really get into &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m just getting into surfing I didn&rsquo;t want to get anything too expensive but still ride well&ndash;I got this starter kit to have everything and its been awesome! I&rsquo;ve gotten the opportunity to really get into surfing because of it. Funny enough, my buddy (an avid surfer) borrowed it for a day to take out on some choppier NorCal waves and loved it so much he got one too! Great board for beginner or avid surfer&ndash;and the deal you get with the kit can&rsquo;t be beaten. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> if I could!</p>

<h5 id="then-i-got-the-board-as-a-birthday-gift-and-this-is-one-of-the-best-boards-i-ve-seen">Then I got the board as a birthday gift and this is one of the best boards I&rsquo;ve seen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I saw this board online I wasn&rsquo;t too sure about buying it. Then I got the board as a birthday gift and this is one of the best boards I&rsquo;ve seen. I can say I have a lot of fun on it. I am stoked to have this board and am happy that I got this gift. It&rsquo;s definitely worth the money. I highly recommend this board for my beginning friends and even guys who surf love this foam log! It&rsquo;s a rocking board to learn on and it&rsquo;s a bargain. This is a must have board! Have fun and be safe!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-8-board">Excellent 8&rsquo; board!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing board! I have been surfing a little over a year (I am still learning to read the waves and I stand up a couple times a session) and this board was perfect for me. The 8&rsquo; Verve is big enough for me to paddle out and feel really comfortable in the water. I also love the Classic White so I don&rsquo;t stick out like a sore thumb while I am learning. Hopefully by the end of summer I can move to some of their short boards.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-broad-enough">Not broad enough.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not broad enough and I am not able to get up on it as I am on other softboards.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-proceed-with-caution">BUYER BEWARE - PROCEED WITH CAUTION</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT PURCHASE. Not only is the foam top on this board is very cheaply constructed (it came detached from the board base after my second time in the water) but the board also&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="should-give-it-zero-stars">Should give it zero stars&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously buy a cheap styrofoam cooler because it&rsquo;s probably going to last longer than this very cheaply made thing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-board-looks-great-we-ran-into-an-issue-with-the-large">The board looks great! We ran into an issue with the large &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this board for my daughters 8th birthday. The board looks great! We ran into an issue with the large fin fastening to the board, so I contacted Gold Coast via Facebook&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="the-best-love-these-boards">The best. Love these boards</h5>

<p>So much FUNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!! What a feeling when the wave grabs the board and you take off!!!! The best. Love these boards.</p>
