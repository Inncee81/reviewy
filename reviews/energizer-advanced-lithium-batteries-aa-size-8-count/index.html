<h5 id="understand-the-life-issue">Understand the life issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I posted this on another packaging, but there seems to be a lack of understanding on battery life.The shelf life of this battery is rated at 10 years. The shelf life of a standard alkaline is rated at 5 years. So it&rsquo;s twice a long lived if you don&rsquo;t draw any current.The mah capacity of this device (at low current drain) is 750. For the alkaline, 600. So it lasts just a little longer in use.There are 2 types of smoke detectors. One is wired into the house, and only uses the battery for backup when the power is off. For this application, the lithium should last about twice as long. Well worth the trouble of getting out a ladder.The other kind of detector runs off of the battery. This is the detector you added to a room without doing any wiring. For this case, you might as well use a alkaline. It&rsquo;s going to last about the same.This is a great battery for backup applications. Especially where hard to get to. Don&rsquo;t confuse loaded and unloaded life.</p>

<h5 id="great-batteries-but-don-t-waste-them">GREAT BATTERIES BUT DON&rsquo;T WASTE THEM!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I have a drawer full of brand new standard batteries, so why do I need these lithium batteries?First off, you are wasting your money if you put these in flashlights, games or remote controls. Standard batteries are fine and work well. When I say standard batteries I mean good old alkaline batteries.So why you may ask did I purchase lithium batteries if they are wasted being used in those devices? Well, standard alkaline batteries are temperature sensitive. You see, I purchased a clock that has an outside temperature sensor that requires 2 AA batteries. If I place alkaline batteries in the sensor, the alkaline a don&rsquo;t last. When it is very hot, or especially very cold out, the batteries fail. Ah, but enter the lithium battery. These batteries are not as sensitive to temperature changes and work perfectly for my outdoor use.Yes lithium batteries are more expensive, but they will work when they have to in very demanding circumstances like camera drives, motors and things like my little outdoor temperature sensor.</p>

<h5 id="avoid-the-leak-excellent-battery-s-for-devices-that-aren-t-used-that-often">Avoid the Leak! Excellent battery&rsquo;s for Devices that aren&rsquo;t used that often&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hate it when you go to use that device that doesn&rsquo;t get used much and when you try to use it, it just doesn&rsquo;t work? You open the battery compartment and see that white powdery caked on mess of a leaked battery and corroded contacts. Your heat sinks a little bit and you try and clean it up and put some fresh Alkaline, but it&rsquo;s too late&hellip; it&rsquo;s toast and you need to buy another device. Well, that is exactly what happened to me multiple times. In my case a Label printer, AC thermostat, and a Biometric safe etc. So I did a little research on leak resistant battery&rsquo;s and it seems Lithiums based batteries is your main option. So if your anything like me and tired of spending hundreds of dollars replacing your devices that aren&rsquo;t used enuff to drain the batteries before replacement. Do yourself Huge favor and spend the little extra on these Lithium based batteries. You&rsquo;ll save yourself a lot of frustration down the road and as a side bonus, they have a greater self-life than their alkaline cousins&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="lithium-is-the-way-to-go-peace-of-mind">Lithium is the way to go: peace of mind.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not much discussion here. These batteries are way better than alkaline and rechargeable; less weight, better performance, and better energy conservation and much practical in handling. I use them mainly in a Canon camera and in my weather station, and you really can notice de difference between these (lithium) and the others (also from Duracell). Additionally, in the camera, in the past, I usually used rechargeable batteries, but the camera seemed to detect less voltage than expected and keeps sending the message “low battery”, even thought they were brand new and fully charged. So, I had to do the trick of switch position between batteries often to continue using the camera. Once I started using lithium AA, that problem disappeared, these batteries seems to be endless. I highly recommend, these batteries let you live without energy problems, peace of mind. Lithium is the way to go, no alkalines anymore. I highly recommend these batteries, help reducing energy problems, bringing peace of mind.</p>

<h5 id="good-price-long-life">Good Price, Long Life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am stuck on lithium batteries. In devices I use a lot they last a long, long time. In devices I seldom use they hold up even longer and don&rsquo;t die and leak all over, destroying the device. Just wish they were available in &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo; cells, so my flashlights didn&rsquo;t have to have exchanges so often to keep them healthy. One thing to be aware of: These last a long time, but when they die they go quickly. No long warning of weakness, such as dimming bulbs or slower running. These came at the best price I could find.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bait-switch-on-the-batteries">Bait &amp; switch on the batteries.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This should not be permitted. I ordered a blister pack of 8 AAA Energizer batteries with a date on the package. I got 8 AAA in a small plastic box. They may be new Energizers. But then again they may not be. Are they counterfeit, used, defective? There are a lot of complaints on the web about the quality of these generic offers. I purchased these for the long shelf life. The Amazon return window does not last the 12 years that the batteries are supposed to last. The &ldquo;disclaimer&rdquo; is the proverbial &ldquo;fine print&rdquo; that we are supposed to read. It is hidden in a mass of pictures and technical descriptions. Energizer Advanced Lithium Batteries, AAA-8pk.Amazon, wake up! I expect truth in the ads. The amazon batteries show what will be shipped Hold others to your same standard.</p>

<h5 id="longer-than-regular-batteries">Longer than regular batteries</h5>

<p>In my insulin pump, these last about 2 weeks. I will be buying more and more since I go through them so quickly.</p>

<p>Used these to power some super bright Led strips. Worked better and longer than other similar battery. Hope the price will come down more.</p>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good Buy</h5>

<p>Fully charged. I ordered these online as I could not buy them locally. Received theme right away and glad I bought them.</p>

<p>Only lasted 2 years and 7 months in our fire alarm. Bought these because they were supposed to last up to 10 years. Very disappointed. Low battery warning chirping at 4:15 am.</p>
