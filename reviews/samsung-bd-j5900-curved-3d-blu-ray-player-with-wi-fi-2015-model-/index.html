<h5 id="solid-blu-ray-good-user-experience-easy-setup-dvd-up-scaling-could-be-better-3d-support">Solid Blu-Ray, Good User Experience, Easy Setup, DVD Up-Scaling Could Be Better, 3D Support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the Samsung BD-J5900 at a local box store as a gift. I set it up for my friend and evaluated it on their Samsung smart TV. The BD-J5900 has 3D support. In all other features it is identical to the BD-J5700 which I own for my own use.The BD-J5900 is a fine Blu-ray disk player with smart features and a good user interface and it integrates well with Samsung smart TV&rsquo;s. But it has some pitfalls too. I like it with reservations. In this review I&rsquo;ll set my environment so my results can be seen in contextI got the Samsung BD-J5900 because I have a Samsung smart TV and was hoping it would integrate even better than my Panasonic DMP-BDT270 Blu-Ray which I already liked a lot. Unlike the 4K up-scaling Panasonic this Samsung is a 1080P player and does not play 4K content. It is also less expensive&hellip;SHORT VERSIONPro&rsquo;s:+ Integrates well with Samsung Smart TV&rsquo;s+ Supports 3D+ Easy Setup (wired or wireless)+ Fast Startup+ Logical and responsive user interface+ Well designed remote+ Good App Selection and Home Networking+ Compact SizeCon&rsquo;s:- Upscaling of DVD media could be better- Amazon app appears to be SD onlyBottom line for me is if DVD up-scaling or Amazon app HD are not really important this is a 5 star value. If they are, then 4 stars.For more details, read on&hellip;SETUP:I set the BD-J5900 up with a physical LAN connection. I had one available and I think it&rsquo;s more reliable than WiFi. I did configure my WiFi settings manually and it connected right away and was able to access YouTube with good quality. I then reverted to a wired LAN.NOTE: Once the player is running I strongly recommend upgrading the firmware in the settings under the support menu item. New firmware brings bug/performance fixes, feature improvements and sometimes new apps.IN USE:When turning on the Samsung player the time to home screen is about the same as the Panasonic which I feel is very fast. From turn-on to home screen with a Blu-Ray in the tray is about 8 seconds! To display the image of the Blu-ray in the play-disc box is another 3 seconds. Yup. I think that&rsquo;s pretty quick and includes the player using CEC protocol to tell my Samsung TV to switch the active input to the player.The home screen is logically laid out (see picture) with boxes for media (disc plus home networked or USB based photos, videos, music) on the top. Below that are 4 app favorites. Mine default to Hulu Plus, Amazon, You Tube and Netflix. There is the Opera TV store with more web content and a plus with the label more which brings you to the full list of apps. Next there is change device to select the source on your network and access to player settings.The full list of built-in Apps on mine include Amazon, Hulu Plus, You Tube, VUDU, CinemaNow, InternetTV, Yupp TV, Netflix, Pandora, Rhapsody, AccuWeather. I&rsquo;ve only used Amazon, You Tube, Netflix and Pandora. All were fine for me except Amazon. The Amazon app seems unable to stream HD content - all that was available to me was SD. If you are getting in part for the Amazon app, you might want to consider other options like the Fire TV.MEDIA CONSIDERATIONS:In my video library is a lot of DVD content and how they play is important to me. In particular how well a Blu-ray player can up-scale the DVD video for display on HD players. Up-scaling is very difficult to do well and the BD-J5900 does a credible job, but not as well as the more expensive Panasonic player and it&rsquo;s 4K up-scaling hardware. If you have a large DVD library and up-scaling matters to you consider spending a little more money for the Panasonic.As I add new content on physical media I&rsquo;m choosing Blu-ray where possible. Blu-Ray plays fine and has a startup as quick as the Panasonic. On my HD TV there is no visible quality difference. Excellent.REMOTE:The Samsung BD-J5900 remote is needed to do pretty much anything except turn on the power or open the tray. Happily it is well laid with nicely sized buttons for my hands. It can also turn my Samsung TV on/off and change the volume and input. The batteries were included for the remote. The IR LED is bright enough to work pointed almost anywhere in my living room. This remote is better in just about every way than the already good remote that came with the Panasonic.CONCLUSIONS:I like the Samsung BD-J5900 Blu-ray player. Most things are very good and it has a speedy and logically laid out interface and very good remote with a good user experience. But for me there are a couple of shortcomings too. First the Amazon app seems to be SD only (maybe a future firmware update will fix this?), and second dvds do not upscale as well as the Panasonic player (as of this review). Not bad, but noticeably worse.If you have a lot of DVD content or Amazon video in HD matters consider the Panasonic. If not this is a good value and has a better user interface. For me this is 4 stars, but if you don&rsquo;t care about the up-scaling it may be 5 stars for you.Hope this helps someone!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>received the BluRay player yesterday. Plays all my dvd&rsquo;s and Bluray discs w/o any difficulties. Set up was a breeze. As soon as it connected to my wireless internet router, it asked to update the firmware. which i did. I have a Samsung Smart TV and the TV remote controls both the Bluray player and the television. Granted the Bluray controls are basic but still useful. The Blu-ray remote has more functionality but really not needed. Connected the Blu-ray player to Samsung TV via HDMI cable. works like a charm. I can even connect to various internet media just like the smart television. FYI: I burnt a Blu-ray disc with multiple .AVI files and this player recognized and played the &ldquo;.avi&rdquo; files without any problems.Will update if I find any negative aspect of this purchase. So far it has been a very good purchase for the price.</p>

<h5 id="tip-for-eliminating-wireless-connection-problem">Tip for Eliminating Wireless Connection Problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided to write a review because it seemed like there are a few of you that have problem with its Wireless Connection.It took me awhile to figured out why I too was having so much problem with its wireless connection. At times it saw my wireless network but wouldn&rsquo;t connect to it. At other times, it didn&rsquo;t see any network at all. I tried to input information manually, that failed too. It turned out that if I put any object on top of the player, even if it&rsquo;s a small note pad, it interfered with its wireless connection. Once I removed all objects on top of the player, the wireless connection worked fine. Haven&rsquo;t had anymore problem ever since with any of the 3 players (same brand &amp; model) that I own.I like it and it&rsquo;s been working fine so far. The reason I gave it a 4 star only is for the same complaint that many have listed. It has no on/off indication for us to know.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-watching-3d-movies">Great for watching 3D movies</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this 3D Blu-ray player specifically so I could watch 3D Blu-ray movies. I was surprised by how small this unit is compared to my old Blu-ray player. It&rsquo;s very light and very thin and meant to be stacked on top of other components. Stacking things on top of this player won&rsquo;t really work well. There is no display on the unit itself. I imagine the size and lack of display are the main reasons this item is relatively inexpensive. To me, 3D is more of a novelty than anything, so I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot on a player.Setting up the player was simple. Make sure to note that it doesn&rsquo;t come with an HDMI cable. If you&rsquo;re in need of an HDMI cable, I recommend one of the Amazon Basics cables since they seem to work and can be purchased for less than seven dollars. Set up basically amounts to plugging in the HDMI cable and the electrical cord. I plugged the HDMI cable into my receiver and I was able to play Blu-ray movies immediately. Since I have a Samsung Smart TV, I haven&rsquo;t made use of the Apps.The picture quality of this player is great. I watched Life of Pi in 3D and the picture was fantastic. It was fun to watch a 3D movie at home. I am very happy with this purchase. If you&rsquo;re just looking for a 3D Blu-ray player with great picture quality, I highly recommend this product.</p>
