<h5 id="works-fine-good-quality-nice-tough-durable-protective-braid-no-issues-using-to-relocate-a-nintendo-switch-docking-station">Works fine. Good quality, nice tough durable protective braid. No issues. Using to relocate a Nintendo Switch docking station</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>HDMI is a digital signal. It either works, or it doesn&rsquo;t. There is no &ldquo;this cable looks better than that cable&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not possible in the digital world. It&rsquo;s more about does it work yes/no, is the quality sturdy and good? yes/no. This one is yes and yes for both.I purchased this so I could located my Nintendo Switch dock to the front of my entertainment center. It works perfectly, and allows me to pipe the audio and video from the Switch into my receiver located 10&rsquo; away (and through a wall) on a shelf, without issue. High quality cable, with a nice thick protective braid. I needed to thread it through a small tight fitting opening to get to where my media equipment resides, and it took the stress of being run through that wall just fine.Good quality, and it works fine.</p>

<h5 id="worked-flawlessly-in-all-modes-with-macbook-pro-el-capitan-10-11-6-great-price-well-made-packaged">Worked Flawlessly in All Modes with MacBook Pro (El Capitan 10.11.6); Great Price; Well Made &amp; Packaged</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great right out of the box on my 17&rdquo; MacBook Pro (mid-2010) running El Capitan (Mac OS X 10.11.6) driving a ViewSonic video projector through a 25&rsquo; BlueRigger Rugged High Speed HDMI Cable from an Ivanky HDMI adapter. I had no need to restart, nor access any system preferences whatsoever. I just hot-plugged the Ivanky adapter into my MBP and hot-connected the BlueRigger HDMI cable. (Mirror was already the default Mac display setting.) A flawless image of my Mac desktop immediately appeared on the screen to which the projector pointed. A few seconds later, I opened the Display System Preference. My Mac knew the ViewSonic video projector&rsquo;s model number and characteristics.My goal was to use Keynote with this cable, et al, configuration. Every aspect of Keynote worked flawlessly using the Ivanky adapter and BlueRigger HDMI cable.The product appears to be very well made, came with protective end-caps for both HDMI cable end, and was package professionally and cleanly.The BlueRigger price was very competitive.The purchase and experience were perfect in my judgement.I would definitely purchase both this same or a different BlueRigger cable and/or Ivanky adapter in the future. I recommend both companies highly.Worked Flawlessly in All Modes with MacBook Pro (El Capitan 10.11.6); Great Price; Well Made &amp; Packaged</p>

<h5 id="great-cable-great-connection-but-i-got-shorted-the-nylon-braiding">Great cable, great connection, but I got shorted the nylon braiding :(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Functionally, this isn&rsquo;t a bad cable at all. It does exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to, is a great length, and is a great price. I ordered this one after I ordered the shorter version the I enjoyed so much. There&rsquo;s a hitch with this cable, but I&rsquo;ll explain that later.The cable is made of extremely durable material and the connections fit extremely well with my devices. The ends are extremely well made, and you can tell that the part that connects the cable to the end is as durable as it gets. A long cable is such an advantage when you have an entertainment center with things spaced far apart. The image quality is superb, and I haven&rsquo;t experienced any flickering or broken connections. The cable is a little stiff so it&rsquo;s hard to turn it the right way to plug into the TV sometimes, but I feel better knowing the wire isn&rsquo;t going to crimp or bend which could lead to a short.Now for the hitch.The thing I really enjoyed more than anything about the smaller cable was that it was nylon braided. That truly gave me a sense of quality and durability. However, for some reason this one came without the nylon braiding! I had to travel to another country for an extensive time, so there was no way I could have returned it at the time. Functionally, it did the job. However, I was really disappointed that it wasn&rsquo;t the cool nylon braided cable that I got the first time.Great cable! Just check to make sure they don&rsquo;t forget the nylon braiding!</p>

<h5 id="no-dropped-signals-not-with-these-cables-any-length">No DROPPED SIGNALS&hellip;not with these cables(any length)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If for whatever the reason you experience dropped signals use these cable and experience smoorh uninterrupted video and audio. I have my cable box connected to a projector. Lately the video and audio signals would drop and search from 480 to 768 to 1080. I was using other HDMI cables. (Including Amazon basics). I figured I needed new cables. I researched and read reviews about the BLUE RIGGER CABLES. I tried the 3 ft and 10 ft cables. NO DROPPED SIGNALS. Best cables and reasonably-priced.</p>

<h5 id="good-cable-and-even-better-value-update-04-17">GOOD CABLE and EVEN BETTER VALUE- UPDATE 04/17</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>GOOD CABLE, ORDERED SEVERAL, REVISED THIS REVIEW, UNFAIR TO BLUERIGGER; AS THERE REALLY WAS A BAD EXPERIENCE WHERE WRONG ITEM, RETURNED AND NOT CREDITED,, ENTIRE ORDER WAS RETURNED (except for one hose where adapters were purchased during 80 mile round trip, the other no credit; overall not good). WAS WRONG, THIS CABLE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED.. FOURTH OR FIFTH ONE,, CURRENT ORDER IS TO HAVE EXTRA ON HAND, KEPT IN LAPTOP CASE FOR TRAVELS. NO POINT IN BUYING A MORE EXPENSIVE HDMI CABLE. THIS IS LATEST SPEC INCLUDING ARC (AUDIO RETURN CHANNEL). APOLOGIES FOR ANY CONFUSION. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE NEEDING EITHER HDMI OR Cat 5 CABLE SHOULD NOT HESITATE TO PURCHASE,, davzway</p>

<h5 id="must-buy-for-4k">Must buy for 4K</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product for the new 65&rdquo; 4K UHD HDR LG OLED tv. Of the two cables that I had purchased, both are going through my wall cavity and plugged into my Xfinity X1 cable box and my Xbox One S. The quality is top notch as they have no trouble with the latest standards for new flat screen tvs.</p>
