<h5 id="back-from-a-pretty-grueling-trip">Back from a pretty grueling trip</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this from Amazon just before a two week trip first to the Barcelona area then a cruise that took us to Mount Vesuvius/Pompeii, Downtown Rome via the train, Pisa and a Tuscany vineyard, then walking around Palma on Majorca then back to Barcelona. I experienced no problems with the case at all, Zipping remains smooth, Camera access is good, the strap is comfortable and it holds the gear I use.Here&rsquo;s what I use it for. My camera is a Sony A-37 with a Kit lens and a sigma 28-200. The other lens is kept in the main compartment which I skew to one side using the included Velcro dividers to allow for better fit for the camera. On the other (smaller)side I keep six P series filters for easy access. With either lens attached to the A-37 I can leave the Cokin filter holder on. With the 18-55 lens on I can leave the Cokin hood on in either the inner or outer position. I put it above the filters in the main compartment when the longer lens is attached. For those familiar with this hood you know its not that deep. The main compartment flap has a zippered compartment for small flat stuff like a lens wipe and screen covers. Sewn into the flap there are two SD card holders with Velcro and each holds two of the new BASIC packaging. It also holds a samsung tab 3 7.0 which I eye-fi my pics to but only with a folio cover if I remove the filters.The Upper compartment I keep several more filters about another 6, two chargers and four batteries in the mesh pocket on the flap. The mesh is perfect for the batteries because they are easy to find. There&rsquo;s a little room left over but not enough for a flash or another lens. Absent the filters and chargers there would be enough room for any of the Sony flashes and a small primary lens.The front of the case has a gusseted zippered pocket which I kept a spare filter holder (I thought perhaps I might break one because it goes face down in the case but this was unfounded.), dead batteries and yes, a few more filters. I also kept a dust blaster.The side of the pack opposite the access flap has a hard strap and an adjustable buckled strap. I used this for the small alum tripod that I use. I would have preferred a pocket at the bottom such as on the lowepro but believe me this is the ONLY thing I would change.We had just about perfect weather during the trip but we did get caught in a thunder storm in Rome on the way back to the train station. It&rsquo;s amazing how fast the street venders change from offering bottled water to umbrellas but we had the pack covered with the built in waterproof cover so no sale for the street vendors. It takes about 15 seconds to deploy and doesn&rsquo;t interfere the pack strap at all. I don&rsquo;t think that it says this anywhere in the literature but this cover is detachable via Velcro inside the slot where it stores. It&rsquo;s not necessary to detach it to use it.This pack carried and protected my gear through some pretty tough conditions. Lot&rsquo;s of crowds, buses and trains during the trip. Was definitely up to the task.One little note. On Carrer Princesa in Barcelona there is a little pastry shop. Let&rsquo;s just say you might want to carry the case in front of you. It&rsquo;s comfortable enough that you forget it&rsquo;s there. So please anyone in Barcelona patronize this shop. It&rsquo;s the one with the plexiglass shelving in the window. No one could have been nicer about the breakage. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed with the pastries either.Update: After several more photo adventures the bag is still going strong.</p>

<h5 id="8-inches-wide-fits-d5500-16-300-super-zoom-lenz-attached-with-the-hood-and-two-prime-lenses-on-each-side">8 inches wide. Fits D5500 + 16-300 super zoom lenz attached (with the hood) and two prime lenses on each side</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like to keep things small and simple. So I was trying to find the smallest camera bag possible that fits the camera and 3 lenses, and still not as big as a regular camera backpack. I got Nikon D5500 and a super zoom lens attached, plus the hood on the lens that adds about an inch and two prime lenses that are relatively small side by side.D5500 + this lens (with the lens hood)Â Tamron AFB016N700 16-300 F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD Macro 16-300mm IS Interchangeable Lens for Nikon CamerasÂ makes it 8 inches long and it all fits in the bag without taking zoom lenz off, which is just what I was looking for! Two prime lenses are sitting side by side and everything is tight and well protected. The front top zipper has plenty of space for charger, batteries, filters, and other stuff.So if you have any of these (D3x00, D5x00, D7x00) with super zoom lens like (16-300, 18-300, 18-200, 18-140) it will fit!</p>

<h5 id="good-design-good-price-but-bad-protection">Good design, good price, but BAD protection.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this bag a year ago, because of good design, the great reviews and good price. It remained as a perfect bag for all my gears in one small and efficient place, until one day, I dropped it from knee height (NOT from 3rd floor) to the floor. It absorbed a part of impact, but still failed to protect my lens inside.Now I take a closer look at it, the walls of the main section are not thick enough. Except that the back plate that directly touches your back is solid and thick (but that&rsquo;s for comfortableness, not really often impact will come from that way), only the lids with multi-layer pouches in every section can absorb slightly more impact. Now I am adding more materials to protect my gears.I ALWAYS handle my gears very carefully. They are still in mint conditions after years of use. But maybe every few years, this accident might hit you once, and that will be enough.If you just need a place to store all your gears, but they are inexpensive to replace, get this bag. But if your gears are more valuable, one small accident can cost you fifty times the price of this bag, either you get a more expensive bag with better protection, or you enhance the bag inside out by yourself.If you don&rsquo;t do that right now, maybe you won&rsquo;t regret for years, but I promise, you will. (Just a piece of advice out of good will.)</p>
