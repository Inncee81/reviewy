<blockquote>
<p>It has performed perfectly so far. Setup on 4 computers, 2 Win7 (64bit), 1 Win 8.1 (64bit) and 1 Win 10 (64bit). One note on the setup. I had gone to HP&rsquo;s website and downloaded their latest version of the full software to install on all of the computers. The printer is directly wired to the router via Ethernet and assigned a static IP address. When trying to install from the downloaded software, on 3 separate computers all hard wired to the same router, the software would not find the printer automatically, specifying the IP address, specifying the Host name or using the hardware (MAC) address. At the same time I tried searching using the exact IP address and it failed I was able to open the printers web page in IE by using the static IP address in the URL. There is a PROBLEM with the downloaded software&rsquo;s discovery routine. And, yes, I had turned off all firewalls in the computers. The software on the shipped CD ROM in every case found the printer without a problem.Another problem I have seen in comments is about lines in the scans when scanning through the ADF. I serviced Xerox machines as a Xerox employee for 35+ years. 99.9% of the time this is caused by a SPOT on the glass. The MFP 426 has 2 separate glasses that it uses when doing ADF scans. It does not use the large glass when scanning from the ADF. The smaller glass to the left of the main glass is one side of a double sided scan and the small glass in the document feeder that you can see when you open the document feeder to see the glasses is the other side of ADF scanning. The easiest way to confirm that it is an ADF glass spot is to scan the same document on the main platen. If it is indeed a dead pixel in the scanner, you will still get a line from the platen glass.Other than those comments the printer seems to perform flawlessly. I use the TWAIN driver and scan into PaperPort. It scans over the network and the TWAIN driver works great.3/3/2017 Update. I like to install both a PCL and Postscript version of each printer because the different RIPs can produce different results. Today I installed the HP Universal Postscript Driver (from their website). It appeared to work fine. Then I started having problems with some things not launching correctly, including Windows Update, Civilization 5 and Samsung Magician (for my Samsung 850EVO SSD). After a couple of hours doing virus scans, running Windows System File checker and removing the Postscript Printer from Devices and Printers, I did a system restore from a restore point yesterday. That fixed my problems. I would highly recommend that anyone considering installing HP&rsquo;s Universal Postscript driver create a restore point BEFORE they install it so you can recover if it causes you a similar problem. My system is an I7-4790, 16gig, Samsung 850EVO 1tb, NVIDIA GTX980. I have been building systems and programming since 1980. This was very disappointing.</p>

<h5 id="nice-family-office-upgrade">Nice Family Office upgrade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I brought this All-in-One Laserjet printer as an upgrade to my HP LaserJet Pro 400 M401dne Monochrome Printer (CF399A) (Discontinued By Manufacturer) which has been and still working like a champ to this day. We needed a scanner &amp; copier for my family&rsquo;s office and school needs which is why I invested in this particular model and so far it has fit that bill perfectly.Pros:- Like the current Enterprise solutions this All-In-One model has it to were you are not bound to the provided software that in the past would have could have been used from your PC and most functions can be done directly from the device itself.- Nice 3 inch color touch pad which you can scan, copy, or print directly from the device itself.- Great built in Website for advance configuration for your All-in-Device (I.E. Scan to Print, Scan to E-mail, Scan to network Share etc&hellip;)- The supplied Software with the Device was easy to install and use on your Computer (Please also see cons), The software was supplied in the box with the device but can also be download from HP Support as well.- Able to setup a network location for scanned documents to be accessed anywhere on your Network and can also be setup to have the scanned items e-mailed to you (Please Also see cons)- Came with a 3100 rated ink cartridge (Please Note since I got this through Amazon Warehouse Deals it was a generic cartridge not a genuine HP cartridge but it does work well).While on a whole it has been a great addition to our family office environment there was 2 small cons worth noting to be on the outlook for&hellip;1.) The Supplied software did not work on one of my Windows 10 PC&rsquo;s and would only print once the software was installed.Even though it said it loaded all included software the Scan Software features would not load. I was able to circumvent this for the one Windows 10 machine by loading it onto a Windows 7 VM (Virtual Machine), however like I said in to pros it can also be done from the device itself but for the advance features you will need the software. Amazingly enough however it did work on my other Windows 10 machine&rsquo;s2) No matter how much I tried to get the correct SMTP setting from MSN to configure the the scan to e-mail feature to work, it would reject it and error out every time which is a little bit of a let down. This is a nice feature that I would like to see working one day. Please note it may still work for other commercial e-mail provided servers.Overall this is a great All-in-one LaserJet for the buck I would highly recommend it.Included with Device:- AC Power Cord- 3100 Rated print job Black Ink cartridge- HP Drivers, Scan Software, and Documentation CDSupported Operating Systems:- Windows XP SP3, Vista, 7, 8 (and 8.1) and 10- Windows Server 2003 SP2, 2008 (and R2), 2012 (and R2), and 2016- Mac Operating Systems (Drivers and Software Must be download from HP)- Linux Operating Systems (Drivers and Software Must be download from HP)- Apple and IOS Devices*** Please NOTE: that this model of HP Laserjet All-In-One Printer DOES not have a built-in WiFi adapter, However it can be connected to a WiFI Router to support this option through its 1GB Ethernet Plug to use the Air Print capabilities.</p>

<h5 id="good-images-my-favorite-thing-is-how-quiet-it">good images. My favorite thing is how quiet it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was replacing an HP4100 with this one and using as a network printer. It prints fast, very little relay. The scan feature works very well, good images. My favorite thing is how quiet it is. I have about 6 people printing on this and haven&rsquo;t had a single paper jam or issue. So far I&rsquo;m loving it!</p>

<h5 id="good-and-bad-features-may-or-may-not-be-right-for-you">Good and bad features, may or may not be right for you</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PROS: Printer is fast and not too loud. Scanner is fast and easy to use. Copier ok. May never use fax. Email printing is cool.CONS: Touch screen (finicky, small, should be illegal). Stinks (worse than other laser printers). No envelope feed. Took 6 hours (hp support forums of no help) to get printer to work (scan and copy worked right away). Accursed IPv6 was the problem - disabled IPv6 on the (ugh) touch screen and printing worked immediately. Pulsating power ELD is extremely bright in a darkened room (black electrical tape cured that).</p>

<p>Very good printer, does the job if several machines in one. Bit big, but good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-a-business-office">Not for a business office</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t last five months before the digital screen went blank. HP&rsquo;s idea of a warranty is to charge me $60 for them to take it back and fix/replace. My idea of a warranty is that you stand behind a product and fix it for free during your warranty period. Says it can be used in a 3-10 user office and up to 3500 pages per month. We are 3 users maybe 1500 per month and it just didn&rsquo;t hold up. We only used it for faxes and copies - not even hooked up to any computers as a printer. I think it might work in a home office for one person. Definitely not a piece of office equipment.</p>
