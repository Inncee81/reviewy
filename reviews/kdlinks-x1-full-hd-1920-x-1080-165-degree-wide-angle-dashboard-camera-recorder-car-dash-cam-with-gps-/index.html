<h5 id="beautiful-quality-videos-and-lots-of-options">Beautiful quality videos and lots of options.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After days or more of research I found this camera to have the highest reviews I have seen. I love it so much I bought a 2nd one for the back window. It truly is awesome. The video quality is incredible even at night like it is during the day. All I did was put some black fabric tape around the chrome piece around the lens. I HIGHLY recommend this product. The picture quality is great also btw. The software has awesome features if you have the GPS and MPH option enabled. I would give this 10 stars if it let me :) Great product!!Over a year later and the cameras are still working perfectly. Zero issues.The images are random screen shots from videos I have taking with the cameras. I love the date, time stamp and speed on the videos. The GPS coordinates are embedded in the video files. That can be pulled up using the software provided with the cameras.</p>

<h5 id="great-all-around-camera">Great all-around camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So this is a pretty impressive camera. It&rsquo;s performing better than my dashcams I&rsquo;ve been running the past few years (to be expected) and, surprisingly, on par with or better than my GoPro Hero3+ Black and GoPro Hero4 Black, the previous gen and current top of the line GoPros (impressive!). You can watch my in depth ~22 min review of the camera here: (&hellip;)In short, it&rsquo;s a pretty great camera. You get full 1080p recording at 30fps which is the sweet spot for high quality and smooth video without using up too much memory card space, it has an LCD to make it easier to frame your camera and change settings, the GPS is helpful to record your speed and where you&rsquo;ve been (it comes with a second mount that&rsquo;s GPS-less if you&rsquo;d prefer to not use it), the camera can spin on its mount to record at different angles or even back towards the passengers, the status LED is good for letting you know what&rsquo;s happening without being too annoying, and the audio quality is great.If you&rsquo;d like to see some sample footage, here&rsquo;s 6 minutes worth during the day and at night, in sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather. That way you can get a good feel for it in a variety of conditions. (&hellip;)You can easily read license plates pretty close up during the day. At night you can do it too. It&rsquo;s tougher at night and in parking decks due to the longer exposures needed in darker areas, so it doesn&rsquo;t do as well grabbing plates on moving cars or if you&rsquo;re driving past, but this is normal.My copy had this high pitched tone during all the audio recording which I found out was abnormal after talking with other owners. I returned it for that issue, but from what I understand, other cameras should be just fine and I haven&rsquo;t heard that in any other video I&rsquo;ve seen from the camera.The camera is pretty compact overall, partially due to the fact that the GPS antenna is external. I like the mostly black case of the camera so that it&rsquo;s not too visible to others outside. However, it has a silver ring around the lens which I wish was all black as well for stealthiness. Unfortunately that&rsquo;s not easy to cover up with black tape or anything. It has a white light that you can turn on on the front, but that&rsquo;s kind of pointless. When it&rsquo;s driving, there&rsquo;s otherwise no giveaway LED lighting up to let others know you have a camera which is great.Image quality is great during the day. It&rsquo;s on par with my GoPros. The images are more saturated and more heavily sharpened than with other cameras. I guess they&rsquo;re trying to make everything look good out of camera. At night it does a better job at seeing in the dark shadows thanks to its WDR (wide dynamic range) feature which is turned on by default. I did a whole video on this so you can see the difference it makes with the feature on and off, as well as comparing it with a GoPro Hero4 Black. Take a look. (&hellip;)The text on screen looks good as well. Some camera text looks cheesy and cheap, but this one&rsquo;s looks good. The text looks clean.This camera doesn&rsquo;t have a parking mode feature. If you like you can use a device like a Power Magic Pro to let you run the camera without draining the battery if you want parking capabilities.The camera has a motion sensor feature, but it kind of sucks. Take a look at my video review (link posted at the beginning of this written review) for more info. In short, it misses the first few seconds of something going by. It also causes issues when driving in stop-and-go traffic with the camera constantly shutting off when things get still. You can&rsquo;t easily switch over to use this feature only when parked versus when driving. But hey, given that this camera isn&rsquo;t designed for being used when parking, it&rsquo;s understandable.The camera comes with an 8 gb MicroSD card which is good for about 1hr 20 min of recording before it starts overwriting old footage. That&rsquo;s not much so you&rsquo;ll definitely want to upgrade to a larger card. The most it supports is 32 gb which will give you ~5.5 hrs of recording time. I wish it supported 64 or 128. Either way, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to get a larger card or even several. I usually keep 2-3 cards in my car. If you pop the card out to take home and load on your computer, it&rsquo;s all too easy to forget it when you go back to your car. If you don&rsquo;t have your card, your camera won&rsquo;t record. So you&rsquo;ll want to grab a backup from your glove box. Here&rsquo;s the recommended 32 gb MicroSD Card. A quick note about the memory cards. If you forget your card, the camera will give you a visual indication on the LCD, but it won&rsquo;t beep at you to warn you so it&rsquo;s easy to miss the fact that you don&rsquo;t have a card in your camera so keep that in mind!The software is pretty nice too. It&rsquo;s available for Windows and Mac. It&rsquo;s simple and clean. Because you configure the camera in the camera itself, you don&rsquo;t have all the options in software to change things so it&rsquo;s simpler than some other software packages from other manufacturers. I also like that it shows you on a map not only where you are at this point in time in the video, but also the entire track that you drove. (If you&rsquo;re recording in 3 minute clips, it will only show you that 3 minute section.) There are a few quirks like how you can only load one video at a time (annoying if you have multiple clips to load), but it somehow embeds the GPS data in the video file itself. This is nice so you can rename the video clip to something more useful without breaking things, having the software not be able to correlate the video file with the GPS track, and it&rsquo;s just one less thing to have to manage afterwards.Overall it&rsquo;s a pretty great camera. I think they did a good job with the video and audio quality (weird audio issue I had aside), I like that the camera can rotate, I like the way the status LED looks and how the text looks, I wish it supported larger memory cards and that the front ring around the lens was all black, I like how the video files and GPS data is all integrated, and I like the customer service when I contacted them afterwards about the return. They handled it very well and were very accommodating. I get now why it has so many great reviews on Amazon. :)If it wasn&rsquo;t for the audio issue, the silver ring around the lens, and the inability to support larger memory cards, I&rsquo;d seriously contemplate keeping it. In the meantime I&rsquo;m taking a look at a lot of different dashcams to review them. You can see all my dashcam videos and reviews here if you like: (&hellip;)Thanks for reading and watching! :)</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-one-to-get">This is the one to get!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did a lot of research on dash cams before I made this purchase. I&rsquo;m glad I went with the KDLinks X1. Easy to install and use, and they have some cool software that you can install on your computer that shows average speed, actual speed, and a map that shows the route. It also records sound (you can shut this off) so you can record your singing as you drive. Comes with an 8 GB memory card, but I&rsquo;m getting a larger card (max 32 GB) so I don&rsquo;t have to unload it so often. Pretty good clarity even at night.I would definitely recommend this cam if you are serious about dash cams for your car!8-21-2015 Update:Funny thing happened yesterday on the way home from work. This guy decided to cross the street against the light and I had to hit the brakes hard to not hit him. He stood there and started yelling at me and giving me the finger. I pointed at my camera and he turned around and walked back to the sidewalk and away from me. The video was awesome and because of the wide view of the camera it also showed that the green light was on when he was crossing. Glad I had the camera!8-23-2015 Update:To hide the camera better I moved it to the passenger side. The lens is offset so it&rsquo;s not a big deal and the mount allows you to turn the camera (up/down, left/right) so you can still get a very wide view out the front window. I also used painters tape and a marker to conceal it even more. I covered the light on the front (not needed) and the KDLinks logo (sorry!) with the tape then colored it in to make the front all black. Very hard to see from the front since the mirror is behind it and it&rsquo;s black. You can see in the picture what I did.I also bought a cigarette lighter extender plug. I didn&rsquo;t want to use the plug in the ash tray since it has to always be open and I can&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;dish&rdquo; in front of the ashtray when it&rsquo;s open. The problem is the other 12v plug is always on. So I got an extender/splitter with on/off buttons. I route the camera cord to this and now when I park I just have to reach over and hit the power button. One time I forgot to do this and I got a lot of tape when I was not there. I&rsquo;m thinking about leaving this on in crowded parking lots in case I get hit or someone tries to do something.Still loving the camera!</p>

<h5 id="the-video-quality-is-good-however-there-is-an-issue-with-the-camera">The video quality is good, however there is an issue with the camera &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The video quality is good, however there is an issue with the camera frequently not turning on when the car starts up. Also, the camera showing &ldquo;Insert SD card&rdquo; when the SD card has not been removed or touched. When this occurs, it does not record and I have to manually turn the camera off, unplug it, plug it back in and hope it starts recording. It is too unreliable for a dash camera. The camera does not automatically start about 25% of the time. I contacted their customer service, and they suggested to try the provided 8GB card and format it in the camera, I did this and the issue still remains.I have unknowingly driven without the camera recording several times because of this issue, and that defeats the purpose of having a dash cam. I am going to look for a more reliable camera. I expected more from one of the most expensive dash cams in the Amazon marketplace.</p>
