<h5 id="big-boy-pants">Big boy pants!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This drill set is awesome! Moved into my first apartment so thought it was time to put on my big boy pants and buy my own tools instead of borrowing them from friends or family it&rsquo;s far from name brand and if you have idea about tools or work with them you can definitely tell the difference. But this set allows you to do %90 of the jobs around the house without busting the bank. Well made and the battery hold its charge for awhile. The drill bits are low quality as I said before but they work as long as you aren&rsquo;t careless or ruff with them. This is the little drill that could so if the screw or whatever it be is in the don&rsquo;t try and force it down more because you will strip the bit or break the drill neck.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-alternative-to-name-brands-nice-that-it-comes-with-drill-bits">Great alternative to name brands - nice that it comes with drill bits</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheaper than the brand name alternatives, but perfect for light duty and picture hanging around the house. I&rsquo;m not really all that handy, but a drill was something I wanted to add to my generic tool kits and random hand-me-downs from my father. I certainly didn&rsquo;t need anything too fancy, but I wanted it to have enough power so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to buy another down the road. I&rsquo;ve never heard of Genesis, but I trusted the reviews and I&rsquo;m glad I did.The drill is easy to operate with clear instructions for a newbie like me on how to use the chuck and what the different options mean. The battery charges fast and is easy to remove and plug into the charging cord. Sure the drill bits it came with aren&rsquo;t top of the line, but they work fine for me and it was better than having to buy them separately. The LED light is a bit hokey, as are the levels which can be tough to see, but overall this works great for the price.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-great-appears-to-be-good-quality-for-the-price">Works great. Appears to be good quality for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. Appears to be good quality for the price. I bought it when moving into my first apartment. So far I&rsquo;ve used it maybe 20 times for all sorts of tasks. From hanging a simple paper towel dispenser to hanging my 55&rdquo; HDTV to the wall. I&rsquo;ve even used it to assembled 2 nightstands and one table. It has performed very fell so far. I am very happy I bought this. Recommended to friends &amp; family already.READ MORE</p>

<p>I purchased this for the built in bubble level and price. This make my second Genesis drill and they both are good quality. I installed solar lights on an old tree stump and used the bubble level to make sure the holes were vertical. They look great.READ MORE</p>

<p>Worked right out of the box&hellip;.did not have t charge the battery first&hellip;.this is a light duty drill&hellip;bits are OK if you are careful with them&hellip;have not recharged the battery yet so I cannot comment on battery holding charge problems others have written about&hellip;up to now, this is a good value for the money for light household work&hellip;this is not a professional level drill or the included drill bits.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="got-what-i-paid-for">Got what I paid for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building a little spice rack for your mother, then this might be the drill for you. If you&rsquo;re building something heavy-duty, something that could support human weight, then spend the $$ for something more professional. This looked like a good deal for the price, but it turned out that it didn&rsquo;t have the power I needed for my project and I ended up having to upgrade to something stronger. Would have given this three stars, but the charger stopped working after 2 weeks, and one of the drill bits broke pretty easily. Maybe it was just my luck.Remember that cheap tools can sometimes cost you more in the long run.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-love-this-drill-for-the-price">Absolutely love this drill for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely love this drill for the price. The bits that come with it are total crap but the drill is awesome! Plenty of power.Update Feb 2017. Battery does no hold a charge anymore. I thought the battery would have lasted longer than 2 year especially when I dont use this drill nearly as much as my dewalt. It&rsquo;s a great drill when it is charged though. Opened up the battery and it appears that some of the parts were manufactured in 2005 so I assume they use used internal batteries to save money.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="can-t-complain-for-the-cost">Can&rsquo;t complain for the cost</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the cost, can&rsquo;t complain. Bought this because it was less expensive than getting a replacement battery for my DeWalt.It&rsquo;s not exceptionally strong but it gets the job done. If I need a powerhouse I have a corded drill for that.It only comes with one battery and a pretty cheesy Micky Mouse charging cap setup that sits on the end of the battery and you need to try and guess the time and unplug it on your own to prevent overcharging. The indicator lights don&rsquo;t do anything, they are just on all the time.It even has a light on the front, which is pretty neat and works randomly.Yes my buddy razzes me about it and asks what toy store I got it from (he has an awesome $200 Hitachi drill that beats this in every way but price, but it better for that much) but it gets the (small) job done when I need it and don&rsquo;t want to monkey around with the corded drill, and have given up on charging the DeWalt each time I need to use it.Don&rsquo;t expect much, and it will be fine. Can&rsquo;t beat it for the price. Yes it would be nice if it had 2 batteries, and definitely could use a better charger, but it still feels like you get more than you pay for. I&rsquo;m sure it will be disposable and if it lasts a year or so I really won&rsquo;t have any any grounds to complain, like I said the whole thing was less money than a replacement battery for my old Dewalt. This is 18V vs the Dewalt 14.4, and the Dewalt is stronger despite less voltage, but it also costs several times more.READ MORE</p>
