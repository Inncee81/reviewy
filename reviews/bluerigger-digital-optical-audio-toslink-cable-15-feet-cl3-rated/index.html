<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-cable-does-the-job">Excellent cable does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>[11/9/2016]I bought this cable as part of a home theater upgrade (along with a new HD projector, a ViewHD 4x2 HDMI matrix switch, and a set of Twisted Veins HDMI cables). When video is directed to the projector, audio needs to be sent separately to the sound system. This cable does the job perfectly. It also contributed to the removal of almost a dozen other cables (primarily numerous video and audio cables).I would buy this product again. and I recommend it to you. In fact, I am planning to get at least one more of these cables (for the DVD player).[4/14/2017]I just bought another one. Good cable, great seller, reasonable price, highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="great-cable-my-speakers-were-making-a-crackling-noise">Great cable, my speakers were making a crackling noise &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cable, my speakers were making a crackling noise on my tv. Wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if it was the cable or interference. For the price of these cables I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot. This cable is is about twice a thick as the one that came with my speakers but the jacks are the same. Took care of the problem immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-optical-cable">Solid Optical Cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to say about this as it&rsquo;s an optical cable, but for the price it seems to be well made and fits my needs perfectly. The ends and cable seem pretty durable as well as they seem to be more heavy duty than most default cables that come with different products. I bought 3 of these and used one for my sound bar and will use another to replace the stock one for my Astro A50 headset as the one that came with it is a little short and pretty flimsy compared to these ones. The last one I originally planned on having as a spare just in case, but I may try to use it for my PC if my speakers have an optical connection.For cables, they were pretty well packaged/protected. The ends had caps on them and were wrapped neatly in their bags. I think most, if not all, cables have the caps, but it&rsquo;s nice to see companies try to protect their products until customers get them. I&rsquo;ve only been using one of them for about a week and it&rsquo;s been working perfectly fine so far. The length is pretty good as well. At 6 feet, I think that would fit most peoples needs as well. My sound bar is literally right in front of my TV so I only needed about a foot at most, but for people who have it a little farther away or want to use the cable for other applications the extra length should come in handy.If I have any issues going forward I will update this, but as of right now they work just fine and I would recommend them to anyone who wants/needs one or more of these.</p>

<h5 id="throw-out-your-old-freebie-optical-cables-and-get-new-ones-you-ll-be-glad">Throw out your old freebie optical cables and get new ones, you&rsquo;ll be glad.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Throw out your old cheapo Toslink cables and get some of these. I had accumulated an assortment of optical cables that came free with audio/video equipment over the years. Never even thought of replacing them. When I needed just one more I finally bought these and WOW, what a world of difference in the sound! The best way to describe it is the absence of stridency in high frequencies. Previously, I simply attributed this distortion to &ldquo;digital&rdquo; reproduction idiosyncrasies. The old cables had been around a long time, through many moves, so its possible they may have been smashed, bent or otherwise compromised, even though they &ldquo;looked&rdquo; good. Or maybe these new cables are simply better, who knows.My only complaint with the plug design is that there is no way to tell if the end is oriented up or down. As you know, when you are reaching behind your equipment and fending off dust bunnies in the dark you need to know which way is up. But this is a minor quibble.Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="modification-may-be-required-if-using-with-visio-50-led-tv">Modification May Be Required If Using With Visio 50&rdquo; LED TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 15&rsquo; BlueRigger Digital Optical Audio Cable to connect to my receiver, a Visio 50&rdquo; LED TV. The TV is wall mounted, and its optical digital port is accessed from the rear of the set. The port resides alongside the HDMI ports under a &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; perpendicular to the rear of the set. Meaning, to plug the optical audio cable in, it must enter the port from below the shelf, and parallel to the screen. Unfortunately, this cable would not &ldquo;latch-in&rdquo;. It would almost make connection, but fall out without clicking into the small port opening(socket). Close inspection showed that the soft rubber shroud at the cable end was too large in diameter to allow the cable terminal to fully enter the socket. Carefully trimming away <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; of the shroud allowed the terminal enough clearance to engage in the optical audio port, and let the terminal &ldquo;clicked in&rdquo;. Function of the cable has been fine, but unless you are prepared to make this modification, and are trying to use with a similar Visio TV, you might want to consider a cable without such a generous rubber shroud.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-sound">Awesome sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After purchasing a new TV last year I discovered that the new TV didn&rsquo;t have RCA audio outs anymore. Since my home theater system didn&rsquo;t accept Digital audio, I had to connect the audio from the cable box to the home theater system. The sound wasn&rsquo;t as good and it didn&rsquo;t sync with the TV as well. After getting a new sound bar last month I hooked up the RCA cables again and then ordered the BlueRigger Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable. The sound is so much better than the RCA cables sound. The sound is rich and fills the room. The TV and the soundbar are perfectly in sync and I don&rsquo;t have to mute the TV to hear the soundbar properly. I highly recommend this audio cable to anyone looking to improve their audio system. The cable seems well made and sturdy and was super easy to connect. The setup was complete within a minute. I would buy more of these but I don&rsquo;t have any other TV&rsquo;s that hook up to compatible sound systems.</p>

<h5 id="engineering-issue">Engineering issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this cable looking at the great reviews. Had good experience with bluerigger before, but this cable is not. The loose fitted connector will cause the decoder to produce occasional noise in the audio, due to light leaking perhaps? I didn&rsquo;t know this was possible until I switched this cable out with an old cheap optical cable that came with a sound card. The cheap looking one fitted perfectly and produced crackling free sound. Nailed the problem down to the cable. This one needs to go back to the drawing board, good looking quality but cheap in actual use&hellip; I use it to connect an apple tv to a 5.1 wireless sub/sat soundbar.</p>
