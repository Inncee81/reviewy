<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-great-deal">A great deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple bicycle computer with the basic functions, which was all I wanted. Installation wasn&rsquo;t quite as easy for me as written in some reviews. The instructions were somewhat confusing, but a quick search online revealed an excellent video describing how to install these and this was very helpful. It works great, the display is very easy to read, and it&rsquo;s easy to rotate through the various displays. For the price this is tough to beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed and worked fine. So far so good,excellent cycling computer! Very quality nice! Very good value for money if it lasts.The most important to originally correct number wheel size, I have the first two times the distance from the phone, is not achieved data. My wheel diameter is 3,14 (I had an error in 465 meters 15 km).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-speedometer-for-my-bike">Excellent speedometer for my bike</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a tiny speedometer for my bike. It is very nice and easy to install. Directions are not very clear but I had no issues getting it to work. It looks very nice mounted to my mountain bike. On display I can clearly see the speed and the miles ridden. I like it a lot and highly recommend it. When I&rsquo;m buying something, I&rsquo;m always checking the reviews for that item and I always leave honest reviews for others as well. If you think my review is helpful, please click it below.</p>

<h5 id="wireless-and-it-works">Wireless and it works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this speedometer/odometer to mainly to measure the miles I had ridden. The instructions for installation weren&rsquo;t very clear and were a little confusing and they are for a wireless as well as wired bike computer. Also, while it tells you to put on the double-stick pad on the bottom of the display piece, it doesn&rsquo;t tell you to do so with the sensor piece, that which I only realized after I had used the zip ties to attach the sensor to the bike. Another thing I did not understand was the tracks on the magnet for the spokes were parallel, rather then V-shape, so they didn&rsquo;t really fit, hence I only installed one spoke in one of the tracks. All that aside, the device works fine once you set up the position of the magnet and the sensor. It is great that it is wireless (so there are no dangling wires) and the display can be removed/slid off its console so that it can avoid the harsher elements. The display is clear and easy to read. I measured the distance in miles which I rode against the map and it is mostly correct. There is also a clock feature so it tells time which I find useful and it was nice to see the speed at which I was going while I was riding.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-set-up-and-more-accurate-than-my-gps">Easy to set up and more accurate than my GPS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to set up and more accurate than my GPSThe GPS obviously has position location, but this has much better distance calculation since it keeps track of distance right at the wheel.This thing is super easy to set up. The instructions are clear and have pictures. The main thing to get right is the magnet and the sensor must be close or else it won&rsquo;t register the spin.I love that it keep track of my overall distance, and also my current trip distance. It does the same thing with the time spent biking.Highly recommended! Enjoy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-speedometer-for-cycling">Nice speedometer for cycling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When cycling becomes a habit, you would like to get some more accessories for it just like other sports or driving. This is a nice speedometer that can keep track of the time that you spent in cycling and also the distance you cycled. It is also nice to measure the distance between two points via cycling.Technically, it is also recommended for those on fitness program that need to know the time and distance spent in the cycling.Installation is simple and straightforward, especially this is a wireless one that the sensor and the magnet are installed on the fork and inside the wheel, no wires need to run back to the computer.Standard features like odometer, distance, timer and the like are in the computer and even backlight is automatically turn on whenever a hit on any button during dusk to dawn via the clock.A recommended accessory for cyclists!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fix-for-old-school-bike">Great fix for old school bike!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased for an old school Tunturi Ergometer W that was obtained with a broken speedometer. A replacement Tunturi speedometer and cable were discontinued so this option seemed like a can&rsquo;t miss..Setup was easy and I drilled into the cast wheel and mounted the magnet&hellip;Works so very well and starts up once the magnet crosses the monitor mounted on the fork&hellip;Love the timer function as well even though the windup timer on the bike still performs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-i-plan-to-buy-2-more-for-my-other-bikes">Excellent product, I plan to buy 2 more for my other bikes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product - works as advertised. I only wanted 3 things: Speedometer, Odometer, and elapsed trip time. Comes with a bunch of other features I haven&rsquo;t even checked out yet, but may appeal to more fanatical (or shall we say devoted) bikers.The sensor needs to be within <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch to get consistent readings - mine was initially a little further out and speed would switch between 15mph to 7 or 8mph, then back to 15, so it was clearly just barely reading it. Shifted it a little closer, and works fine all the time now. (Luckily I missed the step of putting the double stick tape under the sensor when I mounted it or it would not have been so easy to adjust).I asked the company to email be electronic (pdf) copy of the manual and they did - 2 versions, plus an additional jpg. Very happy with their quick response. I clearly would recommend this anyone, and will buy again for my 2 other bikes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mounts broke within an hour, my husband is an electrical engineer and just mounted a similar more expensive one on his bike and couldn&rsquo;t get this one to work</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="large-clear-screen-with-backlight">Large clear screen with backlight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All settings done. Works great after adjust to right positions of magnet and sensor. Has backlight and waterproof function.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well, however it is awkward to program</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-re-looking-for-an-affordable-option-for-your-bicycle-stop-here-because-you-ve-found-it">If you&rsquo;re looking for an affordable option for your bicycle, stop here because you&rsquo;ve found it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very clear and easy to use! I would highly recommend it to others that are looking for a no frills bicycle speedometer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bicycling-is-fun-and-my-friend-recently-got-this-for-her">Bicycling is fun. And my friend recently got this for her &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bicycling is fun. And my friend recently got this for her bike so she can keep track of fun exercise as she is trying to stay super fit. And looking at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-for-the-price">Okay for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price it&rsquo;s fine, but mine rattles as if there were gears moving.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-only-fault-i-can-find-is-that-more">The only fault I can find, is that more &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only fault I can find, is that more spacers are required to allow correct alignment of the pickups. I had to make my own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-and-does-everything-it-promised">Great and does everything it promised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Being using it for 2 weeks now and its great and does everything it promised to do. Has all the basic functions of riding. Easy to control with only two buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great Purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great purchase. very easy to fit onto my bicycle and easy to set up. I use it to check my gps tracks for time and distance and so far they match.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-hardware-part-is-excellent-the-problem-is-with-the-documentation">The hardware part is excellent. The problem is with the documentation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this for about a month. The hardware part is excellent. The problem is with the documentation. The chart for tire circumference do not list the larger tires.</p>
