<h5 id="an-awesome-home-theater-and-gaming-projector">An Awesome Home Theater and Gaming Projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The other reviewer stating that this projector is junk obviously has some ulterior motives and has never seen this projector. Or he has seen it and is associated with the competition. Hands down, this is one of the best projectors on the market and worth more than the $1,000 I paid for it. I owned the HD25-LV and the HD26 and the HD37 is FAR superior to both. I wanted the 161, but since I&rsquo;m an avid FPS gamer (Hardline on PS4), the high input lag was a deal breaker for me. Since I&rsquo;m a big fan of Optoma I decided to wait to see what was coming next. I&rsquo;m glad I did. The 37 uses the same hardware as the 161 and 50 but integrated much of the Pure Motion component into the core video processing itself so high lag is no longer an issue. Everything is crisp and quick. Right out of the box the colors POP with vivid boldness and the picture motion is as fluid and natural as silk. And the glass lens made a tremendous difference. The picture is scalpel sharp. My wife noticed the picture difference immediately. Now it really looks like I have a giant LCD TV instead of a projector. And the lens tension is extra tight to make sure it holds its position. This is a big deal if you&rsquo;re running multiple powerful subwoofers as I learned with the other 2 projectors. Over time the picture would vibrate out of focus so we had to tape it in place to keep the picture perfect. No more. And The 3D? Insane. Everyone was stunned. Using the ZF2300 glasses and BC300 RF emitter, we will NEVER go to a movie theater again. Waiting on the 3D bluray to come out is well worth the wait. Perfect 3D picture, color, clarity, and depth. It&rsquo;s that good. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on DLP-Link. Although more expensive, RF is the best investment you can make for the ultimate 3D experience. And my Darbee enhanced all of this eye candy even more. Now coupling the HD37 with the awesome Onkyo, Polk and SVS 9.4 sound system we&rsquo;ve put together for our home theater experience, we have finally completed our setup. A commercial theater can&rsquo;t even come close to our home experience. So yes, we are all extremely satisfied with the HD37. Make the investment, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p>Blows away the projector I was using! I bought this to replace an Infocus IN116 that was projected on a 120in dropdown screen. The Optoma supposedly has a lower lumen rating than the Infocus but, is far brighter. We usually watch movies in the early evening (around 6pm) on the projected screen with blackout curtains over the windows to get the best picture. I got the HD37 in the morning and couldn&rsquo;t wait to get it setup and calibrated! I had it installed by 11am and we watched some HD test footage and the HD37 was drastically different from the IN116! The HD37 had far brighter colors and far less motion blur on the out of the box settings. Once I change a few settings to my liking, the HD37 made the IN116 look like a kid’s toy. I have it ceiling mounted right above the sitting area and during the movie the fan noise wasn&rsquo;t noticeable at all. The only time I really noticed it was during complete silence (which is rare in most movies). The IN116 was much louder so it&rsquo;s nice not having the movie sound washed out with white noise. The Vertical Lens Shift was a very nice feature I didn&rsquo;t notice when I was researching the HD37 for purchase. I also like the remote backlight and easy menu setup. I haven&rsquo;t taken the time to fine tune the picture because I like the &ldquo;reference&rdquo; setting in the video preset. This projector was also a step up in resolution from the IN116 (1280 x 800) so having native 1080p is amazing.For Reference: The pictures are to give you an idea of how it is mounted and how bright the HD37 is on a 120” screen, from 13 ½ feet away, with the blackout curtains open on a slightly overcast day and with the curtains closed (FYI the movie was paused for the photo). The IN116 wasn&rsquo;t viewable at all with the curtains open.The one thing I&rsquo;m super excited to try is the 3D but I need to order active 3d glasses. I will update once I have tried it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a long series or projectors over the last 20+ years. Each one has been an upgrade, but this one is the biggest upgrade from the previous generation. This is also the first one that can be watched reasonably in a room with ambient light. My previous one, the Panasonic PT-AE700, had a nice picture but if the curtains weren&rsquo;t closed at night the street light would spoil part of the image and if there was any ambient light in the room the picture wasn&rsquo;t very visible. With this projector, having the lights on in the room the image is still bright and clear. This is also the quietest projector I&rsquo;ve owned. Is it silent? No, but if there&rsquo;s any audio playing it&rsquo;s not making itself obvious. It&rsquo;s rated the same noise level as my previous projector but this one is definitely more quiet.I have it mounted on a high shelf in the back of the room. It&rsquo;s not designed for that unfortunately, it&rsquo;s meant to be aligned at the bottom of the image, or from the top if it is upside down with a ceiling mount. My solution was to set it upside-down on the shelf (no vents are blocked and no buttons will be pressed) and then use two rubber door stops to adjust the elevation and level of the image.I haven&rsquo;t tried the 3D yet because my receiver is only HDMI 1.2a so I&rsquo;ll update this when I spend more money on A/V gear. :-)</p>
