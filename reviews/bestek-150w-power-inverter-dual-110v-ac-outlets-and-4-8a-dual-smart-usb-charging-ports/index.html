<h5 id="very-quiet-inverter-with-useful-usb-charging-ports">Very quiet inverter with useful USB charging ports!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this to use in the RV while doing lots of photography. Needed to power my 17 inch Samsung i7 laptop, with a 220 watt power supply. This unit did very well while either running the laptop (batteries fully charged) or charging the batteries in the laptop (computer off). If I had run the laptop batteries down and was doing serious work editing or moving photos between drives, the inverter would cut off, and I would have to toggle the power switch on the back of the inverter to start it up again. I eventually got used to charging my laptop up fully before using it to with the inverter, and the inverter was able to keep the laptop running without a hitch. It may have been an issue with the 12 volt supply circuit. I didn&rsquo;t run the inverter on a known high amperage 12 volt circuit in the RV, so I am not deducting a star for that.There is a quiet fan that is always on when the switch in the back is turned on. It is quiet enough that I was easily able to sleep with the fan running in very quiet campsites. The volume and pitch of the fan are unobtrusive.As others have noted, the USB ports are always powered if the inverter is plugged into the 12 volt supply, independent of the position of the power switch on the back. I like this very much, since I can charge my iPhone or Kindle with the fan turned off if I am not using the 110 volt section.A really excellent value!</p>

<h5 id="meets-my-needs-seems-to-meet-all-advertised-specifications">Meets my needs, seems to meet all advertised specifications.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it! I bought this to power a TV and IPTV box in my RV without running the generator, about a 180w load. The fan is audible, but barely noticeable in anything other than a library-like setting. Build quality seems perfectly reasonable for the price. I&rsquo;d recommend it for any application where it&rsquo;ll put out enough power. In the instructions, Bestek recommends not using a cigar lighter outlet for loads over 150w. At my current draw, I did not blow the outlet fuse, nor did the 12v wire seem warmer than room temp. Other users who choose to ignore the manual should have spare fuses available, and check the wire temperature during use to prevent unwanted drama.</p>

<h5 id="great-power-inverter-at-a-great-price-silent-operation">Great power inverter at a great price! SILENT operation!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this inverter to run a 24&rdquo; Element TV and a Dell XPS 13 laptop while dry-camping in my 19-foot travel trailer.First Impressions:Though it may seem inconsequential, the packaging of an item is one of the first things I look at. I was completely satisfied with Bestek&rsquo;s packaging of the inverter. It seemed high-quality, and the inverter was well-packed inside its box to prevent damage. Additionally, it was very easy to open, and required no scissors, knife, or other tools, unlike the Belkin inverter I had purchased about a year ago.Setup:Setup is a no-brainer, even for someone who is not technical at all. Just plug it in to a 12 volt outlet (such as a cigarette lighter outlet in your car, or, in my case, a 12v wall outlet in my RV), flip the switch on the back of the inverter, and you have AC power.Use:The inverter is rated at 150 watts, which I have not fully tested. My 24&rdquo; LED-backlit LCD television is rated at 30 watts, and my Dell XPS 13 is rated at 45 watts maximum. Therefore, these two devices should not draw more than 75 watts, or about half the capacity of the inverter. With these two devices running, the inverter had no trouble at all. I also plugged my LG G4 in to the inverter, and it charged just fine. I don&rsquo;t know if it was just a fluke, but my LG G4 did charge at a 1.9 amp rate, according to the Ampere app, but I understand other reviewers had trouble getting their devices to charge at more than 1 amp.I obviously did not disassemble this inverter to check, but if there is a fan in the unit, I have never heard it, and I have used it for three or four hours at a stretch running at approximately half of its rated capacity.One Quick Note:Like nearly all sub-$100 power inverters, this inverter uses a modified sine wave output. I have personally not experienced any issues with this, but modified sine wave may harm sensitive electronic equipment, or cause it to not function properly temporarily. This may be apparent as visible lines on a television screen, excessive noise from motor-driven equipment, or power adapters for laptops or other electronics running slightly hotter or emitting a slight humming. This is NOT a problem unique to this inverter, but, rather, a problem unique to all budget-minded inverters.Conclusion:It&rsquo;s great to see a small, compact power inverter like this with two AC outlets AND two USB ports, especially with such silent operation. As long as you stay within its capabilities, this power inverter would make a great emergency device, or use it on a road trip to keep everyone&rsquo;s devices charged up. Furthermore, if you are using this for an RV, it should work beautifully, as it has in my instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to use for blowing up the air mattress while camping at non electrical sites. Used this past weekend without any issues. Will update this review if we have any issues but for now would recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-but-not-so-ultra-quiet">Good value, but not so ultra quiet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works fine, like the two outlets and USB plugs, this is a good value.However I gave it three stars as I feel these are important points.Two issues- this is described as &ldquo;ultra silent cooling fan &rdquo; Though It&rsquo;s not loud, it is definitely not silent. I could easily hear it above the car noise, in fact I thought at first the sound was from the car ventilation. And the fan came on just using the USB ports, very little power draw, I could understand it if came on with a real power load, even 10 watts on AC, but we&rsquo;re talking charging a phone.All plastic construction- seems OK, but not sure how well it will hold up stored in a car.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didn-t-last-long">Didn&rsquo;t last long. ;(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate things that stop working after a short amount of time. I have had this about 6-7 months. It is used a couple times a week. Not often enough for it to stop working. It won&rsquo;t charge now. So if you want to &ldquo;rent&rdquo; this for 7 months before it cuts out for $17.99 the go ahead. But I&rsquo;m disappointed they quit out so quickly. It shouldn&rsquo;t be. Then that&rsquo;s just money thrown away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="satisfied-in-san-antonio">Satisfied in San Antonio</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought one in June. The power plugs stopped working beginning of August, the usb connectors still functioned though. It was strange. I contacted Bestek and they are replacing the unit free of charge, even though their replacement policy is only for 30 days. Nice to buy from a company willing to make things right even if the product stops working shortly after the period for returns has ended.</p>
