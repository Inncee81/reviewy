<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The ArmorSuit Military shield for my Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is a great product. All necessary equipment to install this screen protector properly is provided too (spray bottle with liquid, squeegee, micro fiber cloth, instructions). More importantly, this screen protector came as and performs as the seller described. It is hard to tell that it is even on my tablet. It has zero effect on my tablet&rsquo;s S-Pen functions. I was so pleased with this product that I recommended it to three friends. Unfortunately they all asked me to install their&rsquo;s for them (smile). Fortunately this company provides an easy to follow video for installation (in addition to the easy to follow written instructions). All four installations turned out great! I highly recommend this product for anyone who is shopping for a screen protector for their tablet.</p>

<h5 id="the-support-team-was-awesome-they-replaced-the-material-within-a-few-days">The support team was awesome! They replaced the material within a few days &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased thsi product for my mother-in-laws Tab Pro device. I have used the ArmorSuit product in the past on my iPhone and Samsung Note. I installed the product per instructions and ran into a section where it appeared to be a tab bit foggy. I believe this was due to me pulling the material back to realign. I must not have had enough liquid on the material. I rate this product 5 stars, because sometimes as customers, we make mistakes. What ArmorSuit support did was offer to replace the product by having me send it in or emailing them a picture of the issue. The support team was awesome! They replaced the material within a few days and I&rsquo;m going to reinstall it again this weekend. If you want a great product but really care about the support of the company, ArmorSuit is the product to buy! Like I mentioned earlier, the product is great and it works awesome on my other devices. I also wanted to mention that my s-pen seems to have no effect on this screen. It works as well as it did before, but I am not the type of person that pushes the pen down hard either.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-give-this-six-stars-if-i-could">I would give this six stars if I could</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, when you get the box in the mail your first thought is, &ldquo;I wish I could get somebody else to put this on.&rdquo; That was my first thought anyway. Well, I followed the instructions and was surprised how easy it was to put it on perfectly, without a single bubble, in about 10 minutes. It was way easier than I thought and with a 12.2&rdquo; tablet I was sure it was going to be much harder. It is so clear you can not tell it is there and EXTREMELY scratch resistant. I think it is well worth the price. I have had it on for about a month now and use my tablet constantly and suspect that the film should be good for quite a while. I am not sure what to make of screen protectors that claim to be military grade though. I suppose if war breaks out I can walk right through a fusillade of gunfire, just hold my Samsung tablet with it&rsquo;s military grade screen protector in front of me and I should be fine.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-does-not-interfere-with-s-pen">Good product, does not interfere with s-pen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had this product previously with my galaxy tab pro 12.2, lasted a long time with no issues, until I destroyed it by accident,&hellip; now I have a galaxy note pro 12.2 with the same product, &hellip; it&rsquo;s good,&hellip; After 24 hours when it&rsquo;s completely dry you can barely tell it&rsquo;s on,&hellip; does not interfere with the function of the s-pen after completely dry</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-promised-on-the-galaxy-note-12-2">Works as promised on the Galaxy Note 12.2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product fits the Samsung Galaxy Note 12.2 perfectly. The key is #1) Follow the Instructions #2) Do not worry about the solution hurting the device #3)Squeegee while the device is wet like the devices life depended on it 4)Be patient!! Because of how large the device screen is it does take about a day or 2 for the bubbles to work themselves out. Alignment while wet, squeegeeing and patient make this work. the absolutely only thing that may be improved is possibly a larger microfiber to soak up the solution. The one that came for this kit was suitable for the job but would be more suited to smartphone sized devices. Overall this product works. S-pen and Wacom Bamboo pen interactions are perfect. screen is crystal clear.</p>

<h5 id="armorsuit-militaryshield">ArmorSuit MilitaryShield</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These protectors are really wonderful. They are relatively easy to apply (watch the video&rsquo;s online) and make sure you let it dry. It fits well and is easy to clean. I use a cloth and electronic cleaner that we use for our TV&rsquo;s.This is my forth purchase of a ArmorSuit MilitaryShield for different devices. My first was on my Nook HD about 4 years ago and that still has the same protector and working well. I also have it on my phone and my daughters Galaxy tablet.I recommend these for anyone that doesn&rsquo;t want to have to replace they protector every couple of months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely perfect product. The instructional YouTube videos (the one for Tablets, here, <a href="http://www.armorsuit.com/screen-protector-tablet">http://www.armorsuit.com/screen-protector-tablet</a>) are excellent,and very clear, too. And, it&rsquo;s made in the U.S.A, so please support them. =:). You will be happy&hellip; no streaks, no bubbles. P.S.: Just a few days ago, I tried a competitor product (a dry version) and it failed&hellip;. I couldn&rsquo;t get the bubbles out no matter what I tried (and I tried three times with the three shields that that other product came with). But this one came with just one shield, and that&rsquo;s all I needed (and all you will need, too). I got it the first time. So my advice (based on experience), buy this one.My device: Samsung Galaxy Tap Pro 12.2</p>

<h5 id="great-screen-protector">Great Screen Protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen protector is cut to the exact size and cutouts of the device. Scary as it may seem, the wet application seems counter intuitive, but works great. This screen protector goes on very easily, as most wet application screen protectors do. Even though I may not have initially placed it on the screen &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo;, the alignment was right and looked great after being applied. Once the screen protector has had time to sit overnight and dry, it looks perfect. It has been clean and without any bubbling whatsoever. Really can&rsquo;t even tell it&rsquo;s on except for coffee spray and other things that you might have on your hands that transfer to the screen protector during everyday use. The nicest thing is, it cleans up well with no fuss. Definitely worth the money and peace of mind knowing your screen is protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-frankly-just-bad-screen-protector">and frankly just BAD screen protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just&hellip; a <em>bad</em> screen protector. The tempered glass has a tacky, thick texture that makes it difficult to use the touch screen, and IMPOSSIBLE to use the on-board S-pen&hellip;</p>

<p>I had to throw it away. It was the most difficult thing to try to put on my galaxy note pro.</p>
