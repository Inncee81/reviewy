<blockquote>
<p>I shopped for-seemingly ever trying to find a good deal on a fan with a remote. I&rsquo;m glad I bought this one.So the fan comes shipped in it&rsquo;s own box which is fully sufficient because it&rsquo;s packed nicely inside with bags and styrofoam blocks. My only gripe is that assembling it is a pain in the butt, you need a screwdriver (preferably a powered one!) because some of the screws go into plastic that is un-tapped (it&rsquo;s best that way it gets a better seal) but it might put a few people off who are not mechanically inclined, but anyone can do it, you just need a screwdriver. You also need two AAA batteries for the remote, the batteries are not included.Once assembled, the buttons are easy to figure out, and memorize, if you&rsquo;re like me, you bought this fan because it has a remote and you can change settings while you&rsquo;re in bed haha. The best thing about this fan, is the oscillate on/off button. When you press it it begins to oscilate in one direction like any normal fan, but if you press it again on and off, it oscillates in teh opposite direction, so you don&rsquo;t have to wait for it to make a full cycle - this is nice because you can pinpoint yourself with the fan from a distance (hey! own your laziness ^_^)There are 3 settings, low, med, and hi; the high is not &lsquo;SUPER FAN TURBINE ACTION&rsquo; or anything, but because it&rsquo;s a standing turbine fan it gives a great channeled sheet of air out. the timer settings are 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours, and you cycle through them with the button on the top or remote (there are LED indicators and a moderate BEEP sound with each button press even when using the remote). Each button makes a single &lsquo;BEEP&rsquo;, except when you first turn it on, it makes two beeps, and when you go from Low-Medium-High-Off; when you reach OFF it beeps a long beep. These indicators are helpful when you&rsquo;re pressing the remote and want to quickly make it work without having to listen for the actual fan noise. The oscillate button is on/off.Then there&rsquo;s this little hidden gem, there are two modes you can turn on &ldquo;Breeze&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo;. First set the power, low/med/hi, it uses that as a base level- for Breeze, it randomly changes the speed from what I could discern from about 5+ levels and sometimes goes more powerful than &lsquo;High&rsquo;, this is great for relaxing or working where it&rsquo;s not super hot. This mode has only one drawback: the randomly changing levels also randomly change the amount of noise coming from the fan, so it might get annoying if you&rsquo;re trying to get to sleep&hellip;That&rsquo;s where their &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo; mode comes in; so the sleep mode (with a little smiley face on a pillow icon) instead of going RANDOM CRAZINESS, goes gently up and down from a step above or below what its&rsquo; on AND gradually decreases as it does &lsquo;cycles&rsquo;. because the changes in speed are gradual, there is less &lsquo;abrupt&rsquo; noise, making it PERFECT for falling asleep to, hence the &lsquo;sleep&rsquo; name. The first night I used it I tried breeze and it literally woke me up as I was trying to fall asleep; then i tried the sleep mode and have been using it ever since.Okay so there you have it, the fan is dirt cheap for what you get, there&rsquo;s a little cavity in the back of it to store the remote if you don&rsquo;t want to lose it.Enjoy. :)UPDATE: 4/24/2014: The fan lasted 20 months, tonight it squealed a loud yowling noise, and stopped dead. tried cleaning it, powering it on it just spins very slowly and quietly buzzes, it&rsquo;s not stuck, the motor is just shot. The fan was used each night in the summer months last year, and for 3 months this year. I just seem to recall my parents keeping fans year after year for decades - they literally do not make em like they used to. these plastic throwaways are not designed to last. -2 starsUPDATE TO THE UPDATE!: This fan and most all Holmes fans carry a 3 Year Warranty from the Manufacturer (Jarden), after visiting their website and filling out the &lsquo;product support&rsquo; webform (which asks for the usual info, as well as two codes engraved on the power plug prongs) I received an immediate confirmation then a personal email from them within hours - offering to replace the product. they gave me a model number for a replacement (a comparable model with same features) and I confirmed that would be great, immediate response to that with shipping confirmation thanking me for my business, that the warranty for the original fan transfers to the new one, and that it would arrive at my doorstep in 6-8 business days. WOW. That is extremely good service and way beyond expectations (I thought I was going to have to ship the broken one to them). 5 stars, wow, great customer service!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan was great the first night.. however now it makes this very loud clicking nose. I wanted a fan so I could sleep better. Not so happy with what I got.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-good-fan-it-does-what-i-need-it-to">It&rsquo;s a good fan. It does what I need it to</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My fan of 8ish years died a slow and tragic death, so I replaced it with this. It&rsquo;s a good fan. It does what I need it to. There are some pros and cons though. Pros are: It&rsquo;s quiet. OMGosh, it&rsquo;s so quiet. I was able to lower my TV volume to what I usually keep it on in the winter. And the oscillating feature is on the remote, so I don&rsquo;t have to get up to make it turn or stop. My last fan didn&rsquo;t have that feature.Cons are: the air output isn&rsquo;t very strong. My old fan (which was a Holmes but round and oscillating) was more powerful. I used that one on setting 1. To get the same amount of air, this one has to be set to 2 or 3. Also, the base is plastic and it&rsquo;s a bit flimsy. It stands there just fine, but if you touch it, it rocks a bit.I&rsquo;d happily pay more if these companies would continue to use metal for things like fans and ditch the plastic.Overall though, it&rsquo;s a good fan. It does what I need.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it">I like it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to write a review because of the many low star reviews. I&rsquo;m really happy with this. I actually thought about buying a second one so I don&rsquo;t have to move it from living room to bedroom depending on where I am. But for now I carry it back and forth. (It has a handle for carrying in the back as well as a slot in the back to store the remote control.) I love the remote control. It does, when it gets to the furthest left oscillation make a small sound. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me and I am thinking it is just because I didn&rsquo;t secure the bottom all the way when I assembled it. I have never had a tower fan before and I love the small footprint. The settings, Low Medium and High are great and adequate, I never even use high. Some of the complaints were that the fan was not strong enough. Perhaps they have the fan in a larger room and expect it to blow through an entire large room. I use it about 7&rsquo; from me in both the living room and bedroom. As I said I use settings low and high. Overall I am really happy with it and glad I got it.</p>

<h5 id="great-fan-for-the-summer">Great Fan for the Summer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in a loft with poor natural ventilation from the window and a somewhat weak AC. This fan has been a fantastic alternative to cooling me off when the inside temperature has been averaging 85F and the humidity has been 50-80% here in Richmond, VA. Plus it&rsquo;s helped cut down energy costs from using the AC or apartment fan. The sleep mode is nice in that it slowly oscillates between off and on with some variance - although I wish the variance were greater (less sinusoidal and more random). The breeze is quite strong in a good way. I often set the fan to the lowest of the 3 intensities, about 6-7 feet from my bed while I sleep on top of the covers, and I find myself sometimes waking up just a little cold when my alarm goes off in the morning. The fan does make some sound naturally that can be heard in the dead of the night; but it&rsquo;s very soft and subtle.</p>

<h5 id="seems-like-a-decent-fan-thus-far-for-the-price">Seems like a decent fan thus far for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems like a decent fan thus far for the price, but it has a slight power surging issue it seems. The fan will be running normally and then get a higher gust for a few seconds, and then slow back down. I&rsquo;ve tried other outlets and have the same issue. I have other tower fans of other brands in the house and I&rsquo;m unable to emulate the issue with those. I&rsquo;m hoping the fan holds up, though. It does its job well for the most part and sometimes ends up making my room too cold, which is good for the Florida summer. The remote is very convenient.</p>

<h5 id="this-fan-was-great-for-the-6-months-or-so-that-it">This fan was great, for the 6 months or so that it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan was great, for the 6 months or so that it worked. Then it started making a weird sound and was very disturbing. I contacted the company, and after a few emails I was told I needed to call so they could hear the sound. Seriously?? When did customer service become this?!?!? It&rsquo;s not even a year old. No exchange option or anything. Thoroughly disappointed and will never order anything with the brand Holmes again.</p>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t blow much air out for the price. But overall it&rsquo;s okay I guess.</p>

<p>This fan was somewhat disappointing. First, it takes longer than 15-20 minutes to assemble. Figure about 30 minutes. What I don&rsquo;t like is the cheap base.</p>
