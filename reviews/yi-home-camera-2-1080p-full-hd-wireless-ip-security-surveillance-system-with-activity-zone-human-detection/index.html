<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="one-of-the-better-options-on-the-market">One of the better options on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera was easy to set up so far. It paired with WiFi in just a few minutes and was light enough to actually mount on the ceiling with the provided double-sided adhesive. The photo clarity is pretty good at 1080p and it is easy to switch between &ldquo;SD&rdquo; and &ldquo;HD&rdquo; modes when viewing. The refresh rate could be a bit better and sometimes the video skips as it catches up. Low light/dark capture is okay, nothing spectacular but at least the video is not too noisy.The app is one of the better ones I&rsquo;ve used. It is easy to configure remote access options and the PIN restriction is a nice feature. The provided SD slot supports up to 32GB according to the manual and the app says that can store 3 days worth of 1080p footage. The camera gets a bit hot so keep it in a cooler location (probably not an attic or in direct sunlight). The digital zoom is smooth however image rotation only supports 180 degrees. It would be nice to have a 90 degree rotation option.I have yet to try the motion capture alerts and alert zone features. Will play with that over the next few days.</p>

<h5 id="overall-a-good-product">Overall a good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to setup, no problem connecting the phone to the camera. Great picture as well as good response time on &ldquo;human detection&rdquo; in daylight and with the night vision. One more good point is that it allows for detail settings, one important one is to turn the light off on the camera housing while in operation. I prefer pan and tilt for surveillance cameras, however, the vision ankle on the camera is sufficient to cover any room with ease.Although the camera is good compared to some of the other products, the WiFi connection not so much. If the location has other, more solid material than drywall it is not possible to get a good connection unless you go through the painstaking exercise of relocating your WiFi router or install a repeater (which costs more than the camera). Second, storage. Even if only motion triggered alerts are stored the SD card holds immediate footage until it overrides it once the capacity is reached. Not so great for a long period of time. The only other way to store footage is through the YI cloud, which in the long run costs money.Overall it is a great product, I&rsquo;m happy with it for the purpose I needed it for. I can recommend it as long as you have a good connection throughout your house/apartment/condo/garage etc you will enjoy it.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-i-love-this-little-web-cam">So far I love this little web cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I love this little web cam. It delivers exceptionally well when I&rsquo;m home &amp; away from home. My son is autistic and needs supervision. Even though he&rsquo;s 17, my wife and I rarely leave him for over 30 minutes because we&rsquo;ve never had a window into his activities. Finally, with the Yi, we have the window we&rsquo;ve been needing. The two way intercom feature is awesome. I couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with this product than I am. I&rsquo;m only giving 4 stars because the name indicated there would be two cameras and I was disappointed only one arrived. I&rsquo;ll take partial blame here but felt misled during the buying process.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-hardware-and-software">Excellent hardware and software</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Every once in a while I am truly pleasantly surprised by the engineering design of a product and this is one of those times.Excellent hardware and software. Super easy to install (the camera actually talks you through it). Video quality and sound quality is excellent. Surprising how good the sound coming out of this unit is since it is quite small. Wide angle lens and nigh vision work very well. The quality of the lens is also quite good with no noticeable aberration at the edges. The software is well designed and easy to use yet has lots of features.At this price it is a no-brainer. The only down side is that sound and video has about a 1 second lag, but this is acceptable and expected for this type of camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-bad-customer-service">Great Product, bad customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice camera, very easy setup. If you have any questions, they don&rsquo;t have any customer service. I have sent questions to them asking them how I can change my password. During setup you choose a password, but that is it. Once it is set you can&rsquo;t change it so I asked how to do this, the most you get is the FAQ which of course doesn&rsquo;t address this issue. Other than that I do like the camera very much. During night mode, there is a lot of ghosting, tried switching to different rez didn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="multiple-flaws">Multiple flaws.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second YI Home Camera 2, 1080p that I bought. I returned the first one due to the issues listed below. I am returning this second one for exactly the same issues. I am listing the issues in level of priority/annoyance:1) This camera, unlike the 1080p home camera, produces an internal noise, similar to an interference sound. When the camera records, this noise is picked up by the microphone, gets amplified and recorded. Also, when you are using the intercom feature the noise is so high that you can barely hear all other sounds. I move the camera to different rooms but the noise won&rsquo;t go away. Other reviewers have pointed this issue out.2) When you are doing live view from your phone, if you happen to zoom, the camera freezes at exactly the point you zoom out. In order to &ldquo;un-freeze&rdquo; it you need to switch the video quality (either from SD to auto, or to HD, etc.). Very annoying. Other reviewers have pointed out that their cameras freeze also.3) Compare to other YI cameras, the WiFi reception for this camera is sub-par. This seems to be the biggest issue if you read at all the reviews. I have mine installed 3 feet from the Apple Airport Extreme router so my connection is Good (not excellent) but as you start moving it away, to other rooms for example, the connection is horrible. Please note that I have a total of 3 Apple Airport Extreme routers acting as WiFi signal extenders throughout my house.4) Camera gets extremely hot. While YI has installed a heat sink to dissipate some of this heat, I am concerned at safety, leaving this camera on while on vacation and catching fire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like a well-made product in general, but the six-second limit on clips triggered by motion detection were a surprise to me, and it is definitely not long enough.</p>
