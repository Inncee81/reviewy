<h5 id="caught-a-thief">Caught a thief</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked well and was not suspected by the maid that was stealing from my clients. An elderly couple.</p>

<h5 id="marvel-of-engineering">Marvel of Engineering</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is an important mistake in one of the videos that comes with the device (on the sd card). In the video with the title &lsquo;how to operate the pen&rsquo;. 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the video it shows how to start the video recorder. It shows the person pushing the button till the blue light comes on- they then release the button (after about a second). The light flashes 3 times to show that the device is now recording a video. This is the correct way to start recording a video. However as the person is doing this, they are speaking the words; “Press and hold the button. The blue and orange light will flash for 2 seconds. Keep hold of the button until the blue light flashes 3 times and the light is gone.The pen camera is now taking videos.” The words don’t match with what is shown in the picture and is 100% wrong and makes no sense whatsoever. If anyone tried to follow the verbal instructions in the video or in the printed instructions, they would never be able to make this device work.Another point to know is that after recording, pushing the button quickly will put the device into standby mode (yellow light) and a 2 second push will shut off the device.I would recommend purchasing one of these for anyone who has read my review and so who now knows how to start the video recorder. Fantastic picture and sound if you can figure out how to make it work.</p>

<h5 id="an-excellent-hd-covert-recorder-that-blends-into-nearly-any-environment">An excellent HD covert recorder, that blends into nearly any environment.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a professional investigator, I have used many types of covert video recorders, including pens. Every one that I have tried suffered from poor low-light abilities and image quality- except this one. The MiniCute HD Spy Pen is a great improvement over previous pen recorders that I have used. At 720p HD resolution, the video quality is noticeably better than most other &ldquo;spy&rdquo; pens on the market. Video is recorderd in true 1280X720, and the extra detail is apparent.The camera does well in low-light, and it has an easy to use one-button interface. It is no larger than a typical desk pen, and hides itself well in many everyday environments. I have used this pen in all lighting conditions, and was pleased with the results (I was even able to make clear recordings of a fireworks display, in near complete darkness.). Color rendition was also good, and sound quality was very good.The pen itself blends in easily to most everyday environments, and can is no larger than a standard desk pen. It can be used on a desk etc, as a stationary recorder; or held,carried, or worn on the person as a mobile recorder. Battery life is also much better than other pen cams that I&rsquo;ve used, and I have been able to capture over an hour of video per charge. The on/off/selection button atop of this pen has a well-defined but silent &ldquo;click&rdquo; when pressed, and is not loose or troublesome. This MiniCute pen camera also comes with a 16GB microSD card pre-installed and formatted, and 6 roller-ball ink refills (a BIG plus, if you actually use the pen).Overall, I am pleased with this camera&rsquo;s performance; and my only gripe, is that the activation button should be subdued, and not shiney- so as to conceal the fact that there is a switch at the top of the pen.Like you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others. If you liked my review, or felt that it was helpful to you, then please let me know by clicking “yes” below. I would also be happy to answer any questions that you may have about this product. Thanks!My reviews are real, and typically based on weeks of actual product usage. My opinions are not copied from other reviews, and are from my own personal experiences.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was pleasantly impressed with this product. Considering the space limitations and size constraints, this is a remarkable pen! The video quality is HD and very good. Of course you cannot compare the optics of this camera with the lens of a full size HD camcorder; that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair.I have a Mac and it was truly plug and play! The SD card comes installed inside the Card Reader, not the pen. So I first plugged in the card reader and instantly the SD card showed up on my desktop.Inside the card, there are 6 instructional videos that I highly recommend viewing to familiarize yourself with the pen&rsquo;s functions. I then removed the SD card from the Card Reader and inserted it inside the pen as shown in the videos and inserted the pen on my Mac for charging the internal battery.Don&rsquo;t know about Windows but if you have a Mac, you will never have to remove the SD card from the pen ever again (which is a hassle), you just insert the pen for charging when back from a shoot, and you&rsquo;ll be able to access the card at the same time.Then you can download your shots or clips from the Card to your Mac, and then delete the files on the card. Make sure you empty the trash before you eject the card, and you are done!The only Con so far is that it does not have a Motion Stabilizer, so you must keep the pen quite still while videoing or you will have shaky clips. Granted, I have only tested it handheld inside a supermarket. I assume that if you clip it on your shirt pocket for example, the video will be much more stable.Recommended for undetected shooting; will buy again!</p>

<p>I bought this item last week. I did not realize you had to format the Micro SD card. After you format the card takes beautiful pictures movies sound quality is good to excellent. So I bought a second one as a gift for my friend I give it five stars.</p>
