<h5 id="great-price-comfortable-and-functional">Great Price, Comfortable, and Functional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, you really can&rsquo;t go wrong. I bought this for a vacation to Florida where it would have been way to hot to use a wrap that we had been using.PROS:Price- If you want to make sure that your baby will like a soft structured carrier and aren&rsquo;t ready to invest in a nicer expensive one, this is the carrier for you. Or if you never want to spend a lot of money on a carrier, you will still get decent quality with this.Lightweight- the material is breathable and the carrier itself does not weigh much. I was able to wear for long periods of time in the hot Florida summer heat without overheating myself and baby.Versatile- The leg openings are adjustable for small babies and larger babies. All four straps that secure arms and legs are adjustable. Both straps that clip around parent are adjustable. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;5&rdquo; and my husband is 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; and we are both able to easily adjust this to fit comfortably.4 ways to wear- easy instructions and videos to help you wear baby safely. There is head support that folds down and snaps for when facing baby out. Both front positions and hip carry are easy to do by yourself, back carry needs assistance. ***We have not personally tried back carry yet as she is you small still. ***Washable- Very easy to machine wash without ruining.CONSDrool cover- Basically worthless. It&rsquo;s supposed to be able to attach both forward and inward facing, but the Velcro is only on one side of the cloth so it doesn&rsquo;t really work facing in. Plus it falls off easily anyways either way is attached. Not the biggest deal in the world, but it definitely is a useless feature.Shoulder straps- They are padded, which is nice, but it&rsquo;s not terribly thick or overly soft padding. It worked fine for our little baby, but I can&rsquo;t imagine using this for long periods of time once she hits 17-20#. The style of the strap is not the most ideal either. It&rsquo;s basically like backpack straps with a thin strap that buckles across your upper back. More expensive carriers will have x shaped straps or straps that actually cross over to help disperse weight better. But again, for the price it&rsquo;s nice to try out or use sparingly once the baby is heavier.Overall it was a good buy and I would recommend to anybody not wanting to spend a lot of money or trying out a soft structure carrier to test. We have since invested in a Beco Gemini, which is a very similar style, and also use a ring sling and Solly wrap for wearing at home, but we still use this carrier.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM</em></strong>My husband and I take this carrier on our nightly walks&hellip; 45 minutes to 1.5 hours and 1-2 miles each night. We love it so far.We are both completely different body types and it fits us both comfortably. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;5&rdquo; about 150 lbs. He is 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; and about 260 lbs. My husband still has a few inches of slack in the waist belt too.Our baby is big. 16.5 lbs at 2.5 months and he seems perfectly content and happy in the carrier. He sometimes even falls asleep. He prefers facing out even at this young age. That is one this that&rsquo;s great about the carrier, I can face him out without any extra newborn insert or having his legs spread too far apart. There&rsquo;s snaps to make the carrier width smaller in the groin area, so he&rsquo;s comfortable.The material is soft and the color is appealing. It&rsquo;s easy to put on without any assistance. And, it&rsquo;s very affordable.<strong><em>UPDATE 9/9/16</em></strong>*I was wearing the carrier for about 15 minutes <em>baby facing out</em> and luckily looked down and noticed my baby&rsquo;s legs were purple! He didn&rsquo;t seem to be in pain at all, but still&hellip; his circulation was being cut off. My baby has really thick thighs, so maybe that was the problem&hellip; just too big to fit properly? Or possibly, it&rsquo;s because his legs were just dangling straight down as opposed to being in a more &ldquo;sitting position&rdquo;. Needless to say, we&rsquo;re not using this carrier anymore. We&rsquo;ve just bought a Lillebaby, and we&rsquo;re going to try that one out.This carrier was good for awhile. Wish it could have lasted!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="yes">Yes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve only wore it once, i just got it today. I can say it is so comfortable. I will also say i was nervous my little one was not going to like it, but i was desperate to give it a try since she&rsquo;s so colicky and upsets her tummy when she&rsquo;s laying down. Also considering she settles down only when she&rsquo;s looking over my shoulder. To my first disbelief, she fell asleep with in seconds (yet felt like forever). My ears were ringing with happiness. She&rsquo;s content and happy, and I&rsquo;m not indented into the couch. If something happens as to my rating would change my mind, but my first impression highly doubts that&rsquo;s going to happen, then I&rsquo;ll cone back to say with what. So well worth the price, by having the good end of the deal.READ MORE</p>

<p>Does nobody realizes they children are hanging by their crotch !!!! I wish people would educate them selfs before buying this cheep crap !!! And the foward facing position is insane !!! Babies back can&rsquo;t naturally curve and they are like against board 😢READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-baby-carrier">Great baby carrier</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Baby is now six months since we’ve first bought this and still works fine. Little one is around 20lbs and 29” in height so I’ve carried him facing forward now. I’m 5’3” and weight around 138lbs. I’ve recently bought a hipster carrier but it didn’t even snap at the back. This though I can and the strap I’ve the shoulder is comfortable and adjustable enough that I can snap the lock between the shoulder blades.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed something to carry my daughter in that wont hurt my shoulders and back. I also didnt want to spend to much as she will grow out of it fast. I had a baby bjorn but she grew out of it. I ordered this and received it , to my amazement this thing is very simple to use. Supports my daughter and it wraps around hip to take some of the weight off the shoulders. Great product.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="don-t-use-mine">Don&rsquo;t use mine&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this to try out carrying and I didn&rsquo;t love it. I have since bought a Lille&rsquo;baby and LOVE it&hellip; it is more expensive but its worked better for us. I&rsquo;m giving this 3 stars because for the price its worth trying, I have seen several happy babies in these&hellip; so maybe it was my inexperience or my baby not being interested in being in a carrier!?READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="good-buy-at-a-great-price">Good buy at a great price</h5>

<p>I got this instead of a wrap. My baby did not like it at first. She is now two and a half months and loves being in it facing forward.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-large-infants">Great for large infants</h5>

<p>My daughter loves to be held, but by 6-8 months she had put grown the “regular size” carrier. This fits larger babies and has a wider band in diaper area for baby comfort.</p>

<p>I was initially doubtful of the quality because of the price, but nicely surprised when this arrived. Our daughter loves it, and so do I. A year later, it&rsquo;s still working well.</p>
