<h5 id="use-w-your-smart-phone-or-alexa">Use w/your smart phone or Alexa.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Once I finally figured out how to configure these plugs to my wifi modem and then in turn to Alexa Echo, I love them and will order two more plugs. Mine did not come with a manual, and when I contacted Hausbell, they emailed me a manual that was so tiny and unreadable (enlarging it just made it blurrier) that it was useless. If Hausbell would put out a decent manual, clear and complete, then these would be all the rage! The reason I ordered these in the first place, is that my husband installed an under-cabinet light fixture in the kitchen at a point above the range so high, that I had to stand on a step-stool to turn it off and on. Using a Smart Plug allows me to say, &ldquo;Alexa, turn on kitchen.&rdquo; I put the other plug to connect a lamp in the livingroom that is too high to reach from a sitting position. I just say, &ldquo;Alexa, turn on bird lamp.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="great-for-conserving-energy">great for conserving energy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i am crazy about lowering my electric bill when seen these i jumped at the chance to make sure i can control lights that the kids leave on in their rooms when I&rsquo;m not home this is super easy and fast to set up and operate plugin download app for your phone that app in formation can be found on the box follow the easy to read instructions step by step and if you really have a problem contact customer support but I don&rsquo;t think you will need that these are great to have to help conserve energy and lower your utility bill I am very pleased with my purchase and definitely recommend giving these a try</p>

<h5 id="fresh-breathe-before-i-even-have-to-get-out-of-bed">Fresh breathe before I even have to get out of bed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found my new best friend in this little Wi-Fi plug in. It has my morning coffee up and going before I even have my feet hit the floor. It is so nice to be able to plug it in set it for get it and walk away go to bed wake up to fresh hot brew coffee. And to shut off at a certain time after I&rsquo;m running around here like a chicken with my head cut off in the morning time getting ready for work and leaving and not turning it off. Excellent strong very hard plastic material quality Maine reliable and dependable product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-concept">Nice concept!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great concept! The interface is fairly user friendly and easy to use. Turning on/off lamps, stereo&rsquo;s coffee makers, electric ovens when you want is pretty awesome. I&rsquo;m planning on using this for cooking a good bit. Throw a potato in the oven or some beans in the slow cooker and turn it on when I want. Awesome!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dinner-waiting-and-hot-when-i-get-home-control-from-afar">Dinner waiting and hot when I get home? Control from afar!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For years now, I have wished I had a timer for my slow cooker. There are a ton of great-looking recipes that only cook for 4 or 5 hours. I work for far longer than that every day. Now? I have a timer for the plug, which means that I set it all when i leave, but I don&rsquo;t turn on the outlet until I&rsquo;m ready to get started. LOVE the smart plug! Such a cool idea and really makes use of technology! I can imagine so many different uses for this! And by the way - I had no problems getting it all set up :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="such-a-lifesaver">Such a lifesaver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am such a forgetful person. Not that I&rsquo;m absent-minded, but I have a million and one things to do being a mother. So, there have been times where I &ldquo;almost&rdquo; forgot to turn off things, and it left me anxious at time. Purchasing these smart plugs has helped me tremendously in being able to turn something off and on from the use of my phone if I forget to manually turn it off.Downloading the app and setting up was relatively easy. Very much pleased with this these plugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-cheap-to-feel-like-bill-gates">very cheap to feel like bill gates :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these outlets are so cool! it took all of 3 minutes at most to install (download the app, select your product, input your wifi password and you&rsquo;re set!). It really makes you feel top-notch being able to turn on appliances with your phone with a tap of your finger, the best part is that you can turn your stuff on/off from ANYWHERE. after the initial set up, you can be on any connection in any location with your phone and turn the switches on/off. highly recommend the pack of two at the minimum. I plugged in my desk lamp since I use it most often and my stand-fan that is quite a ways away from my bed so i dont have to get up (a bit lazy but it pays off when you&rsquo;re half asleep and dont want to get up to turn it on/off). and the coolest feature of the app is that you can set timers for the switches!! for instance i set my fan to turn off about an hour before i wake up so that i wont be freezing cold in the mornings</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="smart-and-easy-plugs-to-install-and-use">Smart and easy plugs to install and use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a couple of dark rooms in my house where there are no outlets attached to light switches or overhead lighting. These plugs are a great solution. I now control the lamps with an app on my phone. The installation was super easy: download the app, place the Smart Plug in the wall outlet, connect it to wifi using the app. I also like the fact that I can turn a light on quick and easy when I arrive home at night, I don&rsquo;t have to trip up the stairs to find a light switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great buy for the price, connected with my Alexa easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-wi-fi-plugs-work-just-as-good-as-the-wemo-plugs-for-less-money">These Wi-Fi plugs work just as good as the Wemo plugs for less money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Wi-Fi plugs work just as good as the Wemo plugs for less money. I use mine everyday and they haven&rsquo;t failed yet. They do use a different phone app than wemo FYI.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-happy-at">Not happy at</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>never stays connected, always showing offline in the app. Not happy at all</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-concept-poor-execution-still-needs-some-work">Great concept, poor execution&hellip;still needs some work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these on some flash sale, and even then, they&rsquo;re going back. They showed up and hooked up quickly&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-great-got-two-for-about-20">These are great! Got two for about 20</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great! Got two for about 20. Downloaded the Jinvoo Smart app - and literally had both smart plugs working within minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="frustrating">FRUSTRATING!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got these yesterday and was so excited cause so many say they are easy to connect. I was able to hook to the wifi easily but for the life of me I can&rsquo;t get them to connect&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="won-t-connect">Won&rsquo;t connect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not buy, both of them I bought have malfunctioned and died in the first 3 months of use. I want my money back!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="extremely-easy-to-use">Extremely easy to use</h5>
