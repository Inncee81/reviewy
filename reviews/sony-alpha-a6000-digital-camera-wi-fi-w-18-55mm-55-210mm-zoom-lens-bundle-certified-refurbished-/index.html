<h5 id="powerful-camera-for-a-ridiculously-good-price">Powerful camera for a ridiculously good price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is a powerful piece of equipment, well worth the price. It&rsquo;s got all the things you&rsquo;d look for in a pricier professional rig, but also features plenty of handy features for amateurs (some are gimmicky, but I can see how they would be appealing to some people).The autofocus on this camera really is amazing. This thing catches on fast, and follows almost perfectly. Shooting fast-moving targets is easy thanks to the quick autofocus and 11 frames per second. It can even track faces in crowds, so it knows to follow the face you want and not get distracted. I have had some issues with AF Lock switching mid shot, but it could be something I&rsquo;m doing because everything else about how this camera focuses on things is mind-blowing.The optical viewfinder is amazing! I can&rsquo;t figure out how we&rsquo;ve lived without optical viewfinders before. It allows you to see everything without having to move away from the eyepiece. See you aperture, shutter speed, etc. right in the viewfinder. This makes for quicker adjustments and you actually see what the final image will look like in the eyepiece.The camera is lightweight and compact and is easy to tuck away in hiking bags or laptop bags, making it the perfect travel/nature companion. Yet it&rsquo;s still durable. No cheap plastic here. Durable metal, which also looks stylish. Battery life is impacted a bit by the small body (smaller battery), but if you leave it in airplane mode except when you&rsquo;re actively using the smart features, that helps.The LCD tilts, but it doesn&rsquo;t rotate all around, so for me personally I would rather it not move at all.This refurbished model is fantastic, too. It looks and acts brand new. The seller is fast to respond to any questions, and even tosses in a free Sony camera case, 32GB SD Card and a few other goodies.PROS:-Insanely fast autofocus-Compact and lightweight-Powerful image sensor-PRICE!-Smart features like the ability to use your smartphone as a remote and upload directly to Flickr-Loaded with intelligent features, like a smile detector which helps you capture shots right as someone is smilingCONS:-Bluetooth would be nice. NFC is a bit clunky, and WiFi is sort of complex. Bluetooth would be a nice addition, but I&rsquo;ve honestly never seen a good-quality DSLR with bluetooth, so this is more of a wish list-Battery life isn&rsquo;t the best (but batteries are cheap)-Limited range of motion for LCD screen/Can&rsquo;t flip it around all the way</p>

<h5 id="wow-everything-i-needed-and-more">Wow, everything i needed and more!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived today so I can&rsquo;t really give you a long term review, but I will say packaging was excellent and mine also came with a 32 gigabyte sony SD card as well as a carrying case from Sony that fit all accessories included with this camera in the bag comfortably without having them damage each other. I think this has to be one of the best deals that I have came across on the Internet I&rsquo;m surprised many more people did not know about this deal because you really get a steal here. BTW I actually received the 16-50 kit lens not the 18-55</p>

<h5 id="great-value-and-great-camera">Great value and great camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve waited to post a review for a few weeks after buying because I wanted to put this camera through its paces first. But from the minute I received it, all I can say is WOW! This is just about the best bang for your buck you&rsquo;re going to get for this type of camera. I wanted something fairly small that would still get some great shots and this fits the bill. It has all the manual features that someone that&rsquo;s actually into photography will want, while still being able to get awesome shots when switching into full-auto mode for those that just want to point and click (my wife). Shortly after buying it we took a trip to Antelope Canyon in AZ and I think the results speak for themselves.</p>

<h5 id="fantadtic-camera">Fantadtic camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic camera! I&rsquo;ve owned several DSLR&rsquo;s and point and shoots over the years and this is by far the best camera I&rsquo;ve had. Light years above even the larger DSLR&rsquo;s; same features but in a smaller unit. The low-light sensitivity is great; almost no noise at high ISO&rsquo;s and bright, clear pics in very low light without using a flash. The burst shot is incredibly fast, with no loss of quality over the burst. 3 selectable burst rates is a great option (lo, mid, hi). On low you can still pull off a single shot without burst activating. Mid and hi are too fast for single shots. The video quality and stabilization are amazing. Even fully zoomed with the telephoto lens there is almost no camera shake when shooting freehand. Very smooth. The ability to wirelessly transmit photos and videos to your smartphone is fantastic. Works flawlessly. This allows you to offload from your SD card while in the field for more capacity, or backup your files to the cloud for safe keeping.Cons: The battery life has been really great so far, but it takes a long time to recharge. 4-5 hours to go from 0-100%. The menus are nothing special; just as difficult to navigate as any other camera. If any manufacturer could solve the navigation issues plaguing digital cameras, they&rsquo;d make a fortune. Finally, the small form factor does feel cramped for larger hands. The size reduction outweighs this negative for me, but if you must have the room a DSLR provides, you might have trouble adjusting to the narrow controls.Overall a great camera, and lots of camera for the price. Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="great-kit-but-camera-has-poor-battery-life">Great kit but camera has poor battery life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit is being sold at a great price. Everything came looking brand new, it had all the accessories, and the camera and lenses worked great. It came in a Sony camera bag. The camera takes very good photos. I was thrilled to get the A6000 at this price. However, my issue is not with the seller or the fact it is refurbished. I love refurbished electronics for the savings. My issue is with the camera&rsquo;s battery life &ndash; it is really below average. Other photographers on the web have commented on the same thing. It starts draining the minute you turn it on. I tried turning of the Wi-fi, but it didn&rsquo;t help. I considered keeping this kit and buying some extra batteries, but the idea bugged me. I bought this as a light weight alternative to my dslr - if I am carrying around two extra batteries it sort of defeats the purpose. The SD card is also hard to remove. Almost Sony&hellip;</p>
