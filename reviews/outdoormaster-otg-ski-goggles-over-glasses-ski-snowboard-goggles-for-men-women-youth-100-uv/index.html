<h5 id="amazing-goggles-for-the-price-highly-recommend">AMAZING goggles for the price&hellip;highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These goggles were great for a big ski/snowboard trip with my family! It had been 6 years since I had gone snowboarding, and so for this trip both my husband and I needed to purchase ALL new gear. Obviously this is a very expensive endeavor, and so we were looking to save anywhere we could, while still keeping quality. When it came to snow goggles, all we could find were ridiculously cheap ones that wouldn&rsquo;t work, or really expensive ones that just wouldn&rsquo;t fit our budget. After lots of searching I figured I would roll the dice with these, and they were everything I wanted them to be and more! While they were pretty large on my face, everything else shined way above that. They basically never fogged up except in BLIZZARD conditions at the top of the mountain, the tint was PERFECT for a sunny and cloudy day, and they were SO comfortable to wear on my face and slid up to rest on my head when not in use on the bus ride home. They stayed put and were easily adjustable. The goggles look just like the picture, and they actually looked and worked way better than their $20 price tag. I would HIGHLY recommend these for anyone looking for new goggles. Even if you had a big budget, my husband says that when he tried them out, they even worked and fit just as good, if not better, than his $40 Smith goggles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-solid">Pretty solid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have only used these once so far, however I am quite pleased with how well they worked. I think that I would have preferred something a little darker, but my vision was good, and they are quite comfortable!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="felt-comfortable-to-wear-and-never-fell-off-after-multiple-falls">felt comfortable to wear and never fell off after multiple falls &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these googles for a first attempt at skiing. I didn&rsquo;t want to invest into anything too expensive. These goggles were priced well and had decent reviews, so I decided to give them a shot. They were delivered promptly with zero damage, felt comfortable to wear and never fell off after multiple falls as a beginner skier, and I had zero issues with fogging up. My significant other ended up borrowing them for a couple runs down the slope and enjoyed them just as much as I did. I definitely recommend these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-deal-works-great-costs-very-little">Awesome deal. Works great costs very little</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price these are amazing. My wifes used them on ourt recent ski trip and she was raving the entire week about how well they work and what a great deal they were.Out of the box they do a good job of enhancing the sun light, fit over glasses and they are comfortable when used over the helmet</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-re-great-if-you-don-t-wear-a-lid">They&rsquo;re great if you don&rsquo;t wear a &ldquo;lid&rdquo;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These goggles don&rsquo;t have a long enough strap to fit comfortably with a helmet - they&rsquo;re TIGHT. Also, the buckle in the middle of the strap doesn&rsquo;t fit in the goggle strap retention device on most helmets. And they leave a bit of &ldquo;gaper gap&rdquo;. Great goggles if you don&rsquo;t wear a &ldquo;lid&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-if-you-wear-glasses">Great if you wear glasses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do wear glasses and I purchased these goggles specially for those wintery snow blizzards days in the Northeast when I&rsquo;m shoveling the driveway/walkways. They are very comfortable while wearing my glasses however I should&rsquo;ve purchased the goggles with a lighter tint for those cloudy days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-product">Solid product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall a good product for a great price. Little disappointed that the lens isn&rsquo;t truly &lsquo;mirrored&rsquo; but can&rsquo;t complain about the overall quality</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="affordable-but-may-not-fit-over-most-glasses">Affordable but may not fit over most glasses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably in the category of you get what you pay for. These are very &ldquo;affordable&rdquo;, but I take issue with the specific description of &lsquo;over the glasses&rsquo;, which is only true if you have a smallish face and therefore smallish glasses. I have a leftover pair of &ldquo;John Lennon&rdquo; glasses with tiny lenses that fit these, otherwise I&rsquo;m S.O.L.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ski-goggles-fit-well">Ski goggles fit well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were an early Christmas gift for an early ski trip in December and they loved the goggles. Hope they do well on the slopes under all conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-style-but-not-much-suitable-for-my-nose">pretty style. But not much suitable for my nose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality is ok, pretty style. But not much suitable for my nose. Overall is good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these, fit comfortably. Can&rsquo;t wait to use them this winter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-goggles-for-the-price">Excellent goggles for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the way it covers my big face. They might be too big for anyone who has a small face. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;0&rdquo; 225lbs. Hope this helps</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for sunny days!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-worked-great">They worked Great..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Grandson uses then with his dirt bike. They worked Great&hellip;Go value!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="arrived-scratched">Arrived scratched</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived with a scratch right out of the box ðŸ˜©</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these goggles seem like they&rsquo;re going to be fine for sky season &ndash;fit OK</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-and-sturdy">CUTE AND STURDY!ðŸ–¤</h5>
