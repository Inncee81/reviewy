<h5 id="this-camera-is-amazing-for-its-size">This camera is amazing for its size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing camera. I&rsquo;m a professional photographer and I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. I also love all the manual controls and the ease-of-use. I shoot weddings on a Canon 5D Mark III and a Canon 6D. In a pinch I could easily use this camera if I needed to.The picture I have attached is a 15 second exposure with my kids running around with solar lights. This shot is un-edited and was shot in raw. The only thing I did with the picture was transfer it via Wi-Fi to my cell phone using the Canon picture app.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="nearly-a-perfect-camera-nearly-a-complete-dslr-replacement">Nearly A Perfect Camera. Nearly a Complete DSLR Replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a hobby shooter, but prefer quality and do a lot of YouTube videos. For background, I&rsquo;ve had a variety of different camcorders, point-and-shoots, and DSLRs: Sony RX100 III, Nikon D5300, D3200, Canon Vixia lower end series, Go Pro Silver 4, three-axis gimbals, etc etc. After having tried out all of these cameras over the last 4-5 years, the Canon G7X Mark II is the closest thing I&rsquo;ve seen to the total package. It&rsquo;s lightweight and ultra-portable &ndash; small enough to fit in your jeans pocket &ndash; but packs a tremendous punch, and is loaded with features.The f1.8 aperture is very sharp at 24MM, though I find that the camera likes to default to f/2, and when shooting manual I need to make a slight adjustment if I want the 1.8. Autofocus is fantastic; virtually seamless in most settings. In low light it takes a second. I also found when trying to manually focus two objects about 2 feet apart on a table (a cup and a candle) that it struggled to focus on the foreground item (hunting) until I corrected by hand.As far as the image quality goes on this guy, it&rsquo;s tremendous, and if you spend some time learning how to use it, it will replicate a Nikon 5xxx or Canon t series very well, without the bother of a bunch of different lenses. Night shooting is great, and it&rsquo;s very easy to do timelapses and get quality images of the night sky.The 24-100mm (35mm equivalent) zoom range is fantastic, and you really don&rsquo;t notice the camera stopping down from 1.8 to 2.8 across the zoom. The digital zoom (beyond the 4.2 optical) is also fairly usable for at least the first little bit, though at full digital zoom it is very grainy.Noise comes in around 1600 ISO, but you can adjust some other settings to deal with that; really you&rsquo;re probably good for most everything until around 2000 ISO.Other Pros:- Fantastic touch screen that&rsquo;s very responsive. I haven&rsquo;t owned many past cameras that use a touch screen for so many settings, but this guy is able to deal with most everything right on the screen.- The swivel screen is nice, and I&rsquo;ve found myself using the downward tilt for high shots more than I expected.- Very simple wifi connection to your phone or computer makes getting shots on instagram (or wherever) a breeze.- Though others have complained about hearing the autofocus sound during video recording, I have not heard it yet. Unless you&rsquo;re in dead silence and need the sound off the camera, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d ever be a problem.- An incredible amount of presets for multiple shooting situations make it so the novice will not need to fiddle with manual settings much (if ever).- The low light performance on this camera is absurdly good. I&rsquo;m frankly not sure how they do it. I was sitting in a chair in my living room in what was nearly pitch black, and the camera was able to light the shot to the point that it looked like the room was fully lit. No noise. It&rsquo;s bizarre (and awesome!) how good this thing shoots in low light.- The weight. So much power in a package you can bring with you just about anywhere.- Unlike the first edition, with the Mark II you can shoot in the &ldquo;film quality&rdquo; 24p, which I tend to enjoy.Other Cons:- The bokeh is good on this camera for the most part, getting very high quality bokeh/background blur if your foreground and background images are 6 or more feet apart. If you&rsquo;re trying to distinguish between two items closer together, it still works well until about 2 feet apart, but the bokeh is not as creamy or DSLR quality. Within 2 feet, it&rsquo;s hit-or-miss.- The battery is simply not capable of supporting what this camera can do. They probably needed a battery twice its size, so buy at least one extra battery.- I might be doing something wrong, but have so far only been able to set the lens ring to adjust aperture or shutter speed. It will not adjust zoom or manual focus as I thought I&rsquo;d be able to do.- The touchscreen manual focus is nice, but trying to adjust it without touch focusing is very cumbersome.- No 4K, but I don&rsquo;t find that to be a huge negative honestly.&mdash;Overall, this thing is a beast, and with just a few more tweaks could probably become a full DSLR replacement for just about everyone except full-time professional photographers. If you&rsquo;re doing anything up to and including serious, routine videography, this thing has horsepower and built-in capabilities to do the job. I&rsquo;ll be selling my NIkon D5300 and accompanying lenses and using this as a full-time shooter for a while. I&rsquo;ve yet to find any deal-breaking limitation.Finally, I bought this off Amazon, because it seems to be backordered everywhere. If you have an eBay account, I got mine from &ldquo;Red Tag Camera&rdquo;, who shipped and delivered to me in two days. They still had six in stock as of Tuesday, so you might want to check there if you want one soon.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="impressive-follow-up-to-the-g7x">Impressive follow-up to the G7X</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The G7X Mark II, though not without flaws, is an excellent enthusiast compact. There have been some notable improvements over its predecessor.IMAGE QUALITY: Overall, very impressed with the exception of the Automatic White Balance. It seems to create a blue cast which is exacerbated by the flatter and less constrasty picture profiles. If you can live with manually setting the white balance, this camera creates excellent, sharp, colorful photos. Default JPEG noise reduction is a bit heavy-handed as well, but if you just set it to low you&rsquo;ll get much better results. You&rsquo;ll especially get excellent results from this camera is you utilize the in-camera raw processing tool, which is great. ISO performance is about the same as its predecessor. Even though the lens is the same as before, it seems as if Canon quietly made some improvements to it overall as its more consistently sharp throughout its range. It doesn&rsquo;t quite rise to the level of the lens on the RX100 series cameras but it&rsquo;s still plenty sharp and plus with the G7X Mark II you get the extra 30mm on the telephoto end, which is useful.PERFORMANCE: Autofocus performance has improved over its predecessor although it isn&rsquo;t what I would call lightning fast. Even though the camera touts improved burst performance, especially in RAW, this is not a camera I would rely on for action shooting. Shot to shot times are good and the camera starts up fast. One thing that has to be mentioned is the significant improvement in battery life. While it doesn&rsquo;t even come close to most DSLR, that fact that Canon could take the same small battery and give it noticeably better battery life is commendable.BODY/ERGONOMICS/BUTTONS/CONTROLS: Overall I like most of the changes to the camera&rsquo;s overall design. The more pronounced grip up front is nice. I like that the LCD is more flexible than before which makes composing shots easier in bright, sunny conditions. I also like that you can switch the lens ring in the front to silent, that is a nice touch. The only thing I find irritating is that the ridged part on top of the LCD tends to collect dust and other particles very easily. And speaking of that, this lens, like other 1&rdquo; compacts, is very susceptible to getting dust/particles inside the lens. High recommend that you buy and extra lens cap in order to limit that from happening. I wish Canon would consider sealing the lens a little better on future models to counteract this issue.MENUS/WI-FI: The camera has a more EOS style menu system but overall the layout is pretty typical Canon. One thing that I like is the expanded picture style menu to include the new Fine Detail mode borrowed from the 80D. That does make a difference in JPEGs. As mentioned before, the in camera raw processing tool is great. You have all the parameters to adjust that you need and full access to the picture style menu. WIFI connectivity is very easy. The Canon camera connect app picked up the camera right away and transfer was quick.MOVIE MODE: Excellent video quality. Autofocus is not bad but did hunt just a little during a test video I shot with it.The $679.99 may seem like a pretty steep price to pay, you are getting a lot of camera for your money here. As long as you&rsquo;re ok with a maximum lens reach of 100mm, this makes a great alternative for a hobbyist who is considering a Canon Rebel but does not want the size/bulk and really won&rsquo;t venture much beyond the kit lens. It has a few flaws but overall, it&rsquo;s a great camera.READ MORE</p>
