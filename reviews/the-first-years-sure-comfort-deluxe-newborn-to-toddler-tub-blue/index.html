Product Description
The Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn to Toddler Tub with Sling is a mommy favorite! In fact, it was voted BEST bathtub in BabyCenter&rsquo;s Moms’ Picks 2014 awards. The tub’s deep ergonomic design holds baby better for bathing, with a mesh sling and padded headrest to provide extra comfort and support to cradle newborns. The form-fitting netting provides security, making bath time less stressful for both parents and baby. Once baby grows, they can sit up comfortably and have room to play on the toddler side. No wonder moms love it so much!</p>

Plus, the mildew-resistant pads make for a cleaner bath and a special drain plug changes color to alert parents if the water is too hot for baby. From newborn to toddler, bathtime couldn&rsquo;t be better! This deluxe version includes green mesh sling.</p>

<h5 id="a-bathtub-that-served-me-well-since-newborn-to-10months">A BATHTUB THAT SERVED ME WELL SINCE NEWBORN TO 10MONTHS&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is so crazy but believe me when i say it, i have been using this tub ever since my LO was a newborn (she is now almost 10M). the main reason why we purchased this tub was 1) it had a lot of great reviews and 2) because our house ONLY has a working stand up shower.and i can honestly see why this is best moms pick and have so many great reviews bc i love and depend on this so much during bath time!!i will seperate this by months of baby!NEWBORN:i love the sling in the bath. it&rsquo;s easily removable and easy to clean. after every bath i would just wring out the leftover water and hang to dry. no mold from the foam at all! there&rsquo;s also like a tiny bucket/container inside the bathtub which gives me easy access to her soap or wet cloth.3-4MONTHSI hate to admit but i was still using the sling at this time. i had a constant struggle where my daughter would slip sideways on the tub without the sling (only bc she wasn&rsquo;t able to sit up on her own yet). even though she was obviously way too big for it, just for safety, i still used the sling. her legs would be dangling out of the bathtub and her arms would flare out everywhere but it was still good! baby never rolled out of it and never came across a issue of sling breaking/tearing. or the baby being uncomfortable.5-7MONTHSso around this time, we finally took out the sling. also around this time, my daughter started to splash, tried to roll over and kept trying to eat the water. but a few toys in there helps a lot to keep her in control. there&rsquo;s also a more slouched position and a more upright (at the other side of the tab). at first i didn&rsquo;t notice it and just thought the different dents in the tub was so that it could fit on top of a sink. but nope!!! the design of this tub was so well thought of that they included a more upright position for your baby to bathe in when she&rsquo;s older. so awesome bc my daughter started to not like the more slouched position around 7-8months (only bc she&rsquo;s a very active baby and wanted to be more mobile during bath time).8-10MONTHSmy LO is a very and i mean a VERY active baby. i have caught her numerous times to climb out of the bathtub!! it happens to often that i constantly grabbing her and repositioning her back inside the tub. also, she is a long baby so her legs get cramped a lot in the bath. even though i would love to keep using his bath, i sadly have to let it go around this time&hellip;overall, this bathtub is amazing and it&rsquo;s truly a bathtub to keep throughout the first year of your LO (unless your LO is as active as mine haha).i&rsquo;m sure if my baby wasn&rsquo;t so free spirited or active, i would use this all the way till she was 1. but for now, i have to look into a bigger tub. i can&rsquo;t believe how much i got out of this tub in he last 10M&hellip;(and with only spending less than $20!!!!)i will definitely recommend this tub to all my newly pregnant friends and will probably purchase again for the next baby!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-tub-plus-easy-storage-hack">Great Tub! Plus Easy Storage Hack&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great tub! It&rsquo;s kind of large but I was able to find a simple way to rig this set up in my bathroom so I could easily hang it on the tiles. I used a command waterproof 20pd hook and a nylon rope keychain. Drill a small hole in the side of the tub and put the key ring through it. As you can see in the photo now it&rsquo;s out-of-the-way! Excited to get this a real spin in a few short weeks when our little one arrives.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-tub-i-have-3-kids-and-am">Love this tub - I have 3 kids and am &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this tub - I have 3 kids and am on my 3rd one. (Four years between each kid, so I had gotten rid of it both times). Truly is newborn to toddler. It&rsquo;s a little bit cumbersome for a small bathroom but not as bad as others I&rsquo;ve seen, and it&rsquo;s inexpensive. Perfect to get you through bathing baby from their first sponge bath until they can sit up in the bathtub.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a nice purchase for baby bathtime. My granddaughter got a lot of use out of this and I liked how well it hooked over the kitchen sink making it high enough so that I did not have to bend over a bathtub or kneel on my bad knees. Also, worked well in the bathtub until my grandson was able to sit in a bathtub without it.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Works, I ditched the mesh pretty early on but still a good product. Sits on double kitchen sink securely thanks to the bases design. Also has drain/plug to make the draining easy. The tube has foam padding that helps hold baby up and acts as a cushion as well.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-tub">Very Happy With This Tub</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is very well-designed. My baby absolutely loves taking baths in it. He is two months old and we have been using it since he was a few weeks. I like to keep the plug on the bottom open so that the tub drains and I can keep pouring warm water over him without the tub getting too full.The sling seems comfortable and is easy to take on and off if it needs to be rinsed.The only downside is storage. It would sure be nice if there was a way to fold this up, it&rsquo;s quite bulky.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-bathtub-for-the-price">Great bathtub for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first bathtub we bought did not work for our 6 lb baby at all. The sling in this tub made it so easy to wash her and she looks crazy comfortable resting on it. We have since moved to her sitting in the big part of the tub and she loves that too (at almost 4 months and 11lbs.) The tub fit into our kitchen sink which is a single bowl. The bottom drain is convenient to reach to drain water as needed during the bath and after you are done.The only issue we ran into was after about 2.5 months the sling started developing mildew and we weren&rsquo;t able to get it off. I think many people would have moved away from using the sling at that point so it probably would not be an issue, we just had a smaller than average baby who needed it for a little longer. After every bath I would wring out the sling and hang it to dry but it didn&rsquo;t prevent the mildew from starting to form.Overall we love this bathtub and it is perfect for the price. Just watch for mildew developing on the sling part.READ MORE</p>
