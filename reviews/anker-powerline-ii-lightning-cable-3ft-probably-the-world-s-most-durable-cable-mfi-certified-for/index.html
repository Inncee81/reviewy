<h5 id="the-powerline-ii-lightening-cable-is-thicker-and-seemingly-more-sturdy-than-the-other-anker-cable-but-i-have-had">The PowerLine II lightening cable is thicker and seemingly more sturdy than the other Anker cable (but I have had &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a second charging cord to add to an earlier version of the Anker lightening cable. The PowerLine II lightening cable is thicker and seemingly more sturdy than the other Anker cable (but I have had no problems with the first charging cable). Also the connectors have a larger protective shield for the two USB port connectors. The two improvements should extend the useful life of the newer power cord.The PowerLine II Dura Lightening Cable, attached to an Anker 2-port 24W USB wall charger, charges my iPhone at 6% every ten minutes. At that rate a completely discharged iPhone battery should recharge in less than 3 hours.With a lifetime replacement warranty and responsive service department you can not go wrong purchasing this cable.</p>

<h5 id="a-lightning-cable-that-lasts-even-when-stressed">A lightning cable that lasts even when stressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a winner. I use lightning cables in the field where a phone is connected to a battery in my back pocket by the lightning cable. The phone is in and out of my front pocket each time needed. Other high-quality cables only held up to such stress for six or eight weeks. After that, the phone lost power for a moment here and there&mdash; just enough to close running apps and cause other weird behaviour from the phone. The cable was disconnecting more and more as the cable grew older.I finally tried these Anker cables. Month after month they hold up to my daily abuse. Although they are a little more costly, they will be around much longer than the ones I had to discard.If you are looking for a cable that&rsquo;s going to hang in there a long time, this is the one I believe will do it for you!</p>

<h5 id="best-cables-you-can-buy">Best cables you can buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased many different brands of iPhone cables. Always opting for the cheapest I can find. Apple&rsquo;s cables are too expensive and break too quickly. So I would buy brands like RavPower, Mpow, and other super affordable brands. They would save me lots of money but they would break just as fast, if not faster than the Apple cables. These are a perfect medium. You pay less than Apple&rsquo;s cables, and these cables will last you forever. I swear I once you hold one of these cables you&rsquo;ll know instantly there&rsquo;s no way these are going to crap out on you. I will from now on only purchase my lightning cables from Anker. I already purchased more for my mom and my sisters. Seriously you will not regret buying these!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="finally-a-lifetime-warranty">Finally, a lifetime warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Anker cables are my favorite full spec cables, and while I understand why they would avoid reversible plugs, it always bothered me that they didn&rsquo;t offer lifetime warranties on such sturdy cables. My previous lightning cable did eventually get a hole right in the middle, but it&rsquo;s been so long that I can&rsquo;t find any record of the purchase to even try and get it replaced under warranty. The serial number has worn off the cable, and I couldn&rsquo;t find the right box in my pile of Anker boxes.It was my favorite cable, however, and when I saw that they had released a version even stronger, it was the clear choice. It&rsquo;s barely heavier or thicker, but feels tougher somehow. Although that could be because I had obviously worn enough of my old cable off to see the wires inside.I&rsquo;m considering getting another one, although I&rsquo;ve recently been more drawn to reversible cables, and even micro USB cables with lightning adapters. If I catch Anker making one of those, I&rsquo;m jumping on it immediately</p>

<h5 id="great-cable-there-is-a-difference">Great cable: There is a difference!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have more lightening cables than I can count from many vendors. None work as well or feel as high quality as this one. Anker has always provided very high quality products and this is one of the best. I use one in my car with an Apple Play radio and the last cable I used was very slow to connect, while this one is immediate. I was surprised at the difference. In the house I have an iPad that would not charge with another brand name cable, but I plugged it into one of these and into the same wall plug and no problem charging.You get what you pay for and this product is no exception.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-star-for-an-anomaly">3-star for an Anomaly?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave this thing a 3-star because I&rsquo;m skeptical. Right out of the box comes a charger which feels pretty robust. Comes with a Cord Organizer (a velcro strap), a little card that say &ldquo;Happy? Not Happy?&rdquo; with some info on the inside, and of course the charger. As soon as I put away the box and what not, I go to put the the charger in and charge my phone. Once I plugged it in I put it down. Then in the corner of my eye I noticed my phone light up saying it was charging as if I just charged it. After fiddling with the connector I found out that if I put some downward pressure on the piece of plastic that goes into the phone that it won&rsquo;t charge. But it seems that if I take my finger off it goes back to charging. Just something weird I found right out of the box, I literally sat next to my window watching for the package and as soon as I saw the mailman I closed my phone after a Blitz Match of VainGlory and walked out with my cup of tea. Went back in got mu charger and opened it. Then found out the anomaly.I hope this charger lasts long, but do they really? Who knows.I&rsquo;ll be back after a couple of months to edit this review, maybe (hopefully)</p>

<h5 id="the-last-cable-you-may-ever-need-to-buy">The last cable you may ever need to buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone who owns an iPhone or an iPad knows that Apple&rsquo;s cables barely make it a year with regular use. Their cables weaken at the connection points. I have owned this case for about a week and am confident that this very well be the last cable that I need to purchase. You can feel the quality of this cable the minute you open the packaging and I absolutely love the color! Should a warranty claim ever need to be made, these cables are backed with a lifetime warranty. You can&rsquo;t beat that!Anker makes quality products and when the time comes to replacing my battery pack, it will be an Anker!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-high-quality-product">Very high quality product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recommend Anker Lightening cables over the stock Apple Lightening cables that come with your iOS device! These cables are far more durable and are pretty much the exact same length and plug size as the genuine Apple Lightening cables. These are only half the price and the warranty is unmatched! Buy these cables instead of the genuine Apple ones. I promise you that you won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>
