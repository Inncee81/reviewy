<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-s-not-the-highest-rated-tv-in-its-class-but-i-chose-it-anyway-here-is-my-reasoning">It&rsquo;s not the highest-rated TV in its class, but I chose it anyway. Here is my reasoning</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After doing tons of research on different TVs on the market, I settled on the 65” LG UH7700, despite the fact that other TVs in the same price range have better ratings. So I’m here to share how I came to my conclusion. Before purchasing this TV, I heavily considered 3 other TVs including: Vizio P65/M65, Samsung KS8000, and the LG OLED B6P.BUILD QUALITY:This LG UH7700 has superior build quality compared to the Samsung QLED line up. Don’t believe me? Simply go to the store and touch the screen. The Samsung TVs flex easily with the slightest touch and emit that bright spot that tells you that you shouldn’t be touching it like that. Now touch the LG panel and it feels solid, thick and substantial. This will not affect how your content is displayed, but it’s comforting to know the TV wasn’t slapped together with the cheapest materials and construction methods. Plus, it just <em>feels</em> better.PICTURE:Now when it comes to getting a good picture, this TV looks terrible out-of-the-box. In my opinion, every TV does. To calibrate this TV, the first thing you want to do is turn OFF every picture enhancement feature available. That includes: Energy Savings, Dynamic Contrast, Dynamic Color, Preferred Color, Super Resolution, Noise Reduction, MPEG Noise Reduction, Motion Eye Care, LED Local Dimming, and TruMotion. If there is an option that cannot be turned off, set it to “low”.Why turn off all these options? Because there is no such thing as an image enhancement without some side effects. For example, Dynamic Contrast/Color will make your sky look more blue, but diminishes the details of the clouds. Noise Reduction will remove some noise at the cost of a muddier picture. TruMotion makes the frame-rate buttery smooth – just like a Soap Opera! Once all these settings are off, it’s time to dial in your colors.On my particular unit (and yours may very), I found these settings to be most effective in maintaining a balanced picture:Brightness 50Sharpness 40Color 50Tint R15Color Temp. W14Other than that, the only Picture enhancement I turned on was Super Resolution. I set that to “low”. Nearly every issue mentioned in the negative reviews are addressed when using these settings as a starting point.Now if you’re anything like me, you’re probably wondering about Brightness and Contrast since this TV has less of it compared to the Samsung KS8000 and the LG OLED TVs. First off, let me share a little background about myself. I am a professional photographer who works on a professional 10-bit color accurate monitor that costs 300% more than this TV. One thing I need to stress is that “Contrast” is not the end-all measurement for picture quality. You can have the brightest whites and darkest blacks but none of that matters if the pieces in the middle suffer. The OLED TVs go deeper into the blacks, but also “crush” shadow detail. So there are details in the shadows that should be seen, but are not because they turn completely black. On the other hand, the Samsung QLED TVs are capable of going MUCH brighter than the LGs. This looks nice in a big bright store like Best Buy, but I prefer not to have my eyes assaulted when I’m watching a movie at night. So consider your viewing conditions when comparing brightness specifications. I also find the Samsung TVs (and phones) to be over-saturated by their default settings. If you are wary about the contrast ratio of this panel, think about the last time you were in a movie theater and ask yourself if the blacks were not black enough or the highlights not bright enough. If the picture in the movie theaters was acceptable to you, this TV will not let you down.VIEWING ANGLE:The LG uses an IPS panel which is the reason it has a lower contrast ratio than the competing Samsung (VA Panel). The upside LG&rsquo;s IPS panel is a wider viewing angle. This feature was a big influence on my decision to go with the LG UH7700 since my livingroom consist of an L-shaped couch.HDR SUPPORT:LG supports HDR10 and DOLBY VISION. Content creators who master their films in Dolby Vision are held to a much higher standard than those who master for HDR10. Fortunately, Netflix and Amazon offer both, but will prefer Dolby Vision when it is available.STYLE:This is one of the big reasons I picked the LG over the Vizio M65. This panel is slightly narrower thanks to thinner bezels. So it fit perfectly in place with no room to spare. The back of the unit is also slim and clean. The Vizio is clunkier which is a trade off due to full-array LED backlighting. Vizio offers a great Tv but lacks style. Beauty is subjective, but you really shouldn&rsquo;t buy an ugly TV just like you wouldnt buy an ugly couch.SMART TV:I never intend to use the SMART features, but I went ahead and set it up anyway. I was actually shocked at how fast and fluid the Operating System is. The User Interface is fluid, responsive and easy to navigate.AUDIO:Like all other flat panel TVs, the built-in speakers are a joke. At the bare minimum, get a sound bar or a home-theater-in-a-box solution. But a picture this nice deserves a true surround sound solution to complete the experience.THE UGLY:Due to edge lighting (the technology that allows the TV to be so slim) there is some unevenness in the backlighting. This is most apparant on pure white screens. None of my 5 housemates notice it on this panel. They also did not notice it on my previous TV which was much much worse in every circumstance. Chances are, you won’t see a different unless you have an eye for it.The TV remote has a pointer thing that works much like a Nintendo Wii controller. I don’t think it adds any value to the experience and I personally prefer to use the “arrow” buttons to navigate.The stand feels a little bit wobbly when you are trying to move things around. It also does not swivel.in a nutshell, this TV offers:- a competitively priced TV- exceed build quailty and materials of competitors- does not serve you advertisements (Unlike Samsung!)- wider viewing angle than comparable TVs- Slick and responsive Smart TV operating system- HDR10 and Dolby Vision compatibility- Beautiful hardware design</p>

<h5 id="outstanding-picture-and-sound-without-the-outrageous-price-tag">OUTSTANDING PICTURE AND SOUND without the outrageous price tag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading some of the other reviews with a number of issues from lack of brightness to light bleed and dead pixels, I almost feel guilty that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed mine for nearly 2 months with flawless performance. My only guess is that the early production runs spit out a few lemons, but that&rsquo;s what the 1yr warranty is for during the &ldquo;break in&rdquo; period. Some people would rather write off a model because of a bad unit than have it taken care of and enjoy what really is a GREAT TV.Moving on, I will kick things off by saying that I HIGHLY recommend this model as an excellent choice for picture/sound/features at a price that makes it almost seem like a value model when compared to some of the &ldquo;high end&rdquo; (marginally superior) sets from Samsung/Sony. For those who need 3D, you&rsquo;ll want the 8500 series. Besides 3D, the only other difference between this and the 8500 series is greater audio output (20W vs. 40W) on the 8500 model. However, don&rsquo;t let the numbers trick you into believing the sound on the 7700 is &ldquo;weak&rdquo; in any way by comparison. Even in a large room, having the volume at around 30% is plenty. The sound, designed by Harmon Kardon, is VASTLY superior to most others out there, thanks to twin downfiring speakers that have decent bass response and remarkable clarity. Is it impressive enough to compete with a home theater speaker system? Of course not, but for casual viewing it&rsquo;s a massive upgrade over the built-in sound of several comparable models.TIP: Ask salesman to connect demo model to in-store WiFi and play a music video on YouTube; better audio test than their stock 4K feed.In regards to the picture quality, it does require some tweaking to achieve the kind of jaw-dropping &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; effect that has people jumping to 4K so early in the game. However, there&rsquo;s no shortage of options to help you find just the right setting for your habits. The &ldquo;smart&rdquo; setting will match the viewing options to the content type. Example: sports will use the &ldquo;Sports&rdquo; preset which will turn on Tru-Motion (aka &ldquo;soap opera effect&rdquo;) to account for the fast-moving action. The presets do a fair job, but many people have their own viewing preferences that the custom options will help you with. Disney/Pixar Blu-Ray discs come with calibration software that you can use to help fine-tune the image with the TV settings. Keep in mind that while this model gets great praise for it&rsquo;s upscaling from 1080p to 4K, it will not match the quality of native 4K content. Luckily, while we all wait for providers to get to work on building a library, YouTube has a lot of 4K videos to enjoy, and Netflix/Amazon video are the leaders so far. DirecTV has 3 dedicated 4K channels, one that shows sports, one that is a 4K version of their PPV Cinema channel, and the other is typical 4K &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; style footage. The inclusion of Dolby Vision puts this model in a league of its own as not all 4K TVs with HDR have that so this model is future proof as more content becomes available.Last but not least is the overall look and styling of this model, which I enjoy. The silver frame is so thin that it almost disappears (especially in a dark room). The TV stand is a simple &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; design but looks very high end. I think the style of this TV really shines when wall-mounted because it&rsquo;s so thin (except where the bottom flares out to accommodate the speakers). The &ldquo;Magic Remote&rdquo; is an incredible device, with a microphone for voice command and search, and a &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; pointer to make navigation much easier than the typical &ldquo;arrow keys&rdquo;. There is an extensive LG Content store with an impressive collection of the most sought-after apps, and there is quite a lot of storage space available to load your unit up (depending on what kind of apps you choose). If you already have a smart WiFi Blu-ray player, you may be less inclined to load up the TV with apps, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that I tend to prefer having everything I want locally on the TV.Overall, I really think LG did a great job on this model. I&rsquo;ve seen impressive models by Samsung and Sony, but honestly the premium price on those provides negligible difference, especially when it comes to the most important aspect: picture quality. I strongly suggest that anyone shopping for a 4K TV check this one out in-store, hopefully viewing more than the stock video source, and judge all others comparably priced against this model. Happy Hunting!<strong>UPDATE</strong>I&rsquo;ve had this for ~6 months now and I&rsquo;ve still paid attention to what&rsquo;s out there and besides the OLED 4K models or SUPER high end Sony models, I don&rsquo;t think this model can be beat in the &ldquo;bang for buck&rdquo; category. I watch a lot of 4K videos on YouTube and I&rsquo;ve downloaded a variety of 4K and HDR videos from [&hellip;] and stream them from my PC and they&rsquo;re STUNNING! It&rsquo;s a real shame that some people have had some bad luck but the odds that you&rsquo;d have the same bad luck twice are very slim so if you get a bad one, exchange it for another unit immediately and enjoy what really is an excellent 4K TV!</p>
