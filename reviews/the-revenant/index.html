<h5 id="movie-great-amazon-video-downstream-not-so-great">Movie Great/Amazon Video downstream &ldquo;Not so Great&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The movie was great, however the streaming from Amazon was lacking, I kept getting low downstream can&rsquo;t watch error. Well, after 45 minutes of contacting my cable company, testing my internet speed (Which tested at 55.3 download speed) I direct connected my tv and still got the error, I finally gave up and ordered it on demand from my cable company. Amazon was amazing and refunded my $$ for the movie purchase since I was unable to view it via Amazon. I think that Amazon with as great as they are at EVERYTHING &ldquo;I am a VERY Satisfied customer&rdquo; better look at their video platform and not have this ruin their reputation. :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beautiful-in-all-ways">Beautiful in all ways</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has become one of my very favorite movies and I have watched it four times. &ldquo;The Revenant&rdquo; disserved every Oscar it won and probably more. The story is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, who is 1823, went on an expedition into uncharted territory with a group of fur trappers and was actually mauled by a bear, but apparently not to the extent that DiCaprio was in the movie. The difference was that the real Glass was not left behind to die alone in the snow and cold of a northern winter.The movie is a wonder of excellent acting, cinematography, sound, directing, and DiCaprio tells his story without saying a whole lot throughout the movie. It is a story of revenge and survival that is told so well by the wrting, co-production and direction of Alejandro G. Inarritu. The first inkling for making the movie first surfaced with Inarritu in 2001, so it took a long time to finally get it made. This film is a work of art that plays out in snow-filled, icy and uninhabited beautiful but sometimes deadly land, with Indian raids happening and the poignant story of a lost Indian daughter.Tom Hardy did an excellent job of acting, also. His accent in the movie made me laugh every time I heard it at first. This is a movie that shouldn&rsquo;t be missed.</p>

<h5 id="leonardo-great-as-always">Leonardo Great as Always!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EXCELLENT!! Leonardo was superb in his character and Tom Hardy was also very believable in character. Although the movie was dark it was suspenseful and well made! Would suggest to friends or anyone who is a DeCaprio fan. Revenge is in the hands of the Creator.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="though-a-very-good-movie-it-was-quite-long">Though a very good movie, it was quite long</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Though a very good movie, it was quite long, but intriguing and beautfifully photographed. Leonardo Dicaprio&rsquo;s performance was up to his standards and should be a must-see movie for all who love a good adventure. The ending was predictable with the villain, played by Tom Hardy, killed off by the Indians</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-movie-a-work-of-art-meant-to-be-seen-several-times-each-time-seeing-more-details">GREAT MOVIE - A WORK OF ART MEANT TO BE SEEN SEVERAL TIMES - EACH TIME SEEING MORE DETAILS ! ! !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a movie !!! It is an absolute work of art. The people who say it is dark, moody and depressing should not be watching it at all. It does an excellent job of portraying life in the wilderness in the 1800&rsquo;s of men who trapped furs for a living and lived a very raw life just to survive. I honestly do not know how Leonardo DiCaprio ever managed to live through this movie while it was being made - I was frozen the whole time and felt like I was right there with him &amp; the other trappers and Indians. Life back then was horrible and for the men that chose trapping in the wild during the time that Indians stalked everywhere; they really had a rough life. Eating raw fish &amp; meat and even rotten food was just the way they had to take it sometimes, to survive. The Cinematographer Lubezki and the Director Alejandro certainly deserved awards for their skills and talents. I am going to look up the movie &ldquo;Man in the Wilderness&rdquo; with Richard Harris just to compare how the story was portrayed differently. This is an incredible movie, which certainly entertained me, even if it was hard to believe that the main character could survive so many unbelievable threats to his life!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>certainly NOT what i was expecting. i am not about to give away the plot of this movie however i do think Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job in this movie. guess i should have read about this before i ordered it&hellip;&hellip;. i could have waited until it came out on Cable to watch it&hellip;. some, however may completely enjoy this movie however i was under the impression the plot was headed in a different direction. (JMO)</p>

<h5 id="well-done-historical-savagery">Well done historical savagery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw this in the theater with my husband. He loved it and went back to see it a second time. I liked it and felt that there were times that the movie was awfully slow, but it was well done. If you like historical savagery without a lot of dialogue, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this. My husband is into history so this was right up his alley.The cinematography was spectacular, and the acting was convincing. I like it when I can forget things about the actor and just enjoy the character, and that happened for me in this movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-why-we-watch-movies">This is why we watch movies!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A terrific movie; it is exciting, dramatic and involving. This is a gritty world of swift and deadly consequences and you may well get the shivers empathizing with the characters as they struggle through their frozen world. Fine acting, solid story and a great feel for a time long passed. Don&rsquo;t miss it. The picture quality of this disk is spectacular, subtle in color but huge on detail and contrast.</p>
