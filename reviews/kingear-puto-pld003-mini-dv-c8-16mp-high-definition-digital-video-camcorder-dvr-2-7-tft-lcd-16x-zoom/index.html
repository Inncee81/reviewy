<h5 id="puto-pld003-camcorder-the-breakdown-of-comparative-expectations-performance">Puto PLD003 Camcorder - The Breakdown of Comparative Expectations &amp; Performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> There are currently three different camcorders, all at very different price points, on the same product page. The one I am treating here is the cheapest of the lot, the Puto PLD003 (currently listed under $70).My video focuses on the physical features and operation of the PLD003.It is important to keep the pricing and thus realistic expectations in mind - I have had my share of cheap camcorders, and am fully aware of the appropriate comparative framework in which to judge the performance of this camcorder (it certainly is far, far better than a $80 one I purchased nearly a year ago). However, it is also about your own expectations, desired uses, and, once again, practicality.In a practical sense, this is quite good for a &ldquo;first time&rdquo; traditional style camcorder, casual recording or as a pre-teen&rsquo;s choice. For presentational recording of any sort, even if just for YouTube or other social media&hellip; not so much. Naturally, I likely have become more jaded over time as I have moved up in terms of equipment, yet I have also evaluated plenty of Action Cams and Dash Cams within the same exact pricing range, and I will be blunt - many action cams within the same general $60-$70 range have better video capture performance.So let&rsquo;s get the poor stuff out of the way, and it all does center of the video capture:The anti-shake does help a bit with stabilization, yet it also works against it, causing warbly video capture around the edges, even while standing still. Fast panning causes movement tracers. To be fair, many similarly priced Action Cams have the same fault, so this aspect can be realistically expected in the pricing range.Compensates poorly when the sun loops into view, causing extreme shadowing around the glare, and shadows in general are near black. Similarly priced Action Cams usually do far better in these areas.It&rsquo;s best focal point seems to be at around 30 feet&hellip; not much farther and not closer in. In fact, in the manner I personally use camcorders - up close product examinations - it&rsquo;s quite blurry even with manual lighting adjustments. This was the most disappointing aspect, and though it is shared with a few Action Cams (Hewlett Packard&rsquo;s own foray early this year is one that stands out in my memory), I have evaluated too many action cams in the same range that keep the crispness.Zooming loses even more detail clarity. However, Action Cams in this range don&rsquo;t even offer zoom, even the WiFi enabled ones.In many ways, the video characteristics seems to be on par with Dash Cams in the $40 to $60 dollar range. Yet as mentioned, you can certainly do far worse when it comes to the budget range, and this has many comparative pluses to alternative action cam choices.a) Lightweight for a traditional build - 10.14 ounces with the NP-120 battery insideb) As for the battery, the NP-120 is a popular, easy to find battery, used in Fuji cameras and others. So getting extra batteries is a breeze, totally unlike action cams in this price range where finding the exactly correct battery can be a massive gamble (seriously).c) Front LED cool white lighting. Short range, perhaps no more than a foot, but it is an additional feature that is not commonly seen in the first place.d) Easy operation. I never even opened up the manual. Of course, first time users may want to, yet all its default settings are set to 720p @ 30fps, automatic white balance and scene, anti-shake on, and so on. Mine had a near full factory charge, so all you really need to do is plop in a SD card (I am using a 32GIG Class 10 Sony SD card) and go.e) USB 2.0 interface with Windows 10 - no problem. It didn&rsquo;t like being read through a USB hub, only through a direct USB port in the PC itself, yet this is not an uncommon finicky characteristic amongst any style of video recorder. Simple directory setup (unlike my Sony AS20 with its crazy amount of folders and sub-folders).f) <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; screw mount, the universal sizing for tripods and traditional mounts. This may very well be the main consideration between going with something like this or a similarly priced Action Cam. It was for me in the beginning - and still is now, even today.The vast majority of all action cams tend to have a completely different mounting system (usually a GoPro style flange), as well as usually not allowing any kind of mounting without the typical waterproof casing on. Being forced to have the casing on adds all manner of other hassles, only one being for those (like myself) who constantly needs to upload video clips. In fact, I probably can write an entire paper about why I am entirely in favor of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; screw mounting over GoPro flanges and direct mounting of video recorder over being forced to use some sort of casing.g) Good placement for the Picture an Record buttons - you may (or may not) be surprised how some designs put those buttons in awkward places when gripping the camcorder from the right. Zoom button is also very easily accessible, which may or may not be a good thing ((lol)).h) When you look at the actual audio specifications at the bottom of my review, the very poor numbers would indicate that sound capture is atrocious (especially compared to Action Cams with absolutely superior audio numbers)&hellip; however, the sound clarity is fine. Just a touch muffled with very slight edge distortion to vocal narration, yet understandable enough. And it is the results that matter most to me, not the numbers.i) I personally don&rsquo;t care for MOV (QuickTime) file formats for recording - and that is what pretty much all Action Cams use. This uses the traditional camcorder format - AVI. Although I prefer MP4 formats overall as a web poster, I will always personally take AVI native recording formats over MOV.SUMMARYSo in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t quite stack up in terms of video clarity and detail when similarly priced action cams can provide, yet it does do well enough in its own right for a easy-to-use traditional setup for beginners, kids, and something to fool around with that doesn&rsquo;t involve an expensive smartphone. In fact, let&rsquo;s briefly bring Android tablets with integrated cameras/video recording into the picture - any tablet under a $100 is going to look terrible compared to what this can achieve as they usually are going to have 2MP as their best&hellip; and even poorer video capture performance.Now for the numbers breakdown of one video clip from the PLD003:1 minute 14 second clip in AVI file format1280x720 @ 30fpsTotal Bitrate: 1363kbpsAudio: 1 channel (Mono) at a laughable 16kHz (Bitrate 256kbps) - but I want to stress again, when I did my various tests, I didn&rsquo;t look at these numbers&hellip; so when I finally saw them, my eyebrows shot up. I suppose in hindsight, it makes sense, yet don&rsquo;t let it dissuade you overly.187MB total file size @ 1:14 - so 10 minutes will be around 1.5GIG in size (this is to help you decide what the minimum storage capacity of an SD card you will want).- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</p>

<h5 id="great-video-camera-for-the-price">Great Video Camera for the Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While this camera is lower in price than others do not discount it. I have been using it for a while now and have been impressed with the quality of the images that I received through the video and the photos too. The audio could be better and I I wish there was a way to connect an external microphone, but that being said the audio was ok for the projects I was working on, and it worked for the price.The video camera does have a mount for a tripod which was nice and being as lightweight as it was it also worked on a gorillapod too. the video camera takes a SD card which is not included, but it does allow you to expand this quite well.The camera has 16mp and anti-shake as well as 1290X720 HD quality.All in all I am impressed with this camera thus far and for the price, you get a lot!purchased one of these a couple of months ago, not expecting much due to the low price. However, although lightweight and not terribly robust, given reasonable care it should last well . The video and pictures that it takes are pretty good, particularly the video, although the sound is not hi-fi quality, ( although adequate). The menus and options are extensive and easy to use. Battery usage is not bad<em>I received this for review - all opinions are my own</em></p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-good-place-to-start">This is a good place to start</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product was sent to me for review and to save any unnecessary confusion, it&rsquo;s available in 3 different models; the PLD001, PLD002 and PLD003. I reviewed the PLD003.It comes in a decent box and inside the box, other than the PowerLead Puto PLD003, 16MP HD 1280 x 720 camcorder, you get the Li-ion NP-120 battery (already inside), USB charger, USB cable, TV cable, user manual and case. You also get a 12 months warranty with the 30 day option of swapping it for a different &lsquo;PowerLead&rsquo; model if you are not happy with itFrom a quality perspective, it&rsquo;s well made, lightweight and small sized. The design on this is modern, appealing and the shiny black coloured plastic adds further to the appeal. The arrangement of buttons are suitably placed in general with the only exception here being the record button, which is positioned at the back. Ideally it should have been positioned at the front, for ease of use.The LCD screen is 2.7 inches and although that might sound too small, it isn&rsquo;t. You also get the tripod attachment at the bottom which you get standard with camcorders these days despite it having the image stabilisation. What you don&rsquo;t get is the option to attach an external MIC to it. Yes, there are detailed instructions included but honestly it&rsquo;s so easy to use you probably won&rsquo;t need them.Set up could not have been any easier and one important point to note here is that when you insert an SD/SDHC card up to 32GB inside, it will wipe all your saved photos / videos (I leant the hard way!). Its best to use a brand new one. If you haven&rsquo;t owned a camcorder before, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the SD/SDHC card is not the same as the SD cards that you use with smartphones and tablets, it&rsquo;s a lot bigger.In use, I found this to work quite well with a few areas identified for improvement. First, the likes; the image quality is good in daylight for the price point, all the buttons / controls are responsive, the hand strap is very comfortable and it felt really good in my hand, really nice size and ideal for children. I really liked the style on this and the 270 Deg LCD rotation lets you twist the screen so you can view what you are recording in a number of different angles (e.g in front of it and behind it). The auto power off was also relied on a fair bit and is essential for battery saving.The not so good; it struggled to capture acceptable footage in less optimal conditions in both auto and night mode and the end result was dark and pixilated images, even in my well lit kitchen. Why?. The MIC could have picked up audio better too and whilst the auto stabilisation was not that impressive, the zoom worked quite well but the loss of quality was more than I expected.Upon review of the above information, I would say that this is ideal for someone who wants an inexpensive camcorder with good daylight filming abilities that&rsquo;s very easy to use that&rsquo;s not too fussy about audio clearness and isn&rsquo;t planning to do any nighttime filming. Although the footage would not quite be good enough for YouTube, DailyMotion and Vimeo uploading for example, it&rsquo;s certainly a good place to start.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-ok">It&rsquo;s ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera to take with me to my son&rsquo;s Marine graduation. It&rsquo;s reasonably priced, compact, user friendly and nice looking. The downside is the sound quality is poor, the quality of the videos are grainy and the battery life is not great. I did not want to spend much on a camera and I paid for what I received. It worked it&rsquo;s purpose. It&rsquo;s good if you want to record moments that you do not mind to watch in ok quality. For a graduation ceremony I wished I would have invested in a better quality camera. It&rsquo;s a good camera, not great!</p>
