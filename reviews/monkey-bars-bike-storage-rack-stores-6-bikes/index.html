<p>Size:6 Bike Storage
The Bike Storage Rack by Monkey Bars securely stores 6 bikes in a compact space. The Bike Rack&rsquo;s ability to store 6 bikes is designed for long term storage, freeing up valuable floor space in your garage. For daily use, it is recommended to store up to 4 bikes, making it easier to get the bikes on and off the rack. The rack is constructed of industrial steel with a gray powder coat finish built to endure years of heavy use. The hooks snap and slide along the bar allowing you to choose where to place the bikes along the rack. The hooks also contain a plastic coating to prevent scratches on your bikes. The rack is 48&rdquo; wide allowing you to drill the brackets into the wall studs. This rack is strong enough to hold up to 200 lbs. Get your bikes up off the floor today, giving you more room for your cars.</p>

<h5 id="ok-needs-a-bit-more-for-the-cost">OK - Needs a bit more for the cost</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Goods:1) Could hold 6 bikes if you alternate bike orientations (handle bars up, down, up).2) Powder coating is of good quality.3) Steel brackets and bar are solid.Bads:1) Screws provided are not long enough and could rip out. They are only 2&rdquo;. They should be 3&rdquo;.2) Hooks slide around when trying to place a bike. Annoying.3) Hook pops into place on bar with a small <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; lip. This lets you take off the hooks easily, but I have no need to. I knocked one off trying to get the hook through my tire. Worries me a bit. They should have made the hook base a square/diamond hole, to slide completely around the bar. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t have potential to pop out and fall down.Tips:1) Buy your own Lag Bolts, 3&rdquo;.2) Don&rsquo;t mount too close to a side wall, because the handlebars of an end bike may not allow it. Allow for that space, about ~&ldquo;12 needed.3) Consider mounting the bar away from the back wall, by shimming small 2x4s behind each mounting bracket. Would help get hooks around the tires more easily.4) Don&rsquo;t mount bar too high as the other guy said. 8ft max, or you&rsquo;ll be lifting using weaker muscle groups and potential injury. Or, as the dad, you&rsquo;ll become the DEDICATED bike valet. Crap&hellip;5) Use zip ties or drill holes/bolts into bar as a method of keeping the hooks from sliding around.6) Use zip ties to keep the hook lips from &ldquo;popping&rdquo; out of place and falling down. Extra security.This is a good product and it does it&rsquo;s job. Get longer lag bolts. After it was all said and done, I actually kind of wish I just made my own out of wood. I could have probably used 2x4 for the bar, and just bought large bike/rake/ladder type of hooks to screw into it. Would have saved a lot of money and been pretty strong. If you&rsquo;re handy, consider that since this product is no more complex than that.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-organization">Great for organization!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works great for our bikes. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to get the bikes up and down. I was so tired of having the bikes cluttering the garage. This works great to get the bikes up off the floor and keep them organized. We had something different in the past that held each bike individually and you used the rope to lower it. It worked fine, but having older kids who have bikes, we have too many to use something like that anymore. This works great for multiple bikes and it doesn&rsquo;t keep them so close together that you can&rsquo;t easily get one of the middle ones down. I definitely recommend it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-awesome-we-have-a-3-car-garage-and-3-cars">This thing is AWESOME! We have a 3-car garage and 3 cars &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is AWESOME! We have a 3-car garage and 3 cars which means there is absolutely NO room for anything else on the ground in the winter when all 3 cars are garaged. This rack is a God-send! I will admit, it is very difficult to get the bikes on and off of it. Not difficult, but awkward, but that could be because we have it so high up. But once they are up there, they are up there and out of the way and that is PRICELESS in the winter when we store them and aren&rsquo;t using them. Can&rsquo;t believe we didn&rsquo;t get one sooner. Worth every penny!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dangerous-design-flaw">Dangerous design flaw</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured from a dislodged hook mounting bracket. Yes, the brackets and bar appear strong. As someone else mentioned, 3&rdquo; screws would be better than the included 2&rdquo; screws. The problem is the brackets which mount the hooks to the crossbar. Each time I lifted a bike up in the air to be suspended from the hook, if the tire bumped the hook sideways, the bracket would pop loose from the bar (especially fat-tired bikes). Turning the hook to face the opposite direction made little difference. Used heavy zip ties around the brackets to help guard against dislodging and warned kids to never rack/unrack/bump. If only the manufacturer had used four sided brackets to mount the hooks, the product would have been foolproof from a safety standpoint. IMO, with these three sided hook mounting brackets which routinely pop off the crossbar, it may be only a matter of time before someone winds up crushed by a falling bike.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fatal-flaw-in-the-bike-hook-system">Fatal flaw in the bike hook system.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems like a handy system but the bike rack has a fatal flaw. The bike hooks that mount on the crossbar pop off easily every time you remove a bike. They should have been designed to fully slide onto the crossbar so this could not happen. Tried hanging the bike hooks both directions that are possible (vertical and 90 degrees from wall) with no better luck. Sent it back for a refund and ended up using those 99 cent wall hooks that actually worked better than this system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-nice-rack">Pretty nice rack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty nice rack. I&rsquo;ve got 4 bikes hanging on it right now, and haven&rsquo;t had any real issues. It is mildly annoying when the hooks slide from side to side while trying to put a bike on or take one off, but it&rsquo;s not a deal breaker. It installed in a few minutes and has a nice finish which looks like it will hold up well over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-like-it">We like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are very pleases with this bike rack. We have place at the back of our garage and it really saves space. Two notes to other buyers: we habe two hybrids and two beach bikes hung and barely have room for a kids bike, so we cant see how one could fit 6 full size bikes. Second, as others have notes, you have to screw the hooks into the rack at fixed locations or they do move when you try to remove bikes. Those two issues are the only reason for the 4 star rating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-i-really-like-it-the-rack-was-very-easy-to-install">and I really like it. The rack was very easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I set this rack up in my shed, and I really like it. The rack was very easy to install, requiring only 4 screws. It ended up taking very little effort to install something that provides the ability to store 6 bikes. The number of bikes you can store on the rack will depend on the size of the bikes. I only have 4 bikes hung on it currently. It&rsquo;s probably possible to hang 6 adult bikes, but it may require 1 or 2 of the bikes to be hung back wheel up. However, the ability to slide the hooks gives a lot of flexibility in accommodating different sized bikes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-rack-tight-fit-for-four-bikes">Nice rack. Tight fit for four bikes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install. I installed it in a cinder block wall with my own anchors. I too echo others&rsquo; worries about the hooks staying on the bar. Four bikes is a bit tight.</p>

<h5 id="great-rack-definitely-a-space-saver">Great rack! Definitely a space saver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great rack! Definitely a space saver. I&rsquo;d buy it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best">Best!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This storage rack is an absolute lifesaver when it comes to garage organization! It was very easy to install (2 brackets, that&rsquo;s it!), took us about 5 minutes to get it done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrible-for-mountain-bikes">Terrible for mountain bikes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The seller should warn you that this rack is not designed to store mountain bikes. The hooks are too small for mtb tires and itâ€™s a huge pain to use for all of our mountain bikes&hellip;</p>
