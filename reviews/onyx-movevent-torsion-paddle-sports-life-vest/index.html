<h5 id="i-love-this-vest-along-with-hard-to-find-sizing-info-great-for-whitewater-too">I LOVE this vest (along with hard to find sizing info!) Great for whitewater too!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have been paddling with a cheap, &ldquo;universal&rdquo; life vest you owe it to yourself to try one made just for kayaking, and the Onyx Movevent Torision is the best one you can get in it&rsquo;s price range in my opinion. I have been kayaking on lakes, rivers, and on whitewater since 1988 and it is the most comfortable one I have ever owned. It is so comfortable, after 10 minutes you won&rsquo;t even remember you are still wearing it. It stays up high on your torso and out of the way. It is the first paddle vest I&rsquo;ve ever owned that doesn&rsquo;t often wind up crammed in a storage compartment while on quiet water. It is worth every penny of it&rsquo;s price, if for no other reason, simply because I actually wear it every time I go out. I love the two zippered pockets, the air vents on the chest, and the knife/whistle/accessory mount. The chest vents make this vest the coolest one I have ever owned, which is great in warm weather when I do most of my paddling. It has the quality look and feel of a much more expensive paddle vest. It floats me good too. And the HUGE arm holes mean absolutely no chafing of the skin from rubbing against the vest while paddling. After owning mine for a short while, I bought 3 more - one for every kayaking member of my family. I wanted to know they would actually be wearing a PFD and not just storing one on the boat to be legal.And since no website seems to bother with this, here is the sizing chart that came with mine. This is supposed to work whether you are male or female, though large breasted ladies should probably compensate somehow and I trust they will know how to do this without instruction from me. The vest is fully adjustable for a good fit across the sizes given:X-Small/Small = 28 - 36 inch chestMedium/Large = 36 - 44 inch chestX-Large/2X-Large = 44 - 56 inch chestMeasure under your arms around the largest part of your chest and go with it. If you are within an inch or two of being between sizes, it has been my experience that it is better to go with the smaller vest rather than have the adjustment strap ends hanging to your knees.Good luck!UPDATE: BTW&hellip; I&rsquo;ve seen some CRAZY prices on this line of vests recently. I guess some retailers see a great review or two and try to cash in.Just so you all know, they come in 3 models with different names and are distinguishable by color and certain features. Manufacturer&rsquo;s Suggested Retail Price (I.E. the highest price we should ever pay for anything IMO) on the red ones is $69.99. These are called the &ldquo;Torsion&rdquo; or &ldquo;Torision&rdquo; model and have 2 zippered pockets, an accessory mount, and come with a whistle. It is top of the line. Several big, reputable, well known retailers are selling these for $59.99 or less with free shipping. The gray ones are called the &ldquo;Dynamic&rdquo; model. These have only one zippered pocket, a whistle, and mount. MSRP on it is $59.99. The yellow ones go by the name &ldquo;Curve&rdquo;. They have no frills what-so-ever and retail for only $49.99. These prices are straight from the Onyx website as of Fall 2014 and in my opinion you shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay more. As a matter of fact, you can probably shop around and find them for less. Either vest in the line up wears and floats the same, so you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to buy the most expensive one just to do the job of a life saving device.Prices are all over the board across the entire model line, so I just thought everyone deserved to know this.UPDATE - And BTW&hellip; This is a fine, perfectly acceptable vest for use in whitewater. I use this vest primarily in whitewater, as would most any experienced whitewater paddlers I know. It is obvious that another reviewer is not a whitewater paddler and has misinterpreted a U.S. Coast Guard recommendation.</p>

<h5 id="comfortable-for-kayaking">Comfortable for Kayaking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this over the winter in preparation for this year&rsquo;s kayaking season. Used the new vest on the first paddle of the season and found it to be very comfortable. I&rsquo;m a 40-something year old woman and I do flat water lake paddling. Nothing too strenuous, but we&rsquo;re out there for several hours at a time and I wanted something comfortable. This fits the bill. I pretty much forgot I had it on, which means that I&rsquo;ll leave it on, which is great.</p>

<h5 id="class-lll-pfd-may-not-be-suitable-for-your-skill-level-in-white-water-use">Class lll PFD may not be suitable for your skill level in white water use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have stated, this is a very comfortable life jacket. But be advised, this is a class lll PFD which per coast guard requirements is only suited for calm, inland water ways where rescue is quickly available. This PFD may not be suitable for your experience level while white water kayaking or rafting. The PFD rating of this device should have been included in the product description. Only after receiving the product and reading the accompanying booklet (required by the coast guard) did I realize its rating. Quoting the coast guard manual: &ldquo;Wearer may have to tilt head back to avoid going face-down. Will not hold the face of an unconscious wearer clear of the water. In rough water, a wearer&rsquo;s face may often be covered by waves. Not for extended survival in rough water.&rdquo; Also note that this vest has no head flap to protect your head if you end up going down river backwards or hold your head above water should you get knocked out. Please read comments to this review and decide for yourself if this vest is right for you.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-very-comfortable-pockets-fit-my-iphone5s-perfect-and">works great. very comfortable pockets fit my iphone5s perfect and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great. very comfortable pockets fit my iphone5s perfect and I like the whistle it comes with. the square clip on the front is great for attaching small pocket knives. very well priced considering its competitors for this type of jacket.</p>

<h5 id="good-choice-for-the-money">Good choice for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with this PFD. I had to trade it in for the XS/S size because I didn&rsquo;t factor in that these are men&rsquo;s vests. Fits as well or better than the ladies PFD&rsquo;s that I tried. Cinches down at my waist and still allows room at the top. Arms move freely without chafing against the jacket. As others have said, you forget that you are wearing it. Plenty of mesh in back (and in front) allow it to breath. Back padding stays above my high seat-back for comfort. Used it the first time on a full-day paddling trip and was grateful for the ventilation. Pockets do not have as much gusseting as other brands, but they are adequate for iPhone if you want, and ID, sunscreen stick, key, etc.&ndash; but I prefer to stow my phone, camera, etc. in a dry bag at my feet or in the deck bag. Yes comes with attached whistle.</p>

<h5 id="mine-is-to-loose-for-white-water-use">Mine is to loose for white water use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this PDF initially for recreational kayaking. It is lite, comfortable and cool. I have worn it shirtless with no problems. I am 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, 240 pounds with a 45&rdquo; chest. My understanding of proper sizing is that the PDF should not be pulled up when grabbed by the shoulder straps. Last weekend, I attended a white water kayaking school. The instructor checked all our PDFs and felt mine was to loose when fully tightened. Over the course of the class I ended up swimming in some fairly rough waves and I agree with the instructor. This PDF was to loose to keep my head above the water. Had I not been trying to keep my paddle and kayak with me I would have pulled the vest down but my hands were busy. I have ordered a new PDF which has more adjustment straps to keep the vest from riding up. I like this PDF but make sure it fits you well.</p>

<p>Fits well. Easy to adjust. Comfortable to wear for a day on the water.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very comfortable, but sizes run a bit larger than stated</p>

<h5 id="so-comfortable-that-i-forgot-i-was-wearing-it">So comfortable that I forgot I was wearing it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this for kayaking a couple of times and it&rsquo;s incredibly comfortable to wear while paddling and doesn&rsquo;t get too hot in warm weather.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kayaking-or-sport-use-only">Kayaking or sport use only!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So this is a great kayaking life vest, it&rsquo;s definitely not meant as a floatation device for long. You need to know how to swim.</p>

<p>The quality is excellent but this seems very bulky. This is probably a terrific jacket for whitewater rafting but I ordered it thinking it would work for taking an inflatable&hellip;</p>
