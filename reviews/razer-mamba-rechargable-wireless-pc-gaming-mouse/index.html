Free to Frag
The Razer Mamba wireless mouse returns with an ultra-precise 4G Dual Sensor System. The new iteration makes use of both a laser and an optical sensor to enhance tracking precision by calibrating to different surfaces and allowing adjustment to lift-off tracking.</p>

<p>With up to 15 percent improved battery life for more untethered gaming enjoyment, multi-colored lighting for personalization, and an industry-leading wireless technology, the Razer Mamba is still in a league of its own.</p>

<p>Press Reviews
&ldquo;Very precise and configurable gaming mouse&rdquo; – Game Star</p>

<p>“…it definitely delivers on its promises—it&rsquo;s lightning fast, accurate, flexible, and comfortable—generally as good or superior to its corded gaming mouse siblings in virtually every way.” – Examiner</p>

<p>“When used for gaming, I&rsquo;ve found the Mamba far more customizable, elegant and comfortable than my previous choices to date.&rdquo; – Destructoid</p>

<p>Dual gaming-grade wired/wireless technology
Are you ready to take your gaming further than before, cord-free? As Razer is the pioneer of the world’s first gaming-grade wireless tech, you can be assured the Razer Mamba performs as well cordless as it does corded. With a 1ms response rate, your command is executed first even if you and your opponent react at exactly the same time.When the battery depletes in the Razer Mamba, just plug in the USB cable so you can keep gaming while it recharges, for zero downtime. Or when not in use, pop the Razer Mamba on the charging dock that doubles up as the unit’s wireless receiver.</p>

<p>view larger
An incredibly comfortable gaming experience in-hand
Razer Mamba’s curves are subtle and seductive to look at, but it really needs to be held in hand to feel how exquisitely comfortable it is for your fingers. The gentle slope fits snugly under palm while the buttons are all optimally positioned for easy actuation. The Razer Mamba’s right-handed ergonomics lets you game for hours on end without strain and fatigue.</p>

<p>4G dual sensor system
Experience the new pro-gaming standard of precision with the 6400dpi 4G dual sensory system, outfitted with a laser and an optical sensor to accurately calibrate the mouse to any surface for exceptional tracking. The Razer Mamba not only matches the speed of your swipes – no matter your play style – but also lets you track and adjust the cut-off to lift-off distance, empowering you with more control than ever.</p>

<p>view larger
Hyperesponse buttons
From Razer’s very first gaming mouse to now, our mice buttons are designed to be hair-trigger sensitive. This means as soon as you think it, your finger has already mouse clicked it. Utilizing highly durable micro-switches, there is a pronounced tactile feedback to your fingertips with each actuation, so you get the absolute assurance that you’re winning with precision.</p>

<p>view larger
Multi-color lighting
Bright pink, deep purple, or Razer green – with over 16 million colors to choose from, make the Razer Mamba shine bright in just the way you want it to.</p>

<p>view larger
Razer Synapse enabled
Enhance your Razer Mamba experience with Synapse, Razer’s hardware configurator with online cloud support. From sensitivity to lift-off tracking to surface calibration, you’ll be able to customize every detail. Better still, this data is saved in the cloud, so you can play your way wherever you are. Razer Synapse keeps your Mamba in peak performance via automatic driver and firmware updates so you’ll be on top of your game, all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>warning the battery on some off the older Razers are defective and can explode or do what mine did blow up like a balloon and it got stuck in the mouse, I had to use a butter knife to get it out. Razer is awar of the problem. Other then the battery problem this is a great gaming mouse I have not had any problems with it except for the battery. works great both as a wireless and wired mouse. it fits comfortably in my handI do recommend this mouse great buy just keep an eye on the battery.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="poor-battery-life-and-more">Poor Battery life, and more&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did not have this mouse long as it suffers from poor battery design. I am not sure if it was just my battery or not but I couldn&rsquo;t even squeeze an eight hour day out if it. This was also with light/causal (no gaming) use.Charging also seem to be an issue. If charged from the base it would take upwards to 20 hours for a full charge. I made it a point to keep the mouse on the base overnight (while sleeping). Never did I wake and have a full charge, so it was like fighting losing up hill battle from the start.The scroll wheel was loose. It came with a fair amount of play from left to right. In addition, if pushed to the right it would trigger the middle mouse click.The Razer software was ok, however, upon initial installation of the mouse and software I run into issues resulting in having to re-install the software several times in order to get the device and application to function correctly.I can recommend a Razer DeathAdder, but I can not recommend the Mamba.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="easily-the-worst-mouse-i-ve-ever-used-in-my-life">Easily the worst mouse I&rsquo;ve ever used in my life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:It&rsquo;s has pretty lightsComfortable in the handNice charging dock with pretty lights (which does not work)Ability to latch usb cable to front of mouse to use as a wired mouse, in case charge runs out.Cons:Battery life is about 1 to 2 hours, so you have to use it as a wired mouse.Battery completely died after about 2 months of use.Purchased a $20 replacement battery, which either arrived DOA, or something in the mouse is malfunctioning.Horrible tracking &ndash; mouse jitters on mid to high DPI settings.Mouse randomly stops tracking completely, requiring you to either reboot or unplug/replug your usb cable.With Razer Synapse 2.0 software, the mouse is no longer recognized and is therefore not configurable. The mouse is now stuck on a super low-DPI setting &ndash; I need to move the mouse all the way across my mouse pad about 3 times to get the cursor from one side of the screen to the other (the DPI buttons do not do anything when the mouse is not recognized in Synapse). My button bindings no longer work either.&mdash;When Synapse was still working:Configuration settings are not consistent between having the charging dock plugged in and having the mouse plugged in directly.Configuration settings do not stay consistent between OS reboots.Configuration settings sometimes seem to change randomly during regular use.Configuration settings are randomly reset and cannot be recovered.Poor configuration settings compared to Logitech &ndash; I wanted to bind the &ldquo;back&rdquo; button to minimize the active window, but this cannot be achieved &ndash; there is no option for a &ldquo;minimize window&rdquo; action, and the shortcut Alt+Space+M cannot be bound in Synapse, and does not function properly when recorded as a macro.Awful, awful product. Don&rsquo;t waste your money. Even though I have a BlackWidow Ultimate Keyboard that works fine (at the moment), this mouse has completely turned me off Razer and I will never buy from them again.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="would-not-recommend-buying-this">Would Not Recommend Buying This</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great mouse. I love how you can make it wireless and cabled. The problem I have with the mouse is the Z-Axis. Over time, the mouse randomly moves slowly downwards and to the right. The only fix I know is to put it back on the charger stand and let it sit there for 15-30 minutes. It&rsquo;s a known issue and Razer has yet to fix it. Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this mouse due to this known issue. Also, the Razer software is truly outdated and doesn&rsquo;t work correctly. I&rsquo;ve requested to have the website and the software updated. As you can see, that has yet to happen. Everything about razer seems cool, like their products and such, but their service and software is just plain OFF. I would not recommend buying this product. Even today I still use this mouse and have a cooler master wired mouse. Though, when I get more money, I&rsquo;ll be buying the Steelseries wireless gaming mouse. At least their products and software are always up to date.READ MORE</p>
