<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-germaphobes">Great for Germaphobes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Most bacteria growth can be stopped or reduced with only 30 seconds of UV exposure. This thing blasts it for 6 minutes. Anyone who has taken a microbiology course will recommend this in a heartbeat. The batteries last quite a while as well. Loofas or Bath toys can also be set outside on a sunny day to inhibit bacterial growth. I recommend once every two weeks or so.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-live-without">Can&rsquo;t Live Without</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really consider myself a huge germaphobe, but one thing that has always grossed me out when traveling was leaving my toothbrush lying about because I didn&rsquo;t have some sort of slot for it. I&rsquo;d usually come up with some sort of contraption, like a plastic cup or something to hold it, but there&rsquo;s something about leaving your toothbrush open to the air in a foreign environment that doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me. Yes, you could use one of those basic plastic toothbrush travel holders and leave it on the counter or wherever, but let me tell you why this is so much better.Over a year ago, I searched for a solution to my at home environment toothbrush situation because I ran into similar issues as above, having the toothbrush just sitting there, granted in a nicer holder, but open to the environment collecting dust and just eating up all the bacteria when one flushes the toilet or even showers and it gets humid. I actually bought the family version UV sanitizer, just for myself, from this brand and never looked back. An enclosed, bacteria killing environment, what could be better (and safer)? Love that product, but this review is obviously not about it, so let&rsquo;s go back to the travel version.I mentioned the family version because, since owning that, my expectations were always much higher in the hygiene department, and when traveling, I was forced to live like I used to prior to owning a sanitizer. This sibling UV sanitizer makes me so sane I can&rsquo;t even explain it. Now having something for your toothbrush on the go that A, kills the potentially dangerous bacteria lurking around in a bathroom that other people have used, and B, always gives you a place to store it, free from dust and whatever else is floating around, is totally awesome. It really is.Now, you may be skeptical with the whole UV ray killing the bacteria thing, and to be quite frank, anyone who uses a product like this really has no idea that it&rsquo;s working. However, this is how I look at it. Even if it&rsquo;s not killing any bacteria, which I highly, highly doubt, you now have a secure place that still encapsulates your brush and protects it from the environment and from when people use the bathroom. Having the bristles to your brush out and about is disgusting, it really is, and other plastic travel holders don&rsquo;t create a &ldquo;home&rdquo; like this one does. So, if you&rsquo;re skeptical, this travel one is atleast doing that, and you can hope it&rsquo;s killing the bacteria (which is highly probable) too. If it helps, since using this and the family version, I haven&rsquo;t been sick in over a year and have even kissed sick people (yum). Related? Who knows, but it can&rsquo;t hurt.In terms of the physicality of the device, it&rsquo;s definitely astetically pleasing and has a good feel to it. It&rsquo;s built well. It requires 2 AAA batteries (wish they used double), and is turned on every single time the unit closes. In order to conserve battery life, they really should have implemented a button, because once in a while you may run it accidentally or unnecessarily. I don&rsquo;t know how long the travel version will last on batteries, for my family version is plugged in, but I will update this review when it dies to give you an estimate. It should fit all your standard toothbrushes as well, and lines up perfectly to the bristles. One con that I&rsquo;ll just throw into this review that has always annoyed me with these products is that it doesn&rsquo;t sanitize the back of the brush. Both sides go into your mouth, so wouldn&rsquo;t it logically make sense to clean it all? Apparently, as I learned from a friend, bacteria is just way more susceptible to lurk on the bristles because of the material, over the rubber used on the back of the brush, so it&rsquo;s not as necessary, but eh. I sometimes turn my brush around in the family version to get both sides, and I actually just tested if I could do this in the travel version, and you can! I&rsquo;ll post a picture.And yeah, I think that&rsquo;s everything. Great, great product. Love both of mine two death. Do note that I received this travel santitzer at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and this is just that. I take pride in my reviews and would gladly rank any product down if it didn&rsquo;t work up to my expectations. However, this not being the case, I truly do recommend this sanitizer. Also, if it makes you feel better, I bought the family version full price :)</p>

<h5 id="usability-and-function-could-use-some-work-otherwise-it-does-its-job">Usability and function could use some work, otherwise it does its job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real way for me to verify that it actually works, so I&rsquo;ll just focus on the usability aspects:1) Even though it&rsquo;s &ldquo;portable&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not really meant to be treated roughly. Definitely make sure it has enough room and doesn&rsquo;t get smashed because the hinges are flimsy.2) I also didn&rsquo;t really like the rubber &ldquo;positioner grippy thing&rdquo; for the toothbrush head. It assumes all toothbrushes are the same and they clearly are not. If you have an odd shaped toothbrush with &ldquo;ergonomic&rdquo; bends or &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; shaped heads, the grip makes it hard to position the bristles directly at the UV light.3) (minor thing) There&rsquo;s no ON button. On is automatic when you close the lid. (Off is automatically timed.) This is a bit annoying, especially when changing batteries, or positioning your toothbrush.</p>

<h5 id="solved-how-to-hold-small-brush-heads-in-this-sanitizer">SOLVED! How to hold small brush heads in this sanitizer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this SteriClean FAMILY UV Toothbrush Sanitizer for almost a month now. I&rsquo;d been happy enough with my old VioLife VIO100 sanitizer, but wanted to try out a new style with the UV bulb on top of the device, as opposed to in the cup. Overall, I think the bulb in this Oral SteriClean does a great job: it&rsquo;s BIG and BRIGHT, so I&rsquo;m assuming it has good UV power? My main challenge - as mentioned by several other posters - was how to hold the small brush heads on devices made by OralB and SonicCare f&rsquo;instance. Well folks, I&rsquo;ve SOLVED it! I just went to my local office supply store and bought a few rubber fingers. Yup, these perforated, grippy little fingertips hold a small brush head perfectly - as you can see for yourself in my photos. So don&rsquo;t hesitate to buy this sanitizer, but get a few rubber fingers to hold your brush heads. Um, note to product development at Oral SteriClean: you might want to partner with OfficeMax, hnh? &gt;:-) Or maybe just come up with a better way to hold small brush heads in your own sanitizer.</p>

<h5 id="dead-after-only-6-months-update-07-08-14">Dead after Only 6 Months - UPDATE: 07/08/14</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cheap quality should have been my first warning. I purchased two of these. One for my wife and I and another for our children. One has died completely and the other works occasionally after opening and closing the slide door many, many times.This product is expensive junk.07/08/2014UPDATE***********I read the company&rsquo;s response comments to me regarding their Return policy and emailed them my order information and address.Within a week I received TWO brand new units free of charge and they both are working great as of this posting.Because they have stood behind their products, I have updated my rating/review to 5 stars. If they last at least a few years I will consider it a good purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-not-for-long">Works but not for long</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works most of the time. Sometimes it fails to light up and i have to open a close it a few times. Then other times that it fails and doesn&rsquo;t come back on I usually end up replacing the batteries. It seems like it goes through batteries every month. Need to get rechargeable batteries for this.I also find that I need to wipe it out at least once a month. I see some yellowish stuff on the inside near the bottom of the brush. A quick wipe down and it is good as new.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Update&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-After about a year it drains the batteries every day. I think it just turns on but doesn&rsquo;t turn off anymore until the batteries die. Looking now for something else.</p>

<p>I have had two of these. They both died after a few months use. Definitely not worth $20.00</p>

<p>After 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months, it no longer works despite changing the battery. Also you must have a thin toobrush handle to fit in the allocated slot. I hope I can get a refund or credit.</p>
