<h5 id="works-with-my-black-lab">Works with my Black Lab</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 8 year old black lab named Brudis. At first I thought this was going to be a nightmare to put on, but I was able to do it in under 2 minutes the very first time. Brudis loves to wear this. I think it makes him feel like he has a job. The quality over all is pretty good. It stays straight for the most part, but with all the running, hitting trees, and running into misc. things, you will have to make adjustments or straiten it back out. As for the footage, the top mount is way better than the bottom mount. The bottom footage is really shaky, clunky from the dogs legs or what not. The top mount gives a good POV of the dogs head and what they&rsquo;re getting into. I would recommend using superview 1080p by 60fps, just because dogs run fast! I&rsquo;ve tested in the water and it seems to dry within 5 hours or so. It&rsquo;s also a real head turner. Having your dog go up to strangers and get petted, just seeing their reaction is priceless. I give it a 4 out of 5 bc I do have to adjust it every so often, a hard thing to get around. I would only recommend this for medium to large dogs. This will not work on the taco bell dog.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-headstrap">Awesome Headstrap!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this headstrap! So far I&rsquo;ve wore it for a half marathon, kayaking, and snorkeling. All with great results.First of all, the strap is very comfortable. If I wear it above a hat I barely notice it&rsquo;s there. The strap is adjustable so you can get a tight fit and not have to worry about it falling off during filming. I had no problem wearing this during my half marathon, other than the fact I looked like a total nerd&hellip;Second, the shaking on the film is not bad. The whole point of getting a GoPro is to see from the actor&rsquo;s perspective. So if I&rsquo;m running, I expect to see movement. I debated about getting this or the chest strap for running and decided that a headstrap would avoid the back &amp; forth sway (yaw axis) you would get with a chest strap (not to mention your arms getting in the way). I&rsquo;m very happy with my choice. Checkout the video for the NYC Half: <a href="http://youtu.be/IzUJap3WcqwThird">http://youtu.be/IzUJap3WcqwThird</a>, the quick clip. I don&rsquo;t use it. If I had to buy this again I would just get the cheaper version without the quick clip.Normally the camera is screwed onto a hard plastic plate on the strap. The quick clip clips camera onto the plate, rather than being screwed onto it. I understand the point of the quick clip is to be able to get the GoPro off of your head without taking the whole strap off. I have not used this device because it doesn&rsquo;t look very secure. I would rather take the band off my head since it only takes a second to get it back on. The clip really freaks me out. I&rsquo;m curious to see if anyone else has had good experience with this thing.Lastly, couple of tips:1: After your GoPro is properly screwed onto the plate on the strap, you can still pivot it to point up or down to get the best filming angle (and then tighten the screw further if there&rsquo;s any slack). I didn&rsquo;t get this right the first time I took it snorkeling with me so I ended up filming ABOVE the water instead of all the amazing fish I saw under the surface.2: If you&rsquo;re filming a long event and can&rsquo;t leave the camera running on your head the whole time because battery power you can obviously get a spare battery. However, if you&rsquo;re running a race and can&rsquo;t finish within time one battery allows, set your on/off to recording, turn your beep to 100% volume and get familiar with the beep pattern on the GoPro. This will allow you to operate your GoPro without looking at the control display and know you&rsquo;re actually filming. Alternatively, you could use the remote or your cellphone, but the wifi would just suck more power out of your camera.Good luck and have fun!</p>

<h5 id="50-50"><sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am split <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> on this product. I used it on my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition and on some days it worked perfectly and on other days it did not work. Looked on Google and Youtube for help when inserting the fog inserts therefore I am sure that I put them in the best locations. On one snorkling trip no fog which was great but on a walking trip to the beach and then some swimming caused it to fog. Therefore it worked half the time even though new fog inserts were used.</p>

<h5 id="worried-about-losing-my-camera">Worried about losing my camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to mount my GoPro Hero 3 on my microlight trike aircraft, but tightening down the bolts bends the brackets so much I worry about them snapping and my camera plummeting to the ground to its ultimate demise. I ended up tightening just enough to hold, and then running a few zip ties around everything as an extra precaution. Further, the bolts aren&rsquo;t enclosed in the brackets. While this allows for easy on-off, if one gets loose from vibration, the whole thing can come off. Ok for non-critical applications, but next time I&rsquo;ll get something more solid. Photo taken with camera on this mount.</p>

<h5 id="for-the-price-point-i-say-it-s-pretty-spot-on-knowing-other-company-are-around-the-same">For the price point I say it&rsquo;s pretty spot on knowing other company are around the same &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was in the market looking for the hand grip for my GoPro 3+ black when I got an email saying GoPro came out with the handler. For the price point I say it&rsquo;s pretty spot on knowing other company are around the same price which is fine. Now for the product, this Handler is great! very comfortable in the hand. It has this grip that you can tell will last and it will no slip when wet. I will not be using it for its floating feature but i will be taking it to the mountain this season for snow boarding. With this handler coming with the adjustable wrist strap you are safe from losing your gopro. You can also take the strap off if needed. Comes with a gopro thumb screw which was a cool extra can&rsquo;t complain.Cons: just wish the mount at the top was metal instead of plastic. Im sure there will be no issue due to not taking impact.Overall great product!</p>
