<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="the-dentist-s-wife-says-i-like-them-and-they-are-affordable">The Dentist&rsquo;s wife says - I like them and they are affordable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are a nice alternative to the super expensive brush heads out there. I am married to a dentist and we have seen all that is out there as far as brush heads are concerned. They are a little softer but that is better since it will protect your enamel a little better. Hard brushes leave erosion lesions if one is not careful. I am happy with these brushes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-originals">Better than originals!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have very sensitive teeth and these toothbrush heads work perfectly with my Phillips Sonicare Series 2 toothbrush. I actually love these more than any of the replacement heads that Phillips makes. I immediately changed out the head that came with my toothbrush for one of these because they are so much more pleasant to brush with. Not only are they soft but they do just as great a job cleaning my teeth as the brand name ones. Plus they are WAYY more affordable than the crazy overpriced brand name replacement brushes. They also came with little rings you can change out at the base of the head so that you can identify which toothbrush is which if you and someone else in your household happen to have the same toothbrush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-alternative-to-the-official-replacements">Great Alternative to the Official Replacements</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, these absolutely are going to be my go-to replacement heads. They serve the same functionality as the included Sonicare heads but for a fraction of the cost. Whereas before I found these I was quite careful about my toothbrush heads and about packing them in the included bulky carrying case, I now feel free to throw one of these in my travel kit and just go.The quality seems fine for the price, and I&rsquo;m good with the bristle texture, so no complaints there. Just be sure that your Sonicare is the kind with the slide-on heads and not the screw-on, as these will not work with the latter.Bottom line:Even if you prefer the official replacement heads, these are such a good deal that I would recommend picking a pack up just so you can have something to throw in a travel kit and not worry about.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sparkling-clean">Sparkling Clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product! I have a Sonicare and anyone who has one knows how much the replacement heads can cost. I looked at several on line and went with this one and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. I wasn&rsquo;t sure they would fit my toothbrush because I don&rsquo;t know what model I have, but I went with it anyway and they fit perfect, work wonderfully and the price is fantastic. My teeth feel sparkling clean again! I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good product at a great value.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-well-made-heads-at-a-great-price">Very well made heads at a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These heads are very well made and fit on the Sonicare tooth brush like the original heads. They are a bit on the stiff side for me but that is my fault as I did not read that they were considered &ldquo;medium&rdquo; and what I really wanted was soft. I do find that they soften up quickly, say about 2 weeks, and then they become comfortable for me. I also find that the indicator bristles that signal it is time for a change wear down pretty fast but at this price, it&rsquo;s no big deal to change them often.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-for-the-price-and-high-performance-when-compared-to-others-im-sold">Great value for the price and high-performance when compared to others. Im sold.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these to try vs the china made ones I was already using for over 2 years and was very accustomed to the firmness those provided. During my initial use, I felt these Medium firmness heads were a bit too soft for me. However, after using these for over 2 months, I now feel this is the correct firmness for me. I have also learned that using the ultra stiff ones like the ones I was using can damage your gums! Ouch!I love the way Demirdental packages these BTW, I travel a lot for work and love having the 2 pack in a individual pouch. That&rsquo;s great for vacation too. I love having the individual head cover as well for the hotel room etc, that&rsquo;s pretty darn good too.Final thoughts, if you are used to the super hard ones (green ones from groupon) like I was and you feel these are too soft you - WAIT. Give it 4 weeks or so. Then you will love these and won&rsquo;t go back. One other thing to note, these seem to last longer. We used to change our china heads every month of so, i&rsquo;ve been using the same head for over 2 months and its retaining its performance just as day one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-i-will-likely-never-buy-the-sonicare-brand">Great buy. I will likely never buy the Sonicare brand.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was honestly very worried about these being they are so much cheaper than the heads that came with my Sonicare. Once I got them I noticed how well they were packages and they when I ran my finger across the bristles, none of them came loose. They are a little softer than the plaque heads that I had, but the shape is wonderful and had done an amazing job of cleaning my teeth. Not to mention you get 6 for less that 2 of the original. Great if not better alternative.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-no-complaints">Great product! No complaints.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical about these because they price was so good. I figured at this low cost, bristles would be breaking off in my mouth etc&hellip; but the other reviewers convinced me to give them a try. Im glad I did&hellip; The ONLY difference I find between these and the Sonicare brand are that these are a little stiffer. No big deal.. just use less pressure as you brush. Besides, its friction not pressure that gets teeth clean! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-them">Love them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love them and were half the price of the original toothbrush heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The heads are to big</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-good-as-the-original-head">Not as good as the original head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Work well. Not as good as the original head, but for the price, I&rsquo;m impressed</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-in-the-dental-field-for-30-years-and-love-my-toothbrush">&hellip; worked in the dental field for 30 years and love my toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have worked in the dental field for 30 years and love my toothbrush! These brush head replacements are excellent! The price is excellent!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent replacement at half price</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars-1">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work but don&rsquo;t last very long. You might get a couple weeks out of each one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality is on par with OEM at a much lower price.</p>
