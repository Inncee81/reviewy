<h5 id="tldr-good-unit-fair-price-make-some-improvements-and-you-got-yourself-a-home-run">TLDR; Good unit; fair price; Make some improvements and you got yourself a home run</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 2 for my children. They seem to like it but I thought I would share my thoughts:PROS:1. It does not weight much which is great;2. LED light is fairly bright;IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:1. Make the clip wider and taller so it is more stable when clipped onto a book;2. It has an USB plug and jack but the connection to the light is RJ9? Why not use a micro USB connector on the lighting unit so if I lose this cable, I can still recharge using micro USB cable from a phone?3. The light casts a bluish light; I would have preferred a natural, warmer light that is not so harsh on eyes;4. There aren&rsquo;t much differences between low and high light settings; I would like to see the low lighting to go lower to maximize battery time;5. When the charging cord is plugged into the light AND the plug (but not plugged into a wall outlet), the indicator light on the plug stays on which probably will drain the battery from the lighting unit;TLDR; Good unit; fair price; Make some improvements and you got yourself a home runKevin Young</p>

<h5 id="excellent-light-in-all-respects-except-for-one">EXCELLENT Light in all respects &hellip; except for one &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little light works great. Battery life is excellent. I use it lighting music score in live Broadway Musicals and it gives a great amount of light that is really constrained to where it needs to be and doesn&rsquo;t light anything else. It is super flexible so directing the light to exactly the right spot is a cinch. The battery charges very fast with is a plus. The spring is solid so the light stays put. I would have given this light five stars except that the USB charger cable is NOT A STANDARD micro or mini USB connector. It is a special cable that has a USB A connector on one end and the other end that plugs into the light is a co-axial connector, like the typical 9v and 5v round connectors with the hole in the center and the sleeve the other connector. If you lose this cable or break it you&rsquo;re toast. You can&rsquo;t just grab any old USB cable - you have to have this special cable. I have dozens of cables at home but no other cable like this one. Great light, really, but a poor decision to have a non-standard USB cable.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-me">PERFECT FOR ME!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the little things in life that make huge impacts. This book light is exactly what I needed. The 2 levels of brightness, the lightweight yet effective clamp and the adjustable neck has made reading at night easier and much more enjoyable for me. I initially debated on whether or not to purchase a less expensive light for fear I wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied. I am very pleased to report that it has exceeded my expectations. It is well worth the price. I highly recommend this book light. ❤️Update: After a month or 2, the light would only luminate to its maximum potential if plugged in the entire time. It became very inconvenient, and no longer useful. I&rsquo;ll be purchasing a book light with batteries that I can change out. No more rechargeable booklights for me. Very disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-great-for-aquariums">Awesome. Great for aquariums.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these things I use them as lights for my aquatic frogs the clip makes them versatile and they hold a good charge I have had one for over a year and will admit that it doesn&rsquo;t hold a charge to well anymore but I use them every night. The reason I use these over the lights in the lids of my aquariums is because they are the perfect brightness and can keep on setting one if you want to keep it dim. If you click on the long fluorescent tune light in the aquarium lid my frogs freak out and are a pain to feed. They are also awesome for reading or power outages! I would recomend these to anyone as someone who now owns two I thought they deserved a good review.Cons: the big part of the charger may break at some point (the part that lights up green when your light is charged). Even though it broke the cable is USB compatible so you can still charge the light you just don&rsquo;t know when it is fully charged. GREAT PRODUCT don&rsquo;t buy another reading light</p>

<h5 id="this-little-light-of-mine">This little light of mine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this light. I really tried to research which one to get before buying one and decided on the silver version of this light as I read it has 6 lights as opposed to the black version which has 4 lights ( what the difference was in the first place was not very clear ). I felt it might more evenly distribute the light. My concern was with the bright light and whether it would disturb my sleep and I must admit I wish they would come out with a soft light but I seem to have no difference in my sleep pattern when I use my Kindle with it&rsquo;s soft light and this light. I really have trouble reading in low light so I even find myself using this light indoors during the day sometimes. The low would probably be fine for most but I find the high makes a world of difference for me. It does not disturb my husband but nothing would disturb that &ldquo;bear&rdquo;. I did find that a question I had when researching was would it be too heavy for paperbacks and I never was quite sure I got a good answer. It is fine. I mostly use it for the larger paperbacks and it is not too heavy. I attach it to the top of the side of the book I have the least number of pages on and actually kind of use it as my bookmark. It is not too heavy and is very flexible. I highly recommend this light. Oh and the company is very responsible it seems and checks with you to see if you have received the light and if you have any questions.</p>

<h5 id="rechargeable-dim-able-book-light-led">Rechargeable dim able book light- led</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got this today and my daughter and I are so impressed that I couldn&rsquo;t wait to write the review&ndash; it&rsquo;s fantastic!! It lights up both pages at the same time! It has 2 settings so in bed it isn&rsquo;t too bright for my husban as he sleeps. As you can see from my pictures it has a clip that is big enough but soft to not rip pages. Adjusting to the pages nicely also. The neck of the light is fully adjustable and STAYS WHERE I PUT IT unlike others I have that I constantly have to reposition. Love it! Works so great!! LED lights are great and not harsh to read by. It will charge by USB/micro USB OR with the included Wall charger attachment. It&rsquo;s comfortable in my hand while holding my books too. It&rsquo;s clasp will hold onto bed frames etc for others uses also. Great quality product I recommend highly!Received for free for my honest review</p>
