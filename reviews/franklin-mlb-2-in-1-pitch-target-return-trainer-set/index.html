<blockquote>
<p>bought this product to help my son with his pitching. After setting this up my son realized how inaccurate he was lol. The side with the catcher has a hole in the strike zone that serves as a catch that release the ball into a bag that collects the balls. Very clever design. The other side is a net that is secured tightly to give a lot of spring action to repel the ball easily. The instructions in the box are user friendly &amp; it only took 10-15 min to set up. All the parts were labeled by number so it was just simply 1,2,3, most of all my son will lean with this product &amp; can see what&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s doing wrong.</p>

<h5 id="great-purchase-for-our-son">Great purchase for our son!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son was given this for his 8th Birthday. He loves it! We worried that he would have issues with the ball coming back to him. Which is the reason we bought it. He always wants to play catch and unfortunately we are not always able so he ended up throwing a ball against the garage. This particular net works great for coming back at him. Depending on where it hits the net it may come back to him higher as a popfly which is great for his eye, hand coordnation strengthening skills. Overall it&rsquo;s a great purchase and he was very excited to use it!</p>

<h5 id="problems-out-of-the-box">Problems out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disappointing that this item started breaking and we put bungees on. Some of the pipes didn&rsquo;t even have holes predrilled. Franklin is a bigger name in the sports products, so it was sad I had to go by parts to make this function as its supposed to. Don&rsquo;t buy this item find something better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-practice-for-accuracy">Great practice for accuracy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this product for my son to really practice his aim from the mound. He throws 50 pitches a day into this and in a week he went from 16 strikes out of 50 to 31. This has helped him so much on his accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk-waste-of-money">Junk, waste of money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This broke after just a few uses. Very disappointing for my sons. Called Franklin, but they never sent us the part we needed to make it functional again. Was too much of a hassle to try to return to Amazon, as it we already put it together and is a large item requiring a very big box.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality-cheap-parts">Poor quality, cheap parts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Part (9), The hooks that gold the target, 2 of the broke within the first 10 pitches. This product is cheaply made, and I now know not worth the money. I will have to invest more money in better Bungie to secure the target. That’s a shame&hellip;</p>

<p>nice idea, but the catcher sheet is very flimsy. pulls so tight it rips apart at the hooks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plastic hooks broke after 10 minutes of play with a 9 year old boy. Bottom snap broke after one use. I&rsquo;m returning this if one more thing goes wrong. We are disappointed, but 9 year old wants to keep using it until it is no longer fun. Sheesh!!!!</p>

<p>Garbage. To start, worse than IKEA instructions. After we got it set up, one of the bungees that holds the catchers side broke in less than 10 pitches from at 8 year old.</p>
