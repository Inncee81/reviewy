<h5 id="love-this-cable-plug-play-take-your-ios-device-and-project-onto-the-big-screen-hdtv">Love this cable. Plug &amp; Play! Take your iOS device and project onto the big screen- HDTV. :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My photos say it all. Kimwood makes an awesome HDTV cable! It works solely with iPhones, iPods, and iPads with iOS 8-10. It has an HDMI adaptor on one end, and a lightning head on the other end. The cable also has a USB cable for power to plug into your viewing screen as well. This makes for a handy little tool! It is literally a Plug and Play product!Take your presentations to the big screen! Show off your photos to a crowd! Play a game and just spoil yourself by seeing it FULL SCREEN LARGE! Want to FaceTime someone and have your whole group see the iPhone or iPad but the screen is just not large enough? Project onto a larger screen (such as a television) and now everyone can see what&rsquo;s happening! Maybe you just want to see your loved one up close and personal&hellip;.This HDTV cable can be used to project onto ANY screen with an HDMI port hook-up. :) So happy with this purchase! Please check out my detailed photos walking you through the set-up process (though instructions are most definitely included and clear).The cable is 2M long, so you may want to tie it up. I used a velcro tie as indicated in one of my photos. The device can sit horizontally or flat at any point in time. You can also use a typical hands-free phone stand (to support it horizontally) as shown in one of my photos. **FaceTime only supports vertical positioning, though, and you can either hold your device, or position it in such a way to not overbend the lightning head of the cord. My family, myself included, have broken plenty of cords by overpressing it at the head where it plugs into the device. The stress breaks the cable. I made a little stand using the top of a kid&rsquo;s cup that has a straw hole (to sit the iPhone on without overstressing/overbending the lightning head) and I used a speaker to work as a surface for the iPhone to lean against. Now I have a perfect vertical hands-free stand of my own, and I can use this cable to help me FaceTime family on the big television.Awesome cable, great big viewing, use for pleasure or business. 5 stars! (Of course you know I suggested to the seller to work on a stand for vertical use&hellip; ;) )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to say that I didn&rsquo;t expect much from this cable at first, but it works great. I have a iPhone 6s+ and a iPad Pro 12.9&rdquo; that I tried with this cable and oth devices work. The picture was perfect on the tv, and showed everything on my phone. YouTube lets you watch videos through this cable giving you a huge options of ways to watch movies with more people being able to view at the same time. I used it to go online to read articles, watch movies, and view photos with my friends and family, i was even able to brows through Facebook with no problems. Some services like HULU or NETFLIX will not work as the content is not able to be played on a second screen. All in all this cable does exactly what it says it will do. I have to say that it arrived very quickly, and the seller is very nice and will answer any questions that you may have! I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to share their favorite moments, photos or even a movie without having to pass around the phone. Move your pictures to the BIG screen. I would buy this cable again if something happened to it! It even let me open the camera and view it on the tv as well!!</p>

<h5 id="great-and-inexpensive-way-to-view-your-phone-on-a-bigger-screen">Great (and inexpensive) way to view your phone on a bigger screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently received the Kimwood Lightning Digital Adapter Cable and I am very happy wth my purchase. The cord is a convenient way to not only have a charger for your phone but also a way to project your phone on to a larger screen for viewing. The dual attached plugs allow you to charge the phone while using it as well which comes in handy when I&rsquo;m watching a longer video on my phone that would normally drain a lot of the charge. The cord itself is a pretty long length to allow you the luxury of using the phone while attached to any larger screen. The cord has some limitations to which aps it&rsquo;ll project but I mostly use YouTube which is compatible with the device. The picture comes through perfectly as well so it&rsquo;s a great way to see everything on a much larger scale (without breaking the bank). The dual function charger and projector was the main selling point for me since I now leave it in my backpack and have both a charger with me wherever I go and a mens to project pictures and videos to a larger screen whenever I&rsquo;m out of the house. I highly recommend this inexpensive cable for everyone who ever wants to share things from their phone with others on a much larger scale than cell phones normally allow.</p>

<h5 id="easily-get-media-to-any-tv">Easily get media to any TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My family travels a lot, so I purchased the Lightning to HDMI so that we can play movies from my iPhone 7 to any modern TV. It&rsquo;s a fairly simple set-up, plug in the HDMI cable to the TV, plug in the usb to a power supply and of course the lighting cable to the phone. Once connected, change the input to the proper channel and you&rsquo;re iPhone will display in it&rsquo;s current mode (landscape or portrait).If you play a movie in landscape mode, you&rsquo;ll have full screen resolution on the television.This works well in multiple instances: You have the content stored on your phone (like a movie) and if you have decent bandwidth to stream the media. I find this to be much easier than setting up an Apple TV, connecting it to the wifi and then only getting the channels I subscribe to (not a full web browser capability).You can also use this for presentations (Keynote for example).I think this is a really nice tool for a wide variety of reasons and I highly recommend grabbing one! It makes a great stocking stuffer 😊</p>
