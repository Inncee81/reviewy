<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to mount a 43&rdquo; Plasma HDTV to my wall, and is the first time I have ever mounted a television to a wall. Instructions were clear and I like the fact that the kit came all the screws necessary to complete the project. For me, the only challenging part was getting the correct spacers and VESA screws installed. I had some confusion with what length of screw could be installed with or without the spacers. I ended up using the longer screw with the spacer which was the right combination.The bracket still feels solid after installation - there are no signs of bending or warping. This bracket is a great value for cost sensitive consumers that do not want to spend upwards of $100 on a mount that your local big box store sells. This solution gets the job done.</p>

<h5 id="i-think-it-s-a-good-cheap-rout-to-have">I think it&rsquo;s a good cheap rout to have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It held up my moms 50&rdquo; LG TV with no problems. I will admit it was a little bit smaller than I expected, but the only reason why I think it is small is due to the long large one I bought years ago that is nearly double the size. Since it is not that ling, you have less frame to work with to center on your walls. Because you have to screw these wall mounts on the studs. With that said, I was able to mount it up with all kinds of screws and little level it came with. It also came with an HDMI cable as a bonus I guess, you can always use extra hdmi cables!Her TV has been mounted for 4+ months now and holding strong. I think it&rsquo;s a good cheap rout to have.</p>

<p>Great price for this item. Showed up on schedule and packaged safely. Great alternative to the expensive stuff. I would definitely recommend this product and seller. Comes with bags of screws and spacers to ensure a proper fit from brackets to TV.</p>

<h5 id="easy-instructions-tough-to-get-the-tv-mounted-if-you-have-multiple-cords-hdmi-component-etc">Easy instructions, tough to get the TV mounted if you have multiple cords (HDMI, component etc)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, I would probably honestly get this again. The price is great, and its well made despite its shortcomings, and comes with good extras (level, HDMI cable). I would not recommend this if your audio/video out plugs are near the bottom of your TV. Getting the frame on the wall was easy, and so was attacking the braces to the TV. Everything is very straightforward, instructions are easy, and had plenty of hardware. The tough parts:1) even using the spacers provided, the TV is &ldquo;holy crap&rdquo; close to the wall (to be fair, it is advertised this way). It seems nice, but the issue is that it doesn&rsquo;t even leave enough room for the plugs. Power, HDMI, component, they all hit the wall. This makes tilting the TV difficult if they are on the bottom end of the unit, because they will hit the wall and prevent you from being able to tilt it fully. It also makes it difficult to lock in the bottom hooks, because you need to jam the TV into the wall and feel like you will break it, and there&rsquo;s a good chance the cords will get in the way.2) You cannot tilt the TV until AFTER you have the brackets 100% connected (aka the bottom half). This is tough because there is very little room to reach the screws once its on the wall. I was able to loosen them so it just kind of tilted forward and rested, but it creates an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; situation in terms of tilt. You can either have it flush, or tilted 10 degrees, no trying to find a middle spot.Overall though, still happy with it. The price can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>

<h5 id="looks-great-very-sturdy">Looks great, very sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Coming from a female who had never put a wall mount up, and is moderately handy, I was able to figure it out and get it put up in about an hour and a half. Now that I&rsquo;ve done it once, If I had to do it again, it would probably take me less than 30. The most important part is to have the right tools.One comment I have is that in the directions, when putting the initial thicker bolts into the wall to put the frame up, it instructs you to use a much smaller drill bit than you need to use&hellip; I ended up using the size of the drill bit it asked for, and then going up a size at a time until I could get the bolt into the drywall and eventually into the stud behind (snugly). The drill bit I ended with was 3x thicker than the one the instructions called for. And I&rsquo;m probably 95% certain I did it right&hellip;Otherwise, simple enough! Looks great, very sturdy. Looks to use good quality, thick metal. I was worried about it being so inexpensive, as wall mounts that you&rsquo;d buy from a tech store will cost you 2-3 times mlre than this, but I have no complaints and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-and-easy-to-install">Sturdy and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super easy to install, very customizable for different tvs, also loved how it came with different solutions for unusual framings as well (we used solution 2 with some extra wood to mount it) also tilts very well and holds steady to the wall!</p>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great item! Installed myself with no problems. I will add that I have never installed a tv wall mount before. I did watch a couple youtube videos first. Came with enough bolts and washers to get just the right fit for my tv. Cannot believe how affordable it is, and very sturdy. Will come back here for my future needs. Bought it for my craft room to watch Netflix and Youtube videos. I installed a TCL Roku tv, and loaded enough apps that I can watch live tv (via the various network apps), and didn&rsquo;t need to get another box from my Satellite provider.I also purchased this item:<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8BXIE4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8BXIE4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10</a>, to provide a longer cord for my wall mounted tv. Next step is to drop the wires behind the wall. You can&rsquo;t beat the availability of necessary items on Amazon. Saved me tons of money purchasing here. And, I would say this is equal to any other retail items.</p>

<h5 id="good-value-mount">Good value mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is good quality steel and engineering. Everything matches up well and felt strong. It took me about an hour to mount, included unpacking, reading directions several times, finding studs, etc.I mounted an older 42&rdquo; Toshiba in the garage and it looks great and is very stable. This is a nice kit as it gives you a variety of screws to fit your tv. Make sure you adjust the tilt before mounting tv to the wall.I used a socket / 10 mm to get the lag screws into the studs nice and tight/flush on the mount.</p>
