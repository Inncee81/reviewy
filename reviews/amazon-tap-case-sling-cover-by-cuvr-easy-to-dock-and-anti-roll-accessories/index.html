<p>CUVR has fantastic reviews from Amazon customers worldwide:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smart! It protects my Tap and you don&rsquo;t have to remove it to use charger base. Well made. Currently half the cost of the Amazon product and better designed. Same quality materials and workmanship. Recommended (John Row - USA)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great case! Easy to put on, secure fit, lightweight. Like the hexagonal (anti-roll) design. Fits perfectly on the charging base, no adjustments necessary. And half the price of the Amazon cover!&rdquo; (Marty G - USA)  </p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="overall-pretty-good">Overall - Pretty Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>On the first day that my Tap arrived, I noticed that exterior is wrapped in a fabric mesh material.Great when handling with clean hands, but with dirty hands, not so much.I personally got white spackle embedded into several fabric pockets.I really enjoy the Tap and carry it around the house while listening to a lot more diverse content that my old FM radio can generate.But if I have to wash my hands every time I pick it up, that&rsquo;s not great.I got an orange sling case and this has helped with several issues.First, dirty hands are OK. Just hook the finger loop and carry.Second, the no roll feature is great as I don&rsquo;t always set the Tap on perfectly flat surfaces.Third, Orange makes the Tap easier to locate with almost 60 year old eyes.The one issue I have noted is some slight slippage from the top of the unit.Don&rsquo;t know how much shock and vibration this cover can tolerate but to those looking at carrying it on a bike, I&rsquo;d advise to start out low and slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fair-price-solid-construction-does-what-it-s-advertised-to-do">Fair price. Solid construction. Does what it&rsquo;s advertised to do.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works on the newest Amazon Tap design. The old design of sling covers required you to remove the cover in order to access the charging base inductive charger, however, this design has a cutout.I tested it on my desk and on the carpeted floor. It&rsquo;s a simple design that does stop it from falling over at slight nudges or bumps, but any stronger push than that, and it will fall over, obviously. It just helps it become a little more secure.I don&rsquo;t imagine this will provide much in the form of protection. Then again, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be advertised as a protective case. It&rsquo;s geared towards &ldquo;anti-roll&rdquo; and as a sling cover. There&rsquo;s a loop on the end that you could use to hang it from a hook or a nail or something. You could also hook it onto a backpack when going on a hike.Texture: It&rsquo;s fairly thick silicone that has a lot of friction - it&rsquo;s rough silicone (it&rsquo;s not smooth or buttery/slippery as some silicone is). Not really a negative for me, but wanted to give you the heads up. Some people are into textures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-protection-for-my-new-tap">Good protection for my new Tap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice snug fit rubberized cover to protect, hang, lay down and charge my Tap. Once Amazon made the tap hands free, and found a new one at HD for $98, I finally decided to add one to my home automation Wink/Amazon ecosphere.Pros:- As mentioned, take your time when putting it on as it is a snug fit, but once you get it started, it seems to slide on easier.- It sits on the charger with ease and spins around as it can when outside of the case- For $9.95 on Amazon a good deal for the protection and hanging flexibility!One downside it that the soft rubbery surface seems to attract dust</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-also-love-that-i-can-still-use-the-cradle-to-charge">I also love that I can still use the cradle to charge &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits well over my Amazon Tap. I also love that I can still use the cradle to charge it with the case on. It moves slightly around because of its flexible material, but it still is protecting it. I use my Tap everywhere and I know it&rsquo;s safe with this case on it. Due to it being made of silicone, dirt and such can get attached to it, but it&rsquo;s easy to clean off. All around I&rsquo;m happy with my purchase and it was well worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-reason-not-to-buy-this-thing-for-any-tap-owner">No reason not to buy this thing for any Tap owner.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very careful with my electronics, but the Amazon Tap is meant to be a grab-and-go device. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, as they say. However, convenience often trumps other concerns and I knew that if I was going to get a cover for my Tap it would only get used if I didn&rsquo;t have to remove it for charging. This product from Cuvr is the best compromise between protection and convenience. It doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the charging cradle at all. Sure, if I drop the tap on the bottom the sling cover isn&rsquo;t going to help much. But I love the flat sides that allow me to both put the Tab at an angle, should I choose, and reduce the chances it will roll away if it falls over. And it&rsquo;s very affordable alternative to other cases with many color options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cover-to-sling-the-tap-around-in">Great cover to sling the Tap around in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So, I got the Tap to keep on my nightstand. And yay!!!!! Amazon upgraded Tap to enable by voice command just like the Echo. Only now, my Tap frequently sprouts legs and travels to different rooms in the house with my 11 year old using it to play various songs or help with his homework (like Alexa is smarter than his mother&hellip;..whatever). That being said, I was afraid it would get dropped and dented or broken. So I bought this sling cover and it is the best thing ever. Still fits on the charger great and now I don&rsquo;t have to worry about my Tap getting bumped or dented while entertaining my child who carries it by the nifty little loop handle. AND it doesn&rsquo;t roll off my nightstand when I accidentally knock it over. Win for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-found-the-silicone-anti-roll-cuvr-easy-to-slip-over-my-amazon-tap">I have found the silicone anti-roll Cuvr easy to slip over my Amazon Tap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have found the silicone anti-roll Cuvr easy to slip over my Amazon Tap. Whats more, it easily sits on the charger without need to push the sleeve up. It is well made with development and manufacturing consideration to protect the item for which it was intended. It is non-slip with adequate access to engage the Tap&rsquo;s various functions. If you are looking for a functional sleeve to protect your Tap, I would strongly urge you to consider this item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-new-case">LOVE this new case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received my case today, and just now put it on. My first impressions are that the material is thick, love the pink color, and appreciate the opening at the end, because now I don&rsquo;t have to slide my Amazon brand case off when I want to dock it. I also love the fact that it&rsquo;s anti-roll&hellip;it&rsquo;s ingenious! I also agree that for half the price of the Amazon brand, this is waaay better (and I bought the Amazon case)!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the case and Tap charges just fine with the case on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wish-i-could-have-gotten-the-one-with-the-strap">wish i could have gotten the one with the strap &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>wish i could have gotten the one with the strap on the bottom to protect my tap a little more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-really-well-and-does-not-slip-out-also">Fits really well and does not slip out. Also &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits really well and does not slip out. Also is able to be used with the charging base without any issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love that my Tap does not roll around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-really-nice-being-able-to-just-set-it-on-the-charger">It&rsquo;s really nice being able to just set it on the charger &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have 2 of these on two different taps and they work well. My wife and daughter both use the loop, and the shape stops it from rolling away when dropped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="colorful-protection">Colorful protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice product. Doesn&rsquo;t interfer with docking, protects from falls and protects the TAP from accidentally rolling off thr counter. Love the color choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-the-oem-one-from-amazon">Better than the OEM one from Amazon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it much more than the one I purchased originally. Can charge on the dock, even with this on. Now I never have to take it off!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits my Amazon Tap well and has the bonus of being able to charge without taking off the CUVR. Loop makes a great way to carry my Tap with me wherever I go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-alternative-to-amazon-s-sling-cover">Good alternative to Amazon&rsquo;s sling cover</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty good and much cheaper than what Amazon is asking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-addition-for-amazon-tap">Great addition for Amazon tap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. Easy to install, stylish and stops speaker from rolling if knocked over.</p>
