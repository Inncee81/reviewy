<h5 id="a-year-later">A year later..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned a few different Logitech accessories over the years and loved them all. Have owned this keyboard and mouse set for over a year now and LOVE IT. Never had any problems with it. Functions as it should and does it well. Batteries last a long time - as advertised (but depending on actual use). The buttons on the keyboard are soft, precise and fairly quiet. The mouse controls feel very precise as well. The clicks are short and distinct and the scroll wheel feels smooth. There is an LED light on both the keyboard and the mouse that warns you when the batteries need replacement - very handy. The keyboard has an adjustable tilt by moving the rubberized feet. You can also stand it on it&rsquo;s side and let it stand at a 90-degree angle to give you more desktop space. The keyboard also seems to be spill-proof as it is has a few slots on the bottom for the liquid to drain through (see pictures). Range: I sometimes use this set with my TV while the PC (connected via long HDMI cable) they&rsquo;re connected to is in a room about 15 feet away and works without interruptions. Overall, a great set and a good price that lasts and is backed by a good brand! Go Logitech!</p>

<h5 id="armchair-omnipotence">Armchair omnipotence</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use my Logitec wireless keyboards even in installations where conventional keyboards were adequately serving the purpose. One doesn&rsquo;t realize what a nuisance keyboard and mouse cables were until one finally goes wireless. These units connected immediately to everything: Windows desktops and laptops, Linux desktops, and Windows tablets. One of our applications uses a Windows 10 tablet connected to a 60&rdquo; TV. The tablet is beside the TV and is controlled by a Logitec wireless keyboard/mouse combo from across the room. With a tap on the TV remote, my daughter&rsquo;s family can switch from cable tv to big screen computer. Their living room has become a theater for viewing movies, Facebook sites, and emailed photos. It can also be an on-line classroom for their homeschoolers. Family Movie Night, thought to have been killed off by the advent of portable viewing devices, is alive and thriving in my daughter&rsquo;s nine-member household, thanks in large part to the versatility enabled by a $140 tablet and a $35 wireless keyboard. Money well spent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This traditional rectangular keyboard works fine.Purchased to replace my Microsoft 1000 wireless keyboard and mouse.The 1000 getting old and one key I had to push down hard for it to work.I wish that I had purchased the upgraded (for me) Microsoft 2000 or 3000.Here&rsquo;s the difference:This Logistech wireless keyboard has a textured finish. All surfaces including keys. Some may like this. But the Microsoft 1000 had a smooth finish on keys which I like and I am used to.This Logitech keyboard is quite loud compared to the Microsoft keyboard.This Logitech MK520 works fine. And I will keep it.Next time though, I&rsquo;ll stick with the Microsoft wireless keyboard.I did not use the included wireless Logitech mouse. I kept the Microsoft 1000 wireless mouse. I prefer the Microsoft wireless mouse. Yes, I am now using up 2 USB ports - one for the Logitech keyboard and one for the older Microsoft wireless mouse.</p>

<h5 id="love-the-keyboard">Love the keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the keyboard, kind of hate the mouse&hellip;Legitimate question&hellip; Who at Logitech decided that this mouse/keyboard combo should have a mouse with a wheel that spun with resistance, had &ldquo;stops&rdquo; (for lack of a better word) that you had to bump over while trying to scroll smoothly, and made a whirring/clunking noise while scrolling? Is this some kind of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; on something that already worked just fine?I am tempted to send it back as defective but I am pretty sure that what I find unpleasant is a design feature, and I LOVE this keyboard. For now I&rsquo;ll use another USB port for a less aggravating wireless mouse but it seems a shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-like-having-to-buy-a-new-mouse-after-less-than">I don&rsquo;t like having to buy a new mouse after less than &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This combo has the M310 mouse. After 11 months of reliability, suddenly the mouse started double clicking on a single click. Changing to new battery didn&rsquo;t help. Unplugging receiver didn&rsquo;t help. Removing battery, leaving switch on and holding the buttons down to let the capacitors drain didn&rsquo;t work. Changing mouse settings didn&rsquo;t help (why would one need to do this when they haven&rsquo;t changed since the mouse was purchased) .Since I use this computer for work, I can&rsquo;t make inadvertent mistakes, so I had to remove the mouse and use an old one.I don&rsquo;t like having to buy a new mouse after less than one year. But since I need it to work with the universal receiver I have no choice but to buy another, reluctantly.My Toshiba wireless PA3844U-1EKG for my laptop is at least 5 years old and has never had a double click problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="weak-receiver-poor-connection">Weak receiver, poor connection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While the physical keyboard and mouse are fine, it&rsquo;s the wireless receiver that merits such a low rating here. I have the little bluetooth dongle plugged in to the front of my PC, using it within a distance of about 4-5 feet at most. It&rsquo;s a constant struggle to maintain connection between the mouse/keyboard and the receiver. When the connection breaks, it buffers all of my keystrokes and then spits them all out once the connection resumes. I usually have to pick up the keyboard and move it around to get it to reconnect. Needless to say, this is not a tolerable method of interfacing with a computer.*UPDATE*After getting fed up with this keyboard/mouse and its connectivity issues, I swapped it out with my other (much older) Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combo, and put this combo on my other computer. In its new setting, the K520 performs much better because the receiver is positioned on my desktop (into a USB A/B box next to my monitor). Since the receiver now has direct line-of-sight to my keyboard and mouse, I no longer have connectivity issues. There also must be some 2.4GHz interference in the other location, because this keyboard/mouse was a total disaster there. But here on this computer it&rsquo;s actually behaving very well.I added an additional star to my previous rating, but no more because it shouldn&rsquo;t matter that much whether the receiver is positioned at your ankles or on a desktop. If the receiver is that directional, then it still needs some design work.</p>
