<h5 id="save-yourself-the-research-and-just-buy-this-flash-drive">Save yourself the research and just buy this flash drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I literally researched every single lightning-to-USB 3.0 128GB flash drive on Amazon. Not kidding - every single one. It took me three days. I bought this one and the HooToo drive (I also considered iKlips, iXpand and Leef, but those are just too expensive for the 128GB). I returned the HooToo drive the same day I received it, after I realized I couldn&rsquo;t change the formatting from FAT32 to exFAT, which means I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to upload files over 4GB in size. I&rsquo;m using this flash drive exclusively to store and watch movies on long trips, when I may not have internet access. Do yourself a favor and just buy this one. It&rsquo;s fantastic, and the price is excellent. It works just like it should, the app is much better than the apps for the other drives I tried, and the movie-watching experience is perfect. It even supports subtitles! It comes formatted exFAT, so you can upload files of any size, for reading on any device. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I&rsquo;m probably buying another one.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-bit-of-kit">Very nice bit of kit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice and aesthetically pleasing product that is apple MFI certified!The product came in a see through packet zipper. Once you take the product out of the zipper it is secured onto cardboard with the brad name and functions of the product printed on the cardboard. The device itself is enclosed in plastic and can be seen through the packaging, and you simply pop it out. The product also comes with a micro USB attachment that can be attached to the USB end of the device to make it compatible with Samsung devices also.The product is very Lightweight and has a slick and stylish design much like apple products itself. Cannot fault how this product is made and looks very expensive and has very good build quality.When I plugged it into my iPhone or Ipad PRO for the first time, my iPhone pops up a dialog to guide me to install an app from App Store named Pendrive iFlash Pro, with a prompt &lsquo;for this accessory&rsquo;. Once you open up the app you are welcomed with many features such as link to Dropbox\Google Drive\Facebook\Instagram etc., Backup iPhone Contacts &amp; Calendar to flash drive.The product is PLUG AND PLAY once the app is installed and any items you have added to the drive can be read or played by the app.An amazing feature of this product is that is has a Lock iFlash via fingerprints and /or password feature. This allows me to keep my files secure and private and prevent others from using my drive.This drive allows you to have further storage on your mobile or tablet on the go! Often you are limited of onboard storage and cloud services that can cost a lot of money, with this device you can have a 2 in 1 product to use as a normal USB drive as well as the extra storage you may need to play on your apple devices. I sue the product to store photos and stream music/video using the iFlash&rsquo;s additional storage as well as drag a few movies onto it so I can play them on my IPAD PRO on the plane when travelling.You can Freely upload and download data in between the onboard storage ,iFlash drive and cloud drivesFINALLY and MOST IMPORTANTLY the product is apple MFI CERTIFIED! I had a look at many other similar products like this on Amazon that were a little cheaper but were not MFI certified. With this product you have the piece of mind that you are buying a quality product for a VERY reasonable price.</p>

<h5 id="an-i-drive-that-actually-works-as-stated">An i-drive that actually works as stated</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m forever running out of room on my phone&rsquo;s memory (16gb) because I have so many photos on there and I rarely remember to sync them over to my laptop so when I saw the Addon Flash Drive, I ordered it as, providing it lived up to the spec, it could save me a lot of aggro. It arrived the following day in a small yet well presented pack and, on opening, I found the drive along with the instructions needed to get started.Initial impressions were good - the unit is compact and easy to stick in a pocket or bag without it taking up masse of room and has a durable feel to it instead of fragile as some memory sticks can be. There&rsquo;s a very tight fitting cap at either end to protect the UBS and lightning connectors and these are simply removed. The aesthetics of the drive is akin to Apple with the brushed silver appearance and the quality appears like a premium product. It feels durable enough that if dropped, I imagine it would easily survive the fall without damage.On to using it - I&rsquo;ve found in the past that instructions can be really hit and miss and the majority these days require a degree in Chinese but the Addon&rsquo;s are clearly written in English and easy to follow. You simply need download the free app from the App Store and that&rsquo;s it, away you go. Plug the drive into your device using the lightning connector and you can literally transfer files to it and you can move multiple files at a time as opposed one by one, saving lots of fiddling about. When it comes to moving the files, the drive worked just as easily on my Macbook Air which for me was a serious relief. I have had an iPhone drive before, albeit not a certified one and although it worked on my phone, when it came to the Macbook, it just wouldn&rsquo;t see the drive so I ended up with a drive full of data that I couldn&rsquo;t use so I was a bit sceptical over the Addon but I needn&rsquo;t have worried. Definitely a quality, 5 star product in my opinion.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-expand-your-memory">Easy to use! Expand your memory!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have a 16GB iPhone 6 so storage is at an absolute premium. OOPS. Not even close. I am constantly running out of space because of taking pictures and videos, mainly because of Snapchat! A lot of times I have had to miss out on saving a particularly good one because there is no space to save it on my phone. I have often had to delete pictures or music from my phone as well because I had just filled it up.I was looking for something that would allow me to expand my onboard storage, and when I came across this I knew I had to try it. The device is small, with a lightning (iPhone) connector on one side and a regular USB port on the other. It&rsquo;s really nice to be able to transfer files to my phone by simply plugging this in the Computer&rsquo;s USB port, rather than having to dig out and carry around a lightning cable. This device allows me to plug it directly into my iPhone with the lighting connector and download any photos or videos to it using the very easy to use free software from the Apple App Store. Then I can plug the standard sized USB Port end into my Macbook Pro laptop and save the files there &ndash; with no need for any software! Everything is great!&rdquo;</p>
