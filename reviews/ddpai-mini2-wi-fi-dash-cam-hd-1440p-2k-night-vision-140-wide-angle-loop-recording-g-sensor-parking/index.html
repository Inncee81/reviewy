<h5 id="brilliant-dash-cam-no-need-wire-to-have-park-monitor-for-some-vehicles-have-hot-cigar-lighters-when-car-is-off">Brilliant dash cam, no need wire to have park monitor for some vehicles have hot cigar lighters when car is off. </h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is really easy to use once you get the hang of it! I only have one negative point to add which is that it didn&rsquo;t come with an instruction manual on how to use the DDPai application on your iPhone. However I wrote to the seller and now that I understand how it all works I think this camera is brilliant, really smart park monitor, you can literally just wire it in to your car battery and forget about it. in additon, even no need wire at all for some vehicles have hot cigar lighters when the car is off, DDPai APP can set auto shutdown(standby) time and automatically wake up when G-sensor is triggered. No fiddling around with the sd card - removing it to plug into a computer to download, watch footage and re formatting it every so often- as I have had to do with my old dash cam. I love the fact that I can do it all on my iPhone.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-dash-cam">Excellent dash cam!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only had it for several days so far so can&rsquo;t rate it very well on how it performs.. . But it&rsquo;s a nice looking bit of kit. Not cheap and nasty looking!Operating instructions are straight forward and the menu and set up only takes a few minutes get to grips with being easy to understand. I have a 64gb card( formatted firstly ) installed and this works perfectly. I had it set to my preferences in just a couple of minutes&hellip;. The cam turns on and off with the ignition, Perfect!!Heading out for a quick little test drive I was happily surprised by the video quality of the camera, being very crisp and clear. Overall this is really easy to set up and to use and is great value for the money!!</p>

<h5 id="very-small-easy-to-use">Very small easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will suggest everyone buy this stuff, very helpful when u get accident. Very small easy to use!</p>

<h5 id="poor-quality-really-720p-at-best-poor-night-bison">poor quality, really 720p at best, poor night bison</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is extremely extrapolated. the real resolution is not higher than 720p. records at night terribly. packaging is rich, the device looks good. should be &lt;= $50.Z-EDGE S2 Dash Cam is 1080 p, but like 4k comparing to this camera.Delivered Aug 28, 2017</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product and just what I was looking for! I was extremely happy with the quality and how easy it is to use the product.</p>

<h5 id="wifi-dashcam-uses-your-phone-as-the-screen-so-much-easier-to-view-footage-and-share">Wifi Dashcam uses your phone as the screen, so much easier to view footage and share.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this wifi dashcam as I was fed up with having to take out the micro sd card and find the card reader to view any footage from my old one. To be honest the screens are tiny and only really used for initial setup.This wifi camera is brilliant, there is no screen, everything is done with the app on your phone.It is stuck with a 3M sticky pad, with a spare in the box.The micro sd card fits in the side as does the charging cable.The 12v charger has two outputs 1A and a 2.1A USB so you can still charge your phone while the Dashcam is powered.I downloaded the app to my phone and had it set up quickly and connected to the Dashcam wifi.I formatted the micro sd card, it is important to use a class 10 card. This has the write speeds need to record full HD 1440p.The picture quality is very good due to the CMOS image sensor combined with F1.8 aperture. The 1440p video is smooth.The camera can be rotated 330° which makes it very versatile and with no screen it can be tucked up out of sight behind the rear view mirror.Tip≈≈≈ point the camera downwards to reduce glare from the sun. It&rsquo;s better to catch a bit of dash and less sky for a better image.I liked how it could be screen mounted as the camera can rotate!Another neat feature is you can use snapshot button or phone app to capture photos/10s videos, which can be easily shared over social media!I am really happy with this dashcam picture quality and the ease of setup.</p>

<h5 id="windshield-glare-failed-to-catch-hit-and-run">Windshield glare failed to catch hit-and-run.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> RECOMMEND: Yes! Absolutely. Great value and quality for the money.I live work in Saudi Arabia. Quite possibly the most reckless drivers in the world. I bought this camera to capture the insanity.Well, my car finally got sideswiped today. I clicked the panic button the moment I got hit&hellip; reviewed the recording&hellip; and to my dismay, the camera failed to capture the details of the vehicle that damaged my driver side mirror. I discovered that the lens camera is susceptible to your windshield glare. (Look at the pictures that other reviewers have posted. No one is spared.)*** EDITED ***FROM THE MANUFACTURE:Initially, I posted a 3-star review. Within the hour, a representative contacted me. The representative apologized and acknowledged the issue. They also mentioned that there is a fix for this issue and will be available soon.I was throughly impressed by the supplier and their customer support. It is truly unmatched. For that, I changed my 3-star rating to a 5-star.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera">Great Camera</h5>
