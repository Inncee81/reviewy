<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-bundle-but-you-will-still-need-another-micro-sd-card">Good bundle but you will still need another Micro SD card.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess I should have believed the reviews about the SD card. It would not install with the image that was preloaded. On the first attempt to install a new version of an OS, the image flash failed and the card was instantly corrupted. I spent too many hours trying everything that I could find to try to format the card, but it was just faulty from the get-go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-the-startup-guide-was-easy-to-follow">and the startup guide was easy to follow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything advertised was in the box, and the startup guide was easy to follow. Only minor quibble is that the box was closed, but not secured with tape.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-of-many-uses">One of many uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to make a Pi-Hole. Didn&rsquo;t take long to get set up in my system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="skip-the-bundle-find-your-own-parts">Skip the bundle, find your own parts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To be fair, the Raspberry Pi itself seems to work fine, but several other pieces of this kit were busted. When first starting things up, I was running into mysterious errors. It turned out that the SD card that came with the bundle was corrupt. I was able to use an SD card I already had to get things running. The heat sinks seem to work, but the thermal grease doesn&rsquo;t hold them in place, so they&rsquo;re prone to slide around, which is a real problem for such a lightweight system. There are no instructions on how to plug in the LED case light, and everything I could find showed that having the red and black wires connected prevent plugging it in to the recommended pins. I was able to find a combo that lights up when the system is powering on, but not while it&rsquo;s running. And after a week, the power supply failed and I had to figure out another alternative that could provide the recommended 2 - 2.5 A power.While I&rsquo;m enjoying using the Pi itself, I&rsquo;m disappointed with virtually every other aspect of this kit.</p>

<h5 id="novice-computer-guy-here-able-to-turn-rpi-into-media-center-and-retro-gaming-console-love-this-thing">Novice computer guy here able to turn RPi into media center and retro gaming console! Love this thing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my Raspberry Pi 3! If you are new to RPi and Linux like me, you may have some of a learning curve to deal with. But once I figured it out or found a detailed tutorial to help me, I was able to turn this into a Media Center running Kodi, a retro gaming console running Retropie and Emulation Station, as well as an open source desktop OS. It&rsquo;s been fun and a little frustrating learning how to program all of this and build it, but it&rsquo;s completely worth it now.This bundle came with everything I needed to get started (you may want to invest in a USB or wireless keyboard and mouse if you don&rsquo;t have one). My only 2 gripes about this bundle were the MicroSD card it came with and the card reader. The card reader is super cheap and came completely apart when I was removing it from me computer&rsquo;s USB slot at one point. The MicroSD stopped working after a few days of use. I contacted SJ Deals (the store that sold the bundle through Amazon) and they gave me a 20% refund to purchase a new card because they were out of 32GB microSD cards.Other than that, I have really enjoyed putting my RPi together and I enjoy using it. I love all of the possibilities this thing has to offer, too. I&rsquo;m excited to see what additions people come up with.</p>

<h5 id="this-kit-has-everything-you-need-to-get-started-with">This kit has everything you need to get started with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit has everything you need to get started with a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi 3 is extremely fast and has WiFi built in along with an Ethernet port and 4 USB ports. This kit uses a thermal heatsink compound and 2 heatsinks. Other kits I&rsquo;ve had use a peel and stick thermal tape to attach the heatsinks. This kit came with a preformatted 32 Gb Class 10 micro SD card with adapter. The micro SD card has NOOBS and Raspian already on the card so it is plug and play. The only thing missing is a keyboard and mouse. Pick up a mini wireless keyboard with touchpad and you&rsquo;ve got everything you need. I plan on using this as a media center and will install Kodi on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-kit-but-order-your-own-sd-card">Good kit, but order your own SD Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kit is good and as described. Lowered the rating for the bad SD card that I received. Would not install Raspbian either from what was on the card or by trying from my computer. System kept failing. Ended up buying a decent SD card and installing easily.</p>

<h5 id="recommend-to-all-people-who-love-a-great-gadget">Recommend to all people who love a great gadget</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>B06Y626CG1Having owned the previous model pi 2, I really have few qualms with this model. It comes with wifi on board you can practially use it out of the box, provided you have the necessary equipment (keyboard, mouse, hdmi-cable). It come with 32g sd card, hdmi cable, power supply.I did have some slight performance issues, which are probably due to my bad wi-fi.All in all you really get a lot.I can recommend this little computer to all people who love a great gadget, who want to teach their children and love tinkering themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-of-cheap-generic-sd-card-and-power-adapter">Beware of cheap generic sd card and power adapter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sd card and power adapter that came in this kit were waste of both time and money. Had to spend a lot of time just to figure out the problems were just due to the sub optimal&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dud-mini-sd-card">Dud mini SD card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The pi works, but the memory card they sent me is a dud. Any attempt to install onto it or check it on a Mac results in it failing about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the way through.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="rasp-pi-3-is-great-but-the-kit-could-definitely-be-better-with-a-reliable-sd-card">Rasp Pi 3 is great but the kit could definitely be better with a reliable SD card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The raspberry pi 3 in itself works great thus far. I am only giving this kit 3 stars. As others have indicated, the case doesn&rsquo;t seem all that well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-a-quality-sd-card">Get a quality SD Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The kit is nice, everything you need is included. Unfortunately, the SD Card is unbranded and I ran into some issues with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money-terrible-sd-cards">Don&rsquo;t waste your money, Terrible SD cards</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TERRIBLE SD cards. I have bought 8 of these kits, have only interacted with 5 of them so far. 2 completely useless SD cards, and 3 that required A LOT of formatting before they&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-rpi3-is-great-the-kit-is-not">The RPi3 is great, the kit is not</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The RPi3 in this kit works fine, just be wary of the accessories. The HDMI cable that came with this kit doesn&rsquo;t work, and the SD card seems to be OK but was having problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="came-with-a-dud-microsd-card">Came with a dud MicroSD card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SD card came with the Raspberry Pi 3 was a dud, feels like I paid 69 $ and still had to invest 40$ for a working MicroSD card&hellip;</p>
