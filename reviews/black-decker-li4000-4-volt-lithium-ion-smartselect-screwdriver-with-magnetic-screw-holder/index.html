Perfect for a range of household jobs, this compact, ergonomic driver delivers 70 inch/pounds of torque at 180 RPM for efficient, comfortable performance. Use it for furniture assembly, lighting projects, and a range of other projects, including shelf, towel bar, and cabinetry installation.
The LI4000 has two specialized features that prevent stripping by preventing overpowering of delicate fasteners. The first is a six-position clutch with visual indicators, and the second is Black &amp; Decker&rsquo;s exclusive SmartSelect technology, which allows for quick and easy torque selection. An added bonus, the LI4000 features a magnetic tip that prevents you from accidentally dropping screws.</p>

<p>Chock-Full of User-Friendly Features
The LI4000 also includes a forward/reverse switch with an easy-to-read indicator window and a built-in LED work light that provides visibility when working in low-light or enclosed areas.</p>

<p>For further convenience, a mountable charging base neatly holds accessory bits and an LED indicator makes it clear when it&rsquo;s time to recharge the battery.</p>

<p>Lithium-Ion Battery and Energy-Star Charger Provide Performance
The LI4000 is powered by an efficient, rechargeable 3.6-volt lithium-ion battery that holds its charge longer than traditional batteries to deliver reliable performance job after job.</p>

<p>The included battery charger is Energy-Star rated, which means it meets strict energy-efficiency guidelines set by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Department of Energy. Battery chargers with the Energy Start rating have the potential to save more than one billion kilowatt hours of energy per year and $100 million in related costs in the U.S. alone. Moreover, if every American used energy-efficient chargers, we could prevent the release of more than one million tons of greenhouse gases into our environment, which would be equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road each year.</p>

<p>Along with the Energy-Star rated battery charger and 11-piece accessory set, the LI4000 screwdriver is backed by a two-year warranty.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box

<h5 id="almost-a-great-tool-almost">ALMOST a great tool . . almost!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this two months ago to replace a Black &amp; Decker VersaPak screwdriver I have had for many years and have been using on a near daily basis for two years performing appliance repair. I was hopeful that it would perform as well as the 3.6 volt tool it replaced and at first it seemed to work as well. The torque was good and a charge would last about two working days however that has changed. I now barely get a day out of it and it seems to have lost power in general. So it is a bit disappointing that this screwdriver hasn&rsquo;t made it through two months without losing ground. Considering that most screws once broken loose are not hard on the driver and I am only speeding removal, I would have thought this driver would&rsquo;ve lasted longer. Neither tool was designed for professional use however even though I&rsquo;ve used it daily it&rsquo;s not run hard. The VP driver was ten years old on it&rsquo;s third battery set. I only bought this because I felt the VP driver was nearing the end of it&rsquo;s useful life however nowv the VP driver bails me out when this one dies. So, here&rsquo;s the pros &amp; cons on the LI4000:PROS:- Small &amp; fits tight spots- Good torque (when new)- Adjustable torque great to prevent stripping screws &amp; breaking plastic- Light helps in darker areas- Screw holder good for some applicationsCONS:- Battery life not what I&rsquo;d expect from lithium ion battery- Very poor charging cradle design. From day one I had to wiggle the tool on the charging base to get the light to come on and show it was charging. I&rsquo;ve cleaned the contacts with both rubbing alcohol and professional contact cleaner &amp; nothing helps.- When it runs out of charge you&rsquo;re dead in the water until you recharge unit. Changeable battery would have been better.All in all I&rsquo;d give it a higher rating if it wouldn&rsquo;t be running out of power so quickly. As one other review pointed out, maybe I just got a bad battery, so I&rsquo;m going to look into warranty replacement. If that&rsquo;s the case I&rsquo;ll update my review. Until then, all I can say to B-D is you ALMOST made a great tool. It&rsquo;s hard to believe my old VersaPak driver is still alive and kicking this things tail!UPDATE <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub>: OK, well the driver is still going strong and I figured out that I don&rsquo;t have a bad battery. It simply isn&rsquo;t always sitting well on the charger and even when the red light is on is not always charging. I give it one more star for still going strong but STILL think the drop-on charger is awful. So close to great B&amp;D &hellip;</p>

<p>For higher quality and heavier duty tools I usually would not pick Black &amp; Decker, but their quality has been improving and their innovation is frequently ahead of the other manfacturers, so I though I would try this new Lithium powered screw driver with a built in screw holder and led light because of its combined features. I must say I was very surprised to find a pocket sized driver with a variable clutch that has plenty of power to drive most screws with relative ease. The magnetic screw holder works very well and and even though it&rsquo;s plastic construction may not be up to the quality of the rest of the tool, I can understand that some flexibility in the plastic holder is necessary to accomodate different screw diameters. Overall I am impressed with all aspects of the tools operation except for the braking force of the motor which takes a little longer to stop than higher grade drivers. But this should not be a real problem for the average home project because the motor is not as strong as some other higher torque drivers and accordingly is less likely to strip a screw head as long as force is applied to the screw for the extra fraction of a second until the motor stops from use of the clutch or letting up on the trigger.I did not disassemble the drill to inspect its drive mechanism. I suspect the gears are made of a high strength polymer, and not steel, based upon the weight and the quite comfortable balance of the tool. All other parts of the tool, mostly a type of strong plastic) seem to be of high or higher quality one would expect a tool made for this purpose. Overall, subject to any long term problems which could surface, I am impressed with this driver and I think it is a perfect tool for one to have around the house to take on minor fixit or construstion projects. I am most pleased with the amount of power that it delivers with a 3.6 volt battery and its overall comfort and convenience given its reasonable cost. I am considering buying one for my wife for her occasional needs when I am not around and so I will know that mine is where I store it if she had a need for one. Keep it charged for use and I think you will be quite satisfied.Review update as of November 29, 2011: I have used this tool regularly for some time for around the house projects. I am not sure how I missed this weakness, but it is important enough to mention. The on/off/reverse switch does not permit gradual increases in speed by depressing the trigger gradually. Since the tool has an adjustable clutch, this may not be a significant weakness in the tool&rsquo;s performance. When you depress the trigger, it turns the tool power to full-on. There is no ability to start the tool and gradually increasing speed. If gradual speed control is important to you, you better be prepared to spend more for a tool with this feature.</p>

<p>UPDATE 09-02-2017: After 2 years of regular use, the tool no longer holds a charge. It slowly started losing its power after a year. It is a bit disappointing that this screwdriver is another disposable tool. I would have thought this driver would&rsquo;ve lasted longer. At the most, I used it twice a week*******************************************My wife saw this tool on QVC and brought it to my attention and I scoffed at it; letting her know it&rsquo;s a waste. Regardless, she found it at a better price on Amazon and purchased it. I have purposely held back for two years from writing a review for this product because I consider myself a good handyman. I thought a tool like this would be for novice, but I&rsquo;m wrong. It&rsquo;s not a drill or high performance tool of said caliber but for all intent and purposes (gulp), I dare say one of the most useful project tools I&rsquo;ve ownd. It&rsquo;s simply excellent for light jobs of all sorts from electrical outlets, mounting kitchen cabinet doors, installing shelves, etc.It surprisingly has a good torque and it&rsquo;s adjustable for various projects so as to not over tighten screws. The charge holds for months at a time and the grip is very comfortable and secure. The magnetic screw holder is at most OK but does not work well on smaller screws. It has 11 accessory bits that sit with the charger. The LED light is quite helpful for those hard to see placement of screws (especially at my age)Again, this tool doesn&rsquo;t replace a drill but is a wonderful added feature for those mounting projects around the house.My wife smiles when she sees me using it and reminds me with her smile, &ldquo;Never underestimate simplicity&rdquo;. I hope this review is helpful.</p>
