<h5 id="great-little-fan-buying-another-one-bc-it-s-so-awesome">Great little fan!!! Buying another one bc it&rsquo;s so awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Serious fan. Got to use on jogging stroller bc baby faces me so he doesn&rsquo;t get any breeze what so ever. It clips on very strongly and doesn&rsquo;t shift or fall off at all. It&rsquo;s pretty strong so I don&rsquo;t put it directly on his face. I am actually going to get one to put on my desk at work too bc it can either clip on or stand up. Awesome!!!PS. I was not given anything to give review. I can&rsquo;t stand that junk bc I never know if it&rsquo;s a legit product or they got it for free so they give good reviews. Ugh.</p>

<h5 id="seller-replaced-item-and-all-is-well-with-the-new-one">Seller replaced item and all is well with the new one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The usb port is pushed in too far to where the charging cable can&rsquo;t be used. I have a flashlight that has the same battery with a charger so I&rsquo;ll use that but this makes me think the quality is very bad.Edit: the seller contacted me and straightened out the problem by shipping a replacement quickly. It is working great. The fan seems to be a good deal as long as it holds up. Time will tell. Seller deserves 5 stars but I&rsquo;m hesistant to go 5 on the product just yet.</p>

<h5 id="hot-weather-buy-this-fan">Hot weather? Buy this fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little fan is amazing! It kept our four-month-old cool in her stroller on a very hot trip to Disney World. The cuter fan with the foam blades was useless after one day. We would clip this so it blew directly on her and it was a lifesaver. Without it the heat would have been very worrisome for an infant.You must remember to charge the battery overnight. We would also bring an external charger and keep it plugged in to its USB port. This way our baby was never without it&rsquo;s cooling circulation. I wish I had bought one for the older children, as well. Highly recommend this little workhorse.</p>

<h5 id="the-battery-wears-out-quickly-and-although-it-s-an-18650">The battery wears out quickly and although it&rsquo;s an 18650 &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery wears out quickly and although it&rsquo;s an 18650 configuration battery the positive terminal is flat rather than pushed out and I haven&rsquo;t tested a standard one to make sure it would work. I got these for portable fans when I sit out in the yard at a picnic table or when I&rsquo;m taking a dump (sorry). They work spectacularly well for that but you&rsquo;ll need to recharge them frequently. The description doesn&rsquo;t say so but they are variable speed (which is nice) except when you have them plugged in via a usb cable for recharging or just for power. In that case they are either on or off with on being a relatively slow speed. One thing I might complain about is you can&rsquo;t clean them properly without using a screwdriver and being careful not to lose the screws. Otherwise I&rsquo;d say these are a no lose proposition. If you&rsquo;re reading this you should go ahead and buy some of these.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is great! I use it on my daughter&rsquo;s stroller to help keep her cool when we are out jogging on hot days.It is quiet and moves a lot of air. It is also much lighter than our previous clip on fan.The rechargeable battery means that if it runs out of juice while we are out it isn&rsquo;t easy to get it going again (can&rsquo;t just pop into a drug store for fresh batteries) but because I have a lipstick charger it isn&rsquo;t a big problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-love-love">Love, love, love !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ahh ! Where do I begin? I had never heard of a stroller fan until we were at Disney World last year and I saw the most amazing invention .. these fans that were attachable to strollers !! We asked if they sold them at WDW but they were all sold out and of course we were there at the hottest time possible. So I vowed to make this purchase when I got home. Well, I forgot. But we&rsquo;re about to head there again and so I decided to purchase two of these for our BJCMDGT. We&rsquo;ve used it a bunch in the meantime, at Art and Wine festivals, at the park, at amusement parks, etc. and it&rsquo;s great ! When it&rsquo;s not attached to the stroller, we use it as little table fans.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-workout-fan">Great workout fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for my use - I bring it to the gym to keep me from overheating on the stationary bike or treadmill. Most machines allow this to clip on.I did notice the fan started to lose power near the end of a 1-hour workout, so I purchased a higher-capacity battery. That helped a lot, now even if I forget to charge it, it lasts the two hours on high and only loses a little power near the end.When plugged in to USB, it will only be on medium speed (or off). That&rsquo;s a little annoying, so I always run off of the internal battery then charge it after my workout.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quit-working">Quit working.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a negative review, I chose to have product replaced. Got the replacement, and have been happy with it so far. Not sure it is up to heavy use.Purchased this fan to use in golf cart. It clipped on the hand grip, and worked well for a couple rounds, then stopped working shortly after turning it on. I thought I had not charged it, but after a full charge, it started briefly, then quit. Might be the jarring of cart, but it is worthless now.</p>

<h5 id="it-runs-out-of-battery-too-quickly-you-cannot">It runs out of battery too quickly. You cannot &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It runs out of battery too quickly. You cannot use it for an extensive amount of time before it dies. Very disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-portability">Love the portability</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the portability, the clip and that it charges with a USB. We bought it to use for our newborn and have clipped it to her stroller/car seat and to the crib.</p>

<p>Horrible battery life. We bought these for our shave ice business to run more than an hour before dying!!</p>
