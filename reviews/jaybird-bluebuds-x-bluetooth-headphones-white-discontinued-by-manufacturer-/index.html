<h5 id="straight-to-the-point-get-these-but-purchase-different-tips">Straight to the point. Get these, but purchase different tips.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to keep this short. First, I&rsquo;m an engineer, so I know a few things about problem solving, how things work, how they&rsquo;re supposed to work, and philosophies of use. Second, I&rsquo;m a huge consumer. I spend ridiculous amounts of time and money to find the right tool for the job. It irks me when consumer items are not well thought out, and marketing techniques are straight lies. Consider those as my credentials to trust my review.I will not talk about speed of delivery, how items are packaged, or defective products. Things happen and that&rsquo;s unfortunate.The review:Get these&hellip;.if you&rsquo;re not convinced, get them anyway, however purchase these too: Comply T-500 Isolation Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pairs, Large).My review targets the active headphone market. I have a drawer full of disappointing active earplugs/headphones. Sure, some of them work for my use, but there is always something missing, or could have been better. So, continues the pursuit of the perfect set, and that I have found in the BlueBuds X. This is why:Bluetooth: no more struggling with long cords, short cords, getting caught in things, flapping around while you run&hellip;..put these on and you have complete freedom. Sure, bluetooth headphones aren&rsquo;t new, but these are not bulky and they don&rsquo;t have a big heavy battery.Audio: If you&rsquo;re concerned with bluetooth lossy quality, get over yourself. Stay home with your $1000 over the ear reference headphones. These are meant to go outside. I subscribe to pandora&rsquo;s premium service with higher quality audio and these sound fantastic. The sound stage is flat, but very well balanced. I prefer this. Bass is present and highs are clear. Bass heads, it&rsquo;s not all about bass. However, you must have a good fit to appreciate the terrific audio.Build Quality: They look amazing. Made of plastic. Cord is rubbery and tough, that&rsquo;s a good thing. Take care of them and they will last.ACTIVE USE: This is the most important part. I&rsquo;ve done other activities with these, such as cycling, and calisthenics, but I&rsquo;ll only reference running. It took a while to dial these in. I went from thinking these would contribute to the infamous drawer, but I kept at it. The first few runs I was determining which size plugs to use and which way I should wear them - there are two ways to wear these. I chose the over the ear style. Having chosen the best size plugs, they kept sliding out. They didn&rsquo;t fall off, but slid out so there wasn&rsquo;t a good seal, and the audio suffered. I was constantly pushing them back into my ear during the run. I tried cleaning my ears immediately before my runs, dampening the plugs just a bit as i&rsquo;ve read somewhere before, but they continued to slide out. I was disappointed at this point. I kept at it, because I wanted these to work as the previous points were really good. So, I purchased these &ldquo;Comply T-500 Isolation Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pairs, Large).&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t believe how well those plugs worked with the BlueBuds X. Jaybird should consider providing these plugs stock. I&rsquo;ve ran&hellip;many miles and they did not slip out once. From start to finish, no adjusting during the run; hot, sweaty, bumpy, windy, they stayed in place. I put these on and I forget about them, concentrated on my run. THE BEST, AND MY LAST, ACTIVE HEADPHONES.A little about the Comply tips. the T-500 will fit the headphones. It took a little pushing and mashing, but they did go on. Squeeze and roll them right before putting them into your ear, pull the top of your ear up then slide the plugs in and hold them in place while the foam expands.Gripes: These really don&rsquo;t matter, as the end result is me running with freedom and 100% satisfaction, it&rsquo;s more than that&hellip;I think love is a better word.Charge cord: I don&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s a little funky to use, but however you use it, it charges the headphones.Power plug: Non existent. I was surprised there wasn&rsquo;t a usb wall outlet, so I use my phone charger.Packaging: I know I said I wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it, but I do recall the headphones were a pain to get out of the box. Have scissors.Instruction booklet: lots of pictures, not enough words, difficult to set up the over the ear style, but set it and forget.Case: difficult to close the case with the charge cord and headphones, but mash it a few times and it&rsquo;ll close. There must be a hidden art to get it to fit.Beeping: There is a beep every time you change the volume. A little annoying, so don&rsquo;t change the volume often.Easter Egg: I don&rsquo;t recall if these are bluetooth 4.0, or if that&rsquo;s the cause, but on my iphone 5 there is a battery gauge for the headphones that pop up next to the bluetooth icon. A pleasant surprise!!!</p>

<h5 id="wow-just-wow">Wow. Just wow.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off: BUY THESENow, here&rsquo;s why. I&rsquo;ve tried so many BT headphones over the years that it&rsquo;s crazy how much time and money I&rsquo;ve spent. I read all the reviews for these BlueBuds here at Amazon and was convinced I needed to give BT headphones another shot. I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Here are my experiences.FitI&rsquo;m a 6&rsquo; male with a big head. My head is big, my ears are big. I sweat and super oily doing next to nothing. Fit has to be right, or they just go back in the box and I&rsquo;ll never use them again. Spend the time to find what works best for you. I spent at least 30 minutes trying on various ear tips and cushions. I tried under ear, and over ear. My recipe in the end was this: large tips, no cushions, and over ear. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like the over ear but when they were under my ears, they wouldn&rsquo;t stay secure. This also removed the need for using the cushions. I can put them on in a second and take them off in half a second. They stay secure. I can thrash my head, do somersaults, jumping jacks, and do pretty much anything and they will stay on my head. One final note on fitment: use the cord clips and dial them in to your comfort level. For me, I can fit 2 fingers between my head and cord. This allows me to move my head wherever I want and they won&rsquo;t pull out of my ears. Every now and then I&rsquo;ll accidentally tap or swipe the cord with my hands. The buds don&rsquo;t move&hellip; I can literally wear these all day and do whatever I want and they stay put. Wow.UsageDuring normal wear, I can barely tell that they are there. The cord doesn&rsquo;t bother my head, and the buds don&rsquo;t bother my ears. They are super comfortable.RemoteI initially thought that having the remote behind my ear would be hard to get to. It&rsquo;s not. The 3 buttons are easy to find and use. Everything works, too. Vol +/-, pause, Siri, etc. Everything works as expected. As other reviewers have noted, when you change the volume there&rsquo;s a beep and the music briefly stops while that beep plays out. Minor nit. For more info on Siri, see below.Sound Quality / All about the bassAnother reason why I didn&rsquo;t like the using the cushions: they prevented me from jamming the buds in my ear holes as much as I wanted. If they aren&rsquo;t in your ear canal far enough, you won&rsquo;t get the bass and everything will sound tinny. You will hate listening to music with them. With that being said, the way I have them configured, the sound quality is excellent. Great bass. Do they sound as good as my wired Bose QC15 headphones I use for my Mac? No. But they are damn good for general listening to music, working out, or just sitting on the sofa playing games on your phone. They sound just as good as the wired headphones that come with your iPhone, if not better&hellip; and they are more comfortable. In fact, as I sit here and write this review I&rsquo;m listening to iTunes radio through my iPhone and it just sounds fantastic. I can&rsquo;t believe how great these sound. Been wearing them for hours. Need more bass? Make sure they are stuck in your ear holes good. Try different ear tips and try again. Then you&rsquo;ll say&hellip; Wow.Bluetooth RangeZOMG! Really? How?? You&rsquo;re a wizard, Harry! This is freaking magic! I live in a 2 story, 5bdr home, with an overwhelming number of wireless devices and other things to cause plenty of interferences to challenge everything. Yet, with my iPhone or iPad sitting on my desk downstairs, I can walk anywhere in my home and the music just keeps playing. I have never in my life experienced Bluetooth range as good as these. This genuinely made me giddy. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to walk more than 30&rsquo; away and have these work. Truly impressive. On a side note, I have a 2010 Mac Pro with a upgraded Bluetooth card and it does not let me get very far, not like the iOS devices I own. I fault that Bluetooth card in my Mac, not these headphones.Bluetooth VersionThese have Bluetooth V2.1 + EDR. Compare that to the iPhone 6 which has V4. OMG how could they do this to us?! A whole 2+ versions different? It&rsquo;s got to suck, right? No, not at all. Those newer versions offer additional capabilities that have little to do with headphones. Don&rsquo;t be such a tech snob. You&rsquo;ll be just fine rocking your V2.1 Bluetoothbuds, bud.iPad Air 2 / iPhone 6 PlusAre you at least of caveman status? Then you&rsquo;ve got this nailed. Pairing was quick and simple. Your phone will show the battery level, and all the features of the remote work as expected. Again, I was blown away at the range of the BlueBuds and my iOS devices. Giddy. Wow.SiriTook me a second (literally) to figure out how to get Siri to work. Just press the middle button for a second. Ask Siri &ldquo;How much wood can a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?&rdquo; Then get back to your music. Even with the mic behind my ear, everything I&rsquo;ve asked Siri was understood clearly the first time. No need to shout. Just talk like a normal human&hellip; not a caveman.Call QualityThis is where things fall a little short, but it&rsquo;s not all that bad. Why did you buy these? To talk on the phone for hours and expect the best quality in the world? Surely you didn&rsquo;t. If you did, go find something else because the person on the other end of the line will appreciate it. Does the mic work? Yes. Just not that well. I left two VM calls on my business line. With the mic behind my ear, I could hear myself but it wasn&rsquo;t very good. I wouldn&rsquo;t torture anyone by calling them like this. For my 2nd test, I flipped the cord so that it was in front of my neck instead of behind it. Surprisingly this configuration worked as well. The mic was 10X better in this configuration, but still not that great. In a pinch, I would conduct a phone call this way, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be for very long. It sounds like you&rsquo;re talking on a poor Bluetooth headset. There are better options out there.SkypeJust for fun, I also tried Skype 7.7 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. As with other Bluetooth headphones, the quality was unusable. I blame my 2010 Mac Pro for this, and possibly Skype. I didn&rsquo;t try any newer Macs, though. With that being said, that&rsquo;s not why I bought these headphones, and not their fault I&rsquo;m trying to get a 5+ year old computer with old tech to work with them.Shipping + Marriage ProposalI love you, Amazon Prime. I really do. You are my secret love affair. Just don&rsquo;t tell my wife. You tell me to expect it in 2 days and then you get it to me the next day at no extra charge. Let&rsquo;s get married, baby, because you deliver like nobody else and you have everything I need. WATCHI don&rsquo;t have it yet, but will soon. I&rsquo;ll update accordingly. -Dick TracyBattery LifeIt came pre-charged at about 50% for me. I really haven&rsquo;t tested this out yet but all the reviews state it has excellent battery life. If I have any real-world experiences to share, I&rsquo;ll update my review. Until then, just imagine another glorious feature of this product talked about here.Product LifeYes, I just got it and it works. But will it in 6 months or a year? I&rsquo;ll let you know. As with any product that is this small and takes a beating, I don&rsquo;t expect it to last forever. A big part of product life has to do with how you care for it. Others are complaining about problems with it over time. But if someone just rips you off their head and jams you into their pocket or gym bag, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t last very long either.Included AccessoriesPackaging: Way overkill. It took me several minutes to get it out of the packaging. The presentation is excellent for retail, but who shops retail anymore? Is Best Buy still even in business? We buy from Amazon and as soon as that box shows up we rip the sucker out and want to get to the goods. This needs to have the Amazon hassle-free packaging touch. I&rsquo;d prefer the thing to just be rolled up in bubble wrap like a sushi roll with nothing more than a piece of tape or a rubber band holding it closed.Case: Really cool! It&rsquo;s a hard clamshell case and constructed very well with attention to detail and materials. For me, I&rsquo;ll probably never use it though&hellip; it&rsquo;s too bulky. I&rsquo;ll end up using one of my smaller solutions so it doesn&rsquo;t look like I&rsquo;m carrying a pack of chew in my back pocket.Micro USB Charging Cable: It&rsquo;s a very short cable and works as expected. Any similar micro USB cable will work just as well. There&rsquo;s no wall adapter included, however. For the price I would have expected that one be included, but seriously&hellip; I probably have an extra 6 laying around here, so this wasn&rsquo;t a problem for me at all. Charging these is easy&hellip; just pop the cover off the remote side and plug it in! 2+ hrs for full charge gives 8 hours of playtime. 30 mins charging gives 90 minutes of play time.Manual: The manual was very easy to understand with clear descriptions and illustrations. For me, it was too small and hard to read because of the size and the black paper. Thankfully, just about everything was straight forward and easy to understand. You can also download the manual from their website: <a href="http://www.jaybirdsport.com/static/media/uploads/support/pdf/Jaybird_BBX1_USER_MANUAL.pdf">http://www.jaybirdsport.com/static/media/uploads/support/pdf/Jaybird_BBX1_USER_MANUAL.pdf</a></p>
