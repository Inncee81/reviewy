<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-large-cd-player-slot-phone-with-a-thick-wallet-case">Great for large CD player slot &amp; phone with a thick wallet case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tried some other brands, but even after maximizing the adjustment of the tightening screw, those CD mounts just fell out. This Taotronics mount stays in, and the 3M rubber pads keep the fit snug in the large CD player slot.The silicon grips and flip-down base keep the phone in place. The mount base did not interfere when using the charging cable, but since the phone case is ~ 1.5&rdquo; thick, the cable did not need to go through the pass-through slot and was able to clear the bottom bar of the base without problems.Found the 360° rotatable ball joint seemed to provide more flexibility when the tightening knob was in the bottom position. Was able to pivot the phone with more range of motion which was helpful when using GPS. One-handed button to release the phone is extremely convenient.In addition, had a great experience with manufacturer, TaoTronics. Needed new rubber pads to replace the ones that got misaligned. Instead of just sending rubber pads, TaoTronics kindly sent a brand new unit at no additional charge. Such a pleasure to do business with a company that values high customer satisfaction.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-cd-mount-cell-phone-holder">Perfect CD mount cell phone holder!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After doing some research and reading tons of reviews, I settled on the TaoTronics cell phone holder and I&rsquo;m glad I did. For starters, you can&rsquo;t beat the price! It is perfect for my 2014 Ford Edge CD player, which is just below the touch/navigation screen and doesn&rsquo;t interfere with any of my controls and does not obstruct my back up camera. I used the optional pads for a more secure fit in the CD slot, adjusted the tension with the knob as instructed and it didn&rsquo;t move at all. The mechanics of the holder kept my phone secure and I can use it both horizontally or vertically. Super easy, one hand release.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-choice">Good choice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this for about a month and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. The quality is good, definitely doesn&rsquo;t look like it will be breaking or cracking any time soon, and the idea of attaching this to the CD player is great. I wanted to be able to see my phone as I drove, especially for navigation purposes, but the phone holders that you stick on the dashboard seemed too intrusive, and the ones that you stick on the vent too precariously held, based on the reviews I read of people who complained that their phones flew up in the air with every sharp turn. This is perfect, exactly what I was looking for, so far phone has stayed where it&rsquo;s supposed to through sharp turns, stops, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried a lot of cell phone car mounts that always end up failing after awhile. So far this one seems to work well in a 2008 Ford Escape. I didn&rsquo;t even notice it was TaoTronics brand when i purchased it. I also purchased a Bluetooth receiver for the aux jack of my Ford Escape from TaoTronics and it has been working great for a while now. Thanks!!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-product-good-resource-for-lyft-drivers">Excellent product, Good Resource for Lyft Drivers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a driver for Lyft, a hand&rsquo;s free phone holder is essential. I also need to be able to pull that phone off the holder quickly in case of route changes, messages, or breaks. The one-handed operation is very convenient and works great. I will rate the core features as follows:Ease of installation: 5 out of 5: Slid easily into the CD slotEase of use: 5 out of 5: Phone sits in the cradle and you push the sides in tightly. It holds it securelyMotion during drive: 4 out of 5: I drive a Jeep, so the ride is not smooth. The mount jostles when you go over bumps, but nothing comes loose. I tightened down the holder and the rotating ball in the back and it didn&rsquo;t move much.One Hand Use: 5 out of 5: Easy to remove and mount one-handed.Sight Level 5 out of 5: The mount in my Jeep sits just below eye level. This means passengers can see the route we are taking and I can glance over easily to see it as well.</p>

<h5 id="for-christmas-and-he-is-still-raving-about-how-great-it-is">&hellip; for Christmas and he is still raving about how great it is</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he is still raving about how great it is. He says it is very secure in the cd slot and he lives that he can rotate it towards him. He had tried all kinds if cd mounts to no avail (window, air vents, cup holder) but this one is a winner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was debating between this mount and one that attaches to the vent, very happy I went with this one. Phone is very sturdy in the holder and the mount doesn&rsquo;t move around. Took about 10 seconds to install.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-beautifully-and-at-a-can-t-beat-it-price">It works beautifully and at a can&rsquo;t-beat-it price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be too technical about this, but I am very pleased with how easy it was to install and use this car phone holder.It works effortlessly in my Volvo, seems quite stable, releases the phone easily at the touch of the side button and can be rotated in many directions for viewing by the driver and passengers.For the money, you can&rsquo;t do better.I&rsquo;m a fan!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-and-perfect-for-my-old-94-celica">Easy and perfect for my old 94 Celica :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, I tried the vent phone holders and they didn&rsquo;t work for my car or they pointed the vent at a certain angle and I couldn&rsquo;t move it. This fits my CD player.</p>

<h5 id="holds-phone-nicely-but-the-design-of-the-rubber-allows-you-to">holds phone nicely but the design of the rubber allows you to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid device. Not flimsy, holds phone nicely but the design of the rubber allows you to pop it in and pull it out, a feature I didn&rsquo;t know I needed until now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-will-be-glad-you-bought-it">You will be glad you bought it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a good purchase. I wanted a phone that didn&rsquo;t block the air vents or have to be stuck on the dash. I know they say leaves no residue, but I don&rsquo;t trust it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-awesome">this thing is awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>really well made for $6&hellip; all the functions are tight and positive&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t be more happy, does exactly what it says and what I need it to do.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-a-perfect-fit-for-our-new-car">It is a perfect fit for our new car</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a perfect fit for our new car. It stays in place, and will turn if needed. We liked it so much that we ordered another one for our other vehicle, and it works fine. .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great! Dash/windshield mounts tend to lose they&rsquo;re suction and this was a perfect alternative!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-way-to-hold-your-phone">BEST WAY TO HOLD YOUR PHONE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the CD mount. I was skeptical, but works great and is very convenient.</p>
