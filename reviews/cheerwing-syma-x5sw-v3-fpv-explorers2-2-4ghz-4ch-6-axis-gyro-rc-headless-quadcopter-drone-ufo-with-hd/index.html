<li>Headless/IOC function. Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using Headless/IOC, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction. This lessens the steepness of the learning curve and allows the pilot to enjoy flight while slowly learning each specific orientation of the quadcopter.</li>

<h5 id="quad-5-stars-because-of-the-durability-and-how-easy-it-is-to-work-on-replace-parts">&hellip; quad 5 stars because of the durability and how easy it is to work on/replace parts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave this quad 5 stars because of the durability and how easy it is to work on/replace parts. Parts are also extremely cheap. That being said let me explain that I didn&rsquo;t purchase this drone from Amazon, I actually saw it as someone was throwing it away in the apartment complex that I work at. He said that the &ldquo;motors burned out&rdquo; I see a lot of complaints about &ldquo;burned out motors&rdquo; and it makes me laugh because 1: the motors were not burned out, and 2: replacement motors are as cheap as $1.39 right here on Amazon.I charged the battery and then turned it on to see what was wrong with it and quickly realized that two of the blades weren&rsquo;t spinning with the others, so I took a closer look, removed one small screw and instantly saw that the gear from the motor was no longer aligned with the gear for the blade (picture 3) easily fixed by pressing down on the blade until the gears realigned. After doing this to both of the &ldquo;broken&rdquo; blades the quad took off effortlessly. Back in business! I think it&rsquo;s also important to say this is the first drone I have ever flown!I have wanted one for some time so I was very happy to find one that someone was throwing out. This quad is very easy to fly (after a few minutes of getting used to it) and to my surprise I could control it outside during snow and medium winds.The camera was better than expected and there is no delay whatsoever on the wifi transmission to my phone which is super important for flying when you can&rsquo;t see the drone. (Sometimes it takes a while for my phone to connect to the wifi of the camera though)It takes about two minutes and 16 small screws to take this drone apart and expose the circuit board and wires. I removed the two red LEDs and two green ones (picture 1) and replaced them with one single white spotlight in the front (picture 2) I did this by cutting the wires of the existing lights and attaching those to the white led, then I drilled an led sized hole in the frame and inserted the new light. Done! It was fun and easy to tinker with this and I plan to do more.Finally, I have crashed this quad into the snow, down several flights of stairs, into my car, my cat, trees, mailboxes, you name it I&rsquo;ve crashed into it several times and haven&rsquo;t even had to replace a blade yet. I am now ordering bigger batteries for this quad and going to get extra blades and motors for it because they are so cheap and I never want to be done flying this quad!Take it from someone who pulled this quad out of the trash. I did not spend a dime and therefore have no reason to lie or bend the truth. This copter is fun and for the price it is outstanding</p>

<h5 id="neat-little-quad-for-novices-love-it">Neat Little Quad for novices, LOVE IT.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little thing is so much FUN!! Easy to control in Low mode. For high mode, make sure you have plenty of room because this thing goes! Easy to pair with smart phone with the right app (get the Syma DRONE FPV+), not the greatest video but still good enough for almost any general purpose video. I have banged this thing into just about everything inside and outside of my house! It even got away from me in a gust of wind that blew it four or five streets away from me! It was a dot in the sky and I could still control it, not very well tho as a novice, but this thing has awesome range!! If I was a better pilot with it, I may have been able to get it back to my location, but another gust and it was gone.. I turned off the control power and grabbed my car keys. I was thinking, as impossible as it sounds, that I would drive around in the general direction it was last spotted and try to pick up the wifi signal to locate it. Well I did find it in the front yard of a home about 6 blocks away.. sitting in the grass, right side up and ready to fly! THIS THING IS TOUGH!!! After banging into everything at my house, it had just fallen from about 50 ft and worked like it was fresh out of the box! Nothing broken, I simply has to bent the soft plastic prop guards back out of the way of the props and I was ready to fly again! Indoors..Observations: Headless mode is ESSENTIAL for novice like myself..It got away from me because I was not sure how to activate it. However.. I noticed that if you spin it a lot or it gets banged into something resulting in a flip, the quad gets confused and readjusts itself in weird orientations.. Like the side between the red and green light might be front. I frequently have to land it, turn it off and pair with it again.. a pain in the rear if you are running video as well because you have to pair the phone also. Sometimes the control can correct the headless glitch with the procedures to reorient it..but not always. The quad loses quite a bit of battery power before the lights begin to flash. It&rsquo;s ok for light wind.. maybe 8 and below.. but near impossible in anything over 10 MPH. Don&rsquo;t try the flip indoors unless you have a vaulted ceiling.. 8ft is NOT ENOUGH&hellip; the quad goes up about a foot to perform its flip and then looses a bit of altitude during the flip and a little more to return to hovering. Doing this inside it will hit the ceiling, the floor or both.Tips:The quad comes with a 500mha battery&hellip; grab a pack of 1200mha batteries! They greatly increase the flying time, are cheap, and actually required NO modification to the battery compartment. They snugly slide in and out like a glove with no problems.when you notice that you have to go to full throttle to maintain altitude, the batteries are pretty low and the flashing lights indicator for low batteries are not far away. In this case you may want to consider bringing it close for battery swap.You can increase flight time, if you&rsquo;re not recording, by disconnecting the camera as it draws valuable power. You can also save a little (minuscule) weight by removing the camera altogether when not needed. As a novice, I found it better to remove the camera to have longer practice time flying. When I got comfortable with it, I added the camera back to the quad to start filming some flights.Syma has several apps for different drones and not all of them work with this one. The one that does work is the - DRONE FPV+I purchased a pack of multi colored replacement parts. It has prop guards, props and legs but with the way this little thing has held up so far, I doubt I will ever need to use them but they are good to have, just in case, and they&rsquo;re pretty cheaply priced.I LOVE THIS DRONE and I cant wait to get a bigger one!</p>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-awesome-and-here-s-why">this thing is awesome and here&rsquo;s why</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 12-yr old son bought this drone the first part of Nov with an Amazon gift card and I gotta say, this thing is awesome and here&rsquo;s why. On it&rsquo;s maiden voyage first weekend in Nov, he lifted it, the wind caught it and it went across the street and got stuck in a tree. Had to be 70-75&rsquo; in the air so there was no way we were getting it. After nearly 4 mos of being stuck in a tree in NE OH (which means cold, rain, snow, sleet &amp; wind), it fell out of the tree &hellip;&hellip; AND IT STILL WORKS! I thought for sure it was gonna be shot but no, he cleaned it up, charged the battery and it runs like a champ &hellip; camera too! Go figure &hellip; 5 stars just cause it survived 4 mos of a NE OH winter &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-for-first-timers">Great for first timers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband has always talked about owing a drone so when we came across this one we did a little research and found that this is a really good one for a &ldquo;first timer&rdquo;. Him and I were both pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to fly. He is like a little kid with this, it&rsquo;s almost funny to watch. It&rsquo;s only a 2mp camera but we have both been impressed with the videos it can take. There&rsquo;s no card for the camera so you have to use you phone. My husband uses his phone for everything so it&rsquo;s a really good thing. Connecting the phone to the quad is simple using the free app. called SYMA FPV. The quad appears to be plenty durable, but definitely not indestructible. The blade guards are a bit light and flexible, but seem to be adequate for the job. We did purchase extra batteries, which I highly recommend because with the camera it doesn&rsquo;t last very long so now my husband can have continuous flying fun while the others charge. My 13 yr old step son also fell in love with this quad so I can see there will probably be another one under the Christmas tree this year! Great buy for someone starting out with Drones!</p>
