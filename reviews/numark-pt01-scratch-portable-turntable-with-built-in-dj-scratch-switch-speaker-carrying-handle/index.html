<p>Step Out of the Booth and Into the World
It’s a new era for DJs! With Numark’s PT01 Scratch portable turntable, you can scratch and cut—anywhere. Built with Numark’s exclusive Adjustable Scratch Switch™, PT01 Scratch enables you to grab your favorite scratch record (not included) and perform any turntablist scratch routine, whether you have access to AC wall power or you’re outdoors with your friends.</p>

<p>Built For Any DJ
You can set up the PT01 Scratch for both right-handed or left-handed scratching: unscrew the scratch switch and adjust it to your style. Our scratch and slide switch performs longer than ordinary sliders, and since it’s user-replaceable, don’t feel the need to hold back, and perform the best you know how.</p>

<p>Serious Audio Ins and Outs
Connect your phone or any audio source to play a background beat through the 1/8” stereo input and scratch along to the beat. Increase the volume with the gain control and play it loud and strong on the built-in speaker or RCA audio outputs, or make use of the 1/4” and 1/8” headphone outputs for private listening.</p>

<p>You nailed that scratch session, but what if you want to hear it back? With the USB connection and included EZ Vinyl software, record your performances onto your computer and play it back whenever you’d like!</p>

<p>Portability at it’s Finest
Finally, PT01 Scratch plugs into a wall outlet (AC wall adapter included), but it also runs on batteries for the on-the-go DJ. it&rsquo;s enclosed in a hard case for protection as well and has a sleek red handle, so you can carry it anywhere and let the world be your DJ booth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Key Features
The PT01 Scratch is ready to use right out of the box with it’s pre-balanced tonearm. The cartridge is also user-replaceable, making needle replacements a breeze.
With the pitch knob on the PT01 Scratch, you can adjust the pitch by 10% or -10%.
Use any record in your collection since the PT01 Scratch is compatible with 33 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, 45, and 78 RPM records.
What about your 45 RPM records that need an adapter to properly stay on the platter? We’ve got you covered with the included 45 RPM adapter.
On the PT01 Scratch, adjust low and high frequencies, as well as audio output volumes, with the Tone and Audio knobs.
We consider the PT01 Scratch portable for a reason: With it’s built-in speaker, leave your cables at home and scratch on the go!
With the Scratch Switch, you can swiftly emulate the DJ technique of “cutting.”

<h5 id="you-can-buy-these-anywhere-but-you-need-to-buy-from-this-vendor">You can buy these anywhere, but you need to buy from this vendor!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The turntable is great! Quality is very nice for the low price. I have had a set of 1200&rsquo;s for almost 20yr and am a big fan, so this turntable had to stand up to that&hellip; Well it did!! Even better was the quick customer service though! I accidentally order another, and they quickly removed it with out 10-20 emails. Love the customer service!!</p>

<h5 id="great-portable-for-the-price-scratch-anywhere-and-still-have-gas-to-get-home">Great portable for the price. Scratch anywhere and still have gas to get home.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great portable turntable for the price.ProsSmall, light, and portable as it should be.You can scratch using 7&rdquo; vinyl or bigger but works bets with 7&rdquo; scratchy vinyl.Usb interface for recording vinyl if you really need to. Personally I would just go from the output into what ever recording device you&rsquo;re using.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, rca outputs.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> auxilary input and volume control to plug in any device like a phone and play yoru beats.Internal speaker if you don&rsquo;t have headphones or a portable speaker.Many mods out there to make this a beast. All parts can be modified pretty easily.You can use 6 D batteries or plug it in the wall. Personally I just did a rechargeable lithium ion battery mod. Lighter, rechargeable and even more portable.ConsThe small latch is prone to breaking because it&rsquo;s held by a small piece of plastic that latches on to the body. NEVER PICK it up by the cover. That was my mistake, I was just gonna move it from one end of the desk to the other and SNAP!.The stock fader it comes with acts more like a toggle switch. I prefer faders to slide like the kind you see on all the latest mixers.Audio can come out a little muffled at times even with the tone set to high.Platter can be a little wobbly for the heavy handed scratch but you can buy some stable bars for it and put underneath.In short, a great portable turntable for scratching for the price. All cons can be remedied by installing the many mods already out there in the market. I recommend this turntable for any scratch enthusiast.</p>

<h5 id="attention-all-scratch-djs-this-is-a-must-pick-up">Attention all Scratch DJs this is a Must Pick Up!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been djing and scratching for about 13 years and this is my first time using the Numark PT01 and I must say I love it! The fader response is just flawless and the sound is crisp. The needle and cartridge is really durable and effective.Even though it is a belt drive turntable the response is on point.*<strong><em>Definitely recommend for all those scratch enthusiasts</em></strong>OVERALL <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> Stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-it-s-not-a-1200-str8-150-etc-but-it-s-still-the-real-deal">No, it&rsquo;s not a 1200, STR8-150, etc. but it&rsquo;s still the real deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;ll probably want to upgrade from the scratch switch to a fader, and yes you may want to add some platter bars or a Skratch Steady ring for stability and maybe some other mods as well. But for $120 Numark did it&rsquo;s thing. I don&rsquo;t expect this to be equal to my STR8-150s but I can&rsquo;t pick one of those up on a whim and just practice some scratching anywhere in the house or pack it along on a trip or outing.Until somebody makes a 7-inch QFO this is the closest thing right now. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed. If you are, keep practicing.</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-a-must-have-for-djs-even-as-a-back-up-to-be-your-constant-player">Absolutely a must have for DJs even as a back up to be your constant player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like about this table from Numark!? There is so many things that I have already done with this and so many more to do! Look on my set up is really cool because I am able to put my Nexar between this and a Staten T 90 so I can use it as a standalone unit Or in conjunction with my other table all while leaving it hooked up and not having to move it around if I want to be a little more portable just unhook it from the mixer pop the top on it and away I go. I can constantly leave my stokyo kutter portable fader attached via Velcro to the deck of my PT-01 scratch!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job-for-125">Does the job for $125</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bang for the buck. This little guy will be a great expansion to my NS7-II. I&rsquo;ve Road tested it (literally) and while it does what it&rsquo;s supposed to - has issues staying in the groove. Typical for most of Numarks belt driven record players; however, I was expecting a bit more stability from something that&rsquo;s advertised as being portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-stop-portable-turntable-solution">One stop portable turntable solution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is hands down the most value for money portable turntable system solution ever! Delivery was immaculate and shipping was really fast for my order! The PT01 comes with a built in &lsquo;switch&rsquo; crossfader which can be unscrewed and turned around for &lsquo;hamster&rsquo; configuration. Plays 7&rdquo; 12&rdquo; vinyls with ease, and has 33, 45 and 78rpm speed settings. Also a neat little built in speaker too! Can be both power and battery operated for complete portability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great portable turntable, I use it for a portable scratch setup. If you plan on using it for the same reason, definitely go for the standard pt01.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-new">Not new</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This item was to be new but it the screws on the fader were misplaced and partialy stripped. It had been handled before. So I doubt it was new. It became unscrewed after light use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quick-delivery-amazing-product">Quick delivery, amazing product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>if you want to get into scratching, or have been out of the game for awhile and want to get back into it, this is perfection.</p>

<p>I love this table. I am a veteran turntablist and I use this more than my technics. I have done tons of mods to this turntable and the culture attached to this makes it even&hellip;</p>
