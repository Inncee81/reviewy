<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="in-my-opinion">In My Opinion&hellip;&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I paid full price for this &ldquo;tool&rdquo;, so my comments are not jaded by free or a much discounted price. The compass is about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; in diameter - you need the magnifying glass to read it - except that the magnifying glass is about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; in diameter-(placed right next to the compass) - okay for reading one letter at a time, if you have all day to read your OTC instructions. I had to get my pliers out in order to remove the tiny can opener. You probably will have some difficulty getting any leverage going to actually open any cans - I can see opening the cap on a beer bottle. You have half of a Phillips screw driver - will take twice as long to use, but it will get the job done eventually. Don&rsquo;t count on the &ldquo;cute little tweezers&rdquo; hanging onto anything for very long - they slide right off most anything you are trying to pick up. Ah, the toothpick - now there is something that might really work! The knife, which is why I purchased this little item, could have been designed a little better. It comes completely separate from the case, making it kind of difficult to cut anything much larger than bait for fishing. Better leverage could have been achieved by designing the knife so that it swings out of the case, remaining attached so that the case acts as a handle. Then again, just maybe the 10 in 1 that I received is not the GuardmanCard Knife that I ordered. It has no &ldquo;Guardman&rdquo; name or emblem on it. The box is written in (I assume) Japanese and I have to wonder if I was sent a &ldquo;substitute&rdquo;? Cannot recommend it for the money paid.</p>

<h5 id="multi-function-at-a-great-price">Multi-function at a Great Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the toughest pocket cards I&rsquo;ve had! Where others have had the plastic casing bent, broken and damaged, I&rsquo;ve had this one longer with nary a scratch! Everything clips into place and holds quite snug, even the bits you&rsquo;d expect to wear out after use such as the toothpick and tweasers.Its a decent size, but it is a bit fat and adds considerable bulk to my wallet, good things my wallet is expandable!The serrated blade is handy and pretty comfortable to hold, but needs sharpening straight out of the box for any tough cuts, and you may want to consider the same treatment for the can opener.It has many tool features in as small a space as you can manage, slots for small nuts and bolts on the blade of the knife, even a small screwdriver on the can opener!I use all of the hardware pieces quite often, and have even used the ruler edge in a pinch.The compass seems to be of a fair accuracy when lined up with a higher end compass, and the magnifying glass can definitely aid in starting a fire, though I&rsquo;ve mostly used it for scrawling designs into wood when I&rsquo;m bored.If I had one critique about this tool, aside from its bulk, its got to be the tweezers. Made from cheap plastic, I&rsquo;ve had a few occasions to try to make them work. The tips aren&rsquo;t small enough to grab at splinters, and there&rsquo;s no spring in the material at all, they just lay there like a dead, floppy fish. I&rsquo;d consider using some sort of tin replacements, you may even be able to fashion some yourself.All in all, I don&rsquo;t have enough good things to say about this multi tool, its handy in a pinch, would make an awesome gift for someone who craves utility in everything they own, and I&rsquo;ll be one person to carry this moderately priced thing around everywhere I go.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-okay">It&rsquo;s okay</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It definitely will fit in your wallet. The way I look at this is if I wanted a really good knife, magnifying glass, compass, ect I would have bought a nice knife, magnifying glass, compass ect. You can’t really expect greatness out of something that is supposed to fit in your wallet. The magnified glass is usable, but very small. The knife is usable, but very small and slightly hard to hold. The can opener is usable, but very small and hard to use, (are getting the theme). For the most part everything was usable if slightly hard to manipulate. The compass however is totally useless. Even with all the metal components removed it still wouldn’t budge, actually even with a strong magnet it wouldn’t budge. The tweezers are my other big complaint while serviceable they are really flimsy and I doubt will be of match use. Overall you definitely pay a premium for getting it all in your wallet, and in a word I would describe it as okay.</p>

<h5 id="too-bad-the-tweezers-aren-t-met-the-plastic-ones-don-t-make">Too bad the tweezers aren&rsquo;t met the plastic ones don&rsquo;t make &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too bad the tweezers aren&rsquo;t met the plastic ones don&rsquo;t make good tweezers they bend too easily. Also the card and parts itself look like molded plastic which means theirs some imperfections when mass production of said product happens. Also the knife is good, good not sharp like a pocket knife but I could open a hard to open blister pack easily with it kind of knife. I bought because compass knife and magnifying glass. Because direction, fire and backup knife the tool is OK but not great the tweezers suck would rather see a metal variant also toothpick is useless for me rather have 2 different kinds of tweezers both steel one a flat tweezer and the other a fat tweezer.</p>

<h5 id="a-cool-compact-tool-for-anyone-who-loves-the-outdoors">A cool, compact tool for anyone who loves the outdoors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband was more excited than I anticipated when I gave this to him.. We work on the pipeline together surveying and I like getting him nifty little things for work and surprising him with them&hellip; This was perfect. The compass was accurate when we compared it to another, it fit in his wallet, the knife is really neat and fun to handle. To be fair we haven&rsquo;t really used the knife for anything practical so I can&rsquo;t speak too much on how it handles. I can say I liked it enough to order a second one for a co- workers birthday. For the price you can&rsquo;t beat it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-just-ok">It&rsquo;s just ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it as a gift for adults. Feels rather cheap. The compass does not work and the magnifying glass is really small. The knife blade is nice and sharp though. Might be useful in a car or for camping. Will keep it because of the knife, but not impressed overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="be-prepared">BE PREPARED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already have the item in my wallet. It&rsquo;s a great little tool in case you run into a situation in which you need something done. Especially when it is so compact and not knowing it&rsquo;s even there. Great buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="golly-nifty-tool">Golly, NIFTY tool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a GREAT nifty tool for the avid hiker, camper etc&hellip; Still trying to figure out what all the nitches and natches are for&hellip;but GREAT quality tool.</p>
