Product Description
Sony SEL70200G 70-200mm Interchangeable Lens for Sony Alpha Cameras</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>FE 70-200mm F4 G OSS Full-frame E-mount Zoom Lens
The small size, versatile 35mm focal length, and outstanding overall performance of this Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* lens make it an ideal match for compact 35mm full frame format E-mount bodies. Although the optical design is state-of-the-art, this superb wide angle lens remains true to the original Sonnar concept with a bright F2.8 maximum aperture (“Sonne” means “sun” in German). Three double-sided aspherical elements minimize aberration so that stunning contrast and resolution are maintained right out to the image edges at all apertures. The renowned T* lens coating contributes to natural color reproduction as well.</p>

<p>Technology</p>

<p>Circular Aperture
When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This ‘bokeh’ effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. α lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.</p>

<p>Nano AR Coating
Effectively suppress reflections that can cause flare and ghosting with Sony’s original Nano AR Coating technology. This precisely defined regular nano-structure allows accurate light transmission, contributing to high-quality images, even more so than lenses with coatings that use an irregular nano-structure. The reflection suppression characteristic of the Nano AR Coating is superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings, providing a notable improvement in clarity, contrast, and overall image quality.</p>

<p>ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass
As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.</p>

<p>Aspherical lens elements
Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped “aspherical” elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.</p>

<p>Focus hold button
Once you’ve adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the camera’s custom settings.</p>

<p>Focus range limiter
This function allows you to set a limit on the focusing range which can save you time during AF operation as the lens will not ‘hunt’ through the entire focusing range. In macro lenses, this limit can be on either the near or far range (as pictured). In the SAL70200G, the limit is set on far ranges only. In the SAL300F28G, focusing can be limited either to a far range or to a range that you specify yourself.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Internal focusing
Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you’re using a polarizing filter.</p>

<p>Aluminum alloy lens barrel
Aluminum alloy is used in the construction of the G Lenses and other high-end lenses to ensure high optical performance. This material is lightweight, durable, and highly resistant to the effects of temperature change.</p>

<p>Lens-based optical image stabilization
Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.</p>

<p>Dust and Moisture Resistant
The dust and moisture resistance design makes this lens appropriate for heavy-duty outdoor use, especially when combined with a camera that employs weather resistant measures.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-perfect-travel-lens">it&rsquo;s perfect travel lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I came from the Canon side of the fence. I switched entirely to SONY from 7D and this lens is right up there with Canon L lenses. Image quality is pristine with a6000. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;only&rdquo; 200mm and &ldquo;only&rdquo; F4 but it&rsquo;s significantly smaller and lighter than Canon 100-400 and cheaper than 200mm F2.8, it&rsquo;s perfect travel lens. Two a6000 bodies, E PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS and this lens fit in a small carry-on personal bag along with a laptop and all accessories. I used to haul 7D with 100-400 and another lens in a backpack. Now I can carry two a6000 with lenses attached over my shoulder and it seems less bulky.The lens quality is very high with one silly exception: the sliders are too easy to slide. If you have the lens dangling from you shoulder it&rsquo;s enough to move the sliders randomly. It gets slightly annoying after a while and seems like a glaring design omission. I had to get into a habit of checking the sliders pretty much every time I raise the camera up or discover that AF was toggled to MF and/or IS was turned off. That&rsquo;s where one star gets deducted.The zoom and focus rings are silky smooth. Image stabilization works well, no problems with shooting flying birds or airplanes at 200mm. Unlike my old Canon 100-400L, this lens zoom is fully internal, the lens doesn&rsquo;t expand when zoomed and there is no lens creep, yay!I am not a pixel peeper. I&rsquo;m just a hobbyist who wants to strike a balance between cost, portability and image quality while hiking for hours. As far as I am concerned this lens produces stunning images with my a6000 that are better than what my 7D with 100-400L could do, sans the extra 200mm, but also sans the bulk. Combined with the fast a6000 focus this lens is a blast to use.The attached images are unedited, just exported from Lightroom with default settings.</p>

<h5 id="cheap-plastic-snapped-in-half">Cheap plastic snapped in half</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be overly negative. The lens works fine, but I&rsquo;ve really got to ding them for using such weak plastic to join the two halves together. Snapped in two like a graham cracker when it swing into my foot from the strap. Yes, I obviously need to be more careful, but for $1,500 I really need either a little durability or a better warranty. See my sad pics for a reminder to either be more careful, find a more durable brand, or buy an extended warranty. Edit: Sony&rsquo;s repair shop has now informed me that the lens is more expensive to repair than replace:(</p>

<h5 id="excellent-close-to-midrange-zoom">EXCELLENT CLOSE TO MIDRANGE ZOOM!</h5>

<p>If this lens isn&rsquo;t currently in your bag, DO NOT hesitate. This is a crystal clear powerhouse that makes the A7Rii that much better.</p>

<h5 id="good-sharp-lens-and-about-time">Good sharp lens, and about time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very solid, high-performance lens, very sharp, great stabilizer. Slightly heavier than I&rsquo;d hoped considering it&rsquo;s for a mirrorless, but learning to live with that. Seems almost identically sharp to my Canon 70-200 f4, and slightly smaller. Good included tripod mount, though sometimes a little awkward clamping it back on the barrel&ndash;nothing serious and will probably get easier once I understand where the resistance is coming from. Very happy with this lens&ndash;this and the 24-70, used interchangeably on a full frame (A7) and an A6000, gives me 24-300mm in two lenses that are both pro quality (even the 28-70 is fine if you don&rsquo;t need the extra width). Add a 10-18mm (already had that one&ndash;or spend another thou on the great new 16-35mm) and also a fixed, fast 28/f2 (or a 35, or the spectacular 55), and you have a full setup in a fairly compact package. The future is here, and it don&rsquo;t need no stinkin&rsquo; mirrors&hellip;although&hellip;I do also keep a Canon setup (6D and 70D), mainly for bird and wildlife images (400mm), macro (<sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8 IS&ndash;made easy with fully articulating 70D LCD), and 16-35 f/4 for landscapes, to supplement the 10-18 and at times to use with adapter on the Sony FF. But I&rsquo;ll be selling several of my Canon lenses, including the 70-200, 300, and 35, as wonderful as they are, because the Sonys cover all that while keeping weight down and allowing for legacy-lens use, like the great Pentax 50/f1.4 I just found the other day for $4.99 at Goodwill&hellip;wait&hellip;is this too much? Sorry. I do that sometimes. My wife&rsquo;s eyes have been known to glaze over. She tells me, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say everything you think.&rdquo; Probably true. But I hope this helped.</p>

<h5 id="pros-vs-cons-sony-fe-70-200mm-f4-g">PROS VS CONS&hellip;. Sony FE 70-200mm F4 G</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PROS:1. Optical image stabilization2. Dust and moisture resistant3. It has 9 rounded aperture blades for nice round bokeh.4. Lens only weighs 840 grams (which is lighter than most 70-200mm lenses that are comparable)5. Chromatic aberration is exceptionally low6. Peak sharpness is very good and one of the sharpest of its type (although keep in mind that results will vary throughout the zoom range)7. Has Focus Hold and Range Limiter Controls.8. Has ED &amp; Aspherical Elements9. Has Nano AR Coating10. Dual Linear Motor Autofocus SystemCONS:1. Filter size is 72mm (77mm would be preferred as most pro lenses use this size)2. It only has a max aperture of F4 which is a full stop slower than f2.8. (but the new Sony A7&rsquo;s are pretty good for high ISO, so this may help a little)3. Has slightly higher than expected pincushion at 200mm4. At 200mm, there is just some slight softening at the borders and corners.CONCLUSION:This lens is a must have if you&rsquo;re using a Sony system camera (like the A7 or A7r, or soon to come A7s). It&rsquo;s great value for the money. I wouldn&rsquo;t be deterred by the F4 aperture which will be the biggest drawback for most as high ISO performance has gotten so good with Sony, that it really helps curb this issue. Overall, I think most will find this lens to be a great addition.</p>
