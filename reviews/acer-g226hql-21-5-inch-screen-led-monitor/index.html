<h5 id="just-okay-budget-monitor-not-recommended-unless-the-features-are-what-you-need-in-your-budget">Just okay. Budget monitor, not recommended unless the features are what you need in your budget</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good budget monitor if you just need one to do normal things. However, if you need a monitor that can display blacks well, this is NOT the monitor you&rsquo;ll want. You&rsquo;ll be frustrated with Photoshop or Painter trying to see what you&rsquo;re working on with darker colors. The bottom of the panel is the worst area for light bleed. I ended up just using my old matte TFT flat screen monitor by Acer. My old one isn&rsquo;t true HD, but the overall quality of the image ends up better than with this one. To be completely, humbly honest, I would rather work with a big CRT monitor on my desk than this monitor&hellip;alas, space does not allow. It looks good sitting there though, and it&rsquo;s good enough for those who need a low cost monitor with DVI / VGA. However, I would NOT recommend it to anyone I know, and certainly not for those who need to get work done. Even typing in Word was unpleasant enough for me to actually notice it was more unpleasant than usual to be writing a paper!! However, response time is good, no ghosting that I&rsquo;ve noticed in my games and movies that I&rsquo;ve watched.Just adding here that now I have learned that the issue I have with this monitor is &ldquo;IPS glow&rdquo;. I was shopping for a new monitor at Frys when I just had to research why so many had a white glow that makes the screen hard to see. I ended buying a non-IPS HD panel and am much happier with it. It was also cheaper than this one was.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far, so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This does just what I needed - using it as a second screen for both my work (PC) laptop and personal (Mac) laptop. - I can alternate between computers using an input selection button on the monitor, and if one computer is not running, the monitor will auto select over to the running machine.The picture is clear and colorful, and it&rsquo;s a good size for both writing documents and doing Photoshop work. The only negatives I can think of would be the lack of HDMI connection and the inability to adjust the height. It is possible to tilt the monitor, though, which is helpful.All in all, for the price, this works great for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-monitor">Great monitor!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed an additional monitor for work so I spend some time comparing a number of different monitors. After many hours of comparisons I decided to purchase this acer monitor. It was the right price, the right size and had all of the features that I was looking for.The monitor came packaged nicely in a typical box that a monitor would come in. It had plenty of support so that it didn&rsquo;t break during shipping. It was very very easy to setup and only took a couple of minutes to get it up and running. It has a number of different adjustment features so that you can adjust the screen to your liking. The picture quality is great, nice and clear and easy to read. I am considering purchasing an additional monitor for work use as well and looking at buying this same monitor because it has worked so amazing for me. I would highly suggest this monitor for anyone in the market!!</p>

<h5 id="there-are-better-options-for-just-a-bit-more">There are better options for just a bit more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought the 21.5-inch model (G226HQL) to add a display to my early 2008 iMac. Works with the mini-DVI to DVI adapter. Unfortunately, the backlight bleed is just terrible. Viewing angle is such that if you aren&rsquo;t perfectly in the sweet spot, blacks will quickly turn to gray. It&rsquo;s so bad I&rsquo;m wondering if this is a defective monitor.Either way, it is being returned in favor of Acer&rsquo;s H226HQL. What a difference. Nice, inky blacks and crystal clear text. Viewing angle is fantastic. In fact, it is a significant improvement over the iMac&rsquo;s screen (which has aged well). If you can spare a bit extra, I very much recommend getting the H226HQL over the G226HQL. The only potential drawback is the H226HQL has a glossy screen. I&rsquo;m used to it (iMac is the same), but for those operating in bright spaces and viewing dark material, consider something else (though not the H226HQL&hellip;it&rsquo;s bad).</p>

<h5 id="doa-very-poorly-designed">DOA, Very Poorly Designed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived only partially functional. It would show the &ldquo;Energy Star&rdquo; logo when powered on, and then nothing. No display, nothing when you hit the function buttons on the bottom, nothing when you input a signal from a monitor to the DVI port.What really convinced me that this is a poorly made the monitor is that the function buttons are located on the bottom and are not labelled at all. They are just little black buttons with nothing on them. They are not described in the manual. Don&rsquo;t even know which button worked for what, and they did nothing when I pushed on them.Acer - why would you add a bunch of unlabelled black function buttons that aren&rsquo;t even described in the manuals? Why would you even ship a product that shows a complete lack of engineering oversight?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="acer-monitor">Acer Monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This monitor did quite well for the reason I bought it - easier to read sharper text for my old tired eyes. My previous one was a flat screen analogue (not wide screen). The wide screen here makes quite a difference. I&rsquo;m disappointed that I have to look at it square on to avoid a faded out look. I do find the simple up and down tilt quite adequate though. As others had said, it comes with full brightness. Turning it down turned out to be a problem, as all those little buttons underneath had me quite conflugerated. Tried to follow the instructions but finally got the brightness down to a reasonable level by hit and miss. That tiny instruction book is a joke - again for my eyes. But all in all I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the monitor. (Durn it - where did that cursor go again?)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-for-a-great-product">Great price for a great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Monitor especially for the price! I have had no problem with this monitor in fact I&rsquo;m planning on ordering a second one. I have it sitting next to an older monitor and it makes my old one unusable. The same with my laptop. I have no complaints it a fantastic deal on a great product.Decided to purchase a gaming monitor since i built a gaming PC. I went with the 144hz since it was recommended even though its pricier. Best decision i ever made. I played on my friends 60hz and it was horrible. If you&rsquo;re going to get one and you&rsquo;re worried about the price definitely get this one other companies charge for their name like benq. Great quality and best price for 144hz would strongly recommend!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased it I didn&rsquo;t notice it did not have HDMI, which today is standard on everything. Unfortunately the PC I built didn&rsquo;t have a DVI or VGA so I had to get a adapter.</p>
