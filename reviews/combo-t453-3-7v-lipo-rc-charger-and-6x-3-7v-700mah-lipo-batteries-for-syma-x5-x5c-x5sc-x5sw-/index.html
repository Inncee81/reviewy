<h5 id="i-m-supper-happy-i-would-never-believe-it">I&rsquo;m supper happy - I would never believe it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Those are much longer lasting than the original, and they also give my son&rsquo;s X5C much stronger lift and stability. They are fatter than the original so they need some help getting in, but do it once or twice and you&rsquo;ll be able to do it at ease (use brain to maneuver it, not force :-). I&rsquo;m supper happy - I would never believe it, but it feels almost like a different model.I am surprised that no one is actually making a longer battery (as opposed to fatter). There is still some space there to squeeze more, and the extra time really makes it so much more enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="weird-connection-issue-with-x5c-but-otherwise-fantastic">Weird connection issue with X5C but otherwise fantastic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries are great and power my Syma X5C just fine with about ten minute flights or so. For some reason, though, the stock battery for the X5C fit in the battery connection slot just fine and these did not. I had to wiggle them around and they would work until the first hard circuit and then come undone. I had to take apart the drone and take the battery plug out of it&rsquo;s slot and just let it hang in the battery bay. It fits the connector just fine now that I bypassed the slot. Wasn&rsquo;t super thrilled about taking it apart after only having it for a week but it was very simple. I thought it was an issue with the X5C but the default battery had no issue and it has the same plug so this leads me to believe these batteries are just slightly off or made of a softer plastic or something.Also the charger is impossibly small but works great. It stops charging when it has reached full power and an led on the charger indicates that. I have 6 batteries so this is an awesome way to keep flying your quad.All and all decent batteries other than connection issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="will-not-completely-charge">Will not completely charge.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, the batteries work, but I bought them because these were supposed to be upgrades to the X5C multi rotor. But after 5hrs on the charger it only flys for about half the time of the original battery. I only bought this product because I seen a great review on a different website stating that this brand and this peticular battery was a must have for this multi rotor ( SYMA X5C). Long story short. I get about 5 minutes of fly time on a battery rated at 200mah more than the original.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-amateur-running-a-syma-5xc">Happy amateur running a Syma 5XC</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy amateur running a Syma 5XC. I fly it almost exclusively with camera on and am averaging approximately 12 minutes of flight time per full charge on a single battery. Add it up, and you&rsquo;re looking at an hour with the entire pack. I couldn&rsquo;t recommend these Tenergy 700mAh enough!The charger is not super well built, but I&rsquo;ve taken care to only charge three batteries at once. I strongly urge any hobbyist to read up on lithium-polymer batteries; these are sensitive things that require care and attention.Very happy with the quality of the batteries. Would gladly buy them again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-batteries-are-awesome-i-bought-the-x5sw-drone">These batteries are awesome! I bought the X5SW drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries are awesome!I bought the X5SW drone, and the original battery did well while running around 10 minutes, but took at least an hour to charge. It was a bummer, cause its a lot of fun to fly but with only a short time the waiting got old. I bought this and charged up the 5 batteries in about 15 minutes - they may have already been partly charged. I flew my drone with them, and it flies AT LEAST 15 minutes! My buddy has the U818 drone and these batteries last as long as almost two of his. This is flying on high mode, with no prop guards. I also wasn&rsquo;t recording. I plugged the batteries in after the first flight and not 45 minutes later they were ready to go again. Its amazing and definitely recommended for the SYMA drones. I used a Samsung 6 EDGE charged into the wall and it seemed to work perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-purchase">Very happy with this purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>5 batteries and a charger for them all simultaneously. How can you go wrong? Using this for my Syma X5C Quadcopter. The batteries look identical to the one that came with the drone. PROTIP: Use a USB to AC adapter instead of plugging this into a root hub or computer. When I had it hooked into my hub, only 2 or 3 lights would come on. When I hooked the USB cable into an old USB to AC adapter I got with one of my old phones, all 5 lights came on right away. Very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-fix-syma-x5c-drone-keep-shopping">Does NOT fix SYMA X5C drone. Keep shopping!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not fit Syma X5C drone as described. As others have mentioned, this battery is a little bit thicker than original battery. But that was fine. It&rsquo;s just a little big snugger fit.However, the main issue was the little white plug that connects to the drone in the battery compartment was extremely loose and did not stay connected. So the drone would not operate at all with these replacement batteries.It&rsquo;s too bad because the charger seemed great and charged the batteries very quickly.I had to return and try another brand. Thank goodness for Amazon&rsquo;s awesome return policy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-accessory-for-the-x5c-1">Great accessory for the X5C-1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have about 6 charges through each of these batteries and everything is holding up well. As others have mentioned, you need to push the connectors into the charger a lot harder than you might think, but once they click into place they are secure. The charger does it&rsquo;s job well. I have it plugged into a 1A wall charger intended for a tablet. They definitely have a bit longer flight time in my X5C-1 than the OEM battery. I haven&rsquo;t timed it, but it seems to be a minute or more on average. They are a little snug in the battery compartment, but no modification is necessary to get them to fit. It actually keeps them from sliding around during flight, so kind of a bonus really. I highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="good-additon-to-your-drone">good additon to your drone</h5>

<p>Batteries work fine, get about 6 minutes from each one. Charger is somewhat questionable, sometimes all the ports don&rsquo;t seem to be working, but for the price you get what you pay&hellip;</p>
