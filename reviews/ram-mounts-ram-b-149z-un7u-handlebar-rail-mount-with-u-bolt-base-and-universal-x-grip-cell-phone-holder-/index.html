<p>Product Packaging:Standard Packaging
The RAM-B-149Z-UN7U consists of a zinc coated u-bolt base, double socket arm and universal X-Grip cradle. Included in this package is hardware that will accommodate rails from 0.50&rdquo; to 1.25&rdquo; in diameter. The base includes black cover caps to be placed over the exposed ends of the u-bolt. The mount is designed with a RAM 1&rdquo; diameter patented rubber ball and socket system that has adjustment points at both ends of the double socket arm; this allowing for almost infinite adjustment and perfect viewing angles. The included composite rail adapter can narrow the rail to a minimum width of 0.5&rdquo;. The included X-Grip cradle has a clean and clever four leg design that sports great holding power without hiding your phone behind foam pads and plastic. The spring loaded X-Grip cradle expands and contracts, allowing for a perfect custom fit of your cell phone. The perfect complement to the modern sleek interior of today&rsquo;s vehicles, the RAM X-Grip is the cell phone cradle evolved.</p>

<p>The X-Grip includes a device tether recommended for outdoor applications. The cradle is compatible with handheld devices that will fit the dimensions listed below. It is important to verify the dimensions of your handheld device with a case/sleeve/skin when determining the overall size.</p>

<p>Cradle Dimensions:
Minimum Width = 1.875&rdquo; (Minimum Height = 4.25&rdquo;)
Maximum Width = 3.25&rdquo; (Minimum Height = 2.25&rdquo;)
Depth = 0.875&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="ram-mount">Ram mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far it is performing well. Holds my phone(samsung s7 active) well though it does press the camera button or volume button, depending on positioning, in the mount. But that is not a problem as you can disable the camera button on my phone. The rubber band thingy that it brings is helpful as well. Even though my phone has yet to fall out of the grip. Only real issue that I have found with this product would be that the clamp area does not have some sort of maybe like a rubber or foam protection as to not scratch the paint on the handle bar. A solution that I used was duct tape. Yes, you read correct, duct tape. Took a couple small strips and placed them where the clamp would touch the handlebars. Works so far and has not caused any paint issues. Maybe some tape residue but that is easily cleanable. Other than that, it is a very good product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-and-most-secure-mount-for-your-phone">The best and most secure mount for your phone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The BEST phone mount out there! I&rsquo;ve always and only trusted RAM mounts on my motorcycle for holding my phone.My girlfriend came by the other day, with my phone in the mount, and told me how the phone wasn&rsquo;t secure and how sure she was the phone would fall out. She tried moving the phone around and pushing it out and it didn&rsquo;t even budge. She apologized and was thoroughly impressed.I&rsquo;m a customer for life!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-tether">No tether.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have said, the tether was not included (even though the product photos show one and the description clearly states that it is included). The x-grip holds my phone securely, the mount adjustments are good, and the mounting hardware is good. I like the fact they include rubber covers for the u-bolt threads. The minimal instructions suggest using super glue to secure the rubber tips, which I have done and they&rsquo;re not coming off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-worth-the-extra-buck">Great product, worth the extra buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought it for a motorcycle road trip this last summer, and after 10000mi, 4 months on the road, I can say that this product delivers big time. It is very comfortable to use, reliable and very well constructed. Grip on the phone is fantastic, and I never really had to use the back mesh rubber. I have ridden with it on paved roads the majority of the time, but every now and then I had to camp in the woods - riding a few miles on pretty rough and bumpy gravel trails, and it never failed - my phone was always secured and steady.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, definitely use the rubber strap to secure devices. Only issue is when fighting the handlebar nuts down you cannot use a socket due to it being to close to the post. Using a wrench scratches the post and nuts.Awesome otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-fits-note-5-gps-city-included-tether">Great product, fits Note 5, GPS City included tether</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just installed this product, but so far it&rsquo;s awesome. I bought it through GPS City as the seller, and it came with all parts including two sizes of bracket as well as the stretchy tether. It fits my Galaxy Note 5 with an Otterbox (Defender I think). No install instructions, but super simple installation. Just put the plastic spacer in the U-bracket and slip the mount on the bolts, then tighten down the locking nuts. Seems super well built and doesn&rsquo;t take much lateral space on a handle bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ram-mounts-have-been-berry-berry-good-to-me">Ram Mounts have been berry, berry good to me&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been satisfied with the Ram Mounting Systems for 2 years. I have multiple vehicles where I can implement a Ram base for each one and simply move the device mount from my mountain bike to multiple motorcycles. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, there is a Ram base for just about any situation to meet your mounting purposes.My main concern with this mounting combination was it&rsquo;s ability to hold my iPhone 5 during my mountain bike rides. I was able to traverse some fairly rocky and very bumpy trails without my phone moving at all. Of course I could not ever be compared to a Red Bull sponsored extreme rider&hellip;When I&rsquo;m not riding my mountain bike, I disconnect the mounting arm and X cradle and attach it for my motorcycles rides. The mount/cradle has been tested to 160mph without moving my iPhone 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="larger-u-bolt-used-and-works-great-i-used">Larger u bolt used and works great. I used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mounted this to Kangaroo golf caddie on handle bar. Very solid construction. Will hold iPhone 6 Plus out of its otter case. Too tight with it on. Larger u bolt used and works great. I used Lockyite</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good and durable product. Just took it on a 3000 mile plus motorcycle trip and had no issues with it. Worked flawlessly. I would definitely purchase it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great phone holder for motorcycles</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well">works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="orders-get-mixes-up">Orders get mixes up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it is a good item but i had to order the item twice because the fist time i ordered the phone mount i received as dog shock collar i was very comfused on how was to get this&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The rubber things came off and scratches my phone.. I need a replacement</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="game-changer-to-have-on-a-bike-just-don-t">Game changer to have on a bike. Just don&rsquo;t &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Game changer to have on a bike. Just don&rsquo;t get this version if you&rsquo;re mounting on a mirror. The U will stick up very far on a smaller diameter and limit movement of the clamp.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! Holds my iPhone 7 (with OtterBox) just fine. Tether is too small for phone with case, but you don&rsquo;t need to use it. I ride dual sport and my phone has never fallen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised, I have several ram mount items and like all of them. I use this item on my motorcycle and have never had an issue with it slipping or falling.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broken-phone-with-use">Broken phone with use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first time that my husband used this his cell phone fell off and shattered into pieces. The phone was in a case and secured according to the directions .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfect">works perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Holds up my phone well&hellip; galaxy s6. I just wish instructions came with it.</p>
