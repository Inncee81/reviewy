<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="96-orange-perfect-for-me">96&rdquo; Orange, perfect for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After losing my paddle, I ordered this paddle to finish out the season. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how well I&rsquo;d picked. Turns out I&rsquo;m very happy!It is massively long, which I love. It allows for the paddle blade to be fully submerged on each stroke, which eliminates the drag and wobble I find being common with asymmetrical blades. Paddling with it is a very natural feel, very stable feeling in the hands, very light. Easy to use with light feather paddling (such as maintaining place on the river for viewing fireworks -that&rsquo;s me-, or in finessing the last movements up to the dock) and also a very strong stoke for power/speed paddling. My 3 miles each way for fireworks was faster than ever before, on the first use! Also, with having to borrow paddles for the past week, I&rsquo;d developed some minor abrasion blisters, and I was amazed that with the foam grips this wasn&rsquo;t aggravated at all, no pain. The grips are very low profile smooth foam, and comfortable. The drip guards are well designed too, as flat circular guards rather than cups, which reduced the amount of dripping that landed on my head. The grip padding and drip cups usually would cost extra as add ons for a paddle, so this made it an extra good deal. I like that the 2 piece paddle has three positions, this is perfect for me because I&rsquo;ve never been good with the off-set designed paddles so the option to have it straight is really a necessity for me. With the 96&rdquo;, the pieces are too long for the width of a trunk when taken down, but I have a station wagon, so that&rsquo;s not any trouble. Also, they lay across the back seat comfortably, so that&rsquo;s another option. I did notice that the joint feels a little wobbly when first inserted, interestingly though once I was paddling it felt completely stable in my hands and I was able to paddle at full strength without feeling any give; seems it&rsquo;s just when I put my hands at the joint to test for proper insert, the beveled insert is not designed to be completely snug.Final word? Great paddle! I like it better than the one I&rsquo;d had for 11 years.</p>

<h5 id="great-price">Great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This paddle is one heck of a deal. The colors are fun, the snap in the center works well, feels solid, and has the option to be feathered depending on your paddle style. I got it on sale for about 30 bucks and at that price this paddle can not be beaten.*This product was NOT offered at a discounted price. I paid FULL price. I don’t give 4 or 5 stars for a product unless it performed as expected, and I don’t review items with limited information, just to satisfy the review requirement. I want people to know whether or not this product is useful. I will often comment on whether or not I feel the product is worth the full asking price, or if I would only purchase it at the discounted rate.

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this paddle.I am 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, fat and paddle a Stealth 14 which comes in at 31&rdquo; wide and I was using a 230 paddle but kept having to adjust my grip while paddling. The extra length of this paddle enables me to paddle without all the readjusting.I also like the foam grips, just wait until you are underway before trying to move them to the exact place you grip as it is much easier to move them while wet.No this is not some expensive, light weight carbon fiber racing paddle for touring all day long but if you are going fishing or just doing some exploring and are going to be doing some poking around with your paddle and want something that isn&rsquo;t going to snap in two give this one a try.Don&rsquo;t forget to put a leash on your paddle&hellip;If I do manage to break it I will update my review and how much usage I got out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-great">Work great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very satisfied so far. Have only used it 3 times but kayaked for hours with some rough water. But so far have no concerns about the quality. Length is good for our 30 and 31 inch wide sit on top kayaks. I am 5&rsquo;4&rdquo; and hubby is 5&rsquo;11&rdquo; and we both use the 96 inch comfortably. If you place the little rings properly you can avoid having water dribble on you but it takes a little time to adjust them so they work the best for that. Closer to the paddles seems to work best for me. A few inches from the end of each paddle. The bright orange is nice for visibility and mine did float in our hot tub. I do use a strap though since we use our kayak for fishing. When you are trolling you could have to put the paddle down quickly to grab your rod and reel. Would be most inconvenient to lose the paddle and have to use your hands to get to shore&hellip; The length does sometimes get in the way of my fishing lines but shorter is just uncomfortable for paddling long distances.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-paddle">Love this Paddle!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely love this paddle, finally invested and bought a kayak instead of always renting so I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to get. This breaks down so easily and is strong enough to use to push off of the shore if need be. Beautiful colors and light enough to wear my 5 year old can take a turn paddling and actually get us somewhere. not disappointed at all. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;1&rdquo; and everyone kept telling me I needed something shorter. not at all! glad I didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-paddle-for-the-price">Excellent paddle for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I waited to review this paddle until I had used it enough to form a solid opinion on its worth. So far I have used the paddle in several lakes and on at least ten trips down the river in my kayak. There are no problems so far and no signs of breakage. No stress cracks in the blades and the grips are holding up great. It has three positions where it locks together to set your paddles at an angle if you prefer, I&rsquo;ve always kept it straight. The little metal button that holds it together is still working just fine. As long as you clean it up and don&rsquo;t let it sit wet it should keep working. I&rsquo;ve seen some complaints about broken blades, I&rsquo;ve put this paddle through some pretty rough use and have yet to snap an end off of it. This is by no means a professional paddle, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to shoot any class 5 rapids with it, but for recreational paddling (fishing, lake use, flatwater) It does great and is well worth the price. Just don&rsquo;t expect it to hold your body weight trying to push off of rocks or the bank of the river.</p>

<p>I am 5&rsquo;4&rdquo;, but have a 30&rdquo; kayak, so make sure to order based on boat width and not necessarily your height.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-for-fishing-kayak">Great product for fishing kayak.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my fishing kayak. Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d hold up under the rigors of sport kayaking but I&rsquo;m happy tooling around on the lake. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; so I got the 96&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I love this paddle! I recently upgraded my kayak from inflatable to hard and this paddle makes my life so much easier.</p>
