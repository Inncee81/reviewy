<h5 id="they-are-great-their-main-problem-is-their-life-span">They are great. Their main problem is their life span.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used this type of air oven since 1996. They are great. The main problem with them is that they have a relatively short life. This oven replaces another oven of the same type but different brand. I had used the previous oven for 2 years, which is about the life of these things.I&rsquo;ll explain. These ovens work by using the halogen heat source and having a powerful fan moving the air all around and through every crevice of the food. The air movement is the key to cooking with these ovens. Manufactures advertise these things as being nearly sell-cleaning. All you need to do is add soapy water and turn it on with little or no heat. The fan blows the water around to clean the bowl, and the bowl gets cleaned. That part works fine.What they don&rsquo;t say is that grease gets on the hidden heating element and the fan also. This does not get cleaned. The grease builds up. You can take the safety grate off and attempt to clean the fan and the heating element, but you are not going to get it all. And after awhile, you will develop a problem with either the fan or the heating element, or both. Usually the heat source or the fan burns out. When my last one started to fill up with smoke. I think that the fan had quit working. I considered it a fire hazard and tossed it out. My last one was 2 years old. 1 to 2 years seems to be the average on these things.The heating elements can be replaced. But they cost about half of the cost of the machine, on average. I don’t know about the fan. But when you ad up the expenses, you are usually better off just replacing the machine when it finally gives out.You can purchase a 4 year warranty thru Amazon, which is probably a good idea since none of these units will last 4 years.OK. About this model.Normally you get a tall rack and a short rack for food. This allows you to cook different types of food at the same time, with the upper rack receiving the most heat. Grease from meat drops to the bottom and normally under the lower rack.This one did not come with 2 racks. Instead, it came with a single combination rack. Turn it one way, and it is a lower rack. Turn it the other way and it is an upper rack. If you are using it as an upper food rack, the food under it will be sitting on the glass bottom. Some people like this, and several ovens on Amazon are sold without any racks. Grease dripping from the top rack will soak into the food on the bottom, which adds a flavor that many people like. But personally, I like getting the grease out of my food, so I like 2 racks.Standard extension rings work fine with this oven. You can purchase extension rings, or even complete hardware kites to fit this oven here on Amazon. Any 12 quart hardware will work. There are special metal food plates that I would also advise that people to get.The metal racks and other hardware seems to be made from less metal that my previous attachments. The extra hardware that came with this oven does not seem as sturdy has my previous hardware. However, in my case, my previous attachments will work just fine with this oven.Like a microwave, this oven is not for all foods, even though you will see people claiming that it is.You will also see people claiming that it as fast as a microwave. It is not.But you will be able to take food out of a freezer and cook it in a short period of time, and food will have a better flavor then from a microwave. For most foods, you simply double the microwaves time.About foods with fat in them. The fat will drip out of them. I have cooked small whole turkeys in these ovens more than once. The food is healthier than from other ways of cooking.Things like potatoes will take as long in this oven as in a regular oven. But frozen French Fries are quick. They are also great and greaseless.There are ways to cook breads and bakery type items in this type of oven. Usually this requires making an aluminum tent over the food. The major problem with bakery type foods is that you are depending on it to raise. In this oven, you have a fan forcing everything down. I find things like this bake better in a conventional style oven.But if you want to take a steak or chicken out of the freezer and cook it right away, and still have a great flavor, this is the type of oven to use.As you can guess, I like these ovens. But I don’t consider any one brand better or worse then any other, although there are a few ovens on Amazon using different technologies. The technology in this oven is pretty standard, so I am pretty confident in it.I just got this new oven in today. Everything seems to be working.</p>

<p>This table top oven works great. I have used it about 5 times on very hot days and it does not heat up my kitchen much. I like the fact that it cooks in less time. I am still learning how to use it, but am very satisfied so far. I also purchased a cookbook to help me with some of the food preparation.</p>
