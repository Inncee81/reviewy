<h5 id="great-monitor-performance-to-it-s-peers">Great Monitor Performance = To It&rsquo;s Peers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was in a toss up between this and the BenQ. I decided on this simply because of price. I made the switch from gaming on a TV to a monitor and wow I should&rsquo;ve done this sooner. I&rsquo;ve had no issue with the monitor very easy to set up, use, and adjust to your tastes. I got it as a used item and Amazon did an amazing job of packaging this monitor to the point that I thought you could drop kick it and it&rsquo;d be okay. The sound quality I don&rsquo;t use everything goes through my headset so I can&rsquo;t speak to that portion. Images are clear and crisp even with all the new particle effects in today&rsquo;s games. I really love this monitor and the fact that I didn&rsquo;t have to shell out a ton of cash just sweetens the deal. I run this monitor to my Xboxone.</p>

<h5 id="nice-monitor-for-the-price-and-it-s-white">Nice monitor for the price and it&rsquo;s WHITE !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow Excellent monitor! I Bought this monitor for my daughters all white gaming rig. If you have been looking for a decent white monitor with a good price and 1ms response time Well this is pretty much it! I have been searching reading reviews for over two months and this monitor hit all the points I was looking for.Its super light I can&rsquo;t believe how light this monitor is. Would have no problem with vesa mounting multiple monitors.Windows 10 picked it right up no problems installing.For the Conszero at this timeProsIt&rsquo;s white!Colors are really good after some tweakingIt&rsquo;s ultra light I could throw this thing like a frisbee1 ms response time no blurOverclocked to 75hzNo noticeable light bleedingBuilt in 5 watt speakers decent (but not using)Stand is sturdy but still going to vesa mount itOver all I&rsquo;m extremely satisfied with the value and quality would most certainly buy again.Here are our color settings, we tried some other reviewers setting but came out dull and flat we like our monitors bright and popping like looking at a iPad.Splendid Scenery modeBlue light level 0Brightness 95Contrast 80Saturation 50Color temp user modeSkin tone naturalSmart view offSharpness 60Trace free 40ASCR offECO mode off</p>

<h5 id="great-monitors-for-the-price">Great monitors for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great monitors for the price. Was looking for a quick and good looking monitor and this delivered. I went ahead and bought two of them on a whim and am very glad I did. The colors are great. Only thing I would do differently is get a 144 Hz one to get them most out of my PC. I know a lot of people complain about the speakers but I wasn&rsquo;t looking for it so for me it was just an added bonus. Plus, I normally have my headphones in so there isn&rsquo;t much need for them. Great product overall</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The black color is not so black at all. I was trying to configure the colors until I found that the theater mode was the best setting for me. The other colors are bright and vivid. The speakers are a joke but for my use it does the job. I bought it to use it with old school games with retropie. I didn&rsquo;t notice that its only 60Hz but for $125 is a great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-however-needs-more-quality-control-during-packaging">Works great. However needs more quality control during packaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. However, a part of the plastic border was popped out leaving a rather large gap between the screen and the white border. Luckily it snapped back into place, but it shouldn&rsquo;t have arrived like that. If a customer wasn&rsquo;t brave enough to try pushing it into place, it would have been returned.I find the on-board speakers sound really cheap. My old macbook and previous HP laptop from 2010 give off better sound. But I&rsquo;m glad the option is there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-monitor">Great Monitor!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow! I was skeptical when I saw the price, but this monitor really is something. Basic color controls to tweak for your picture preferences. Nothing too fancy. For anyone looking for a solid and straightforward 1080 experience this is a great choice. The built in speakers aren&rsquo;t great of course, but they&rsquo;re not terrible either. They can definitely do in a pinch if you don&rsquo;t have headphones or speakers. The dual HDMI is great! I have my PC on one input and my PS4 on the other. If you want the best bang for your buck, look no further.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="gaming-just-got-better">Gaming just got better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son wanted this and two other items for Christmas. He explained that this monitor was reasonably priced, but still offered gaming features, which is what was important to him. The 22 inch size is great for a teen&rsquo;s desk. The resolution is crisp and bright. He is very pleased with this monitor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-for-the-price">Best for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its even better then I thought it would be. Mine just arrived here today and once I set it up I noticed a huge difference from the monitor I was using before, If you are a gamer and looking for a good monitor this one is definitely the best for the price, I think its the best for pc gaming because its the perfect size but if you are a console gamer and don&rsquo;t mind playing on a medium sized screen then this is definitely the best. It even comes with a decently long DVI to HDMI cable and a VGA cable as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="100-worth-it">100% Worth it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can honestly agree with every other 5 star review on this monitor. You can go through and read what they have to say and it&rsquo;s all true.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite monitors. Looks good!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-despite-frustrating-start">Works great despite frustrating start</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I needed and at a decent price. Clear, bright picture and the audio from the onboard speakers aren&rsquo;t half bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-and-cheap-monitor">Amazing and cheap monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this beautiful monitor for my first ever gaming pc that my friend and i built. This monitor is so gorgeous with it&rsquo;s great resolution and colorful spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="way-better-than-i-thought">Way better than I thought</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to set up looks really good I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be so good so glad I bought it I recommend you buy this at such a great price too</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-monitor-for-any-use">Fantastic monitor for any use</h5>

<p>I love this screen. Pretty much everything about it. My only problem is the speaker get only decent valume at full. They sound nice, just never loud, at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-d-recommend-these-to-anyone">I&rsquo;d recommend these to anyone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 2 of these for a dual monitor setup and am very impressed! My only gripe with these monitors is that they only come with a dvi to hdmi, and vga cables.</p>
