Have you dropped your iPhone 6 and damaged the touch screen, interfering with images? Or has it otherwise become scratched or scuffed?</p>

<p>If your iPhone 6 had damage done to the screen, or if you are having display issues that cause a white or White screen or inky spots that interfere with pictures and other images, you do not have to replace the entire iPhone 6.
For a fraction of the cost, this LCD display and touch screen digitizer assembly replacement can repair a damaged touch screen and the LCD display at the same time. This complete front assembly in white will allow you to see images clearly again, without inky spots or scratches to the touch screen. If your touch screen is not responding properly, this assembly can also replace a broken touch screen, and for a fraction of the cost of a brand new iPhone 6.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-replacement-screen">Excellent Replacement screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this replacement screen to fix the phone of a client. I was very pleased to receive the screen in a clean, sealed box that had foam cut out in the shape of the screen to pack it in tight and keep it safe.The screen also came with a set of tools that were good quality and were helpful with the repair.Most importantly, the screen was intact. When I finished transferring all the necessary parts from the old screen to the new one, I powered up the phone and was pleased to find a perfectly working screen. There were no dead spots, no fading of color or flickering around the edges. The whole screen functioned as intended and looked good as new.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> in Quality5/5 in Functionality5/5 in Care of packaging5/5 in extras (tools and such)I would purchase again from this seller with confidence.</p>

<h5 id="display-is-cloudy-fuzzy-and-a-complete-disappointment-update-super-happy-with-the-exchange-replacement-screen">Display is cloudy, fuzzy, and a complete disappointment – UPDATE: Super happy with the exchange replacement screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE: Amazon&rsquo;s customer service freaking rocks in case anyone was wondering. They sent me the exact same screen (same supplier) as a replacement and it works perfectly – better than any replacement screen I&rsquo;ve ever purchased! This is fantastic, obviously, so I increased the stars to four to accurately show the quality. I&rsquo;m disappointed that it couldn&rsquo;t have been the first time though!</strong>Just installed this screen and really unhappy with this extremely defective product. When I purchase replacement iPhone screens, I don&rsquo;t expect Apple quality by any means and am realistic when it comes to this stuff. I do expect the screen to actually work. This is a straight-up scam of a defective product.The screen displays a fuzzy, pixelated picture that&rsquo;s washed-out and white (had to turn my brightness up all the way just to see everything). It has pinkish streaks running down the screen and won&rsquo;t load the entire display, only pieces of it. It doesn&rsquo;t respond to touch, or just randomly lag (I swipe the screen and it doesn&rsquo;t move for 15 seconds).I&rsquo;m hoping this was a single case of extremely bad luck and I have contact Amazon to replace the item and then I&rsquo;ll send back the defective screen to them/the seller. It&rsquo;s pretty disappointing when you go through all that work to replace the screen just to find out you&rsquo;re worse off than before.</p>

<h5 id="this-product-will-save-a-parents-sanity">This product will save a parents&rsquo; sanity!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought a screen online (not Amazon) thinking it would be better based on the reviews of a YouTube video. Tried to change the screen turn it on&hellip;.. nothing.Desperate, because I have a 2 yr old who is a little damn hellion without his &ldquo;daddy finger&rdquo; and &ldquo;wheels on the bus&rdquo; videos, as well as other educational YouTube channels, I order this out of desperation, and in spite of the negative reviews. 10 minutes and a crooked screen protector later, there is quiet in the house. Daddy can finally enjoy an IPA in peace, while mommy does whatever she wants because the TV is finally mine. Time to catch up on some shows.</p>

<h5 id="kind-of-sucks-especially-when-the-conversation-is-meant-to-be">kind of sucks, especially when the conversation is meant to be &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A few days after I got this phone screen and installed it, my front camera &amp; earpiece started malfunctioning and not working at all. My front facing Camera I can live without but not being able to make phone calls without turning on speaker phone&hellip;kind of sucks, especially when the conversation is meant to be private. I re-did the installation to double check and make sure all the ribbon cables were connected and that I had completed the process properly, even went as far as to order a new speaker, to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t my speaker that was malfunctioning but it was the actual screen/product itself. This product arrived to my house on July 16, 2016 and the quality decreased quickly.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">DO NOT BUY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TERRIBLE!!!! The screens connector was made slanted and my screens LED was very glitchy and barely functioning! I am so disappointed in this screen!! STAY AWAY!!!! Do not buy on here, I bought a better one on amazon that worked perfectly just don&rsquo;t buy from this seller!!!</p>

<p>dont wast your Cash on it.. Its fake</p>

<h5 id="ok-for-the-price-but-falls-short-of-oem">Ok for the price but falls short of OEM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Definitely not OEM but if you&rsquo;re not looking to spend a fortune or are looking to repair you screen so you can trade it in, this will do the trick. I&rsquo;ve replaced dozens of iPhone screens for family and friends and it&rsquo;s always hit or miss with the aftermarket screens. Although they look identical they don&rsquo;t all work the same. This screen was purchased to install on a phone that had a cracked screen but was eligible for an early upgrade (in perfect working condition, of course). This screen fit perfectly and was an easy install, however I immediately noticed minor flaws with it. The screen had some overly sensitive areas. When you would touch these areas or hold the phone to your ear it would start opening random apps. I took it back apart and made sure that all my connections were good and that it wasn&rsquo;t a mistake on my end and it wasn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t speak for every screen produced/sold by this company but the one that I received has plenty of room for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective-product">defective product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen comes in good shape (no damage, everything in place, size fits perfectly on my iphone..). However, upon installing nothing shows up on the screen after several attempts to try to turn my phone on. First, I thought it was my iphone since I did everything myself, maybe there were some damage to other parts of my phone. But after going through all the hassle transferring everything (camera, home button..) back to my old screen, my phone works again. Evidence suggests that seller has sent me a defective product.</p>
