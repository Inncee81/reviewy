<blockquote>
<p> TL;DR - The U818A has lots of pros and a couple of cons, but no deal breakers. It&rsquo;s lightweight and sturdy enough to survive crashes. It&rsquo;s a great quadcopter for someone just getting into the hobby with little or no flight experience, but it&rsquo;s also a fun flyer for someone like me who&rsquo;s been flying longer, too.I&rsquo;ve been flying quadcopters for about a year now, and I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at it. I am more into flying sport quads and racers than camera quads or anything with altitude hold. I probably never would have bought a quadcopter like the U818A, but I won one in a contest on a Facebook group so I was interested in testing it out to see what this quad is all about.Build quality and design are both good and what you&rsquo;d expect to see in a quadcopter in this price range. It&rsquo;s surprisingly light considering how tough and crash-worthy this thing has turned out to be. I wanted to see how tough the body is so I smacked into the house, the ground, a fence and a few trees. It suffered no damage to the body or the well protected props.It comes with 2 700mAh batteries (one is stored in the remote control battery bay) that keep the U818A in the air for 8-10 minutes. I have to say I am not a fan of the way UDI designed the batteries. They used 2 350mAh batteries wrapped together and wired in parallel to come up with the 700mAh rating. The batteries and the U818A have a wonky 4 pin battery connector so you will be forced to use UDI&rsquo;s batteries if you want extras. That also means I can&rsquo;t charge them on my hobby grade charger. The odd battery connector is something that can be simply fixed with a soldering iron, but even still&hellip;Boo! Thumbs down on proprietary batteries, UDI!So how does it fly? Amazingly well and very stably as long as there is little wind. I rarely get windless days living on the Massachusetts coast. The U818A is designed to fly on calmer days. The 10 mile an hour offshore breeze I often have here made it a challenge to keep the U818A were I wanted it to stay. It has an adjustable low rate and a high rate and even in high rate the quad was unhappy with my offshore breeze. That big plastic body the U818A has is great at keeping your props safe from crashes, but it also acts as a sail in the wind. It&rsquo;ll fly in the wind, but the less wind the better.On the couple of windless days I was able to fly on, the U818A did everything UDI says it can do. I press the take off/land button and the quad popped up to about 4 feet in the air and sat there waiting for my input. I raised it up to 10 feet and let go of the throttle and the U818A just hung there at that altitude patiently. The quad stayed at whatever altitude I put it even when I gave it pitch or roll and fley it around. Hmm, now I understand why camera quad guys like altitude hold. It makes for a very stable and smooth flyer. If you are a total noob to flying then altitude hold will help you get and keep the quad in the air while you are figuring out how to make it fly it around. When I pressed the land button again,l the quad slowly landed and turned off the motors. If you press and hold the take off/land button when the quad is in the air, the motors stop immediately and the quad falls to earth. That&rsquo;s a good safety function if your quad is about to fly away on you and you just want it to drop. Headless mode also works and it is another good feature for a new flyer to help stay in the air. I am impressed with these features because on so many quads in the price range these feature do not work well or at all. UDI included them and got them all to work right, too. Kudos, UDI!The U818A comes with a removable camera that will record to an SD card (though you have to use an app on your smartphone to turn the camera recording on/off) and also transmit video via WIFI back to your smart phone. The idea is that this will allow you to fly FPV. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work all that well for flying FPV because there is some lag between the camera transmitting the video and you seeing it, so while the cam works great for seeing where you are or lining up your video shot for recording, it&rsquo;s not really that awesome for FPV flying. When will these manufacturers figure out that 2.4GHz WIFI is useless for FPV flying? As far as video quality is concerned, you can watch my short review video and judge for yourself.At the end of the day this is a fun quadcopter to fly that is packed with some advanced features that actually work. I plan to use this as a trainer for friends who&rsquo;ve never flown a drone but want to give it a try. The alt hold will be great for noobs who want a less frustrating first attempt at flying. Your mom could fly the U818A and I think that is one of the quad&rsquo;s strongest points. The fact that it&rsquo;s easy for someone with little flight time to get this into the air and fly it around. More fun, less frustration :)</p>

<h5 id="drone-going-rogue-but-a-good-rating">Drone going rogue but a good rating?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this drone back when it was a best seller prior to Christmas, experienced a fly away right after Christmas, then noticed there were tons of fly away issues with one star ratings posted on Amazon immediately after Christmas, so I didn&rsquo;t feel quite the idiot I did as we watched ours fly over a large field, over a subdivision, never to be seen again. Then why the 5 star rating, you ask? Well, before posting a review, I contacted the vendor, USA Toyz, to see what they were doing about all of the negative reviews regarding fly aways and I will tell you my experience with them has been first rate and have since received a replacement drone kit. Yes, they took responsibility for the fly away and are in communication with the manufacturer in an attempt to figure out if there is an issue with the drone or whether it was all user error. With it happening in such a large scale, it is their guess it may be something in the middle.So for those of you who have one or are nonetheless considering this particular one, here&rsquo;s my take. The drone has some excellent features for beginners, specifically (1) One Button Takeoff which is hitting one button that will lift the drone then hover at 4 feet and (2) Emergency Shutdown which speaks for itself - IF YOU HOLD IT FOR 1 SECOND. I emphasize the previous text to point out that it is imperative a new user spend some time familiarizing themselves with all of the functions on the transmitter prior to taking your first flight. Yes, that screams common sense (duh) but with the takeoff being so simple with the One Button Takeoff, I believe there may be a tendency for some to just wing it at first without knowing all the details of control.For instance, it should be noted that the transmitter beeps for BOTH an Out of Range alarm AND a Low Battery Alarm and I cannot confirm this yet but I believe they sound the same. If that is the case, one could be getting an Out of Range alarm, mistake it for a Low Battery Alarm, not panic thinking it is about to die and fall from the sky anyway, then watch it fly off into the sunset never to be seen again even though it was trying to tell you &ldquo;my battery is fine but I&rsquo;m getting out of range.&rdquo; The User Manual is not clear as to how long of an Out of Range warning you get before its actually goes rogue on you, but the reference to it in the user manual clearly states that when the the transmitter beeps an Out of Range Alarm, &ldquo;if ignored, the drone may lose control and fly away.&rdquo; And I am here to tell you it will do exactly that.So having said all of that, I cannot necessarily fault the drone with a poor rating as it flies quite well, albeit with or without user interface, but would like to suggest to the manufacturer to modify transmitter communication when its approaching an Out of Range warning, plus perhaps program it to just land itself as soon as it loses communication. With the popularity of this drone and drones in general, a loss of communication is inevitable in large numbers for newbies.</p>

<h5 id="1st-time-droner">1st time Droner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never flown a drone before and I researched high and low for a beginner drone that had specific features I was looking for. Featires like one button landing, altitude hold, made sturdy enough in case I banged it into walls/ground, video/ photo capable and wouldn&rsquo;t break the bank as well. This drone is all of that and more!! I&rsquo;m having a blast flying it around the park, backyard and basement. I flown it into fences, trees and dropped it from about 20ft and it never got damaged enough to where it couldn&rsquo;t fly. The controls take a bit to get used to especially because this is my first time but it doesn&rsquo;t take long to figure it out. Buy this drone!All the best,Alex</p>
