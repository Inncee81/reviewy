<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="looks-great-and-easy-to-apply">Looks great and easy to apply!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen protector looks great and easy to apply. Awesome deal!!!How to apply a screen protector like a pro:1. Fully clean your screen with a wet wipe that is safe for glasses or computer screens, then make sure it is completely dry. Use a different cloth to remove any dust or residues.2. Use the spray included in the box to completely cover your phone screen.3. Use the spray on your fingers that you plan to use when you install the screen protector. If you run out, make more of the fluid by mixing <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> water with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> dish detergent.4. Pull the white sheet off the screen protector and lay that onto your phone screen. Adjust if needed by keeping the screen wet. As long as the screen&rsquo;s wet, the phone will not adhere to the screen protector.5. After aligning, use a squeegee or a credit card to squeeze all the water and bubbles out of the main section.6. Use a clean, dry towel (make sure it doesn&rsquo;t have lint) and dry as much as you can.7. Use your palms to hold down on both curved edges of the phone until it adheres.8. Squeeze and dry water as you&rsquo;re holding the edges.9. Finish with a hair dryer on low heat to completely close the seals.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-protector">Perfect protector !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used screen protectors before and always have trouble with bubbles, and peeling. Not with these. They went on perfectly, and had a squeegee included to remove all the bubbles. After applying the screen protector, it is crystal clear, with no bubbles or peeling. I would highly recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-film-fits-for-my-s8-plus-very-satisfied">Super film fits for my s8 plus. Very satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is a very good product. I am pleased with this purchase. The instruction and video are clear and easy to understand. Everything for installation is there. I just attach the film problem-free. The price is amazing. I am positively surprised how well the film fits. Super on my s8 plus and feels good. Would buy again and recommend it to my friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-option-if-you-follow-the-instructions">Great Option (if you follow the instructions)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this screen protector. This is a wet installation and you do have to let it dry overnight so expect to be without your phone for at least 10 to 12 hours. I&rsquo;ve had the screen protector on for a few days now and I&rsquo;ve experienced no lifting on the curved edges as I did with other screen protectors (especially tempered glass). I also didn&rsquo;t get any bubbles. It looks great! I would say this is an excellent choice especially considering the fact that finding a quality screen protect for this curved screen can be a tough task.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality and fast shipping!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="samsung-screen-protector">Samsung screen protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super easy to use. Just follow the video instructions and it will fit perfectly over the edge of the S8+ like a glove, seemless.Very clear, it doesn&rsquo;t even look like there&rsquo;s a screen protector on it! Only way you can tell is if you look at the top where it&rsquo;s cut around the camera and sensors. No bubbles no lifting. I have to say I am greatly impressed.It feels natural as well so it doesn&rsquo;t feel worse than the glass screen like a lot of them do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-protection">Great protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought this brand of screen protectors before and knew the quality was great. I wanted to have a backup set in case I needed it. Since my phone was very costly I&rsquo;ll never take it without a screen protector. I love how easy these are to apply. They even have a help video in case you might need assistance. They feel like a thick plastic but do not take anything away from your screen. I also love how these fit perfect with any case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-some-flaws-though">Good Product, some flaws though</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have now put on 4 of these on my S8+. While this does the job, there are two issues I have with it. One of those issues isn&rsquo;t the fault of this screen protector, but that of the S8. That issue is that not matter what you try, no screen protector will work with a case on a phone with curved edges. That will not happen. The second issue is that <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> screen protectors from this brand that I have put on have had a &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; effect on the top. I put on the screen protector as is instructed but the rainbow is occurs.A final issue I have is that the small piece they put in the box to help you flatten the screen protector onto the phone and push out bubbles is a small, thin piece of plastic, not the rubber piece you used to get with the screen protectors of a few years ago. That&rsquo;s annoying.</p>

<p>Keeps lifting at the ends</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cant-use-under-a-case">Cant use under a case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cover seemed very protective. I let my husband&rsquo;s dry for 24 hours. Put his case on and it lifted right off. Mine was on for over a week before my case came.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Terrible!! It does not adhere to the curves sides of my Galaxy S8+.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install. The process was well explained. the screen protector is clear and almost looks like nothig</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kit-for-your-phone">Great kit for your phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I planned on getting an S8 soon, and I needed a protective screen, as I have a bad history of dropping my phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wasted-takes-too-long-and-still-ended-up-with-unremovable-bubbles-under-the-protector">$ wasted, takes too long and still ended up with unremovable bubbles UNDER the protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do NOT buy this unless your want a hard challenge!! Watched vid, WAY, WAY too many steps and wait 12hr to dry before applying case?! WTF is wrong with your people? Get real!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not lose your money by it</p>
