<h5 id="ibanez-talman-tcy10-acoustic-electric-guitar-black">Ibanez Talman TCY10 Acoustic-Electric Guitar (Black)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is actually my second Ibanez acoustic. My first one played beautifully, and I gave it to my nephew (who was about 9 years old at the time) when he expressed an interest in learning to play guitar.The Talman TCY10 is my new favorite. First of all, it arrived in perfect condition from Tinmusic (California). They took great care in packaging and shipping.Right out of the shipping box, the Talman felt very comfortable to play. The sound is very rich and full, even though the guitar is a shallow-body style. Even the low-end notes feel full and dense&hellip;usually it takes a dreadnought-style body for sound this good. Although I usually play &ldquo;unplugged&rdquo;, I did try playing through an amp, and the sound is just as good when amplified.Aesthetically speaking, the Talman looks terrific, too. The &ldquo;flying cutaway&rdquo; body style just looks cool, and the finish is flawless and shiny. It comes in other colors (besides black), but the construction &amp; craftsmanship are obviously the most important things. If you&rsquo;re thinking about purchasing a Talman (which you should), pick whatever color you like.I would recommend the Talman to any acoustic guitar player, from beginners to seasoned professionals.I am somewhere in-between, and I always will be.</p>

<h5 id="this-will-make-you-happy">This will make you happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have several guitars, ranging from cheap to expensive. This is my second Ibanez, and I play it all the time. It is the easiest of all to play, and stays in tune. I like the convenience of the tuner. If you want a good guitar, built well and durable, get it. Personally, I think this should be called a hollow body electric. The body is smaller than a normal acoustic, and you will need to get some good strings. I replaced the nut, bridge, and pegs with TUSQ components, just because. I think the ones that come on it are actually pretty good to begin with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-winner">a winner!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such a good instrument for such a reasonable price. The frets were a little rough but the sound quality right out of the box was great. The only adjustment I made the first week was changing strings. This was to eliminate some ofvthe extra shimmer when playing through chorus effects pedal, largely a matter of personal taste.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very nice</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-guitar">Good Guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this little guitar. I &ldquo;noodled&rdquo; around on one like this over a few months before finally ordering this one for myself. I was hesitant about ordering any guitar online, but I took a chance, and it worked out fine.Sound:This type of guitar has a distinct sound that is somewhere between that of a small size guitar and that of a regular size guitar. But it is an electric acoustic guitar, so if you need a bigger sound, you may connect it to a sound system via the jack on the bottom of the guitar, adjust the controls, and it should work just fine for the average player.If possible, play one before you buy one. Check your local music store/&ldquo;Guitar Center&rdquo; store, or, if you are lucky, your local pawn shop for one you can try out.My experience:When I first played it fresh out of the box, it sounded &ldquo;okay&rdquo; but not great. Then something strange happened. The more I played it, it seemed to sound progressively worse&ndash;particularly the &ldquo;D&rdquo; string. I tweaked the tuning a bit and played it some more. Still there was little improvement. I began contemplating returning it for a refund, or possibly replacing the tuning pegs and strings.But, after a couple of hours playing it, it started sounding better and better and more like the others I&rsquo;ve played. I tweaked the tuning a little more, and now it sounds good to my ears. I&rsquo;m not sure what the problem was, Perhaps it was adjusting to a temperature change.Bottom line:ProsIt&rsquo;s a very good little guitar. Not GREAT, but this one works well for me.. I like the small&ndash;but not too small&ndash; size of the guitar, its distinctive sound, and, yes, I do like the way it looks.. It&rsquo;s a good size for mid-size children that they can grow into. It holds a tuning well. It has the capability to be connected to a sound system for enhancement. It&rsquo;s probably a good choice as a first guitar, a better-quality second guitar, or just a extra guitar for a different sound when you need it.ConsNone really. Just be prepared to give this guitar a couple of hours of &ldquo;warm-up&rdquo; playing before it &ldquo;settles&rdquo; into your groove.</p>

<h5 id="fun-to-play">Fun to Play</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this guitar, although I had to adjust the rod several times, it had a hard time keeping tune in the beginning. Great action and fun to play, and it&rsquo;s so comfortable, the slim design is amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-really-nice">Its really nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its a steel string guitar that comes with low action so its not hard to press on the string which is exactly what i was looking for. It&rsquo;s a decent size. Not too big not too small. Has built in tuner. Its acoustic electric. No issues at all</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-guitar">great guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love the feel of the body shape but had a bot of the skin that goes over the shell come off around the soundhole but is not noticable unless you look up close</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-first-guitar">Great first guitar!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first guitar and I&rsquo;m loving it!! Sounds great, easy to handle, easy to care for. I like the thinner body and it is slighter smaller in size/shape compared to my&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-intermediate-level-guitar">Very good intermediate level guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good intermediate level guitar. Great tone both acoustic and electric. Easy to play, my son loves it.</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-money">Worth the money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I played about 15 acoustic guitars at Sam Ash today many price ranges , this one felt better than many that were $200 more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective">Defective!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a terrible guitar! As soon as I started playing it- buzzing everywhere, the frets were unleveled/uneven, intonation problems, 15th-21st frets totally unplayable!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-finish-of-the-guitar-wasn-t-good-it-looks-like-a-second">The finish of the guitar wasn&rsquo;t good, it looks like a second</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The finish of the guitar wasn&rsquo;t good, it looks like a second, I&rsquo;m not a fussy person but this was even bad by my standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-sounding-guitar-i-ve-had-in-years">Best sounding guitar I&rsquo;ve had in years</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 2. Best sounding guitar I&rsquo;ve had in years. When I want to set around and strum a bit, no electronics involved, this is my go to instrument. Nice full ring.</p>
