<p>Product Description
Can a laptop charger actually be cool? We think so. When we designed the Zolt Laptop Charger Plus we wanted to create a product that was both highly functional and aesthetically beautiful. From it&rsquo;s sleek, durable exterior to its ground breaking power electronics circuitry, Zolt is anything but ordinary.
From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>ULTRA LIGHT, SUPER COMPACT AND OH SO PORTABLE

<p>About the Startup</p>

<p>Describe your product in 3 words.</p>

<p>Multi device charger.
How did you come up with the idea for this product?</p>

<p>Year-over-year consumers have come to expect their digital devices to have greater functionality and increase performance while being packaged in smaller and sleeker form factors. Nowhere is this trend more prevalent than with today’s laptops and Ultrabooks. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to find many weighing in at less than 2 pounds. While there&rsquo;s been a great deal of focus on these new generation laptops, there&rsquo;s been very little advancement in the power adapters that accompany them. They&rsquo;re often bulky and unwieldy, adding as much as 25 - 40% more in size and weight to carry. Even worse, most are only good for one thing — charging just a laptop.
What makes your product special?</p>

<p>Enter the Zolt Laptop Charger Plus — smaller, lighter, smarter. Zolt has been reimagined from the ground up with patented proprietary power technology and custom designed components. Utilizing Zolt’s EPC (efficient power conversion) technology, one Zolt is able to power a laptop and two additional portable devices simultaneously. With Zolt, users can now travel with a single charger and avoid lugging heavy laptop power bricks and multiple device chargers.
What has been the best part of your startup experience?</p>

<p>Even for a company like Zolt, with a combined 50+ years of experience in power solutions, making an ultra compact, ultra light, multi-device power adapter was no small task. It’s not just a matter of shrinking components — it was a complete re-imagination of the laptop power adapter from the ground up. It required taking a new approach to power electronics circuitry, out-of-the-box mechanical design and relentless pursuit of beautiful industrial design. We think our efforts paid off in the end — we think you’ll feel the same.</p>

<h5 id="the-zolt-universal-laptop-charger-is-this-the-ultimate-charger">The Zolt Universal Laptop Charger: Is This The Ultimate Charger?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Re-posting my blog review:<a href="http://www.jasondunn.com/zolt-universal-laptop-charger-review/#more-4578Hope">http://www.jasondunn.com/zolt-universal-laptop-charger-review/#more-4578Hope</a> it helps people make an informed decision!At AT&amp;T I don’t travel for work as much as I used to for HTC, but when I do I usually bring my personal laptop with me – and that means two different power supplies. I use a Rocketfish universal charger for my HP work laptop (a rather chunky and heavy machine) and the Dell charger for my XPS 13. The Dell charger is small, but the Rocketfish charger is your typical brick. It has a USB port for charging though, which is a big improvement over your typical charger. Together, carrying the two chargers is a hassle, especially since I fly carry-on 95% of the time. I usually put both chargers in a carrying case inside my carry-on luggage.In my quest for a new, lightweight universal charger I backed the FinSix Dart on Kickstarter back in April of 2014. After waiting 19 months (!?!), I gave up waiting and requested a refund. Props to FinSix for giving out refunds – many Kickstarter campaigns do not.I then ordered a Zolt: it seemed better in every way. Getting it was a bit of a fiasco – they didn’t indicate there would be a wait on getting it, so I was expecting to receive it shortly after the November 19th launch date. The neglected to communicate that’s when pre-orders would start shipping. It was almost five weeks later, a day after I left to spend two weeks in Calgary that they informed me they were shipping the Zolt. I think it’s pretty foolish to surprise ship a product right at the holidays when so many people travel, but I give credit to their customer service team: they were able to re-direct the shipment and ship it out the day I got back. There was a bit of a delay, but I finally received it. I’ve had a couple of days now and here are my thoughts so far.*** The Good <strong><em>- It’s lightweight. My Dell + Rocketfish charger combo weighed in at 20 ounces (1 lbs. 6 oz) For comparison’s sake, the iPad Pro is 25 ounces (1 lb. 9 oz). The Zolt? A mere 6 ounces, and that includes the charger, the two tips I need, and the power cable. The Zolt is 333% lighter to carry than my previous combo, and at least 300% smaller in overall volume when you factor in the carrying case. I fly carry-on nearly all the time, so every bit of weight and space saved is welcomed.- It has two USB ports for mobile device charging. I tested my iPad Air 2, and the USB port kicks out 2.05 Amps (as measured by my Legion USB Power Meter). With my HTC One connected, it draws 1.10 Amps.- It can charge it all at once. I connected my Dell XPS 13 (in sleep mode) to it and measured the power draw with a Kill-A-Watt power meter. It was drawing 31 watts. I added my iPad Air 2 into the mix, and the total use rose to 42 watts. When I added my HTC One phone, it rose to 50 watts total.- Power to the mobile device USB ports remains nearly constant if the laptop gets hungry. With the Dell XPS 13 plugged in and charging, the screen brightness at maximum, and the CPU usage at 100% (Handbrake encoding) all devices together were pulling 59 watts. When I had my iPad Air 2 connected, it was pulling 2 amps. The HTC One dropped to 0.95 amps. A slight decline, but not much.- It comes with a variety of tips that will fit most PCs. If you need a Macbook charger you can get that for $19.99.</em></strong> The Bad <strong><em>- It sometimes makes noise. I’ve only had this for a couple of days, so I’m not sure if this is a solid pattern, but twice now I’ve had instances where it sounds vaguely like whining water (it sort of…gurgles and whines). It’s not loud by any means, but in a quiet room it’s clearly audible – and you’d hear it in a hotel room if you were trying to sleep. I don’t usually leave my devices plugged in overnight, so this shouldn’t be an issue for me.- The USB ports for mobile devices don’t put out as much power as a stand-alone charger. If you look at my numbers for the ChargeTech charger, you’ll see it gave my iPad Air 2.35 amps and my HTC One phone 1.48 amps. That’s ~25-34% less power coming from the Zolt. So for the convenience of an all-in-one unit, you’re losing a bit of speed on charging your devices.- It’s a bit pricey. At $99, it’s at least 5x more expensive than your average universal charger found on Amazon.com (price start at around $15).- Who picked the colours? I opted for boring grey because Ultra Violet and Electric Orange aren’t my thing. I’d have enjoyed a red or a blue. At least they offered gray instead of boring old black!</em></strong> The Verdict ***As long as that whining sound doesn’t get more frequent, this thing is a winner. It’s small, lightweight, and let’s me charge a laptop and two mobile devices at once. I’ve read comments elsewhere that says you can even connect a mobile device to the top “laptop” USB port, so you can charge three mobile devices in a pinch. Apparently there’s a USB-C version on the way as well. For me, this is well worth $99 and I look forward to use it on my next trip.</p>

<h5 id="it-worked-for-29-days-then-caught-fire-scared-the-living-hell-out-of-me">It worked, for 29 days&hellip; Then caught fire&hellip; Scared the living hell out of me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh my god, this is the most unsafe charger yet. How is this thing even UL listed? I was happily charging away on my Thinkpad, then my laptop just turned off, suddenly. Then I hear a buzzing sound from the charger. It looks like there is a fireworks show going on inside it, smoke pouring out, a mini fire is happening in my room. My GFCI then tripped, scared the living hell out of me. This product needs to be pulled off the market RIGHT NOW. No wonder they went out of business. If I didn&rsquo;t have a GFCI outlet in my room, who knows what could have happened. Thank god my laptop survived, or I would have been out 1200$.My room is filled with smoke, my hands smells like burnt plastic.Glad it blew up within the return period. I can actually get my money back.</p>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a product with more mixed reviews than this one. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a batch issue but it seems it either works like a charm or is totally useless. I&rsquo;ve been using it for nearly a month now, and so far I&rsquo;m in the former camp. To give it a durability test, I keep it at work and plugged in <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> connected to my Toshiba PC. It&rsquo;s constantly charging, gets a little warm but not hot, no whining noise. From time to time I charge my iPhone and/or iPad at the same time, and it charges pretty quickly. I&rsquo;ve taken it on the road and it worked in Germany, the Netherlands, Russia and Japan with no problem. It helped reduce the electronic accessories I have to carry when travelling and if you want to lighten your load, now is a good time to try as it&rsquo;s sold at $72 right now. I can only hope I won&rsquo;t come back in a month and report it died on me&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="bad-customer-service-tech-support">Bad customer service &amp; tech support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought several of these for laptop users (HP EliteBook 840 &amp; 850) so they could minimize what they travel with. Zolt&rsquo;s compatibility page says it works with these laptops, but it doesn&rsquo;t. The Zolt adapter should be the Z5, but it about 1mm too short &amp; won&rsquo;t connect (see picture). I contacted Zolt customer service &amp; they never got back to me after promising to do so. I contacted tech support, who wasted 2 emails asking me to repeat information in the original email before they seemed to agree that their adapter wouldn&rsquo;t work. Their fix? Subscribe to their email list so I would be aware when/if they came out with a new end that would work. No offer to take it back or other suggestions. They just blew me off.On the plus side, when their adapters do work, it&rsquo;s a handy device. It does work with some other laptops &amp; devices. Just be aware that if it doesn&rsquo;t work, they couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>

<p>I wanted to love it. I really did. I waited until it was in stock to order so I wouldn&rsquo;t forget about it.At first, it seemed great. Nice packaging, cute litle bag. Easy organization for the swappable tips. Cool beans. Tested it briefly with two different laptops before leaving for a trip and it worked just fine. Loved the idea of only needing one charger for my laptop and two phones and tablet that I usually take with me (techie if you haven&rsquo;t guessed).LEFT for the trip and went to use it. Ah well&hellip;hmm. Yep, it charges my laptop as expected. Plug my phone in&hellip;nothing. Scratch my head a bit and get a different USB cable. Scratch my head more because that doesn&rsquo;t work either. Unplug the laptop, no help. Plug into the other USB port&hellip;bingo, it works.Plug laptop back in, all good. Plug other phone in using the &ldquo;good&rdquo; port&hellip;nothing. Change USB ports, works again.And so on. In short, one randonly selected USB port won&rsquo;t charge what&rsquo;s plugged into it. Sometimes neither will work and I&rsquo;m stuck unplugging or re-plugging in various orders until I can charge my phone.Why one star? Well, fanciness aside this has one function: charge my devices. It doesn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t care how small, pretty, convenient or inexpensive (which it isn&rsquo;t) something is. If it doesn&rsquo;t serve it&rsquo;s fundamental function, it&rsquo;s of no use. Beyond that, I also expect the tiny pins on the swappable tips to eventually get bent.Back to carrying two chargers&hellip;</p>
