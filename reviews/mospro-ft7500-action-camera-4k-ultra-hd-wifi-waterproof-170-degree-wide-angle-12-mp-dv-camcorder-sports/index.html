<h5 id="super-little-camera">SUPER LITTLE CAMERA!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little bitty camera/recorder is so amazing!!! When I ordered this camera it was due to deliver on the day that my family was leaving on vacation, so we had a late leave because I really wanted to take it and try it out. I&rsquo;m so glad that we waited because this little camera really really surprised me!! We used it on the way roller coaster ride and at the beach in the water and it took amazingly clear and focused pictures and videos. It&rsquo;s super compact and light-weight to fit basically anywhere!! And it comes with TONS of accessories!! Bike mounts, wrist mounts, hat/helmet mounts. It also comes with a remote if u wanted to set the camera down to take family photos or videos!! It comes with a waterproof case as well!! While we were on vacation, we went to the local WM and printed the pictures that were taken and I&rsquo;ve got to say I&rsquo;m super super impressed how great pictures from this camera turned out!! I would highly highly recommend this camera/recorder to anyone looking!! I&rsquo;ve posted photos of camera, accessories, and pictures to show how clear the photos turn out!!</p>

<h5 id="fun-inexpensive-gopro-alternative-with-neat-features-and-above-average-quality">Fun, Inexpensive GoPro Alternative with Neat Features and Above-average Quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am going to be brutally honest here&hellip;my expectations for this camera were fairly LOW. I have only used it a couple of times, so I can&rsquo;t comment on longevity but I can comment on what I know about this camera, so here goes&hellip;Build Quality:Camera quality is actually really good! It doesn&rsquo;t feel super cheap; it feels sturdy. The buttons are tactile and snappy, and the finish is very nice.Image/Video Quality:No big surprise here&hellip;the images are good&ndash;but not excellent. I wouldn&rsquo;t use this to print images, but for fun videos and great action shots, this fits the bill nicely. Minimum focus distance is around 8-10 inches.For my rudimentary video quality test, I simply walked along my porch looking at the flowers in the garden. No action, just slow panning to see how the camera would react:4K 25 FPS: Video quality is shaky/jittery even when using the latest/fastest SD card. This is a major bummer&hellip;video not usable2K 30 FPS: Video quality is shaky/jittery&hellip;not usable.1080P 60FPS: Wow, video looks really good. This is probably what I will use!1080P 30FPS: Video still looks good&hellip;this will use less storage but quality isn&rsquo;t as nice as 60FPS780P 120FPS: Did not look good/video was jittery and shaky even though the recording was smooth(I had uploaded a video, but the compression by Amazon made it look horrible)Package Deal:Wow, tons of usable mounts! I plan to keep this camera in the waterproof case at all times, unless I find a reason otherwise. I like to keep it protected. I was able to drill a couple of holes into the tripod mount and mount it below my GARMIN out-in-front mount on my bicycle. With a little piece of rubber from a blown tube as a shock absorber, the camera shake isn&rsquo;t horrible.Points to note:-Video is recorded in 10 Minute chunks-Wifi doesn&rsquo;t connect to your network at home, it connects to your phone and allows you to control/view the phone with an app-Phone app is not bad, but it crashed several times while I was using it-Recording time will likely be closer to an hour, not a full 90 minutes-Record with the camera in your RIGHT hand to help avoid stray fingers ending up in the shotI really like the camera and have purchased a GoPro Session 5 to compare; but for the price, this tiny camera is great!</p>

<h5 id="great-price-for-sport-camera">great price for sport camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good camera for the price, and quality is worth with this price. I used this for underwater video and the video came out super clear! the package come with camera most likely for bicycle. the set up is pretty easy. just wifi connection i have to google it. the software for phone is kind simple, no fancy stuff. well so far so good. just like what i said price is good. doing the same thing like go pro.</p>

<h5 id="this-camera-is-awesome-i-ve-used-it-in-my-pool-and-as">This camera is awesome, I&rsquo;ve used it in my pool and as &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This camera is awesome, I&rsquo;ve used it in my pool and as a dash cam so far, and its great. I would never buy a gopro again at $400. Sory for the choppy video, Amazon must be rendering it somehow, but the picture quality is perfect on the pc and tv.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera-great-videos-great-value">Great camera, great videos, great value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this camera to take with us to Belgium and the Netherlands in order to document some of the biking trip we will be taking from Brugge to Amsterdam. I have been doing trial runs here in the United States to make sure we know how the camera works and if it will be worth even taking with us and we have been very surprised by the quality of the videos taken from my bike helmet. We are very excited to know that we will be able to document our ride later this month.Pros: Great videos not jumpy and the colors are quite good. The wide angle lens gives you a larger perspective which is great for cycling.The Wifi software is fantastic, very easy to use after a few trial and error frustrations. I can show the videos on my iPad and they look great. The number of mounts is amazing. We can put this on the handle bars or wear it on my helmet as I am now and there are several other options we haven&rsquo;t tried. The plastic case feel very solid but like any plastic we will need to keep it protected. Battery life seems pretty good, Ran the camera for about an hour this morning and it used about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of one battery.Cons: No sound when the camera is in the protective case which is about the only way to use this on a bike. There are very few options regarding the video playback, in fact all I can find is play and stop.All in all this is a great camera especially for the price we paid.</p>
