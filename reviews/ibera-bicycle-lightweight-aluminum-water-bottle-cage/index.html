<h5 id="excellent-for-holding-28-ounce-steel-insulated-bottles">Excellent for Holding 28 ounce Steel Insulated Bottles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bough these to replace a traditional set of bottle holders and allow us to bring along insulated water bottles.My chief concern was whether these would be able to support the weight of those bottles. They&rsquo;re 28 ounce monsters from Costco that are double-wall vacuum insulated. When full of water and ice, they&rsquo;re actually a few pounds and could easily double as blunt weapons to kill a man. The traditional holders we had on our bikes were no where near big enough, and part of the problem is the design automatically limits the type of bottle.Not the case with the Ibera holders. Because they open to the sides, it was much easier to get the bottles in. I was worried the small tab at the bottom wouldn&rsquo;t be sufficient, but so far we&rsquo;ve biked a dozen or so miles with the 28 ounce bottles and they&rsquo;ve stayed firmly in place. I even tested them by dropping the bike from a foot or so off the ground repeatedly and the bottles didn&rsquo;t budge.As some other reviewers have noted, these holders will likely scrape up your bottles. But (and this is in response to a rather prominent complaint), I would point out that a little paint or some scrapes and dings on a water bottle does not actually ruin said water bottle. Believe it or not (talking at this other reviewer), a metal cylinder still holds water regardless of what it looks like. That said, if it&rsquo;s a real concern, I would imagine that a little electrical tape wrapped around the lips of the holder would clear this problem right up.</p>

<h5 id="best-seller-for-a-reason-works-great-and-looks-great">&ldquo;Best Seller&rdquo; for a reason! Works GREAT and Looks GREAT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>GREAT water bottle holder. I got this product because it was the &ldquo;Best Seller&rdquo; on Amazon for water bottle holders. Any decent one at my local bike shop was twenty bucks, but this thing is less than half that and works like a charm, not to mention it looks sharp on my bike. When I need a second water bottle holder I will for sure come back and get this same model. This thing will be attached to your bike for a long time, get something that WORKS, get THIS!Purchase with confidence! I always like to rate my products (star wise) based on two different things: how excited I was to get the product when that glorious Amazon box shows up at my door, and how likely I am to buy it again and have the same sort of excitement the second, third, etc, time it shows up. This product got 5 stars because I was excited to get it and was overly pleased with the quality of the product.I would definitely purchase again or recommend this product to any of my friends!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-looks-great">Excellent quality, looks great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This water bottle holder is perfect for my new Diamondback Vital 2! The black color has a matte finish, which I really like. Assembly was easy, and it looks great. So far I have had a couple different water bottles in there and they all fit and stay in. This is not a cheaply made holder. It is lightweight but very sturdy and durable. I&rsquo;m really happy with the purchase and will buy again for my family&rsquo;s bikes!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-solid-water-bottle-cages-for-the-money">Pretty solid water bottle cages for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well-made water bottle holders! Holds my 24fl oz water bottle perfectly snug and doesn&rsquo;t rattle or bend easily. Installtion is easy peasy, all there is to do is install both screws to hold the cage. The only big downside from my experience is that the cage can sometimes scratch the plastic or paint off the waterbottle. To fix this, I just used some super fine sandpaper to sand down the edges of the cage. Overall, I am very pleased with the durability of the water bottle holder as it can maintain a hold of my water bottle even on rough/off-road terrains.*Another note: This water bottle holder is meant for bigger water bottles. Standard 16.9fl oz bottles wont be held securely as the bottom support piece is too short. Any bumps or harsh turns can easily shake them out.</p>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Went on my Giant Defy 1 easy and look good. They hold my Polar Bottles very well.</p>

<h5 id="great-look-great-price">Great Look, Great Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cage, looks great on my bike. I ordered the carbon design.This is the 2nd one that I&rsquo;ve ordered and I have ordered 1 more of these since ordering this one.I will have 2 on my bike and one on my girlfriends.We haven&rsquo;t had any issues with water bottles falling out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="value-and-quality-in-a-nice-design">Value and quality in a nice design!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting out I am not a weight weanie, I don&rsquo;t count grans or ounces at least not on my bicycles. Though these seem comparable to most all but a few carbon cages I have used. The thing I look for is good retention and ease of removal and getting my bottle back in. These are perfect just enough spring to make the process easy and still great hold on my fat bike, I have 4 mounted on my bikes and a couple on my family&rsquo;s and have gifted these as well. Never disappointed and the price is a value compared to similar designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-little-on-the-tight-side">A little on the tight side</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Way too tight. Makes getting the bottle (CamelBak groove 600ml 3inch diameter) very difficult. It feels like it&rsquo;s going to snap or ruin the frame. So far that hasn&rsquo;t happened though but after only 50 miles or so the cage became loose to the point I had to retighten the screws to keep it from falling off. Looks good for sure but I almost wish I&rsquo;d bought a different cage.Edit: still somewhat tight, but seems to have loosened some. Enough that I have decided to give the product 4 stars and I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;d recommend this product now.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very lightweight and it matches my Road Bike perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-water-bottle-cage">Quality Water Bottle Cage</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>I would rather have a more flexible bottle cage honestly. These are standard cages that do what you want them to do, but if you want high quality cages that are easy to get a&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-bottle-cage-for-the-price">Great bottle cage for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these to match the color scheme of my bike. the price is right and they work great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-use-with-a-rear-mount">Do not use with a rear mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this with a rear mounted system. These didn&rsquo;t make it 100 miles. One of them ended up falling off, which could be the mount.</p>

<p>Great product!</p>
