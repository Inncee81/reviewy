<h5 id="a-future-proof-feature-packed-7-2-channel-avr-for-your-music-and-movies">A &ldquo;future-proof&rdquo;, feature-packed 7.2 channel AVR for your music and movies!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this Denon AVR-S720W elsewhere (sorry Amazon!) after months, and I mean months, of research. I was torn between this unit and the Yamaha RX-V679BL as well as its most-recent successor the Yamaha RX-V681BL.In the end, I opted for the Denon unit for a few major reasons. First and foremost, the Denon AVR-S720W supports Dolby Atmos right out of the box, and will have a firmware update in the Fall 2016 which will include DTS:X support. Rather than forcing you to buy next year&rsquo;s model (or a higher-priced unit) you&rsquo;re getting features like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, 4K and HDR Pass-Through, features that I couldn&rsquo;t find on any other receivers in this price range.Installation was extremely simple. The Denon utilizes high-quality screw-type posts for ALL speaker terminals, (unlike the Yamaha which has two bare-wire connectors for Zone 2), allowing you to use banana plugs if you so choose. I was able to easily connect it to my wired and wireless network (not necessary for installation), which allowed me to test out the AirPlay feature from my iPad which worked with ease.One of my favorite features (which is fairly common on A/V&rsquo;s at this price point) is the Zone 2 Audio feature. Our pool/back porch area has two outdoor speakers which are wired into the &ldquo;Zone 2/Surround Back&rdquo; speaker terminals. Coupled with the iPad, this allows us to listen to and control the music from the back porch and pool. With these two speakers utilized for the outdoor setup, we&rsquo;re left with the possibility of 5.2 stereo inside the house. We currently have it set up as a 5.1 channel system, and the Denon includes audio calibration via the Audyssey microphone and software which tailors the sound output to your speaker arrangement for optimal playback.If you are like me, and were comparing the AVR-S710W to the AVR-S720W, the main differences that I found worthwhile are that the 720W supports:- DTS:X / DTS Neural:X compatibility via the firmware update as previously mentioned- Dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi (meaning both 5GHz and the older 2.4GHz variants)- Custom audio curves using the included Audyssey microphone and the downloadable Android/OS app- RC Source Select (more on this below)The RC Source Select is an interesting feature that you&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I have this!&rdquo; once you find out about it. For example, let&rsquo;s say you want to switch between your cable-box and the Blu-Ray player without turning on the AVR. With RC Source Select, the AVR can remain in its low-power &ldquo;Standby&rdquo; mode while allowing you to change your TV input from the cable-box to the Blu-Ray player. This comes in handy if you&rsquo;re like me and don&rsquo;t use the AVR constantly. Without RC Source Select, you&rsquo;d have to turn on the AVR, switch HDMI inputs, and turn the AVR again. It is not fool-proof though, at least for me, as I haven&rsquo;t quite gotten this feature to work with our Xbox 360S.A couple of notes worth mentioning, but not worth removing/adding stars to the rating. The Denon remote feels like it&rsquo;s much more user-friendly than the Yamaha, incorporating larger buttons and gaps to find your way around the buttons when the lights are turned down. My only complaint about the receiver is that it would&rsquo;ve been nice to have two extra audio channels! Having two speakers tied up via Zone 2 on the porch stereo, it would&rsquo;ve been nice to have 7.2 dedicated channels inside the house. Along with that (at the time of writing this review), Pandora streaming is not working on the Denon AVR&rsquo;s. Denon is aware of the issue and is working to fix it. Hopefully it is fixed soon and I can update my review.All in all, it has all the features that I needed in a receiver, including a few that I didn&rsquo;t expect, at a price that was affordable yet not outrageous. Good luck, and enjoy the movies and music!I&rsquo;ve only had this AVR for a couple weeks, so I haven&rsquo;t gone through all the ins-and-outs yet, I hope to report back in the future once I&rsquo;ve had some time to break it in. If you have any questions, please let me know!</p>

<h5 id="extremely-irritating-ridiculous-major-bug-with-weird-remedy">Extremely Irritating, Ridiculous, Major Bug&hellip;with Weird Remedy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>[LATEST UPDATE as of 23 December 2016: Subject unit appears successfully repaired, is fully reliable after warranty replacement of an internal HDMI board. For detail, see my reply to ladame&rsquo;s inquiry on December 21, 2016. The subject Denon receiver now works, and I love it. - SDM]Original text follows&hellip;Yes I like the AVR-S720W. However there is a major&hellip;and absolutely ridiculous&hellip;bug that has hit numerous users, and web searching this will get many hits, wherein NO SOUND comes from the speakers. The unit may have worked perfectly for the last five times you turned it on, but this time you might only see the Amazon video (or CD, or DVD, or whatever source you&rsquo;re using&hellip;) but you cannot get sound. No, the Mute is not turned on. Yes, the volume is turned up. No, the cables haven&rsquo;t been changed or jostled since last use. There is just plain No Sound through your speakers.The sound MAY return after shutting the receiver down and turning it back on. Or it may return after you&rsquo;ve done several shutdowns. For me, it seemed to help if I switched from the Amazon movie I was trying to watch, to playing a DVD. Get the DVD started (which usually would get the sound back), then shut down, then restart the Amazon movie&hellip;.and the sound probably works now.After finally searching online about this problem, I located a thread wherein another owner stated he had called Denon and spoken with a tech, who told him ~ &ldquo;This is going to sound really weird, but try blowing into the headphone jack.&rdquo; That writer tried it, and it worked. The sound came back.Many other respondents to that same thread subsequently reported that they had the same problem, tried blowing into the headphone receptacle, and most of them also got the sound back. They also thanked the original writer profusely.I tried it&hellip;.No sound.So I fired up the air compressor, lugged an air hose into the house, attached the air gun, gave the headphone jack a good, strong blast&hellip;and the sound returned! The sound remained for the next few cycles before the problem began coming back intermittently.So I fired up the air compressor&hellip;.problem went away again.I should note that, after reading of the &ldquo;fix&rdquo;, I had first tried using a non-metallic, physical probe in the headphone receptacle. I knew the receiver would reliably &ldquo;see&rdquo; that something was in the headphone jack because the status changed&hellip;reliably&hellip;on the LED display each time. But regardless of my seeing a reliable response on the front panel, by that method the sound didn&rsquo;t necessarily return when the &ldquo;headphone&rdquo; was removed, even though the electronics saw the change.My best guess is that the triggering threshold of some internal component is getting a signal to switch states, that is too weak. That&rsquo;s what the defect acts like anyway.Other reviewers have given the product enough valid praise; I&rsquo;m giving one star just to draw attention to the described major problem that I&hellip;and apparently numerous other owners&hellip;have encountered.I have one point of hope to offer:This review was written on October 2nd, 2016. Just last night and for the first time ever, a notice popped up on my viewing screen that overlaid the movie I was watching: A Firmware Update was available for the Denon AVR-S720W. The notice automatically disappeared after a few seconds and the family finished watching the movie then retired for the evening.I came back and turned the receiver (and viewing monitor) back on&hellip;and the same notice popped up immediately on the monitor screen. This time I accepted the upgrade. The notice said &ldquo;about 28 minutes to install&rdquo;, and it actually took about 20 minutes. I&rsquo;ve found no detailed description of what was upgraded but let&rsquo;s hope the &ldquo;no sound&rdquo; problem has been addressed.I&rsquo;ll mention that my AV system is controlled through a Logitech Harmony Ultra remote; the &ldquo;no sound&rdquo; problem has occurred while using that remote, while using Denon&rsquo;s own remote packaged with the AVR-S720W, and even when controlling the receiver directly at its front panel. All the same.One last point, I not only could not find that upgrade by going to the Denon website, but in their firmware upgrade list, the AVR-S720W does not even exist. The 710W is there, but not the 720W. Again this was encountered on October 2nd 2016.ADDENDUM 1: 06 October 2016: The firmware update did not help the problem. My unit continues to sporadically wake up with no sound. Also when web searching for help I found that: a) some other Denon models are also affected; b) this issue has haunted multiple generations of Denon products. Sounds great when working but imagine the angst of having company over to watch a vid, starting the program with your new Denon receiver and&hellip;.No Sound. - SDMADDENDUM 2: 19 October 2016: New Tactic Tried and Failed, &ldquo;No Sound&rdquo; persists: This time I ordered Hosa D5 contact cleaner from Amazon. I sprayed this into the headphone jack then inserted an uncoated, bare-wooden dowel of approx. <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; diameter. I rotated the dowel and ran it in &amp; out several times. The dowel came out soaked with D5 cleaner so enough was applied. After final removal of dowel I gave the headphone jack another good shot of D5 then let it dry ~ 30 minutes before turning the receiver on.The sound worked right, for about the next five times I turned on the receiver. But it just failed again, returning after I shut the receiver off and turned it back on. No improvement. - SDMADDENDUM 3: 25 October 2016: A NEW LOW - After ONE DOZEN Off-then-On sequences&hellip;of <em>all</em> connected electronics&hellip;still No Sound. I was trying to play the same DVD that had been fine at noon. After a 14-hour workday we were hoping for a vid with our dinner at 22:15 but instead I ended up fighting with the Denon again and had my cold dinner later.I had tried changing program sources, switching between FireTV and my Panasonic Blu-Ray player which has never failed me, but No Sound. And this time even compressed air in the headphone jack didn&rsquo;t work.But I remembered something to try, and it got the receiver back&hellip;Some time ago, when the system seemed as close to working as it ever did, I had backed up the configuration to my computer&rsquo;s hard disk. So I now Restored that backup to the Denon, and the sound was immediately back. Restoration took about ten minutes.For me, this also restored the thought that Denon might be able to eventually correct this problem with a firmware update but for now my system still has a problem.I did contact Denon CS via online text box several days ago regarding service or replacement. Their first response came by email today and was summarily to inquire if my purchase as an &ldquo;Amazon Web Deal.&rdquo;, nothing more. No it wasn&rsquo;t. It could be a long road to getting a fully-functioning Denon receiver.ADDENDUM 4: 07 November 2016: SHIPPING FOR REPAIR -Brand new unit. No remedy has worked. Give your new Denon a good, hard workout during Amazon&rsquo;s 30-day return interval.Contact with Denon CS did get a timely and sympathetic response on the second volley. I asked about doing a cross-ship but got no response on this. I was provided a link to &ldquo;Regional Denon/Marantz Repair Centers&rdquo;, which also lists two &ldquo;National Repair Centers&rdquo;, the latter being termed &ldquo;specialized Blue Ribbon&rdquo; centers and recommended by my Denon contact to expedite diagnosis. Those two centers are: 1) Panurgy, in NJ, and 2) United Radio, in NY.UPS Ground shipping with Signature and Pickup cost me $77.15 out of pocket. UPS 3-day would have been ~$40 more for a 3-day reduction in arrival date and get there just in time for a weekend. (In my area even FedEx drop-off is a 75 mile drive. They deliver here but won&rsquo;t pick up.) Presumably I don&rsquo;t pay the return shipping but will update here on that as well as success of repair&hellip;.But despite all the hassle, when that receiver works it&rsquo;s great. I did get the ~ DTS / Neural update (Addendum 1) and Yes, it&rsquo;s a beautiful addition, you can hear the difference and it&rsquo;s what I prefer now. Also after that update, Pandora works. I&rsquo;d still buy another Denon but probably a 9.2 model, possibly an AVR-X because of the 3 year warranty vs. 2 year for my problem unit.ADDENDUM 5: 30 November 2016 11:50 PST -A: As I noted in a comment made around 19:00 last night, at that time United Radio&rsquo;s Status site still showed ~ &ldquo;Waiting for Parts&rdquo;.B: As of 11:50 today, the same report says &ldquo;SHIPPED&rdquo;! Unit is likely coming back to Oregon by Ground from New York, so it will probably be another week before I can update again as to operational status of the returned unit.- SDM- SDM</p>

<p>The tech I talked to before I bought the receiver was outstanding! The product arrived in just a couple days, although I didn&rsquo;t pay extra for shipping. I was able to get speakers, etc. plugged in without assistance, but then the mystery began. I had to the online manual to figure out how to play music; twice. I called the 800 tech support #, but got no return phone call. Second reference to the online manual refreshed my memory of how I got the music to play. Would prefer to have all that info in a paper operator&rsquo;s manual.</p>
