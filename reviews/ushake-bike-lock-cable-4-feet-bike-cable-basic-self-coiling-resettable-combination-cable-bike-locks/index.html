<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-lock">Great lock!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great lock and it&rsquo;s pretty long so you have many options on how to lock it. You also set the code yourself so you can use something you know you&rsquo;ll remember. Also, I was skeptical about the holder that it came with and that it might fall off and I wouldn&rsquo;t notice it but after some pretty bumpy rides I haven&rsquo;t had any problems!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-and-the-settable-code-is-easy-to-do">Well made and the settable code is easy to do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made and the settable code is easy to do. The cable jacket diameter is .44 inches. The internal cable is a little over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter. It is tightly coiled and springs back to storage shape after use. I bought three as it is possible to put the cables together to obtain a longer reach or lock several bikes together. This cable is a deterrent; not an unbeatable security system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="compact-with-decent-lock-for-areas-that-aren-t-high-crime">Compact with decent lock for areas that aren&rsquo;t high-crime</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use two of these locks to lock up my bike after my daily commute at the train station. I&rsquo;ve mounted both of them on my bike frame where they sit compactly. The combination dial has large numbers so you can see them pretty easily and the lock seems fairly strong (quite frankly if I left my bike in less secure areas I&rsquo;d want a much stronger lock) and the cable is thick enough to resist cutting under normal circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-wanted-to-love-this-lock-as-its-exactly-what-i-was-looking">I wanted to love this lock as its exactly what i was looking &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to love this lock as its exactly what i was looking for, but after taking it to work two of my co-workers were able to unlock the lock just by constantly pulling while spinning the tumblers. They could feel the combination and could unlock the lock in less than a minute no matter what i change the combo to. After doing some research this seems to be the case with most locks of this style. Its just not something i can trust to lock up my $1,000 bike, if it can be opened without tools in less than 1 min by a bunch of IT nerds with no locksmith experience.I would NOT recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-nice-the-changeable-combination-is-a-great-feature">its nice. The changeable combination is a great feature</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, its nice. The changeable combination is a great feature. I would use a heavy chain with padlock to lock up items that are unattended for long periods of time, but for daily use such as parking a bike at school, this works great and much easier to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bike-combination-lock-cable">Great Bike Combination Lock Cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this bike cable and received it within 2 days. It looks very solid and durable. I tried locking and unlocking it a few times and did so with ease. This is a replacement of the one I purchased from Wal-Mart, half of the price of this one, but was having such a difficult time unlocking it. With this one, I was able to unlock it every time I wanted to. I also like the mounting bracket that allow you to attach the lock cable to bike neatly when not in used. I would recommend to anyone who wants to lock his bike and not wanting to carry a key to a lock. The resettable combination is great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-like-a-great-and-higher-quality-bike-chain">seems like a great and higher quality bike chain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>so far so good.I read many reviews that their chain got cut, or even worse, came broken upon shipment. So first thing i did when i received this chain is that i tried pulling onto both ends to make sure it&rsquo;s connecting properly - and it seemed to withstand all my superwoman force. However, i dont think i will be leaving my bike unattended for extended period of time, even with this chain on. I don&rsquo;t want to risk losing it (it has nothing to do with the quality or durability of this product. I read and heard stories when high quality locks got cut in a short time frame!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-cable-lock-poor-plastic-mounting-bracket">Good cable lock, poor plastic mounting bracket</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this 1.5 months ago. The lock seems sturdy, the combination very easy to set. The dial requires firm finger torque to turn, but I&rsquo;m not counting off for that. While the lock seems to be pretty good quality, it seems as if the manufacturer used something akin to egg carton quality plastic to fabricate the mounting bracket. My bracket installed without problem, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I didn&rsquo;t overtighten the bolts, but one day I discovered the mount had slid down my center beam to the bottom. One bolt had ripped completely through the bracket, the other hole had a crack through the plastic to the edge. I sent a message to the seller today asking about a replacement.[UPDATE 2016/05/22] The seller asked for more pictures and to confirm my mailing address, presumably to send a replacement bracket. If I receive a replacement, I&rsquo;ll reinforce the bolts with large washers.[UPDATE 2016/06/21] The seller sent a replacement lock and bracket (so now I have two locks). I carefully mounted the new bracket on my seat post (before it was mounted on the frame tube in which the seat post was inserted) and faced the lock bracket rearward (before it was facing forward). I used a washer for each of the two screw heads, relying on the hex nut to act as a washer since it fits into a hex-shaped recessed hole. I slowly tightened each of the two screws til very snug, but (hopefully) not so much as to overly stress the plastic. So far, no noticeable deterioration/breakage, but time will tell. The lock is pretty heavy, which may have contributed to the breakage of the first bracket. Added 1 star.[UPDATE 2016/10/23] Around July the replacement bracket broke in similar fashion, around the screw mounting holes, despite the washers. I have resorted to keeping the cable lock in my bike saddle bag.</p>
