<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-was-easy-to-put-together-and-allows-him-to-independently-work">It was easy to put together and allows him to independently work &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this for my 13 yr old son who plays on two baseball teams. He&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;11&rsquo; 130 pounds. It was easy to put together and allows him to independently work on his swing and get a work out. It&rsquo;s akin to having a kid go out and shoot hoops by himself. He can do it for hours. A couple of things, despite my son&rsquo;s size and relatively smooth, but powerful swing, the ball never hits the net. Not really a bad thing, but just realize this. The tension is really tight on the bungees and I cannot loosen it any further to allow the ball to hit the net. Also the bungee section with the ball will eventually break. I was able to reattach it and retie it onto the clip, but you will need to buy a replacement ball section once repairs can no longer be done to the original. It&rsquo;s a good training tool for serious players who want to improve their swing. Materials are solid (minus one star for the ball section which broke around 100 swings). Would purchase it again, for the price I paid. Decent value.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-expected-swingaway-pro-xxl">Better Than Expected - Swingaway Pro XXL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the Pro XXL for 2 weeks, but the quality is obvious.All of the information I found said that the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; model was good thru age 12. My son is age 11 and he just loves baseball, so I spent the extra money to get the Pro XXL. This one can be used by grown men and professionals at that. The quality of the product surpassed my expectations. The metal tubing is much more than you would need in my opinion, but I love quality. The couplings are just as impressive in their design and material quality. I suspect that the netting is the &ldquo;weakest&rdquo; link in the whole assembly, but it is adequate I&rsquo;m sure.My son and I both love this thing. I really believe that his drive to get better will allow him to use this almost everyday. No more picking up balls and setting on the tee for me. We will still go to the cages every now and then for the real deal, but this will go along way in his development. I will need to purchase a bungee replacement at some point, but probably for next season. If you only hit the ball, this thing would last a very long time, but 11 year olds need to focus to make that happen. You know immediately, when you are not. This might teach him that.I had one small issue of damage. There is a small rubber footing that goes on the end of the bottom boom. That footing was broken off on the inside where it connects to the boom. It was still usable, but I was hoping for better than that.I called SwingAway and they sent me a new footing in 2 days just as I would hope a quality company would do. I was very pleased with their service after the sale.UPDATE - My 12 year old has not gotten much help from this after all. I should have bought a net and spent some time with him on the tee. I think this keeps me from all the bending over, but didn&rsquo;t really help my son at all, which was my intention. I think an older kid could really understand how to use this properly. Still great quality.</p>

<h5 id="good-hitting-tool">Good Hitting Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We added this to our hitting tools when our SoloHitter finally wore out (after 2 seasons of hard use).Came with a broken plastic bracket. Customer service was excellent and had a replacement to me in 3 days.When clipping the net to the frame I had the plastic clips snap like crazy. It took some patience and just the right touch to attach them without breaking. There were enough extras to complete assembly, and, again, customer service was excellent, sending me more replacements.This is a good hitting tool&mdash;I love the number of repetitions it affords. The plastic hitting mat won&rsquo;t last long if players step on it with cleated shoes. But it is not a gimmick&mdash;it offers a great way to teach players to hit balls in different locations.I&rsquo;m not sold on the quality of the device. While the metal parts are sturdy, the broken clips and bracket seem to me like they are made from materials too brittle to last long. I think we might get a season out of the bungee cords, which is fair. I don&rsquo;t foresee the frame ever wearing out, but some parts will need replacement.We had some trouble with the bungee cords coming undone and then becoming a tangled mess. As long as we are vigilant, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem that will recur. But if players don&rsquo;t notice that a bungee came loose, they can really make a mess of things with a few swings.Players can get a lot of repetitions and there are some really good drills you can do with this tool. I could hit it for hours, but today&rsquo;s players don&rsquo;t have the same patience as an old guy like me. For the ones that use it, this tool can certainly help develop stronger, more consistent hitters.It should be noted that this device cannot be easily folded to put away&hellip;and its big! You will need to leave it outside, preferably under cover, or have some space in a garage or shed for it if you want to store it indoors.Probably as good as you can get in a device like this. I liked the Solohitter better in some ways&mdash;you had a little better sense of the ball&rsquo;s direction with it and it folded up. But this one is sturdier, easier to adjust the height of the ball.</p>

<p>Every prospect needs one. I have had this for many years now. My Son uses it every day. I have gone thru three replacement parts but well worth it. The parts are reasonably prices and easy to install. I would certainly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="great-hitting-tool">Great Hitting Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Swingaway Pro XXL is very well made and fairly simple to put together. My kids were excited to get on it and really like the challenge of hitting the ball to the net. It is easy to breakdown when we have to store it. We recommend the product and the company provides great customer service.</p>

<h5 id="swingaway-xxl">SwingAway XXL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product appears to be well built structurally, however we have had several problems with the bungee cords breaking. Granted, my 11 year old son occasionaly misses the ball and hits the bungee cords but their overall durability appears to be the weak link in the system. Customer service has been great and they have been very accomodating replacing anything we have requested.</p>

<h5 id="kids-love-it-after-thousands-and-thousands-of-hits">Kids love it. After thousands and thousands of hits</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Use it for my Pony League team. Kids love it. After thousands and thousands of hits, elastic band looks a little worn, Will have to order a ball kit for it shortly. Best hitting trainer on the market. If yo want to improve your swing, this is it.</p>

<h5 id="great-batting-practice-alternative">Great batting practice alternative!</h5>

<p>I bought this item to assist in my training. I don&rsquo;t like having to commute to a batting cage each and every week only to wait behind youth baseball teams complete their BP.</p>
