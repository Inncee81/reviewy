<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="compass-is-questionable">Compass is questionable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall this is well made but a bit bulky.It would be a &ldquo;real&rdquo; outdoor product if the compass wasn&rsquo;t so small and more importantly that it was more functional. The compass component is really nothing more than a toy so it makes the overall product suffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-things-come-in-small-packages">Good things come in small packages 👍🏼</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the product and the size is great if only my wrist were smaller as I was hoping to be able to wear on my wrist but it was way too tight unfortunately but it fits nicely on my hiking backpack so the only thing I would change is to make a pair big enough to fit a grown mans wrist but overall it&rsquo;s a great product and I even got one for my trail buddy who has to do the same thing with his as it will not fit his wrist either, only a small person and possibly a woman&rsquo;s wrist it would fit fine. I give it 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼in my book any day..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-bracelet-itself-was-good-quality-and-has-some-great-features-for-camping-or">The bracelet itself was good quality and has some great features for camping or &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The packaging that this arrived in was less than impressive. It was a cheap plastic bag that had already ripped in shipping, but the shipping box was undamaged in any way. The bracelet itself was good quality and has some great features for camping or an emergency situation. The snap on the bracelet is a bit bulky and I ended up not wearing it as an everyday item because of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this should be advertised as a child&rsquo;s bracelet. It has a tiny band.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cool-bracelet-whistle-is-rather-piercing-if-u-use">Cool bracelet. Whistle is rather piercing if u use &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool bracelet. Whistle is rather piercing if u use it while it&rsquo;s not on your wrist. The compass gives u a general idea of which direction you&rsquo;re headed but it&rsquo;s not pin point accurate. The firestarter is an added bonus and gives off quite a spark. A nice overall tool for just-in-case. The bracelet is tight and I&rsquo;m a 5&rsquo;6 woman. So go get the larger size if your a man. I keep mine clipped to the chest strap of my backpack during hikes. Haven&rsquo;t had to use it yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-both-love-them-the-only-disappointment-was-that-one-of">They both love them. The only disappointment was that one of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these bracelets, one for each of my youngest two sons. They both love them. The only disappointment was that one of the bracelets did not come in the color ordered. Since they were gifts, I didn&rsquo;t have time to send the one (wrong colored) bracelet back for a replacement. Otherwise, the bracelets came on time, and my boys have enjoyed exploring the many features of the bracelets. They even enjoy wearing them as a fashion statement. At least the son who received the correct color wears his bracelet as a fashion statement. The son with the wrong color, chooses not to wear it out and about, which is sad. Overall, we are pleased with this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-absolutely-perfect-for-a-bag-clip-on">this is absolutely perfect for a bag clip on</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly as advertised. This is nothing more but it is also nothing less than it advertises to be or have. The bracelet itself is bulky and with the compass it makes for a stiff bracelet that forms awkwardly around the wrist. On the other hand, this is absolutely perfect for a bag clip on! I leave mine strapped to my backpack and it is fantastic! Love the compass and the the flint striker is very user friendly. Very awkward wearing on wrist.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stylish-useful-fits-well">Stylish, useful, fits well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received this bracelet just as promised. The small size is a good fit for my petite wrist. Stylish conversation piece when I&rsquo;m not hiking, and a useful emergency tool when I am. Note: The whistle, which at first impression seems pretty lame, will let out a piercing sound when blown with a sharp, short burst of air. Be sure to print the helpful instructions that will be offered to you in a follow up email from Makesense.</p>

<h5 id="compass-might-be-untrustworthy">compass might be untrustworthy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice 3 in 1, but I&rsquo;m not sure I trust the compass</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quite practical</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-broke">Cheap- broke</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great idea. But the compass broke off after a few uses, very cheap product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not gor an 8yo. though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too bulky</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Order was received and product is as described. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My grandson loves his survival bracelet and uses it for Boy Scouts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea">Great idea</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered for my 12 year old son. Love the idea and color. The clasp is so big though and very hard to get on and off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-after-one-use">Broke after one use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was given as a gift to my sister in law and it broke the first time she went hiking with it. The middle of the clasp broke. Not a quality product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits small. The measurement includes the snap so keep that in mind when ordering</p>
