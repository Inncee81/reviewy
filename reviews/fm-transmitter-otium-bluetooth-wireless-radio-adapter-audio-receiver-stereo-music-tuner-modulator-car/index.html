<h5 id="very-nice-device-if-you-can-reach-your-power-port-in-the-first-place">Very nice device! &hellip;if you can reach your power port in the first place</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this at a discount, blah blah that’s true - but I believe in reviews! Reviews are the backbone of Amazon!Here we go!The concise version: it works great - have no fear! If your power port is hard to reach, the T10 FM transmitter will be equally hard to reach.The longer version:I’ve got a stock 2004 Honda Odyssey with no way to plug in an auxiliary jack (without taking the dash apart - no bueno). I’ve been using a tape cassette adapter to play music from my phone but I wanted something better. I had used FM transmitters back in the day when it was a new thing - like 1st and 2nd generation iPods - so around 2003ish. They were ok, but that was about it.I’ve had bluetooth radios in my other cars and I’ve gotten used to it, when I got this van it suddenly seemed quite lacking in the audio department.So I’m cruising a discount site, come across this cool looking bluetooth FM transmitter and figure “why not?”.The first thing I noticed was that it was smaller than I had anticipated, not in a bad way, but I took some pictures to give a good representation of it’s size.It does feel very well made. Not cheesy at all.My wife and I took it out of the box and headed right out to the Odyssey to try it out. She plugged it in, it fired up, you press the main button to get it ready to pair with your device, it was already transmitting to a low band FM station which we’d dialed in on the radio, over the speakers came a movie announcer type voice that told it was pairing. My wife selected in on her Samsung 7 and off we go - started playing Pandora right from there. From the T10 you can pause the song, adjust the volume, skip to the next or previous track and it all worked fine. I tried pairing with my iPhone 6S+ and it didn’t find the T10. My wife turned her bluetooth off on her phone and my phone immediately found the T10 - so it’ll only pair with one device at a time. Makes sense. I started playing music directly from my phone and it played fine as well. I also plugged my phone it with the provided mini-jack cord like you would a traditional iPod and it playing great.At first we couldn’t hear any music when it said it was transmitting - you need to make sure the volume is turned up on your phone, in your car, and on the T10 itself.We shut the car off (which kills the power to the T10 via the cigarette lighter) and then turned the car back on. The T10 announced it was looking for my wife’s phone to pair, it found the phone, announced that it had paired and we were back to playing music. Sweet! So it’ll pair to the last known device.We played music and it sounded great, no distortion like many of the old school FM transmitters.The video on Amazon shows you adjusting the overall volume via the T10 - with your phone and car volume at fixed levels. This would work fine for many cars - but alas I have a minivan. And there is the one drawback to the T10 for my particular situation - my one power port is 1 inch off the floor, way down by my feet and behind a little trash can we have in there. It totally fits, but is in no way easy to reach or adjust.I’m not taking any stars off for that because it’s totally the layout of my van and no fault of the T10 - I’m sure it’d fit great in many sedans or any kind of car that has a power port thats within easy reach.My solution was to leave the volume up on my phone, turn the volume most of the way up on the T10, and then just adjust the volume like normal through the cars controls - works just fine.Oh yeah! I almost forgot the charger that’s built in!It also works like a champ. It’s rated at 2.1 amps which is more than enough for any phone and will even charge tablets. I plugged in my phone to the charger and back into the T10 via the 1/8” cord - I wanted to see if this would create a ground loop scenario. Nope! It sounded just fine.I texted my wife after she drove the Odyssey to work this morning…Me, “so the fm transmitter worked fine?”Her, “yep, it works pretty good (: “Me, “sweet&rdquo;So that’s about it! I was hesitant to get an FM transmitter based on my experiences in the past with them - but this one sounds great! It pairs quick and easy. It takes any type of input via a 1/8” cord (regular headphone jack) and it has a miniSD slot (I didn’t try the SD card), and it has a built in charger. What’s not to love?!If your power port is nice and conveniently accessibly - I totally recommend the T10!</p>

<h5 id="great-solution-for-older-vehicles">Great solution for older vehicles</h5>

<p>I just bought on &lsquo;06 Nissan Frontier with the low-end factory stereo - broken CD player and no AUX input. And since I&rsquo;d rather listen to a room full of screaming babies than listen to morning radio programs, I started looking into replacements right away. But all aftermarket stereos have tiny fiddly buttons and bright neon lights, so I looked into other options. I picked this one since it ha good reviews, and wouldn&rsquo;t be out too much money if it didn&rsquo;t work.It works perfectly. Turning it was easy (and there are plenty of websites to help you find empty FM channels), and it only took about ten seconds to pair the first time, and it&rsquo;s been almost instantaneous ever since. I keep the volume on my phone at about 70%, keep the volume turned down on this adapter just a bit, and the signal is crystal clear even at nice, loud volumes. I&rsquo;ve already suggested this model to a few other friends who are looking for the same thing.</p>

<h5 id="received-a-second-fm-transmitter-and-it-works-great">Received a second FM Transmitter and it works great:)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>5* when they first came in.Bluetooth setup is easy. Seems pretty good, does it&rsquo;s job connecting your phone to radio via Bluetooth.-1* couldn&rsquo;t get the TF reader to play music. Not sure if I have to make sure I only have 1 file folder with music in the sd card but yeah. Manual doesn&rsquo;t have anything to help you on that.-1* I feel like connecting your phone via phone jack vs bluetooth is clearer. So it failed the the main reason why I bought this (Bluetooth function).-1* this device just started talking in Chinese (I think). I mean it still automatically connects with my phone but it no longer says things in English (It says when it&rsquo;s connected or connecting..) and the manual doesn&rsquo;t have anything about changing language settings.Update: OtiumDirect Team contacted me and sent me a new item to replace what I have. I will update my review as I receive the package 6/10/16 +1star for costumer service.UPDATE: 06/17/16I received the replacement product from the seller and first thing I noticed was the box is different. The first one I received didn&rsquo;t have their name &ldquo;Otium&rdquo; on it but the second one has. Does this mean I received a fake item the first time?? I don&rsquo;t know. The two actual fm transmitters look the same regardless. Anyway let&rsquo;s get down to business..The TF card actually works on the first Fm transmitter I got. I found out that the transmitter don&rsquo;t support the 64g Micro sDxC, This is not mentioned in the manual. The music will automatically play when you have a card installed.. And it always start from the beginning of your playlist. The music will just go in order (I don&rsquo;t know how this Is determined) and there is no other way of cycling thru your music other than hitting the previous or next button. I think the TF card function would be best used if you have audio books instead of song playlist.In regards of the language problem I had with the first item I got, it didn&rsquo;t happen until about a week of having the Transmitter. The new transmitter I got I&rsquo;ve only used for a day so I can&rsquo;t guarantee that the problem won&rsquo;t reoccur. However, the seller did contact me the first time and mentioned that I could change the language settings by pressing/holding the circle button until the English/Chinese language option appears. Both Transmitter were unable to do this. So only time can tell if I will end up having another transmitter that will speak in Chinese or not. It honestly isn&rsquo;t that big of a problem since the only thing it does is say whether your phone is &ldquo;connected&rdquo; or &ldquo;ready to pair&rdquo;. I actually got used to the Chinese language already.And lastly, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a placebo effect but the second transmitter I received seem to have better signal. I haven&rsquo;t had to change the station or hear static noise because of lost signal on the radio station but it&rsquo;s only been a day and I need to travel a bit more into the city or away to verify this.Final thoughts: This product does what it supposed to do, connect your phone via Bluetooth/phone jack. TF card is a fancy addition but you&rsquo;d most likely won&rsquo;t be using it. Charging works. One more thing that would have been nice is if you are able to jump station like 87.7 to 98.1 with having to press the ch+ button 100x. I think you&rsquo;re supposed to be able to press the circle button then ch-+ but i can&rsquo;t seem to do it right. I&rsquo;ve only tried this with the first item that I got and failed. Maybe it&rsquo;s another defect the first one had. I have to try it on the second transmitter but I won&rsquo;t be returning to make an update for that.</p>
