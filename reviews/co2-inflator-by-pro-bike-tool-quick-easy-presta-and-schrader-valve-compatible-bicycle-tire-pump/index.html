<blockquote>
<p>One week ago I was getting ready to go to a cycling training camp (road bikes in my case) and I realized that I needed a CO2 inflator in order to quickly fix a flat on the road as all I had was a floor pump at home in order to pump up tubes. I looked around and decided to take a shot on this product and I just have to say I&rsquo;m very happy to have bought this. During this camp I actually had 3 flats (pretty rough roads, 400 miles, and some bad luck), but luckily this trusty little inflator is now my best friend, if you don&rsquo;t have one then I sincerely suggest you think about buying one. Here is my pro and con list.Pros:- It&rsquo;s extremely small and light, lighter than a hand pump, easy to put in your back pocket or saddle bag on the road.- Really easy to use on the road, simply twist to valve counter-clockwise 45 degrees and twist the opposite direction to close the tank again.- It&rsquo;s nice and stylish, most inflators I saw were bulky and ugly and this is just extremely small and professional I love it.- It&rsquo;s good at inflating, a 16g CO2 canister filled my 25mm tubes quickly and to around 95 psi at home.Cons:- The foam insulation is a little thin, your hands will still get cold without a glove, so don&rsquo;t forget that.- The little lever to begin inflating is a bit tight but I get that is for a good reason, wouldn&rsquo;t want to accidentally open the valve.Overall:This is a great little CO2 inflator and I&rsquo;ve been happy with it thus far, again the only thing I would like is thicker canister insulation. It&rsquo;s a great product and I was happy using it on the road and I know trust it. The only advice I would give to potential buyers is to, deflate and inflate your tubes with air when you get home, CO2 gets you home but it leaks much faster than air, use it for emergencies, not every day, along with that make sure you read the directions (That are quite informative by the way, albeit a bit minimalistic) and you put something between your hand and the CO2 canister, but that is for any pump. Great pump, really saved me on the road this past week (Also this does not come with a CO2 canister, do not believe that it will come with one. That is stated in the description).Disclaimer:If you found this review helpful please press the button below this review (It really helps me). I was given a discounted price on this item in exchange for a completely honest and unbiased review and that is what this is. This inflator is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The product and the company&rsquo;s customer service are both great. As to the product, I&rsquo;m not using it for tires, I&rsquo;m using it with a Growler Saver pressure cap. That item came with a Genuine Innovations Ultraflate, which essentially made it worthless. The Ultraflate let you pressurize the growler one time, then all the CO2 would leak away &ndash; and it seemed to be leaking out of the valve itself, not where the cartridge was seated on the O ring. (Genuine Innovations makes no promises on this score&ndash;it likely takes a whole cartridge to fill a bike tire&ndash;so this is not their fault, it is the fault of Growler Saver for choosing to package their item with an Ultraflate.) Having to use a new CO2 cartridge every time I wanted a little beer out of the growler = too expensive (after already spending a ridiculous amount on the cap). So then I tried a Planet Bike Airship. Same problem, plus its O ring tore easily, seemed to seat funny or something.This Pro Bike Tool inflator so far has not let any CO2 leak away, so one threaded food-grade cartridge can be used many times. Perfect! It seems to be a combination result from using threaded cartridges only (to which I&rsquo;m adding a little teflon thread tape) and, more importantly, a high-quality valve mechanism.As to customer service, Mike, the owner of the company, contacted me by email shortly after the inflator arrived to see if I was happy. I told him I was but that mine didn&rsquo;t arrive with a spare O ring like it was supposed to. I told him this is not a big deal &ndash; O rings are cheap &ndash; just tell me what size I needed so I could buy some spares. He insisted that he would mail me some&ndash;from the UK&ndash;which is excellent customer service.I have nothing but praise for this item and the company. It looks well-made and I assume it is going to last me a long time. If you want a high-quality inflator, I think this is the one to get.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really torn with this product. It&rsquo;s size an simplicity makes it a great fit for a small bike bag. It saved my bacon twice. But then the third time I tried to use it - the time I REALLY needed it - the puncturing needle fell out rendering it useless and me stranded.The two times it did work I was using a Presta valve. It worked really well. The third time was a Schrader valve and I really struggled to get it to fit. But then it broke, so kind of a moot point I suppose.I really doubt they will replace it. Not sure if I&rsquo;m going to buy another one or look elsewhere.<strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong> - not even an hr after posting this review (on a Saturday) I got an email from Mike offering to replace the faulty unit. AMAZING service!! That earns this a 4th star!</p>

<h5 id="mighty-powerful-tool-for-such-a-tiny-size">Mighty powerful tool for such a tiny size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered this CO inflator based on the reviews on Amazon. Once I received it and had the cartridges delivered, I proceeded to inflate my bike&rsquo;s tires that were flat from lack of use. I followed the instructions from the package as well as the very thorough follow up email from the vendor. I&rsquo;ve had a previous inflator that was somewhat functional, but this unit was amazingly easy to use and most efficient. I managed to inflate one tire in less than 3 seconds, not realizing how fast the contents of the cartridge came out. I subsequently took care of opening the valve slowly and it worked like a charm. I liked this inflator so much, I am buying another one as a gift. I had gone to a local bike shop and the CO2 inflators were much bulkier and far more expensive. I can carry this inflator in my pants pocket and a cartridge without it bulging or getting in the way. I definitely recommend anyone at any mechanical skill level to get one. Totally satisfied customer</p>
