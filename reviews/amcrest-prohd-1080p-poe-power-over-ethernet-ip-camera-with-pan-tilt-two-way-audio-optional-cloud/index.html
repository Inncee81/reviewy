<h5 id="this-amcrest-prohd-is-the-current-hot-setup-in-inexpensive-pan-tilt-cameras">This Amcrest ProHD is the current hot setup in inexpensive Pan &amp; Tilt cameras!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Amcrest ProHD is finally a finished, updated, and easy to setup and use mini PTZ camera.Setup is easy after you install the Amcrest IP camera tool to find the camera on the network. I changed the IP address from the one it got via DHCP. One delight for me was that the firmware on the camera is actually newer than the latest that&rsquo;s available on the Amcrest web site.I was able to add the Amcrest ProHD to Blue Iris with little trouble. Hint: Add as Generic IP network camera, Supply the IP address and select Discover. Blue Iris will find the capabilities and configure to match. Easy peasy.The 1080P video is very good quality and has an acceptably fast response over Ethernet. The field of view is wider, the colors are accurate and the detail is acceptably sharp - MUCH better than the previous products. Best of all the Pan and Tilt movement is at least twice as fast as the first two generations of Foscam cameras, which I have. The Zoom function is digital zoom, which you could do in the viewer, but it seems useful.I&rsquo;m going to install mine outdoors in a weatherproof enclosure, but don&rsquo;t tell anybody.Disclaimer: I paid my own hard earned dollars for this product at full price and GOT NOTHING for my honest review.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-poe-ip-camera-with-impressive-image-quality">Very nice PoE IP camera with impressive image quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid camera.Very nice image quality.I was rather surprised at the low light quality.The IR blasters do a great job illuminating the scene.IR light casts at least a usable 15&rsquo; of illumination.Connected very easily to SightHound imaging software.The two image streams are very easily configurable via the on-board web server.As a reference, for 11 years, I ran the software engineering department at Pixim where we developed high dynamic range image sensors for security cameras.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-nas-storage-option">Love NAS storage option</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the flexibility Amcrest ProHD storage option location to NAS device rather than force user to store data in a proprietary cloud only solution.But one thing that would make this product perfect is the addition of geofencing to make this camera more automated.Also a nice to have is flexibility to store data to multiple location simultaneously (but have work around), Alexa integration and better software interface. But love that is work with my NAS Surveillance Station and seamlessly blend with other IP camera.</p>

<h5 id="my-favorite-so-far">My favorite so far!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Amcrest ProHD 1080P POE cameras are my favorite so far for their quality picture, ease of setup, configurability and of course how well they work with Blue Iris, which is by the same company. Not to mention the price! When these were under $100 it was a phenomenal deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-cameras-i-bought-to-replace-them-were-perfect-they-were-brand-new-and-poe">The cameras I bought to replace them were perfect. They were brand new and POE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought these products before, but I have never had to deal with customer support before. You see, I install home built security systems. I ordered these products to install a system for a customer, but when the package came, the cameras seemed to be used, the plastic was removed, the cameras didn&rsquo;t have any lense protection and the box was slightly damaged. Also, the cameras were not POE. I didn&rsquo;t have time to do an RMA or exchange, so I bought two new cameras. Later that night I started the return process. The customer support was VERY helpful and prompt. I received an email later that day asking for more Details. I responded and 24 hours later, my return was approved. I sent the defective cameras back, and 24 hours after they received them, my money was back on my card. The cameras I bought to replace them were perfect. They were brand new and POE. My customer loves them. I have always, and will continue to use these cameras. Great products for a great price.</p>

<h5 id="standard-firmware">standard firmware</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is our 5th Amcrest camera. Higher resolution but with same firmware. Works well. Will be ordering the PTZ soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="compatible-with-blue-iris">Compatible with Blue Iris</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use Blue Iris video recording and this camera works well with it. I tested it for about a week and the only issue I had was one occurance of overheating but it my own fault for not ensuring adequate clearance around the base. Definitely recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought three of these about six mths ago, They are mounted outside and still working well. I did put tape over the speaker holes and they are mounted where rain wont reachEasy to configure power over Ethernet, means just a 10 base T Ethernet cable (special router tho)So far so goodVery happy with the product&hellip;</p>
