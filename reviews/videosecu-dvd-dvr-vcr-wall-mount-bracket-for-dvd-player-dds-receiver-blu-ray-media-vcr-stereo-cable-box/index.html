<h5 id="not-the-greatest-quality-nor-design">Not the greatest quality nor design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently I was able to get a good sale price on a 32” Sony TV which I bought to replace the very old 17” TV in my bedroom. Rather than take up valuable dresser top space I opted to mount the TV on the wall with a bracket that would allow it to tilt and swivel for the best angle for viewing in bed. At the same time this was going on I got a great deal on a new TiVo for my main media room to replace one that is 5 years old and has limited capabilities, but still works okay. Since the TV was to be wall mounted it made sense to mount the old TiVo on a shelf near it, again for the primary reason of not taking up dresser top space, which most people will agree also seems to be “not enough” in a bedroom.Shopping for a suitable mount for the TiVo was a challenge. Most mounts were too big and cumbersome for such a small lightweight component and I didn’t want to have the bedroom start looking like a TV studio … I wanted the electronics to be as minimalistic as possible. When I ran across this VideoSecu mounting bracket I was excited but also a bit concerned about some of the critical comments.This mount is a prime example of “you get what you pay for”. In concept it is a unique design, a mount that is usable with a variety of different-sized components. Not only is it very minimalistic, making the component appear to float in the air, but it also allows terrific air circulation on all sides of any component. But don’t get your expectations up too high. What your get for this entry-level price is a small flat plate that mounts to the wall, the main unit that attaches to the plate with four tiny screws, a bag with a couple of wall-mount screws, and a cloth strap. They include nylon ferrules for mounting the unit in concrete (do not make the mistake of assuming that these are to be used for mounting in plaster or wallboard, however).Because of the weight distribution, unless you are mounting it in concrete you absolutely must screw the metal plate securely into a stud. The device with the two adjustable arms mounts to the plate before you mount the plate to the wall, and then two plastic trim covers are slipped over the mounting plate.The design of this mount is very basic except for the overly complicated gears that permit the two arms to swing in and out in unison, so if you move one arm the other moves at the same time. Each arm is a rectangular metal tube with another rectangular metal tube that fits outside of it and telescopes in and out to accommodate components of different depths.PROSIt is easy to mount and pretty much is fully hidden by the component that rests on the two arms.CONS1. The telescoping outer tube fits VERY loosely inside the inner tube. If you pull the component toward you there’s an easy chance of it simply falling off and falling to the floor. There are slots in each tube that look like the designer intended to put some sort of locking screw in there but lost interest. Although it looks a bit funky I used my own nut and bolt to fasten the two pieces together.2. The quality of construction is, well, you get what you pay for. The entire mount is very lightweight. I would not put anything weighing more than maybe 10 lbs on it. The track has a rubber bumper to keep the component from sliding around but mine came with the rubber falling out of the slot and I had to stuff it back in. And each arm has two different sized cuts of rubber, and one of them is way too long. The endcaps of the arms are little plastic caps. Mine were falling out, they don’t fit very well.3. The two major problems are related … the mount is so cheaply made that the two arms are not the same level with each other, so one sits higher than the other. That’s the way it is made and there is no way of adjusting them. So the ONLY way to use this mount without your component listing to one side is to purposely attach the metal plate to the wall incorrectly at an angle. To do this, lay a level across the two arms and mark the mounting holes for the plate based on the arms being level. What complicates this is that the mounting plate only has two small round screw holes; neither of them is cut as a slot to permit side-to-side adjustment. Note that when you (purposely) mount the plate askew to compensate for the arms not being level that the entire back plate will look cockeyed. If you are mounting a thin component and can see the mounting plate you may not like that look.4. The cloth strap to fasten the component down is downright silly. I get the impression that the designer lost interest when he saw that the telescoping arms kept falling out and rather than come up with a fix he threw a “seat belt” into the box to prevent components from falling. It looks cheap and terrible and is not a good solution.There aren’t a lot of similar mounts on the market and the few I saw are more expensive and seem to be even more poorly made, so if this is the type of mount you like you’re going to have to compromise.This mount is available in either black (shown) or white. I bought both colors; one for my new bedroom TV setup and the other to hold my WiFi router in my living room so I can mount it high up for maximum signal distribution.For the price this is an average product that is functional, if not a great design. If quality is less of a concern than price, go for it.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-cable-box">Perfect for my cable box.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was easy to install. I was looking for a shelf to put my cable box on that wasn&rsquo;t too expensive. This was a great price and is working well. I needed something to fit above my kitchen TV. Did not have a lot of space and I could only use the top screw. The lower screw was behind my TV. Hopefully, it will hold up. It does stick out a bit far ,but I have no traffic in that area.</p>

<h5 id="for-what-it-is-not-perfect-but-not-bad-for-the-price">For what it is, not perfect, but not bad for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for a uverse receiver under a mounted TV. I didn&rsquo;t want to buy the higher dollar one, since this was just in our Master and not a game room or family room TV.The installation wasn&rsquo;t bad, but the screws and anchors provided were pretty terrible, did not fit right at all. And they provided stud screws, but no screws for the dry wall anchors&hellip; weird&hellip;The reason I gave this a 3, is because it&rsquo;s not a typical wall mount like I&rsquo;m used to seeing in the higher price range, where they have a place to feed wires through. This one has no place for that, so the wires will be off the side, shown above it or below it.If you don&rsquo;t care about a little showing its a not a big deal, I didn&rsquo;t really mind that much.The BIGGEST reason I gave this a 3 star, is because one of the arms that are supposed to hold the device is bent down a bit, so the device that sits on it is not totally level, which is a bit irritating. Over all I&rsquo;m semi-satisfied with it. The seller themselves were great, fast response, fast shipment, so nothing against them.</p>

<h5 id="a-steal-for-9">A Steal for $9</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For less than $9 I&rsquo;m surprised these work as well as they do. I bought two. One is holding up a small secondary cable box and the other is in the living room holding a DVD player with a full size DVR on top of it, and a sound bar balanced on top of that. Not much in the way of cable management but it prevents needing a piece of furniture to hold those components&hellip; so it&rsquo;s well worth the little money you pay for it. The bracket is heavier robust steel and attaches with two screws, and really needs to go into a stud to be sturdy. There is a small piece of rubber in a track down the tops of the arms to keep the components from scooting around and a strap in the package (which I didn&rsquo;t use and probably should have given that I have cats who could knock everything off with one good jump). It&rsquo;s surprisingly sturdy for what it is and should work fine provided that you mount it well.EDIT: When I mounted mine, I laid my level across the arms and marked the screw holes to drill the pilot holes in the wall once it was level. You will more than likely end up with it off-kilter if you try to use the side of the bracket itself as the leveling edge.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-ok">Just OK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not bad. Not great. The worst thing is just what you&rsquo;d think. The stuff you sit on it isn&rsquo;t all that stable and the strap they send you is kinda worthless. Use velcro and its functional. Also, the sheet rock anchors and screws they send you are big. They are bigger than the bolts that hold up my TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="couple-of-problems-but-otherwise-functional">Couple of problems, but otherwise functional.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s built well, and was relatively easy to install. I&rsquo;m dinging it for two reasons:- The included drywall anchors have no rim, so it just ended up getting pushed through the wall. Luckily I had some better ones handy.- The shelf is not perfectly perpendicular to the mount, so after mounting it and checking level on the back portion, my shelf is crooked. This is pretty annoying, kind of a &ldquo;you-had-one-job&rdquo; situation. I can live with it, but if I had it to do over I&rsquo;d have checked this out and probably returned it for something better-built.These things aside, it holds my blu-ray player on the wall. Whee!</p>
