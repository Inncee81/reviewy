<p>amFilm Premium Anti-Glare/Anti-Fingerprint Protectors are made from superior quality 3-layer PET film, and specifically designed to fit your Fire 7 2015 device. The Anti-Glare top coating not only reduce the glare but also reduce the fingerprints from daily use. In addition it effectively protects the screen from daily scratches, dust and scrapes. With a self-adhering surface, the screen protectors are designed for easy application and zero-to-minimal bubbles during application. A squeeze card is also included to remove the occasional bubble easily.</p>

<p>Works with:
Fire 7 2015</p>

<p>Contains:
2xScreen Protector , Micro-Fiber Cleaning Cloth, Plastic Squeeze Card, Hinge/Dust Removal Stickers.
Color:
Anti-Glare/Anti-Fingerprint
Application:
Each of the screen protectors contains 3 layers of PET film. The first and last films are mask films, where the stickers are affixed. The actual screen protector for your device is the film in the middle. Please use the stickers to remove the mask films (NOT the stickers themselves).
Warranty:
30 days Money Back Guarantee
Lifetime Replacement Warranty</p>

<p>Note: The Matte material may produce a pixellation of the screen clarity, as this is the natural effect created by the Matte (anti-glare) frosted texture.</p>

<h5 id="2-replaceable-fiber-tips-black-black-first-of-all-this-is-a-great-product-the-above-stylus-doesn-t-seem-to-work">2 Replaceable Fiber Tips (Black/Black)]] First of all this is a great product. The above stylus doesn&rsquo;t seem to work &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>MEKO&trade; [2 in 1 Precision Series] Disc Stylus/Styli (2 Pcs) Bundle with 4 Replaceable Disc Tips, 2 Replaceable Fiber Tips (Black/Black)First of all this is a great product. The above stylus doesn&rsquo;t seem to work quite well on this product. I&rsquo;m not sure that if it&rsquo;s because of the fiber tip or if it&rsquo;s because of the three layer protection of the protector. It does seem, however; that a rubber tip stylus works well, but you will hear that squeegee sound, which to me is like nails on a chalkboard. I have the new kindle fire 7 &ldquo; 5th gen released in 2015. I made sure to select the correct device because each kindle is made differently.But here&rsquo;s some tips:****************************************************************<strong><em>Make sure to select the correct device and color</em></strong>******************************************************************1. Read the instructions, and understand them before actually applying this product. There are about six or seven steps and on first glance it looks complicated. Well, it&rsquo;s not2. IF you do have air bubbles pop up make sure you swipe from the middle of the device to the outside edges. Also, make sure you work on a hard, clean surface away from fabrics. I did get a couple of fiber particles behind my protector and it left maybe one or two tiny bubbles, but I was also working on a semi dirty counter.3. The matte will scratch a little but they are fine lines so they shouldn&rsquo;t disrupt any activity on the device.4. As for the fingerprints. This is excellent. I have very oily hands for some reason (I don&rsquo;t use lotions) and without this protector you could see every swipe or selection I made, all built up on the screen. But with this it still shows fingerprints but they are hardly visible unless you are actually looking for the prints AND it is a one swipe and clean deal. Sometimes there might be a spot that is tougher to get off but its just a little more rubbing.5. Be sure that when you clean the screen for the initial installation, that you DO NOT touch the screen again. You will have more bubble that there is time to fix. Basically, a fingertip print can add about 10 small bubbles to your device. I&rsquo;ve done this before and I have learned from it.I do have to say that I&rsquo;m satisfied with this product as an overall, there are some things that I don&rsquo;t like but they are more personal complaints like my stylus not wanting to function on the screen with the protector on. It&rsquo;s skipping across the page and just not reading right. And that when I&rsquo;m watching a movie you can kind of see how the picture is either really a pixel or fuzzy look, it&rsquo;s not clear but I think that is for all matte finishes.Anyways, make sure to follow tips 1, 2 and 5. If done properly it can be a hassle free process. GOOD LUCK!!The first photo is with it perfectly clean. The second is when I did a scroll or push for an app at regular finger pressure. Maybe you can see the fingerprint. Also, I tried looking for the small scratches at the top of the device and it is barely visible, there is also a small bubble up there in the left corner.</p>

<h5 id="would-buy-again">Would buy again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall I am happy with this product. It does cut down on the reflective glare and fingerprint smudges, which is the main reason I bought it. I realized I&rsquo;d be sacrificing some screen sharpness, but overall it&rsquo;s not bad. It was a little difficult to apply, and even in a damp, clean area there still was some dust that got in at the edges, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone but myself can be blamed for that. I should have watched the video and dampened the cleaning cloth first. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars, and making it a perfect product IMO, is that the matte finish makes text a little grainy and harder to read by refracting the light coming from the screen. It&rsquo;s a little like looking through frosted glass. But again, I guess that is to be expected from what is essentially a piece of frosted plastic film. Still, overall I&rsquo;m happy with it and would recommend it, especially if you like to take your Fire outside or in bright light, which causes the factory screen to act like a mirror.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed on two 5th generation Kindle Fire. Used the hinge method with only one problem on each of them. Speck of dust got on the edge of both tablets. Simple fix. Used tape to peel the protector back &amp; wipe the speck away. No bubbles. Have to really look to even notice there&rsquo;s a screen protector. Really reduced the fingerprints. I also installed them in the bathroom after running the shower for a couple of minutes to reduce the dust. I cleaned the screen first with Screen Kleen. This stuff is amazing for TV&rsquo;s, PC&rsquo;s, Laptops, DVD&rsquo;s etc. <a href="http://www.screenkleen.com/index.html">http://www.screenkleen.com/index.html</a></p>

<h5 id="easy-install-best-ever">Easy install best ever.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install following video instructions. Use the play and pause while watching video. That will give you a slow step by step procedure. That way you will not forget a step. Make sure to follow first step of placing no 2 strip correctly. I ended up with one small speck which was my fault. The only product problem was that it would not where long one edge of the screen no matter how I tried to pres out the protector. Was not very noticeable thus not worth replacing with second protector. The deficiency prevented me from giving a 5 star rating.</p>

<h5 id="best-installation-instructions-ever">Best Installation Instructions ever!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After buying at least a dozen different screen protectors, all impossible to repositon or get the bubbles out so I had to toss them. I ran across this one. I wish I could include a photo, but it is not an option. However I found the illustration instructions included on one of the detailed pictures under the product picture. Once you look at it you will agree with me. It is so simple to understand and follow that I cannot believe anyone else has not thought of it. I will never buy any other now!</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to replace my kindle in late November and ordered some screen savers at that time. They were horrible and showed EVERY fingerprint so I ordered these as they had a matte finish. They are perfect! They had GREAT installation instructions AND NO fingerprints. I love them!!!</p>

<h5 id="good-screen-protection">Good screen protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used one of these when I got my kindle and liked the way it went on so when I got a fire I wanted one for it. Simple to put on and easy enough to get any air bubbles out. Good product.</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-camper">Very Happy Camper :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So glad I bought this product. The screen on my Kindle Fire showed every fingerprint, very annoying. I&rsquo;ve had this screen protector on for almost a week and there aren&rsquo;t any fingerprints, I haven&rsquo;t had to clean it! Absolutely love it!I didn&rsquo;t have any problems putting it on either, very easy if you follow the instructions that come with it. I also watched the video, which helped too.</p>
