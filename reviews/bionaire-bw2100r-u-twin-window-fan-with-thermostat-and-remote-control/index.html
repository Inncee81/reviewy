<h5 id="bionaire-honeywell-comparison">Bionaire / Honeywell comparison</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed two window fans, and couldn&rsquo;t decide between this one and the Honeywell HW-628 Honeywell HW-628 Enviracaire Twin Window Fan so I ordered one of each. Trusting the Honeywell name, I expected it to out-perform the Bionaire. After trying them both, I&rsquo;m returning the Honeywell and getting another Bionaire.Materials:Right out of the box, the Bionaire is much more attractive and modern-looking. The plastic is very sturdy and bright white, and construction is solid while still being light-weight. I notice no odor.The Honeywell&rsquo;s material is more flimsy, and somewhat translucent and yellow, reminding me of cheap Chinese toys from the 99¢ store. The seams audibly pop and rub against each other when the unit is moved around, and it has a strong solvent odor.If I kept the Honeywell, I&rsquo;d be tempted to hide it if company came over. Not so with the Bionaire.Mounting:My windows are the slider-type, so I need to mount the fans vertically and remove them daily when the weather gets hot. Both fans are reasonably stable mounted vertically, and both can be mounted simply and quickly without removing window screens by trapping attached tabs within the window frame. I have not tried to mount either permanently or with removed screens, but both have hardware to do so.Controls:The buttons and switches on the Bionaire are smooth, large and respond to the lightest touch. Each fan has its own switch to select between intake and exhaust, and one button toggles digitally through all speeds (3-2-1-A3-A2-A1) for both fans simultaneously. (The &ldquo;A&rdquo; settings automatically turn the fan on and off at your pre-selected temperature.) The final two buttons control both the optional timer and temperature settings (digitally). It also includes a remote control that can adjust the temperature settings and fan speed. I haven&rsquo;t tried the remote, it just it just isn&rsquo;t very useful for me. I turn the fan on when I put it in the window and off when I remove it. I can&rsquo;t think of any reason I would want to adjust the speed or temp settings from a distance, although other users may. The remote would be more useful to me if it could control the intake/exhaust selection. For example, if the fan is running on intake and starts to suck in parking lot exhaust or my chain-smoking neighbors&rsquo; stink, I&rsquo;d like to quickly switch to exhaust from the next room. Maybe this feature could be added in future generations.I find the controls on the Honeywell difficult to use. Each fan has its own knob to control speed (a plus), but their too-flat, too-smooth shape is difficult to grip and much torque is required. Definitely NOT arthritis-friendly. Two primitive switches select between intake and exhaust and, frankly, these look like an afterthought to me. Clearly, little effort was put into the control panel design. One additional knob crudely adjusts the temperature setting. It has no marks on it at all; presumably one must wait until the room is too chilly and then turn the knob until the thermostat switches off and expect that it will continue to switch off at that unspecified temperature in the future. I can&rsquo;t help but shake my head at this bit of advanced technology. There is no remote.Operation:The Bionaire motor is silent, and its solid construction prevents any rattles or buzz. All I hear is air moving, and even on the high setting it&rsquo;s not distracting. In fact, I find the sound soothing. Both fans must run at the same speed at the same time, the only independent adjustment is Intake/Exhaust. When using the temp or timer settings, the fans switch on and off silently with no clicks or beeps to disturb one&rsquo;s sleep.The Honewell let out a strained buzz the second I turned it on, eliciting grimaces from both my husband and myself. Unfortunately, the buzz continues through all fan speeds. Also, the left-hand fan revs up and down, almost pulsating, when it&rsquo;s running, which made me nervous. The solvent odor was stirred about the room while the Honeywell was running, and I assume this would fade with time, but I&rsquo;d rather not live with it at all.Air Flow:I&rsquo;ve used the Bionaire almost daily for a week now. My living space is 13&rsquo; wide by 30&rsquo; long, with windows at opposite ends. I can run the Bionaire on medium speed Exhaust at one end of the room, open the windows at the opposite end, and feel a gentle, comfortable air flow moving throughout. I am THRILLED with this. It&rsquo;s exactly what I was hoping for. Plus, if I happen to be standing near the fan when outside stink starts to come into the room, I can quickly switch to Exhaust mode and within seconds the room smells fresh again. I&rsquo;m surprised every time at how well this works.The Honeywell&rsquo;s air flow is more restricted, although the rotating front grills do allow you to adjust their direction. Set on Exhaust, even the high speed doesn&rsquo;t stir the air at the opposite end of a 30&rsquo; room, and set on Intake it creates a strong current that I can&rsquo;t quite aim in a direction that makes it comfortable. Honestly, even if it perfectly circulated the air in my entire home, it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth living with the noise and smell (and, forgive me, the ugly).Maintenance:One benefit of the Honeywell is that the front grille is removable for cleaning, where it&rsquo;s not on the Bionaire. Aside from the remote functions, this is the one thing I would change about the Bionaire if I could. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to cleaning this thing once our abundant field dust has its way with it. And yet I still wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for the Honeywell.</p>

<h5 id="not-good-for-a-house-application">Not Good for a House Application</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important you order this fan for the proper usage. Although I realized it was a small unit, I was hoping that it had enough drawing power to at least pull some cool air through our windows at night in our two-story Chicago bungalow house. It didn&rsquo;t. It would probably work fine for a small single-level apartment or dorm room but NOT a house.On the plus side, it is very quiet, appears to be well-built, and worked exactly as specified. The problem is that Bionaire seems to have a policy of NOT providing technical specs for some or most of their products and this fan is no exception. Their website provided no details like RPM of the fans or even more importantly, CFM (cubic feet per minute) ratings so I could have assessed whether it would have worked without going through the hassle of ordering and returning it. Poor policy on their part.I&rsquo;m going to order one of the 16&rdquo; single motor window fans below instead which I&rsquo;m hoping will have much more draw for my application. I can&rsquo;t fit the Air King 20&rdquo; whole house fan, which would be ideal.Air King 9155 Storm Guard Window Fan, 16-InchLasko Electrically Reversible Window Fan, 16 Inches, 2155AAir King 9166 20&rdquo; Whole-House Window Fan</p>

<h5 id="i-can-open-my-window-and-still-breath">I Can Open My Window and Still Breath</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in a townhouse and I would keep my window open in the living room so that the breeze could cool my entire home. That was until my chain smoking neighbors moved in. For over a year, I kept that window closed (I also suffer from asthma) because when I left the window open my home would smell like a bar. The last straw was in April of this year when my neighbors were smoking at 6:30 am and the smoke traveled up to my 3rd floor window. ENOUGH!I came to work that day, logged onto Amazon and purchased the Bionaire Twin Window Fan. The fan is terrific. I installed it and the first time in year I was able to open my window. I put the fan setting on level 3 when the chain smokers are their deck and level 1 during the other times.The complaints I&rsquo;ve read regarding the temperature gage doesn&rsquo;t really apply to my situation. The delivery and the condition of the equipment was excellent. This is a good buy and I would recommend it.</p>
