<h5 id="works-great-for-our-backyard-theater">Works Great for our Backyard Theater</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this screen for a backyard theater and even though I use a Cheap LED low lumen projector, the screen still catches every bit of it&rsquo;s light. Very easy to set up and take down, I just hang it off my deck, and the soft close feature is very nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-but-the-distortion-is-annoying">It works&hellip; but the distortion is annoying.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has quality construction and functions well. The only reason I won&rsquo;t give it more stars is because after a week the ripples and waves have doubled. It still functions fine but the waves in the screen distorts the image. If you are on a budget and don&rsquo;t have the option of a fixed screen or the money for a tension pull down this will work in a fix.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen">Great screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is awesome! It is my first screen but it is great. I purchased the 120&rdquo; screen so I can move it when needed but it is as big as I could fit in my room. It provides great color and can be viewed off to the side as well. For the money you can not go wrong with this screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="had-it-for-a-week-or-more-now">Had it for a week or more now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice screen. So far we haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it. Other than the smell when you first open it. If you&rsquo;re really sensitive to odors I would highly suggest cracking a few windows and leaving the screen open until it goes away. We left it open for a few hours our first night and by the next night the smell was almost completely gone. This was a very nice upgrade from our smaller screen that was on a tripod. Worth the money for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="id-really-like-to-give-it-more-stars">Id really like to give it more stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Id really like to give it more stars, I mean it pulls down and rolls up and the image looks goods on it quality wise. HOWEVER&hellip;.right out of the box the screen has a V wave in it starting from the bottom center and going up each side to the corners. When an image pans across it right you will see that wave in the image. Distracting and unsightly! Even when doing stuff in the projector menu the menu has a wave in it. I have contacted elite screens via their website and a week later still have not received a response. So not only is the screen poor quality customer service is not all that good either. Be sure to Google V wave in pull down screen and you will see what im talking about.I really really want to like it but for me the wave in it throws off the viewing experience..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-flat-distortion-during-panning-shots-games-also-avoid-for-short-throw-projectors">Not flat - distortion during panning shots / games. Also, avoid for short-throw projectors!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Missed the little warning about short-throw projectors&hellip; wish I hadn&rsquo;t. Even with a relatively horizontal projection path, the waves on the screen are distracting and ugly. The housing and screen material seem fine, everything works as described.Docking two stars: One for not making that short-throw warning more prominent (and more clear - &ldquo;not recommended&rdquo; is not strong enough wording). Another because, regardless of it&rsquo;s intended use, the screen is not anywhere near flat. Even when projecting straight onto the surface, these waves cause annoying distortions during panning shots or when playing games.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen-for-the-price">Great screen for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really pleased with this screen so far. I bought it for an outdoor pool party this summer, along with a cheap $150 DVD quality projector. I wasn&rsquo;t going for anything high end, just something to play some music videos on while the party was going on. After the pool party I also put some hooks in the ceiling in my kids&rsquo; room (ages 2 and 4), and they love having little movie nights with huge movies playing in their room. It is a good distraction for them, especially when we have multiple families over with lots of kids, as they can have their own little movie room going separate from the adults.It is light and easy to move around between the two spots that I installed hooks, although I am 6&rsquo;1&rdquo; so that helps. My screen is pretty smooth and flat, I have to look very closely to find any kind of waves as others have reported. I guess each screen can be different, but I am happy with the one I got. Unless I look from the side with a light source at an angle, I can&rsquo;t see any waves. I certainly don&rsquo;t have any waves that I can notice looking straight at the screen or while watching a video, and after 6 months haven&rsquo;t noticed any changes. Maybe if I had a high end projector and this was my main source of tv or movie watching, then I would invest in a more expensive screen to be certain I had a very flat surface, but for my casual use this screen works great. It rolls up and down very smoothly, but makes sure to assist it back up and not let it go, or it will retract very quickly and violently. It does have the very strong &ldquo;chemical&rdquo; smell the first few days, but it has gone away now and I don&rsquo;t smell anything even using it indoors.Overall a very solid screen for the price.</p>

<h5 id="great-screen-1">Great screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is great! If you&rsquo;re a first time buyer like I am I would totally recommend getting this screen. When I received it, it came in 2 different boxes. The first box was damaged like something poked it and the 2nd box inside it was undamaged. When I took the the screen out of the second box it was in perfect condition. When i pulled the screen out it had no waves or wrinkles like others have said but just like some other reviews state it does have a smell to it when you pull the screen out but it has dissipated after time. So if you are looking for a beginner screen I would recommend this one.</p>
