<blockquote>
<p>The interface is really weird, but once you get the settings all sorted, this is a really fantastic setup. The quality is perfect. Viewing the cameras on my laptop is super convenient. The mobile app isn&rsquo;t the best of quality, but I love how quick and easy it is to check if anyone is home.Just a few days after setting it up, it caught someone coming into our yard and siphoning gas out of our trucks. The video was good enough to identify the man and now he is jail.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-1080p-picture-quality-software-documentation-could-use-upgrades">Excellent 1080p picture quality; software &amp; documentation could use upgrades.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am an electrician that often installs security systems and recently found this brand, so I put a 1080p system to the test on my latest installation. Most of my customers prefer to have a closed circuit system with no internet communications enabled, so I will have a somewhat different perspective than most other reviewers.PROS:1) The picture quality for the 1080p system is phenomenal. I try to talk most people into getting the best picture quality for the money since most if not all of the cheaper systems are inadequate, and in my experience most customers are not very happy with the picture quality once they go through the time &amp; effort. Both my recent customer and myself were very impressed with Amcrest, and it was a bit of a shock seeing the night vision quality practically look like it was daytime at midnight (given enough ambient light, otherwise it is black&amp;white in full infrared mode).2) Installation is basically all about strategic camera placement &amp; adjustments and running cables, but it is basically all plug and play after that. I would highly recommend using the quick start guide as well as enabling the navigation bar, then it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get things going from there.3) Packaging is well done and there is little doubt the items would get to you in good working condition barring any packaging damage along the way. Everything looks and feels like it is solidly built with some heft to it.4) No wi-fi functions to bother with. Yes, this is a pro because wi-fi generally has poor picture quality and has to be one of the most insecure communications technologies available, but you can always look for a different system with wireless if you want someone to hack your system and see what you see. You also run this risk by enabling internet communications, but not as much as with wi-fi.CONS:1) The Manual is a poorly written Chinese translation into English and very choppy with little coherence. If you are a programmer it might be OK, but setting advanced parameters will likely prove frustrating and time consuming to most. If you use the quick start guide more and rely on calling customer service to walk you through any issues, the manual issue can largely be negated.2) There are some bugs and glitches in the software when using advanced functions such as motion detection and alarms. I tend to use these functions little if at all, and I usually keep it closed circuit by not connecting anything to the internet, but again this issue can largely be negated by contacting customer service, and keeping it simple.Overall I&rsquo;m very impressed with this system for the money and will continue recommending it until something better comes along. Most of the consumer oriented or DIY style kits like this still have issues, especially with the software, and there will be some major advancements in this style of technology over the next year or two that will hopefully work out most of the bugs, but without resorting to spending thousands on a professional system, I think it&rsquo;s a great value that will continue to impress.Update: For those who find the ventilation fan operation to be too loud, it can easily be upgraded with one of these&hellip;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/noctua-NF-A4X10-FLX-5V-Noctua-Fan/dp/B00NEMGCIA?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00There">http://www.amazon.com/noctua-NF-A4X10-FLX-5V-Noctua-Fan/dp/B00NEMGCIA?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00There</a> is also a CPU fan, but the ventilation fan replacement usually handles most of the noise complaints and takes about 15-20 minutes if you are a handy type.</p>

<h5 id="very-pleased-updated-jan-2017">Very Pleased (Updated Jan 2017)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After years of using stand alone IP network cameras and ispy I finally broke down and spent the money on this NVR and 4 camera kit when I moved into a new house. I have been running the system <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for about 6 months now with no issues. So far I&rsquo;m only using three of the four included cameras, all of which are mounted outside. I bought my first Amcrest IP camera in March 2016 (IPM-721S HDSeries 720P) and was immediately impressed with the quality of both the camera and video. A month later I bought a second camera of the same model. Both cameras are still running at the time of this writing (Jan 2017). Previously I had used IP cameras from D-Link and those cameras never seemed to last more than a few months of constant use before the video quality degraded and became almost useless.Over all I am very happy with this system and I definitely would buy it again and I would recommend it to others. But there is one thing I have to point out.. the user interface is pretty bad, it is clunky and unintuitive. I have been working in I.T. for over 10 years so when others said the user interface was confusing I figured they were probably just not tech savvy&hellip; well that is not the case, it really is. It will take some time but once you figure out what settings do what you will be fine but when you first start out you are going to be searching though various menus and screens quite a bit. One bit of good new though is that once you learn the Amcrest software it&rsquo;s pretty much the same on all the cameras I have seen from them.Pros:-The quality of the 4mp cameras this kit came with are excellent-The 2TB hard drive has plenty of space (still hasn&rsquo;t overwritten old video after 4 months of use)-POE is very convenient and works perfectly-The included network cables are plenty long (x2 50ft x2 100ft)-Viewing on my Android phone is as easy as scanning the QR code and putting in my passwordCons:-The user interface is unintuitive and takes time to figure out-Adjusting the Sensitivity and Threshold settings so that the cameras don&rsquo;t pick up bugs and tree shadows but still see slow moving people is tedious-Have to install an Amcrest plugin to view the system via web browserSome Tips:-For some reason the factory video settings on Amcrest cameras are not set very high so make sure you turn up the resolution and frame rates on the camera settings to the highest number your cameras will allow and save. Four the 4mp cameras in this kit I am using the following video settings H.264H compression, 2688x1520 resolution, 20 frame rate (FPS), CBR 4096 bit rate.-You can add other model Amcrest cameras to this NVR even if they are not plugged right in to the NVR. I have 2 other Amcrest cameras on my home network (IP3M-956E and IP2M-841) that I added to the NVR.-Since this camera system is accessible from the internet make sure you keep the firmware updated and use a STRONG password. All it takes to view the cameras on your smart phone is to scan the QR code on the NVR (which is just the serial number), that take you to a prompt for your username and password, once you enter that info you (or anyone else) can see your cameras. Make the password you use a long, complex, and random as it will be the only thing keeping someone from seeing your cameras if they can guess your serial number.A note on cooling: There are no fans in the NVR so if you put this somewhere where there is no climate control (like I did) you will need to provide cooling. I used a small fan from walmart and put it at the back corner of the NVR. The fan keeps the box cool to the touch and it has never locked up or shut down due temps, even when it got into the 90s in the garage where mine is.I bought this system for several reasons but my main reason is that my driveway connects to a private farm road and I have issues with people using my driveway despite many signs. Thanks to this camera system I now have license place numbers and if I ever see someone twice they are going to be reported to the police for trespassing.Review updated Jan 17, 2017.</p>
