<h5 id="oh-no-i-just-lost-it">OH NO - I just lost it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, this will be my second order for the X5C-1 Quad. Even though I&rsquo;ve flown many types of planes in the past, this is a different animal all together. By the way, this is not a toy in spite of what it says on various posts. I just flew mine into the woods never to be seen again about an hour ago. I started getting cocky and that is a bad thing to do with this quad. The Syma X5C is one of the best quads on the market. I&rsquo;ve tried 4 others only to send them back. This beats all the other I&rsquo;ve flown due to its smooth flight, ease of control and a pretty long battery life. You do need extra batteries though. My advice is to read the manual and practice many times before you go above 40 or 50 feet and that&rsquo;s flying in an open field. The hardest thing to learn for me is turning the quad 90 or 180 degrees. You have to think in those directions when you fly it so that is the thing I need the most work on. A lot of people and even companies call them &ldquo;Throw-Away-Drones&rdquo;. Primarily due to the affordable price. If you lose or crash one like I did this evening, you&rsquo;re not out a lot of coin. It still hurts to lose one though. I promise that you won&rsquo;t regret buying this quad. It will fly within 10 minutes right out of the box. Just don&rsquo;t get cocky and practice in a large and I mean large open field many times before you tighten your area of flight.</p>

<h5 id="for-the-you-cant-go-wrong">For the $&hellip;.you cant go wrong.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is stable, on low and high modes. The video quality is pretty good too. Would make an amateur feel like a pro with how easy it is to fly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-can-t-begin-to-express-how-much-fun-this-little-quadcopter-has-been">I can&rsquo;t begin to express how much fun this little quadcopter has been</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok.. I can&rsquo;t begin to express how much fun this little quadcopter has been. It&rsquo;s larger than you might thing, take a look at some of the other pictures people have posted. The controller is plastic but feels solid. If you have an old wireless router there are instructions on how to upgrade the controller for more range. Ok, back to the quadcopter &ndash; It is very responsive to the throttle, push it up, and its going to zoom up and away. Seriously practice outdoors or in your garage at first and only give it a little bit of gas. Once you get the hang of hovering a button on the controller can initiate an automatic flip which the kids love. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun zipping this around the yard at around five feed letting the dog chase it. The lazy man&rsquo;s dog workout. Despite being caught a few times it looks like new.The camera is pretty fun to use too, although half the time I&rsquo;m not sure if I turned it on as there is no visual identifier that it&rsquo;s recording. It comes with a tiny data card and an adapter so you can plug it into your USB. A word about taking this baby up high. Please be aware that it will easily go as high as you want it to go BUT you risk either losing signal OR it getting caught in a gust of wind and going off course.For the later, what invariably happens is you get cocky and thing you can correct and bring it back, but the controls can get easily confused and with wind it can get turned around, so don&rsquo;t feel afraid to bring it down sooner than you think. Funny story, I was getting pretty good, getting little cocky and decided to take it out in my backyard at night.Did I mention it has lights on the bottom? Pretty cool right? Well I took it out, it was winter. It started to drift into my neighbors yard and I got a little flustered and gave it too much juice which took it up and then boom.. strong wind. Next thing I knew it was four houses down on the opposite side in a neighbors lawn (suspected) that I didn&rsquo;t know. So I did the only thing I could do.. pack up my cute six year old daughter and knock on the door asking if we could look for our drone we lost. If you don&rsquo;t have kids and buy one of these a dog will work well in a clutch situation like this.I also bought a replacement part kit. I recently burned out one of the motors and am glad I had the replacement part.</p>

<h5 id="great-starter-drone">Great Starter Drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the bad reviews below me. It DOES come with a battery charger, and the other 1 star review claims his son flew it away&hellip;.well duh! If you can&rsquo;t fly it properly it WILL fly away.This is a 5 star &ldquo;starter&rdquo; drone. The camera works, and takes mediocre pics and videos. Definitely nothing to frame or post on youtube, but still it&rsquo;s a cool little camera and it even comes with an SD card and 4 extra propeller blades.Very easy to get out of the box and start flying, I had mine in the air in 10 minutes. Controller is easy to get the hang of and after 5 minutes of flight time I was really starting to get the hang of it.The battery life is 5-10 minutes and there is only 1 battery included. Order some extra batteries! A couple extra batteries is like $7 on Amazon, you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>

<h5 id="great-fun-quadcopter-that-can-take-the-abuse-that-comes-with-learning-how-to-fly">Great, fun Quadcopter that can take the abuse that comes with learning how to fly.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, this is a great little quadcopter. My son got it as a first drone and I bought the JJRC H31 on sale to fly with him. The X5C-1 has a bigger battery (7200mah) and more power in the motors. I like the H31 a lot - (very durable) but the X5C-1 is a superior flier in my opinion. It lasts longer than the H31 due to the battery, and it is quite fast. My son has gotten very good with it. Flips are effortless and you can combine flips with flying stunts easier than the H31. The only thing he has broken on it is the battery cover (small tab came off) and the power switch broke off on an impact. We can still use a small screwdriver to turn it on and off. It has taken quite a few crashes and it keeps on flying - and flying well. I have run it into trees, and the house (accidentally) and my son doesn&rsquo;t bat an eye. It is very durable. As a first drone used to learn how to fly, it is a fun and recommended unit. If it were slightly more durable (plastic battery cover, power switch) I would give it 5 stars. I almost gave it 5 anyway. A great little unit.</p>

<h5 id="outstanding-flyer-outstsnding-value">Outstanding flyer, outstsnding value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife bought it as a Father&rsquo;s Day gift for me. For two years, It sat in a corner untouched until about 3 weeks ago. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much fun this little quad is to fly.</p>

<p>Great Product would purchase again.</p>

<p>Bought one and it the first time flying it, it took off and did not come back. I don&rsquo;t know where it went, but it did not return to me!</p>

<p>Awesome, wish i learn how to drive it so i don&rsquo;t have to go to the neighbors house to pull it from the tree&rsquo;s</p>

<p>NICE</p>

<h5 id="a-great-starter-i-got-one-for-me-and-2">A great starter, I got one for me and 2 &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great starter, I got one for me and 2 others as gifts. If you think it looks like fun it is and a great learner that can take the crashes and keep on flying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent starter quad opted. Excellent seller customer support. Lots of fun. God video from onboard camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-starter-drone">A good starter drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A good starter drone. Low cost and relatively simple to operate. Due to the small weight, wind is a problem. So you can only fly this drone on days with low wind.</p>

<h5 id="app-won-t-work">app won&rsquo;t work</h5>

<p>Can&rsquo;t connect to wifi. camera flashes red and green, then stays solid green. no wifi network is ever created for my phone to connect to.</p>
