<h5 id="connect-two-bluetooth-headsets-at-once">Connect two Bluetooth headsets at once.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To use this device you must connect it through one of the 3 ports. You have an optical port , aux port or RCA ports. I used the optical port. You will also need to charge the device or leave it plugged in. Now I tried to leave it plugged into the TV USB port but every time you shut the Tv of you have to pair the device again. So I suggest you find a wall USB plug. You do have the option to just charge the device then unplug it also since it has an internal battery. This battery will last 15 hours of play time. You can also connect two Bluetooth headsets at once.To power on the device hold it for 3 second and it will light up. Once that is done you then tap the power button twice and it is in pair mode. You then hit pair mode on your headset and listen for it to connect.The device works well and easy. You can mute your tv and still hear your headset. Which can be good if you have your office PC in the same room. It could also come in handy for those who want to watch TV in bed and not bug the significant other. You will need a headset that can adjust its own volume. I added adhesive to the back and stuck it to the back of my tv.</p>

<h5 id="up-and-operating-in-5-minutes">Up and operating in 5 minutes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Connected from the 2nd Audio Out RCA Jacks on my Sony STDR-DE935 AV Receiver into the AUX jack on the Ubitek device in TX mode, and had it working within 5 minutes of arrival Paired with Bose QC35 wireless headphones (with the aid of the Bose Connect app), and will add a second connection to a BT speaker. Then when there&rsquo;s a pledge drive on I can connect a phone or iPad via the AUX input and listen to the uninterrupted stream with no begging breaks. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;s great and I may get more of them.NOTE: I already had an available micro USB power cable and a 2-foot RCA-to-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch stereo jack cable, so I didn&rsquo;t use any of the accessories that came with the unit, and using the 2nd Audio Out on the receiver was a snap. YMMV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-well">Worked well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure seemed to work OK with my Cardo ScalaRider PackTalk unit. I route my motorcycle&rsquo;s radio to the Bluetooth transmitter and paired/connected to the PackTalk&rsquo;s second A2DP channel. Every time I rode on a recent 4,000 mile trip, I was able to listen to the Harley radio in my helmet communications set. The 15 hour battery life meant that I never turned the unit OFF. While I rode it was charging and at night while I slept, it had plenty of capacity to last until the next morning when I rode again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product, I looked over so many Bluetooth devices for a home stereo and from the reviews and quality of product picked the Ubittek and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Easy to set-up and the sound is great and works great in the Conference Room where I have it. I do wish the cords were a little longer for the system and shelving we use but it all worked out fine.Very well packaged, received in 2 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-works-as-outline">Great product. Works as outline.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this at the gym to link into the stereo system to teach fitness classes. Works great. Easy to use and has great reception. I got tired of always having to plug my phone into the stereo system which prevented me from moving from workout station to workout station when teaching a circuit spin class.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to plug into my camper T.V. to link it to my Blu-tooth stereo; WOW!!! I plugged the audio cable in and used the USB charge cord on the same T.V. to keep it charged. Pushed the button twice and that was it, paired and the sound is amazing. No lag in sound vs. movie action. Note: Do know that your device that you want transmitted controls the level of sound sent. To clarify, set the volume on the T.V. at about normal listening, then adjust receiver volume. This operator error on my part held me up for about 5 minutes. I have only tested it once and have not watched a whole movie with it yet but so far so good. Now I can hang my camper T.V. outside and enjoy a movie under the stars with no speaker wires to worry about. Hope this helps future buyers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-item">Excellent item !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have just begun using this item and already I really like it. It can transmit for at least 20 to 25 feet I have not tested its maximum yet but the sound is great and the transmitter stays connected via Bluetooth and uses different connectors for different purposes all included with this product. Using it to transmit digital Bluetooth optical signal from my new MacBook to my home theater receiver and it is excellent. The new MacBooks no longer have an optical digital output through the headphone jack so this product is perfect to replace that and it&rsquo;s wireless to boot! Nice job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this to play music from my Ipad and or Iphone plugging into the CD jacks of my old stereo system&hellip;works like a charm and sounds great. I have also tried in in my car plugging into the audio jack in the car, also works great. And I have tried this unit in output mode from my TV to my Sony bluetooth headphones&hellip;.again works great with good quality and the ability to control the volume from my headphones. Highly recommend this unit.</p>
