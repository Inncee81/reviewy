<h5 id="sweet">Sweet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty great. I have used it in a couple of shoots since I got it, its very consistent and very bright. I&rsquo;ll upload some pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-light-for-the">Awesome Light for the $$</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Check out this video review of the CN-160. I highly recommend using this light. It was a lifesaver in a low light wedding event. I mainly shoot video, so this light is awesome for the $$. This light is so bright, I&rsquo;ve even used it as a fill light in various lighting situations.Update:After using the light a little longer, I&rsquo;m still a huge fan for the price. However, I should mention a couple of cons (all of which are minor imo).1. The tungsten filter is too orange for my tastes. So, if you are relying on this light because of the tungsten filter, you may want to reconsider or make your own filter. There&rsquo;s a nice little slot where the filters slide into.2. The construction is plastic, however, I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say it&rsquo;s cheap plastic. I feel comfortable with the construction, but don&rsquo;t expect it to be indestructible.All in all, this light still gets 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="fast-output-bright-light-and-a-lot-of-control">Fast Output, Bright light, and a lot of Control</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast setups! I have used pro gear, and I have used these. I have to say I was really impressed with what I was able to achieve in such a short amount of time with these lights. They are light, easy to move (when on stands), and easy to control.The first still is from a night shoot that we had zero ambient light for. I setup a 300W softbox in the back, and lit mostly with about 4-5 of these LED lights. The dimmers are a must, because sometimes you just need to bring out a little texture in the background, but not the whole deal.The second still shows how the light performs as an edge/back light, I also used a second light to bring out the ambulance, and that&rsquo;s where the dimmer comes in handy. His key was two 300w soft boxes. (I&rsquo;m not saying this is an amazing lighting setup, but, just wanted to show how they can work in a professional environment - they are so quick and simple.)The 3rd and 4th stills highlight a cool effect that I just recently started doing, which is pointing these lights right into the camera just off frame to give flares when you&rsquo;re just shooting fairly static and inactive B-roll. With a heavy tungsten light, this would be an arduous ordeal, but, because the lights are so light, portable, and dimmable, it takes a few minutes to get a really cool effect.If I had to do it over again, I would have sprung for the F970 batts for just a little more peace of mind. I have about six of the F550s, which, are good for about an hour, but, if you&rsquo;re doing any sort of serious shooting and you&rsquo;re trying to move quickly, and then you have to hold up the interview because you need to change out a batt on your lights, that&rsquo;s pretty bad.Excellent overall though, when used correctly. I have three in my light kit at all times.</p>

<h5 id="would-ve-rated-5-stars-however-updated-on-3-31-14">Would&rsquo;ve rated 5 stars, however&hellip;. (UPDATED on 3/31/14)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item last year and used it once until yesterday (3/28/14) - the 2nd time I used this. Disappointingly, the on/dimmer dial broke as I barely placed pressure on it when turning it on. I can hear a small piece rattling inside the unit. I&rsquo;m very careful with all my equipment and the light was always housed in the cardboard box it came in so I know it wasn&rsquo;t thrown around or misused.And as my title indicated, I would&rsquo;ve rated this 5 stars if not for the defective part which is probably the most important part of the item, so I give it a 1 star rating. I can no longer turn the light on or off and obviously can&rsquo;t use the dimmer function. I guess the only good thing is that I can still use it at full power when all the batteries are installed, but I have to take at least 1 battery out to turn the unit off.I&rsquo;m very disappointed because it was great during my initial use.UPDATE:I took the unit apart and fixed the dial so that it now works. It was an easy fix so I guess I&rsquo;ll give it a true rating of 4 stars now. I&rsquo;ll leave off a star just because the dial will probably come loose again eventually when it shouldn&rsquo;t have after 2 uses. I&rsquo;ll also leave the 1 star rating so that more people will likely read the review and know how to fix it if they should ever encounter the same issue.To fix, remove all batteries and remove all 4 screws from the back of the unit. That will remove the front cover lip (for lack of a better description) to give access to the 4 screws on the corner of the led light panel. Remove those 4 screws and you&rsquo;ll be able to lift the led panel along with a 2nd panel to gain access to the dial. What happened with my unit was that the screw that held the dial in place unscrewed itself and the dial came off it&rsquo;s spool. Luckily the screw didn&rsquo;t fall out of the unit so I repositioned the dial, replaced the screw, and tightened. Over-tightening will cause the dial to not turn very easily, but if you under-tighten, you take a chance of the screw coming out eventually. Anyway, replace panels and all screws.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-light-for-video">Fantastic light for video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This video light looks similar to one I paid $100.00 for over a year ago except it has been improved. This video light is much brighter and the adjustable bracket has been &ldquo;beefed up&rdquo; and holds steady. The original versions arm would flop down over the course of the evening but this one doesn&rsquo;t do that. I shoot weddings several times a year and I find that if I use two of these on stands to light up a dance floor and use one on my video camera I never have a lighting problem. This company has the best price that I have found, enough so where you can afford to purchase several to light up dark areas of your video shoot. A great light and a great deal.</p>
