<h5 id="elite-screens-100-manual-pro-slow-retract-great-for-a-budget">Elite Screens 100 Manual Pro Slow Retract - Great for a Budget.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Your average-married-family guy review:I recently reconfigured my home theater room with a projector. Not wanting to break the bank since I haven&rsquo;t used projectors before I decided to go with the Elite Screen 100&rdquo; Manual Pro Slow Retract Model. Installation was a breeze as I had another help me mount and simply used two heavy-duty drywall anchors (rated at 45lb a piece) to attach it to the ceiling with hooks.The quality seems great. The housing is nice and seems sturdy. After mounting, I was able to pull it down easily and it will automatically hold at certain points so you don&rsquo;t have to re-position your projector after every pull-down. Slow retract works as described but was a little louder than the demo-video portrays. The screen itself seems to be made of a great material - great whites and a black border that kills any light overlay. The downside is - yes, there are some waves in this screen (this isn&rsquo;t a tension-ed screen) and they seem to be getting a bit worse&hellip; mainly towards the bottom middle of the screen. They aren&rsquo;t huge at this point and when the movies are playing or the games are going - I can&rsquo;t really notice them. However, if the picture is bright and contains a lot of white - they can be noticed. Over overall happy with my purchase for the price. I think it&rsquo;s a great screen for the money and would have 5 stars for sure if there were no waves.Pros: Great price/value, nice bright screen, good materials, slow retract looks niceCons: Some small waves in the center bottom, slow retract is a little noisyUPDATE! 3/6/15 - I contacted Elite Screens tech support after doing some research online and they confirmed that using an electric hair dryer on low-to-medium heat ON THE REAR of the screen (not the front or you could damage it) could remove most/all of the waves. Keep the hair dryer approx. 2-3 inches away and keep it moving constantly in small, circular motions. This removed most/all of the waves in my screen. I&rsquo;m added +1 star for their great support (talked to a live person immediately with no waiting) and the fact that the waves were resolved. It&rsquo;s not 100% perfect but then again its a non-tension-ed $150 screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a cheaper, interim screen while I work on my home theater where I ultimately will be installing a larger (120&rdquo;) ceiling-recessed screen.The case is a nice pearl-white metallic paint on the metal case with white plastic endcaps. It&rsquo;s an attractive looking case for the price.It was easy to install, I chose to wall mount it using the keyhole slots in the endcaps. It can also be hung from the ceiling using the two loops on the endcaps.Now on the the important thing, the actual pull down screen&hellip; Unfortunately I the first one I received had a couple of fairly pronounced wrinkles near the bottom of the screen, equally spaced about 12&rdquo;-18&rdquo; from the pull down handle, right above the weight bar. It&rsquo;s hard to tell if the package could have been tweaked during shipping, or if it came that way from the manufacturer. It seems like it may have happened while testing in the factory? When you were sitting any distance from the center-line of the projector to the screen, the wrinkles were very noticable so I called Amazon and had them ship me a replacement. The replacement was also wrinkled, but maybe only 40-50% as bad as the first one so I decided to keep it (unless the wrinkles bother me too much in the next couple of weeks). I will try to post a picture or two if I get a chance.The material is the MaxWhite FG (fiberglass backed). Maybe the added stiffness of the fiberglass is what contributed to the wrinkles in the screen (and unfortunately that&rsquo;s what the fiberglass is trying to prevent)&hellip; In the areas above the wrinkles, I will say that it is nice and flat.The image looked fairly good, nice and bright in a dark room, contrast was good (my projector is the Epson 8350 - I got a good price during Amazon&rsquo;s Cyber Monday sales). I just can&rsquo;t say that it is more than 20% better than shining it on a bare, white-painted wall. But like I said this was purchased as an inexpensive interim screen and I&rsquo;m hoping the ceiling-recessed screen will not have the wrinkles (The more rigid case along with not applying force to the center of the screen bottom will hopefully help it to not develop the wrinkles before it gets to me.)If there had been no wrinkles, I would have given this a five-star review, but because it looks like it&rsquo;s just too difficult to get this from the factory to the consumer in perfect condition, I&rsquo;m giving it three&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-good-screen-for-the-price">This is a good screen for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good screen for the price. The main improvement I would like to see is making it easier to pull the screen down to the same vertical position each time it is opened. As it is each time you use it you need to do 1 the following readjust the projector, pull it down several times hoping it retracts the perfect amount to line up with where you adjusted the projector last time or more likely, a bit of both. I have pulled it down to a marker in hopes this would help, but the amount it retracts after you let go before staying open isn&rsquo;t consistent. Fix that issue and this would be a 5 star screen.</p>
