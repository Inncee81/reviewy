</ul>

<p>Color:Black
The YI Lite is the perfect sidekick for anyone that loves to capture the best of life. Don’t be fooled by its compact design, we’ve still been able to integrate a 2.0” LCD touchscreen, build it with a Sony Exmor Image Sensor and include the very latest Hi3556 chipset, to give up to 130mins recording time in 1080p/60fps. The integrated 2.0” LCD touchscreen gives you intuitive control over the cameras settings, and with 320x240 resolution you can clearly view your footage while recording. Advanced connectivity capabilities gives you seamless connection to your smartphone so you can upload your footage straight to your favorite social media platform.</p>

<h5 id="a-true-quality-camera-excellent-hardware-software-and-end-images-and-videos-can-t-find-a-better-product-for-the-price">A true quality camera: excellent hardware, software, and end images and videos. Can&rsquo;t find a better product for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Yi Lite after making the mistake of getting sucked into buying another camera with &lsquo;all the accessories&rsquo;. That other camera was more like a toy, with the end video/picture resolution looking like it was taken on an old android phone or something. That camera went right back into the box and was returned. After that, I did a bunch of research into sub-brand action cameras, and the one that continually comes to the surface as being the real deal with exceptional image/video results was the Yi camera line. For my needs (family/trip recording), the Yi Lite was the perfect fit. All that comes in the box is the camera, a battery, and a USB cable. That&rsquo;s it for hardware. The instruction manual was quite good, too. Upon receiving the camera, it was notably more substantial than the other one I bought. The operation is simple, fast, the touch screen on the camera is incredibly responsive and quick, and I was up and running in seconds. I downloaded the app, and connected it quickly. I was then prompted that there was a firmware update for my camera, so I downloaded it and updated my camera (via wifi). The app works smoothly (the other camera used some 3rd party app, and it wouldn&rsquo;t connect). What I really wanted from a camera was something that took gorgeous photos and videos at 1080p60fps, and this one does it wonderfully! Any larger format, for me, would be too big and heavy of files to work with (and I&rsquo;m not sharing my stuff on a big screen&hellip; just family TV&rsquo;s or computer screens).One thing I wanted to note about my first-time experience in buying an sub-brand action camera is that I was surprised how much rebranding of the same generic product that is going on in the market. Much like many &lsquo;smart watches&rsquo; on the market, these cameras are the same components and housing with different brands and packaging. Whats even worse is that some of the cameras (or so I read) don&rsquo;t actually take the MP rating they state, but instead (due to their sensor hardware) they take a lesser number of physical pixels, and their software chops those into finer resolution&hellip; so it technically is the higher pixel rating, but from a lower resolution photo. Now that&rsquo;s sneaky&hellip; and nothing I want.The Yi Lite isn&rsquo;t even a sub-brand camera. It&rsquo;s from Xiaomi, a top-tier Chinese electronics manufacturer. It&rsquo;s just lesser known by mainstream consumers (like me). I am so thankful and appreciative of man online reviewers (here on Amazon, through blogs, and through YouTube) for giving me the information I needed to make a smart choice in an action camera. For just under $100, there is nothing else out there on the market that comes even close to delivering the quality and value that this camera does. Super happy customer on this end.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-quality-action-cam-that-has-to-be-compare-only">This is a great quality action cam that has to be compare only &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a great quality action cam that has to be compare only with top tier cameras like gopro, the image and video quality is stunning. It was really easy to pair via wifi with my iPhone and the Yi app is pretty good. The camera manages the white balance and EV perfectly. For the people that dont like the fisheye effect, the camera has an option that eliminates it completly.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-camera">I love this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this camera. the video quality is really good. better than my other action cams i bought in the past. my only wish is that the audio bit rate would be 128kbps, other than that the camera is awesome. i would definitely recommend this camera and i plan on buying more in the near future. I&rsquo;ve already posted youtube videos i made with it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-our-needs">Perfect for our needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The order was shipped and received promptly. The camera works as intended. we have only used it for a short period of time to record AAU basketball games. The wide-angle view is perfect for this and the compact size of the camera is perfect for long-term use and is easily transportable.</p>
