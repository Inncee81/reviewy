<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="i-love-the-5-star-screw-driver-bits-but-i-hate-the-case">I love the 5 star screw driver bits but I hate the case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set of drill bits and case is for me a love and a hate relationship. I own several sets of these as I have multiple DeWalt tools that I use all of the time. The bits in the kit and the other accessories are good quality and overall this kit is a great buy. I rate the bits as a 5 star item and they are well worth the price of this kit. Getting all of these bits and accessories for this price is really a good deal.The plastic case that the bits come in is touted as an industrial-strength case that is strong and durable. While the outside of the case is nice and it is a strong case, the mounting of the bits into the case is nothing but a pain. It motivated me to make this video. Ultimately you will have most of the bits and accessories in the case and not snapped into their storage positons. I cannot ever see any construction worker or contractor ever taking the time and having the patience to mess with the poor mounting design inside of this case.I rate the bits as a 5 star item and the case a 3 star item. Combined the rating is a 4 star. My little video shows how the inside mounts work or don&rsquo;t work. DeWalt is a great company and I have invested a lot of money into their 18 VDC power tools and accessories. I just wish they would make a better case design. I don&rsquo;t have time to play with the bits when I have a lot of work to do.</p>

<h5 id="great-selection-of-screws">Great selection of screws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great selection of screws. Only complaint is the bits are hard to get in and out of the case. Otherwise a good set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-screwdriver-set">Nice screwdriver set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this Dewalt 45 piece screwdriver set for my husband. It was a great price so I couldn&rsquo;t pass it up and what man couldn&rsquo;t use more tools? This set includes phillips, sqaure, slotted and double-ended bits. The case is very nice and durable. We found when putting the bits back into their slot it was much easier to slide them in from the top or bottom than pushing them back in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-lot-of-the-same-size">A lot of the same size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the same size bits. I thought I was getting a bunch of screwdriver bits of different sizes and that&rsquo;s not the case. Each row is one different size bit but all the same size so not the variety i was looking for. Wish that would have been clarified in the product description when I ordered as I would have gotten a different set. The bits themselves are good quality though. The magnet in the bit extender should be stronger and the container bit holders should be more flexible to allow for easier removal and putting back of the bits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-deal">Great deal!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently bought this for a gift to my husband. He is trying to buy everything dewalt since it&rsquo;s a great brand. I bought this so he could have every bit he needs. I was very pleased with this purchase and so is my husband. He was very excited to get this. All the pieces were there and work fine. It shipped very fast and safe.The only problem i had was the case. It doesn&rsquo;t hold all the pieces very well and I know soon they will all get put in another tool case. But overall it&rsquo;s a great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this set, both for the selection of bits, and especially the magentic bit driver holder, which makes it super easy to position and start a fastener, particularly in tight spaces. The locking case is very durable. It comes with a ton of #2 screwdriver bits, which I think is a bit of overkill even for the most loss-prone of us, but overall this is a very nice set and I&rsquo;m very happy with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-dewalt-basic-drill-head-set-many-unique-features">Best Dewalt basic drill head set. Many unique features.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All the tips you could ask for with a really well made extension tip for the smaller heads. You basically get all the standard sizes in medium lengths for directly inserting into your drill then the same heads pluss many more specific sizes in small head to use on the previously mentioned extension piece for the small hsads.Case is sturdy compact and impressively organized with a slide lock. After the first 2 or 3 uses you&rsquo;ll no right where your perfect head is for the job. Also instead of the standard hard plastic clasps to hold pieces in place you get a soft rubber with Dewalt that hugs it in the middle then slides in the slot. In other words. No snapping off plastic clasps leaving the heads loose in the case.All the heads for basically any job and sized well enough that they don&rsquo;t wear out or strip the bit head or screw head easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice set for around the house use. I&rsquo;ve put several things together using it, and always found the bit I needed. There are a few repeats of the most used bits, but for me that&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m not sure this is the best set for a contractor, but for around the house projects, it works perfectly. It fits in the bag that came with my Dewalt drill, which is an added bonus so I can keep everything together.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>just what my husband wanted and expected.</p>
