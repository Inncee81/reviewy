<h5 id="use-over-the-ear-style-during-running-great-sound-for-bluetooth">Use over the ear style during running! Great Sound for bluetooth.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I never had the jaybird bluebuds x so I can&rsquo;t compare it to that.I purchased mine at bestbuy(to get a geeksquad warranty) about a few weeks ago and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. Jaybirds has a lifetime sweatproof warranty. Here is my 2 cents:Sound quality is great - As good as my $100 bose soundtrue earbuds(for a regular joe, it is more than enough). I use to watch movies on my mac and netflix on my roku and it sounds great.Noise cancelling is passive(enough to zone in but safe enough to hear surroundings while running).Battery life is as advertised - Ran for a week running 5-7 miles daily, watching movies without charging. Gets approximately 8 hours.Connectivity - No issues except for old bluetooth devices. Disconnected once but it was my old 2009 mac(so I bought a bluetooth dongle). Switching from one device to another is very easy. It can only get connected to one device.Fit - The smallest bluetooth earbuds money can buy in the market(I tried a lot ie backbeats go2, jabra sport, etc and they all look like I have a jawbreaker in my ear). The fit is great but when I ran it started to fall off with the sweat and all. The solution: Over the ear fitting. It has been excellent for me during running. I use the under the ear for leisure activities/plane trips because I can secure it around my neck when I temporarily remove them. Just google jaybirds on how to clip it properly(clips included in the purchase), it takes 30 seconds.Things I hate - the case. OMG. Very poorly designed. It is huge and a pain to open/close. The comply eartips has irritated my ears, so I use the silicone(included too).I disagree with other reviewers about not sounding loud enough, I never had a problem with it using spotify, pandora, itunes and even just watching from my mac. IT&rsquo;S ALL ABOUT THE PROPER FIT. Ignore the reviewers that says the sound is tiny, they are not fitting it correctly or they didn&rsquo;t clean their ears.TLDR: Just buy it if you&rsquo;re looking for a bluetooth earbud with good sound quality and comfortable fit. I spent too much time purchasing and returning the cheaper ones. Wear it over the ear when running. If the fit is not great, just return it but give it a shot :)UPDATE(10/24/2015): After 2 months of use, the X2 has been amazing. No lost connections(not even once!), plus the new iOS displays the battery life now. I have been training for a half marathon and using it for traveling, it has not failed me. Devices used: macbook pro late 2011, ipad air 2, tomtom spark cardio + music, iphone 6s.UPDATE(3/7/2016): The X2 has been solid. I have now been using it on a daily basis - I just discovered audiobooks lately and wear the X2 to listen to them on my way to work. Still no spotty bluetooth connections despite heavy use. I am using it for everything, I think I already got my money&rsquo;s worth. Battery life has not worsened after a few months.</p>

<h5 id="not-suited-to-small-ears">Not suited to small ears</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small eared people: you may be disappointed. For perspective, I am an adult female. And now I know I have small, flat ears (or these earbuds lead me to believe so)My Bose earbuds are much more comfortable. These are still a touch too big, and I cannot use the foam tips at all &ndash; it&rsquo;s uncomfortably painful in minutes.The ear wings don&rsquo;t reach my ears either. I put them on as directed in the video, but I cannot put the buds into my ears far enough for them to properly reach (even if I reach back and pull my ear up, as you would for foam hearing protection plugs).The silicone tips are slightly better than the foam ones, as they are thinner, but I don&rsquo;t think I could wear these for even a whole movie. I really would prefer that the bore was smaller, or tapered, or something. I&rsquo;ve had them out for several minutes and my ears still feel funny.The sound is good, especially for bluetooth headsets. It&rsquo;s not comparable to corded sets, but most people already realize this. Not too bassy, very balanced.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-running-and-workouts-earfins-didn-t-work-for-me">Perfect for running and workouts - earfins didn&rsquo;t work for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these headphones along with a cheaper version to see if there was a difference in fit and quality. The other Bluetooth headphones I purchased were the TaoTronics Wireless 4.1 for $30.99 on Amazon. I gave the cheaper version five star review as for the price, the quality and fit were decent in conjunction with the inexpensive price. The Jaybird you definitely get a more luxurious feel as it is more comfortable in ear and crafted towards the runner/active lifestyle being sweatproof. However, the things that made me take off one star was the price as it is rather expensive as well as the earfit fit which is not completely suitable for my ears despite the customization. It is just up to ones ear so if these will fit your ear they would be perfect for ones active lifestyle.Pros:-long usage: 8 hours-sweatproof-customizable: memory foam ear tips and secure-fit ear fins-over or under ear fit: perfect for changing from commuting or working out-good connectivity to music: used with Spotify and have not had a problem with disconnection-great sound qualityCons:-expensive-ear fins may not work for everyone: depends on ones earUltimately try these Bluetooth headphones out if you want quality sound and multi usage for commuting/leisure as well as working out. If the earfins work for you then these are a great buy.</p>
