Wilson Electronics — Mobile 4G — Cellular Signal Booster</p>

<p>View Larger
Improve the clarity of cell phone calls and reduce the number of dropped calls while on the road with the Wilson Mobile 4G Cell Phone Signal Booster. The product includes everything you need to capture a weak cellular signal, transmit it into your vehicle, increase the cellular signal strength, and improve the performance of your cell phone, regardless of which carrier you use — 3G and 4G! The result is improved cell phone reception, fewer dropped calls, and increased data transmission rates while traveling.</p>

<p>View Larger
How It Works
When traveling, you often encounter areas where the cell phone signal is weak or blocked due to distance from cell towers or obstructions such as buildings or hills. The Wilson Mobile 4G Signal Booster captures a weak cellular signal, transmits it into vehicle, and boosts the signal strength to and from your cell phone, resulting in better call quality, fewer dropped calls, and increased data transmission rates.</p>

<p>The Mobile 4G uses three primary components – an outside antenna, the signal booster, and an inside antenna. The outside antenna, which is mounted magnetically to the roof of your vehicle, captures the weak cellular signal from the nearest tower. It then transmits the signal to the signal booster inside your car, which increases the signal strength before transmitting it to the inside antenna. Your cell phone then picks up the improved signal from the inside antenna and transmits back to the inside antenna, through the signal booster and to the outside antenna, sending a stronger cellular signal back to the cell tower.</p>

<p>Who It Helps
The Wilson Mobile 4G Signal Booster is especially helpful for people who rely on their cell phones while traveling. These individuals can range from sales professionals to truckers to people who travel alone and want better cell service in case of emergencies. A stronger cellular signal allows you to stay in touch with clients, vendors, and the home office, or get access to emergency services in remote areas. You also get improved data transmission, enabling you to get the information you need between locations. The Mobile 4G increases cellular signal strength on 3G and 4G networks across all major cellular carriers.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s Included
The Wilson Mobile 4G comes with everything you need to start benefiting from improved cellular reception in your car or truck, including:</p>

<p>An outside antenna that mounts magnetically to the roof of your vehicle. This antenna captures the signal from the nearest cellular tower.
The Mobile 4G signal booster, which is placed inside your vehicle and connects to the outside and inside antennas to increase the strength of inbound and outbound cellular signals.
An inside antenna, which is placed inside your vehicle and connects to the Mobile 4G signal booster to transmit the stronger cellular signal to your cell phone.
12V power supply
Connecting cables
Simple installation instructions and contact information for additional support.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-as-expected">Works as expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this.We have horrible reception where we live - generally 1x or older, and 1 bar; no 3g or 4g.When I set the phone on the antenna &ldquo;block&rdquo; (the flat antenna), I get 3 bars of 4G/LTE. It definitely does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. We used to get &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; 1x from Verizon, and now, up to 3 bars of 4G. Hanging it&rsquo;s vehicle antenna off a floor lamp in the living room (just to try it out).We used to have problems even when downloading pictures w/text messages, and when the phone&rsquo;s near the antenna, there are no issueslYour phone will need to be close to the flat antenna (2-3 feet, tops, it seems?), hence the 4 stars instead of 5, which is &ldquo;ok&rdquo; for vehicles - as others have mentioned, you&rsquo;ll want to keep your phone near the included antenna, and use your bluetooth so you can walk around while on the phone.</p>

<h5 id="very-impressed-after-1-year-i-wasn-t-at-first-though">Very Impressed After 1 Year! I wasn&rsquo;t at first though.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok it&rsquo;s been about a year and since I bought used I was skeptical because at first it appeared this didn&rsquo;t gain a thing for service however that&rsquo;s all behind me now. This unit works and works very very well. At times it may only show a bar of improvement however the bar doesn&rsquo;t appear as much to some people but in terms of decibels it&rsquo;s enough to keep LTE active and fast. What then happens is if LTE drops off you then you most likely will have 5 bars of 3g service most often. What it does is attempts to gain LTE first but in the background 3g which is more prevalent in all areas is boosted to fall back on.In my case I&rsquo;m usually never out of LTE service where I used to only have it for spurts out on my farm area. I&rsquo;ve never ever dropped a connection since I&rsquo;ve used this in fact where I used to drop on my drive into the city at an area where I enter a long stretch through an Indian Reserve. Now that stretch I see a low of 2 bars LTE.</p>

<h5 id="wilson-4g-mobile-booster">Wilson 4G Mobile Booster</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Wilson Mobile 4G cell booster to use with my RV. The goal was to use my Verizon iPad 3 as a wifi hotspot, providing Internet access when camping in state and national parks.The Wilson booster includes a magnetic antenna indented to mount to the middle of a car&rsquo;s metal roof. My RV has a fiberglass top, so that proved to be a problem. A metal roof is required both to magnetically attach the antenna, but more importantly to provide a &ldquo;ground plane&rdquo;. I resolved this problem by purchasing a 14&rdquo; steel pizza pan at Target, then clipping the antenna to the middle of the pan. This setup was then placed on the roof of my RV, on top of the air conditioner.The Wilson booster also includes an internal antenna that transmits to the iPad. After configuring the iPad as a hotspot, I found the best results by placing the iPad on the RV&rsquo;s floor (as far away as possible from the roof antenna) and spacing the iPad about a foot away from the Wilson internal antenna.During my most recent camping trip I tested this configuration at several campgrounds. Some campgrounds had a great LTE signal and the booster was unnecessary. Other campgrounds had no cell signal at all and the Wilson booster didn&rsquo;t provide any help. Two campgrounds had marginal signals, these are where I found the Wilson booster a help. At the first site in Montana I was able to boost a weak cell signal to the point where it was somewhat usable as an Internet connection. The booster definitely helped, but the connection was not great.At the second marginal campsite (Larrabee State Park in Washington), the results were much better. Here I found the Internet to be completely unusable without the booster, and pretty darn good with the booster turned on. Here are the results of my Internet speed tests:Six speed test with no booster, the iPad showed 1 bar of LTE:0.76 mbps upload / 0 mbps download0.70 mbps upload / 0 mbps downloadtest failed0.73 mbps upload / 0 mbps downloadtest failedtest failedSix speed test with the Wilson booster, the iPad showed 3 bars of LTE:9.0 mbps upload / 0.08 mbps download6.9 mbps upload / 0.12 mbps download6.2 mbps upload / 0.22 mbps download8.6 mbps upload / 0.26 mbps download6.4 mbps upload / 0.37 mbps download10 mbps upload / 0.43 mbps downloadConclusion: In the right situation (where there is at least a marginal LTE cell signal), the Wilson Mobile 4G booster is a big help. What is unclear is how often one finds themselves in this situation. I&rsquo;m very much looking forward toward Wilson releasing a better antenna for this booster. At the time of this writing, their only option is the tiny 4&rdquo; antenna included in the box. I&rsquo;m hoping that there will be available soon, a high gain antenna with an integrated ground plane that can be permanently mounted to my RV.</p>

<h5 id="much-improved-signal">Much Improved Signal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great here in Montana. I have good signal on 95% of my travel time now&hellip;.. compared to 75% of the travel time before I installed this booster in my pickup. I am also using the taller antenna too. It works great but it falls off my roof if I drive into my garage too fast. The signal will be better if you can get the antenna closer to the center of your vehicle roof as well.</p>

<h5 id="booster-is-fantastic-get-a-better-wilson-external-antenna-though">Booster is fantastic, get a better Wilson external antenna though.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they have changed their name to WeBoost as Wilson already had a long reputation. I&rsquo;ve rarely been disappointing in Wilson products, having many of their amps and antennas over the years, and this one is no exception.One tip, ditch the little antenna and get a better Wilson outside antenna. Antenna is everything, whether you go with a mag or a hole mount, you need something more substantial than the little one that comes with it. I have mine paired up with an NMO mounted to an L bracket on my roof rack. I&rsquo;ve traveled over 15,000 miles already this year in some rural areas and the ONLY place I didn&rsquo;t get a workable signal, there was no signal AT ALL to begin with on the Verizon map, just a white hole. It won&rsquo;t give you a boost if there isn&rsquo;t a signal to start with, but it definitely will help if it&rsquo;s just weak. I am in some very rural areas too. I run mine with both a phone and a Verizon mifi card, and keeps a 4G signal in some amazing places, and even 3G or 1X in places you would expect nothing at all.You won&rsquo;t be disappointed, but definitely go with a better Wilson antenna. They have several to choose from.</p>
