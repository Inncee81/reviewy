<h5 id="they-just-don-t-fit-and-are-poorly-made">They just don&rsquo;t fit, and are poorly made.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Wasabi Batteries, work, yes. But if you want to avoid damaging the door for the battery, I would stay away. The batteries are not square, and increase from a low of 1.4260&rdquo; all the way to 1.4545&rdquo; at the high end. The batteries that come standard with the Gopro Hero4 are 1.4250 at the MAX (ribbon laying down) and it is consistent. I have to say that I am no doubt disappointed with the fit inside the battery compartment (trying to squeeze the door closed). Also the width on the original GoPro batteries is 1.2830&rdquo; at the max, whereas the Wasabi Batteries are 1.2900&rdquo; which also causes some concern for the frugal user who does not want to void his/her warranty. Despite this, they did get the depth correct at .4260&rdquo;. Also, the two batteries that came with this kit were WIDELY different from EACHOTHER. The power is there, but not the quality or the accuracy to keep me easy minded about using them. I will probably return them after further testing.(Gopro battery is the odd one out in all pictures, it has the rounded bottom to it)It is unfortunate, because I had high hopes.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-and-more-affordable-than-original-gopro-stuff">Great product and more affordable than original GoPro stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this product to use with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. In my opinion, the Wasabi brand is just as good as the original GoPro stuff. The batteries charge just as fast and last just as long as the original GoPro battery that came with my action camera. I like how the Wasabi charger allows you to charge two batteries at the same time, which is pretty convenient when you are pressed for time once in a while like I am. The charger here will also charge the original GoPro battery as well, which is a huge plus. Overall, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase here. If you are looking for chargers and batteries that are more affordable than the original GoPro ones but work just as good, then look no further. Buy these and you will love them!</p>

<h5 id="necessary-accessory">Necessary Accessory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to last a bit longer than the OEM battery. I use my GoPro H3 and H4&rsquo;s to record dirt and gravel road bike rides along the East Coast. My intention is to incorporate them into a custom &lsquo;Sufferfest&rsquo; type videos for next winter. The new GoPro H4 has a smaller battery profile so it&rsquo;s battery life is even worse than the H3. With WiFi on, paired with the remote, the OEM runs for just over an hour. The Wasabi gives me an extra five or ten minutes. May not seem like much, but if over time it&rsquo;s significant. Two of these cost less much less than one OEM if you factor in the price of the GoPro charger. I purchased mine with the USB charger. I can plug it into my iPhone charger, the batteries are fresh and ready to go for my next shoot. Hopefully, soon, they will come out with an extended battery that works as well as their H3 model.</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-charger-for-your-hero-4">Great quality charger for your Hero 4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these for my Gopro 3+ and I now have purchased the same brand(these batteries) for my hero 4 black. They work like a charm. I also like the fact that the price point is much better than the &ldquo;premium&rdquo; they charge for GOPRO batteries. I have never had issues with Wasabi power products and would recommend them to anyone looking to save money. It is also nice that they offer the USB connectivity for charging as I have quite a few USB wall outlets and 2-piece chargers.In addition, this charger seems to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; the batteries better than the version for the Hero 3. The dual charger is also very convenient as I can be sure to always have a fully charged set of batteries and use it to store batteries when not in use.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-battery-charger-and-batteries">Excellent battery charger and batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this pack for my go pro hero 4. These batteries perform better than the original go pro battery that came with the camera. Convenient to charge two batteries at once, and nice to always have a back up. Been using these batteries for a year+ and they still seem to have the same performance. Charges the batteries pretty quickly and conveniently lights up green/ red to let you know when the batteries have full charge. I&rsquo;d buy from this company again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-batteries-for-my-gopro">Awesome Batteries for my GoPro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so excited to finally have some great batteries for my GoPro! These were the only Wasabi batteries I could find that sold/and would ship to me. They fit my Hero 4 and (conveniently though not intended) work with my husband&rsquo;s Hero 3.The charging station comes with a USB cord that I plug into my computer for charging. There are indicator lights that are red when you first put the batteries in to charge and turn green to let you know when they&rsquo;re done charging. It&rsquo;s easy, convenient, and works the way it&rsquo;s supposed to.I no longer have to worry about how far away I am from a power source when I use my GoPro!</p>

<h5 id="standard-cheap-china-crap">Standard Cheap China crap.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the batteries and charger almost a year ago. I have had no major problems. They both fit and get arpox. same amount of charge and run time and is close to the GoPro&rsquo;s. My two complaints is one the tab broke in half on me while getting the battery out on a light pull. I managed to use some Scotts tape to fix the problem.The other is a bit more seriouse, I been noticing that the connection was loose but still charged and didn&rsquo;t matter what cable I used, it was still lose. Till about a week ago. I went to plug in the cord to set up a charge at a buddies house. As I pushed it in the connection port broke from the board inside. Now it won&rsquo;t charge and I can hear it rattling around inside. I have to charge them through the camera now as it is the only way I have to charge it.I would put it at <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> stars. Two cause they fit and do work seemly well in the camera but take away the rest for the port breaking off as that is the whole funcion of this thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-batteries-and-charger">Excellent Batteries and Charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bought tons of Wasabi batteries and they are always excellent. These batteries are spares for my Gopro 4 Silver and work fantastic. I especially like the dual charging ports which charge the stock battery as well. Because the charger receives it&rsquo;s power via a USB cord I can use a computer or adapter to wall charge or car charge the batteries which is really nice. The batteries themselves give as good or slightly better record time as the stock battery. For the price you won&rsquo;t find a better deal</p>
