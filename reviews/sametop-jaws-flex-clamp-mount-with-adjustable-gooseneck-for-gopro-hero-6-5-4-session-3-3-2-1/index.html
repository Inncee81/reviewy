<h5 id="comparison-review-of-the-sametop-jaws-flex-clamp-mount">Comparison Review of the SAMETOP - Jaws Flex Clamp mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before I start a lengthy review, I&rsquo;d like to state that I own both the GoPro Flex Clamp and now the Sametop Jaws Flex Clamp. Simply because I have more than one camera, for multi angle shots! So this is a review of the Sametop as compared to GoPro versions. &ldquo;Apples to Apples&rdquo; as we say in the South.Sametop once again offers a quality made product, at a very affordable price. This time they even improved it. As you can plainly see, both models are designed for quickly setting up your camera for a steady shooting position, in almost any location the clamp will fit on.. This device holds it&rsquo;s place by a very strong spring, that allows the user to squeeze the clamp open. Releasing it allows the clamp to close and hold its place. I was unable to measure the clamping pressure, but it is VERY strong. Which offers a great hold. (PRO -The spring tension felt a good bit stronger than the standard GoPro model). The Jaws open wide enough to easily fit a 2&rdquo; thick (2&rdquo; x 4&rdquo;) board.There is a quick connect base mount molded into the top of the clamp. From this base you can mount your Flexible arm, or just the camera. On both the GoPro And Sametop, there is a pair of gripping lips &amp; gums on the ends &amp; inside of the clamp. This helps the clamps to grip onto &ldquo;what ever you clamped it to&rdquo; and not slip or slide. The GoPro comes has a durable rubber inserts, where the Sametop has a durable nylon plastic inserts. Both models held on well when used on slick surfaces, like metal rails or flat fiberglass, etc.The Flexible arms are very similar. Both allow for positioning your action cameras into 360 degrees of camera angles. Both are made of the same materials (probably from the same manufacture?) Both have the male &amp; female quick connect base mounts for your GoPro quick connect, mounting feet. Length: GoPro measured 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; versus the Sametop at 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches. (PRO) - I found that the extra length allowed for easier twisting and bending or the arm to get into the proper camera angles. But both did the job! If you have more than one arm, as in my case, you can even connect the two arms (Gopro &amp; Sametop) together for additional length = 14 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches.When considering the strength of the flexible arm, as to hold up weight. Maybe you want to use it for holding a camera rigged with small lights, or just a light, or external microphone???I did some field tests. I clamped both units to a metal legged, garage shelf, with the flexible arms extending out sideways (at 90 degrees from the shelf). I then hung lead shot, scuba diving weights to measure how much the arm would hold up. The shorter model, GoPro held up 3 pounds. The longer model, Sametop held up 2 pounds. When both arms were combined, they only held up 1 pound of weight. So, the shorter the better, at that angle! I think if you used it with light weight units - a small LED Light, or External Shotgun Microphone, you would be okay.Results of the Sametop - Pro&rsquo;s: High quality material, More affordable price (HELLO), Easily adds to with other attachments &amp; arms, Strong tension spring, Longer 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; arm, 360 degree rotation &amp; swivel, Medium strength of lift, almost unlimited possibilities to securely mount your camera. Con&rsquo;s - Nylon insert in the mouth of the Jaw clamp vs. rubber insert.All in all, the SAMETOP Jaws Flexible clamp is a well made, universal product. I have used it numerous times for quick set ups, and take downs, without having to use a bulky tripod, adhesive style mounts or bolt-on mounts. Connect it to just about anything solid. I&rsquo;m glad I bought it, and highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="easily-supports-a-gopro-and-pan-head">Easily Supports a GoPro and Pan Head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this Jaw Clamp Mount for a commercial video shoot at the SEMA show in Las Vegas. The buy was last minute and we had to count on the items to work. The Jaws Clamp Mount worked flawlessly as a stationary mount for a GoPro attached to a Motorized Time-Lapse Pan Head with power cables to the camera and pan head. The jaws held the weight and was motionless for three full days of time-lapse shooting. Definitely a Sametop customer now.</p>

<h5 id="sametop-jaws-flex-clamp-mount">Sametop Jaws Flex Clamp Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SameTop Clamp: 4 stars (-1 star / buckle connection to clamp loose causing wiggle). Overall build quality is pretty good. The clamp is strong and has a rubber strap to tighten on smaller round objects. The buckle does not fit snugly into the clamp causing the are to move / wiggle. This is a problem if you are clamping this to a bike, scooter, motorcycle, etc. I fixed the connection by putting a small piece of 100 mile an hour (duct) tape on the under side of the buckle - connection is now solid and no wiggle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The grips tips could be made out of a more flexible material so it can grab or put it anywhere. I tried it on my forged highway bars in my motorcycle they just cant get a good grip. Other places were good. Still i recommend this over the gopro brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strong-adjustable-clamp">Strong, adjustable clamp</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with this clamp. Strong clamp, adjustable arm, rubber protection in clamp so it doesn&rsquo;t scratch what you&rsquo;re clamping to.I used this on a Sea Doo, clamping to the grip and did lots of hard moves and the clamp itself never moved. The adjustable arm did move a little bit but I was hitting the waves pretty hard and going under water so it didn&rsquo;t move as much as I thought it would with all that abuse.I&rsquo;d buy this again and do recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="0-its-perfect-also-the-clamp-attachment-is-hard-to-connect">0) its perfect. Also the clamp attachment is hard to connect &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be brief and honest. The product is okay. Not ideal if you wanted to keep your camera up and down. If you want to keep it bent at almost a 90 degree angle (Just realized that my keyboard doesn&rsquo;t have the degree symbol:0) its perfect. Also the clamp attachment is hard to connect to the Flex Clamp, but stays once you get it on. It was even hard to take it apart to take the picture. It serves its purpose.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-had-it-attached-to-the-outside-of-my">So far so good. Had it attached to the outside of my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got this a few days ago and used it with my FDR 3000 action cam. So far so good. Had it attached to the outside of my pickup without any worries because the clamping pressure is really good and the quality of the unit appears to be good too. I would give it five stars, but I want to use it a lot more to see if it will hold up to my use and abuse I am not expecting miracles, but I expect it to be durable over the long haul. If it lasts it will definitely be a bargain compared to the go pro unit. I&rsquo;ll try to report back in a few months.</p>

<h5 id="plastic-s-pretty-cheap-and-brittle">Plastic&rsquo;s pretty cheap and brittle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Plastic&rsquo;s pretty cheap and brittle. Also the clamps jaws&rsquo; got no texture and the rubber padding isn&rsquo;t all that soft. So even though it applies a lot of force, it&rsquo;s still slippery.</p>
