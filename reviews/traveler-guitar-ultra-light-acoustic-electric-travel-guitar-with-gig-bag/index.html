<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="satisfied-with-this-travel-friendly-guitar">Satisfied with this travel-friendly guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am satisfied with this travel friendly guitar. After having tried Yamaha Guitalele and FG Jr. Guitars while traveling, business and personal, I was surprised to find this product which provides a full-size neck and decent tone through your mobile device. I connect my Traveler through an IPod, or IPhone, with Amplitube and sometimes GarageBand. Amplitube provides a range of virtual amps for more choices to shape your sound, I usually use my Traveler for either practice (Yousician) and songwriting. I&rsquo;ve not yet tried recording with it, anyway highly recommend this instrument for guitarists requiring a highly portable full size acoustic-electric, this fits easily within most luggage too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-be-a-better-value-at-150-it-s-basically-just-an-electric-guitar-neck-turned-backwards">Would be a better value at $150&ndash;it&rsquo;s basically just an electric guitar neck turned backwards</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This guitar is not a typical &ldquo;travel&rdquo; guitar that lets you play alone or with others in a semi-quiet area. This guitar (unplugged) is only useful as a solo practice device; it is very quiet&mdash;similar to playing a solid body electric guitar with no amp. The neck quality is OK but not great&mdash;I had to file down the sharp fret ends. I also did some adjustment to the nut to get better action, but other players may have been OK with it as delivered.The internal pickup works OK, but is not convenient for my situation. I may have to get a small battery powered ear-bud amp to allow practice in anything other than a quiet room. I was disappointed with my first outdoor test (on a sailboat). I really couldn&rsquo;t hear it as well as I had hoped.Although a regular guitar strap will work on this guitar, one end of the strap interferes with my right elbow. The strap button (and pickup jack) is on the very top rear of the guitar, so about 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches of leather strap sticks above the guitar and digs into my elbow. I cut the leather down as far as I could, but it&rsquo;s still not flush with the guitar. A strap having a very narrow &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; about 6 inches long would work much better. Considering the cost of this guitar, a simple suitable strap should be provided.The gig bag is adequate, and held a truss rod adjustment tool along with very simple instructions. A side pocket to just enough to hold the lap rest along with a tuner, some picks, and a set of spare strings.So overall I am satisfied, but considering the relatively high price I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very good value.</p>

<h5 id="great-guitar-after-changing-strings">Great guitar after changing strings</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A high quality instrument but the strings that came with it were very noisy. I replaced the strings and the guitar now works great, so one star minus for the poor strings. Even so the body is very small it does play like a full size guitar, I am very happy with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-finally-wake-up">I finally wake up!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the past decade my overseas deployments inevitably find me buying a guitar locally and then donating it to some worthy cause when I leave. Now I can take my box with me! Innovative design and great action this ultra light is a great companion to my other guitars and as a lefty I no longer have to suffer the &lsquo; we&rsquo;ll change the strings round for you&rsquo; response in foreign countries. An added bonus was that having looked at the guitar over a 6 month period I found that when I came to buy it the price had dropped by nearly 30%. Only down side is it really needs a small amp but with the market abundant I had no trouble picking one up that fitted inside my suitcase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-travel-companion-with-a-tweak">Perfect Travel Companion, (with a tweak)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all I love this as a travel guitar. And I&rsquo;m considering adding other models to my collection, even though I don&rsquo;t really need them. It took me a while to decide if I wanted the Original Escape, the Pro, or the Ultra Light-Acoustic or Electric. In the end I bought the Ultra-light Acoustic.I wanted something super small so I wouldn&rsquo;t have some excuse not to take it with me on long overseas trips. I really liked the Pro, but I wasn&rsquo;t thrilled about the little wooden leg support. And unlike my ultra-light which I have the option of not using, the pro-needs the wooden leg attached to work, and it seems like it would take more time to set up. The metal leg brace on the ultra pops in a second (it looks weird but it works nicely!)And there are a few reports of the pro and the wood brace cracking as well. So I decided to stay away from it.The ultra Light has a nice ebony fretboard, the tuning is a little odd, but you quickly get used to it. Changing strings takes a little getting used to but isn&rsquo;t really a problem. The Guitar seems to stay in tune very well and the neck was nice and straight with no Truss adjustments needed..There is no volume adjustment, so you need to adjust the volume from your amp. Sounds from the Pizo pickup is good, and when I went into my VOX AC-30 with a little overdrive sounded just like an electric guitar&hellip;My major issue was the the string action, admittedly I like really low string action on acoustics and ones that tend to play like electrics(I like taylor acoustics for this reason). But the action as shipped was usable at the low frets, but at the higher frets above about 12 made flat picking a chore.However I simply adjusted the saddle (basically a guitar setup procedure where you file/sand down the saddle until you get to the string height). If you know how to do this aready it is pretty easy on this guitar as the saddle is removable, if not then any guitar shop/Luthor will do it for you.Once I adjusted this, I love the feel. I have acoustic strings on it and it feels a lot like my Les Paul or my Taylors. (Note it has a 24 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; scale which is on the low side of what is considered a standard. Les Pauls are ~24 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, Strats are 25 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;. But it is certainly normal, not short like some of the other funky travel guitars out there.To compare, I did first buy a Washburn Rover which had glowing reviews, however I thought it was a piece of junk. Very toy like and had terrible neck feel and string action. Returned it right away. However this is a very playable guitar even for an experiance guitarist like my self. Good for travel and just practicing on the couch.However be aware that with acoustic strings you aren&rsquo;t going to get much sound out of it without an amp (compared to a normal acoustic). I don&rsquo;t really care since I often play or practice my electrics not plugged in. So this probably isn&rsquo;t for you if you want to sit around the campfire and entertain. However I would recommend for an easy guitar to take with you anywhere.In it&rsquo;s case it is really small and easily carried over shoulder and can be wedged into a tight space in a bag bin on an airplane. Looks kind of like a short shotgun when in it&rsquo;s case..</p>

<h5 id="love-this-guitar-for-travelling">Love this guitar for travelling!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I usually play a full size acoustic guitar so it takes a little getting used to. It is perfect for travelling as It fits in the overhead bin of most aircrafts. I practice with it in my hotel room, usually without any connection to headphones or speaker, I can hear it just fine and I don&rsquo;t disturb any of my neighbors with it. I now don&rsquo;t miss any practice time when I travel it&rsquo;s great and I have recommended it to several of my fellow musicians.</p>

<p>I really love playing this guitar. Every since I received it, it has been by my side. Full sized neck. Sustain is fantastic. It stays in tune even with new strings.</p>
