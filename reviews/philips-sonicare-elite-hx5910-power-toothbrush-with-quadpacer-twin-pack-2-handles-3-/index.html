<h5 id="dental-cleaning-on-par-with-the-dentist">Dental cleaning on par with the dentist</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a Sonicare Elite E-series toothbrush a few months ago. Thereunto I had been treated by 3 separate dentists who said that, &ldquo;I did a great job for someone who uses a manual toothbrush.&rdquo; Still, scraping at each dental checkup was in order.I brush with the Sonicare morning and evening, using a manual brush at the office after lunch. My last dental checkup was astounding. About 90 seconds of very light scraping and that was it. My dentist said that the thoroughness of my brushing was evident. Also, the dentist said that Sonicare brushing is much gentler to the gums so I don&rsquo;t tear them up in the way that manual brushing does.The dentist affirmed some of my approach and added to it. The summary is:1. Floss first.2. Before turning the brush on, use the brush head to spread the toothpaste as best as possible over all the exposed teeth to maximize flouride dwell time.3. Brush the lower teeth first since these teeth hold most of the gunk as saliva drips down and dwells on the bottom teeth most of the day.4. Brush &ldquo;twice&rdquo; during the two minute period. 30 seconds the cover the bottom teeth, 30 seconds on the upper and brushing the tongue, too. Then repeat on each set of teeth. This ensures you have covered each set in the first minute further enhancing dwell time, and you have the ability to cover any missed spots on the second pass.5. Expectorate (spit out) and rinse.This series is considered an &ldquo;older&rdquo; model, and it requires extra maintenance, checking regularly inside the top of the toothbrush handle and cleaning it out. This was a design shortcoming that allows dripdown from the brush into that part of the handle base. Just keep it clean and ensure it dries out well lest it start to smell from build-up.Since engaging the use of a Sonicare electric toothbrush I enjoy that &ldquo;freshly cleaned by the dental hygienist&rdquo; feeling on my teeth daily. My dental checkup was astounding. Yours can be, too. Purchase one of these Sonicare electric toothbrushes. It will change your dental life all for the better. I highly recommend this gadget.</p>

<h5 id="great-deal">Great Deal !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are looking for two Sonicare toothbrushes, this is a good deal. I have used all the fancier versions of the Sonicares and I can tell you that they all do about the same thing. The higher priced versions just have options that you probably won&rsquo;t need or use anyway. This one does have the two minute auto shut off with a gentle reminder every 30 seconds. It has a gum massage mode too. Plus these are the rechargable kind with the base that you just set the toothbrush on. No plugs or anything. Just a good deal on two Sonicares.</p>

<h5 id="quality-issues">Quality Issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have ordered this product twice. I ordered one twin pack for my husband and myself and later another for our kids. With both purchases one of the toothbrushes came in dead! When I went to charge the toothbrushes one had no flashing light on the front indicating that it was charging. I put it on the charger anyway and the next day it still did not work. I called Phillips and they agreed to send me a new one within 1 to 2 weeks. That was frustrating, but it did come in much quicker than that and the new one did work.We are really pleased with the toothbrushes. They clean very well and I like having the little beep every thirty seconds to prompt you to move to a new area in the mouth. I have my mouth set up in quadrants now and spend the 30 seconds in each one. Then the toothbrush shuts off after two minutes. I turn it back on and press the on button twice for the gum massage mode and massage all of my gums. I wish I&rsquo;d had this toothbrush years ago - from childhood, in fact. So, we decided to spend the money and get our two kids their own sonicare toothbrushes. They are 9 and 10 and the kids model of sonicare brush is only recommended to age 10, so I decided to purchase this same model for them. Same thing- only one of them works! I had to call Phillips again and have another one sent out.When they send you a new one, they give you a label and ask that you return the defective one to them via a Fed-X drop-box or retailer. I had that box riding around in my car for over a week before I had time. I asked this time if I could keep the brush head that came it because he said to mail the handle back and he said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; I could keep the brush. So at least I get an extra replacement head.Bottom Line: The actual toothbrush I would give 5 stars. Phillips quality control I would give 1 star.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-get-me-wrong-this-toothbrush-works-well">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this toothbrush works well. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this toothbrush works well. It&rsquo;s just the fact that no one ever mentions that the inside of the brush head gets some really nasty buildup! If you don&rsquo;t properly clean your brush heads after every use or so, there will be some nasty buildup!!! My husband and I use to have an Oral-B electronic toothbrush before and we never had this problem. We will be looking into another Sonic Care one but just not the E-series one. Also, the replacement heads are expensive! If you do happen to choose this particular model, make sure you clean it often.</p>

<h5 id="happy-teeth">Happy Teeth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband was convinced he wanted these. Pretty good price for 2 full brushes. I have used the cheapo battery spin brushes in the past and this blows them away. It pretty much pulverizes the toothpaste and don&rsquo;t even think about rinsing it while it&rsquo;s on because your going to end up with water splashing everywhere. It has a 2 minute shut off so you know you have brushed properly. My favorite thing is the charging base. NO more buying batteries or brushing with a half dead spin brush! And the base is solid so easy to clean.I guess I owe the hubby a thank you for ordering these. He&rsquo;s right sometimes :)</p>

<h5 id="love-this-thing">Love this thing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Need to get another, battery is wearing out, been about 4 years though. Heads are pretty dang expensive, but I like this thing for sure.</p>
