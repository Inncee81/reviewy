<h5 id="this-bag-is-great-after-realizing-i-just-couldn-t-afford-the-three">This bag is GREAT! After realizing I just couldn&rsquo;t afford the three &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This bag is GREAT! After realizing I just couldn&rsquo;t afford the three hundred dollar designer laptop bag I&rsquo;ve been eyeing, I decided to give amazon a shot to see what was available.I&rsquo;m a young, cool (I think, anyway), professional woman, &amp; those clunky black vinyl laptop bags just aren&rsquo;t for me. Sorry! When I found this I thought it was too good to be true, BUT ITS NOT!!!Pros:- fantastic quality. The zippers are nice &amp; heavy, the hooks on the strap are metal not plastic.- beautiful print. I&rsquo;m a fan of florals &amp; found myself having to &ldquo;eeny meeny miney moe&rdquo; just to pick a design. I settled on the navy floral &amp; am pleased. The fabric is heavy &amp; seems very durable.- pockets! There are two pockets, one has a slot for phone/pen/small notepad/makeup/whatever. The second pocket is great for a charger or mouse.- size. I was worried this was going to be too small, but at the right size for me. For reference- my work laptop is an heavy 15 inch clunker &amp; it fits in there just fine. I can even add a folio notebook &amp; while it&rsquo;s a bit jammed, it fits! If you have a super cool thin laptop, you&rsquo;ll be fine!- compliments! Everyone who sees the bag loves it &amp; can&rsquo;t believe the price I got it for.Cons:- I wish the strap was black or navy instead of white, or they gave options on colors. But that&rsquo;s just whatever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my wife&rsquo;s Dell Inspiron 3000 (15.6&rdquo; screen). She loves it and is very happy I didn&rsquo;t go with a boring gray/black laptop bag. It easy fits the laptop, power cable/adapter and a small mouse. Recommended.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-functional-and-high-quality">Beautiful, Functional, AND High Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to catch this while it&rsquo;s in stock, grab it! I debated between this and the one without a handle or a strap. I have pretty awful rheumatoid arthritis and was worried it might slip out of my hands if I try to pull it out of my bag or off the table without handles. I decided I liked the versatility of this one, and the added security of the strap to grab onto verses grabbing the side of the entire sleeve. Definitely made the right choice!What I got: 13 Inch White Rose Pattern with handles and straps; it is a deep navy blue with blush and white roses and leaves, with an overall dusty/vintage look to it. The inside is the normal soft lining you typically see inside purses, though it feels a bit thicker and more sturdy in my opinion. I think it looks exactly like the pictures, at least for the model I ordered. (Take into consideration your screen resolution and brightness, and the angle of your laptop if you&rsquo;re not mobile, because you&rsquo;d be amazed how much that can change things.)It&rsquo;s thick and feels very sturdy. It also has not one, not two, but THREE large pockets! That alone is a winner for me. There&rsquo;s the one with the zipper that you see in the image where you can easily store a slim mouse and some pens/pencils, probably your phone as well. Then under that pocket by the handle is an opening, and there&rsquo;s a pocket that extends the entire width of the case. You could easily fit a phone, a tablet, a smaller notebook, writing materials, a calculator, and a slim battery (probably not a large one, though). It does this on both sides, too!I personally am not using the strap because it goes into a large tote bag for school, so I can&rsquo;t comment on the quality of that (I&rsquo;ve seen reviews that it breaks after a few months). I can however say that if you&rsquo;re concerned it won&rsquo;t fit your laptop, here&rsquo;s my comparison: I&rsquo;m using an HP Stream 13. There is enough room in the main compartment for my laptop, a folder, and a 1-subject notebook with a pen attached to the spiral. Then there&rsquo;s still plenty of space in all three pockets for other necessities. I also have a larger Toshiba with a large battery, not at ALL a slim design, and it fits without folders/notebooks. It&rsquo;s a tight fit, for sure, but it can work! I stalked this product until it was in stock because I love the design and color pallet so much, and I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t settle for something boring. Thank goodness you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice looks for quality on this one.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-and-functional">Beautiful and Functional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received it and love it already. I bought it for a MacBook Air with a Mosiso Plastic Hard Case. This fits easily, with room for my iPad and both sides are great and roomy for cords and iPhones, etc. I chose the 15&rdquo; MacBook size so I can enjoy the extra room instead of the tight fit normally suggested for my smaller MacBook Air. Plus, it is beautiful. I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if the shoulder strap had the same pattern as the bag and handle, but it is firmly made and the entire bag is really nice.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful">Beautiful!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE IT! Very great quality and super cute! I have a MacBook Air 11 inch and I still can put a few more things in it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-but-flimsy">Cute but flimsy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very thin. I highly doubt my laptop would survive in this of it were to fall but you get what you pay for. It&rsquo;s cute but my shoulder strap had a small snag. It also doesn&rsquo;t fit the laptop snug and it&rsquo;s very thin so you won&rsquo;t be able to fit a whole lot in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="oversized">Oversized!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bag is Pretty and it&rsquo;s a nice quality but the product description is WRONG! I have a 13&rdquo; MacBook Pro with touch bar.The bag is huge. This would be a good fit for a 15&rdquo;-17&rdquo; computer not a 13&rdquo; The color is more of a bright blue than the navy blue which is shown in the product description. In the picture I took my laptop has a hardshell case on it as well and the bag is still oversized.</p>

<h5 id="in-the-past-i-d-just-thrown-it-in-a-bag-and-hoped-for-the-best-but-when-i-bought-a-new-macbook-i">In the past I&rsquo;d just thrown it in a bag and hoped for the best, but when I bought a new MacBook I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cute and keeps my laptop safe. I&rsquo;m not some business executive that takes my laptop everywhere, I rarely travel with my computer but I do need to occasionally. In the past I&rsquo;d just thrown it in a bag and hoped for the best, but when I bought a new MacBook I decided it was time to be smart. I bought a cute case so I felt cute when I carried it. It&rsquo;s not childish looking but isn&rsquo;t fancy leather either. Just a cute case that works.</p>

<h5 id="cute-but-not-for-every-day">Cute but not for every day</h5>

<p>The bag is navy blue and the pink is much more brighter but still such a cute looking bag! Holds everything pretty well inside (Dell work laptop, spiral notebook, iPad).</p>
