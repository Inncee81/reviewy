<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Take flight at night
Go on around-the-clock adventures with your second-generation Parrot Airborne Night MiniDrone. This futuristic MiniDrone features two powerful headlights with adjustable intensity. Choose from Flash, Blink and Light Wave modes to set the mood. Add the sturdy, removable shield to take on more challenging environments.</p>

<p>Twist and turn with one tap
Amplify your acrobatics with 360° forward and backward flips. Tilt from 90° to 180° with a single tap.</p>

<p>Start your engines in seconds
With the FreeFall Takeoff feature, you can release your MiniDrone into the air and the propellers immediately come to life. If your MiniDrone collides with an object, the propeller circuit breaker engages to reduce potential damage.</p>

<p>Fly fast and stay smooth
Airborne Night is an ultra-light MiniDrone designed for stability and speed. At 1.9 oz (54 grams), you can fly fast and strong— even at night. Stay streamlined and avoid turbulence thanks to the power of the 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer.</p>

<p>Take control of your flight
Piloting your MiniDrone is simple with FreeFlight 3. Download the free app to your smartphone or tablet and get instant access to in-flight tricks and maneuvers. Take aerial photos during your flight and view them later with friends and family. *FreeFlight 3 is available in the App Store or in the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Tips for getting started
Before takeoff, be sure to update your Airborne Night&rsquo;s software and fully charge its battery. For double the flight time and twice the fun, pick up an extra battery with your purchase. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our support team at 877-9Parrot (877-972-7768) or at www.parrot.com/support</p>

<h5 id="watched-130-fly-away-uncontrolled-climb-issue-common">Watched $130 fly away - uncontrolled climb issue common&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really excited about this product and had one great indoor flight, then recharged. Two days later - a software update occurred, but I thought nothing of it and went outside. After hitting the &ldquo;take off&rdquo; button, I saw the drone climb and stopped responding to my control inputs. I hit the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; button to make the drone land, but there was no response&hellip; It kept climbing until it was out of sight. Apparently this uncontrolled ascent is a common issue looking at other reviews and Parrot&rsquo;s online support forums.I have contacted Parrot&rsquo;s customer service line and will adjust my rating if they respond well, other wise - know that I spent $130 on a drone for 10 minutes of flight time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-indoor-drone-on-the-market-today">The best INDOOR drone on the market today!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This should be marketed as an indoor drone; if Parrot had done that, this quadcopter would have had 5 star reviews.I own a dozen different drones - from a Cheerson mini to a Phantom 4, Chroma 4k, Typhoon 500+, and Typhoon H.This is the ONLY mini drone that I know of that has a sonic sensor to maintain altitude and position. Sure the Typhoon H, Phantom 4 and 3 Pro have altitude sensors for indoor use, but they are OUTDOOR drones&hellip;where they work best with a GPS signal.This Parrot holds a rather (surprisingly) steady attitude indoors! If I hover in one spot, it stays within a foot (generally) of the area without any input.This would be a great drone to practice your &lsquo;Nose In&rsquo; moves.I bought mine for just over $50, and at that price, there is NOTHING on the market that has the INDOOR stability of this drone. This thing is an absolute steal at $50!If you are looking for an indoor drone that is stable and quick, this is it! Nothing else comes close.I do NOT recommend flying a bluetooth drone outdoors because of the signal problems. But indoors, this quad is magic!</p>

<h5 id="small-drone-big-features">Small Drone Big Features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This drone is amazingly stable in flight and very fun to fly for its size it is one of the most advanced drones on the market. I really like the headlight function and the decals on this drone since it usually grabs attention and adds to the experience and since you can fly this drone with your Android or Apple mobile device, tablet, and etc through Parrots app anyone can fly this drone and perform maneuvers like a pro. There are three small things however that I dont like about this drone though 1.Drone works off of Bluetooth and not WiFi 2.Flying the drone on the controller or ace modes can be difficult due to the virtual joysticks on your device 3.Drone comes with one battery instead of two so every 5-8 mins you are looking for a receptacle to charge the drone for about 25 mins. All things considered this is the drone to have if you want a high tech, easy to fly, nicely crafted drone. Also as a side note I had to contact Parrot customer service and they responded quickly to my email and even sent me a part for this drone at no cost even though I bought it as an open box item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sure-would-be-nice-if-the-on-off-switch-worked-and-or-if-parrots-customer-support-was-competent">Sure would be nice if the on/off switch worked&hellip; and/or if Parrots customer support was competent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fun little drone. I would consider giving it 4 stars, but the on/off switch never worked from the moment I opened the box. I&rsquo;ve been flying the drone, but the only way to turn it off without the on/off switch is to remove the battery. I contacted Parrot customer support, but was very disappointed. They took 2 days to respond to my initial request, but the response was neither thoughtful nor helpful. Specifically, they wanted to know how I was pushing the on/off switch and asked me to send them a video. How many ways can there be to use an on/off switch? (this is a rhetorical question) I&rsquo;ve been using on/off switches for over 4 decades&hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know how to use one, and this one doesn&rsquo;t work. I replied to Parrot customer support several days ago, but they haven&rsquo;t bothered to reply.I can still use the drone (again, I can turn it off by removing the battery), but I&rsquo;m disappointed about buying a new drone that doesn&rsquo;t work like a new drone. And Parrot customer service has been worthless.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-a-couple-of-drones-but-this-one-gets">I have a couple of drones but this one gets &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a couple of drones but this one gets as much flight time as the bigger ones do because it handles so well indoors. Not really powerful enough to fly in any amount of wind outdoors</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-the-parrot-mambo-and-is-awesome-responds-very-well-to-controlled-and-app">I have the parrot mambo and is awesome responds very well to controlled and app</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortenutly has not been flying very well. Doesn&rsquo;t stay connected to my parrot controller. Doesn&rsquo;t respond to the commands from app or parrot controller. Really wanted this kind cause its able to be flown at night. 👎. I have the parrot mambo and is awesome responds very well to controlled and app.</p>

<h5 id="good">good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was searching for, good value</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-the-second-time-i-we-purchased-this-item">This was the second time I we purchased this item &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the second time I we purchased this item. The first one was taken out on Christmas day and we flew it until the transmitter lost contact with the drone and went straight up and out of sight. We never found it so, thinking it was pilot error, we bought another one, learned to fly it, and now one of the propellers will not stop spinning rapidly, and when we attempt to fly the drone, the other propellers do not start at the same speed and the drone wants to move sideways in the direction of the faster propeller causing it to crash. There are too many other people who have had problems with this item to be the fault of the purchaser. I want my money back!</p>
