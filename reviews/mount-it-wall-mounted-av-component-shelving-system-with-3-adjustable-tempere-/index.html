<h5 id="i-dig-this">I dig this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this mount! Yes, they can be a bit flimsy from the sides but regardless of that, they are still strong enough to hold a good amount of weight. They hold my heavy Xbox One and even a long heavy vizio soundbar without any issues. The compartment in the back of the mount comes in major handy as well and holds all my wires neatly as you can see in my picture. It&rsquo;s holding the wires from my Xbox, cable box, tv, Firestick wires, hdmi wires and my soundbar wire (yes all those wires were able to fit in the wire holding compartment inside this mount). I&rsquo;m very satisfied with this product and would definitely buy it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-unit">Love this unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this unit. I looked all over for a wall mounted adjustable shelving unit with glass shelves.Could never find what I needed and the prices were gougingly high.The price for this unit is incredibly reasonable Easy to install. Shelves can be moved as needed.I was able to install it myself. I put it right under my wall mounted TV. This unit leavesplenty of space to put a cabinet or any other item under the shelving. I cannow put an end table at the end of my couch where it belongs.Other reviews comment on space. The shelf is 12Dx15w. I was able to space the shelves 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-7&rdquo;apart which is plenty of room for the units I have. I zip-tied the wires to the wall mount so theydon&rsquo;t hang loose. The glass shelf is secured with a screw at the back and sits on a V-shaped support.Instructions say best to secure in 2x4. I had to use wall mounts for my location and it is very secure.What a space saver.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-assemble-dvd-audio-shelf">Easy to assemble DVD/audio shelf</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice floating wall mounted shelf. Measuring at 15 x 11 x 22.8 inches height. I like that the shelves are adjustable. I purchased this for my dvd player. This does have a cable management track for behind the shelf that I didn&rsquo;t use as it wasn&rsquo;t necessary for my use.This was easy to put together and assemble. I also love that inside the box was packaged so well. They form fitted the styrofoam around each shelf piece for maximum protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-we-needed">Just what we needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This shelving unit is just what we needed! We moved into a duplex that has a flat screen TV mounted to the wall above a fireplace, but the mantelpiece is too narrow to hold essential electronics (cable boxes, blue ray players, gaming system, etc.) and there is no built-in shelving on either side of the fireplace. This 3-tier unit holds all of our electronics and it compliments the living room decor without being too noticeable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-large-enough">Not large enough!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The construction of it is okay, but beware. We measured all of our devices before buying it. The shelves are 11&rdquo;x15&rdquo;. Our cable box, and xbox one are those same dimensions. We thought they would fit perfectly. However, once you add in the cords on the back, our boxes are hanging off of the shelves and the cords are bent in the back. The main metal part in the back should have been thicker to incorporate the cords, or the shelves should be one or two inches bigger or so. It looks nice, but BIG design flaw with all of the cords for boxes now coming out of the back. It looks a decent bit smaller than it does in the picture as well. Just something to keep in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-shelf-and-love-the-mount-it-version">Great shelf, and love the Mount-It version.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Every Mount-It product I have used has been a pleasure. I bought the VonHaus version of this shelf, VonHaus 2x Black Floating Shelf with Strengthened Tempered Glass for DVD Players/Cable Boxes/Games Consoles/TV Accessories, originally because it was cheaper and I thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same shelf, why not?&rdquo;. Well I can tell you why not, there were no screw holes in the metal upright that you mount to the wall. I would have needed to either drill them myself or somehow displace matter as I mounted the unit. I returned it to amazon without issue and immediately ordered this one, as I have used and enjoyed Mount-It products in the past. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.The installation was a breeze and it looks great.As far as the shelf in general, I think the design is a bit strange. The &ldquo;cable management&rdquo; thing at the side seems like it would only work if you placed the cables in before you affixed it to the wall (I didn&rsquo;t use it but did use them as cable tie anchor points). I am using the shelf for my modem, router and phone box, so not very demanding on weight. I used drywall anchors and didn&rsquo;t place it in a stud, but it holds well and no movement. I would definitely recommend this shelf for light duty tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shelves-to-small-for-electronics">Shelves to small for electronics.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shelves are not deep enough for my amp with cabling in the back. When I unpacked, the shelves seemed small but I tried it anyways. Was disappointed and ended up being an empty wall shelf. Nice looking though, I didn&rsquo;t take it down. But not certain what I&rsquo;ll end up putting on it, decor maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="teeny-tiny-shelves">Teeny Tiny shelves.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t have bought. Too Small</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wobbly-not-really-a-good-buy">Wobbly. Not really a good buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super wobbly. Scared to have my belongings on it. It&rsquo;s on a stud, as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great and looks good!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stylish-and-functional">Stylish and functional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Is a very nice and stylish shelf. It is not too hard to install. It has held up our Comcast box so far without falling off the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice for extra storage. Easy setup. If you need photos or videos of my set up, just comment and I&rsquo;ll post one to this thread.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very helpful</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The shelves are way too small for cable boxes. I am not able to use it as desired.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice product and super easy to install! Just read the directions!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my bedroom. Pretty sturdy and holds my DVD player and cable box. Looks very sleek and I&rsquo;m glad that I purchase this one. These shelves are perfect for my needs.</p>
