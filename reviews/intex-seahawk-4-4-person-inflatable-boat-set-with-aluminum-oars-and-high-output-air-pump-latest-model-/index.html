Ideal for recreational boating or fishing on lakes and calm rivers, the Intex SeaHawk 4 boat set comes with everything you need to hit the water immediately. The inflatable boat&ndash;which fits up to four people&ndash;is made of super-tough 30-gauge PVC vinyl that resists damage from abrasion, impacts, and sunlight, letting you boat with confidence even near rocks or logs. The PVC is also unaffected by gasoline, oil, or saltwater, so you needn&rsquo;t take special precautions around a motor or near a saltwater inlet. Construction-wise, the boat includes two air chambers for safety, an inner hull chamber, an inflatable floor that&rsquo;s comfortable yet rigid, welded oarlocks, inflatable cushions, and an all-around grab line. The boat even sports two fishing rod holders at the rear&ndash;one on each side&ndash;so you can enjoy an afternoon angling with friends. Other features include a grab handle on the bow, oar holders, a gear pouch, and a U.S. Coast Guard ID. The SeaHawk 4 - which comes with oars and an inflation pump&ndash;measures 133 by 19.5 by 50 inches (W x H x D) and holds up to 814 pounds.</p>

<h5 id="great-raft-fun-to-customize">Great raft | Fun to customize</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this and thought it would just be another cheap kid&rsquo;s raft. Boy, was a wrong, this is a very much adult boat.A few flaws can be corrected in this boat, if you&rsquo;re up for a project.I&rsquo;ll start with the positive, first.pros:1) Large (seats 4 people)(more like 2-3, lol)2) Easy to maneuver. As you may know, rafts sit on top of the water rather than in it. This boat is easy to paddle with the oars provided.3) thick vinyl. Seriously, this thing won&rsquo;t pop unless you hit a sharp rock, log, or bulkhead.4) storage pouchcons1) soft floor (cant stand up)2) uncomfortable seats (inflatable, no back support)3) I get tired of paddlingNow dont stop reading my review here. I&rsquo;m a go-getter, soo, I fixed all the cons and created my dream (budget) boat.I added a wood floor with 3/4in plywood. I can stand and cast my rod and walk to the other end of the boat. This maximised the interior space too, because i can just set stuff on the floor w/o it rolling towards the point where im sitting.I added pvc pipes under the floor for added stability and padded the edges.I also added a trolling motor with 30lb thrust and let me tell you, it trolls faster than you&rsquo;d believe.I added 2 &ldquo;seats&rdquo; - coolers with stadium seats on them. This gave me storage inside the coolers and a seat to sit on. The backrests maximized my time out on the water because i was just so comfortable.I will upload some photos and I hope I can inspire others!</p>

<h5 id="a-great-boat-for-the-guy-who-doesn-t-want-the-bother-of-a-real-boat">A great boat for the guy who doesn&rsquo;t want the bother of a real boat.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took my boat out for the first time today. It was better than I expected. Very stable, a lot of room. It&rsquo;s a little too big for one man to pick up so I placed it on a cheap blue tarp inflated it and dragged it down to the water. The oars are kind of short so they take some time to get used to. I have one complaint. The air valve for the floor is the size of one used for a pool toy. It takes forever to deflate the floor a bigger valve and I would have had it packed up in 5 minutes. It took me about 3 times that. I&rsquo;ll probably get the motor pkg. in the spring. I also bought a kind of a bean bag chair with a back and arms worked really great for fishing.</p>

<h5 id="great-sturdy-and-fun-boat">Great sturdy and fun boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This boat really is comfortable, easy to set up and put away. It has some weight to it in concern for set up and put away, but we caught many fish on our first trip out had no troubles and enjoyed boating without rental fees or going in debt buying one. We do think it is more of a 3 person boat unless at least two are fairly small or children.</p>

<h5 id="the-boat-was-lots-of-fun-however-this-is-supposed-to-hold-four-people-and">The boat was lots of fun however this is supposed to hold four people and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought boat for our camping trip to float on nearby lake. The boat was lots of fun however this is supposed to hold four people and only holds two comfortably so was perfect for us. The oars were as you would expect for a boat of this price, they worked but were a little short. The seats just plain sucked and got in the way. Would work better for emergency floating device. Better to just sit on bottom of boat. All in all this boat added a great experience to our camping trip and without it we wouldnâ€™t have gotten to see a bald eagle across the lake .</p>

<p>Very good quality.I infalytyed it and left it for two days to stretch.I used it on alke for hours.Very happy with it.Will buy it again.</p>

<h5 id="we-really-wanted-to-love-this-boat">We REALLY wanted to love this boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We REALLY wanted to love this boat, but the one that came had a teeny tiny hole somewhere in it. Only discovered it while we were out on a lake with the kids (having a blast) and noticed it starting to deflate slightly. Fortunately we brought the pump with us so didn&rsquo;t get stranded. We tried all kinds of methods (spray down with soap, etc) to find the hole, to no avail, so ended up returning. Will reorder a new one for next summer because it was an awesome little boat otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-to-say-i-was-pretty-skeptical-about-this-boat">I have to say I was pretty skeptical about this boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to say I was pretty skeptical about this boat. in fact I was so afraid that it would pop if a fishing hook got stuck to it. The whole getting it set up is not bad at all. Pumping the boat was a bit tiring. My boyfriend, son and I fit pretty good in that boat. afterall my boyfriend is over 6 ft tall.It was actually pretty spacious. We even brought a big cooler. Now i did get my fishing hook stuck on the boat but manage to get it out leaving no hole at all. Now after several times of pumping I will recommend to becareful to get sand where you pump. The boat will leak if not sealed well. that was my experience because my boat started to leak and i was wondering what caused it and kept thinking was it my fishing hook but it was not. if you get it sandy always try to rinse it off. Overall its perfect for my family.</p>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>
