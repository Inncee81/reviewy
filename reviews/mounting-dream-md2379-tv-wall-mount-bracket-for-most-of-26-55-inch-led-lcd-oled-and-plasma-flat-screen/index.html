<blockquote>
<p>Have researched these and checked local electronic stores for what&rsquo;s available and quality. Purchased this for 42&rdquo; TV because of the design not knowing about the quality, but what a great product and easy to install. This compares to the units sold at electronic Express for $169.</p>

<h5 id="with-a-few-tweaks-it-s-by-far-the-best-tv-mount-i-ve-ever-owned">With a few tweaks, it&rsquo;s by far the best tv mount I&rsquo;ve ever owned!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easily the best tv mount I&rsquo;ve ever bought! The mounting works like a dream and the tv swings and rotates very easily. I mounted mine onto a cinderblock wall using a flat piece of plywood as the base (using special tapcon screws meant for masonry) and then mounted the tv to the plywood. I was concerned that the tv mount might work it&rsquo;s wiggle out of the wall over time what with all the swiveling it&rsquo;ll be doing and attaching it to the 18 x 18 x <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> plywood helps to distribute any wiggle that might develop across a wider surface area. Now, the tv mount would have to pull out 6 long, heavy-duty lag bolts from the cinderblock wall to ever fall off!Pros:Easy to install and assemble,high quality construction of the mount itself, swivels nicely with no &ldquo;dangle&rdquo; despite the heavy tv attached to it,it would clearly work for a much heavier tv even though mine is like 44&rdquo;.Cons:The bracket that attaches to the tv itself blocks most of the cable jacks on the back of my tv (I fixed this by getting <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>270</sub> degree adapters so the cables connect from the bottom instead of straight on which actually makes for a much easier time when trying to get the cables to hang down all nice and neat),the actual screws and bolts that came with the tv are very cheaply made (I wouldn&rsquo;t trust my $400 investment to some cheap, Chinese-manufactured, pot-metal screws and bolts) so I replaced them for $5 with some quality American made steel bolts and screws <strong>with a mount like this of such high quality at this low of a price, I guess this is where they decided to cut costs and gain back some profit by going with cheaper bolts/screws/washers</strong>.Bonus: My sister (who weighs about 115-120 lbs) did a couple of pull-ups on this mount after it was installed and extended out all the way but it never budged or sagged at all!! Quality made!Conclusion: With a few extra tweaks and parts, this tv mount will suit all your needs for years to come! Not overly technical to install and you can&rsquo;t beat the price for such a high quality flat screen mount. Definitely a buy for anyone wanting to mount their larger flat screen tv!</p>

<h5 id="mounting-dream-md2379-tv-wall-mount-bracket-with-full-motion-dual-articulating-arm-review">Mounting Dream MD2379 TV Wall Mount Bracket with Full Motion Dual Articulating Arm Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We just moved into a new home and were looking for 2 TV mounts; one with a full motion arm one without an arm (see my other review for this tilt-only mount: Fortress Mount TV Wall Mount for 40-70&rdquo; TVs up to 165 lbs with 9-feet Braided HDMI Cable ).Due to the low price point, I was concerned we would receive a lesser-quality of product. Boy was I wrong! This wall mount and I was shocked at the sturdiness of the product - it was exactly like the wall mount we purchased previously that 4 TIMES THE PRICE! There were easy to follow instructions and it we had it drilled and mounted within minutes.Should I buy another TV that needs a full motion arm, I will be purchasing this one! Mounting Dream MD2379 TV Wall Mount Bracket with Full Motion Dual Articulating Arm for most of 26-55 Inches LED, LCD and Plasma TVs up to VESA 400x400mm and 99 lbs with Tilt, Swivel, and Rotation</p>

<h5 id="pulling-the-tv-in-and-out-is-pretty-smooth-though-you-may-have-trouble-getting-it">Pulling the TV in and out is pretty smooth, though you may have trouble getting it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first wall mount I&rsquo;ve ever used, and it really couldn&rsquo;t have been easier to install. It is a two person job in my opinion, especially when it comes to hanging the TV on the mounting arm. All the proper screws were included, and I have no worries about it&rsquo;s ability to hold my TV as as single stud mount. I have a 2012 model Samsung which is around 28 pounds and there is zero flexing with the mount. Pulling the TV in and out is pretty smooth, though you may have trouble getting it to collapse back completely unless you do it slowly. The only negative is the included HDMI cable, it is extremely stiff and I did not end up using it very long before finding a more flexible cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-movable-mount">Terrific movable mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The perfect single stud, 3 lag bolt wall mount for anyone with a 60&rdquo; TV. I had been using a strong flat mount with four lag bolts into a single stud but problems accessing the back and the inability to angle the TV became too much. Decided on the MD2379 because it was conservatively rated to 99 pounds, almost everyone testified to its strength, and four other reviewers had already used it to mount either 60&rdquo; or large and heavier plasma TVs. Mounting was easy and a hole drilling template is provided. This is the movable mount to buy if you have a large or heavy TV..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-quality-product">Easy to use, quality product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product. To say I am a novice may be a generous description of my skills. This mount has absolutely severe thing you need to get the job done. The instructions are simple to follow. I was shocked how much I liked the look of the tv on the wall. I will be buying another for another room in the house. Excellent product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-mount-and-easy-to-install">Solid mount and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We used this mount to place a 42&rdquo; LG LED TV, circa 2012, on our bedroom wall. The center of my bedroom happens to fall on a stud, which made mounting between two studs quite problematic from an aesthetics standpoint.The three lag bolts do hold this TV quite solidly and I am/would not be concerned about the stability of a lighter LED/LCD/Plasma at all, so long as you hit the stud.I am in the process of moving in and could not find my socket set. I&rsquo;d highly recommend having the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; socket/ratchet handy, as turning the center lag bolt about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of a turn at a time got really old, really quick.</p>
