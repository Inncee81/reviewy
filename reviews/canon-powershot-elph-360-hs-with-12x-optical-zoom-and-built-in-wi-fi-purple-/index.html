<p>12x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer helps you capture images with flexibility and ease</p>

<p>12x Optical Zoom
The PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera features a 12x Optical Zoom so spectacular shots are within your reach. You&rsquo;ll love the flexibility it gives you when shooting with an amazing range of 25–300mm (35mm equivalent) in a slim, compact camera. Plus, the wide-angle lens captures an expansive image in each shot, adding depth, perspective and grandeur. Landscapes, city scenes, family shots and more all benefit from the extra width. Whether you&rsquo;re shooting wide group shots or zooming to the telephoto end, your images can be bright and clear.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with select PowerShot cameras, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because these cameras are equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the ideal shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the Image Stabilizer is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Built-in Wi-Fi and NFC allows for easy sharing and transferring of images and videos</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi Technology Makes Sharing Quick and Easy

Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also designed to capture photos quickly and is capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling fast continuous shooting and autofocus.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera&rsquo;s functions and capabilities, including Hybrid Auto, Creative Shot and Full HD video shooting. Its processing speed creates fast, responsive performance for a shooting experience that&rsquo;s easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by up to 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This helps significantly reduce noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system can compensate for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The results are clear and sharp.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM Helps Provide Excellent Low-light Performance

The PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera captures Full HD video, for notably smooth, lifelike quality that is truly at home even on a large-screen HDTV. And now you can record in convenient MP4 format for easy online sharing.</p>

<p>Large 3.0-inch LCD enables easy viewing even from a wide angle
The large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of approximately 461,000 dots helps makes small details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle so showing others what you&rsquo;ve captured is easy, too.</p>

<p>Hybrid Auto lets you record up to four seconds of video before each image you capture, then automatically combines each clip and still into a quick video recap of the day
The PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera features Hybrid Auto, which records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions or any time you&rsquo;re shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this “highlight reel” can be stunningly beautiful. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to help capture incredibly high image quality. The resulting 1080p Full HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creative Shot mode uses composition, color and lighting from your original image to create unique images with an artistic flair
Not only is the PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera a stylish powerhouse, the camera also enables you to easily create artistic images with Creative Shot mode. In Creative Shot mode, the camera captures the original composition, automatically produces and saves five additional copies of the image and uses advanced Canon technologies to apply any of 46 filter options based on the individual scene, subject and exposure. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or you can simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result can lead to stunning artistic photos that are ideal for sharing.</p>

<p>Story Highlights enables the camera to automatically compile images and videos from a certain day or event into a mini highlight reel with music and effects
View your still images and video* as a fun short story with the Story Highlights feature on the PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera. You can choose to have the camera make one automatically, creating a short video of approximately three minutes** according to date, event or people, or you can customize your Story Highlights reel for a fun, unique video. Story Highlights BGM lets you add background music (choose from three pre-loaded songs) to the clips that Story Highlights automatically generates for a new level of emotive expression. It&rsquo;s all done in camera, without the need for any additional software. Easily access and enjoy your Story Highlights – simply press the Story Highlights button to start creating your highlight album. The Story Highlights album can be saved to the camera&rsquo;s memory card for quick replay and also shared with the PowerShot ELPH 360 HS camera&rsquo;s built-in Wi-Fi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From a day one aspect, it does what it is supposed to do. This is my 3rd Canon ELPH, previous models being the 110 HS and 330 HS.No discernable difference in picture quality when compared to my 330.Zoom has greatly improved, and has a bit better image stabilization vs the 330. MP4 has replaced the aged MOV format for videos.I am NOT a camera techie, and don&rsquo;t use half the features on this camera, but know a good picture when I see one, and one of the main things that impress me with the ELPH line is how great pictures and videos look when displayed on a large screen TV. That&rsquo;s the test for me&hellip; I&rsquo;ve purchased other models that failed, and were returned.It&rsquo;s true that today, many cellphones take WONDERFULL pictures and vids, but you are NOT going find the kind of zoom that point and shoots have. When on vacation, I&rsquo;d have to say 50% of my pictures involve the use of the zoom lens. Actual cameras are still relevant in today&rsquo;s cellphone centric world (at least for the time being).The REAL reason I upgraded this go around (my 330 is in excellent working condition) was that Canon FINALLY made MP4 the format for the 360&rsquo;s videos. Although previous versions took wonderful HD videos, you have no idea how frustrating it is to transfer a video to your phone, and having to convert it from MOV format first! Converting formats always involves a loss of quality, and I never understood why an Apple format had to be standard on a non-Apple device. MOV is an age old format and MP4 beats it hands down, and is playable on almost any PC or Android device.Nit-picking&hellip; this model has a flimsier battery/card door, and using the Wi-Fi feature I had to use &ldquo;manual&rdquo; steps to do so, as the &ldquo;auto&rdquo; feature would recognize the device, but not connect&hellip;. not a big thing, but would be nice if it would connect to devices as easily as cellphones do these days.Over all, I&rsquo;m quite happy with the camera, and feel the ELPH series offer the best pictures and smallest size in the compact point and shoot category. If it didn&rsquo;t&hellip;.I wouldn&rsquo;t be on my third model of the line. My first ELPH (110HS) is still working wonderfully 5 yrs later, the only reason I upgrade is for the improved features . I can&rsquo;t recommend this camera highly enough&hellip;it&rsquo;s GREAT.A piece of good advice is when buying a case&hellip;look for a hard/semi hard &ldquo;clamshell&rdquo; type case. My ELPHs look and act pristine after years of use, because they are well protected when being carried or not in use. Pouch style cases won&rsquo;t protect your camera from bumps or accidental drops, which I have encountered many times, and have had no ill effects due to the clam shell cases superior protection.Update 4-24-16Just got back from a Vegas trip, where this camera was use extensively. I had nose bleed seats at the T-Mobile Arena Guns n Roses concert. My 1080p cellphone camera could not capture stage action, as the low light filter does not work in zoom mode (all it could capture at full zoom was a blurry mess). Was able to get video with my HS 360 in zoom mode clear enough to actually capture facial expressions&hellip;.GREAT video, from some of the worst seats in a 40,000 seat arena. How can you beat that from an ultra compact point and shoot? When filming in full HD, I was getting about 45 mins a battery (I took 2 extra). Low light ability is A LOT better than my Note 4&rsquo;s camera. In DAYLIGHT&hellip;.my cellphone takes excellent pictures and video&hellip;.at NIGHT&hellip;.not so much. Glad I had this camera with me.If you are taking pictures, expect to get 300+ to a battery charge&hellip;.video, around 45-60 mins. Extra batteries are cheap and quite fast to change out when filming extensively&hellip;.well worth the money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I have only used this camera a bit but thought I would put up a first impression post now, and I will update it in a month or so. I am not a professional photographer but my main camera is a Cannon EOS Rebel T3 Canon EOS Rebel T3 Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (discontinued by manufacturer). I also have not fully read the instruction booklet yet either.Pros:&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;1) Small &amp; Light Weight: One of my co-workers tossed the box holding the camera to me and didn’t think there was a camera inside of it.2) Great Distance view: I will get a series of photographs I took during my lunch break from our back door. We are 0.7 miles from the cranes in the picture. I was able to get a good enough distance picture to read the manufacturers. I am not sure if I can do that on my Rebel T3 with just the normal lens.3) Filter Settings: I have not gone through all the settings yet. However, there is a setting where the camera will take 3+ pictures and change the filter automatically. I just took a picture of the texture on the ceiling to test this and it was pretty neat.Cons:&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;1) The first thing I noticed while taking pictures outside is that it is hard to see what you are shooting in the display screen. I tried taking pictures in the shade and direct sun and in both instances I really had to struggle to see.2) Close up images: I tried using this vs the camera in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone to take pictures of my Beta Fish tank at work. I found that out of 8 attempted shots only 2 came out non-blurry while using the cannon. I have purchased the same SD card that I would use for my Rebel T3 so that should not cause the delay .Overall so far I am happy. I am marking it at 4 for now but mattering how things change once I read the directions it might be lowered. If I am spending $200 on a camera I want it to work outside. I wanted this camera to ride in my purse on the go since I don’t always want to carry the bulky DSLR. SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB UHS-I/U3 SDHC Flash Memory Card with up to 95MB/s- SDSDXPA-032G-AFFP</p>

<p>Easy to take along on family outings and takes a clear, quality picture seconds after it leaves my bag. I love the setting that takes a short video before your snapshot.</p>
