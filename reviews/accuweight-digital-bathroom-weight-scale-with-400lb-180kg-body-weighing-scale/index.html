<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-fat-guys">Great for fat guys.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Being a large man (340lbs) I needed both a scale that would support my weight as well as be wide enough for me to stand on without having to perform a balancing act. Solid glass top. Sturdy build. Good display size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="spot-on-with-weight">Spot on with weight!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Spot on! Received this beautiful scale a couple of days ago and I had to go to the doctor yesterday for an appointment. While I was there they weighed me and it was exactly the same as my new scale at home. Needless to say I&rsquo;m very pleased!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wildly-inaccurate">Wildly inaccurate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scale is wildly inaccurate. I left it in the same spot, every day. For the first few days, it seemed okay. My weight was fluctuating anywhere from 2-5 pounds, which is not unheard of for females. I stepped on it again today after having it a whole week and change, and it showed me as being 20 pounds higher. I obviously didn&rsquo;t gain 20 pounds in an 8 hour period, so I tried it in a different spot, which showed an increase of 10 pounds. So I tried it in various places in my apartment, all on hardwood floor and tile. The variation is 160 pounds depending on the spot in my apartment, and my apartment isn&rsquo;t out of Lemony Snicket, the whole thing is approximately level.This scale is literally back in the original box, on it&rsquo;s way to the garbage tomorrow morning. Don&rsquo;t buy this unless you want to cause yourself unneeded anxiety trying to figure out your weight(for the record, my clothes actually fit better and if anything, I haven&rsquo;t gained 160 pounds over the course of walking through my apartment.In fact, in walking the thing back around my apartment to get pictures, I got weights as high as 290lbs, and up to the 0-Id error, which is now the only thing the scale will read. For the record, I&rsquo;m anywhere from 160-165 lbs, I&rsquo;ve attached a picture of myself so you can see for yourself.Really, don&rsquo;t bother with this scale. My anxiety didn&rsquo;t need this.As an edit to this, I took the battery out, waited 5 minutes, then put it back in. I stepped on the scale and it read 250 pounds, so I stepped off. Then I tried stepping on it again and it weighed 390 pounds, then it didn&rsquo;t zero out when I stepped off, but stayed on 195 pounds. I tried it one last time, and it started on 390, then went to 0-Id, which didn&rsquo;t leave the display until 3 minutes after I stepped off. I hate this scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-poor-accuracy">VERY POOR ACCURACY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WHAT I DON&rsquo;T LIKE1) Scale has VERY poor accuracy and repeatability. Will routinely indicate a 1-2 pound difference between sequential weighings, directly after each other!WHAT I LIKE1) The glass top is easy to clean2) I like the auto turn on feature, that senses when you step on the scale and automatically turns on. When you step off, it turns off.3) Low priceIf you&rsquo;re looking to save money, and only need a BALLPARK estimation of your weight, this is good. If you&rsquo;re looking for accuracy, do not buy. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-better-if-you-take-off-the-rubber-pads-from-underneath">Works better if you take off the rubber pads from underneath</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After six months I thought the scale broke because the weights would be really off. Then I turned it over to check the battery and saw that the four rubber feet that were glued to the bottom had shifted and were still glued on but off-kilter. I removed the rubber pads and peeled of the sticky glue. Now the scale is pretty precise, within 3 lbs depending where I stand on it. However the scale is kind of slippery now on my hardwood floor. If you try my fix be careful that you don&rsquo;t slip!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beautiful-accurate">Beautiful + Accurate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product is exactly as shown. Love the clear finish (fast &amp; easy to keep clean &amp; sanitary) and large read-results. We have only praise for the scale overall&hellip;our one drawback has to do with accuracy. It&rsquo;s completely and infallibility accurate - it&rsquo;s the same at our doctor. We were blissfully ignorant between annual physicals&hellip;our old scale would be off 7 lbs either way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="guess-your-weight">guess your weight?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scale looks nice but it isn&rsquo;t very accurate. For example: First reading was 185lbs. I stepped off the scale and tried again, weight was 192lbs, then I tried again and weighed 182lbs. My actual weight is approximately 195. I would understand it being off if the 3 different weights were consistent when I measured back to back for 3 consecutive attempts but since they were all different one right after the other I have to say I am very disappointed in this product. So, the best guess of my weight for this test was between 182-192. I didn&rsquo;t expect to GUESS my weight with the new scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-yourself-a-walmart-scale-you-d-be-better-off">Get yourself a Walmart scale, you&rsquo;d be better off&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I am doing something wrong but I&rsquo;m just confused with this scale. I put it on my tile floor in the bathroom and I stepped on it showed me my weight which was btw, 5 pounds more than my old scale. Then I get off wait few minutes step back on it shows me few pounds more, do this few times and each time it shows me different weight. Then my daughter steps on and it shows her heavier than me. So I gave up and showed it back under my bed. Back to my old scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this scale it&rsquo;s very thin but sturdy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-that-it-is-thin-easy-to-store-and-it">I Like that it is thin easy to store and it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I Like that it is thin easy to store and it looks good to if you just want to leave it out, it is very accurate when used properly if there is any slight indentation in the level&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great Buy!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! I was hesitant to buy it but I am so glad I did. I wanted to track my weight through this pregnancy and I am so beyond impressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-scale-it-is-cheap-and-accurate">This is a great scale. It is cheap and accurate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great scale. It is cheap and accurate. I weighted myself on this the same day I had a Doctor&rsquo;s appointment and it had the same readings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great thanks</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good</p>

<h5 id="varies-too-much-not-helpful">Varies too much. Not helpful.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shows +/- 3lb variation in a day for the exact same weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Scale needs new battery. Purchased tiny phillips set to remove screws. They are apparently glued in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-accurate">Not accurate&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the least accurate scales I&rsquo;ve ever purchased. After using it for almost a year, and it&rsquo;s always been resting on the floor (a flat surface), the fluctuation based&hellip;</p>
