<p>You want the best sound.
So we made our best soundbar.</p>

<p>Many people view soundbars as a common solution to space-saving home theater. But we don&rsquo;t aim for &ldquo;common.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The SoundTouch 300 soundbar offers the best performance, spaciousness and bass of any one-piece soundbar its size. Every cubic inch of it is packed with technologies that bring out the best in everything you listen to or watch. Custom drivers, proprietary QuietPort and PhaseGuide technology &hellip; and the feeling of hearing sounds where there are no speakers. It all adds up to a premium audio experience for all your entertainment.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the box</p>

<ul>
<li>Bose SoundTouch 300 soundbar</li>
<li>Universal remote</li>
<li>2 AAA batteries</li>
<li>ADAPTiQ headset</li>
<li>Power cord</li>
<li>HDMI cable</li>
<li>Optical cable</li>
<li>Bose Acoustimass 300 Wireless Bass Module</li>
</ul>

<p>Love your new SoundTouch soundbar but want to kick the performance up a notch?</p>

<p>Add the Acoustimass 300 wireless bass module it&rsquo;s the difference between hearing bass and feeling thunder. Designed exclusively for the SoundTouch 300 soundbar, it&rsquo;s the best Acoustimass module we&rsquo;ve ever designed for any of our home theater systems. In fact, it&rsquo;s the best performance you can get for a subwoofer this size. It connects wirelessly to the soundbar and provides a more immersive experience for everything you listen to or watch.</p>

<p>A STATEMENT IN SOUND AND STYLE</p>

<p>With its premium glass-top finish, the Acoustimass 300 wireless module offers a sophisticated look you won&rsquo;t find in typical subwoofers or home theater equipment. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t typical equipment. This newly designed subwoofer delivers a dynamic range of bass from a powerful driver and generously sized port with QuietPort technology that virtually eliminates distortion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic sound but with problems. Soundtouch 300 is so good that I just couldn&rsquo;t send it back despite the sound syncing problem. One can do without the woofer but I kept that too because the base it adds to special effect movies is thrilling. The sound sync changes with almost each program so you need to keep playing with the sync setting to try and get it right. Unfortunately the sync rang setting offered is not always wide enough to achive a desired sync but it&rsquo;s close enough. I have no problem with the often talked about failed ARC HDMI connection to the TV, which is LG OLED. I have both the optical cable and ARC HDMI connection cables hooked up and I switch between the two to select the best sound sync I can get. Yes it is sort of disappointing but it was time for me to retire my old Bose Acoustimas system and Sonos didn&rsquo;t do it for me so it is this that I got.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tested a couple of bars at home. I ordered a couple and kept the one I liked the most. It is hard to test in the stores because the soundbar reacts different in their showroom versus your living room.I compared the following:Yamaha YSP-3300Sonos PLAYBAR TV Soundbar w/ subBose SoundTouch 300 Soundbar w/ subAnd for a “budget” soundbar, the Samsung HW-K550I will first start with the Samsung HW-K550. For $300, this is a great bar. It doesn’t sound as good as the others but at 1/5th the cost it wasn’t a fair comparison to be begin with. If you are on a limited budget or maybe want a soundbar in a spare bedroom, this is definitely one you want to take a look at. But for now, onto the almost $1500 sound bars.The Yamaha YSP-3300. Setup was easy. I liked the 4 HDMI ports on the bar so I can run all my devices through that, have the bar do all the sound processing and output video just to the TV. I watched Terminator: Genisys as a test. The sound was amazing. I don’t know how it does it but it makes sound come from behind me even through there it is just a bar sitting at the front. Everything was good until I tried 4k content. Even through Yamaha claims it supports 4k Pass Through, this was false advertising. None of my 4k devices would pass video through the bar. I found out from Yamaha that the bar does not support HDCP 2.2, which is needed for full 4k support. So back in the box and returned.I will review the Bose SoundTouch 300 and the Sonos PLAYBAR TV in the same thought. It is basically comparing apples with a slight different apple. Price is the same. Features are basically the same. Clarity I will give it to Bose. Bass, I will also give it to Bose. As far as surround, I can tell both bars “try” to make sounds come from behind but you know it is faking it (virtual surround). No bar will ever be able to get you that full surround sound like a real 5.1 (or 7.1) setup would give you, that’s just a fact, but both bars give it a nice try. Using the same movie, I could tell these bars sounded much better than the Yamaha. I ended up keeping the Bose because of the slightly better clarity, better bass response, and the main reason; Full 4k HDCP 2.2 support. While Bose does not advertise this at all, the 2 HDMI ports (HDMI in and HDMI ARC) both fully support HDCP 2.2. Unlike the Yamaha YSP-3300 which claims 4k support but not really. I just wish there were more ports on the Bose. I prefer to run my devices through the bar, have it do all the audio processing and then pass the video to the TV. I may pick up an external 4 port HDMI switcher that supports HDCP 2.2 to resolve this issue.If the Bose had 4 HDMI in ports this would be a 5 star review, but as it is, 4 stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 Star sound, 4 Star setup, 3 Star app, and expensive.First thing, download the users guide from Bose&rsquo;s website. The instructions provided in the box are lacking but the expanded user guide provides a good step by step setup. The setup went fairly smoothly and the auto calibration is a nice feature. I tried the HDMI ARC setup but it was shutting the system down when I changed sources. To be honest there were more options to try with ARC on the TV, but I just went to the optical setup which works great with my universal remote. I did have to reset the Bose to switch from ARC to optical. No issues with WIFI or Bluetooth.The app is good for listening to Internet radio (it automatically finds the local stations) and your music over WIFI and Bluetooth. The app on my computer allows me to share my iTunes library over WIFI. But the app isn&rsquo;t a full function remote which prevents me from using my iPhone to be a universal remote to control all my system devices. At a minimum the app should let you select the TV as a source, but it doesn&rsquo;t. Inconvenient but hopefully they can add this feature.The sound is uncompromising. Classical, rock, vocals, acoustic all sound fantastic - as if the artists were in the room. TV/Movie sound is great too and has a mode to enhance dialog that we really like. The system especially shines at loud volumes delivering crisp, spatially distributed non-distorted sound with room filling bass (I have the bass module) when called for. A truly fantastic compact sound system.The biggest drawback is the price. If you don&rsquo;t do critical listening or do not listen to music or TV at louder volumes, then there are (much) cheaper options that will be fine - including other Bose products.</p>
