<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="top-of-the-line-tv-mount">Top of the line TV mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have all our TV&rsquo;s hanging on the wall but, needed our 50&rsquo; Vizio to be movable so could be seen in the living room and kitchen. Installation of the bracket was very easy .I&rsquo;d probably say between 30 and 45 minutes. The surge protector and cables were really a bonusehe bracket comes with two sizes of bolts and worked perfect for our televisions.. We have thoroughly enjoyed it . I enjoy the fact that it can move into and out from the wall. This will allow us to place it flesh up against the wall when we need more space in the living room or move it out when we feel we want the tv from a different part of the room. The swivel feature is also really nice as this will allow us to move our furniture around and not have to worry about where the tv is and if we can see it from the new location. This is a 5 star product in our family&rsquo;s book for sure.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-believe-the-quality-i-got-for-the-money">Can&rsquo;t believe the quality I got for the money!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoy receiving a item where it&rsquo;s clear that the manufacturer make, packed and shipped a item like they really care about the customer experience. This thing had a leveler built into the mounting plate and provide a separate in the box. It had every possible screw size you could possibly need to fit with the advertised compatible tv brands. It fit into my 43&rdquo; Sharp with surprise ease. The engineering design had the same forward customer freindly thinking built into design. First it was substantial not some thin metal unable to hold any weight. Second, the swing and title were intuitive and uncomplicated. Best of all, the Best Buy model that didn&rsquo;t hsve all these features was 5x more expensive.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-amazing-for-me-i-didn-t-know-what-i-was-missing">This is amazing, for me. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was missing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally!! OK, so I know these have been around for a while, but We bought a Mount that you can&rsquo;t move your T.v. and now with everything that you have that needs to hook to the back of the t.v. like Amazon firesticks , or game counsels this is a life saver for me when My husband isn&rsquo;t home and i can&rsquo;t lift the t.v. off the stupid mount. So this is amazing!!! I just can pull it out from the wall to hook stuff up, it was very easy to install and quick! It came with a HDMI cable which we didn&rsquo;t think we needed but ended up we did and it was super helpful!</p>

<h5 id="the-laws-of-physics-do-not-bend">The laws of Physics do not bend&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product for small to mid-range flat screens, but gets iffy when you use the larger televisions. They claim a maximum size of 55&rdquo; to be mounted. My flat screen is 52&rdquo;, and weighs 58lbs. This is a question of physics. There are THREE articulating points, with attachments to the TV that are VERY close to each other. A large flat screen puts a tremendous amount of torque and stress on the single joint closest to the TV. It bounces and sways, and loses its level when pushed all the way to one side or the other. Consider this, or you will see!</p>

<h5 id="we-love-our-new-tv-wall-mount">we love our new tv wall mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>we love our new tv wall mount! it was easy to set up and sturdy enough for our 39 inches 📺what i like about this is that you can adjust it accordingly which is perfect when you always re-arrange the furnitures! you don&rsquo;t have to re-screw the mount&mdash; just adjust it to the desired angle and you&rsquo;re done.ill definitely be buying another one of this to use on my son&rsquo;s bedroom!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often review products unless something has a fatal flaw I need to warn buyers of. But I have to say that this mount is incredible, especially given the price. It exceeded my expectations, even though I had read many Amazon reviews. It will strong and well made and easy to assemble and mount. I mounted a 70&rdquo; LCD (Vizio M70-D3) which is 60lbs with absolutely no issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So this is awesome! Not only does it come with a level on it, it comes with and hdmi cable! This is very sophisticated setup, the devise is very sturdy and reliable. I will buy a few more for our other televisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-sturdy">Very sturdy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very sturdy and I love the rotation of it! My husband however did not like putting it together as the directions were confusing and it took about an hour just to get through it which is why I&rsquo;m giving 4 stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The product and the surge suppressors are great. Works very well for our needs. But, the screen cleaner is not good at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-wall-mount">Good quality wall mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A good heavy duty wall mount. Really good quality. Unfortunately my wall beams are too far apart to use this mount. My fault for not realizing that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="won-t-hold-tv-s-on-the-upper-range">Won&rsquo;t hold TV&rsquo;s on the Upper Range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mounted a 70&rdquo; Sony TV on it and it feels like it doesn&rsquo;t hold the weight. It is very hard to align/adjust the TV straight.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-great-product">Great quality great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered it for my 65&rdquo; Samsung curved TV . It was easy to assemble the directions are easy to understand the TV is very secure I will definitely buy from them again</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it-for-the-adjustability">Worth it for the adjustability.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great. Everything was included to mount it to my wall. I liked the fact that you can hang your TV on the support brackets. You mount the vertical supports on your TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-okay-if-you-are-here-for-the-price-of-it">It&rsquo;s okay if you are here for the price of it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay&hellip; the handle which holds the TV was not horizontal and it makes my tv look little tilted towards left side. It you are here for the price, then okay.</p>

<h5 id="the-extensions-are-a-little-stiff-when-manipulating-the-tv">The extensions are a little stiff when manipulating the TV &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The extensions are a little stiff when manipulating the TV on the wall but all in all it&rsquo;s a TV mount so it does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do it&rsquo;s very heavy though I must say.</p>
