<p>Style Name:Deluxe Tool Tower with Casters
Product Description
Keep all of your tools organized in one place with the Rubbermaid Deluxe Tool Tower Rack. This tool storage organizer has enough space to store up to 40 tools, including long-handled garden tools, brooms, shovels and more. Front clips allow head-down storage and ensures stability. For easy transport, four castors help move tools to where you need them. No tools needed for assembly.</p>

<p>Amazon.com
Store and organize over 36 tools for easy access and more floor space with this garden tool rack organizer from Rubbermaid. The tool tower stores rakes, brooms, snow shovels, and gas-powered weed eaters for easy access and more floor space in the garage or shed. Front clips allow head-down storage of spades and brooms to simplify access and so that the rack doesn&rsquo;t get top heavy. The clips also enable easy slide-in storage from the side, rather than having to come in from above and sliding the handle into the slot. Four castors mean easy transport of all those tools from one place to another&ndash;a feature that makes it easy to relocate all those tools in one easy move, rather than 36 moves. Two of the casters lock to keep the unit in place. The base of the tower has a grid pattern to keep tools from sliding off. &ndash;Brian D. Olson</p>

<h5 id="i-m-very-disappointed-with-this">I&rsquo;m very disappointed with this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very disappointed with this. The reviews cannot be real. Very flimsy and within a couple of days the plastic was bending, the whole thing was leaning and looks like it is going to topple over. Notice I have about 25 items on it but many are light brooms, poles, etc. I would return if still had packaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="caster-holes-too-big">Caster Holes too Big</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just built a shed and wanted something that could hold my backyard tools together in a more organized fashion. I wanted something that I could easily move around outside the shed with the casters that are on the bottom. In this review, I’ll try to answer some of the questions that have been asked.The tower rack was pretty sturdy and was easy to assemble minus the fact that the casters fit in the holes at the bottom, but wouldn’t stay. (In the picture they are there because they stay there, but once you move it, they fall out) The casters are meant to just pop right into a predesigned hole. Almost like the holes were too big for the casters. From my understanding, you can place the tools in there one of two ways. One way is straight from the top. Just slide down into place. That’s not really the best method to do it if it’s in a shed due to lack of height. The other way, if I’m not mistaken is to go through the side. Going through the side is a bit difficult. Maybe the tools I have (mainly husky), are too wide in diameter. It was tough to push through the side. It advertises 40 tools, but I think comfortable I could probably fit half of that. (See posted pictures)The dimensions of this tower was 20.5&rdquo; D x 38&rdquo; W x 34.4&rdquo; H and is meant for indoors, but it could be outdoors. The only problem with that is I think the sun (living in Arizona), ends up destroying/weakening the plastic over time. When used inside, the heat won’t melt the plastic but when the sun takes its toll on it, it would weaken the integrity of the structure, which may cause it to break or bend. And last but not least, it doesn’t appear to be able to attach to any walls. If it is top heavy it may come down, but it seems pretty sturdy to me.</p>

<h5 id="absolute-plastic-p-o-s-poor-design">Absolute Plastic P.O.S., Poor Design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write all that many negative reviews, but when I truly HATE a product, I feel compelled to warn others.I&rsquo;m at a complete loss to understand how my experience with this product is so different than others, who seem to love it.According to the product description, it &ldquo;holds 40 tools&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve only got about 20-25 items in it, none of them overly heavy, and the rack bottom has sagged so low in the middle it won&rsquo;t even roll along the floor any longer. The vertical risers have also bent. I looks as if I put an entire olympic free weight set into the rack, which I would EXPECT to distort it&rsquo;s shape so much. But, just like the product pictures, I&rsquo;ve only put light-weight poles, rods, and tools in the rack.See attached photo. Looks crowded, but most of the &ldquo;tools&rdquo; are plastic, wood or aluminum (i.e. light weight). Note the sag in the base, and the contortions in the vertical risers.I hope this review helps at least one person avoid the frustration I&rsquo;ve experienced with this 1-star product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk">Junk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give a zero so 1 will have to suffice. This product looks good at first glance but as soon as I started loading tools in it I notice a big issue. The ceiling in my shed is low so I have to roll it outside to load or unload tools. Thats when I ran into the real problem. The whole thing is held together by gravity so if you pick up on any part of it parts start popping off. Then the entire thing goes over in a heap. Try to put it back together when it is loaded with tools. Don&rsquo;t walk, run away from this thing. If you have six light tools like in the picture it might be good for you but I decided to just lean the tools up agains the wall in the shed like I have been doing for 20 years. Its easier and less hassle, oh and its free. Since I had mine to long and could not send it back I just cut it up and recycled it. Truly trash.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-looks-awesome-but-i-don-t-have-this-thing-completely-filled">it looks awesome. But I don&rsquo;t have this thing completely filled &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros - It holds a lot of tools, really get&rsquo;s things organizedThe tool can go tool up, or tool down which makes it easier to get the tools outCons - If you get a good load in it, it will not moveWheels need to be betterStructure itself is weak when loadedI don&rsquo;t have this thing completely filled yet and already it won&rsquo;t roll on the cheap plastic wheels, it&rsquo;s more like dragging. And you can&rsquo;t grab it by the top and try to pull/drag it, the thing looks like its going to break the supports in half when you do that. You have to grab it down low where the supports go into the base. Luckily I can get away with pretty much putting it in that corner and leaving it, that may not be an option for everyone. If you have 10 or 20 tools I believe your are good, but this thing boasts 40 some tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="inexpensive-storage-solution-for-your-shed">Inexpensive storage solution for your shed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This corner tool rack fits nicely into the corner of my shed and hold all the lawn tools that have been scattered willy-nilly for years.It has a low profile, so you have to make sure it is tight to the shed walls. I loaded it up with shovels, rakes, trimmers, brooms, pruners, thatchers, weed whips, etc and it is not showing any sign of tipping. It is smaller, so you may have to remove tools in the front to get to tools at the back. Pack the rack with this in mind.Set up was a breeze, it took about 30 seconds to assemble.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="price-is-too-high-but-it-works">price is too high, but it works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is easy to assemble, and effectively makes storage mobile. However it is not the highest of quality. If you don&rsquo;t drag this around everywhere it will last you fine. Keep away from small children if you want it to last, but that is everything. Even an M1 Abrams (military battle tank) can be utterly destroyed by toddlers given fifteen minutes or so.Mine is still intact because the kids have yet to tunnel into my garage. However the reason I rated it only three stars is the quality. I could have bought non-name brand for half the price and ended up with the same design. It just is not worth the money spent, despite it working as advertised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="couldn-t-be-more-satisfied-great-produce">Couldn&rsquo;t be more satisfied&hellip; great produce.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been searching for something to help keep my yard equipment easy to find and store. This tool tower was just what I needed. I found it to be well made and sturdy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-a-downsized">Perfect for a downsized</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cart can store a lot of tools in a small space. Perfect for a downsized home</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-your-garage-need-organizing-consider-this">Does your garage need organizing &ndash; consider this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How did I live without this organizing rack for my garage. It holds numerous items and keeps them off the floor. Easy to assemble. Love this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="miners-shop-elsewhere-it-works">Miners shop elsewhere; it works&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading some of the reviews, I thought perhaps it might be too flimsy; however, it&rsquo;s not. I was able to store, at least, 30 items on it without any issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product, holds plenty of stuff. I didn&rsquo;t install the casters</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="got-me-organized">Got me organized.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving five stars now because it fit all my garden tools just like the description said. I just hope it hold up under the weight of it all but it sure did get me organized.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="holes-are-too-small-to-hold-most-things">Holes are too small to hold most things.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what people are putting in this storage unit but the holes are too small for virtually anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="puzzled">Puzzled</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed at the number of reviewers who complained that the rack wasn&rsquo;t sturdy when tools were put into it since I can&rsquo;t get the poles into the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it">I love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has helped me so much by having a place to put EVERYTHING that has to do with yard work, in one place. I love it.</p>
