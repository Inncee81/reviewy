<h5 id="unique-style-b-o-signature-sound">Unique style, B&amp;O signature sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own several B&amp;O products, and I find virtually all of them to be masterpieces of design and performance. I was therefore excited to try B&amp;O&rsquo;s new Beosound 1 product - and so far it hasn&rsquo;t disappointed.B&amp;O is known for their upscale, clean and minimalist design, and the Beosound 1 is a prime example. The conically shaped Beosound 1 looks cool and unlike anything else out there, but at the same time, it&rsquo;s not so far out there as to look odd in your room. The high-quality metallic exterior is a brushed stainless steel finish - very attractive. It&rsquo;s also quite &ldquo;solid&rdquo; and not at all flimsy - just exactly like a high quality speaker should be. From the product photo, it&rsquo;s hard to get a sense of the size, but I found it to be smaller than I expected it to be.The top part of the speaker houses volume and other controls, but they&rsquo;re invisible, giving the speaker an uncluttered and smooth look top to bottom and all around. The controls are 3D - push down to switch tracks, roll left/right for volume and swipe the top. Although they work well, I find myself seldom using the controls at the speaker - it&rsquo;s usually easier to adjust the sound at whatever source you&rsquo;re using. Underneath are recessed cutouts for the power cable and if you prefer, wired Ethernet. I like that you have the option of running a wired Ethernet cable to the speaker - this helps you get top performance, even if you&rsquo;re in an area of marginal WiFi.In terms of connectivity, pretty much anything you might want is included. You can use it like a Bluetooth speaker, connecting pretty much any app from any computer or mobile device. For Apple fans, you can use AirPlay over WiFi, so you&rsquo;re covered from any computer or Apple mobile device. There&rsquo;s also DLNA support, and much to my surprise, the B&amp;O mobile app discovered some of my home entertainment devices as DLNA sources, allowing me to stream audio directly from these devices to the Beosound 1. There&rsquo;s also built-in support for Spotify, Deezer and TuneIn - although with Bluetooth, you can pretty much run any app you want and stream the audio to the Beosound 1.There are a lot of connectivity options, but the good thing is that virtually everything connects in a trouble-free way and performs well. Unlike some other brands I&rsquo;ve tried, both the Bluetooth and WiFi based protocols were perfect, with not even a single drop out in many hours of playing. Of course, if you have marginal WiFi, you might not have the same experience - but even there, it&rsquo;s nice to know that you can always run your speaker over Ethernet to eliminate these issues.Setup is simple using B&amp;O&rsquo;s app. I used the iOS version on an iPhone, and setup took just a few moments. B&amp;O works with Apple&rsquo;s advanced AirPlay setup, allowing your WiFi information in your mobile device to be automatically shared with the Beosound 1 - you don&rsquo;t even need to know the WiFi password. Bottom line is that it worked like a champ, only taking a few minutes from opening the box to music. If you&rsquo;re only planning on using Bluetooth (that is, no AirPlay, etc), then you can even skip this part - turn it on and connect via Bluetooth&hellip;no setup needed.One small criticism is that the Beosound 1 requires a different app than many of B&amp;O&rsquo;s other wireless speakers. If you have a Beosound in one room and (say) an M5 or Beolit in another, you need both apps. Fortunately, once setup, there&rsquo;s really little need to use the app on a regular basis - you just connect to whichever speaker you want.Of course, a speaker in this price range needs to sound good. Here are my thoughts.First, if you want the best sound, you&rsquo;ll want to experiment with placement - this is a speaker that sounds different, depending on where you put it. Placed against a wall or in a corner, you get relatively more bass in exchange for a more &ldquo;compressed&rdquo; sound. Placed in the middle of the room, it&rsquo;s an open/airy sound, but with slightly less bass. You&rsquo;ll also want to let it &ldquo;break in&rdquo; for a while - I found mine to sound a little dry right out of the box, but with 8-10 hours of playing, it definitely warmed up.A unique feature of the Beosound 1 is the 360 degree radiation pattern it has. Most speakers tend to beam sound across a narrow band, creating a &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; where the sound is optimal. With the Beosound, B&amp;O went a different way, projecting sound equally in all directions to eliminate any sense of beamy sound. If you put the Beosound 1 in the middle of a room, you can walk around the speaker and not hear peaks and valleys in highs or lows. The Beosound 1 does this better than perhaps any speaker I&rsquo;ve heard. It&rsquo;s not a stereo effect (that is, if you close your eyes, you can tell you&rsquo;re listening to a single speaker), but it gives you the same sound no matter where you are in relation to the speaker.I&rsquo;ve found B&amp;O products to usually feature a very neutral, uncolored sound, and the Beosound 1 is no exception. If you&rsquo;re used to inexpensive speakers that often have muddy bass and artificial, shrill highs, the Beosound 1 will sound a little cold and sterile at first. But then you start noticing all the nuances you never heard before, and you realize you&rsquo;re hearing music like it was meant to be heard. The onboard amplifiers carry a lot of punch too - the Beosound will fill most rooms with lots of clean sound, and they don&rsquo;t mind being pushed to loudness levels that most people would find uncomfortable.From B&amp;O, I also own the Beosound 2, Beolit 17, M5 and A9 speakers, plus I have a few wireless speakers from Bose, Martin-Logan and JBL. In the B&amp;O line, I&rsquo;d say the sound quality of the Beosound 1 fits somewhere between the M5 and the A9, especially if you listen in a larger room or need to crank up the volume. To my ear, it&rsquo;s way better than anything I&rsquo;ve heard from Bose (I don&rsquo;t like their muddy, incoherent bass), and actually very similar to the Martin-Logan Crescendo. If you have a good ear, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to audition the Beosound 1 live&hellip;if you like high-end sound, you&rsquo;ll prefer the A9, although it&rsquo;s twice the price - it has a clarity and punch that no other wireless speaker I&rsquo;ve found can match.One thing I like about B&amp;O&rsquo;s overall line of wireless speakers is that they all have similar sound&hellip;I can see putting different speakers in different rooms and ending up with an overall environment that&rsquo;s uniform and consistent sounding as you go from room to room. This is really hard to do with most manufacturer&rsquo;s products.In summary, B&amp;O&rsquo;s Beosound 1 is a convenient and high performance wireless speaker that should work with just about anything you want to send it. It gets design points for it&rsquo;s unique style, and it offers reasonable sound quality for a speaker in this price range. Definitely worth an audition if you&rsquo;re shopping for a high quality wireless speaker, and I&rsquo;d have no trouble recommending it along with it&rsquo;s B&amp;O siblings.</p>

<p>I ordered the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beosound2 and I am totally impressed and extremely delighted with this masterpiece. Powerful sound that is clear and covers wide areas. So powerful that my apartment went from quiet to Boom Boom in a second. The walls were vibrating. Never saw a speaker do this and with that level of quality and clearness.The design itself is a masterpiece. Very stylish, with a stainless steel look. You might think it&rsquo;s a lamp, a robot, or something out of this planet. Combines a modern, minimalist look all in this high end loud speaker.It is expensive. But after playing with this for hours and listening to my most favorite music, changing stations and turning the volume up and down I&rsquo;m amazed and I would definitely pay every penny for this.The box includes quick instructions of use, and warranty but NO users manual is included. There is only a website link reference on a side of the box for you to learn. I read and searched for apps in IPhone and found several apps you can use this with. I haven&rsquo;t downloaded all of them yet, because you first need to create an account on their website. That&rsquo;s why I wrote before you need to go to the website and see the users guide. You will register your Beosound 2 online and follow all instructions. Then if you have a smart TV you can also download and have a better experience with more options. But again, I haven&rsquo;t gone so far.You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to create an account and download the program on your computer or tv to use it. So to get started, just follow this. This is what I did, I have an IPhone. I turned this on. To do that, first plug your speaker and tap on the black area on top. Don&rsquo;t be scared if the light (that looks like a laser) turns red. I believe it&rsquo;s normal and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;charging&rdquo;. This will stop after a minute and it will turn blue. When it&rsquo;s blue it&rsquo;s all ready to use. Go to your IPhone settings- Bluetooth and wait until &ldquo;Other Devices&rdquo; show up. You will see BeoSound 2 and click it. You will hear a sound from the speaker and now you can start streaming your music.I believe it will be the same for Android phones. Go to phone settings and then Bluetooth and look for Beosound2.Once done that, you can listen to your music, tv programs, radio station, etc. Remember this is a speaker, and you will need to use with other devices in order to operate. This is not AM FM.Functions are invisible to the eye and the only way to control this is either with your phone or tapping the top area. To change stations or tracks, tap twice. To turn volume up or down, move slightly the top to the right or left. To turn on or off, just tap once.As a high end loud speaker, you won&rsquo;t want to take this outdoors. It&rsquo;s design is so elegant and modern that can be part of a very nice home decoration. No matter where you put this, floor, table, corner, etc, the sound will be impeccable.From now on I am a fan of Bang &amp; Olufsen products and can&rsquo;t wait to see what else they have.I&rsquo;m grateful and applaud the engineering and design of the Bang and Olufsen creators for its excellence.I will post a video with updates as soon as I start using the Apps and download the program in my computer.</p>

<h5 id="crazy-expensive-but-crazy-good">Crazy-expensive, but crazy-good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own several Bang &amp; Olufsen products - four headphone sets and two wireless speakers - and have high expectations for any B&amp;O product that comes into my home.The BeoSound 2 wireless speaker definitely does not dissapoint.Yes, at $1,895 it&rsquo;s crazy-expensive. But it&rsquo;s also crazy-good.I&rsquo;ve spent several days searching for the best way to describe its incredible performance and in the end, it comes down to the defining characteristic of all of my other B&amp;O products - clarity. It has a clarity of sound that shows you every subtlety and nuance of your music all the way from a whisper to room-filling, window-rattling maximum volume. The sound never gets muddy - the bass is rich and fat where it&rsquo;s supposed to be and the highs have a crisp clarity that defies description.As another reviewer said, nobody NEEDS a $1,895 wireless speaker, but if you have the great good fortune to be able to afford the BeoSound 2, you won&rsquo;t regret it.And besides, it looks so Danish modern cool.If I have any complaint, it&rsquo;s that the speaker comes with little documentation and I&rsquo;m still trying to puzzle out how to network it, but that&rsquo;s between me and the learning curve.</p>
