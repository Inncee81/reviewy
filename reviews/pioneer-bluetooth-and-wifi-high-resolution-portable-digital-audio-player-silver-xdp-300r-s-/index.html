<h5 id="i-ve-grown-to-love-it">I&rsquo;ve grown to love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did not purchase this item from Amazon but from a certain online marketplace &ndash; and I saved over $100.This is my third DAP. My previous purchases were both ibasso players, first the DX-50 and then the DX-80. I went with ibasso initially because Apple had just discontinued the iPod classic, and after searching online for a substitute I learned I could do a lot better than another iPod.I was happy with my more recent ibasso &ndash; the DX-80 &ndash; but ultimately unsatisfied. The tipping point came when I purchased a pair of Grado RS2Es. I could barely hear any difference from the Sennheiser 598s I graduated from. That made zero sense to me and left me suspicious.So I impulse purchased this after maybe an hour&rsquo;s worth of research. I wasn&rsquo;t willing to go over $500, hence I did not use Amazon.Initially &ndash; I had buyers remorse. This thing is basically a phone minus the phone. Sure, I read about the android OS in my research &ndash; but ibasso also uses an android based OS. I think that part is pretty standard with these players. However, ibasso&rsquo;s system is barebones whereas this is full-blown why-did-i-get-this-when-i-already-have-a-phone? The answer, obviously, is that your phone doesn&rsquo;t play dsd or flac or whatever high-end format they&rsquo;ll dream up next. Also, high-res audio files can take up a lot of room.All my fears crumbled and fell away when I started listening. It&rsquo;s not that my previous players lacked depth or soundstage, but the Pioneer blows them away. Also, I think the ibasso&rsquo;s were more neutral sounding. I know Grado&rsquo;s have a reputation for a warmer sound &ndash; but I own a small fleet of headphones and I can safely tell you the audio from this DAP is much more nuanced compared to my previous players.As for the things you should definitely be aware of before purchasing this player:Do three minutes of research and you&rsquo;ll find someone criticizing the battery life. This complaint is legit. You&rsquo;re going to want to keep it in Airplane mode just to get some decent usage hours out of it.Next, this player is a Japanese import and as such &ndash; service (to my knowledge) and accessories come from Japan. For example &ndash; the pleather case is $60. Ridiculous.It takes a bit longer to boot up than you&rsquo;d expect &ndash; maybe 15-20 seconds. It&rsquo;s annoying but not unbearable.Lastly &ndash; I recommend picking up a 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter so you can use the balanced input jack (unless you already own balanced headphones).I think this is a pretty great player, especially if you can find it at a better (currently $600) price. Now that I have this Pioneer I am content &ndash; my quest for that elusive &lsquo;perfect sound&rsquo; is done. For now.</p>

<h5 id="great-player-so-far-jury-is-still-out-on-the-battery-life">Great player so far, jury is still out on the battery life&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, player, O/S, design, quality seems great! The instructions could use some updating, and the customer support could use some work. I didn&rsquo;t have it a week and somehow I cracked the screen in my pocket(very minor crack albeit), only other thing in my pocket was my iPhone 7 so go figure. I&rsquo;m not sure if glass is weak or just bad luck. I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to get it replaced and I can&rsquo;t seem to get anywhere besides sending it to Japan. The other con I have is the battery runs down in 2-3 hours, I&rsquo;m also not sure yet but this could be me and my settings since I&rsquo;m still learning to use. A big Pro is the dual DACs in balanced mode provides such phenomenal sound with balanced headphones! - The main reason for purchasing! I will continue to update the more I use it.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-dap-but-there-are-challenges">A great DAP, but there are challenges</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a music library that has about 2700 tracks that I manage using Media Monkey on my PC. This library is a mixture of high rez (FLAC &amp; Wav), MP3 and iTunes mv4 formats. Now, my 64gb iPod is nearly full and produces mediocre sound with the lousy compressed formats that it supports. Recently I purchased this Pioneer player (not from Amazon) and have been re-experiencing my music. Even the MP3s sound better! This is a serious audio player, and I only wish the rest of my portable equipment could do it justice.That said, there are some drawbacks that I am trying to resolve. The most frustrating issue is trying to connect the player to my 2017 Honda CR-V&rsquo;s audio system. The car&rsquo;s system supports USB connections, but it will not recognize the XDP-300R. Google offers a USB configuration app for connecting devices to auto sound systems, but indicates that the XDP-300R is not compatible with it (for some reason). Also, the CR-V does not come with AUX inputs so that option is not available. Right now, bluetooth is the only way I can play the device in my car. Bluetooth is highly compressed and is easily distorted by interference (aptX is supported by the the XDP-300R, but not the car). Right now, I&rsquo;m exploring other options.Also, the Android release is 5.1.1. This is a bit old. So far, this seems okay, but it doesn&rsquo;t bode well for future enhancements. On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t know of any DAP that implements a more current version of Android. My other gripe (though small) is that the music app that comes installed on the XDP-300R is the Onkyo music player - not the professional music player that they offer on Google Play for a purchase. I prefer to use Media Monkey for Android because of its sync functions.All in all, I highly recommend this device, and am glad to see that we are finally moving away from MP3 to real quality audio is portable players.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) Respects &amp; Thanks to PONO (RIP)The XDP-300 is a great device! And for those us from the Pono World, it’s a worthy successor! Beautiful, rich and crisp acoustics that leave you captivated. It provides that shine and feel of an updated and upgraded technology. Completely customizable from cosmetics to sound, you pretty much have a lot of options. It’s the customization that allows to squeeze every drop from the battery. (Disable and turn off everything that sucks juice.) But even if you left it alone, the basics are more than enough to satisfy. Love that “crossfade”.Any new comer or those already invested in Hi-Res, will be happy with this fantastic piece of music gear. It serves so many needs (Wow)!It’s all about the sound of music.</p>

<h5 id="did-extensive-research-and-this-is-the-one">Did extensive research and this is the one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this is as a gift for my boyfriend. He is really into music. Music library is so large it won&rsquo;t fit on a standard phone. Needed something specific for his hobby that also had the ability to play multiple music files types and had the ability to expand the memory. Did my research and it was this vs the fiiO. X5 3rd gen. Thought that was the bettter option and the price was great!! I would recommend this to anyone who has a massive music library.</p>
