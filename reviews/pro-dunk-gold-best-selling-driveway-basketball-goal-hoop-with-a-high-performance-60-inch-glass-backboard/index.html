<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="lots-of-good-reviews">Lots of good reviews?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting, all of these reviews and not one verified purchase. And, all of them coming in from people who have no more than a max of 2 reviews, all within a week’s time, and not one review that is not 5 stars. Hmmmmmmmmmm&hellip;What they do is they actually pull their entire product listing every few months or every year, once they get enough bad reviews. Don’t believe me? Why is the exact same goal from a few months ago “Currently Unavailable”? It’s the exact same goal as this one, but you’ll notice the unflattering reviews about the rusting.How do they do this? Well, being the only company that actually sells their product, they just mark a “model number” as discontinued, then they just add a “new product number”, and start a “new” product page for a “new” goal. Clever little trick, really. Well, one day Amazon will hopefully catch on to this. They work hard to get rid of third party reviews, check out some of the other basketball hoop review sites to read more.</p>

<h5 id="we-absolutely-love-our-new-pro-dunk-hoop">We absolutely love our new Pro Dunk Hoop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We absolutely love our new Pro Dunk Hoop. My husband has wanted a basketball hoop in our backyard for a long time but didn&rsquo;t want to get one that would wear quickly and need to be replaced. This is a strong, quality hoop. It was pretty easy to assemble just need some strong muscles as the pieces are pretty heavy. We made a mistake on our end when installing and Pro Dunk was so helpful and quick to help us figure out a solution. We will definitely recommend Pro Dunk hoops to anyone looking to buy a hoop. It&rsquo;s already been put to great use and I&rsquo;m excited to watch my kids get better at basketball as they play with this hoop. My kids absolutely love how easy it is to lower to their level and it&rsquo;s so nice how low it goes. My husband was the main one wanting the hoop but my 9, 6 &amp; 4 year old kiddos are using it daily. Thanks so much for a great purchase!</p>

<h5 id="very-good-but-falls-short-in-a-few-spots">Very good, but falls short in a few spots.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just installed the hoop. The install was easy. The hoop is very well constructed in comparison to goal rolls and other big box brands. I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have watched the you tube on mega slam&hellip;better hoop for around a hundred dollars. The pro dunk falls short in a couple places. First is the height measure. It&rsquo;s a hanging piec of metal&hellip;not super accurate and you have to bring it out to lower the hoop vs something that&rsquo;s attached. Hot dip galvanization makes this hoop pricey in comparison. The rim mounts are flawed. The rubber coated mounts are clearly not as good as the full rubber mount. Also in my case they made the rim off level requiring a trip to the Home Depot to get some shims.It&rsquo;s overall a super nice hoop. The play off the backboard and thickness of parts are superior to lots of hoops. But for the price point it&rsquo;s not the best.</p>

<h5 id="easy-install-the-kit-came-with-everything-except-concrete">Easy Install. The kit came with everything except concrete</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy Install. The kit came with everything except concrete. Including the rebar- I never expected it to be packaged in steps great Job. When installing the base plate you can fudge a little being parallel to the court because the base plate is slotted and can move a little- not just a hole. This made it very easy to adjust the backboard. My son is 12 and loves the feel of the return of the ball off the glass backboard. It was definitely a change from a cheaper plastic backboard. I hope it will help in the school&rsquo;s court.</p>

<h5 id="has-abused-this-system-and-it-s-held-up-wonderfully-this-pro-dunk-gold-hoop-has-exceeded-my">has abused this system and it&rsquo;s held up wonderfully. This Pro Dunk Gold hoop has exceeded my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had our hoop installed since July 2016. Our family, cousins, etc. has abused this system and it&rsquo;s held up wonderfully. This Pro Dunk Gold hoop has exceeded my expectations. Installation was easier than I thought it was going to be when I looked at the pallet of boxes on my driveway. I had a concrete contractor pour the court and place the anchor bolts. After the cure was done I had two friends come help with me with the installation. We were done in 45 minutes and playing ball!I&rsquo;ve had to contact Pro Dunk about a topic that was 100% my fault. They mailed me a replacement part free of charge. When I received the replacement part I realized I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;break&rdquo; the original part and offered to pay them for it. They declined my payment offer and appreciated my honesty with them.The product is awesome and their customer support is top notch. I highly recommend this product and the Pro Dunk company.</p>

<h5 id="best-hoop-on-the-market">Best Hoop on the market!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This hoop is everything you&rsquo;re looking for. The best quality and easy to adjust. Our kids are loving it. We could not be more pleased! It is easy for a 9 y/o or older to adjust. Looks great on the driveway!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-hoop-easy-to-use-only-1-problem">Great hoop, easy to use, only 1 problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great hoop, neighbors comment about it all the time and really stands out. I would buy it all over again. Only problem is I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a month now and ever since I set it up when someone dunks or a ball hits rim real hard it shakes the whole unit. I double checked every bolt and they are all tight but it shakes. Kind of frustrating because of how expensive it is. This is where you could improve your hoop. Love the rim, BACKBOARD and pole though!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-quality">Amazing quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be more satisfied. This is exactly what I heard it would be. Sturdy professional quality goal that you couldn&rsquo;t get in any retail locations. The installer recommended by the website in our area was outstanding as well. I know I will refer in the future&hellip;great product!</p>
