<h5 id="for-me-the-cinema-is-not-a-slice-of-life-but-a-piece-of-cake-alfred-hitchcock">&ldquo;For me, the cinema is not a slice of life, but a piece of cake.&rdquo;&ndash;Alfred Hitchcock</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well now you can eat your cake at home. We bought this Epson Powerlite at Best Buy (which, amazingly, at the time was cheaper than on Amazon) and have been playing with it for a while now. Below are some tips and considerations and things I personally wish we had known before we bought the 2045.WIRELESS FEATURES: I&rsquo;m going to start with this, because BEWARE. The features for streaming are pretty limited. The iProjection app is described as &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo;. It is, in fact, nightmarish. I couldn&rsquo;t get it to work; it requires more advanced wireless connection knowledge than your average person has. The average star rating for the app hovers just above one star, and I highly encourage anyone who wants a projector with wireless features to read the reviews. Most people can only stream pictures and many programs business people use are not supported. So watch out.GENERAL SET-UP: The projector comes with a quick-start guide, which will get you up and running within honestly a few minutes for the basics. The problem comes with setting up some of the more advanced features; for that you will need the full guide. Epson doesn&rsquo;t include it with the projector. Instead you get a link so you can download and print, on your own dime, all 207 pages of it. This is inexcusable for a product in this price range. The full manual is not the best-written guide anyway&ndash;it sometimes assumes you will just know how to do things that some people do not know (like the wireless set up.) I know many of you shoppers out there do have more advanced technical knowledge, which is why you like projectors in the first place, but a good manual should not assume that for a home-use product. The poor wireless features and missing full manual out of box lose this product a total of one full star. Which is a shame, because here comes the spectacular stuff.PERFORMANCE/PICTURE QUALITY: Just gorgeous. We got this projector when we did to stream the Superbowl in HD, and we were not disappointed. It pretty much looked like we were sitting on the sidelines gazing at the actual players. The image is so sharp, the colors so beautiful. You can toy with aspect rations and colors and tweak this and that if you wish, but right out of the box we were so pleased. The remote lets you flip between sources quickly (see photo for an up-close look). Lamp life is 4000 hours, 6000 on eco mode. Replacement lamps as of this writing will cost you $80 if you buy them directly from Epson.SOUND/ BUILT-IN SPEAKERS: As you can imagine, the built-in speakers are just okay. Still, if you need to transport the unit (like for a business meeting), the sound is good enough for a small room. Outdoors, you may be in trouble. What I&rsquo;m most impressed about is that we were able to run our 25-year-old Bose sound system through this Epson. The last projector we had, a Viewsonic, couldn&rsquo;t do that. So the built-in system is so-so, but setting up your own speaker system is easy. That leads us to&hellip;ROOM SET-UP; This is not a short-throw projector&ndash;you will need at least 8 feet from the wall or free-standing screen if you have the projector sitting on a table (you can mount it on the ceiling of course, but be advised you will have to disconnect it to change the lamps. Not fun.). We found our ideal spot at about 11 feet from the large wall we use to project on. We have a big loose carpet we can run wires under; if you don&rsquo;t have that beware of tripping hazards. Our last projector, the Viewsonic, was a short-throw, which I did like because it works in more spaces. This is a far superior picture quality though and we currently have the space, but keep in mind the distance you will need.A NOTE TO GAMERS: Another reviewer reported a &ldquo;lag&rdquo; time when using game systems with this projector. We noticed it too. We use our XBOX 360 as a DVD player, and there is a definite lag, meaning the image runs at times a bit behind the sound, then blurs and catches up. If this is a deal-breaker to you but you are still interested in this projector I would buy the unit from a place that will let you return it if you run into the lag problem using your preferred gaming system.WARRANTY: On this expensive of a product, you might want to consider an extended warranty. We bought one good for two years from Best Buy; it was cheaper than Epson&rsquo;s extended warranty plus you can take the projector into any local Best Buy and they will fix any problem the projector has (unless you drop it in a vat of acid or something. Then you&rsquo;re on your own.). Depending on the current Amazon price (which is $100 less than when we bought our unit), it may or may not be worth it to you to buy it elsewhere and get a warranty.In conclusion, highly recommended for a home cinema use. We&rsquo;re big movie people, especially classic films, and we just love this projector. As detailed above, there might be serious drawbacks for some people. While I don&rsquo;t have enough technical knowledge to answer more complicated questions about the product, set-up and basic use were well-within my abilities and the product doesn&rsquo;t cause me headaches. We run it 8 hours a day 7 days a week and we give it:GRADE: B+</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome projector. Easy to set up, the image is sharp, the colors are beautiful, and the blacks are plenty dark.My only complaint is that the fan is quite loud, even in ECO mode. You eventually learn to tune it out, but even with surround sound, I can hear it in quiet moments in movies or TV and it&rsquo;s quite distracting. Never the less the image is still incredible, definitely a great projector.</p>

<h5 id="it-worked-great-then-after-watching-it-for-long-hours-it-seems">It worked great then after watching it for long hours it seems &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the refurbished projector. It worked great then after watching it for long hours it seems it switches to 3D and I could not get it to go away unless I turned it off and let it cool. I&rsquo;ve returned it and getting it exchanged with the same model. I&rsquo;ll report back how the replacement works. Otherwise it has a great picture, works well in ambient light.It also had ghosting.Ok so I got the replacement projector and it was still ghosting. The projector was about 1 foot under the screen. I then raised the projector by putting it on a stand so now its about 2 feet above the bottom of the screen 15&rsquo; back and there is no more ghosting around the edges. It works great now. So I would not recommend putting this on the floor to project up. You will get some weird lighting issues around the picture. For 549.00 this projector is a steal. Get it! Then wait for the 4K projectors to go down in price over the next few years.</p>

<p>Great projector, would recommend it! Great picture quality and easy to setup.</p>

<h5 id="the-picture-is-great-and-very-easy-to-set-up">the picture is great and very easy to set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly, I would definitely say you need some speakers with it, but it does not have to be anything crazy. It works really well with ambient light and well with lots of light. The only time it does not blow me away from it when it is very bright and it is a dark scene but that it was I expected. the picture is great and very easy to set up. I did lots of researched and was worried the distance from the screen or the level of the screen would not work but it works perfectly. I could not be happier with the projector. Also, I use it with my Xbox one and it works great.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-perfect-projector-for-my-uses">This is a perfect projector for my uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a perfect projector for my uses!I love it, it does everything I need. I have some videos on USB storage and this would not play through the USB port so I run them thru my Smart 3D Blu Ray player then HDMI to this HC 2045, it even controls my Blu Ray with the Epson remote.</p>

<h5 id="3d-awesomeness">3D AWESOMENESS!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing clarity, quality, and easy set-up! We will never leave the house to see a movie again! 3D quality is awesome!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We installed this in our basement home theater setup. It&rsquo;s not the brightest projector out there, but really can&rsquo;t be beat for the price! The picture is sharp and the colors are vibrant. Paired with a good projector screen, this is a great value.</p>
