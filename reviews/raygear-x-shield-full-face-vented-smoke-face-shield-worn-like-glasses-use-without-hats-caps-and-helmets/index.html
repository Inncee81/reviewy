<h5 id="walking-into-bitter-cold-wind-is-why-i-bought-it-at-32-f-is-fine-at-16-f-shield-gets-too-foggy-see-workaround">Walking into bitter cold wind is why I bought it. At 32° F is fine. At 16° F, shield gets too foggy. See workaround.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got it today and walked a few miles in 32° F with winds at 15 mph. Completely took the bite out of what would have been an unpleasant walk.Tried it with glasses and was not a problem, but you wind up looking through a lower part of the glasses lenses.Shield did not fog up at all, though there was some condensation on the lower half at the end of the walk.Wore it with a scarf and knit hat.Wind did not break through the vents.My nose was cold at the end of the walk, but no where as cold as it would have been without the X-Shield. Ordinarily I would have my nose covered with a scarf, but chose not to while wearing the shield.I was able to hear myself inhaling and exhaling throughout the walk more than usual, as the sound is directed towards my ears with the shield.Update: Weeks after my original test I went out in 16° F weather with wind of 17 mph and the results were not as good. Glasses really fogged up under the shield. I was just not getting enough air passing through to take away the moisture. Though it is likely I would have had issues with my glasses at that temperature anyway. Condensation blocked much of the mask, visually. Was bearable walking on sidewalks that I knew, but my vision was too blocked by the condensation on the shield to make it safe to walk in an area I didn&rsquo;t know. I had to look out the side of one side that was clear, which is not a perfect solution. On the plus side, my face was no colder than the first time, which would have been great except for glasses and shield being covered with condensation from breathing.Update 2: By fashioning a nose apron out of a cut cereal bag (bag in a cereal box) I was able to direct all of my breathing downward and out of the shield. This worked in 11° F with 20 mph. wind, resulting in a fog-free shield.</p>

<h5 id="a-truly-perfect-product">A Truly Perfect Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is comfortable with or without wearing glasses. Does not distort prescription lens if you do wear glasses and if you are wearing sun glasses it seems to cut glare just a little, but in no way did I find it increases glare.The comfort is something I can&rsquo;t get over. They stay in place very well - and in addition the vendor supplies an elastic type of narrow sport strap to hold the face shield in place just a little bit better. But really &hellip; this product weighs very little and stays in place quite comfortably, so I doubt that I&rsquo;ll need it. It&rsquo;s a good little addition to an already fantastic product..I&rsquo;ve worn different types of face shields and welding helmets and spray equipment protective hoods for just over 40 years. Where has this design been all of my working life (I&rsquo;m retiring in 14 months.)Even the cloth pouch that comes with this product is good quality. I write very few reviews especially considering how much I purchase on Amazon. This product is so good that all I can say is buy one of these face shields and see if you don&rsquo;t feel the same way. Perfect design. Quality materials. Excellent attention to detail in trimming the edges and vent lines infront of the mouth area &hellip; the whole shebang - it is just right.</p>

<h5 id="surprise-even-better-than-you-can-imagine">Surprise! Even better than you can imagine.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always used safety glasses and safety shields, and they are not optional in my shop. But I didn&rsquo;t really consider this until I saw Adam Savage (of MythBusters) give it a thumbs up. I must say I have been pleasantly surprised! They are MUCH more comfortable, helpful, less intrusive and better all around than any other safety shield or glasses than I have ever encountered. My kids don&rsquo;t object and they put them on without any reminder from me. Should be standard equipment in every workshop.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-face-shield-at-a-reasonable-price">Quality face shield at a reasonable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to purchase these face shields for use in my tanning salon. After searching the internet for quite some time, i was thrilled to find them at a decent price on amazon. I received them timely and securely packaged in protective cloth bags within the box. The shield is sturdy and, unlike other protective masks/hats in tanning, doesn&rsquo;t look cheap at all. The ones I ordered have a nice smoky tint and functions nicely as full face protection. The only disadvantage I can find to this product is the weight. In exchange for being sturdy the mask weighs quite a bit, creating pressure down the nose. Other than that, the product is solid and well worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-and-comfortable">Well made and comfortable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice and light weight. Pretty comfortable to use for long periods. I enjoy the vents though the unvented isn&rsquo;t bad. Love that it has UV protective coating.</p>

<p>First off it looks and feels awesome. Plus you can&rsquo;t beat the protection, I use it mainly for cutting ply or plastic</p>

<h5 id="nice-for-the-price">Nice, for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice, for the price.Works pretty well for over-the-glasses face protection.Too heavy for long term use, and the venting doesn&rsquo;t really help with fogging issues.</p>

<p>This one falls into the &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I think of that&rdquo; category. It&rsquo;s lightweight, easy to use, and offers exceptional visibility - that in turn makes it more likely to be&hellip;</p>

<p>Excellent product. Great Construction. Fits nicely on your face without the bulk of a typical face shield. The arms are sturdy and don&rsquo;t flex in ways you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
