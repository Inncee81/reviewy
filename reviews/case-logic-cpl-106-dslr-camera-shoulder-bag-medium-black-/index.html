<h5 id="a-much-better-option-imo-than-the-bag-that-came-with-my-camera">A much better option IMO than the bag that came with my camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE 6-13-2013My camera bag was recently stolen, sigh, but I replaced it with an identical one (this item), but in the process of replacing gear I got a Nikon 70-300mm lens instead of a 55-300mm lens. The 70-300mm lens is slightly longer than the 55-300 version, and doesn&rsquo;t fit well in this bag. The zipper is hard to close while the long lens is attached to the camera body. Sigh. So be advised that if you have anything mounted to your camera that is longer than a Nikon D5100 w/ a 55-300mm lens, it won&rsquo;t easily fit in this bag. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&hellip;it&rsquo;s a perfect fit for the slightly shorter lens, but nothing longer.ORIGINAL REVIEWLast summer my wife gave me a Nikon D5100 with 18-55mm and 55-300mm lenses. The set came with a Nikon stock shoulder bag Nikon Deluxe Digital SLR Camera Case - Gadget Bag.After using the Nikon bag for a few months I noticed some shortcomings:1) The metal front clips pinched my fingers, hard!, more than once.2) The top would not easily close when the long lens was attached to the camera body - the bag was too short for that.3) When the top inner zipper pouch contained cords, an extra battery, etc., the sides of the top puckered up and out, and did not provide much protection from the weather, etc.I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to use that bag forever and I had my eyes open for an alternative, so I jumped at the chance to try out this bag from Case Logic.I was a bit skeptical when I pulled it out of the box. It has lighter weight construction from the top handle all the way to the bottom of the bag than my Nikon bag. It also looked too small to accommodate my basic camera set up (camera body, two lenses, charger, cables, extra battery and SD card, etc.).I was pleasantly surprised when I adjusted the velcro inner dividers a little and started putting things away. The bag is tall enough so that the camera body fits nicely with either the short or long lens attached. The other lens and charger fit snugly in the other half of the main compartment. The front zipper pouch is large enough to easily hold the camera cords. The underside of the top flap has two small elastic pouches. These work great for my 2nd battery and extra SD card. There is a Velcro flap that holds them in place. In addition, there is a fairly small zipper pouch there. It&rsquo;s big enough to accommodate cords or another small item. This is where I keep my lens paper. There are also small elastic web pouches on the outer sides of the bag. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll end up using those for. Lastly, and this is REALLY COOL, there what at first appears to be an upside down Velcro pouch on the back of the bag. The opening faces down, eh!? When you explore that pouch a little more, you will find that it contains a rain fly for the bag! It&rsquo;s attached to the bag so you won&rsquo;t lose it. Just pull it up over the top of the bag, and down over the front so that the elastic on it holds it in place. Nifty!The rain fly is actually attached via Velcro as well so you can remove it if you want to, but I don&rsquo;t know why you would.The one thing I didn&rsquo;t understand about this bag at first was the orientation of the zipper around the top flap. Instead of zipping from one side of the bag, around the front, and then back to the other side, it zips from one side, around the back side of the bag. After I used the bag a few times a light went on in my tiny little brain&hellip;it was when I had the bag&rsquo;s strap over a shoulder. This zipper arrangement allowed me to unzip the pouch, open the top, and look in the main compartment without having to look over a flap. Neat. And if I didn&rsquo;t zip the flap right away, it flopped over, partially covering the compartment and shielding contents from the sun and the casual passer-by.Lastly, I like the weight and style of the bag. I used it at a sporting event today, and when I had my camera and long lens out, I could barely feel the bag over my shoulder. As for the style of the bag, I like that it does not scream &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an expensive camera in here.&rdquo; I mean, it&rsquo;s not much larger than a lunchbox or a bag someone might use on a trip to the beach to carry a 6-pack of sodas or something. That was something that kind of bugged me about my old bag&hellip;it had this gold colored metal plaque on the front that boldly stated &ldquo;NIKON&rdquo;. Some people might like that, but not me. It&rsquo;s like someone who owns a Ferrari and has a Ferrari emblem on their key chain. I mean, how likely is it that they are going to forget that they drive a Ferrari? They&rsquo;re just showing off. I&rsquo;m not into that.All in all, the more I use this bag, the more I like it. I like it so much that I gave my Nikon bag to a friend who needed a camera bag.5 stars for a lightweight shoulder camera bag. It&rsquo;s a keeper!</p>

<h5 id="versatile-roomy-and-quality-camera-bag">Versatile, Roomy, and Quality Camera Bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a larger bag for my Canon SX530 HS, as my Lowepro Rezo 120 was too small to fit the manual along with my two mini tripods and neck strap. This bag is fantastic, with 3 Velcro dividers inside (2 large and one small), a large mesh pocket under the front zipper, a long pocket on the inside of the top flap that can be used for cleaning cloths and battery chargers, a small double pocket on inside of top flap for memory cards, and 2 side very expandable mesh pockets. This bag is large, but that is what I like about it, as it can house my Canon SX530, my smaller Canon SX700, and my Fujifilm Instamatic camera along with its film. Love the touches like the metal zipper pull that tucks into the inside top flap pocket to prevent any scratching to your equipment, the padded shoulder strap, and the discreet rain hood tucked into a pocket on the bag. I usually buy Lowepro camera bags, but this Case Logic bag is perfectly configured for my needs and I will be keeping it. My only concern is the durability of the top handle over time as it appears to not be as sturdily stitched as a Lowepro bag. Overall, this is a very good value and I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-perfect-size">This is the perfect size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Cannon Rebel T5i with the 18-135 and 18-55 lenses. The bag fits the camera with the 18-135 w shade in the center the 18-55 on one side with a Vello wireless remote. The adjustable divider works perfect to protect them both on all sides. on the other side I have a Cannon 430 EX Flash with a Soften Omni bounce attachment on it. Again the adjustable divider protects it on all sides. the front pocket has my charger and a polarizer for my 18-135. The lid hay my extra sticks and cleaning cloth and air brush. The strap adjusts to my shoulder and wast perfectly and it is very comfortable to carry. The outside end pockets carry standard size water bottles with ease making this bag my best friend on a long photo shoot. I am very impressed and would recommend it to all causal photographers that are not ready to haul a back pack. I also purchased the Case Logic SLRC-206 back pack for when i need to carry my laptop on the plane. It looks equally impressive but I have not loaded it yet so that review will have to wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="finally">Finally</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have finally found the bag that I have been looking for. I can fit in my A6500, 18-105mm, 28mm,50mm and 60mm lens if I choose to do so. And this all fits in a small bag. I really hate the big flap of some other camera bags. It just gets in my way. I gave this bag 5 stars because it took me so long to find it. The only bad thing I can see is the plastic parts. I replace the strap with another that I had.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-bag-for-me">Good Bag for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this because of its low key appearance and with the hopes that it would fit my Nikon 3300 with the 300mm zoom attached. It came through on both accounts. I took it on a plane as carry on and carried it daily in Central America taking thousands of pictures. I had to use the rain hood (had to find it first) and it is adequate and protected my gear in the tropical rain but could be better. Camera with 300mm barely fits retraced all the way lens facing down. I also had with me one smaller lens, a hood, spare battery, charger, and cables in the bag. There are compartments for sd cards, and cables or whatever you like to carry. Its small but that&rsquo;s what I wanted for this trip.I don&rsquo;t like the strap it squeaks when I walk and isn&rsquo;t terribly comfortable but it clips on so it can be changed if you need to carry this all day as I did.</p>
