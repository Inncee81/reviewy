<h5 id="this-one-for-you-if-you-re-looking-for-a-budget-drone">This one for you if you&rsquo;re looking for a budget drone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m shocked that this drone have decent camera quality and it has a microphone too! But mostly you will hear the blades running&hellip;This drone is the best purchase I ever made!!!( I Did not received this for free! I purchased this with my money!!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-drone">Great drone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a father&rsquo;s day gift for my husband along with the protection plan. He loves it! It&rsquo;s got two batteries and he gets anywhere from 5-10 minutes per battery depending if he uses the camera or not. The camera itself has great quality both for pictures and video. I don&rsquo;t know exact measurements but this drone goes very high up and far down our street without losing signal. We are both new to drones and it was easy to learn how to use. My husbands impressed with the ability to flip and throw it into the air and immediately fly it from there. I would definitely buy this again as a gift.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-price-i-would-say-it-was-a-good-first-choice">&hellip; for the price I would say it was a good first choice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first drone and for the price I would say it was a good first choice. It is easy to fly and control outside in light wind conditions. (I don&rsquo;t fly it inside). In windy conditions it does tend to go with the wind but if you keep it down out of the wind it is easy to control. The batteries are good for about 7 minutes without the camera on so buy some extra (and charger) if you want to have it last longer. The video and pictures are better quality than I suspected they would be. The only problem with the video is the engine noise so if you plan on using the video turn the audio down and you will have a good quality video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-and-fun">Easy to use and fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use and fun! I bought one for my husband for Father&rsquo;s Day and didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot since I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;d like one. Well, he loves it!
