<h5 id="one-of-the-top-best-directional-antennas">One of the Top Best Directional Antennas</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this antenna recently to add to my many antennas I have tested and installed on my RV. I use my RV every year to travel all over western U.S. for 6 months. In many areas there are no cell signals. But with my directional antennas I can rotate it until I find a cell signal from a distance cell tower. On example is I camp in Canyonlands of Utah. It is 70 miles into the wilderness and 40 miles into the area. You can not get a cell signal with a cell phone. But once there I can turn my directional antenna and receive 3 to 4 bar, giving me cell service and 3G for internet. I am the only one there with cell service.I have tested many omni and directional antennas for 20 years and I can tell you there are only few directional antennas that really work well. My top directional antennas before this purchase is Yogi. I installed this new Wider Band directional Antenna and get more bars than the Yogi. I am due to leave for out west in another 4 weeks and I will report how much better it is in the wilderness.If you are in a remote area I recommend this directional antenna with a Wilson booster. There are number of Wilson boosters and I have tried most of them. The new cradle type works the best. It is compact and operate on less wattage but will give you more bars. There are two recent makes, dual band and tri Band. Dual band tested good for all cell providers, but technically Tri Band will cover T-Mobile and AT&amp;T better. The newer model is 815326 with small antenna or 815325 with cradel only. I prefer buying my own larger antenna for much better reception. Need an adpator for the cradel end to connect to regular cell cable. (FME male to SMA male plug Straight Connector Adapter) You might need few cable adapters to hook it up but not difficult to figure out and order on Amazon. Greatest thing with the cradle type is I can attach a mini antenna and a small power supply and carry it in my backpack in the wilderness and still be connected. My family use it also to travel to South America where signal is weak and still use the phone. Cradle type is for use by one person at a time. There are number of whole house boosters that works will for about $400. But the signal strength will vary by how far you are from internal antenna. By mounting the directional antenna on the roof, you will get excellent result.Take my word for it, with proper mounting and a booster this antenna is well worth the price. With any equipment you have to use it for the right purpose. Without a good booster, antenna is workthless. Uness you have an old dirrect connect phones. I would pay 4 times what it is sold for because of the performance it gives me. Remember it is directional antenna so it will perform poorly if you point it away from the tower. A regular straight omni directional antenna will perform better in cases where the tower is nearby. I have found if you are in the cities, a small boad-band data antenna will out perform a directional antenna in the house.I will update when I run tests in the wilderness where the tower is very far away and compare it to my best antennas.If you want to connect this antenna to a regular cellphone cable you need this adapter. WILSON ELECTRONICS 971119 Fme Male to Sma Male Connector. It is sold on Amazon also.Feel free to ask me questions if I can help. I know how difficault it is to have signal in remote areas. I have found even different phones will make a difference in cell receptions. I will generaly get 2 more bars in remote areas on my iPhone. I&rsquo;ve been testing antennas for very long time because in the old days there were much less towers on the road and in the wilderness so I had to use many ways to improve reception. I have always use Verizon due to coverage. But this year I have both Verizon and T-mobile phones to test and compare in the wilderness&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-option-for-rural-areas">Great option for rural areas</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My parents live in an internet dead zone: too far away for DSL, no cable on the street, and weak cell signal (half a bar if you stand in the right spot). So, I did some research and we purchased a set of Wilson Electronics products, followed the installation guides online, and in no time they had 4 bars of 4G data in the house and with a Verizon mobile router, they now have high speed internet. (Seriously, 2014 and they were still struggling with a $10/mo dial up program). I&rsquo;m very excited with how well this worked out.I used an app to locate the cell tower and dial the antenna in.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-in-marginal-areas">Works Great in Marginal Areas</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the WIlson Dual Band Mobile Wireless Booster with the Magnetic Mount Omni Directional and Velcro patch indoor antenna that goes with it. It was good for freeway use but the gain was a bit on the low side so it is better if you put your phone next to the patch. For this reason, I prefer the phone cradle. This wide band directional antenna is a good addition when we are parked in campgrounds and jobsites with marginal coverage. The signal was so bad in Hunting Island State Park that even with the stock booster antenna, the phone needs to be attached to the patch antenna with a rubber band to get even a consistent 1 bar signal. Even with the improved signal, I was still dropping calls. I mounted this directional antenna to the RV awning and then raised it to roof level. I parked my RV along the same orientation as the nearest cell tower and my signal improved from -118 to -75 (4bars consistent, 5 bars sporadic.), About 4 feet away from the patch antenna, I still have 3 bars so I don&rsquo;t need to be tethered to the antenna for make calls anymore. No dropped calls and I even 4G internet on AT&amp;T. RV owners can probably mount this on the TV antenna rotator and get even better performance. It definitely works!</p>

<h5 id="great-reception-if-aimed-like-a-rifle-and-you-have-a-clear-path-to-the-tower-no-mountains">Great Reception If Aimed Like a Rifle And You Have a Clear Path To The Tower ( No Mountains)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: After some experimentation, I have determined the RV/TRucker Antenna gives me more reliable reception, as I am in a very remote mountainous area, drawing multiple signals from multiple towers and providers. If you have a tower within several miles and nice clear and direct line of site without mountains, the YAGI will perform well. ALSO Wilson now offers a higher gain and Larger Velcro Antenna that connects to the back of the phone, producing much better reception that the original compact velcro antenna.Early on in my learning process I replaced the Wilson RV/Trucker Spring Mount Antenna with 14 foot FME Female connector, originally connected to the Wilson Direct Connect Booster, using the 15 foot extension cable and compact velcro attached phone antenna. I then ordered the #304411 Yagi and 30 foot N cable. Also the adapter N Female to FME Female #971107, as the 30 foot N Cable comes with two male ends. The Yagi Antenna comes with an N female connector, which connects to one end of the male N on the 30 foot cable. From there I connected the other Male N of the cable to the Female N connector to the Adaptor #971107. From there&hellip;I connected the FME Extension Cable coming from the inside Booster, which has an FME cable with male end coming out from the Booster. The nomeclature on the connectors can be confusing, so make sure you understand they seem to be reversed upon looking at images. The N cable is very large diameter, stiff and heavy with low loss on long runs outside. The FME cable is very small diameter, light and easy to run inside of tight places in my case, an RV. My reception was much better then&hellip;AT TIMES.. than using the the RV/Trucker antenna. The #304411 must be aimed toward the nearest cell tower for best signal. I mounted my unit on a very tall pine tree, but there is 2 inch diameter mounting hardeware included with the Yagi as well as 2 inch poles and arms avalable for other mounting options. I now have 2 full bars of 3G Verizon signal, compared to barley any or no signal at all in my remote area without boosting provisions. The higher the antenna is mounted the better reception.</p>
