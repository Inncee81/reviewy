<h5 id="the-mighty-little-box">The mighty little box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon opening the box, the unit was much smaller than I thought it would be, but it packs a lot of goodness in a tiny shell. It was easy to hook up. Pairing took a minute to work out. You have to make sure your phones bluetooth is off and not already paired with your headset. HahaThe sound is good, I&rsquo;d recommend a nice pair of over the ear headphones for deeper tones. There is almost no latency in audio. No crackle in signal at all while walking around the house watching TV while the kids nap on the couch. 30 feet away and the signal is still strong and clear. I&rsquo;m planning on buying a 2nd unit to add more headphones.I highly recommend this product if you want to be able to watch tv, play games or listen to music without disturbing the family.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-easiest-bt-tx-rx-device-i-ve-used-to-date-a-great-improvement-over-the-last-device-i-tried">This is the easiest BT TX/RX device I&rsquo;ve used to date - a great improvement over the last device I tried.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received a free replacement to evaluate and was pleasantly surprised. This one paired almost instantly and re-paired immediately after recharging. The previous version I owned of this required you to get up and go thru an extensive repairing every time which was annoying since I sleep with the headphones on to cut out ambient noise (snoring, the occasional dog barking and early morning garbage trucks on weekends). Now all I have to do is pair the Bose QC35 the first time, turn off the BT switch while charging, then after they are completely recharged, I just turn them back on and they re-pair automatically. This is a real joy for someone who uses the transmitter always plugged in and the headphones on a constant basis while sleeping. I&rsquo;m tremendously impressed that a company would take the initiative to send out a free replacement for a returned defective device and follow up with me to see that it actually performed up to my standards. This unit is truly effortless and is everything you would expect - it&rsquo;s the answer to the Sony UHD &ldquo;We forgot to include BT technology with your expensive TV&hellip;&rdquo; and after a while you realize it&rsquo;s probably even better than built in devices as it requires no remote control or switching from the program you&rsquo;re watching to the menu, to sound, to speakers, to BT, etc, etc. What a relief! It&rsquo;s literally automatic after you set it up the first time.</p>

<h5 id="works-perfectly-with-bose-qc35">Works perfectly with Bose QC35</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have connected the device to a TV and I am transmitting to a Bose QC35. After 1 week of use, it is still working perfectly well. No noticeable voice latency, clear sound, and the Bose QC35 automatically pairs whenever it is switched on. What more can you want?</p>

<h5 id="really-like-this-one-minor-annoyance">Really like this&hellip;one minor annoyance.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a BT transmitter from a big box electronic chain and was disappointed in it, so I returned it and scoured Amazon for a replacement. I found and ordered this one and am very happy so far. In fact, I just ordered another today. I agree with another review that the unit, packaging and instructions are top-notch.I primarily use it to transmit TV to my wireless Sony over-the-ear headphones at night so my wife can sleep while I watch TV. From across the room (15&rsquo;) sound quality is great.I haven&rsquo;t tried pairing 2 headphones yet, so can&rsquo;t say how that works. I have walked around my house with the headphones on and the reception is pretty good, just a few interruptions here and there, but I didn&rsquo;t drop the connection. I&rsquo;ve even walked outside and managed to keep the connection, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it reliable. When I walked too far away, I lost the connection, but when I walked in the house (on the opposite side of the house from the bedroom) the device reconnected and restored the sound. Cool!I keep the unit plugged in to a USB adapter so that it&rsquo;s always charged and turned on. Here&rsquo;s the only annoying &ldquo;feature&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s apparently common to all BT transmitters: when I turn the paired headphones off, the transmitter flashes the blue LED every second - constantly and never stops unless you turn the transmitter off. Depending on how/where your transmitter is located, in the pitch dark the flashing blue light can be sooooooo annoying. After the first night, I taped a piece of dark paper over it. It&rsquo;s not pretty, but the problem is solved.</p>

<h5 id="tt-ba08-and-tt-ba07">TT-BA08 and TT-BA07</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to use wireless earbuds at work with Sirius Radio. Using wired headphones or earbuds kept tangling with my workplace. So, I decided to try the TT-BA07 with some Skullcandy wireless earbuds. Once paired, I really liked the transmitter. It clearly covered our 500&rsquo; workplace. No interference. And no tangled cords! So, I decided I wanted to try wireless headphones at home with our tv. I took the transmitter home and tried to pair it with the same earbuds. It wouldn&rsquo;t pair. After much effort I took them back to the workplace and thought they would easily pair again. No. After much effort ( some calls to earbud support) I finally paired them.I decided to get another Taotronics transmitter. I was going to get the same one but noticed the newer model TT-BA08. After asking the Amazon community I got the newer model. Here is the bottom line. They both work great. They both have the ability to act as a transmitter or receiver. The newer model has better functionality with volume control in the receiver mode. But the battery with the BA07 is around 7 hours while the BA08 has around twenty hours.I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet but I believe both transmitters can be plugged into the USB port on the tv and it will keep it constantly powered. You can plug and charge these transmitters while you are using them. I do admit I am not completely convinced doing this will not overcharge or reduce the life of the internal battery. All being said I would recommend these transmitters to anyone. They are really nice.I&rsquo;m going to go a little further here. If you prefer to use a Walkman or other fm radio with a transmitter that uses radio frequencies, try one made by Scosche. It is designed I believe in Oxnard CA but manufactured in China. It runs on two aaa batteries. A really great little transmitter. I have all of these and love them all.</p>
