</ul>

<p>Keeping your phone safe and secure when driving just got a whole lot better with the TaoTronics TT-SH017 Car Phone Mount. Redesigned with phone safety and driver convenience in mind, the new design features a one-button rear release that unlocks the holder arms. The new button position also makes it more convenient to grab the phone so it doesn’t accidentally slip away as the arms unlock.</p>

<p>Flat Suction Cup Sticks Better
When it comes to suction cups, only one sticks down best – a flat one. By flattening the surface area, a flat suction cup can create a tighter grip as less air is allowed to be caught underneath. Not only that, but the suction cup covers a larger surface area allowing it to grip on tighter to dashboards or windows.</p>

<p>Adjust, Rotate, or Swivel
No matter if you lean back into your seat or hunch over the wheel, the TaoTronics Car Phone Cradle can be adjusted to get the position that’s right for you. For your benefit are three different ways to get the perfect angle – adjustable arm length, 180° arm rotation, and a 360° joint ball. Together you’ll be able to enjoy hands free phone calls or access maps with ease.</p>

<p>Made for Improved Usability
Part of what makes a great product is how the design helps the user, and with the TaoTronics Car Phone Stand, the design is based on usability. That means the small things like the adjustable support tray, the rubber holder arms that offer a firmer hold, or the improved knobs to make adjustment easier, are designed for user-friendliness and convenience.</p>

<p>Fits Most Popular Smartphones
Still use the classic iPhone 4S? Worry that your iPhone 7 Plus might be too big? Thanks to the adjustable holder arms with a 2 in / 5.2 cm - 3.62 in / 9.2 cm range, the phone holder can fit just about every popular smartphone – yep, even all the iPhone Plus models.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="i-love-this-french-fry-holder">I love this French fry holder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this French fry holder! It holds it in place perfectly without falling and even fits the Xtra large size. The arm articulates at the perfect angle for your fingers to grab the fries. I will definitely recommend this product.On a side note: it works pretty well for my Google Pixel too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had it for two months now, used on two different cars, both with curved dash, not smooth surface. Performs as described. Has not come off at all, but did have some problem trying to adjust; just be careful when adjusting not to drop any of the fasteners that hold it in together. With the extension arm, you can get it close to where you want to use it. Others I have had mounted so far away they were worthless (Costco). Also will adjust so it is below the windshield so there is no loss of line of sight at all. Excellent product and pretty good price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="holds-phone-steady-but-it">Holds phone steady but it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as stated. I have used others that didn&rsquo;t work. This one works and stays in placeUpdate bought a second one for my other car. It&rsquo;s awesome</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for my Samsung s7 in my Kia Sorento. Works very well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-definitely-recommend-to-others-that-needs-to-be-hands-free-while">Would definitely recommend to others that needs to be hands free while &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was surprised that it was able to fit my phone with the case. For reference, I have an iPhone 7 Plus. In addition, it has many points on it so you can get the desired position you want. Would definitely recommend to others that needs to be hands free while driving when using navigation from your phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great Customer Service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one I received had a defective hinge on one of the adjustable parts. I contacted the seller and they quickly replaced the defective one. The adhesive is strong and sticks to most surfaces in my car.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing">Disappointing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No longer holds position after 1.5 months of use, poor quality</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-right-away">Broke right away</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke after only a couple of days of use. The clamps holding the phone are very weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">Don&rsquo;t buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke with in 2 months of use. Put on my car dash board and all holding screws are loose now</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my son loves it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-it">Not worth it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke in less than a month. Not worth it. Not even contacted for replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="think-before-you-buy">Think before you buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not stick - worked in the beginning - then started to fall for the iphone 7. Tried washing with warm soap water and let it air dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-pretty-terrible-the-arm-of-the-device-keeps-falling">This was pretty terrible. The arm of the device keeps falling &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was pretty terrible. The arm of the device keeps falling down when you hit even a small bump and it&rsquo;s switched to the lock position as far as it will go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-phone-holder">Perfect phone holder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this a couple months ago but didn&rsquo;t open it up until just recently. I regret not using it any sooner.</p>
