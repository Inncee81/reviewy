<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-picture-and-sound">Good picture and sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good picture and sound, but if you use the streaming services as I do, you will find the user interface different and a bit slow.. Update: I have been using this machine for about two months and when I attempt to access Network Services for streaming services, it crashes 40 to 50% of the time. I am very disappointed in Panasonic. I was holding out high hopes for Panasonic due to prior positive experience with their products. This unit replaced a high end Sony Blu ray which Replaced a middle of the line Samsung Blu ray, both with similar issues along with other faults. Oppo seems to be the only company producing reliable Blu Ray players these days. That must be why they demand such high prices. Again: You get what you pay for. It is too bad the major manufacturers can not produce a reliable Blu Ray player with better quality control for the prices they charge at least in their higher end units the way they did at one time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work">Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wanted to like this&hellip; but too many features just didn&rsquo;t work. I purchased this unit and a Sony BDP-S3200. In the end,while I really like Panasonic, I kept the Sony and returned the Panasonic.There were several features that I wanted that both units reported had. They are: 1.Closed Captioning Decoder, 2. Miracast,3.Fast loading/disc playback, 4.DLNA, 5.Netflix/Amazon Prime.Results:1. CC- Both units have closed captioning decoder, and both seem to work well. However, the Sony wins on this because the decoder works not just on discs, but also over the network. Also, the Sony allows the user to customize the appearance of the captions on the screen (although the options are still pretty limited).2. MIRACAST- Panasonic really let me down on this feature. It just did not work. The Panasonic worked briefly with my phone, but kept disconnecting. It stated that it was working with my Kindle, but all I actually saw was a blue background screen. On the Sony I was able to mirror my Samsung phone, Kindle Fire HDX, and a few other android devices. I did note however, that the Sony DOES NOT mirror my Windows 8 machine, and also requires the player and the device the user wants to mirror to both be connected to the same home network. I have a Netgear Push2TV that works with all my devices (including W8 PC) and doesn&rsquo;t require a home network. I had hoped to replace the netgear with the bluray player- but will not be able to.3.PLAYBACK- Panasonic wins the playback. All discs I used loaded faster and had much better picture quality on the Panasonic. I think the Panasonic must have better upscalling software or something. If you have an older TV or only 720P and your primary use for this device is disc playback, you may want to choose the Panasonic. Also, the Panasonic has a digital display/counter and the Sony does not. The load time for bluray discs on the Panasonic was about 10-30 secs. The Sony is a very slow 30-65 secs.4. DLNA- Again, Panasonic just did not work. I was really surprised by this, as I have an older Panasonic that connects to my network and plays back everything (even network tuners) without issue. The DMP-BDT360 could &ldquo;see&rdquo; the devices and my network, but refused to connect to the DLNA- and just froze up, requiring a hard reboot.The Sony performed better, although it will not play may file types (like mp4) over DLNA (despite what the manual states).5. APPS- Both machines require firmware updates before using Amazon Prime. The Panasonic has a Netflix button right on the remote, which is convenient. I didn&rsquo;t experience any issues connecting my accounts to the player or watching content.Initial setup was simple and straight forward for both devices. Also, the menus on both units were easy to navigate and attractive. However, I personally found the Sony easier and more natural (although not as aesthetically pleasing). Overall, I decided to return the Panasonic. If I had only needed a great bluray/DVD player for disc playback, then the Panasonic was a clear winner. However, too many features just did not work, and although the Sony isn&rsquo;t perfect, it was cheaper ($69 vs. $99 for the Panasonic) and most features worked with little/no issue.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-and-prefer-the-length">Works great, and prefer the length.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a older panasonic DVD, player which has been fantastic. So after alot of looking on amazon, and all the brands, it seem&rsquo;s all the blu ray have some issues at times.. They dont seem as reliable.But i wanted a blu ray that was bigger (longer) than most so that it goes better side by side or on top of my existing audio.And also still have a optical out jack.And this unit fit my needs and budget.Been using it now for few weeks and all seems great, even before i did a firmware update.. And after..Seems to be a good unit.. Time will tell.</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been looking for some time for a bluray player that wasn&rsquo;t tiny and had a digital display panel of some sort. I hate that stereo and video components these days are getting so small, but on the other hand TV&rsquo;s are getting bigger&hellip;strange. These components do not need to be downsized, I like the substantial appearance of these devices. So when I found this bluray player I was pleased with its proportions. However it isn&rsquo;t very deep but I realized I would have to compromise a little. This is a great bluray player, and has lots of internet driven abilities from Netflix to Hulu to Youtube and our favorite Amazon Prime, simply awesome. The HD video is outstanding, though the player takes some time to boot up and get running it still is a great player.</p>

<h5 id="panasonic-dmp-bdt360-screen-mirroring-not-working-blue-screen-of-death">Panasonic DMP-BDT360 Screen Mirroring Not Working - Blue Screen Of Death!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Returned the first one of this model for no screen mirroring from my Samsung devices and this one does the same thing, (BLUE SCREEN ONLY). Mirroring worked fine on the PanasonicDMP-BDT270 , Samsung BD-J6300 and the Sony BDPS1700 Blue-ray players but they were junk players for other reasons. The other features on this player seem to work as they should but Panasonic needs to update the support for mirroring. I&rsquo;d return this one except I can&rsquo;t find another player that is any better and with descent reviews. I bought a Warranty because I know this one probably won&rsquo;t last and that&rsquo;s a shame.All updates, Settings Ect. have been checked and rechecked with the same results. Normally an extremely easy option just won&rsquo;t work on this player so if you need that, look for something else.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">so far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed an up converting Blu-Ray player for my new 4K TV. I struck out on the Sony one everyone on this site loved after it stopped reading any disk in it and decided instead to go with a different brand. I am so far pretty delighted to have picked this one so I will go over some of its good features:first off the picture is amazing, it up coverts 1080p pictures to a really nice clarity on my 4K tv. you can definitely tell the difference. the built in apps are a nice feature too but I don&rsquo;t know many people that use their player for Netflixs (it does have a quick launch button on the remote for Netflixs which is cool if i decided to use it for that) other than that set up was easy, it has a quick launch feature which is nice so no complaints here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Old panasonic blu ray player died after year because the tray wouldn&rsquo;t open. Liked the overall product so I decided to go to a newer model&hellip; First day and the tray didn&rsquo;t open!</p>

<h5 id="you-probably-deserve-a-better-product">You probably deserve a better product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving this product a 1 because a lower number is not an option. I bought this to watch 4K on and it doesn&rsquo;t play 4K.</p>

<p>If I could give this a negative 5 stars I would. This is by far the WORST technology purchase I have ever made. I will never buy Panasonic again after this purchase.</p>

<p>This blu-ray player doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; plain and simple. It is supposed to play DVDs, but about 25% of them cease playing in the middle of the show, and nothing can be done to get&hellip;</p>
