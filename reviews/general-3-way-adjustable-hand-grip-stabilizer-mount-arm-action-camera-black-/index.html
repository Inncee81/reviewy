<blockquote>
<p><strong>2nd Attempt</strong> Amazon sent me a free replacement to try out and this one appears to be built a little better. I&rsquo;d stll say have your GoPro tethered or at least a floaty backing while doing a water sport<strong>UPDATE</strong> Great concept but it broke and I almost lost my GoPro in the river!! I had this clip in my pocket to attach it to my lifejacket while paddle boarding a couple weeks ago. I pull the clip out with my GoPro attached and I notice the bolt came loose for no reason so the swivel wouldn&rsquo;t work anymore. Luckily I had a tether to my GoPro as a back up because sure enough the clip fell apart into two pieces and I lost then &ldquo;claw&rdquo; in the river while catching my GoPro. I don&rsquo;t understand how the bolt wasn&rsquo;t secured down but this is a very dangerous risk to losing a GoPro.I bought this clip mount to use with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver attached to a backpack or sling bag when we go on hikes and camping trips. If you want a head mount just buy the GoPro head mount set-up because the camera is a bit too heavy to just clip onto any ball cap. This thing may be made in China so the quality control is spotty, but it works flawlessly and as described. The 360 degree rotary mechanism seems solid and has very positive clicks, probably about 20 clicks to go around one time. I mounted it to my left side backpack shoulder strap and it looks great plus you get a perfect angle view of everything in front of you. The camera tightens down just fine to the mount and the jaws are so stiff that you really can probably jog with this thing and it wouldn&rsquo;t move a bit. Great purchase and a good item to have in your GoPro accessory arsenal.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-a-pretty-strong-dude">I&rsquo;m a pretty strong dude</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dropped once and the neck which held the GoPro dropped off. =/ 30 minutes of use is all I got out of it. I feel it would have dropped if you didn&rsquo;t need so much force to open the darn thing up. I&rsquo;m a pretty strong dude, but when you have the camera on it it&rsquo;s kind of in the way when your attaching it to anything needing an insane amount of pressure. But over all shouldn&rsquo;t have broken from a 5ish food drop on hard dirt.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-cost">Great for the cost!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to attach my GoPro to my backpack strap, and it worked great. Then I found I could connect to a coat pocket or about anything else. I bought another model that swivels, which is a big improvement, but it costs a lot more plus took forever to get to me. This came in less that 48 hours with standard shipping. It attaches firmly, and sometimes is just fun to set GoPro in timed interval settings as I wonder around a city doing street photography with my DSLR. Some of those shots are just interesting candids. I know this is probably designed for video use I just don&rsquo;t ever shoot video, I did that for a living for years and now just prefer to shoot stills.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-pretty-good">So Far Pretty Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty solid piece. Judging from the reviews I was expecting a cheap flimsy china made pos that was going to break easily. Not so. Solid construction super tight jaw clamp. You need 2 hands to open it unless you are He Man with one hand. ( 2 fingers ) Rotating piece is good doesn&rsquo;t unscrew like some reviewers have said. 1 small issue is that it did not come with a thumbscrew. I used one of the many I had and it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit for some reason. It is a little finicky and you have to play with it to get it to screw on right. I think it was somehow the thread on the bolt. Seems to work ok now that I have used it a couple times.We will see how this holds up over time but for now not bad for under $5.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got this thing in today and man was I surprised of the quality!! It is study material right there. Would clamp it anywhere and not worry about it falling at all or coming apart. Strongly recommend . I love to travel so the fact that I can just clip this anywhere in my clothing/backpack and film is awesome . One of my fave go pro accesories. Easy to handle very durable</p>

<h5 id="awesome-versatile-clip-that-grips">Awesome Versatile Clip that Grips!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these clips for my GoPro, and they work really well.When I first bought them, I used it to attach to my hat, and the grip on the hat held up well. I simply had to loosen the hat so that the plastic didn&rsquo;t press on my forehead too much.While I originally bought this for my hat, I had totally forgotten about how the mount portion of the clip rotates and locks to a vertical angle when the clip is attached sideways. I almost bought a more expensive clip to use with a backpack!Overall great value for the money!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-value-clip-for-backpack-harnesses-and-other-gear">Fantastic value clip for backpack harnesses and other gear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to clip to my backpack harness to film a hiker&rsquo;s eye view of the trail. It clipped firmly and never shifted out of place. It even too a couple of zip line rides clipped to my belt harness with no worries. The clip is tight and would grip firmly to something as thin as as a jacket pocket or thick as a padded backpack strap or the aluminum awning of a tour boat.The swivel was great to align the camera to line up with the horizon from both pieces of gear. It connects simply and soundly to my GoPro Hero 3+ camera case, or I could use the extension arm for a 90 flip.The one drawback is that the hinge at the bottom of the case prevents me from getting it completely level. It either points down or up 15 degrees. For the price I decided to just make it work. This is a fantastic value to expand your GoPro mounting options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-and-simple">Awesome and simple.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is great. I clip my go pro session to it and the clip it to the bill of my hat. Works amazingly. I ended up buyin a other because I gave my first one to a friend to use because it worked so well. In my photo I have it clipped to my hat. Word great like that. Just make sure your hat is on somewhat snug.</p>
