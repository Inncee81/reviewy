<h5 id="it-works-but-with-a-couple-of-potential-drawbacks">It works but with a couple of &ldquo;potential&rdquo; drawbacks.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This booster basically does what they say it will, but with a huge caveat. I&rsquo;m experienced with Wilson since I had the Wilson sleek for a couple of years until it failed just after the warranty expired. So I decided to go all in and get the best booster they offer for use in my rv which we travel fulltime in. I also ordered the Wilson ac/dc adapter #859900, since the unit only comes with the 12v DC cigarette lighter type plug cord. I first set it up with the ac/dc adapter so it was running on a 120v AC power source and it worked wonderfully( 4-5 bars on the cell phone and internet pages loaded on about 2 seconds with it boosting our Verizon mifi card. But I really wanted to run the booster on 12v DC power in the rv because it&rsquo;s much more efficient than having our inverter convert 12 volt battery power to 120 volts and using the 120v AC plug. There is a significant waste, or loss of electricity in that conversion process of 12v DC to 120v AC. So running the booster on a 12v source saves precious battery life when camping off the grid and living on our batteries. What Wilson neglected to tell me or anyone else is that the two different power cords are putting completely different levels of power into the booster. The 12v DC plug that comes with the unit has a small conversion box half way down the length of the cord that converts the 12v DC power source down to 6v DC going into the booster. On the other hand, the 120v AC power cord has a box that converts the 120v AC power source down to 12v DC going into the booster. That&rsquo;s twice as much power as the 12v DC cord. As mentioned earlier, when hooked up to the 120v AC cord that reduces down to 12v, my internet pages load in 2 seconds. But when hooked up to the 12v DC cord that&rsquo;s reducing down to 6v, my internet pages take at least 20-30 seconds or longer to load.The other, related, but less significant issue is the heat coming off the booster. When running on the 12v DC cord the heat coming off the booster measures 98 deg.. When running on 120v AC, the heat measures 125 deg. and customer service admitted it can run as high as 150 deg., though they claim it will not damage the booster. 150 deg. is too hot to touch so you would want to be careful where you mount it so it doesn&rsquo;t touch flammable materials.I will give Wilson&rsquo;s customer service dept. credit for their quality of service. They answer fairly quickly(1-3 min), they speak clear English, they seem to be fairly knowledgeable about the products and they do seem eager to help. They offered to send me a 12v DC cord that does not reduce the voltage down to 6v. which should solve my slow internet problem, but I will still have a very hot unit with 12v going into it. Reducing the input power form 12v to 6v drastically reduces the performance of the booster. These differences are significant and should be made clear to prospective customers. In my four conversations with customer service prior to purchasing the unit, the difference in performance between 12v and 120v power sources was not mentioned.The booster appears to made of die cast metal and is very sturdy. When I first set it up, I was not getting all four green lights and learned from a follow-up call to customer service that you need to keep the inside antenna away from windows which causes the inside and outside antennas to compete and cause feedback that reduces effectiveness.I&rsquo;m now satisfied with the booster but there were some problems that had to be overcome.</p>

<h5 id="rv-owners-upgrade-the-external-antenna">RV owners - upgrade the external antenna!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get the BS out of the way, I own a Class A motorhome which is a fiberglass body. The magnetic mount external antenna will never work on fiberglass, it requires a ground plane (hence the magnet) from a metal body. Had this for 1 year and never saw it do anything for my signal. I was getting ready to throw it out but then decided to call Wilson tech support. They suggested I use silicon sealant to glue down a piece of flat metal to my RV roof to use the factory antenna. I did not buy a Newmar diesel to glue crap to my roof!So then they tell me that a new cellular exterior antenna has just been released for semi&rsquo;s and RVs. It is the 4G-OTR Antenna (Truck Edition). Priced is steep at $99.00, but I need maximum coverage when parked. I ordered one from Wilson and received it within 2 days. This thing is LONG, 19&rdquo; without the mount bracket, so I cannot mount it on the roof of my RV, it would clip the first bridge I went under. And, it must be mounted vertically to work correctly. I personally think it is too ugly to hang off the side of my RV to eliminate the height issue.I need this when I am parked, not driving. So I find this pesky tv antenna on my roof that has never been used&hellip;&hellip;..I used a piece of 1.25&rdquo; aluminum L and built a small mount that mounted to my crank-up antenna frame. When the antenna is raised, the cellular antenna is perfectly parallel. When the antenna is lowered for travel, the cellular antenna sits parallel to my roof. This works like a charm now, my signal went from -121 DB to -79 DB in the coach!</p>

<h5 id="helps-a-lot-in-remote-areas-with-weak-signal">Helps a lot in remote areas with weak signal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This made a huge difference in areas of marginal signal in Montana and Glacier NP, Yellowstone NP and Grand Teton NP and other places on our trip. The connections do get hot as mentioned by other reviewers but it can be handled without burning you. I didn&rsquo;t see any improvement in the DFW Texas area but we have a good signal so it&rsquo;s not really necessary. As mentioned by others, it can&rsquo;t boost a signal that&rsquo;s not there so no service means no service. It worked well on my Iphone 6S in an Otter Box. If you&rsquo;re in an area with weak signal, it&rsquo;s well worth the cost.</p>

<h5 id="mixed-results-as-soon-as-i-installed-it-it">Mixed results. AS soon as I installed it it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mixed results. AS soon as I installed it it fired right up. I went from zero to 4 bars with 4G in a grounded all aluminum toy hauler trailer. You have to stay very close as in within 6 feet to get the result. Because the trailer is mobile I had to get a vehicle booster so it is set up for close proximity to driver so I set it up by the couch. I haven;t traveled into the mountains yet so I will update later</p>

<h5 id="5-to-10db-boost-on-meter">5 to 10db boost on meter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tested it with a db meter. This is what you get. If you place the phone on the internal antenna you get a 25db increase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product. As advertised. Highest quality material.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the">Not worth the $$$</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I Have been using for nearly a year. Only noticeable difference is by placing device needing better signal on or within a couple inces of signal transmitting pad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-pretty-well">Works pretty well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have T-Mobile, and in rural areas where I used to get no signal at all, I now get three bars. It doesn&rsquo;t get me 4G speed but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While using this booster inside our RV we are able to boost our terrible phone signal enough to use the phones hot spot . We would not have Internet without it. (Out in tha woods)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-good-way-to-install-in-a-2012-toyota-camry">No good way to install in a 2012 Toyota Camry.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously owned the Wilson 3-watt 3G booster (installed in a Volvo S70) which worked pretty well up until the time that it didn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="makes-your-phone-better">Makes your phone better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It does boost the signal and allows you to signals where I couldn&rsquo;t without the weBoost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-buy">Worth the buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it gets hot. Yes, the signal booster only works within 3 feet of the transmitter. No, it will not CREATE signal, only BOOST available signal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seemed-to-be-the-best-option-so-i-am-pleased">seemed to be the best option so I am pleased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to have improved my cell signal, but I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to use it in many locations. It&rsquo;s a little bit of trial and error, but worth it for an extra bar or two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-it-now">Buy it now !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In 4 months I will open &amp; use it for the 1st time</p>
