<h5 id="blown-away-with-water-pressure-still">blown away with water pressure&hellip;still :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t generally write reviews of products but this shower head is outstanding! I agonized over buying this shower head to be honest. We had a nice handheld one but it was 2.5GPM, and water is really expensive where we live. So I broke down and bought this water saver. What I was worried about was that the water would come out way to slow and the soap would never get out of our hair&hellip;..my daughter and I both have crazy thick and curly hair. Well we received this little beauty and turned it on and while the water does come out different it came out with plenty of force to wash our hair fine. I can&rsquo;t believe actually that it comes out one entire gallon less then my old one because it sure doesn&rsquo;t seem like it. The next thing I want to point out is that the way that the shower head is on a swivel ball mean you can really really move it around which makes it really slick to clean your shower. I was playing with it and wasting water just the other day and I can almost spray over the top of the curtain towards the back of my shower enclosure. So if you are contemplating and water is horridly high like mine is give it a shot. I am sure glad that I did. &lt;3</p>

<h5 id="superior-shower-experience">Superior shower experience.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is amazing! It works so much better than our expensive-but-worthless &ldquo;Whirl Air / Rain Air&rdquo; 2.5 gpm Hansgrohe shower bar, despite using only 1.5 gpm max. The pressure this thing provides is awesome (probably 3-4x what we get out of the Hansgrohe). But, even better, the droplets don&rsquo;t come out in a fixed array of lines &ndash; it&rsquo;s turbulent and the droplets are constantly hitting everything in the cone of water. That means that you don&rsquo;t have to move around to rinse soap off &ndash; you can just stand still and it&rsquo;s constantly hitting every square millimeter of your skin.It&rsquo;s also sturdy, well-made, and beautiful. I&rsquo;m beyond impressed.The only drawback I can see is that it&rsquo;s a bit louder than our shower bar, but it&rsquo;s so spectacular in every other way that I could care less.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-head-well-worth-the-price">Terrific head - well worth the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We replaced our shower head as part of our effort to cut water consumption during Californiat&rsquo;s ongoing drought. what&rsquo;s particularly nice about this head is that it gives the impression of putting out a much heavier water flow than it actually does. I can&rsquo;t technically explain how it does this, but am convinced it played a moajor role in our near-50% reduction in water usage - AND it definitely feels like it&rsquo;s giving us way more than 1.5 GPM. Of course, shutting it off while we &ldquo;soap up&rdquo; surely makes a significant difference. But what we like about this particular head is that when we&rsquo;re rinsing, it feels like it&rsquo;s putting out a lot more than a meager 1.5 GPM.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-shower-head-will-amaze-you-it-is-so-good">This shower head will amaze you, it is so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I knew the shower head was going to be good based on everything I had read, but in fact it is truly amazing. I replaced a 2.5 GPM regular shower head with the High Sierra 1.5 GPM shower head and it felt like I had doubled the water flow. In addition the way the water comes down makes for an incredibly good shower. Can&rsquo;t recommended these highly enough, these shower heads truly revolutionize showering!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received the showerhead yesterday (Sunday!). It took about ten minutes to remove the old head and install the new one. I had already had my shower for the day so had to wait until this morning. Was a little apprehensive that a 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> GPM head was going to live up to the reviews I had read. It definitely does perform per the reviews. It&rsquo;s hard to believe the thoroughly drenching, large droplet, spray is only 1.5 GPM. Our old shower head was installed 13 years ago as part of a bathroom remodeling. I&rsquo;m sure the flow rate was at least 2.5 GPM. So saving a minimum of gallon a minute is worth every cent the High Sierra cost since we live with our own well and septic system. It is a nice looking showerhead but when compared to the multi-spray pattern monsters that get all the attention it may come up a little short in terms of appearance. In my opinion the important characteristic is not the size, shape or number of different spray patterns, it is its ability to save water while offering a single spray pattern that gives the user the satisfying feel of a lot more water, at a seemingly higher pressure, than is actually the case.</p>

<h5 id="exceeded-my-high-expectations">Exceeded my High Expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 1.5gpm High Sierra shower-head is incredible! I was debating between the 1.5gpm and 1.8gpm, because I wanted more pressure than my 1.75gpm other brand shower-head was giving, and I took the risk of buying the 1.5gpm and I am glad I did. The High-Sierra 1.5gpm is much better all around than my 1.75gpm other brand shower-head. I&rsquo;d guess that the High-Sierra 1.5gpm shower-head feels more like a 2.25-2.5gpm shower-head, which makes me wonder if High-Sierra will eventually create a 1.2gpm model in future.Compared to my 1.75gpm other brand shower-head, this 1.5gpm High Sierra shower-head:- Has stronger pressure and feels like I am getting about 0.5gpm more water when I am actually using 0.25gpm less, rinses me off faster, which saves me time and even more water.- Swivels much wider - which is nice because I can face the water where I want it when cleaning the shower or away from me while waiting for hot water to arrive, which saves me time and even more water.Other things to note:- Since I am using less hot water, less steam gets into my bathroom resulting in my being able to see into my mirror sooner and I can turn my bathroom fan off sooner. This also means less humidity in my house, which makes my air conditioner happy, lowers the risk of mold, etc.- Using less hot water means less heating fuel and means my garage (where my water heater is) stays cooler in the summer.- Means my hot water heater can work less and less likely to run out of hot water.- I got the model with the trickle valve - the valve functions smoothly and is really easy to use - I lather up without water on - saves me water. After using the valve for a couple of weeks it will be come a nice habit.</p>
