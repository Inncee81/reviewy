<h5 id="one-of-the-best-purchases-i-have-ever-made-in-my-life-yes-my-life">One of the BEST purchases I have ever made in my life! Yes, my LIFE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this along with one of Haiers compact washing machines a few months back which I am going to write a review for as well. In agreement with another user, I too want to have this dryer&rsquo;s babies. We live in a two bedroom apartment and we were becoming fed up with laundromats and the community laundry facility where you pay through the nose (including $9 for the card) to use old, dirty broken down washers and dryers that are the same size as the ones I purchased. I probably spent about as much on doing my laundry at those facilities in one year as it cost to purchase this machine. No joke. Of course all things considered we have kids and a dog so that would be the case but even for the single person the costs add up. I can honestly tell you this thing is worth every cent. We set it up in one of our bathrooms and it sits perfectly on the counter. IMO it dries as well if not better than my mothers brand new $1200 LG. I have only ever used the time dry setting and it takes usually between 45 minutes to an hour to completely dry the clothes depending on what I am drying and how big the load is. There are a few downfalls but the pros most definitely outweigh the cons here. First , it does have a weird smell when you first start using it. The off-gassing as one user mentioned. It was irritating at first but it eventually faded and Downey Unstopables helped out a lot with that problem. Second, my electricity bill did go up. It went up about $15-20 every month. Do I care? Not at all. With as busy as I am with work it is a welcome expense to not have to see the inside of a laundromat for any period of time. Third down fall is the heat it causes in the house. Leave the windows open. Easy fix. I love how easy this had made apartment hunting this time around. We live in an area with very few options as far as affordable rental living. Few of those units offer a washer dryer or hookups and if they do, you will be charged an average of $250 a month more in rent because of it. So if you find yourself in a similar situation and you are considering buying this product, my honest opinion is just buy it.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="good-but-could-be-better">Good, but could be better&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this long enough to say that it lives up to the manufacturer&rsquo;s claims, and upholds Haier&rsquo;s growing reputation as a quality brand rising above the morass of cheap and shoddy products which all too often embarrass China. My complaints are minor, but if anyone from Haier reads this and makes some changes, then it&rsquo;s worth my time to note them. The worst thing is the two-piece lint filter. Even if you remove the lint every time, the inner filter fills up, and you have to vaccuum it out. The next worst thing is with the mounting bracket. If the two holders were spaced 16 inches apart, they could be screwed directly to studs. As it is, you&rsquo;re advised to attach a sheet of plywood (not included!) to studs, and attach the holders to that. I settled for leaving mine on the floor, which brings us to my third complaint: the controls are located below the door, which is fine if it&rsquo;s wall-mounted. It might be better if the controls could be placed beside the door, but maybe not. That&rsquo;s a very minor complaint, I&rsquo;ll admit.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="apartment-size">Apartment size&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it and am satisfied but I have to give this only 3 stars because the belt broke within the first 3 months. A little hard to replace but I did it myself so that was great. It takes a little longer drying clothes than your average washer and dryer but it is energy efficient and fits great in a one bed apartment. It drys about half a standard load of laundry. It is tiny, takes a while but well worth the investment for now. Saves me from leaving my apartment to find quarters and a laundry mat&hellip; within a year this has paid for itself with all the quarters, gas and time I would of spent elsewhere.I came back to edit this review because even though I had to replace a belt I have not had any other problems what so ever with it, it is easy to work on if anything should wear out and the parts are not expensive so with that alone I give it a 4 star. Won&rsquo;t give it a 5 because it does take a little longer to dry clothes than the average standard washer. I was 3 loads a day and this has saved me time and money not having to leave my apartment.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="haier-hlp140e-dryer">Haier HLP140E Dryer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had a &ldquo;SpaceMaker&rdquo; washer/dryer combination where the washer just gave out one day after 15 years of use. I decided then and there I would not buy a single combination unit again and went for separate washer and dryer, that way you replace one part and not the whole unit. I bought this dryer as it fit my need and was within my price range.I have had the unit for a month and think the dryer is very good. People complain about the small amount of clothes you can dry but after having the SpaceMaker I am used to doing more smaller loads. I have also been combining this dryer with a drying rack. I take the wet clothes out of the washer, let them air dry for up to 8 hours then put them in the dryer. This process has greatly reduced the time I need to use the dryer and what I have done in the past with my SpaceMaker unit. So far, so good. I have no complaints. I also don&rsquo;t think it is that loud compared to my old dryer, even though Haier dryer has a slight larger capacity than the SpaceMaker. I am single and can fit all my clothes in the dryer, including a Queen size sheet, without problems. For towels I only put two at a time, but I pre-dry them as it saves time and energy.I have also decided not to mount it on the wall. It weighs about 50 lbs but I am afraid it could come crashing down on my washer. Maybe some others are brave but not me. I don&rsquo;t trust my walls to hold it. I am using a simple cart that I bought on Amazon.com that fits the bill.All in all I replaced a SpaceMaker unit with a washer, dryer and cart for less money so I can&rsquo;t complain.READ MORE</p>
