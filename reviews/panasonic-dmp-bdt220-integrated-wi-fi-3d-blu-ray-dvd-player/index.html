<p>The purpose of my review thus far is to include a few images I didn&rsquo;t have upon purchase that others may want to see. The only way to do this is to write an actual review so I will update as I use the player more over time. At first glance the player is well made and is no larger than a good sized tablet. You can hold it in one hand. I have an image included of it next to our already small cable box (32&rdquo; tv above). It really is not much larger than a disc case. Setup was painless and I purposely avoided even looking at the directions for this reason, to see how hard it would be with no understanding of the product. I had it ready to go in less than 10 minutes. The hardest part was turning on my laptop to get the wifi security code. The power cord is similar in shape and size to a cellular adapter.. even the plug is the same. There are only two connections on the back of the player.. the power and the HDMI port.. that&rsquo;s it. So for those who are wondering, there is no ethernet port to connect via cable. It&rsquo;s all wireless.. and if your TV for some reason doesn&rsquo;t have an HDMI port you&rsquo;ll need an adapter. The remote is easy to use and if you have a Panasonic TV it will operate that as well. Pictures below and i&rsquo;ll update as I use it more.*For quick reference since Amazon chose not to give much at all of a description of the product they&rsquo;re selling, here is the Panasonic page that describes this player and its features in full detail.[&hellip;]</p>

<h5 id="this-wifi-blu-ray-player-rocks-its-the-best-of-its-class">This WiFi Blu ray Player ROCKS!! Its the best of its class!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before I purchased this Panasonic DMP-BDT220 WiFi Blu-Ray DVD Player, I had researched virtually every player available on the market. There&rsquo;s a lot to pick from, but I wanted to find the player that had the best all-around features, and a great price that would fit my budget. And after looking at a dozen or so different players, I concluded that this Panasonic player was the best pick in its price range. Other players, have various other options, a varied amount of output connections, and may specify on-board memory configurations, etc. While this player does not specify the memory amount, it appears to be sufficient enough to load streaming media (such as Netflix, Amazon Video or Hulu Plus and play it back without any hesitation or pauses.After receiving the player, I hooked it up, and it worked perfectly right from the start. Found my WiFi network without any problems. I entered the security password information and it was connected to my WiFi network and my Internet connection in seconds. Even configured itself with connecting to my other devices and PCs on my network also without any problems. I did not have to enter any network address configurations or anything except for the router/network access password. I was able to instantly see the pictures and videos on my shared PCs on my home network.I use this for my Netflix streaming and it works great with no problems at all. And there is no lag time between the apps selection under the Internet portion of the player, but that might be because I&rsquo;m using this on a fairly high-speed <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> broadband connection.I&rsquo;ve also used several of the other Internet apps on the player, and they all worked great as well.The Pros of this player is that it worked perfectly right out of the box, and it was a snap to setup, connect to the Internet through my WiFi network, and very easy to tell it to automatically download and update the firmware. This can also be done by downloading the firmware file from a computer and putting it on a CD-ROM or a flash drive, and then inserting that into the player, and the player will then see it, and automatically update the firmware.The only Cons of this player, if one at all, would be that it lacks a second HDMI or Component HD connection on the back of the player, but for me, that wasn&rsquo;t a problem, as I connected this player, using the HDMI connection, directly to my HDTV. It does offer also an optical digital audio out connection, which I have connected to my Sony 7.1 Home Theater System, and it works perfectly. Blu-Ray movies look and sound GREAT!!ALL IN ALL, I think this is a terrific WiFi Player from Panasonic and I think anyone would be very satisfied with this player. I know I am. And doing a lot of research before I purchased this did help in picking a very good player. I think it&rsquo;s the best WiFi Blu-Ray player in its price category.One last suggestion though, is to purchase a color calibration DVD, which is available on Amazon, to calibrate or re-calibrate your TV using the Blu-ray Player. This will assure you that your television is set correctly, for not only color, but also for hue, brightness and contrast as well.</p>

<p>Bought the DMP-BDT220 to replace a DMP-BDT110 that Amazon agreed to take back after the return period had already ended. That player was terrible. From day one it suffered from constant audio and video dropouts when watching both discs and Netflix streaming. I decided to let it ride hoping an eventual firmware upgrade would cure the problem but that didn&rsquo;t work. So I read that Panasonic had just released their 2012 lineup of Bluray players and I decided I would give them one more chance. I own many Panasonic products and most of them are top notch so I was hoping the DMP-BDT110 was just an anomaly.The 220 arrived today and I quickly connected it using only an HDMI cable and the power cable since it is wifi capable. It connected with no problem to my network and after entering my password, Netflix worked fine - no video problems, no audio problems. Time will tell if that continues. Popped in a Bluray disc to check that out and watched for a few hours and once again - no video problems, no audio problems. Things are looking good.I can&rsquo;t speak whatsoever on the 3D aspect of the player because I don&rsquo;t have a 3D TV. I bought the 220 just to get the Viera Connect feature which includes Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Streaming. In 2D, picture quality and audio is great for both discs and streaming.The remote is fine but I use a Harmony remote so it will probably just be put away.The only negative things I have to say about the 220 is I find the menu system to be a bit clunky and when you get into the Viera Connect menu button pushes become a little laggy. If every net connected device worked like Roku, the world would be a better place.So in conclusion, I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with the 220. I got rid of a cable on the back, in the brief time that I used it the dropouts seem to have been corrected and the picture and sound are great.Last, I would like to thank Amazon for taking the 110 back because it was legitimately beyond the return period. That&rsquo;s why I like Amazon, that&rsquo;s why I am an Amazon Prime member and that&rsquo;s why I will continue to spend money with them.Update - May 19, 2012: After two months of working fine, I put the Chronicle blu ray in tonight and the player wouldn&rsquo;t play the disc. It kept defaulting back to the Panasonic home screen like it didn&rsquo;t have a disc in. I unplugged the player for a minute and plugged it back in. The disc was recognized but then when the movie started, the audio began dropping out every 5-10 seconds. We took the disc upstairs and it played flawlessly on an older LG blu ray player. After the movie ended, I took the disc back downstairs to try and diagnose the problem. On a whim I turned off the BD Live feature and the disc played fine during the portion that was dropping out previously. Maybe just a fluke but that&rsquo;s still not functioning properly. I&rsquo;m going to monitor but if it starts doing it again, I am returning the BDT220 and then I am done with Panasonic blu ray players.Update - June 2nd, 2012: The BD Live off wasn&rsquo;t the fix. Did some more research and it sounds more and more like it is an HDMI handshake issue involving copyright protection on discs.I ordered a set of the latest version HDMI cables and if this doesn&rsquo;t work, I am going to get a Sony BDP-S390.Update - July 15th, 2012: Didn&rsquo;t get around to using a new HDMI cable but I haven&rsquo;t had any problems since the Chronicle blu ray disc.Update - June 5th, 2013: Pleased to say that after several firmware updates, it is playing nice with everything EXCEPT The Trailer Park Boys box set.</p>
