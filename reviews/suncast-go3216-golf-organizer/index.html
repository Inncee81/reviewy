<blockquote>
<p>You will need help to assemble this unit properly otherwise I would have given this five stars. I assembled this alone and it took me longer than it should have because the fasteners provided and used in the design are flush mounted so as not to have any fasteners protruding from the rack after assembled. Also, one of the casters would not screw in because the mig weld on the nut warped the nut itself on the leg and the threads were screwed up. I know this because I worked in a metals furniture factory for years. The finished unit is sturdy, looks very good and holds all of the golf gear that we put on it with room to spare. It&rsquo;s worth the money to me personally.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shipping notification was the fastest I&rsquo;ve ever seen on Amazon. I received a shipping email confirmation in less than 2 hours with this product and recieved it just as fast.Granted as the rest of the reviews have stated the organizer is better to put together with 2 people. The directions are easy to understand and decently well written to say the least. I got the organizer put together in atleast 45 Minutes. The base and back were the biggest pain, because you had to line up the holes and you can&rsquo;t lay them flat because the side panels cause a space and the base mesh gets in the way. Still it&rsquo;s an easy item to put together.My main concern was the Mesh and the Metal quality, there was a really small part of the mesh that was damaged on the base but it wasn&rsquo;t a problem and not even noticeable, so I can&rsquo;t complain about it really seeing as how it didn&rsquo;t affect the organizer, it&rsquo;s structural integrity, and it didn&rsquo;t look broken or shaby when trying to look for it. Like I said it wasn&rsquo;t even noticeable. The metal needed to be moved around alittle to get it to fit right, but again nothing was damaged, unbalanced, or affected by it. My concern was that the mesh and metal should be of better quality / stronger.After all is said and done and put together the organizer was sturdy and fit solid. When I stepped back and looked at the final product with all of my golf equipment on it, it looks really professional and clean. So I would deffinatly suggest this product for the price, product, and look.The organizer fits my bag, bag stand attachment, and whelled caddy cart with ease. The top shelf is great if you have a large supply of golf balls. The rest of the shelves are great if you have Golf Shoes and other items.Like I said it&rsquo;s a great product and it makes everything look professionaal and clean.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this product for my husband and as it arrived while he was out of town, I easily put it together and had it waiting when he returned home. He noticed it right away and immediately rescued his golf clubs from the dark corner of the garage and set about organizing his little world. It&rsquo;s been several months and the organizer is used faithfully, and has eliminated the &ldquo;Honey have you seen my _________?&rdquo; You gals know what I mean - - like I can wear his size 14 golf shoes! It was easy to put together and it&rsquo;s very stable and sturdy. I am pleased with this purchase.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-assembling-alone-be-a-challenge">Excellent quality, assembling alone be a challenge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Once assembled, it&rsquo;s excellent. However, the assembly can be a bit of a bear if doing it by yourself. Some of the holes didn&rsquo;t line up perfectly, and since you really have to use opposing Allen wrenches to handle the screws, you need another set of hands when things don&rsquo;t line up perfectly. However, the extra effort to assemble was worth it. The final product is excellent. Nice touches, from the great packaging to the leveling feet and padded edges, demonstrate the quality.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="nice-organizer-with-some-minor-upgrading">Nice Organizer with some minor upgrading.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I shopped around before settling on this organizer. The price was reasonable and it seemed to be an adequate size for my one set of clubs, bag and pull cart. I had read other feedback about it not being too strong so I added some minor reinforcement. I had some <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch thick fiberboard that I added to the bottoms of each shelf. I also added it to the back and sides where the bag and clubs go. I used some #6 machine screws with washers and star washers. I anticipate a long life for this rack as I&rsquo;m 59 and no one else uses it but me. I don&rsquo;t throw stuff into it. I put them in. With the protective boards I don&rsquo;t expect much if any damage.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="pretty-much-as-described">Pretty much as described</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, I like it, but there were a few flaws, and it&rsquo;s not quite as useful as it could be &hellip; thus four stars instead of five.I put it in the corner of my garage and it looks nice. I have a cart bag and a few extra clubs, umbrellas, etc., all of which sit quite nicely in the left side.I can get two pairs of shoes in the bottom shelf if I stack them atop each other. Only one pair in the second shelf, but I only have three pairs, so that&rsquo;s just right. The third shelf is good for golf balls &hellip; room for several dozen. The top shelf will serve well as a general junk hamper because it has a bottom and four sides.All of that is well and good, and it would have been nearly perfect if it would have also had room for extra stuff &hellip; hats, towels, extra head covers &hellip; and that sort of stuff. I may put some hooks on the wall above the unit for that.Assembly was fine &hellip; no problems, and no extra tools required (two hex keys included). The gage of the metal is adequate, but I think it should have been a bit better for something that costs $70+, and there is a crease in the mesh in one area (alhtough it is not noticeable when in use) &hellip; otherwise, I found the product quality (fit, finish, etc.) to be good. One of the pieces of foam trim was not installed correctly so I&rsquo;ll have to get some double-sided tape to reinstall it, but I consider that a very minor issue.I had considered building one out of wood but decided to take the easy way out. All-in-all, I&rsquo;m happy I have this unit, but if I had it to do all over again I would probably build one so that I could get exact what I want for the same or less money.READ MORE</p>
