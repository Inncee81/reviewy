<h5 id="replacement-lithium-4400mah-batteries-for-neato-xv-series">Replacement Lithium 4400mAh Batteries for Neato XV Series</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have previously purchased a set of lithium replacement batteries for my Neato XV Signature that were identical in every way to these with the minor exception of having a different name on the label. All of the 4400mAh batteries currently available for the XV series here on Amazon were produced by the same company; the only difference is a dollar or two in the price. I wrote an extensive review of my original ones so I won&rsquo;t repeat myself here, but suffice to say that I love them and they work perfectly in my Neato while managing to fix every issue I had, including navigation issues, vision issues, and short lifespan between charges.Regardless, it goes without saying that the weak spot in the Neato XV series robotic vacuums is the stock batteries. The original nickel batteries had poor capacity and even worse voltage regulation - all now in the past with these replacements. The price for the XV series bots is now going low enough (thanks to more current models being introduced) that if you want to buy a great robot and prevent many issues that have plagued these vacuums right from the start (or want to breathe new life into your older unit) you certainly can&rsquo;t go wrong with lithium. I purchased a factory refurbished XV-21 for my sister recently and before I even gave it to her I installed these batteries and it works absolutely like new. Since you&rsquo;re going to have to replace the stock nickel batteries every 6-12 months anyways, why not just go ahead and spend about twice the amount and get a battery that will last FOUR TIMES longer and prevent (or cure) many problems from the get-go.These lithium batteries truly make the Neato XV-series bots live up to their potential. Strongly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-upgrade">Amazing upgrade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical about putting a Li-ion battery in a device designed for NiMH, but the reliability of the NiMH batteries I have tried were bad enough that I figured I should give these a chance. I am impressed with the consistency and endurance of these batteries. The controller in these batteries does a good job of simulating the thermistor and voltage signatures the vacuum expects to communicate battery state to the robot. With these batteries, my Neato performs better than it ever did.</p>

<h5 id="i-installed-and-charged-them-as-indicated-typically-the-vacuum-with-the-old-batteries-in-good-condition-would-complete-in-one-ch">I installed and charged them as indicated typically the vacuum with the old batteries in good condition would complete in one ch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far these are not working for me. I installed and charged them as indicated typically the vacuum with the old batteries in good condition would complete in one charge as the batteries started to fade it needed to recharge then got to the point where is needed three or more recharges before it wouldn&rsquo;t even make it off the charging station. These new batteries first run needed to recharge to finish the cleaning. Now it tells me the dirty bin is not in when clearly it is. Not sure why this is all of a sudden a problem. I&rsquo;m contacting Neato but seems odd the problem just started. If they blame the batteries&hellip; back these will come and I hope it has not damage my vacuum.</p>

<h5 id="a-clean-sweep-for-this-vendor">A clean sweep for this vendor.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the batteries two days ago and installed them yesterday. I charged them overnight. I started the vacuum this morning and it has now been running for one hour and fifteen minutes and is still going strong. I received my three filters yesterday and they fit perfectly. Time will tell how long these batteries will last but this is my third set of Lithium batteries and they generally last about two years. I love my Neato cleaner.This vendor is very concerned about customer relations and has contacted me twice to make sure I am happy with my purchase. I think they are a company you would like to do business with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>firs batch konked out after 3 weeks but they replaced them in a hurry and honored their guarantee. We&rsquo;ll see how long they last. They vacuum longer that the nicads</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="on-time-and-functioning-as-advertised-so-far">On time and functioning as advertised, so far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Service was great and shipping was fast! The special installation instructions worked. My XV-21 does my whole condo in one pass again and now with some energy left in the batteries. This vendor did a great job considering the Neato&rsquo;s internals did not anticipate this battery chemistry in their design. The real test will be one of longevity. After market NiMH packs have been lasting 8 - 12 months before the run time got too low to be useful. I&rsquo;m expecting more from these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-vacuuming">Happy Vacuuming</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have only had these for three days, but they appear to be a big improvement over my three-year old &ldquo;original equipment&rdquo; batteries that came with the Neato XV Signature vacuum. I have two vacuums with the replacement batteries. I followed Neato&rsquo;s and the battery manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions very closely for the set-up process. My Neato Signatures are now running twice as long and seem to be cleaning the floors better. I am happy with my purchase.</p>
