<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="this-works-for-people-with-amd">This works for people with AMD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Both my husband and I have Macular Degeneration, we have purchased many magnifying glasses and like this the best. The magnifying len is big enough so we don&rsquo;t have to keep moving it to read, the 4 led lights are well disperse and bright, the slightly narrowed handle is comfortable to hold and it is not heavy. Really like the fact that it uses regular battery (3 AAA) so no need to keep special battery and also very easy to change the batteries. I will be ordering more to have one in each room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-reading-magnifier-i-ve-ever-used">Best reading magnifier I&rsquo;ve ever used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is without a doubt the best hand-held magnifier I have used, and I&rsquo;ve tried many of them. I have very low vision so cannot read most books without one. What sets this one apart is:1. I can actually read across the page without having to constantly move the device left and right. I was very surprised by this, since the lens width is just under 5&rdquo;, but I actually have no trouble seeing the entire width of a book page at a single glance. And the lens being rectangular rather than circular gives much more viewing flexibility.2. The illumination is superior to any other magnifier I have seen in this price range. Most hand-helds have a bulb at one end of the lens and the illumination of the visual field is not uniform. The part of the lens away from the bulb is darker and often unusable. But this magnifier has an LED bulb at each of the four corners of the lens, making the illumination uniform and quite bright.I have tried and thrown out more magnifiers than I can count for making my reading experience awkward and tiring. But this one is a keeper. It has everything I&rsquo;ve always wanted in a hand-held and didn&rsquo;t believe was out there. Fantastic purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-ultra-bright-magnimax-reader-has-changed-my-life">The Ultra Bright Magnimax Reader Has Changed My Life!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have just ordered my third handheld magnifier by Magnimax. I have macular degeneration and have tried multiple magnifiers with litle results until I tried the Magnimax one with four led lights. What a difference! I can now read articles in my morning paper, not just the headlines. I have bought this third one to keep in my new car, Now, I have one at the kitchen table for reading my morning newspaper or looking up recipes; one in my bedroom to finally read my subscriptions; and, now, one in my car for maps or emails on my LG phone. I often use my magnifier to assist me in reviewing my comments, such as this, where I cannot enlarge the print..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly Recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend this product. I got it so I can easily read my Bible which has very small print (one of the larger Bible&rsquo;s). It works great&hellip;the lighting is perfect (it has 2 settings) and the magnification is just right. I like the case which will keep it clean&hellip; along with the cleaning cloth. The size is just right for my small hands. I do still wear my reading glasses while using this product but now I&rsquo;m able to read my Bible without any trouble at all. So, quite happy&hellip;I also received a very nice email from the seller to make sure that I was a satisfied customer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="had-to-get-a-replacement-but-happy-overall">Had to get a replacement, but happy overall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product is great, when it works. Unfortunately our first one didn&rsquo;t work (LEDs didn&rsquo;t work, tried 2 different sets of batteries). Customer service was prompt in getting a replacement sent out. So far the newest one is working as I expected it to, so I&rsquo;m pleased overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-and-this-is-exactly-i-need-for-my">Good product and this is exactly I need for my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product and this is exactly I need for my reading since I have issues in my eyes, eye glass is not enough while I read books with small prints at night time and lights are great option added to make my life easy. I liked the idea of 2 option on light which I can adjust easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="plus-and-negative">PLUS and NEGATIVE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sturdy. Comfortable for viewing books because of size. illumination a big plus. .But what does one do to replace LED lights when they burn out? Magnification very mediocre. Compared to my Bausch and Lomb 3X magnifier, this one definitely seems like a one or two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-magnification-works-fine-but-you-can-buy-an-equal-glass-for-half">The magnification works fine but you can buy an equal glass for half &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lights did not work even after rechecking batteries and following directions. Two emails to the given address prompted two courteous replies, the second one promising a replacement that would arrive the next week. This occurred 10/13/17. I have received no replacement as of 11/3/17. The magnification works fine but you can buy an equal glass for half the price. Buy this only if you want to pay twice as much as its worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-to-use-when-on-the-go">great product to use when on the go</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 89 yr old mother has macular degeneration and she needed to carry something she could use to read with. This is ideal for that</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective">Defective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived today. Would not work. Used new batteries, put them in and out several times. Still did not work. Very disappointing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-large-size">Great large size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these for my 88 year old father to replace smaller less quality square magnifiers. They are great! Nice large lens, fantastic LED lights.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-most-useful-magnifier">My most useful magnifier</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second magnipros The addition of the second level of light intensity is wonderful!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lightweight; works well. Just as described.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing quality, it&rsquo;s real glass instead of the floppy plastic so no dizziness when you move. Definitely worth spending a couple bucks more on this magnifying glass!</p>
