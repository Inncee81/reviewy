<h5 id="impressive-looking-solidly-built-and-worth-the-money">Impressive looking, solidly built, and worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I now have the best looking basketball goal in the neighborhood. The Pro Dunk Gold is impressive looking and solidly built. There is no backboard rattle or vibration. There is no sway of the pole. It looks and acts very much like a professional basketball goal. I can adjust it from regulation 10 feet height for my older son down to 5 feet for my younger daughter. I even had a guy walking down the street stop and tell me how nice it looks. It is more expensive than many but I believe it is worth it.I installed it myself. The most difficult step was digging the hole. That took several hours. It is a larger than average hole to dig because it is a larger than average size and weight basketball setup. It was delivered on a pallet and weighed about 500 pounds. I used 26 of the 50 lb bags of Quikrete mix. I mixed each bag individually in a wheelbarrow. It was time consuming but not that difficult once I got into a rhythm after the first few. It took about 3 hours to mix it all and fill up the hole. I let it cure for a full week since we had a few days of rain during the week.Setting up the pole and cross/linkage bars wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. I set it up with my 14 and 16 year old sons. However, I had a friend from work help my sons and I install the backboard. That is the heaviest and most awkward step. Having the extra person made it much easier.The video gave a realistic look at the setup. The directions in the manual were mostly accurate and understandable. The only confusion I had with the directions was about leveling the pole when attaching it to the base. I had to jump ahead to the end of the directions when it talked about how to level the entire setup to understand how to level the pole.We&rsquo;ve been shooting around several times since installing it and it looks and responds like a pro! It is professional looking, solid, and will last a long long time. If this is in your price range, you will not be disappointed.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-goal">Great goal!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The size of the post makes the difference in this system. The backboard stays steady - no waving or wobbling. My height adjustment mechanism failed almost the first week of use, but it was quickly replaced at no cost to me. And we&rsquo;ve had no issues now through at least 6 months of almost everyday use. Love the goal!</p>

<h5 id="great-goal-would-buy-again">Great Goal &ndash; Would buy again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my 15 year old son has 6-7 other kids over all the time and in 20 seconds they can lower it to 8.5 feet and phi slamma jamma over each other all the time and hang on the rim etc and it is solid as a rock &ndash; very pleased &ndash; the guy that installed it for me too said he installs for 4-5 different companies and that the quality of the ProDunk is the best of any of them and it&rsquo;s what he has at his house- one warning on delivery though, they deliver this thing with a regular size semi so they will not come down the drive and I have a gravel drive and they had no way to get the boxes down my drive ( this thing comes in 4-5 parts and some are bulky and heavy )- I was lucky in that I have a truck with a dovetail trailer and we were able to off load the boxes onto that in the middle of the road but if I had not had that I have no idea what we would have done to get the goal to the house so be prepared for this if you do not live in a sub division !</p>

<h5 id="exceeded-expectations-quality-hoop-stands-up-to-big-teenage-players">Exceeded expectations, Quality hoop stands up to big teenage players</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We recently moved to a new home in northern Michigan. I did a lot of research, read many customer reviews and spoke directly with &ldquo;Ryan&rdquo; before finally deciding that the Pro Dunk Platinum hoop would be the best quality basketball hoop product and fit for our family. Ryan was very helpful and knowledgeable, not pushy about what choice would best suit our needs. I was a bit hesitant purchasing the hoop all the way from Texas. Ryan assured me that we would receive the entire system within a few days. He was right, everything arrived as scheduled, packaged well. The installation instructions/video were very precise and easy to follow. My 16 and 18 year old sons have been out on the driveway shooting hoops every day since it was installed last month. Friends have joined them often and everyone comments on what a quality hoop it is. My boys are both over 6 feet tall, love to dunk and hang from the rim. At first, I was a nervous wreck about it withholding all of their weight, but it is manufactured to handle this kind of play. Our satisfaction level with the Pro Dunk Hoop far exceeds our expectations.</p>
