<h5 id="fun-for-the-whole-family">Fun for the whole family.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so fun to play with!I got these for my 9 yr old twins.They were so excited.I think the hardest thing about something like this is the waiting.My kids were giving me updates like every 30 minutes. lolThey were constantly standing over them lifting them in their hands and letting them slip back into the water.We loved the feel.These took less than 48 hours to get their biggest and was larger than a golf ball.I would recommend being careful if you have longer nails so you don&rsquo;t knick these as they could break when expanding.We have no complaints about these. Definitely, would recommend.By the way, these work great in vases. I have used smaller beads for over a year now with some artificial flowers. (I add water as needed and every few months I rinse them off so they stay clean.)</p>

<h5 id="and-they-really-are-like-magic-it-s-crazy-how-such-a-small-amount">and they really are like magic. It&rsquo;s crazy how such a small amount &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These water beads are astonishing. They&rsquo;re the first kind I&rsquo;ve ever tried, and they really are like magic. It&rsquo;s crazy how such a small amount of teeny beads can expand into marble-sized, bright jelly beads.These tiny water beads come packed inside a secure, resealable plastic bag, with the majority of them appearing yellow.But I wasn&rsquo;t sure of the degree of difference, since visually, bright yellow pops out better than other colors.The directions are very simple and clear, but an adult should always supervise kids in the process. I poured a single teaspoon of beads into a medium-sized glass vase. Then I added 4 cups of Brita water. The purer the water is, the better the beads turn out. So purified water may yield the best results, compared with plain tap water, which has chemicals in it.Try to stick to the directions as much as possible, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be an exact science. Just don&rsquo;t veer too off course, especially on your first try.Within a mere 5 minutes, I could see the solid beads softening and growing slightly. The almost immediate change was obvious, and I felt really excited. I knew things were gonna go well.I placed my clear glass vase on my bathroom counter, but I kept staring into it frequently, noticing the different stages of the beads&rsquo; growth.As they soaked in the water, their shapes became somewhat less symmetrical. They looked like colorful little transparent blobs in the water. Or possibly like really pretty fungus. Ok that sounds gross. But it&rsquo;s true.Within 20 minutes, it was undeniable- these beads were rapidly taking in the water and expanding. Not in any major way, but the beads were certainly feeling right at home in that vase.By the time 5 hours passed, these water beads looked incredible. They were all almost the size of marbles, and the various translucent colors were bright and lovely.I couldn&rsquo;t help sticking my hand in and playing around with the slick, cold and soft jelly-like beads. No one can help doing that. It just feels so cool.Several hours in, the water level was at about half of the height of all the beads in the vase. I periodically shook up the vase a bit during the growth period, so that all the beads would receive an equal amount of water. This isn&rsquo;t required, but I chose to, just in case.The full submerging and growth of these water beads takes about 7-10 hours.Try to avoid keeping the beads in water for too long; after 10 hours, they can get softer and break apart more easily. They should be soft and firm in the end.I accidentally left them soaking for about 17 hours. Make sure to mind your schedule in terms of sleep, and other activities, unlike me!Fortunately, most of the beads seem completely fine, although just a few have softened and broken apart.Like I said, this isn&rsquo;t an exact science. Everyone&rsquo;s water chemical make-up is different, which can yield varying results.So next, I drained the water from the vase. I assume an actual strainer would work better than just using my hand. But I used my hand anyway. It won&rsquo;t work with kids&rsquo; tiny hands. The beads will fly everywhere. I mean that!!The beads are all smooth, wet and slippery, and that&rsquo;s normal. They ARE made up of water after all.These beads are gorgeous! Seriously beautiful, and so much fun to touch and play with. They were exactly what I expected, and even better.The color scheme is perfect, and this particular color set was chosen very well. All of the bright colors blend well with, and compliment each other. That&rsquo;s why I went with this specific Marvel Beads company. They didn&rsquo;t just have random colors in this package. They were chosen to highlight softer hues, than red, white, black and other darker, more opaque colors. These are all more upbeat spring colors, and they are vivid, happy and bright. I love the jellybean colored bright pink the most.But these shining beads truly belong together, so congrats to the person who made up this specific color grouping&hellip; It works!The beads appear like soft, glowing orbs, because of their translucency in the light. They can almost appear like the fiber-optic inspired man-made Cat&rsquo;s Eye.And I was right; there ARE more yellow beads than the rest. But it doesn&rsquo;t make a major difference because there is still a big variety of colors. There are soft to bright pink, light &amp; vivid purple, light to bright blue, turquoise, yellow, clear, light to bright green, orange, and slight variations of all those colors as well. Some appear lighter or brighter than others.Most of the water beads are similar in their round marble-like size and shape. There are also several larger beads and some are shaped irregularly, like eggs.There is more variety in shape and color than you may expect. But these differences are fairly subtle, so it wouldn&rsquo;t matter for any special occasion. I&rsquo;m an artist and designer, so I notice tiny differences that others may not notice.The beads feel very smooth and are totally unblemished. Their surface is firm but jiggly, and not easily torn apart during regular use.They&rsquo;re still fragile enough to not TRY to crush them under things, or with your fingers. If you want to experiment, go ahead. There are plenty of extra water beads left. Just make sure infants and animals don&rsquo;t get a hold of these, which is why I recommend adult supervision.When I reach my hand into the vase, some of the beads come flying out and bounce off the walls and other solid objects in their way. They are tremendously light and bouncy! So if many of them drop at once in a larger room, well&hellip; Good luck!During their wild travels, the moist beads can attract loose hair, dust and dirt, so just rinse them off for a few seconds, before putting them back with the rest.Currently, I&rsquo;ve just kept the water beads inside the glass vase to admire and periodically play with. They&rsquo;ve been on the bathroom counter for several days now, and everything seems fine. I just drained a tiny bit more of extra water from the bottom. My mom ended up asking me for some of the beads. She couldn&rsquo;t resist. Which is totally fine, because if a teaspoon makes this many water beads, wow. There are a LOT more left in this package!A LOT.The water beads are excellent sensory and play tools for kids, autistic/ill/blind/disabled children, adults, and anyone else. They are definitely distracting and amazing to touch.They feel really nice, soothing and relaxing when you handle them and and scoop them into your hands.They present a cool, slick jelly-like texture that our hands aren&rsquo;t used to feeling. For a child, these are so much fun to play with, and to share with friends.For others, these colorful water beads can be used in various, creative ways. Especially for big events, like parties and weddings, room decoration, and even a background for pictures!YOU CAN:1. Use colorful water beads to keep flowers and plants hydrated, without much maintenance. Rehydrate the beads with water about once a week, and that should be plenty. They will blow up to their regular size again after being soaked.2. Use these for decoration for various things, such as inside a clear flower vase, to keep even a single rose happy and surrounded by beauty. It really is beautiful!3. Use them to fill an open bowl, with floating wax candles on top. You can find them for cheap, at places like efavor.com. The site is a bit less sophisticated, but wow. Amazing sale prices, esp. For bulk items, floating flower and cactus candles, fabrics, party favors, ribbons, and affordable chandeliers to stand up or to hang. They sell everything for any crafter, artist or party designer. It&rsquo;s heavenly.4. Put Waterproof: Flameless, and color-changing candles or mini flashing lights on the bottom of a bowl to create a really cool ambience for a party. Steady white lights would show off individual colors very well.5. Use the beads as decoration in a clear container, under a food dish, or another type of artistic presentation. (Or any actual arts and crafts projects.)6. Put the beads inside small plastic balls with a hole for string, to create ornaments for a tree or for any room.7. Separate the beads by color, to create different colored themes for special occasions. You can even match the bead colors with similar color waterproof lights!8. Get small glass terrariums and put the beads in with plants, rocks, etc. to hang them from your ceiling. (There are pretty, affordable ones on Amazon. Some have small holes towards the top for real lit candles. A great idea for a get-together!)9. Put them into fish tanks for a beautiful, colorful environment.10. Keep pens, flowers, and other objects standing up, by sticking them in between the beads in a jar.These are just some suggestions that came to mind, to help jog your creative juices. Honestly, these water beads are just really cool on their own. They&rsquo;re visually stunning, aren&rsquo;t dirty or messy, they don&rsquo;t smell weird, and they&rsquo;re easy to maintain.For the cheap price, I doubt you would be disappointed in any way. The whole concept of these magic water beads is just genius, and I (almost) wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking a bath in them! (It&rsquo;s actually possible for a kid, I&rsquo;d imagine.)Me? I&rsquo;m not having any parties or special occasions. I just want to beautify my room, because I love bright colors and these beads are awesome.I would definitely order these again, but this pack alone has enough for decorating a big event. So I doubt I&rsquo;ll HAVE to buy more.Next, I can&rsquo;t wait to try those jumbo water beads. Those things look huuge!</p>

<p>These are SO AWESOME! I can&rsquo;t believe how big they&rsquo;ve grown already. I put them all in a big jar with water last night. They were all small at the bottom of the jar. I woke up to them all big and at the top of the jar. Now I need to find a big bowl for them. They are such pretty colors and so cool.</p>

<h5 id="glad-we-bought-them">Glad we bought them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beads soaked in distilled water for 3 days reached diameter of 2 inches or more. The grandkids were thrilled. They are more fragile than smaller beads, and began disintegrating after the kids began gently bouncing them on the table. They did tolerate handling well, however. Cannot be dried and reused. All split apart when left to dry. We crushed them and added to garden soil to improve water retention instead of throwing them away after use. Glad we bought them!</p>

<h5 id="son-loves-them">Son loves them!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Big hit with my seven-year-old, however do not try to bounce them they with splat. Don&rsquo;t try to squeeze them, they will squish. Takes three days to become completely expanded. Son loves them! They roll nicely lol</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-pretty-cool">They are pretty cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work.. They break easily thoug. Just dont play with them too much while they are growing and theyll hold better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bigger-is-not-always-better-sadly">Bigger is not always better, sadly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these because my children love the smaller water beads and I wanted to give them something new to try. Unfortunately we found out that bigger is not always better since these are so large that they break with minimal force. Since they break so easily the kids aren&rsquo;t able to play with them for longer than a couple minutes and I&rsquo;m also not able to save any for future activities. Will not buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-don-t-get-as-big-as-the-picture-suggested">They don&rsquo;t get as big as the picture suggested. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get as big as the picture suggested. I have used 4 so far, and 2 of them burst (one while still soaking, and the other right after being taken out).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fell apart within seconds of children touching them</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>The kids (and adults) are loving these!</p>

<h5 id="waste-of-money">WASTE of money !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>About <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> split in <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> after leaving them in water for only 6 hours. :( the rest broke into pieces after picking them up.</p>

<h5 id="broke-easily-with-too-much-manipulation">Broke easily with too much manipulation</h5>

<p>Purchased for therapeutic use in early intervention. Able to achieve learning experiences. Broke easily with too much manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-a-great-addition-to-your-sensory-table">they are a great addition to your sensory table</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are exactly as described. I purchased the larger beads because I was worried about my students placing them in their mouth.</p>

<h5 id="the-size-is-about-the-best-thing-about-it">The size is about the best thing about it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The size is about the best thing about it. However. Wherever it is you want it to grow. Leave it there. The second you touch it it starts to break up on you. Not worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="toc_17">💚💛💙💜</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids love them. Would buy them again. My kids enjoy watching them grow each day. And breaking them lol</p>
