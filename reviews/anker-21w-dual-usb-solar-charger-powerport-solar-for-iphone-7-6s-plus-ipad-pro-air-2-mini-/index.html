<h5 id="excellent-charger-but-anker-powercore-20100-battery-is-not-compatible">Excellent charger, but Anker PowerCore 20100 battery is NOT compatible.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wondered why my Anker PowerCore 20100 power bank would never charge from this solar charger, but would charge from a wall charger. So I performed some tests and found that if a cloud passes then the 20100 will drop to a trickle charge for the rest of the day. The 20100 dynamically reduces its charging current draw, but does not increase it.For example, if the sun is out the 20100 will charge at 2.0 Amps from this solar charger. If a cloud passes and the solar charger can only produce 0.25 Amps then the 20100 will reduce is current draw to 0.25 Amps (as it should). However when the sun comes back out the 20100 will still only draw 0.25 Amps, even though more than 2 Amps are available. This was verified using both the YZX Studio ZY1266 USB power monitor and the Drok Pocket Digital Multimeter.Anker support said the 20100 power bank was defective. I replaced it with a second one that behaved the same. I tested my older out of production Anker batteries: the Astro 3E also doesn&rsquo;t increase its charge rate, but the Gen 1 Astro E5 does. The E5 immediately responds when the sun comes back out and draws all available current from the solar charger. I again contacted Anker support and asked for a list of batteries that have been tested with and charge properly from the Anker solar charger. Anker could not produce anything so I was on my own.I purchased some other batteries to see what would work.The EasyAcc Monster 26000mAh Power Bank worked properly. Plus this battery has two charging ports so it can connect to both solar output ports and charge at greater than 2.0 Amps when enough sunlight is available.The Anker Astro E7 26800mah Power Bank works perfectly with the Anker solar charger.The RavPower 26800mah Power Bank works properly in almost all conditions with the Anker solar charger. However if the sunlight drops too low and the charger produces close to 0 ma, but then the sun comes out before the solar charger powers off, the RavPower would not charge anymore. None of the other batteries had this particular problem. I also have the ChoeTech 19W SunPower Solar Charger so I tried the RavPower with it and found that the ChoeTech will reset the USB connection within a few seconds of this happening. So the ChoeTech/RavPower combination works fine. But if you use the RavPower with the Anker solar charger you might come back to your battery at the end of the day to find it didn&rsquo;t charge.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m using this with an EasyAcc 26000mAh power brick.My first test of the panels was on a mostly cloudy day when my power brick was charged in the 26-50% range. It charged up to the 51-75% range after about 4 hours of indirect sunlight, using both cables.My second test was on a very sunny day. My pack was drained back down to the 26-50% range and was fully charged after about 4 hours in direct sunlight, using both cables.I do not recommend using the provided pouch on the panels to store your device, as the heat there can be excessive. Get some longer USB cables so that you can move your device away from the panels - they do get quite warm.I did not see the problem some people have talked about where the panels quit charging until unplugged and then plugged back in. On the mostly cloudy day, I did have a few short periods of direct sun mixed in with the clouds. I watched the charge light on the panels and it stayed red the entire time. My EasyAcc brick was receiving a charge the entire time.So far I am very pleased with this kit and would recommend for anyone who might want to dip their toe into solar power.UPDATE: I have been able to actually measure the power output of the panels now, with a Drok USB tester. As you can see in the photos, in direct sunlight I was getting 4.4 to 4.5 amps in direct sunlight, which is a bit higher output than advertised (21w/5v = 4.2 amps). A bit of shade drops the output down into the 2.5 to 3 amp range and complete overcast will produce from .5 to 1 amps. As expected the angle of the panels affected power output as well, with around 45 degrees to the current sun azimuth producing the highest output.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="a-comparative-practical-review-of-the-anker-21w-and-aukey-20w-portable-solar-usb-chargers">A Comparative Practical Review of the Anker 21W and Aukey 20W Portable Solar USB Chargers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> COMMON BASIS FOR TESTINGI recommend that you review the accompanying video first. I purchased the Anker PowerPort 21 watt and Aukey 20 watt portable solar chargers within the last week. Neither was provided in consideration for this review.The test was accomplished on a sunny nearly cloud free afternoon at about 1:30 p.m. Both three panel fold outs were arranged in nearly identical positions on a small table in my back yard. An inexpensive Drok LED USB tester was employed to measure output from both products.Both products utilize SunPower solar panels, reputed to support conversion efficiency up to 23.5%. Both also include controllers to allow for the fastest possible charging speed up to 2.4 amps to each of two USB ports. Both employ canvas fabric and Pet polymer faced panels with a water resistant design; water resistance was not tested on either unit.The 1 amp USB port was used on both products. Switching the meter to the other port did not produce additional power. The USB charging cable provided with the Anker product was used on both; a cable was not provided with the Aukey unit.QUANTITATIVE RESULTSAs shown in the video, the Aukey 20 watt product produced 5.15 volts at 0.51 amps for a total of 2.6265 watts. Power, measured in watts, is equal to voltage multiplied by amperage. While the output from one USB port should be substantially less than that from both combined, the substantially lower realized output is instructive. Both units consistently produced sufficient power to cause my 5 inch Android phone to reflect charging.The Anker 21 watt product produced 5.11 volts at 0.52 amps for a total of 2.6572 watts. Despite being rated at 21 versus 20 watts, both chargers supplied about the same power to the Smart phone. I strongly suspect that both the Anker and Aukey solar chargers would have charged at a much higher rate had something more than a 5&rdquo; Smart phone been used. In this regard, the same Smart phone only charged at 4.93 volts at 0.47 amps using the same Drok meter with a regulated power supply running at 13.8 volts into a vehicle USB charging port. That both the solar chargers charged the Smart phone at a greater rate than the regulated power supply would tend to validate the claim of both manufacturers that their solar chargers would charge at the fastest rate safely possible for a given device.PHYSICAL PRODUCT COMPARISON &amp; CONCLUSIONBoth products include metal clips and or fabric loops to allow easy attachment to backpacks or other objects. The Anker uses four metal eye holes whereas the Aukey has four fabric loops and a single metal eye hole. Both have comparably sized storage compartments and use Velcro to secure the foldout panels. Anker includes a red LED between the USB ports to signify charging. The Aukey additionally includes an attached rigid panel sized board for positioning of the panels.The power output is sufficiently close to nullify that as a serious consideration. Construction and components are also essentially the same. Both appear to be of Chinese design and manufacture.I believe both were worth more than what I paid for them, although the Aukey cost me $5 less. I did a fair amount of research prior to buying these products and believe both are deserving of excellent ratings. My technical video reviews routinely require at least a couple of hours to produce and I would appreciate a helpful rating if you found it so.POSTSCRIPTSince some of you might be interested in seeing how the Anker Solar Charger did under a greater load, I placed the panels on the same table about 1:15 p.m., again with a nearly cloudless sky; the temperature was again about 50 degrees. This time, I added a 20 amp NewNow S25 USB storage device to the 5&rdquo; Android phone. The storage unit is rated at 5 volts at 1.5 Amps input.With the panels laying flat on the table, the Drok meter registered 4.64 volts at 1.28 amps (5.9392 watts). By lifting the panels more toward the sun, the voltage rose to 4.98 volts and 2.19 amps (10.9062 watts). Only one of the USB ports on the charger was used. The Aukey charger was not tested, but since it employs the same brand, quantity and size panels, I have no reason to believe the results under a greater load would have been substantially different.POSTSCRIPT - STATING THE OBVIOUSWhile there is no simple answer to realized solar panel efficiency, suffice to say that you are much more likely to achieve good results in Arizona than in New England. That is, panels located closer to the equator on a sunny day have far greater potential for producing solar electricity than the same ones closer to the poles. This is a function of radiance, the single most important determinant in panel efficiency. Obviously, radiance is much better on a cloud free day than an overcast one. Just as obvious, panels are also much more efficient if pointed at the sun,For a much better understanding of solar panels, I suggest you consult UGov.Net, American Home Disaster Preparedness. Understandably, I&rsquo;m not paid to do this and the site is clearly a work in progress.READ MORE</p>
