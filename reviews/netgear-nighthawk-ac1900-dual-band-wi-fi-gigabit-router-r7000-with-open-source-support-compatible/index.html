<h5 id="quadrupled-my-speed">Quadrupled my speed ðŸ˜€</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quadrupled my speed at home. There are 4 important points I&rsquo;d like to make:1) All these years I paid for a 50mbps speed from my cable company. I had an older Netgear from 2009 which has served me well all these years (and still works) but I decided it was time to upgrade. Typically I was getting only 12-17mbps through my wi-fi (for example, to my iPhone6). After getting this Nighthawk Router, I now get 57mbps on the same iPhone. All of my devices are much faster now&hellip; PS4, iPhones, iPads, Epson Printer, Baby Monitor, Tablets, Roku 3 box, Roku Streaming Stick, etc&hellip;2) Cables &hellip;. Please note, one other thing I did in addition to getting this router is that I also bought all new cat6 cables (from Amazon Basics), and that has helped the router to connect well to the cable modem. From the router itself, I have a few wired items (Roku 3 box, PS4, my PC). And note that I tested the Roku 3 box, PS4, and PC wirelessly as well. In all conditions, wired with Cat6 cables and/or wi-fi, this Nighthawk router has delivered the speeds I was missing for years.3) Interface&hellip;. Also, I like the interface for setting up and using the router. I like that you get two options of 2.4ghz or 5ghz connection. One thing to keep in mind is that some older devices can only use 2.4g so it is that old device itself that limits the connection speed (not your wi-fi necessarily). Newer devices are 5g capable and can maximize the speed capability.4) Security&hellip; I also like the &ldquo;Access Control&rdquo; feature so that you have to permit a device to connect to your wi-fi. For example, when I got a new iPad this Christmas, I logged into my wi-fi network and put in the proper password, but it wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the internet. Then I went to the Netgear interface on my PC and it displayed that the iPad had been blocked (because Access Control is turned on). So then I simply hit a check box to &ldquo;allow&rdquo; the iPad onto my home network, and then it connected.Finally, I am not a tech person, I just try to read up on things to the best of my ability. I hope my review helps some of you.5 STARS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;tri-band&rdquo; router? In extremely rudimentary, lay terms, the Nighthawk has the strength of three routers. It can handle three times the number of connections a single-band router ever could (presumably), yet all the devices are able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; one another and play nice together. So, yeah, it&rsquo;s expensive. It&rsquo;s quite possible, in fact, that you don&rsquo;t really even need a tri-band router.And then there&rsquo;s us.I just walked through our apartment; between my husband and me, I count 25 web-enabled devices. That number doesn&rsquo;t include light bulbs. Most of these gadgets are connected to the Internet *at this moment.*Our friends make fun of us because we have totally embraced the concept of the &ldquo;Internet of Things.&rdquo; Besides the usual gadgets (iPads, phones, game consoles), we use a Nest thermostat, a Nest Cam, Philips Hue bulbs, an Amazon Echo on our kitchen countertop, and a Sonos.Far from automating our home, we&rsquo;ve instead created a TON of headaches for ourselves. We live in a waking nightmare. The &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; is here, and it&rsquo;s miserable.But by far the biggest hassle has been the simple fact that our trusty old Linksys router just could not handle the workload. When you have this many gadgets and gizmos connected to the &lsquo;net, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to bring the whole home infrastructure down. And when the wireless is down, there goes your fancy Sonos-equipped stereo, your home security, your thermostat.After a couple years of frustration, my husband and I agreed to go with a beefier router. At that point, we didn&rsquo;t care if we paid through the nose for one. Initially we went with a top pick from Wirecutter (which is a tech review site that is almost always right about everything). And, not to disparage Wirecutter here, but the router we ended up with was EVEN MORE MISERABLE. Maybe we just had too much stuff connected to it? We tweaked the router&rsquo;s settings, upgraded its firmware, downgraded it again, and ultimately returned it after maybe a weekâ€”and we rarely return anything, okay.Desperate, I took to the Internet for advice. About a jillion of my friends (all of whom work in tech) endorsed the Netgear Nighthawk without reservation. It was almost unanimous. A lot of folks were really passionate about this! So I overnighted one.Twenty-five devices connected simultaneously? No problem. In the month+ that we&rsquo;ve had a Nighthawk, it hasn&rsquo;t needed to be restarted once. It lives in a closet. I never look at it. I don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s here. I&rsquo;m sure the UI is terrible but I&rsquo;ve rarely needed to use it, since it worked out-of-the-box. We live in a city, halfway up a high-rise building, and we can still get a signal from downstairs on the street. Beat that.Sitting here, I just ran a speed test, and on my wireless connection I&rsquo;m getting 58.37 Mbps download speedsâ€”not too shabby, considering we pay for 50. (Never mind there are literally 200 other wireless routers in our building!) I barely remember that Netflix and Hulu used to stutter and stagger. Multiplayer gaming connections don&rsquo;t drop or lag. Great stuff.Anything more than $100 is a HUGE investment in a router, I feel; anything non-commercial over $200 is probably criminal. But the Netgear Nighthawk really works for us, especially when literally nothing else would do. For that alone, it&rsquo;s worth it.I hope I don&rsquo;t need to buy another router for many years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Decided to cut the Spectrum strings. I have been using a cable company provided router/modem combo for years. I hooked this router to SB6183 SURFboard modem and for the first few hours everything went as expected. At first, the signal strength across long distances was pretty amazing especially in the 2.4 GHZ band. After about 10-12 hours my PC upstairs started losing signal strength. A speedtest which initially showed 60 Mbps down and 15 Mbps up had fallen to approximately 20 down and 0 up&hellip; yes that&rsquo;s right ZERO. I did a soft reset on the router, rebooted the PC, tried another 2.4 GHZ device in the same location, but nothing fixed except a hard reset of the router by unplugging and re plugging. Everything was back to normal until the next day. Same thing again. During all of this, I could move my laptop near the router and all was well. Move it upstairs about 20 feet away and it would flake out. I started searching online and found several people with the same issue. The fix was to roll back to a much older firmware, reset the settings to factory default and then set everything up again. I did this about a week ago and everything has been perfect since! If you are thinking of purchasing this, please do an internet search for R7500v2 dropping wireless or R7500v2 losing wireless. The firmware that had the issue was Firmware Version 1.0.3.10 and Firmware Version 1.0.3.4. The firmware that fixed is Firmware Version 1.0.0.28. The router really is amazing with the older firmware. I am amazed at how far the signal carries.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> Update - Had interference issue. Had to set 2.4 GHZ band to channel 11.</p>
