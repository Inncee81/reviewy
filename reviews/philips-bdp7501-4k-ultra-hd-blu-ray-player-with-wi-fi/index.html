<h5 id="and-i-have-to-say-it-is-the-best-value-out-there-if-you-want-to-jump-into">and I have to say it is the best value out there if you want to jump into &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this player today, and I have to say it is the best value out there if you want to jump into 4k Blu-Ray at this point. The options out there are limited. The Xbox One S may be a good choice also, but I wanted a dedicated player. I already have a Playstation 4, and I just didn&rsquo;t want another video game system for my media room, and no, it wasn&rsquo;t because I am a Playstation fanboy. I wouldn&rsquo;t shell out for the upcoming Playstation Neo either. I guess I find that running movies on a game system, while they may play fine, I have found the controls are not as intuitive as a dedicated player. Enough of that though. Let&rsquo;s talk about this player. First thing I noticed is how solidly built it is. Compared to the Samsung Player, this player is much more substantial even though it is the most compact player available. The second thing I notice is how quiet it runs, and it loads discs quickly. The remote that is included is actually functional, not like the Samsung remote that makes it difficult to fast forward. Another plus is that Phillips actually gives you an HDMI cable. You would think this would be an automatic include, but someone should tell that to Samsung. They also give you a movie, Creed, and while it isn&rsquo;t a movie I would have purchased separately, at least Phillips was kind enough to give you something to watch out of the box. I will give it a view at some point, but the movie I tested this player with was The Martian. The colors and details are breathtaking on my 4K HDR Samsung JS9000. I can definitely tell a difference in color saturation with 4K. I think this player does every bit as good a job playing discs as any other 4K player out now. The Panasonic DMP-UB900 looks enticing with the exception of the price, and I don&rsquo;t doubt it may do a better job to some extent, but with the exception of a few, I don&rsquo;t know many people willing to part with almost $800 if you include tax on a player that will probably come down to a reasonable price in a few months. Face it, it is a Panasonic, not an Oppo. I own an Oppo BDP-103, and they are coming out with a player later this year. I am confident whatever they come out with will blow the Panasonic out of the water. It may be out of reach in terms of price initially, but if I am going to shell out some serious scratch on a high-end player, I want to be confident I am getting the best and not something that was rushed to market and will drop in price by more than half in a couple of months. I elected to get this player now to scratch the 4k itch, and I will get the Oppo later, maybe much later if it is much more than the Panny. Even then, I will keep this player as an alternate. It is solid enough that I know it will last. I have seen people complain the Phillips Player does not have Dolby Vision or more streaming apps. I would just like to say that even the $700 Panasonic doesn&rsquo;t have Dolby Vision, and most TV&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t even support it. With regard to the apps, I would just ask why did you buy a 4K player? It is intended to play discs. This player will at least stream Netflix and YouTube in HDR. That is more than I can say for Samsung. I have a smart 4K TV that can stream 4K content. What it can&rsquo;t do is play discs. One final thought. I know the manufacturers of these products want us to believe we have to have the latest and greatest to meet their bottom line, but I think 4K for home viewing is about the limit of what is perceptually better. I know they already have ventured into 8K, but unless you have an IMAX theater in your living room, you will never reap any benefit from that. I guess my point is that we can nit pick these products to death, but this Phillips Player is a respectable option for 4K movies. It may not be the most refined, but it is certainly in the realm of most affordable. I don&rsquo;t feel like I got ripped off, and for that I would like to say I respect Phillips for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the remote and graphics were better I would gladly give this fine product a 5 star rating. Looking at the Samsung 8500 it&rsquo;s remote is even worse so this seems to be the norm in this price range.The set up after updating the firmware was a snap but the graphics were pretty washed out and unimpressive however they were simple and easy to understand. I am using a 65&rdquo; Sony 900C 4K 3D LED TV, Marantz NR1506 AV Receiver with a ORB SS 8 speaker system with dual subwoofers so you know what my point of reference is when I talk about the video and audio performance of this player. With that said this player if I were to rate just video and audio alone is a 5. It has played everything I have tried to date effortlessly although total time to start a 4K DVD is on the slow side even with the energy saver system disabled. Doesn&rsquo;t bother me and unless you are into instant gratification you won&rsquo;t be bothered by it as well. I ended up using the auto everything run mode and think in my case it works perfectly. Sometime less is more. 4K disk performance is inconsistent so be advised. My first 4K DVD I played was Star Trek Beyond and to be frank I was not that impressed with the video ( but the sound was thrilling) as it did not look better then the some up scaled Blu Ray DVDs I have seen. But then I played Warcraft and wow the vedio matched the audio and it was a real treat. The mechanical functions of this player are solid and quite and makes me think this will be a reliable unit. Nice. Steaming worked flawlessly as I do not have the 4K option with my Netflix it was nice to see it streamed without it. Seemed to stream 4K on YouTube without a hitch. Regular DVDs looked very good with no artifacts and of course Blu Rays 2D and 3D DVDs looked excellent as one would have every reason to expect. Nice touch when playing non 4K DVDs is the ability to fine tune luminance and color as well as sound perimeters. Can help make older DVDs really come to life. Got to say again how fantastic this player reproduces movie sound tracks. Better than any player I have used to date.My biggest gripes with the remote are as follows:1. Lots of small buttons poorly identified.2. The master function control pad feels cheap and clicky when used. It compares badly when compared to a Roku for example when used for Netflix or YouTube scanning.To be fair if Philips was going to cut corners somewhere I guess this would be the best place because most of us will end up using a universal learning remote for the basic functions as I have.Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I recommend you consider buying one? You bet.2/17/17 undate:Found out that on my copy of Top Gun Blu Ray I had audio only when I tried to play some of the special features. This is one of my older Blu Ray DVDs so this may have something to do with it. No problems with 4K DVD special features and if I find a solution I will up date. Not a big deal for me but thought everyone should know. This could be a problem unique to my unit and I would not return it for repair for this reason I can get along without this feature just fine. Might even get fixed with the some future update as I suspect it&rsquo;s a software glitch. If this should be the case I will update again.</p>

<h5 id="i-ve-been-happy-with-this-one-so-far-as-it-came-with">I&rsquo;ve been happy with this one so far as it came with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased an LG OLED 4k set and decided to take the plunge on an Ultra-HD Blu-Ray player to go along with it. I&rsquo;ve been happy with this one so far as it came with a HDMI cable to go to my TV and I did have to supply a second HDMI cable (audio only) to go to my AV receiver to get surround sound audio as my receiver isn&rsquo;t compatible with the latest HDMI/Copy protection standards&hellip;so it&rsquo;s nice they though of this by having two HDMI outs on the player. However, by default it uses an alternate audio soundtrack for the HDMI audio out port which gets downmixed to plain old dolby digital or dts&hellip;you have to go into the menus and disable this feature to get the full 7.1 or better audio mixes. Why this isn&rsquo;t the default setting I don&rsquo;t know and I thought there was something wrong until I searched around enough to find this default needed to be changed.</p>
