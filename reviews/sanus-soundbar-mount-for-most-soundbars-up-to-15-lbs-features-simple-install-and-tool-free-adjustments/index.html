<h5 id="does-the-job-and-was-easy-to-install">Does the job and was easy to install.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installation was easy&hellip; I did NOT remove my TV from it&rsquo;s current wall mount (I just didn&rsquo;t want to mess with moving the whole TV).I removed one of the upper screws (near the top of the TV) attaching the wall mount to the TV, added a spacer from the soundbar mount and reinstalled the screw. Then I moved to the upper screw on the other side and added the spacer there and replaced the screw.Next I removed one of the lower screws that attached the TV to the wall mount and pushed the soundbar mount between the back of the TV and the wall mount. I lined up the screw with the hole on the soundbar mount I thought would work best and then replaced the screw. I then repeated the process on the other side&rsquo;s lower screw attachment making sure to attach the soundbar mount in the same hole on both sides.Next I attached the other pieces of the soundbar mount to the soundbar and then attached them to the pieces already mounted to the TV. I just had to do a little adjusting to get it evenly spaced (I did NOT have to remove the mount and put the screws into a different hole) and then tighten down all the screws. Works perfect!I have a 55&rdquo; Samsung TV and a Klipsch soundbar in case that helps anyone.UPDATED &ndash; well, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m just not strong enough to tighten bolts or what BUT the sound bar has shifted a little so I had to readjust it and tighten the screws down again&hellip; hope that doesn&rsquo;t happen again or I&rsquo;ll have to take my review down a star!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-with-minor-caveats">Works well, with minor caveats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works quite well. My one quibble is that it is hard to get it to start in the exact spot you want. You can tighten it down hard though and it stays pretty well. My one other suggestion is that if you plan to use it with the Sonos sound bar, spend the extra $40 and get the Sonos wall mounting plate too; we couldn&rsquo;t get this to feel secure on the sound bar without it, and had the sound bar fall off as we were adjusting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install. Comes with plenty of hardware for many different applications but&hellip;&hellip;. If you have a soundbar that does not have mounts on the back of it and are on the bottom like mine, you might have to get connected to your creative side to make it work since this kit was designed to hang soundbars that mount from the back. I have a Samsung soundbar that came with these L shaped brackets that screw to the bottom. Not a problem, at least it came with its own mounting hardware if you planned to mount it to the wall but if mounting to an aftermarket bracket like this one to hang from your TV, it makes it a little difficult because the mounting holes are very large. Nothing in the kit works without modification. I had to drill holes in the L brackets and bust out the Dremmel to make the oval shaped holes for the keyhole screws that came with the kit to fit in. I&rsquo;ll still give a 5 star rating because I believe Samsung is the one who made this project harder than it needed to be&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow-just-what-i-needed">Wow, just what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount is perfect for anyone who is like me and can&rsquo;t stand to see wires poking out from their wall mounted TV. It was VERY easy to install and came with plenty of hardware to make sure it will fit multiple vendors sound bars. The actual construction of the mount is much higher quality than I expected. I am very happy with this purchase and will be putting Sanus on top of my list for TV mounts in the future!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="soundbar-diffculties">soundbar diffculties</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the soundbar , but it really doesn&rsquo;t work very well with the samsung7500 curved soundbar even though it lists it as compatable, probably most of the actual problem is Samsung doesn&rsquo;t use a mounting system anything like the ones sanus showed on the instructions, I was able to get everything hooked up but probably with the modifications required it won&rsquo;t quite hold the weight (which is half what it&rsquo;s rated for) Again the mount is fantastic and would work perfect for any system like they show the three stars is because their site says they were compatable</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="installation-went-fine-the-only-possible-negative-side-of-this-mount">Installation went fine. The only possible negative side of this mount &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this to mount a Yamaha YAS-107BL soundbar to an 80-inch Sharp which was hanging on a wall in my office with a Chief mount. Installation went fine. The only possible negative side of this mount is that it seems i hit the limit. I have only approx <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; left of play until the soundbar mount is at maximum reach. I will be using one of these on another, older Sharp touch display and I&rsquo;m a little concerned it won&rsquo;t be long enough. Other than that, this thing did what it was designed to do. Installation was straightforward and all hardware is included. Product seems to be of a high quality. I will use this again if I decide to purchase additional soundbars for my office displays.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-getting-everything-installed-was-about-as-easy-as-it-could-be">but getting everything installed was about as easy as it could be</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very smooth and fast transaction. The mount kit is very well made, and has a large assortment of mounting hardware. It would be impossible for a manufacturer to anticipate every possible combination of TV/wall mount/soundbar, and I needed to purchase 4 metric nuts and nylon spacers for a few dollars to make this work, but getting everything installed was about as easy as it could be. It&rsquo;s working well, and we are enjoying our soundbar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="heavy-duty-metal-easy-to-adjust">Heavy duty metal. Easy to adjust.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sanus Soundbar Mount for Most Soundbars up to&hellip;PROS: Heavy duty metal. Easy to adjust. Includes several sizes of metric screws, washers. CONS: The long brackets can get in the way of the TV mount (65&rdquo; Samsung) limiting your placement and adjustment options (used with Costco SANUS Simplicity 37&rdquo; - 90&rdquo; Full-Motion TV Mount). The provided tightening knobs are plastic and give the impression they could strip or crack easily if overtightened.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-soundbar-mount-very-versatile-universal">Great Soundbar Mount! Very Versatile/Universal!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As always, this Sanus product worked perfectly! I will buy TV/soundbar mounts from no other manufacturer; Sanus is AAA.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best of the best. Great accommodation with the sanus tv mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-simple-to-install-and-i-did-not-even-need">Very simple to install and I did not even need &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very simple to install and I did not even need to remove the TV from mount or wall&hellip;.although admittedly, doing so would have saved me 10 minutes, HA!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="while-it-holds-my-speaker-bar-the-design-could">While it holds my speaker bar, the design could &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While it holds my speaker bar, the design could be improved. My speaker bar required the keyhole mounting and adjusting the fit to the keyhole so that any slight bump doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

<p>Really good item !!</p>

<h5 id="if-you-are-wall-mounting-a-tv-might-as-well-install-this-to-future-proof-your-mount">If you are wall mounting a TV might as well install this to future proof your mount.</h5>

<p>Works great and provides a nice clean install look.</p>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<p>it&rsquo;s ok. it works. but expensive</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="soundbar-hanger">Soundbar hanger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy install. Didn&rsquo;t even have to take the tv off. Works fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-review">My Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality is excellent but I give it only 4 stars because the 8mm x 40mm bolts supplied weren&rsquo;t long enough so I had to drive to an auto parts store to purchase some 8mm x 50mm&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This unit is easy to install and incredibly adaptible. Should fit your tv and soundbar.</p>
