<h5 id="worth-it">Worth it!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera was worth every penny. Gave us so many photos from our honeymoon that you just can&rsquo;t get from your phone. Compact, easy to use, and the remote worked great. Everything in a nice case. Works great with the phone app. Fun camera!</p>

<h5 id="5-stars-is-not-enough">**<strong><em>5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH</em></strong>**</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an AWESOME little camera with lots and lots of extras and options. 7+ mounts to attach to different things such as a boat, a bike, a helmet or hat, skateboards, deer stands and you can even wear it on your wrist.If you love outdoors this is for you. It also takes great shots inside as well. I love taking pictures of my grandkids and animals. It has a really nice waterproof case and they added an extra back door to the case for back up. I thought that was really nice. Another AWESOME thing is you get 2 batteries.The little carrying case is so neat you can pack all of your attachments up safely and have them ready to use as needed. It zips up really nice.It shoots a nice 4k video and saves to an SD card for easy transfer.You can connect it to WiFi and see it live from your phone or tablet by downloading an app called (Ez icam). You can start and stop videos or take pictures. There is also a remote available for that.I haven&rsquo;t been able to try it in the water yet but I plan to really soon. The good thing with Amazon is if your not satisfied you can return it with ease so you really have nothing to lose. I guarantee 100% you will love it. I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars it&rsquo;s just that GREAT!</p>

Pieced together with windows media maker (Premiere Pro kept crashing) - also realized i had all of the plastic still on it after i had already videoedpicture: 1080p30 with only the tv light on and a light in the kitchenMount: i used the handlebar mount (because we were supposed to try it on the motorcycle but weather and work conflicted) on my steering wheel. the mount was too small for my steering wheel so i just used a hair tie to tether it on tight and it worked perfectly.Fun Facts:- you can buy a 64 GB sd card like everyone suggests&hellip;.. but the camera will only read it as a 32. so yes it will work, just not the way you want it to. just as a heads up if you&rsquo;re reading other peoples reviews. also a class 4 will work if you want to just use it for photos or the lower res videos but it&rsquo;s not fast enough for the 4k. just kind of like playing a high pace video game on a not so advanced computer. just slower graphics.- time lapse is not a slowmo video. it&rsquo;s just a delayed picture taking.- when you video, it catches it in 5 minute intervals, so if you want to time lapse you will have to piece them together. and the screen with blacken to save battery life which kind of threw me off in the beginning cause i was like &ldquo;WHAT?!?!? it&rsquo;s broken already?!?&rdquo;- when screwing on the mounts, the two slot end goes in the three slots, and the screw goes into the thin side and the thick side should be used as a &ldquo;nut&rdquo; to your bolt. trust me, it will save you a lot of trouble and frustration if you do it that way.overall opinion: this is one of my best purchases. i was really looking for a gopro to take with me on some road trips i have planned soon, but i just didn&rsquo;t have the budget. i think they&rsquo;re highly overrated for their price but i just LOVE their versatility. this is the best camera i&rsquo;ve found so far! it is great quality and all of the mounts are compatible. i can take it underwater, wear it on the bike, strap it to my kayak. i love it! i&rsquo;ve already told everyone how great it is and how much i enjoy it.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-beyond-nice-it-met-every-expectation-i-had">it&rsquo;s beyond nice. It met every expectation I had</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received this product yesterday and I have to tell you, it&rsquo;s beyond nice. It met every expectation I had. Reading all the great reviews I was not concerned at all about purchasing this Action Camera. The 4K/2K quality videos are nice but for some reason I still prefer the 1080P qualities. Its a lot more smooth and fluid. This is a great alternate action camera if you don&rsquo;t want to spend those big bucks on those GoPro&rsquo;s. To me honestly, this is way better. You get tons of accessories and attachments along with an extra battery. If you want to go with something slightly better then ill say the GeekPro&rsquo;s. But if your using this just for generic use such as fishing, hiking, canoe rides, hunting, biking and just your everyday outdoor activities this will work just fine. I will attach some pictures and you can be the judge of it. =) the video quality on amazon is not very good so i deleted the video.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-action-camera">Love this Action Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this camera! It is absolutely amazing! It comes with everything you need. There are all kinds of attachments, so you can attach it to different things such as helmets. It captures beautiful photos and videos. My favorite part is the fact that it is waterproof. I am so ready to use it in the pool. I will be nice to be able to get pictures of my family having some summer fun. It comes in a convenient little case that holds everything. That makes it easier to travel with. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about losing any pieces. I like how it comes with a little remote so you can be in the pictures and videos. This camera was a steal for the price. I believe it is competitive with the gopro but for a cheaper price. I am so happy that I purchased this! I am definitely telling everyone I know about this amazing 4k sports action camera. I can&rsquo;t wait to continue using this for many years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just received it so learning how to use it. Too bad it didn&rsquo;t come with a memory chip. Also, didn&rsquo;t realize you need to use at least a 32G chip to use 4K.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-camera-for-a-great-price">Amazing camera for a great price.</h5>

<p>For the lower cost compared to the name brand camera, this thing is phenomenal. After the first day of use, it’s already equal or better than my GoPro Session.</p>
