<p>Product Description
Airsoft Electric Gun (AEG) 552 style. New generation Hop-Up Version Airsoft Electric Gun with Heavy Weight feel that makes it more realistic and sturdy.

<p>Amazon.com
A 1:1 scale replica of an SG 552-style AEG rifle, this Double Eagle airsoft rifle is remarkably authentic. The rifle fires round 6mm plastic pellets known as BBs, which are propelled out of the gun through an electric battery-powered motor. The advantage of the airsoft rifle, however, is that players can safely train, simulate, or play with the gun without fearing serious injury. The airsoft rifle looks, feels, weighs, and functions just like a real SG 552, but is built for casual recreation rather than weaponized use. In fact, the only way you can typically tell a real-steel firearm from an airsoft rifle is the blazing orange tip and the BBs that fire when you pull the trigger. The replica rifle offers such features as a ni-cad rechargeable battery; a selector switch for full auto or semi-auto settings; an adjustable red dot sight and flashlight; an adjustable hop-up system; and a foldable stock. This item is not for sale in some specific zip codes.</p>

The Appeal of Airsoft Guns
Due to the law and the cost, people cannot always own their dream guns. Airsoft guns, however, provide you with a realistic replica, allowing you to own a shooting (albeit nonlethal) version of that weapon. In fact, many of the weapons you often see in movies and TV shows are airsoft guns, thanks to the relatively cheap price tags and precise realism. The directors simply digitally alter the images to incorporate the muzzle flash, sound, and effects to mimic the real firearms. Generally speaking, most of the popular real-steel firearms have an airsoft counterpart, including the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 series, the venerable Heckler &amp; Koch G3 battle rifle series, Colt M16s, Steyr AUGs, SIG 550s, FAMAs, AK-47s, M60 machine guns, IMI Uzi and Ingram sub-machine guns, famed pistols like Barettas, Colts, SIGs, and Glocks, Benelli M2 and Remington 870 shotguns, and sniping rifles like the PSG-1, M40A1, and Blaser 93R. Even Hollywood guns like the RoboCop pistol and the M134 Vulcan&ndash;a six-barrel Gatling gun made famous by the Predator and Terminator movies&ndash;have airsoft counterparts.</p>

<p>The ability to own and play with your dream guns is appealing enough to many enthusiasts. The added advantage of taking these guns to a local playing field and &ldquo;shooting&rdquo; your best friends in a friendly competition is a hands-down selling point. There are countless clubs, teams, and organizations devoted to the sport of &ldquo;waging war&rdquo; with airsoft guns, known throughout the world as skirmishing. In essence, airsoft role-playing allows people to fulfill their fantasies, which (due to physical disabilities or circumstances) they never got the chance to do themselves. These people may be bankers, insurance brokers, secretaries, students, or computer programmers by profession, but for one day a week they can be Green Berets, assassins, SWAT members, Navy SEALs, or whatever else.</p>

<h5 id="love-it-just-love-it">Love it. Just love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I ordered this gun on the 17th and it got here yesterday which was a day later than the expected delivery date which kinda sucked but not a big deal. I opened the box, and fell in love with the gun. The plastic is very durable and I&rsquo;ve shot over 2,000 BB&rsquo;s since yesterday and it&rsquo;s yet to jam. Very reliable so far. Just some tips, first off, the scope and light are crap, don&rsquo;t expect much from the accessories. The mag holds about 25 rounds which isn&rsquo;t horrible but since it only comes with one mag you run out of ammo very quickly. Today I actually just placed an order for 5 more magazines for this gun. Don&rsquo;t use the silencer, it does nothing but make the bb&rsquo;s shoot up. I only use the foregrip on mine. The iron sights are alright, you can adjust them and whatnot but remember this is a CQB weapon, don&rsquo;t expect range. After about 20 feet the bb&rsquo;s start to drop fast, and I highly recommend using .20/.25 gram bb&rsquo;s with this weapon. At close range, it packs quite a punch, not so much beyond 20 feet. My friend and I have tested shooting eachother with it so I&rsquo;m not making that up. What else can I say, umm. Oh yeah the battery is amazing. It says to charge it for 3-4 hours, thats BS. I started charging it when I opened the box yesterday, I let it charge for about 45 minutes and then I went to my friends house to test it out. THE BATTERY STILL HASN&rsquo;T DIED. It&rsquo;s still going strong after over 2,000 rounds on a 45 minute charge. The gun is actually fairly heavy for plastic, the stock is very sturdy, in fact the whole gun feels great, it doesn&rsquo;t feel weak at all. Overall, with the only drawback being the low cap magazine, this gun is great. I can&rsquo;t wait for the other mags to come in! Then this will be great in an airsoft battle! Hope this review helped.</p>

<h5 id="great-gun">GREAT GUN</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEST GUN! This gun is really good for part time air softers I&rsquo;ve shot this gun 12 times and it shoots great. I recommend getting a least one extra mag but in all I give it 5 stars love this gun</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-beginner-gun">Very Nice beginner gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice assault rifle. Plastic feels like it is good quality, and I have had absolutely no problems.This gun is perfect for a beginner.NOTE: There are many reviews that say this gun shoots upward. I have noticed it is due to the muzzle being lower than the top ridge of the gun. It has nothing to do with its accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-a-bad-gun-but-the-directions-are-horrible">Not a bad gun but the directions are horrible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not a bad gun but the directions are horrible.also came with no batteries for the laser scope and no safety glasses that said were to come with the purchase. the retailer said they will send these things out so we will see. very hard to sight the gun in with no instructions,the bb&rsquo;s fly all over the place,too high,too low or left and right,cant seem to dial it in.also not that powerful, barely dented a pop from 10-15 feet.definitly a cool looking gun, just hope we get her to shoot straight and hope the laser works when we get the batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impressive">Impressive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this gun. Bought it for my son who is 9. It really won the best gift award! Powerful. Must use it outdoors in a safe area. Holds a charge for a long time</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="use-20-gram-bbs">Use .20 gram BBs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very solid gun for CQB. Don&rsquo;t use the suppressor! The FPS is low, but more than acceptable for CQB. This thing can be laser accurate at about 20-30 feet. The overall build quality seems durable enough, plus it came with a light, laser, and foregrip. I haven&rsquo;t had any feeding issues at all. I use .20 gram BBs and the gun is way more accurate, but you lose some FPS. Definitely the best $50 gun I&rsquo;ve ever purchased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-for-price">Awesome for price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfectly good gun. For the money. This is a solid gun for a few back yard wars, though definitely not anything more than that. It&rsquo;s got an OK build quality with the exception of the folding stock. I recommend supergluing the stock on rather than just leaving 4 tiny screws to hold it in.</p>

<h5 id="great-first-airsoft-gun">Great first Airsoft gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So, I started shopping for an Airsoft gun for my 11 year old son and came across this one. After carefully reading the different reviews I decided to give it a &ldquo;shot&rdquo;. I was very impressed when it arrived at how realistic it looked and the weight of the gun itself. Granted this is the first airsoft I have purchased but over all a very good product. <strong>The only thing I found as a design flaw is the way the scope turns on and off. If you don&rsquo;t make sure you grab the base of the on/off knob you actually take off the cap where the batteries for the scope belongs. I fixed this with a piece of electrical tape around the cap and base</strong>. Great first gun for a great price IMO&hellip;</p>
