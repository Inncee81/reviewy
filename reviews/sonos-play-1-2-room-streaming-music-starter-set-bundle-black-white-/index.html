Wonder where all that sound is coming from? The technical answer—from a pair of Class–D amplifiers and custom–built drivers, all meticulously tuned to the speaker’s unique acoustic architecture.</p>

<p>Power &amp; Networking</p>

<p>Power supply: Auto–switching 100–240 V, 50–60 Hz AC universal input.

<h5 id="love-them-but">Love them! But&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these speakers! I won&rsquo;t say the same things everyone has already said, but I will point out two limitations:(1) for this price point, they should also be Bluetooth capable because they do not play from the computer (i.e., no watching movies on the computer and playing through the speakers). This is a huge limitation and really it&rsquo;s quite surprising they don&rsquo;t just add his feature as it is inexpensive.(2) limited grouping options. You can play all speakers or just some speakers, but there should be groups you can preset and choose for that event or space without having to add and subtract each time you listen. For example, there should be an option to create &ldquo;upstairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;downstairs&rdquo; or &ldquo;party&rdquo; and &ldquo;TV only&rdquo;. You have to customize it each time. Lighting systems already do this and it&rsquo;s a simple fix but apparently customers have been complaining about this for two years and songs hasn&rsquo;t made a move to address this basic problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="expensive-but-worth-every-penny">Expensive, but worth every penny.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hands down the best speakers I&rsquo;ve ever owned. At this price tag you&rsquo;d expect a lot out of these tiny speakers, and trust me, you get a lot. You will be surprised when you first listen to them, I can almost guarantee it. The bass is astounding, and the music is so crisp and clear I find myself hearing new components to songs I&rsquo;ve listened to thousands of times. You&rsquo;ll also be amazed at just how loud these things get with no discernible distortion, and with two of them you can create a stereo pair for a truly unreal listening experience. They&rsquo;re controlled with an app you download on your smart phone, and as long as both the speakers and your phone can connect to the same wi-fi connection you can play individual songs, queue up songs in a playlist, or listen to internet radio stations from a good variety of supported apps such as Pandora, Spotify, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, and more. Each speaker can be set up to represent the different rooms you have them sitting in, and can even play two different souces of music at the same time in different rooms! An undersold feature is how portable they are as well. Unplugging them and plugging setting them up in a different room only takes the speaker about 20-30 seconds to reset and can then stream music again, and setting them up in the first place or in a new home is fast, simple, and easy. The software is constantly being updated (which at times can be a bit tiresome) and the app sometimes will desync and make you wait, but really these are tiny complaints for what you get.Yes, this is a lot of money to pay for two small speakers, but I&rsquo;ve never been happier with an electronics purchase in my life. I&rsquo;ve had them for a few years now and they sound and perform exactly as when I bought them. If you&rsquo;re looking for a home music streaming setup, look no further. These are the speakers to get.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-invention-ever">The best invention ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so I think Sonos are the best invention in the world. I have them in my office, my house and just added several to my beach house. Yes, they are expensive, but you are saving $50 by buying two at once and these are so worth it. The app is so easy to use and allows us to play different music in different rooms or all the same music which we do when we have guest. I have them in bathrooms, bedrooms, the kitchen&ndash;everywhere. Having the music follow you everywhere in the house is so luxurious. I even use them outside and protect them under faux boulders with holes drilled into the side. The stay dry and work perfectly. I&rsquo;ve been using these speakers since 2013 and recommend them to everyone. It is a great investment. Start with two and then people know what to get you for your birthday and xmas&ndash; additional speakers!They sound awesome BTW!!!! LOL</p>

<h5 id="great-system-but-with-one-big-caveat-on-placement">Great system, but with one big caveat on placement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first foray into the world of Sonos. I figured I&rsquo;d dip my toe into the water before diving in head-first because I&rsquo;ve heard really good things about Sonos in general, but they definitely aren&rsquo;t cheap. So, a pair of 1s seemed to be the way to go, especially with the $50 discount promotion they&rsquo;re running.Though these are the smallest of the Sonos line, I was surprised by their heft; they are quite solid, and not tiny by any means.Setup was incredibly simple, probably the simplest wireless devices I&rsquo;ve ever set up (with perhaps the Hue being on par). However, if you decide to move the speakers around, changing their location in the app is nearly impossible.The sound quality requires a big caveat. It&rsquo;s phenomenal if you place them in a corner. However, any other placement won&rsquo;t result in nearly as good of sound. First I put the pair in my kitchen, in corners on the countertop and set up as a stereo pair. It filled my large kitchen surprisingly well. I could only turn the volume up to about 10% before my wife said that was loud enough (though she has somewhat sensitive hearing). I can&rsquo;t ever really imagine needing to turn these up more than maybe 50% absolute max, even if you&rsquo;re throwing a really loud, crowded party.So next, I tried a single speaker in my office, which is probably the smallest room in my house at 12&rsquo;x10&rsquo;. Sitting it on my computer desk, the sound was&hellip; not nearly as impressive. Bass not nearly as rich, definitely sounded like it was coming from a single source and not as much of that room-filling largeness to it. The experience was so different I wondered if it was the lack of stereo, or the placement, so I put it in the corner to see how that affected it. It was a <em>huge</em> difference. The bass was again richer, and the sound once again filled the room.Moral of the story: with the Play:1s, definitely place them in a corner. It makes much bigger of a difference than you&rsquo;d think.The main downside of this system, to me, is that Sonos doesn&rsquo;t support AirPlay. So if you are on iOS that could be annoying. However, it does support tons of music streaming services through its native app (all the majors like Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and tons of smaller services too), so you can play just about anything you want. You can even queue up different songs from different services. And you can also control play/pause directly from a button on the speaker itself, even if your phone isn&rsquo;t around. I even tried turning off my phone, and it continued playing, so I&rsquo;m assuming it connects directly to these services and doesn&rsquo;t actually use your phone as a go-between.The Sonos app itself could be slightly more polished too. It was a little tricky even finding the shuffle option, plus the aforementioned issues moving around speakers, but it&rsquo;s pretty functional overall, and I imagine they will continue to improve it as time goes on.Overall I give it an <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. One point off for lack of AirPlay, which may or may not matter to you, and one point off for the cost (these definitely aren&rsquo;t cheap). But between the sound quality, ease of setup, and wireless nature (which I guess also falls under &ldquo;ease of setup&rdquo;), I do highly recommend Sonos as a great whole-home audio solution for anyone who has it in their budget (and doesn&rsquo;t already have a whole-home audio setup), and who doesn&rsquo;t want to run a bunch of speaker wire. I also recommend to anyone looking to replace/upgrade their current system.Assuming no deal breakers emerge, next I plan to get the bar, sub, and a pair of Play:3s as a 5.1 media center setup. I heard one of those (the 3) in an open-air market over Halloween weekend in New Orleans, and I was really impressed by how well it filled that space.</p>
