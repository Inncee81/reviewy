<h5 id="amazing-love-this-thing">Amazing! Love this thing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>assessment a great lawnmower. Has had it for 2-3 months and it has worked flawlessly. it doesn&rsquo;t bog down on you unless you try to cut it very short. I lived in Utah with her grass is more fine in this thing has no problem cutting through it. I usually leave that on level 5 which seems to have the best results. My lawn is a medium size, and I get about a 30- 40 minute run time with the battery. I pretty much only use one battery for my lawn. I haven&rsquo;t used the mulching function so I cannot review that, it bagged all my grass. The reason I thought this was lawnmower was because I have all the other Black and Decker lawn equipment and the batteries are interchangeable. This has also cut my mowing time in half because you can push is so fast because it literally weighs nothing. Let me know if you have questions about this thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-lawnmower-but-you-ll-need-more-batteries">Great Lawnmower but you&rsquo;ll need more batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, I love this lawnmower. It was a &ldquo;Lightening Deal&rdquo; which I bought for $227.00. It is light and a breeze to push. It&rsquo;s almost a identical twin to the more expensive CM2040. I went onto Black and Decker Service Net website and pulled up the parts list for both lawnmowers. The motor and controller have the same part numbers so the guts of the machine are identical but cosmetic parts are different. They provide two 2.0 ah batteries which is not enough to cut my 5000 sq ft property. Front and back takes me about 50 minutes. Lithium Ion batteries do not do well when overly discharged on a repeated basis so I tape a small timer to the switch and set it for 13 minutes for each battery for a total of 26 minutes. This drops the battery voltage to 35 volts from 41 volts. One LED is still lit.To extend my cutting time I bought two 2.5 ah batteries from Menards. They were on clearance for $68.00 each plus 11% rebate which brought it down to about $60.00 apiece. There may be still some batteries out there. I set the timer for 18 minutes for each battery. Since I have 4 batteries I can cut everything, front and back, with power to spare. I use the 2.5 ah to cut the back and the 2.0 ah to cut the front. One 2.0 ah battery is not used so I alternate the next time.Sharpen the blade. When I used the lawnmower out of the box, it bogged down in heavy grass. I have a thick Scott&rsquo;s lawn. After I sharpened and balanced the blade, it no longer struggles and saves battery power.I like the trickle charger so much I bought another new one for $20.00 on EBAY. I now can charge two batteries at once and have two batteries ready to go in about 3 hours. Remember, I only discharge the batteries to 35 volts as measured by my VOM meter so they don&rsquo;t take as long to re-charge.Cut your grass efficiently. If you take a lot of time making a turn at the end of row the motor is running but you are not cutting anything. This will eat into your battery big time. Don&rsquo;t walk fast, either. If you give the lawnmower more than it can mulch It&rsquo;ll take more out of your battery and actually decreases the runtime. Walk at a leisurely pace and let the lawnmower do the work.Lastly, the lawnmower is advertised as having a 20 inch deck. This is true. If you measure the underside it is 20 inches. However, it you measure the blade from tip to tip it is only 19 inches. So technically you&rsquo;re getting a 19 inch cutting swath, not 20. Also, the battery pack is made up of 10 cells, each cell is 3.6 volts (3.6 * 10 = 36 volts) so it&rsquo;s actually a 36 volt battery but charges to 41 volts.</p>

<h5 id="sleek-machine">Sleek Machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got my first house, bought this lawn mower, starts up so easily, cuts so quietly that me and my neighbor had a conversation and I didn&rsquo;t need to shut it off. It does kinda stink the 2 batteries that came with it only cut my front and side yard. So I cut the front and side yard and rest a day so they charge then do the backyard. I did buy 2 1.5 batteries, I was scared they wouldn&rsquo;t work for they are not 2.0 but the 1.5 fit and last just as long. I love mowing with such a sleek machine, and it cuts so smooth&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="would-have-loved-to-give-this-5-stars">Would have loved to give this 5 stars&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First time owner of a battery powered mower. I was just sick of pulling, gas, oil, spark plugs and tune ups every year. And the deafness that eventually occurs. It is very light and easy to push, pretty quiet, but you still have to push it. Coming off a self propelled Toro gasser which at over 80lbs is not easy, with all the turns etc. B&amp;D did a dumb thing with this model. They gave you a battery that is weaker and a lower rated charger than their orange model. You don&rsquo;t know that unless you look deep into the specs. The handle although it has three adjustment x 2 still does not go low enough for my ideal mowing height. The adjustment at the bottom of the handle has teeth so you may think it can go as low as you like. But they only give you three modes. High, higher and highest. I took the sprocket apart to find they put a block in so it will not go lower but it can be modified with a slight cut out then the handle will go down a few more inches. It mulches very well, but&hellip;the mulching block is not tight so the grass comes through the back of the machine. So another modification will be made to secure it in place without space in between. That could have been made to&rsquo;click&rsquo; into place but it just sort of lays there. The height adjustment works like a dream. No ball bearings in the wheels but they roll pretty good. One of the reasons I bought a B &amp; D was because I have a 20v trimmer, figuring I could swap batteries&hellip;.NOT&hellip; the 40v batteries cannot be used with a 20v machine and visa versa. My bad. So all in all I like the machine. Hopefully they will come out with a battery that will last a full hour and a machine that is self propelled. That would earn a 5 star rating.</p>

<h5 id="still-pending-final-review">Still pending final review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this mower because my brother-in-law has had one for maybe 10-15 years and loves it. I do like how simple it was for me to put together and even operate. However, the lithium batteries don&rsquo;t seem to last as long as it sounded they would in the reviews. They run down quickly if there is any length to the grass (even on the highest setting) and especially if it is damp at all. Granted we have had a lot of rain and I haven&rsquo;t had it long - I am hoping with more regular use, I will be able to re-review with higher marks! I do like how easy it is to adjust the height setting, the bag is easy to attach/detach, batteries easy to get in and out, etc.</p>

<p>Absolutely amazing. Works better than a corded or gas powered mower. Lasts longer than it takes to do yard twice.</p>

<h5 id="electric-mower">Electric Mower</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good mower, quiet and efficient, easy adjustable mowing height, handle height, and extension. But the charger that it comes with for the batteries is next to useless. If you go for an electric mower, this is easily one of the best i have ever used but buy the fast charger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk">JUNK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a small lawn. In the summer, I don&rsquo;t even need to mow weekly. The lawnmower worked for the first few weeks. After less than three months, it will not start.</p>
