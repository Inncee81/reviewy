<h5 id="arrived-with-bad-battery-and-not-functional-advanced-replacement-has-worked-well-for-months-now-so-upgraded-to-4-stars">Arrived with bad battery and not functional - Advanced replacement has worked well for months now so upgraded to 4 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>See udate:After receiving this refurbished nuvi 2597 I opened the box removed the product. Then went to plug it into the computer and found that it comes with like a 16 inch usb cable. Fortunately I have an extension. So I plugged it into my pc with 16 MB high speed cable internet. It took nearly 3 hrs to download the map updates because the unit keep restarting. After downloading maps and attempting to transfer my saved favorites from an old c580 unit. Garmin express stated the transfer was complete but afterwards they were nowhere to be found on this new unit. I then attempted to adjust various settings and the screen would flash to angled hyphens with a blue background and restart. Tried to pair the phone with the Bluetooth same thing. Totally unreliable. Refurbished apparently means they plug it in and it powered up so it was certifiable&rdquo;working as new.&ldquo;. It did come with a protective screen cover sad was wiped clean but totally none functional. Contacted Amazon and they immediately created an advanced replacement order but I don&rsquo;t have very high expectations. They are giving me a month to return this unit. No doubt to “refurb&rdquo; it again and sell it to another sucker. If you can afford the extra $30 get the new one. This is not worth the aggravation. If the replacement is also a dud that&rsquo;s my plan&hellip;Garmin&rsquo;s re-certification process is horse hockey..A.K.A. BS.Amazon shipped an advanced replacement in short order which arrived in seemingly good shape. It updated in under a hour and took a charge with no problem. This second unit appears to work well thus far. Voice commands do work and Bluetooth synced up with my tracfone and works well. So far so good on the replacement unit. Updating to 4 stars. actually pretty happy with this</p>

<h5 id="can-be-better-but-best-in-sub-150-category">Can be better&hellip; But best in sub 150$ category</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was using Nuvi 50 which did not have lifetime map update. Instead of updating the map, i went ahead and bought this item. Since it has 1 year warranty, i opted for refurbished one.I have been using this for the last 2 days.What i like?1) I liked the up ahead navigation where all the restaurants, banks are listed along with direction. It will be very useful when driving in free way2) So far i could not test the traffic. I got message like no traffic alert as i was driving on a town road.3) 5 inch display is definitely better especially when we are used larger screen size smartphones4) Basic clutter free Garmin navigation. No body can beat this.5) No bad surprises so far. Will update my review after a month&rsquo;s usage6) Clear visibility using sunglasses.7) Turn by Turn navigation with street names8) Can search the destination address using smartphone link app and sent to GPS by blue tooth. Awesome feature instead of typing the address in GPSWhat i don&rsquo;t like:1) Display is of low resolution. Probably a newer version might have better display.2) When not given the destination and drive using the GPS map view, my previous GPS used to tell the speed limit which was really useful. 2597 does not show the speed limit3) Very long initial setup. Have to spend close to 2 hours updating the software and maps which is painful before using it for the first time.</p>

<h5 id="user-friendly-and-free-lifetime-maps">User-friendly and FREE Lifetime Maps!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband travels for work and needed a reliable GPS to get him around different states and cities. We previously used the GPS on our Smart Phones when traveling for vacation or work. We got in a bind a few times with our phones losing signal and us having no idea where to go next. We researched several GPS&rsquo;s over the last couple of months and finally decided on this one. The biggest selling feature for us was the FREE Lifetime Maps. Who wants to spend $100 on a GPS and then a year or two later another $100 on map updates, not us! We loved that this should be a one-time purchase.Since having and using this GPS for a little over a month we have a new favorite feature&hellip; The Voice Command! This is seriously the best thing ever! It is super easy to use and you do not even have to look away from the road to tell the GPS where to direct you. We have used this all over the East Coast with no issues. The first couple of times I would use the Google Map feature on my phone in addition to the Garmin but I have since stopped as it has not yet took us an odd route.Another bonus feature is the ability to find things around you such as food and gas stations. There is another cool feature of parking. We have not tried out this one yet but it will be super helpful when we travel to D.C. next month.The Garmin comes with the actual GPS, a suction cup mount, charging cord and instructions. This is so easy to set-up I am not even sure the instructions are needed.We LOVE this GPS and would highly recommend it to others. This is our 2nd GPS and it is far superior to our previous one that we ended up tossing as being unreliable and not user-friendly!</p>
