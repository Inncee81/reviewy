<p>Dome Home Security Siren Dome now officially Works with Wink! Release the power of your Z-Wave home security system with a siren that firmly reminds you something’s amiss or blares when trouble’s coming. The Dome Home Automation Wireless Z-Wave Battery Powered Home Security Siren works with your other security hub’s components to alert you when a door is ajar, there’s someone on your property or you have a home invasion. No need to look at your phone to know when it’s time to take action. Hear the signal and heed the call. The Dome Home Automation Battery-Powered Siren updates you with your choice of three volume levels and you can choose specific chimes for various notifications. Configure your siren to quietly let you know when your teen has left the building or has returned. Make sure you’re alerted if your bedroom window is opened at night.

Install it easily without wires, anywhere, and its low footprint renders it almost invisible. Use with most any Z-Wave Hub including: Wink, Home Seer, SmartThings, Vera, Harmony and more. Secondary Chimes, volume control and advance configuration settings my not be available through all smart Hubs. Visit Dome&rsquo;s How-to page for more information</p>

<h5 id="works-well-not-super-user-friendly-and-is-a-little-overpriced">Works well, not super user friendly, and is a little overpriced</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for use with a Vera controller in a family member&rsquo;s house. The advantage is the ten chime settings that allow you to use as a door chime. Part of what was desired was a chime like traditional wired alarms so that there would be an audible alert when a door in the house is opened. For some reason this is the only product that i could find that does this. The tones are pretty weak in terms of appeal to me. There are two out of the ten that work for a chime, although one of those is really just a doorbell sound. I configured it for the single beep when a door is opened. It is pretty reliable as far as i can tell. The delay is very slight&hellip; about the time the door is opened 30 - 45 degrees the chime beeps. That&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable for me. There are three volume settings but i have yet to see how to adjust those without LUA code. For Vera there is a plug-in that makes selecting the tones easy via the GUI rather than having to write that stupid LUA code to call the function. Dome&rsquo;s website has how-tos on triggering the chimes via LUA code, but i didn&rsquo;t have any luck getting one of those to run. The plug-in is pretty stupid in my opinion as it doesn&rsquo;t seem to provide any useful feedback to let you know the chime is actually configured. It makes a second dome siren in your devices, so look for that. The second one created will have buttons to select tone chimes by clicking a button instead of writing a LUA function. It would be really nice if Dome made these a) without the useless LED, b) with better options for chime tones that don&rsquo;t require an expert to program them into the device c) for less than $50, and d) make an outdoor version. The price seems ludicrous for just being a &ldquo;beeper&rdquo;. The build quality seems good so i would definitely say it&rsquo;s not a cheap-o z-wave device.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="awesome-with-the-custom-smartthings-device-code">Awesome with the Custom SmartThings Device Code</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has many many more options than similar products on the market for zwave and smart things. I would highly recommend finding the alternate device code online and using that instead of the default device that comes with smart things network. The alternate device is available for free as a github download and you simply have to get on your computer access your home in smart things, find this device and copy paste the code into the device and you&rsquo;re done. The altered code lets you change volume and ring tone of the alarm &ndash; which is great. I live in an apartment, I do not need high heavens to hear the alarm. Just enough ruckus to stop the intruder which in most cases is the apt complex trying to enter to fix things and lately they have been bad about letting me know. Very satisfied with the product but like I said, get the custom device code first. You will thank me.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="best-siren-for-my-smartthings">Best Siren for my Smartthings</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros1. Integration with SmartThings2. Loud enough for my small apartment.3. Cordless - I am renting, so did not want to alter any wiring and take with me without digging the wall.4. Right now I am using inside my apartment for different types of alerts, like when the door is opened I set bell tone. when I leave the door open when I set the night mode I set another tone and for intruder alert I can set as loud siren, etc which give me lots of flexibility to use the same siren for multiple purpose.5. Since this is wireless , when I am out for vacation, I can hide or place this outside in my balcony.Cons1. Not water proof, but this is not a deal breaker.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-great-with-wink-hub-2">Works GREAT with Wink Hub 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This siren works well with the Wink Hud 2. So far it is the only siren I have found that can also play notification chimes and is adjustable. Although it is loud, it is not as loud as the GiControl siren. Because it is so small, you can easily incorporate multiple sirens throughout your home to scare an intruder, wake you throughout an emergency, or provide a soft chime when a door is opened. I love this siren and will be buying more to add to my smartphone setup.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-very-well-but-not-very-noisy-you-need-multiple-or-other-sirens">Works very well, but not very noisy. You need multiple or other sirens.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:It&rsquo;s battery operated, small, works well, uses Z-Wave Plus (backward with older Z-Wave devices and controllers too).Cons:It&rsquo;s not noisy. You hear it, but that will not scare a burglar like some other sirens do.Overall, I might still buy another one as more = better noise-wise, for areas where I don&rsquo;t have a way to keep a siren plugged-in.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-works-although">it works although</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The alarm does work.. the negative is that it has to be close to the base of the Samsung modem for it to work properly ..I have it outside it&rsquo;s on the other side of the wall maybe a difference of 3 ft it&rsquo;s not wifi-connected So it&rsquo;s not connected to my WiFi extenders that&rsquo;s too bad cuz I would have liked it ,near the door or windowREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-well-with-universal-devices-isy994izw">Works well with Universal Devices ISY994iZW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well with Universal Devices ISY994iZW. No problem joining, setting volume and chime. Lowest volume is good (a lower volume setting would be nice, but the lowest available is not too loud) for a chime; I am not using this for an alarm. Being battery operated is an advantage for me, I plan to put it in a zip lock baggy and take it outside when I need to be able to hear the chime.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just installed this with my existing Vera system and it went very smoothly and is exactly what I wanted.</p>

<h5 id="too-unreliable">Too unreliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After using this for 2.5 months or so, I have to conclude that it is just way too unreliable. I am using it with Smart Things and the official Smart Things device handler.</p>
