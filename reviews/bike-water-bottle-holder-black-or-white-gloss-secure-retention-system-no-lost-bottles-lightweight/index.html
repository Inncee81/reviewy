<h5 id="bike-water-bottle-cage-by-pro-bike-tool-was-easy-to-install">&hellip; Bike Water Bottle Cage by PRO BIKE TOOL was easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bike Water Bottle Cage by PRO BIKE TOOL was easy to install, easy to use, and appears to be great quality. It&rsquo;s not too heavy and would compare to the high end bike cages sold out in the market place. The OEM supplied the Stainless Screws with the cage, which nowadays is rare and nice to see. The Cage comes in a well presented factory packaging if you were passing the cage as a gift. The PRO BIKE TOOL cage does hold my bottle well. I&rsquo;m a MTB and had it on the single track trails two days ago, three wrecks, and the cage held the bottle on strong. I would purchase this PRO BIKE TOOL cage again if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-superior-quality-water-bottle-holder-for-bicycle-enthusiasts">A Superior Quality Water Bottle Holder for Bicycle Enthusiasts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pro Bike Tool Water Bottle Holder is impressive because of it&rsquo;s light weight, beautiful design and solid one-piece aluminum construction. I really like the flawless machine work and smooth powder coat finish, plus easy two-screw installation. This holder keeps my Camel Bak Water Bottle (and other standard size bottles) firmly in place while riding the roughest outdoor bike trails. Plastic bottle holders simply cannot compare to this high quality bicycle accessory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-so-far">Awesome so far!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this cage prior to the estimate, it came packaged with another item, perfect. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how lite it is. The fit up was perfect. It took a whole 5 minutes, including tool roundup to install. I was concerned about bottle fit, it did fit the larger size bottle, and seem to spring right back into original shape after my first ride with it. The other thing that is nice is the bottle fits snug enough on a single track ride, but you don&rsquo;t have trouble get your bottle out quick and easy when you want it. It always bothered me when I would have to grab and yank from my old cage. I especially liked the follow-up from Pro Bike Tool they emailed me to ask what I thought of this product. I like when a company takes pride in what they do. Time will tell how this cage holds up, but as for now, I think it&rsquo;s a great item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-company">Great Company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy with my purchase. I use camelbak water bottles and an &ldquo;Elite Byasi&rdquo; water bottle/tool holder pod; this holds all of them very securely. I purchased a pump and multitool from Pro Bike Tool as well, and I must say, I am very happy with all of their products. They are very well built.The company obviously takes great pride in their products, I have received emails from them ensuring that I am happy with what I&rsquo;ve purchased. I&rsquo;m honestly very impressed.I don&rsquo;t usually write reviews like this, but I highly recommend all of Pro Bike Tool&rsquo;s products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-and-company">Great product and company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently got a new bike and was astounded by the things bikes don&rsquo;t come with anymore (water bottle cage, kickstand, etc) so I set out to find the perfect one. Most are pretty boring. This one happens to be sleek and stylish. The design is functional, but it looks good too. I know that sounds silly for such a simple thing, but it makes a difference. It&rsquo;s a good design and it&rsquo;s well made.I also want to mention that the company, Pro Bike Tools, is great. They immediately reached out to me to see how I liked the product, ask for any questions/concerns and give me installation instructions. I would recommend this to others. Works great with my 20 oz. Polar bottle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-piece-of-equipment">Great Piece of Equipment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is a substantial piece of equipment. It feels strong, looks sleek, installed in seconds and works exactly as promised. The seller contacted me not once, but twice, to make sure I had all installation details (not difficult), and to welcome me to their family of customers. It was a nice touch. Glad I made this purchase.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="premium-bike-water-bottle-holder">Premium Bike Water Bottle Holder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a high quality and light weight water bottle holder. It has a stylish design and high quality paint. It is well worth the extra few dollars compared to the others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-are-a-great-product-they-are-very-durable">and are a great product. They are very durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered 2 water bottle cages from this company. They arrived on time, and are a great product. They are very durable, and the water bottles that I ordered for me and my son fit in them perfectly. I also received an email from Mike, who is with Pro Bike Tool to check and make sure my order was correct, and to see if I was happy with their product. I told him I am very happy. I will order all my future bike accessories from them. Follow up after the purchase is key to me. Thanks again Mike. I appreciate your great product and customer service.Dean</p>
