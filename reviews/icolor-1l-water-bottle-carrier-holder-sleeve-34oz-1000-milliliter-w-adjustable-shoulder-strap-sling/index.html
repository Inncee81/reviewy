<h5 id="a-fantastic-option-for-carrying-water-with-you">A Fantastic Option for Carrying Water with You!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 3 of these for my kids to take on hiking field trips and they&rsquo;re pretty awesome! My kids are completely in love with the vivid pictures on the outside and so are their friends. I fill the water bottles half full, freeze them, and then fill them the rest of the way before putting them in these holders and my kids have shown me that there is still ice in the bottle even after 9-10 hours! (Granted, they aren&rsquo;t sitting in the sun all of those 9 hours, but that&rsquo;s still pretty amazing!) The only reason I couldn&rsquo;t give these holders 5 stars is due to the fact that the ONLY bottle of water I could find that would fit in them was Smart Water (the one liter size). We will buy our kids reusable bottles soon, but we haven&rsquo;t yet and had to buy plastic ones. I took one of the holders to the grocery store with me and tried several brands. None of them would fit into the opening except the Smart Water- and I prefer water without so many additives. But, as I can still reuse the bottle once the water is gone, it all works out in the end and I will buy more of these in the future!</p>

<h5 id="love-our-glass-water-bottles">Love our glass water bottles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have Camelbak and Life Factory bottles for our kids. I was reeeeeeeeeeeally hoping to be able to put the glass bottles, while still encased in the silicone sleeves for extra drop protection, into the neoprene sleeve. Love our glass water bottles, but the lack of a shoulder strap for carrying isn&rsquo;t terrific. The kids LOVED the designs of these neoprene sleeves and are really excited about using them, so I have pulled the silicone sleeves off of the bottles and put the glass bottles alone into the neoprene sleeve&hellip;. and am keeping my fingers crossed. I probably could have forced the bottles in the silicone sleeves into neoprene, but it would be a pain in the neck to do that each time in order to wash the bottles of kid grime. If these were just a smidge bigger, they&rsquo;d be perfect for us. If having the extra silicone layer doesn&rsquo;t matter much to you, these little carrying cases are really cute :)</p>

<h5 id="i-love-it">I LOVE IT.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an vacuum insolated stainless steel water bottle and I have this HOT SPORT bottle insulator around it so I get triple insulation it is 10 inches tall and great we have poison water here and all over Montana (they make their own chlorine from powered pool chlorine and inject it into the wells here) not advisable for any one on this earth so I have reusable ice cubes I freeze them and then go to my favorite restaurant or other and have a cold drink or a coke. I close the top and I can use the other haff of the ice for a second cold drink so that is why I need triple insulation. I LOVE IT.</p>

<h5 id="keeps-water-cold-longer-convenient-way-to-carry-water-bottle">Keeps water cold longer &amp; convenient way to carry water bottle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this to take on our Caribbean cruise. Sadly Hurricane Irma sent us to Canada instead, but we still found this to be a convenient way to carry our (Contigo 32 oz) water bottle while on excursions. It is taller than the bottle, but we didn&rsquo;t find that to be an issue. We also used this while out running errands this summer and found that it definitely kept water cold longer. It also (snugly) fits the 50 oz water bottles available on Carnival cruises.</p>

<h5 id="which-fits-fine-i-measured-the-two-together-and-found-they">which fits fine. I measured the two together and found they &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this 1000L bottle carrier to use with a 32oz bottle I bought. It just came today. When I tried to put the bottle in the carrier, it wouldn&rsquo;t fit. I had bought same brand 750L bottle carrier about 2 months ago for a 24oz bottle, which fits fine. I measured the two together and found they were the same size, the newer one just wee bit smaller. Now I am wondering if I bought 2 750L carriers or 2 1000L carriers. Will keep the one I just received but may try to order another brand of 1000L carrier.</p>

<p>bought for my son for camp- he hasn&rsquo;t lost it yet (shows he really likes it) and the new isn&rsquo;t even worn off.It&rsquo;s currently being used at camp 2 this week.I recommend these for kids (and adults)we do wish there had been more design selection- but that isn&rsquo;t a product problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="extremely-useful">Extremely Useful&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reordered a few of these products and love them for their functionality, they are amazing at keeping my ice water icy cold almost all day. And the fact that I can leave it on my desk without it sweating is perfect. My biggest problem is that with the three I&rsquo;ve ordered over the months - each one is sized a little differently. There is a slight size different to all of them and it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to put some of the covers on my bottle. When I reorder (different colors/patterns), I can&rsquo;t gauge that there will be a slight change in size. Otherwise I would give this product a 5 star rating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my Swig Savvy bottle and it works great. I like the carrier that came with the bottle, but with the carry strap attached at the top and bottom of the bag, it tilts when I carry it on my shoulder and there is sometimes leakage at the top. This bad is the perfect size</p>
