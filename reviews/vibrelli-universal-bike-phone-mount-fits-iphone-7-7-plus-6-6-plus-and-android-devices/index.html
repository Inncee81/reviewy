<h5 id="rock-solid">Rock Solid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a big, and expensive, Note 4. I wanted to use it on my ride but I&rsquo;m scared to death of it failing off.The fact product has the mount and the rubber securing it made me take a chance on it. I love it! The phone doesn&rsquo;t move at all. I&rsquo;m a happy camper now as I can play my music through my bluetooth headphones and I don&rsquo;t lose the connection.Update (9/5/16): I&rsquo;ve now bought a second one for my Elliptigo Bike. That bike is a firm ride and if you&rsquo;ve ever been on San Diego streets you know how horrible they are. Again, Rock Solid. Love it.</p>

<h5 id="very-thought-out-product-great-affordable-option">Very thought out product, great affordable option</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first I was worried about how much of the product was plastic and durability issues but this far there have been no visible cracks or breaks. It isn&rsquo;t really designed for skinner handle bars like on hondas ( I have a cb500f) but lucky they provide 3 rubber filler strips I sandwiched together to get a snug fit onto the handle bars. Installation was quick and under 4 mins I literally was able to do it in the middle of the night outside my garage. Holds the phone securely and the rubber net is a nice fail safe if a bump or drop does jar the holder loose. Took this up to 74 mph on a naked bike on a windy day and it stayed in place with no repositioning. It is sensitive to harder knocks like if your arm hits or leans up against the mount while you dismount you bike but for the price it does everything a $50 + mount can. Btw I use a iphone 7 with a thick UAG trooper case and that pushes the expandable limits of the mount by at least 85-90 % and the rubber net by at least 90% to help people guage what size phones can fit.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-very-secure-some-functionailty-interference-on-the-s4">Easy to install, Very secure, Some functionailty interference on the S4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very skeptical of mounting my phone to my bike when my girlfriend first suggested it. We looked at several options and they all seemed to rely on plastic frames and various friction/grip spring loaded claws. I bike 8 miles to work, roundtrip, daily and often through busy traffic. I never know when I will have to brake hard or swerve and the concept of putting my smartphone on my handles, where the most jerking might occur made me very uneasy. I especially liked the idea of silicone band enhanced mounts that added that extra shock absorbing embrace of security when riding.*The product says, on the packaging, &lsquo;to fit any smartphone&rsquo;- which seems to be a bit of a stretch (pun intended) of the truth. While 3 grip bands are included and one could use two bands to secure the top and bottom of one&rsquo;s phone separately, I would not put my Phablet style (Note) phone in here. The spring loaded grip is VERY tight, which is a great thing, as I feel confident it could hold my phone in place alone, without the silicone netting, but doesn&rsquo;t expand much more than 4&rdquo;, making it a tight fit for larger phones. This being said, I think this mount would work best with most iPhones, and second best with Windows and Android smartphones such as the Lumia and Galaxy models. My Samsung Galaxy S4 is shown and fits snug. You&rsquo;ll note the Apple phone shown in the product images has more grip room on the corners because it is a smaller footprint. Take in mind most protective phone cases you&rsquo;d want on your phone while biking add a considerable amount of bulk.*This mount was easy to install and did only take a few minutes. We didn&rsquo;t care much for the &lsquo;adjustable&rsquo; method of sizing the frame grip by adding layers of included silicone grips. It works, but it required some cutting/trimming, and seems like the grip should telescope much smaller and simply require less tightening for larger framed bikes.*The phone mount itself snaps into a 360 pivot joint that allows viewing from nearly any angle- which is great when you&rsquo;re out biking in the sun and need to adjust for glare. I suggest investing in a glass screen protector with glare protection if you intend on using this mount, or any mount for regular navigation. I primarily use mine for Bluetooth purposes to screen calls to and from work, and listen to the radio.*This product advertises full phone access- again, I don&rsquo;t quite now how they can claim that for EVERY phone, but on our Galaxy S4 we are able to easily position the expandable clam-shell grips so that they do not interfere with volume buttons. This being said the silicone grip frame DOES cover our touch home and menu buttons. (See photo)In all, my phone feels very secure and I bike confidently with this mount. I have yet to notice any weakening in the pivot joint and the elasticity of the web band. The company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee, so if you&rsquo;re in the fence about the FIT of the mount and your device (as case thicknesses and such vary,) it&rsquo;s worth a chance in our opinion. Our only real gripe with our unique experiences is the fact that the webbing DOES go over and interfere with our menu and home buttons on the S4. This is to be expected with the design- but contrary to the marketing of the product. We received a discount in hopes we would share our honest thoughts, which I have provided here. Please feel free to drop any questions about our experiences or the mount&rsquo;s performance, we&rsquo;d be happy to assist.</p>

<h5 id="great-motorcycle-phone-mount">Great motorcycle phone mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mounted quickly, and feels sturdy. I have only been on 1 ride so far (60 miles round trip), but my phone was secure the whole time.<em>update</em> 01NOV Been out 14 times since installing, mount is still great. Feels solid on the motorcycle and my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge +) feels solid in the mount. I would definitely buy this again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-that-great-somewhat-dissapointed">Not that great. Somewhat dissapointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% happy with this product. I attached the phone mount holder onto my bike handlebars but while riding the holder does not stay in place. Once you start encountering road bumps it starts to shift either up or down. I used all the rubber shims and tightened everything securely but the holder still moves around after riding my bike for a while. I&rsquo;ve seen different designs with a wider handlebar clamp that doesn&rsquo;t move around like this does.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-couldn-t-be-happier">I couldn&rsquo;t be happier!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried 3 other bike mounts from other manufacturers for my Samsung Note 4 with a big Otterbox case on it (very large and heavy!). This mount is not only the only one that can hold the phone firmly in place while keeping it accessible, but it was also the easiest to install and easiest to get my phone in and out of!I highly recommend this mount. It is high quality at a good price!</p>

<h5 id="does-not-secure-the-iphone6s-the-weight-distribution-of">Does not secure the iPhone6s+. The weight distribution of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not secure the iPhone6s+. The weight distribution of a wider phone causes the phone to tilt itself with every bump in the road. The knob in the back that tightens the tilt goes loose. There are enough other options on Amazon that I&rsquo;d choose if I had to again. Vibrelli will spam you until you leave a review too - so here it is.</p>

<p>My daughter has this mounted on her scooter and her iphone 7 fits perfectly and secure.</p>

<h5 id="it-does-seem-like-a-good-mount">It does seem like a good mount</h5>

<p>It does seem like a good mount, however, doesn&rsquo;t fit my handlebars good. Slips around and three rubber guards are too tight and two are too loose.</p>
