<h5 id="great-raft-after-researching-many">Great raft. After researching many</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great raft. After researching many, many rafts, I chose the Bestway HydroForce Voyager 1000 and I&rsquo;m very happy with my purchase. The raft is exactly as described by Bestway and, after using it a few times, I&rsquo;ve not noticed any deficiencies.I wanted a raft for doing some fishing and exploring when at lakes. This raft has the size and durability that suits my needs. It has just enough space for myself (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, mostly legs) and my girlfriend (5&rsquo;2&rdquo;, mostly delightful), a small cooler, and some other gear (tackle box, life vests) behind the seats. With the 60&rdquo; oars (most rafts only have 54&rdquo; oars) and inflatable keel, the raft is easy to row and moves along, quickly. Despite what some others have said about the sturdiness of the oars, I&rsquo;ve found them to be of good quality. I&rsquo;d have to assume that those who&rsquo;ve had problems with the oars breaking must be unreasonable, macho goons. I, especially, like the fact that the raft has omni-directional oar locks and that the oars will float.The raft is made of 3 ply vinyl. As best as I could determine (before purchase), the vinyl is 28 mil. in thickness. The other raft I was considering was the Seahawk 3, from Intex. The Seahawk is made from 30 mil., 3 ply vinyl with an extra layer of vinyl on the bottom and a rub strake around the sides. Certainly, this makes the Seahawk even more durable, though it also makes the Seahawk 3 much heavier and larger when deflated and packed down. When doing your own shopping, look at the weight difference between the two rafts. The Seahawk 3 is more than twice as heavy (33lbs. for the Bestway vs. 75lbs. for the Seahawk). This was a deciding factor in me purchasing the Bestway. The other deciding factor was, as I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, was the length of the oars. The Seahawks oars are only 54&rdquo; long&hellip;to move a raft that&rsquo;s more than twice as heavy as the Bestway. Also, if I&rsquo;m by myself, I&rsquo;d rather be packing and hauling a 33lb. raft than a 75lb. raft. I&rsquo;m an adult, and I know how to be careful, so the extra thickness of the Seahawk was more of a negative than a positive. In defense of the Seahawk, I will say that if you plan to put a motor on your raft, the Seahawk will handle a more powerful motor&hellip;though, you&rsquo;ll probably need a more powerful motor to move the Seahawk at the same speed as the Bestway (with a smaller motor) due to the heavier weight of the Seahawk. Aswell, if you plan to use your raft on rivers where there might be some rapids and rocks to be concerned about, you may want to get the Seahawk for the extra durability of the hull.Additional features of the Bestway include a front attachment point for an anchor, front carrying handle, repair patches, and rear grommets for attaching a transom. Unlike some lesser rafts, with the seating in the Bestway not butting up against the back of the inside of the raft, you have space behind the seat to put your battery, or fuel tank, should you choose to use a motor.NOTE: The &ldquo;storage bag&rdquo; mentioned in the advertisements for this raft refers to the black bag that is attached to the inside of the raft for storage of tackle, food, etc. It does not refer to a bag within which the raft can be stored or a bag that can be used for transporting the raft. For storage and transporting, I recommend, whether you buy this raft or another, that you purchase a plastic tote slightly bigger than the box in which the raft comes (good luck folding your raft down to the same size it was in the original box).With proper care and cafeful use, I expect this raft to last me 15 - 20 years. I hope this review will be helpful to all who&rsquo;re shopping for an inflatable raft.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great buy for the money.It has its imperfections but for the price and build quality i cant complain.Boat is sturdy. Dragged it on rocky sand, accidentally on concrete.Had it fully inflated and strapped to my SUVs roof rack, went into a parking garage that was slightly too low.Horrible sounding scraping for about 20 feet.Aside from superficial scratches, the boat took it like a champ.Oars and oarlocks are &ldquo;meh&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just used this raft for the first time today, I&rsquo;m aware that it&rsquo;s very early to leave a review but im quite excited about this product because I think it&rsquo;s AWESOME!!! I&rsquo;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only bc I used it once. But I will update it again if my opinion changes.I bought this for fishing. I hate shore finishing bc I feel like I don&rsquo;t catch as much so I wanted something durable to go into a lake or pond. This is perfect for it. I read a lot of reviews on this and everyone seems to love it too. Which is why I bought it.I didn&rsquo;t use the pump it came with bc I have a bad back and shoulder. I used an air compressor instead which took a minute, 2 at the most.I just ordered a portable one just now on Amazon so hopefully it works good lol. I love how it comes with a bag. I actually used it to hold my ice tea.The oars seem very sturdy and well made. I like how they screw on and off. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about losing them in the water.The boat is quite long and wide but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend more then two people. I think the pictures showed three. You would be very squished. I won&rsquo;t be taking anyone else out on it with me bc I like to have my space. Plus I&rsquo;d be worried if they stuck a hook in it by accident or tipped us over lol. But it is sturdy where you can move around freely without tipping it. I was able to sit many different ways and had no worries of it tipping or getting water in it.I&rsquo;m a female, 5&rdquo;10, 200lbs I was able to sit in a laying down position and on the seat it comes with, with plenty of leg room, I had a huge tackle box and my back pack with me, along with one of the portable seats.I deflated the second seat since I didn&rsquo;t need it.There could be a design change for this but obviously it&rsquo;s not a deal breaker. I just wish there were a few more pole holders. There&rsquo;s only two. One on each side of the raft.I have a Nissan Sentra and strapped this down on my roof. No issues with it blocking my windowshield or back window.</p>

<h5 id="we-love-this-boat-i-bought-a-second-one-this">We love this boat - I bought a second one this &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love this boat - I bought a second one this year. Used it extensively in salt water - held 4 teenage boys no prob (see pix). Very comfortable even for 2 adults &amp; a kid. We even used it with 4 adults and 2 kids - that was crowded, but the boat had no issues (stayed firmly inflated). It is a steal for only $125 (and free shipping). Kids take it out fishing all the time.Be sure to take care of it when packing up after summer, though. Cat claws can puncture the sidewalls - but that was my own fault for not packing it up sooner&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="quality-boat">Quality boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great boat, use it for the bay and trips out to the sandbar. Material is thick and durable. I made my own wood floors which added stability making it able to stand and walk around. So far very Good buy</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product. I use it on the little lake by my house and it is wonderful. It&rsquo;s perfect for two regular size adults or one adult and two large dogs. If you are extra tall or plus size it may only be good for one person of that size but you could still fit an average size person in there with you. I&rsquo;ve seen better rafts but for the price this is top notch. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-so-much-we-bought-a-second">Love it so much we bought a second.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved this boat so much we bought a second. The inner seats can be removed and used as flotation devices or removed to make extra space for your fishing tackle. They can also be moved to a different spot to accommodate longer or shorter legs. I though the ores being attached would annoy me but they make things much easier. The quality of this boat is so much better than any others in it&rsquo;s price range. I am very happy with this boat purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-for-a-great-price">Great quality for a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This boat is everything I had hoped it would be. The construction is very heavy duty. The oars lock in place so you cant accidentally drop them in the water.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tried-it">Tried it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it in an ocean bay. Really holds only 2 adults b/c the rowing takes up a lot of space. Holds air well&amp; easy to inflate with hand pump.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="missing-parts">Missing parts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took to Michigan for first outing. No instructions and no plugs for air hole 2 and 3. So pretty useless. Otherwise seems to be well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-price-range-its-excellent-it-doesn-t-deform-when-you-get-into-it">For the price range its excellent. It doesn&rsquo;t deform when you get into it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price range its excellent. It doesn&rsquo;t deform when you get into it and hold its shape very well (so it doesn&rsquo;t turn into a taco).</p>

<h5 id="super-heavy-and-poor-quality">Super heavy and poor quality</h5>

<p>This boat is super heavy and the quality of the rubber pretty poor. I would not feel comfortable taking it ashore on any beach.</p>

<h5 id="solid-raft">Solid raft</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This raft is pretty solid. I made a marine plywood bottom with two jon boat seats, covered with carpet runner, bought the motor mount and a Minn Kota 30 lb motor, a Minn Kota&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="on-the-fense-just-get-it-already">On the fense? Just get it, already.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It worked so well others were keen on buying one for themselves. This makes any trip afloat much more relaxing. The ores work great.</p>

<p>Arrived on time and was as described. Loved it, and exceeded expectations in durability. Great buy!</p>
