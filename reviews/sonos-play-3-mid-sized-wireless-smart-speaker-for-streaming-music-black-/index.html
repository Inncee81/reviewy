<h5 id="sonos-where-have-been-all-my-life">Sonos, where have been all my life?!?!?!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love my Sonos - so much in fact that I&rsquo;ve bought several for each room in the house, including a Connect to play our current home theater system. Setup is a breeze, sound quality is excellent, and the music sources are vast.I had been researching wireless speakers, including others, like Denon HEOS. I even considered upgrading my current amp to take advantage of newer technology. Up to this point, my wireless speakers were Airplay devices, which are extremely flaky and with limited music sources. Playing music through iTunes and Airplay can also be frustrating. I experience numerous drops, not only in my Airplay speakers, but also from my Apple TV playing through my home theater.Sonos solved all of this. I&rsquo;ve experienced no drops since day 1. My house is sizable - 2 story and a pretty large footprint. They are the same Wifi network (no boosters) and sound quality is excellent. I love that I can access my entire iTunes library, Apple Music and Spotify in one app. We tend to listen to a lot of streaming radio stations - I love that the Sonos app defaults to the radio channel on Spotify when searching for an artist.There are a few improvements I would love to see. Are you listening Sonos?First, if the power goes out, or the app freezes (it happens sometimes), the speaker grouping is lost. Why can&rsquo;t the app be smart enough to remember the last grouping? It easily could.Second, during significant power outages (we had some during Harvey), the speakers can become confused and not reconnect to the network. I learned that rebooting my router solved the issue, but only after re-powering a few speakers to find they still not reconnect. The software should be smart enough to retry connections. All my other devices reconnected just fine. Why can&rsquo;t Sonos?Last, the Sonos app will prompt for your password when it should remember you. This is only when adding additional speakers, or larger changes - not on standard daily use. But I feel that if I am on the same device, I should not be prompted again. Allow to the user to stay signed in.All in all, I HIGHLY recommend these I regret not finding them sooner.</p>

<h5 id="great-addition-to-an-existing-system">Great Addition to an Existing System</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Delivered on time in impeccable condition. Intended to install it the next day but Jane grabbed it and installed it herself. Instructions and packaging were easily followed and she had it working on our previously installed Sonos network in less than an hour. The ability to use two PLAY:3&rsquo;s and a Play:5 separately makes differing musical tastes manageable. The Sonos system continues to deliver better sounding music with each software upgrade. Great system!</p>

<h5 id="love-love-love-my-sonos">LOVE&hellip;LOVE&hellip;LOVE MY SONOS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 3rd speaker with Sonos and I obviously love it! I have the sound bar and the bass and 2 speakers. At our beach house I bought the sound bar and just one speaker to place outside when we are relaxing. The great thing is that I am not very technical and even I can hook it up and it sound!!! This is quite a feat in my eyes. I love the fact that I have an app that controls the Sonos and completely rely on Pandora for my music these days. I would not hesitate to buy this speaker.</p>

<h5 id="sonos-hits-a-home-run-again">Sonos hits a home run again&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have 10 other Sonos speakers. Our others are black. The white 3&rsquo;s work well in our more &ldquo;formal&rdquo; living and dining rooms. we have 5&rsquo;s, a Sub and Playbars so we weren&rsquo;t sure about the sound of a 3. They are great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-for-the-size">Not bad for the size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have several of these speakers spread throughout our house, and I&rsquo;d say for most of the rooms they are able to fill it with sound quite nice. For larger rooms the PLAY:5 may have been better, but I didn&rsquo;t want to spend quite that much on speakers. I think these were a good compromise between size and price. We have since bought more of this size to fill other areas of the house.</p>

<h5 id="one-fine-internet-speaker">One fine internet speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one impressive speaker. I thought it might be a little high priced but it is definitely worth it. Right out of the box, it fired right up and was very easy to log on to my Wi-Fi. I was easily able to download the Sonos App which handily helped me set up. I started with my iPhone but added an ipad and my PC. I am so far playing music from Pandora and Amazon Music. There are many music options and hundreds of radio stations available. I love this internet speaker. The sound is clear and this little speaker fills the whole down stairs of my house in clear wonderful music. It is so easy to use, I still can&rsquo;t believe it. Sonos is definitely a quality system.</p>

<h5 id="the-setup-was-super-easy-and-intuitive">The setup was super easy and intuitive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG. I have wanted a Sonos speaker for so long but have been a Bose loyalist for the past 15 years. Since trying Sonos I will not be purchasing any other portable speaker system.The setup was super easy and intuitive. When I went to install the app on my wife&rsquo;s phone I expected to encounter some problems but her setup was just as easy as mine. She has her own music accounts added or she can also listen to mine.I love that Sonos is connected via WiFi, which means the Sonos system covers the entire range of my WiFi network. As long as my WiFi reaches all the rooms where I have my Sonos wireless speaker, I don&rsquo;t have any issues with range. Music keeps playing — without skips, delays or drops — regardless of where my phone is. I&rsquo;ve always had problems with Bluetooth because I would walk out of range with my phone in my pocket and the music would skip or stop playing.Also with Bluetooth, my phone notification sounds would sometimes interrupt the music but not with Sonos.The sound coming from my Sonos is amazing. Nothing but uncompressed, crystal clear sound.I love being able to add all of my music services. I have XM/Sirius, Spotify, and Pandora connected to the Sonos app.I highly recommend the Sonos music system. My only concern is the price. It&rsquo;s a lot of money to lay out but you get what you pay for.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-wait-buy-it">Don&rsquo;t wait&hellip;BUY it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own two Play 5s and wanted a play 3 for my office. The sound, while second to the Play 5 is very very good. Most people probably wouldn&rsquo;t notice the difference between the two. I think SONOS makes a remarkable product and their mobile app, support and software updates are the gold standard of ease.</p>
