Even if rated lower, OEM batteries typically slightly outlast aftermarket products. Coming into the comparison test that is exactly what I expected to find. I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find the Wasabi 21% higher mAh rating over OEM to be fairly accurate. My recording time test yielded 25% longer record time over OEM and 35% longer than the rival Smatree batteries<em>. I also noticed the Wasabi batteries appeared to retain stored power longer than it&rsquo;s rival, but were comparable to the OEM battery. I believe the primary differences in battery performance between Smatree and Wasabi can be credited to Wasabi using a Lithium-Polymer core, exactly the same as the OEM. Smatree battery is the only one of the three that used a Li-Ion core. The only complaint was that the Wasabi battery had a very snug fit inside the camera. I am unable to test the long -term size variation in the product (since it&rsquo;s new) to see if the batteries will increase/decrease with use, but I expect it to be very minimal due to the use of a Li-Poly core.Timed Battery Performance</em>:OEM 1050mAh - 69:55Smatree 1200mAh - 64:33Wasabi 1280mAh - 87:26*Recording time settings: GoPro3 w/ latest Firmware, Sandisk 32GB CL10, Video mode @ 1080/60fps, NO Wi-Fi, 2 Led flash, Indoors, avg room temp 65F; Batteries used: brand new Wasabi 1280mAh 4.7Wh Li-Poly, brand new Smatree 1200mAh 4.4Wh Li-Ion, 1 month old (charged twice) GoPro OEM 1050mAh 3.885Wh Li-PolyThe OEM and comparable Smatree kits include AC adaptors that feature international outlet support. Perhaps convenient, I don&rsquo;t see this as a huge advantage due to accessibility of USB ports globally. The inclusion of a DC port adds another in-car charging option internationally as well. The Smatree and OEM AC adaptors are physically 50%+ larger than the Wasabi&rsquo;s AC Adaptor that featured foldable prongs. More importantly the Wasabi features 3.1A total output and the other only offer 2.1A and 2.0A. The increased amperage output is a huge advantage in using the AC adaptor to charge large item (tablet) and 2 batteries at once. Something that might be an annoyance to some is that the Smatree AC adaptor feature a VERY light blue LED, while the Wasabi and OEM offerings do not. NOTE: Wasabi is now offering a Worldwide Kit with a AC charger similar to the Smatree kit but with 3.1A and more plug adaptors.The DC adaptors offered by all 3 kits feature 2 ports and 2.0A (OEM) or 3.1A (Smatree/Wasabi). All disappointingly don&rsquo;t offer replaceable fuses. The Wasabi physical size is the largest of the three, but is only slightly larger. The Wasabi is the only one of the three to feature an LED. The Smatree charger was labeled with a part number YXT-SC029, but that only appears to reference its generic nature.The Wasabi and Smatree have charging bases and USB cords that are nearly 100% identical, and worked similarly. GoPro&rsquo;s dual charger positions the batteries horizontal instead of vertical. All feature charging LEDS that change color to indicate charging or not charging.GoPro still appears to be the leader in build quality, but the entire Wasabi kit still feels very much above average. The Wasabi DC charger might have been the largest but it&rsquo;s no-seam exterior construction seemed to be better design than the other 2.MY VERDICT: The impressive Wasabi batteries and quality AC &amp; DC adaptor makes this kit a MUST buy for any GoPro user working with a budget and needing longer battery performance. At the time of this review the Wasabi kit was slightly (+-5%) more expensive than the Smatree kit, but even at a 50-60% price premium the Wasabi kit is well worth the cost over their rival. I&rsquo;d much rather have longer recording times per battery than more batteries with shorter recording time.</p>

<h5 id="great-deal-for-gopro-batteries-and-duel-charger">Great deal for GoPro batteries and duel charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great deal for GoPro batteries and duel charger. The batteries run at least as long if not longer than the OEM batteries. I bought a spare one of those some time back since I primarily use the GoPro for filming underwater while scuba diving. It seems that my 3+ black doesn&rsquo;t always last long enough for 2 dives which is the typical dive trip. I usually swap the batteries between dives just to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t die when there is something very interesting to shoot. Having the ability to charge 2 batteries at once is great. Much better than my single battery wall charger which requires monitoring, swapping out and is a pain since I&rsquo;m usually using it while on vacation. For the price, the charger alone would be good. The batteries are good quality not like a made in China knock off replacement I thought I&rsquo;d try while purchasing various GoPro accessories from a vendor. That battery doesn&rsquo;t even last one dive! Dives usually are 45-60 minutes plus a little time getting into and out of the water with the camera on.</p>

<h5 id="poorly-designed-charger-quickly-deteriorating-batteries">Poorly designed charger, quickly deteriorating batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My experience with this set was mostly negative.Firstly, the charger does not have any feature that would guarantee its positive engagement with the battery. Electical contact between the charger and the battery depends on how hard one presses the battery into the slot. Often the battery comes loose in the slot and loses the connection. In such situations the charger LED turns green (as if the battery is fully charged), while in reality the battery is not charged. Pushing the battery in makes the LED turn red again. This is very unreliable.Secondly, after using these batteries for a while (rotating two Wasabi batteries and one OEM GoPro battery on a daily basis) I see that these Wasabi batteries deteriorated much faster than the OEM battery. My original GoPro battery still ensures 1+ hour of continuous operation of my Hero 3+, while these Wasabi batteries now last only 20-30 minutes.</p>

<h5 id="defective-wall-charger">Defective wall charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was excited for this product as it seemed to be a great value however the charger arrived with a rattling sound and doesn&rsquo;t charge continually. With any small movement it sparks and gets very hot. Very disappointed In the quality of this wasabi product.Edit - After posting of my bad charger the seller contacted me and sent me a replacement unit. I must say I am very impressed with the customer service and I am happy to say the new unit works as expected.Thanks</p>

<h5 id="could-use-some-quality-control">Could use some Quality Control</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Could use some quality control. One of the batteries arrived looking like the plastic sticker is the only thing holding it together. The battery is visibly much thicker than the other and the GoPro battery and doesn&rsquo;t even come close to fitting into the camera. It&rsquo;s difficult to tell if the battery case itself on these is made of cardboard or just a really thin plastic, but the case on this one obviously wasn&rsquo;t made/assembled right. Hard to believe someone put the sticker on this thing without noticing the battery was practically falling apart. It&rsquo;s possible it was OK when it left the factory, but if it fell apart this bad in shipping then it doesn&rsquo;t speak too well about the longevity of the batteries either. Of course Amazon won&rsquo;t let you just exchange the bad one, so have to send all of it back.Not sure if I want another one at this point, but might give it a second try just because they are so cheap.</p>
