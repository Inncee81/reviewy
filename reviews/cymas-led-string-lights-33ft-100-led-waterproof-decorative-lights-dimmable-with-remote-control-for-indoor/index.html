<h5 id="excellent-accent-lighting-for-any-purpose">Excellent accent lighting for any purpose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying that the lights I received were slightly different than the stock photos. The remote control, power source and IR controller were different but still very functional.The light strand is 33 ft long and had &ldquo;warm white&rdquo; LED&rsquo;s every 4 inches for a total of 100 lights.The lights have adjustable brightness from 10% to 100% in 10% increments. The remote I received has a button for each setting (10,20,30&hellip;)The lights also have several different modes of flashing if thats your thing. Everything functioned as expected.I plan on stapling these lights up underneath my bar for some cool accent lighting. copper wire is very flexible and should be a breeze to install.I can&rsquo;t imagine you&rsquo;d want anything more from an inexpensive set of LED lights.Keep up the good work!!!I&rsquo;ve included some photos of the lights sitting on my bar at 10, 50 and 100% brightness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They came exactly as described! I don&rsquo;t use any of the flash settings but I do know they work and the dimmer is perfect! I love that the remote has 100%, 50%, and 25% presets! It makes finding the right lighting so much quicker. I use mine every day and have yet to be disappointed. I intend to order more when I move into my apartment next fall!</p>

<h5 id="great-lights-but-one-tip-should-you-need-to-cut-shorten-them">Great lights but one tip should you need to cut (shorten) them.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I recently purchased these light, not for me but for work. I figured, what they hey&hellip;they were only $10 at the time. I work for a hotel but our garage where we park our cars is in the same building as a car rental business and although they have very little to do with our part of the garage, their customer sometimes pose a hazard when they don&rsquo;t read the signs.There is this one HUGE sign that their customers should be able to see but apparently don&rsquo;t. It tells them what to do after they pull into the garage. From my office, I can see them just sitting in their car waiting for someone to come and help them. If they can, they will but if it&rsquo;s busy they can&rsquo;t but the person will still just sit there&hellip;with this HUGE sign right in front of them, telling them what to do.Which now comes to these lights. Again, I personally didn&rsquo;t need them but thought it might be something good to get for them to draw more attention to that HUGE sign&hellip;.that people can&rsquo;t see.So today I started stringing up the lights around that sign, using &ldquo;5-second fix) to secure the thin cable in place&hellip;which worked very well, by the way. When I was done I had quite a bit leftover, wondering if I should just continue wrapping it around the sign till the end of the cable but I looked up in the &ldquo;Frequent Questions&rdquo; to see if the cable could be cut and still function. It said that it could.So I looked at the end of the cable to see what was completing the connection for the lights to work and all it was, was solder. But the 3 wires that connect all these lights seemed bare wires and I wondered how they were working with all these wires touching each other?So I took a pair of wire cutters and snipped it to the length I needed but when I touched the wires together again, the lights wouldn&rsquo;t come on! I looked at the end again that was before I cut the wires and it was just solder completing the connection. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why the lights weren&rsquo;t coming on if these were bare wires!Then I thought, &ldquo;what if these aren&rsquo;t bare wires and there was some coating on them. So what I did was took a pair of pliers and used the &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; of the pliers by stripping any coating (if any) to truly make them bare wires. Sure enough, that was it. Now there are three wires to figure out which ones need to be soldered together or just twisted together (which is what I did). So if you do need to shorten the wires by cutting them, you&rsquo;ll need to strip the ends as well and find out which ones need to be connected. I couldn&rsquo;t find any instructions or tips that told me to do that. But they&rsquo;re working great now!</p>

<p>I had been wanting an LED light set for on my wreath that I use on my front porch. It doesn&rsquo;t catch enough sun light there to have a solar powered set and I didn&rsquo;t want it to be battery powered since I have an electrical outlet right where the wreath is. I also wanted to have an option of the light string to do different things with the lights because I use the wreath year round with every holiday I change out the theme.

<h5 id="not-bad-but-not-long-lasting">Not bad, but not long lasting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pretty lights, and I love how small and subtle they are. I keep them up and have them on all day long, but after about 5 months, they&rsquo;re super dim now. It&rsquo;s not unusual for LED strings, but my bigger strand of Xmas tree lights lasted way longer.But to be honest, I&rsquo;ll probably just keep replacing them because they look so much better than the thick strands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty">Pretty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So these lights are actually really really beautiful and bright for being such a tiny tiny bulb. The wiring tangled soo easily and took me time to fix because it was just a hot mess. That being said I did enjoy this wiring (it looks like rose gold copper) because it was easily bendable. The remote also is extremely helpful and I enjoyed the dimming feature. If you&rsquo;re decorating a big space you&rsquo;re going to need more than one. Also considering using it to make a sign for a wall decoration.</p>
