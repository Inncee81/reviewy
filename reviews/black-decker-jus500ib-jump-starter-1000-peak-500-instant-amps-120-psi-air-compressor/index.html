<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="an-emergency-truck-would-have-been-cheaper">An emergency truck would have been cheaper!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product from Amazon 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> month ago for $80. I fully charged it initially as recommended. About a month ago I used it to jump-start a truck - worked great. I recharged it after use. Then two weeks ago I used it to inflate a bicycle tire - again worked great, and again I plugged it in to recharge. Last week I went to use it a third time. There was no charge showing on the tester. When I plug it in, it shows fully charged on the tester, but when I remove the plug, it shows no charge and is unusable. Several days charging has no effect. I am very disappointed in B&amp;D for producing a product that only works twice - even one star is too much. I will see if it can be repaired, but the nearest service center is 150 miles away, and it&rsquo;s way too heavy to pay shipping on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-good-but-not-all-there">Looks Good But Not All There</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks good, charged up OK (48 hours as instructed), and 12 days later it still indicates full charge. It came with only a ball needle in the attachments bin that pictures three - not good. It also is missing the quick connect air valve coupler that is used for car tires. One would have to manually screw it onto the valve which is a pain in the neck. I plan to complain to the company and ask for these three items not provided as expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-air-compressors">POOR AIR COMPRESSORS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these. .Air compressors are a joke! Gauges don&rsquo;t work, but I rely on hand gauge anyway. Not enough air pressure. Takes too long to fill a tire and the compressors overheat.I haven&rsquo;t had an opportunity to check out the jump starters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-product-and-am-very-pleased-with-the-customer">Love the product and am very pleased with the customer &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this at my husband&rsquo;s request. We had an older version and it finally just wore out! We have a mini-farm and use this for inflating wheelbarrow tires, jump starting a tractor, etc. When the unit came, the box had, shall we say, been abused. It had been opened and re-taped. The plastic case on the unit was cracked. I contacted Amazon to see what to do about the issue. I had a response within a few hours letting me know that a replacement had been shipped. The new unit arrived, all in one piece. It is charged up and ready to use. Love the product and am very pleased with the customer service I got from Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="internal-a-c-charger-failed-in-15-mo-now-useless">Internal (A/C) charger failed in 15 mo, now useless</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked as promoted a few times. When I let it alone x 2 months (?about), it was too weak to work, but resumed on supplemental charging.Then in cold weather, the compressor&rsquo;s distal end valve clamp (to hold on &amp; mate with the tire&rsquo;s valve) broke when I clamped it. Now I&rsquo;m in long search for new one I can attach.= &ndash; = &ndash; = &ndash;Update: terrific add-on fixed MUCH better than original&rdquo;Problem Solvers Air-Bob Universal Tire Inflator Replacement Head - Replacement Head for PU9997&rdquo;It was $11, but no longer sold at Amazon. SorryUpdate:Now learn that the device&rsquo;s own A/C to D/C charger is broken, no longer accepting AC input, and that it&rsquo;s become a useless piece of toxic waste. Very discouraged that in my 15 mo of use, it performed 2x jump-starts, then failed. Surely any prudent user charges it more often than needs it, so can&rsquo;t imagine my use-pattern could be blamed. Mfgr was sympathetic, but &ldquo;out-of-warrantee&rdquo; so no help.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keeps-its-promises-and-then-some">Keeps its promises and then some</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I keep a spare car at my summer home. I knew that it would have a dead battery and low tires when I got there after 3 months. I ordered it on Amazon and it arrived the same day I did. The sticker on the box says charge for 48 hours. It was ready in 3 hours. It started my car and pumped the tires. Esay to use and very powerful. First class. My own private AAA</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-buy-bough-the-first-one-for-me-to">A great buy. Bough the first one for me to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great buy. Bough the first one for me to use on my 1997 F-350 7.3L diesel in the winter. Amazed that it started my diesel. I bought 3 more for my 3 adult children for Christmas. Two of them have put it to use and love it.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-thing-since-sliced-batteries">The Best Thing Since Sliced Batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do too many reviews on products I buy, but I do buy a heck of a lot of stuff from Amazon. This item is worth of a good review because of its ease of use, the potential to get you out of trouble and its use with some of my toys and garden products.When I got it I charged it up as directed and lo and behold, after just two days, my spare truck battery died on me. Wow, I was glad I have the B&amp;D Jump Starter and whacked it onto the truck battery and boom, it started and we were in business at the first time of asking. Then my Sears Lawn Tractor started playing up and the battery was going down. So out came the B&amp;D again and boom, it started and off we went again.I have used it several more times including helping out a couple of neighbors. When you have as many motorized tools as I have, this is a must have but I have only just found that out.I would recommend this Jump Starter to anyone who is thinking about one. I thought long and hard and checked out quite a few before I bought. I should have gone with the B&amp;D right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-not-recommend">Can not recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this and unit would not charge. I was never able to use it at all. I would not recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Garbage. Died after one or two uses</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="avoid">Avoid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When it worked it was great. Then after about two years, it stopped charging (as in it wouldn&rsquo;t charge when plugged in) so now it is useless. I expected better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently received my compressor with no nozzles, how do you inflate tires?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-charger-inflator">Great Charger/Inflator</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A little slow when inflating a car tire, but what a sturdy, dependable tool. This is my 2nd one. The first lasted 12 years before it would no longer accept charging up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-greatest">the greatest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a sorority house mom I bought this two years ago and leave it plugged in all of the time, On a campus where parking isover crowded this has been the greatest thing in&hellip;</p>

<p>Excellent</p>

<h5 id="quality-product">quality product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an earlier version that had parts fail prematurely due to bad design. I wouldn&rsquo;t risk buying something like this from Black &amp; Decker. Poor quality and bad design.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-price-the-pump-died">Not worth the price&hellip; the pump died &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not worth the price&hellip; the pump died in less than 8 months. 2 year warranty if you want to pay to ship it back or take it in to a shop.</p>
