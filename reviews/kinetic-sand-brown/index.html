<blockquote>
<p>We first came across this in a display at the local science museum, where it proved more popular than many of the exhibits with a constant crowd of kids gathered around it at all times. Even their parents couldn&rsquo;t keep from playing in it. Then my son&rsquo;s art teacher had some and the kids would rush in each day to have a little extra time in the sandbox.This feels just like regular sand, only perpetually slightly moist; like that ideal beach stand, perfect for building castles and other structures, or just squeezing between your fingers. It sticks to itself, but not to you, and actually is far less clingy than &ldquo;real&rdquo; sand.It&rsquo;s very hard to describe without actually touching it yourself, but it&rsquo;s soft and dry, yet molds perfectly. Squeezing it through your hands is almost like dry water &hellip; If that makes any sense. It&rsquo;s the consistency of very dry cookie dough, without any stickiness. As moldable as Play-Doh &hellip; That then slowly separates itself back into individual grains. It flows, but holds together, though it also sticks only to itself.Squeezing and molding it is an oddly relaxing sensation and with this, a lidded box and a few co-opted Play-Doh mold toys, my usually frenetic son, 7, has played with this sand for hours. It&rsquo;s also been one of the most popular playdate experiences at our house for about a month now. Heck, he and I (mom) played in there for almost an hour the other day, just because. As an adult I&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s strangely soothing and stress-relieving.My only advice is save yourself the double purchase and skip right ahead to buying this larger version: Waba Fun Kinetic Sand - 11 Lbs, cause you&rsquo;re probably going to end up wanting more anyway. (The 2 lb. box is quite small.)Serious fun for kids of all ages. We&rsquo;ve had all ages from 2-52 in the house, and all are taken with this unique and awesome toy that encourages imagination, hands-on sensory exploration and creativity.Oh and, yes, this the same sand they sell at Brookstone for three times the price, just FYI.</p>

<p>This kinetic sand brand is the best I have found. I looked up a comparison video on Youtube and viewed about 6 different brands compared in different &ldquo;tests&rdquo; side by side and of them all, I preferred the properties of this brand. It packs down firmly into molds, holds it&rsquo;s shape well but also breaks down and flows as beautifully as any kinetic sand. It will cut with a knife or cookie cutter with a satisfying crunch, is super easy to clean up by using a larger glob of the sand to attract the bits.It leaves no residue on your hands, you don&rsquo;t have to worry to much about your child having residual sand on their hands and wiping their eyes.Easily vacuumed out of carpet (though honestly you can just pat it with a larger glob of sand as well if the carpets cleaned).It never dries out! We have kept ours in non-air tight tight plastic containers and played with it daily for a month without any signs of drying.When the 2lb box first arrived I was worried it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough sand to actually do anything with&hellip;.but with the smaller sized molds I bought for my son, 2lbs is plenty for just him. We bought an extra 2lb box to have to play with him or when friends are over. You can see in my pictures, the 2lbs of sand packed tight in my hand, and then &ldquo;fluffed&rdquo; out in the container.My only complaint, and you can see it in my pictures&hellip;the &ldquo;brown&rdquo; sand can come in different shades of brown. One of the &ldquo;brown&rdquo; shades is actually brown&hellip;the other is almost a greyish white.</p>

<h5 id="so-much-fun">So much fun</h5>

<p>This sand is great for a small indoor sand box - perfect for rainy days and also a wonderful sensory activity that kids will enjoy daily. This sand is special, like a mix between play dough, sand and magic. Not gonna lie, I enjoy playing with it too! It&rsquo;s very easy to make shapes with it using molds. My 3 year old can make perfect little castles.We got 4 pounds of sand and bought a Sterilite container for it at a local chain store ($3.99). It&rsquo;s comparable to the little indoor sand containers they sell for over $20. We also purchased a fun molds kit on Amazon. For under $35 total, this makes a fantastic activity.I will probably need to get more sand in the future as a little get out of the box every time. Because it kind of sticks together, I&rsquo;m able to put most of it back in our box.</p>

<p>Its like sand/dough! Was worried about its consistency compared to other brands (not that I know what any of them feel like) but I have to say I am pleased with this product.Love the way it looks as you hold it in your hand as gravity takes course and it falls out of your hand back down (again its like sand dough)From looking at videos on youtube I would say its comparable to Brookstone sand thats $30+ and so because it has a clear container/bottle that says &ldquo;sand&rdquo; youre gonna pay $15+ more (might as well buy 2 of these)Clean UP IS A BREEZE youll have MINIMAL loss (if any at all) just be smart about where youre going to use this or let your children use this.Its NOT WET it leaves NO FILM ON YOUR HAND (though it initially smells &ldquo;weird&rdquo; when first opening it)Almost impossible to sculpt with your fingers (its not regular wet sand) you need a sculpting utensil (what ever that may be) though it is sand it has a more comparable consistency to a &ldquo;flaky dough&rdquo; ( i cant explain it really) but it feels cool in your hands and looks cool as well!NOTE: Item comes in a clear bag within the sealed box ( I went and bought a blue clear &ldquo;thermos&rdquo; bottle/container from the dollar store which contained the whole 2lbs and will be printing the box&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kinetic Sand&rdquo; logo on a sticker paper and putting that on the container that now houses the sand (youre going to need something to keep this in after you open it if even a zip lock bag)</p>

<h5 id="great-sand-but-not-the-colored-sand">Great Sand (but NOT the colored sand)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would shop around for price&hellip;even on amazon this product is sold with different pricing. BUT do NOT buy the colored sand&hellip;just get the tan. We purchased the purple sand and I still have purple spots on my carpet. But it really is fun to play with! My son loves it and so do the adults!!</p>
