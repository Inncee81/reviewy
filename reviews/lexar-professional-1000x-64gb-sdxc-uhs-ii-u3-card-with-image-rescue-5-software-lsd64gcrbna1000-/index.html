<h5 id="128gb-perfect-for-4k-30p-video">128GB, Perfect for 4K 30p video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Panasonic DMC-LX100 which can record 4K 30p video at a 100Mbps bitrate and sometimes recording would stop with an error saying the card&rsquo;s write speed cannot keep up. This happened with a $28 PNY Elite Performance SDXC 64GB UHS-1 90MB/sec card so I got this Lexar SDXC 128GB 150MB/sec UHS-3 card and it works perfectly for 4K 30p. UHS-1 guarantees a minimum write speed of 10MB/s while UHS-3 has a minimum of 30MB/s which is probably where a UHS-1 card falls down for 4K.I informally tested the Lexar by recording four back to back 15 minute 4K recordings and the LX100 got very warm, but there was not a single hiccup. The Lexar card also recorded 100 12MP still shots in the 11fps high speed burst mode before slowing down. The PNY could manage 95 shots before slowing down so it&rsquo;s not a huge difference for stills, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to risk using the PNY for video and having a 4K recording stop unexpectedly. In Windows 7 with an OCZ Vertex 4 SSD and Transcend USB 3.0 card reader, I copied a 6.5GB file to and from the Lexar card and it averaged about 60-65MB/s writing TO the card and copying FROM the card averaged 87-90MB/s. Basically, this Lexar Pro card seems to be rock solid for 4K recording and I will update this review if I have any problems.On a side note, it annoys me that even though most cameras format SD cards in exFAT which no longer has a 4GB file limit size like FAT32 did, a 30 minute clip will still be broken up into 6 or so separate 4GB files. I&rsquo;d like the option to record a video into one giant file. In addition, most cameras limit video recording to 30 minutes due to some EU tax applied to camcorders, but since we&rsquo;re in the US, I don&rsquo;t see why we should be stuck with this limit too. Fortunately, the US version of the upcoming Panasonic DMC-FZ2500 4K camera seems to have no recording duration limit and may even support files of up to 96GB with an SDXC card. I can&rsquo;t wait to see if this is true.UPDATE (09-29-2015) - I uploaded benchmark results with a new card reader Kingston Digital MobileLite G4 USB 3.0 Multi-Function Card Reader (FCR-MLG4) and CrystalDiskMark 5.0.2 x64, Windows 10 Pro.READ (MB/s): 152.7, 14.67, 152.3, 11.52WRITE (MB/s): 86.69, 1.231, 85.15, 1.180With tape over extra ports:READ (MB/s): 91.87, 13.18, 92.92, 10.04WRITE (MB/s): 75.92, 1.134, 75.50, 1.093UPDATE (11-16-2016) - My card is still going strong and I haven&rsquo;t had any problems. I am looking at new cameras like the Panasonic DMC-FZ2500, Fujifilm X-T2 (two UHS-II card slots!) and the Sony A6500 so I may buy more of these Lexar SDXC cards and make the old reliable one as the backup.</p>

<p>it works with my Canon 6D. fast writing,loading to computer. even though some reports says Canon does not support this fast technonlogy (Class 4) for now. But it is still backward compatible with the normal memory cards ( Class 10)&hellip;future proof , bought when on sale.</p>

<h5 id="good-price-good-performance-this-is-now-my-card-of-choice-for-4k-video-and-fast-raw-photo-shooting">Good price, good performance. This is now my card of choice for 4K video and fast raw photo shooting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I seem to acquire memory cards like candy, and may be slightly obsessed in some odd ways&hellip;This Lexar card at the price of under $40 (at this time) is one of, if not the leader in the price/performance arena. The PNY has kept at the best bang for the buck, but the sandisk has started to come down in price as well with its 95mb/sec model. But this lexar with a read speed up to 150mb/sec comes in right between them in price, while edging out the read performance by a margin, and having a write speed that&rsquo;s better than the PNY, and a bit worse than the sandisk. Let&rsquo;s break it down:-Priced smack in the middle, a good overall deal-150mb/sec read, about 75mb/sec write-Good for many flavors of 4K video-Read speed bests nearest competition-Write speed better than PNY elite, a notch slower than Sandisk 95mb/sec-Lexar is known as one of the more reliable brands-To get full speed, you need hardware that actually supports it!Frequently i see reviews about high speed cards which complain about poor performance, and it&rsquo;s a safe bet that it&rsquo;s not the card that&rsquo;s the problem. There are numerous card readers out there, and a handful of standards (ever heard of usb 3 boost/turbo?), and various other factors which will determine the overall speed.The main three speed limters: the card reader, the size &amp; number of files, and the destination drive. If you&rsquo;re transferring a bunch of small files, it will be slower, if your card reader is old/outdated/slower standard, it will be slower, and if the drive your copying to is older/outdated/slower, than the card will max out that drive&rsquo;s write speed if it&rsquo;s slower.Summed up: this card is a good price to performance deal, and handily will take on your photo/video/various tasks.</p>

<h5 id="extremely-terrible-quality-control">Extremely Terrible Quality Control</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing professional free-lance work for the last 5 years, and shoot just about a wedding every weekend. I have tried multiple cards from multiple manufactures, and without a doubt, this is the worst card. I ordered two from Amazon, and within one week, BOTH cards failed on me. I have an A7s, 5Dmkiii, and 6D, and none of them could read. So I swapped them out for two more. Again, within a week, BOTH NEW CARDS completely stopped working. That&rsquo;s 4 failed cards. Two other wedding videographers I work with have also had this card fail on them. I simply can not recommend a card that has this type of track record.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-fast-speed-even-without-uhs">Very fast speed even without UHS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This card is really fast! I just tested it with a standard SDXC USB 3.0 reader (one that doesn&rsquo;t have the extra row of UHS connections), and I was able to copy a 2GB video clip from my PC&rsquo;s SSD to the Lexar card at 71.2MB/sec. It took less than 30 seconds! Reading from the card was even faster, and I saw a continuous 85.4MB/sec when I copied the video onto another SSD :-)This is the fastest SD card I&rsquo;ve ever owned, and I&rsquo;ll probably get a new UHS reader so I can transfer newly recorded videos to my PC at the full 150MB/sec rate down the road. Even so, I&rsquo;m very happy with the capacity, speed and value of this card right out of the box.UPDATE: I just purchased a UHS-II USB 3.0 reader, and the write speed went up to 81.3MB/sec. The read speed was much higher, at 143MB/sec :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-reliable-card">Good value, reliable card.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Using with an a7s, which is a good pairing. Lexar and Sandisk are my go to SD cards. Never had any corruption or lost images even if they&rsquo;ve gone through the wash. Good transfer rate on a usb 3.0 card reader. Totally worth the cost.</p>
