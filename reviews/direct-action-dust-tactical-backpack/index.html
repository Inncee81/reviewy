</ul>

<p>Designed for Military and Law Enforcement operators, however the camo/solid color selection also makes it a great choice for outdoor enthusiasts. The low profile look and feel makes it a perfect Everyday Carry bag. If you are looking for a heavy duty backpack for your laptop, tablet, iPad, hydration bladder, etc. or just a solid base for your bug out bag. It is the best value for your money.</p>

<p>Its 20+ liter capacity makes this 24 hour backpack great for both patrol and advanced tactical duties. Combat Vent System is our unique ventilation system to provide increased comfort for their operator. Contoured foam profiles with multiple air channels combined with airy mesh keeps the pack off the users back. This enhances air flow to help prevent heat build-up and sweating. Front pocket features an internal organizer for GPS, writing utensils and other small essentials, plus a clear vinyl pocket for maps and documents. Side pockets can carry small items, when unzipped they will fit a standard U.S. canteen or Nalgene. There is also another small flat front pocket that can be used to store additional small items so you do not need to open the main compartments. The laser-cut MOLLE/PALS makes the backpack fully modular with a low profile look. Laser-cut does not absorb water like traditional MOLLE/PALS webbing. Suspension system is based on S-profiled shoulder straps and internal stiffener in the back. The shoulder and waist straps are able to be stowed away in the back panel, turning this pack into a slim, no-snag hand luggage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so I purposefully waited a while before reviewing. I got this bag in June, 2015, and I was thoroughly impressed when I received it. I am a backpack guy, however, and I didn&rsquo;t want to praise the quality before I tested it. By the way, I do not work for any company associated with the brands which I review here, and I did not receive anything from them other than what I paid for. Here we go!The pack was shipped quickly, elegantly, and came with a canvas shopping-type bag with the company&rsquo;s logo on the side. It is the little things, folks. The canvas bag is slim and has two lengths of handles for shoulder carry or briefcase-style carrying. One thing about those canvas sacks - they are never masculine or stylish, no matter where you get them&hellip; unless you get it from Direct Action. Enough about the shopping bag.The first thing people notice about the pack is the paracord handle on top, and people do notice it. The handle is solid, extremely comfortable even with a full bag, and with a purposeful break in a melted seam, it will provide you with two cords totaling 5m. There are attachment points on either side of the handle. Under the handle, there is a flap for your hydration tubing. This pack will actually accommodate two bladders. There is a dedicated bladder pocket right behind the back padding, accessible by opening the velcro on the top and dropping the bladder down into the bag. I keep a three liter bag in that pouch for when I need to fill it up, but this pack can hold water bottles so well that I rarely use the bladder. Another bladder could theoretically be held in the padded laptop pocket which has fastener for the bladder if you choose to use it.The next thing people notice is the laser cut MOLLE on three sides of the pack. This is heavy duty, light, and low profile. I don&rsquo;t have attachments on the pack now, but I put them on when I got it and they fit swimmingly. Very stable. The pack is not waterproof, but I have never had any issues with water getting into the pack while wearing it, and I have been in some serious downpours with this backpack. If you set it on the ground, the drainage grommet will allow water in through the bottom. You could fit a #2 pencil through the grommet, so it isn&rsquo;t too big.The side pockets are very low profile and useful until you unzip one side of the pocket. Then your pocket is quite large, capable of fitting nearly any water bottle or adult beverage in a can/bottle. You&rsquo;d think unzipping and expanding would make it flimsy, but the fabric is sturdy and the whole pocket it supported by an adjustable strap. While we are on the straps, the ancillary support/closing straps on the bag are well placed, quality built, and able to be rolled up into a velcro closure to minimize sound/snagging. When the bag is less than full or empty, cinch down the sides and the bag is very stable. The zippers are quiet, and the rope by which to grab the zippers are covered in heat shrink plastic. There is no jingling or worry of these breaking on my pack. I am impressed with this detail. The main straps are very comfortable and sewn incredibly well, but also lightweight. The curve of the strap gives me confidence even when I sling one over the shoulder and go. There are ample connection options on the straps and the chest strap is comfortable, but subdued so you don&rsquo;t even notice the strap if you choose to not fasten it.The size of the pockets is perfect for EDC. I have been very comfortable for a couple days with it. If you plan to stay out for much longer, you may need a bigger bag, but you didn&rsquo;t buy this bag for that anyways. The larger pocket will hold two six-packs of bottles on top of each other and a 15&rdquo; Macbook Pro, to give an idea of the volume. The main compartment zips open about halfway down and is not clamshell, which I prefer. On a larger bag, I like the clamshell, but this size is perfect for half-zip and allows the bag to sit upright even when it is empty and open. The main pocket has a top-entry, zippered, mesh compartment on the front. This is useful, but out of the way. I keep a pair of gloves and miscellaneous small tools in it.One note: to get the 15&rdquo; Macbook Pro out of the pocket, you have to fold back the top part of the pack, including the handle. This is not difficult and actually acts to better secure the device.The next smaller pocket is an organizer&rsquo;s dream. It is a clamshell pocket, giving easy access to all of the features. Three pen holders of various widths will fit chapstick or lighters. There are two stacked elastic bands next to that. I use them to securely hold both a knife and a flashlight. Another pocket on this row holds a wallet or multi-tool. It is a fold-over velcro closure so it keeps the contents out of sight and this makes the pocket somewhat expandable. Two flat pockets behind these are about six and seven inches deep (estimated, I don&rsquo;t have a ruler handy). Keep flat things in them if you want to use the velcro closures, but if you don&rsquo;t care about that, throw some food or books in them. It&rsquo;s your bag. Below all of these pockets is a velcro-closure mesh pocket that goes to the bottom of the pocket. I keep earbuds and an iPod in it, but it can hold more than that.The most unique pocket is on the other side (fold-down section) of the clamshell. It is clear plastic and would be great for easy map reference or identifying information. It is accessed from he bottom-up zipper. I keep a fun painting in it with laminated maps behind, just in case&hellip;Onto my favorite part of the pack&hellip; The outermost &ldquo;small&rdquo; pocket, right behind the webbing, is actually why I bought the Dust. It fits PERFECTLY a Bose Color Soundlink speaker, which I keep charged and in the pack at all times. When I am biking, hiking, walking around downtown, I am always playing tunes from my pack. My Dust really brings the party. I have to wrap the speaker in a handkerchief or shirt because it moves so much air that the webbing will occasionally rattle, but filling it up a bit removes the sound. This is such a great pairing that I had to mention it.Go ahead and buy this backpack for short-term trips and EDC. It is the best in it&rsquo;s class. My plan is to save up for a larger bag from Direct Action to replace my older 3 day bags. This is my first product from the company, I have no doubt that I will be just as happy with their other packs. Direct Action does things right. Good luck!Edit, 13 October 2016: Still loving this bag. It is showing no wear. I spent a lot of time outside in the rain during Hurricane Matthew, speaker and all. I just covered the bag with a universal waterproof pack cover which I keep in the bladder compartment at all times.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-not-the-size-but-how-you-use-it">It&rsquo;s not the size but how you use it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small day pack. Easily holds laptops or tablets and keeps it separate from your sweat shirt or whatever else you&rsquo;re carrying without having to dig in and out. Very front side zipper works great for quickies and the admin pouch makes sure you&rsquo;re not hoarding 15 fire starters. Inside pockets do not feel cheap and they work well. Pen pouches are big enough for tactical pens, pen lights, and sharpies. Meaning, you have more then enough room in them for anything else. Rest of the pockets pretty much are what you think. They fit what they are made for and do so well. The handle is all paracord and feels great. Overall this is a great little pack. It&rsquo;s small so it&rsquo;s going to leave out a lot of stuff other packs have but it gives you what you need and does it well. Plus with the added laser cut you can expand to carry more stuff you don&rsquo;t need&hellip; Good pack, I will be buying from them again soon. 2 weeks shipping to California. Also comes with a added bag for your dearest babe.</p>

<h5 id="best-bag-i-ve-owned">Best bag I&rsquo;ve owned.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Direct Action&rsquo;s Dust bag is the best bag I&rsquo;ve owned, no hype. All the straps are adjustable and stow-able, or removable, and all of the seams and materials are clearly very high quality in feel and appearance. I didn&rsquo;t buy it for fashion but a couple of people mentioned it the first day I used it. It just looks bad@ss.The Dust is their smallest model. It is super sleek on the back, but can be expanded to a certain extent or take attachments for larger payloads.For me it is a great low-profile urban biking or day bag. I was able to carry it comfortably with office clothes, gym clothes, gloves, hat, toiletries bag, sketchbook, moleskin calendar, water bottle, glasses cases etc. Very compact yet roomy.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-pack-i-bought-this-pack-for-use-in">great little pack I bought this pack for use in &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great little packI bought this pack for use in the city and for day hiking and its the perfect pack for me to do this.The fabric is so awesome,very durable and should last a lifetime.i can easily fit all my day hiking gear in it.My Stanley Adventure Camp Cook Set 24oz easily fits in the water bottle holder and my 3 liter water bladder fits in aswell (a 3 liter water bladder is a little oversized for this pack).The molle webbing is very sturdy and you can hang a bedroll or sleeping bag from them,i put an axe on my molle :).I took it out for a hike with all my day stuff in it and was comfortable to wearOverall im happy with this bag and would recommend this for those who want to use 1 pack for both city an rugged outdoors carry.</p>

<h5 id="good-everyday-backpack">Good everyday backpack!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic everyday backpack! It looks great, made from sturdy materiel, great functions such as strap holding velcros, and fits perfectly on my back. The only downside would be the opening of the main sack is a bit smaller than what it can carry. I usually put: 13.3&rdquo; laptop and charger, 2 notebooks, 1 or 2 books in the main one and bring some pens, altoids, wash kit, multitool, and etc with water bottle on the side pocket. The bag may look a bit small when it first came, but after I get used to it, the size is perfect for commute and light traveling.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-small-edc-pack">GREAT SMALL EDC PACK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this pack! I ordered the Kryptek Highlander, It does look a little funny in the picture but looks great in person. This pack is is built strong, very well thought out and extremely compact. It also fits very close and secure to your back. Also, I love the molle and I use it to attach my headphone case. I use it for school every day. I only carry about four notebooks and a 15 inch mac so if you are planning on carrying more than that you should consider the Direct Action Dragon Egg.</p>
