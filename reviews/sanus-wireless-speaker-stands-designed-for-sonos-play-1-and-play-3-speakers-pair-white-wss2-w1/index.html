</ul>

<p>These SANUS speaker stands are designed to work with both the SONOS PLAY:1 and PLAY:3 speakers in any orientation. They position the speakers at the speaker manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended angle and securely support the speaker for optimum bass response. The column and base have wire channels to make the cables disappear. This product is sold as a pair (2 stands - Speakers not included).</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="overall-i-think-this-is-a-decent-product-but-there-are-some-problems">Overall I think this is a decent product, but there are some problems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I opened the box, I could see that one of the posts was damaged. It does not impact functionality, but esthetically it is pretty displeasing because it faces out and is highly visible. I plan to reach out to the seller to see if they can send me a replacement post without having to send the whole unit back.The collars that are meant to disguise the connection points at the top where it meets the underside of the speaker and at the bottom where it meets the base do not seat properly so there is a noticeable gap. Not necessarily a big deal for the bottom, but the top is at eye level when sitting so it’s quite visible.It is sturdy, due in part to a large and heavy base. The bottom weighting is necessary should you want to mount a Play 3 or Play 5 to prevent it from being top-heavy, but is overkill if you are just using them for Play 1s.But the most disappointing thing is that the top mount does not rotate. It is in a fixed position due to a lip that the mount sits on and the base attaches to. It prevents you from being able to orient the direction of the speaker, which for surround sound is critical. In most applications that could be solved by just positioning the whole unit, but when placing these behind a sofa which is close to a wall, you have no option but to put the flat end of the base against the wall which means you can either point it straight ahead, or at about a 70 degree angle; neither position is ideal.I’ll add that the inclusion carpet spikes is a nice touch to ensure the stands stay in place. I use the stands on a hardwood floor surface, so the included rubber footing work well to prevent the base from making contact with the floor (which would otherwise scratch it) and keep the unit from slipping. However, unlike the spikes, here is no height adjustment for the rubber mounts so if you have an uneven floor, expect that you will have to get creative with your own solution, otherwise they will tilt to one side.</p>

<h5 id="thought-husband-was-nuts">Thought husband was nuts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my husband ordered these for our Sonos speakers. We previously had them on our end tables. I loved that these cleared up valuable space on those tables and kept the speakers frombeing knocked over as much (we have two kids).i actually prefer the nice clean look it gives the speakers. See pic attached. Ignore the terrible blinds, we are in an apartment right now in the middle of a move.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="be-careful-with-assembly-instructions">Be careful with assembly instructions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality of the materials is good, but I only offer this caution. Take time to be sure you are installing the right plastic caps on each pole. In the packaging my double (set) packet, the covers for the top and bottom of each stand are not marked as to which goes on which end, and they are packaged in a way that I used both on one stand, and one should have been on the other stand, so I was stuck with 2 with the opening on one stand and 2 with no opening on the other which looks bad. And, they are almost impossible to get on and almost impossible to get off. Just pay attention to what goes where, and you will be fine. Great, excellent service from the company when I pointed this out! I would recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stands-for-sonos-play-1-speakers">Great stands for SONOS PLAY 1 speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since we would be using our speakers in corners of the room with nothing to put them on, these stands were the best choice for us. They&rsquo;re very sturdy and the SONOS PLAY 1 speakers fit nicely on them. They&rsquo;re easily moved (we bring the set outside for entertaining purposes), which was important to us. The only complaint I have is in regards to feeding the power supply wire through the tube for the stand. Not sure if this was only for mine, but one of the tubes continually gave me trouble as the cord would get stuck and bunch up. I had to try it a few times before actually getting it through.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-dresses-up-a-surround-sound-sonos-setup">Really dresses up a surround sound SONOS setup.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a pair of Play 1s for surrounds with a Sub and PlayBase. The sound, flexibility and easy of setup is great, but these stands really make the rear speakers look great. Assembly takes just a few minutes with a screwdriver. The design hides all of the cables and the base is sturdy enough to be solid without cumbersome to move around if you want an impromptu dance party on the back deck. There are dedicated brackets for Play 1 and both vertical and horizontal Play 3 mounting. The box also includes both rubber feet and spikes for carpeted rooms. I have a set of white stands with white speakers which look great together. Speaker is about 4&rsquo; high on the stand which is right at ear level while seated watching TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-right">Just right!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stands are great they&rsquo;re heavy so that the speakers don&rsquo;t fall over and they were simple to put together. I wish the plastic cover at the top and bottom of the post was the same color as the post but it&rsquo;s a slightly cream color instead of white. Not very noticeable but I do wish they were the same color.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-of-the-best-products-i-ve-purchased-recently">One of the best products I&rsquo;ve purchased recently</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the best products I&rsquo;ve purchased recently. The quality is very high, packaging is great and instructions are wonderful. Great touch having the parts for each step of the assembly (very easy by the way) in a sealed section of the film.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-stands">Nice Stands.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A must have if you own SONOS Play 1 speakers. Gives any room a touch of class. I highly recommend this item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-any-space-with-a-classy-look">Great for any space with a classy look.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my speaker stands. It gives space a Classy look and fits into any space without that cluttered look. I recommend these for any household.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-put-them-upside-down-like-i-did-good-luck-getting-them-off">If you put them upside down like I did good luck getting them off</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The end caps are very hard to slide on. If you put them upside down like I did good luck getting them off. For that reason I can&rsquo;t give a five star review.</p>
