<h5 id="cheap-junk-wasted-money">Cheap junk - wasted money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this memory card for my wife&rsquo;s phone. Arrived on time and in good condition. I put it in the phone and it worked as expected. About 2 weeks latter the data and pictures stopped loading onto this card. I took it to my provider and they had their technicians work on it for over an hour but couldn&rsquo;t get the stored data to transfer from phone onto the card. It also would not take info from the card to transfer to my computer. We ended up buying a new name brand sd card for a lot more money. Sad to say, all the data stored on the cheap no name card we ended up throwing away. I learned that you get what you pay for. This card was a price of junk and not worth buying.</p>

<h5 id="for-10-of-the-average-price-of-a-256gb-card-this-won-t-work-out-well">For 10% of the average price of a 256GB card this won&rsquo;t work out well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is NOT a 256GB micro SD card for $20. That entire notion is beyond ridiculous.The only real legitimate 256GB micro SD cards on the market is run about $200 as of August 2016.Samsung has a few models in 256GB capacity. SanDisk has a 256GB micro SD card coming out shortly. It will also be in the $200 price tag range.This card costs a significantly lower percentage than the legitimate 256GB Samsung and SanDisk cards. And I do mean significant. This card runs 90% lower than the legitimate Samsung card. Super low prices almost always work out badly in the flash storage world because it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed to indicate that he card is a fake capacity.As of the date of this review, $20 will buy you a legitimate 64GB micro SD card from a reliable and reputable brand.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What happens is that fraudsters get cheap low speed low capacity cards and hack the control chip so a 4GB card reports itself as being a 128GB card to the computer/tablet/phone/camera etc. Your computer sees that information and displays 256GB of available storage so it tries to write 256GB of data to the card as it appears there is available storage space. But every time the actual amount of data exceeds the real capacity of the card, it starts overwriting the previous data. So what you get is a card that says it has 256GB worth of files on it, but those files are empty or badly corrupted. And your data is useless and unreadable.It&rsquo;s figuratively the same idea as putting a 10 gallon label on a 1 gallon bucket. You can pour 10 gallons of water into it, but when you&rsquo;re done the bucket is never going to have more than 1 gallon of water in it. And it won&rsquo;t just be the first gallon you poured in. It will be a mix of water from all 10 gallons. With putting 256GB of data on a 4GB card you will have a mix of data from all 256GB of your transfer and the 4GB of data that are stored on the card will just be an unusable mess.Real cards are labeled with the SD Association&rsquo;s classifications like SDXC. This card has none of that printed on the card, but it&rsquo;s claimed to be the case in the product title.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If you decide to buy this card anyway despite all this, do yourself a favor and test it as soon as it arrives to make sure it&rsquo;s a true 256GB capacity card. A thorough way to test it is with a utility app called &ldquo;h2testw&rdquo;. (For Mac users there is an alternative option called F3. It does basically the same thing. For Linux users&hellip;.if you get fooled by this flash storage scam you have no business using Linux) You can download both test apps free. Just do a search for it on any search engine and you&rsquo;ll find them. That app writes single bit data to the drive until it&rsquo;s full, then it reads that data back to make sure it&rsquo;s readable. It will tell you what the actual capacity of this disk is. The default language on that utility is German, but you can switch to English easily. This is smart to do even if you have no doubts that you have an authentic card. Sometimes things just go wrong in manufacturing and quality control and a dud gets through. An app like h2testw will verify that your legitimate card is working properly. And if it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;ll know right away while you are still in your 30 day exchange window.</p>
