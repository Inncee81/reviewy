<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-well-with-two-caveats">Works well &ndash; with two caveats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very satisfied with this purchase. I have cleaned maybe 75 records already, most of which were bought secondhand and graded G+, VG or VG+. I would say easily half of those if not more were improved enough to move them one step upward on the grading scale. Pops and crackles are reduced, often significantly, and the records come out nice and shiny, too. The old Discwasher brush kits don’t even come close to this.I do feel the need to address two misconceptions about this item.The first has to do with the label getting wet. If you fill the washer correctly (up to the fill line), a label will never be spun into the water, so you don’t ever have to worry about that. On the other hand, sometimes as the record is spun, water can drip off the half of the record that’s not in the water, down onto the label. I can’t imagine that this would do much damage to a label, especially if the water is wiped off quickly. However, if there is writing on the label, any ink present could absolutely smudge if it gets wet by water dripping off the top half of the record. I found this out the hard way.Secondly, you will see that most of the dirt, dust and lint cleaned off of your records will indeed settle to the bottom of the washer. However, after several records washed, enough of this dirt will remain suspended in the solution that I’m not comfortable agreeing with the other reviewers who say that after several washings you’re not getting even a tiny amount of junk back onto your record. Having cleaned 75 or so records, I’ve replaced the water in the tank three times already because the water just looked like it was too dirty to continue using. Now, I am 100% convinced that any record I’ve cleaned ends up in much better condition after the cleaning, regardless of what’s getting back onto the disc, and I can’t imagine that a small amount of dirt that might get back onto the record would cause much damage. Then again, I’m not a hardcore audiophile, and if you are then perhaps this isn’t the right record cleaner for you - for this reason. Otherwise, trust your eye, dump the water and refill when you see that it’s time, and continue.Oh, and you’ll probably need to pick up additional cleaning cloths, especially for marathon cleaning sessions. The two cloths provided with the set work fine but they will become saturated after maybe ten records each, and past that point you’re basically just pushing water around on the disc.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d rather have a $400 record cleaning machine. But, after using the kitchen sink and various brushes and rags, this makes things so much easier. The amazing part to me is how the label stays dry, yet it cleans right up close to the edge. The Spin Clean is just a big plastic reservoir, with brushes, and probably overpriced. It&rsquo;s all about efficiency, though. It will do a good job on all but the filthiest disks and it&rsquo;s idiot-proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="clean-records-happy-listening">Clean records = happy listening</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the process of cleaning my entire collection with this thing since I bought it. It&rsquo;s fantastic! You&rsquo;ll be surprised to find how much junk used to be on your records when you see the stuff sitting at the bottom of the reservoir after cleaning 20 or 30 disks. Get yourself a clean dish drying rack to put your records into air dry a bit after washing then follow up with the microfiber cloths.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="starter-and-finisher-record-washer-kit-all-you-need">Starter and Finisher Record Washer Kit&ndash;All you need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Terrific cleaner at a reasonable price. Much easier than hand washing and drying. The cleaning fluid does the job well and with a little persistence, I am able to revive almost any dirty disc: 33, 45, or 78. It is only a plastic tub with rollers and drying cloth, but it is a well designed tub. Each filled session can clean 20-30 albums. And, when you see what comes off the records, you will be eager to do this to every disc. Be sure to dry well, before playing. The liquid can gum up the stylus. But, anyone getting this is going to want to get a stylus cleaner, too! Well done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="effective-record-cleaner-at-a-good-price">Effective record cleaner at a good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In short, the Spin-Clean is superior to cleaning your records by hand, and you probably won&rsquo;t find any better device without spending significantly more money. It&rsquo;s not going to work any miracles; it can&rsquo;t fix scratches, scuff marks, or general wear and tear and degradation. Beat up dollar bin albums will not magically transform into diamonds in the rough. However, this WILL get a lot of gunk out of the grooves. Not only will you hear the difference, you&rsquo;ll see it in the wash basin after your cleaning session. On average, I&rsquo;ve found that a good cleaning with this contraption will get most VG albums to a VG+. Nothing extraordinary, just a good effective deep cleaning, and noticeably better than can be done with with the variety of hand held brushes on the market. Those don&rsquo;t get as deep in the grooves as the Spin-Clean. Fancy vacuum machines can almost certainly do better, but they will cost quite a bit more.I must reiterate a few points already made by other reviewers. First, it makes sense to set aside a few hours and clean a bunch of records at a time, maybe 35-50, otherwise you&rsquo;re wasting cleaning fluid and setup time. Second, the microfiber cloths that come with the Spin-Clean are not very good. Even after pre-washing I found that they were still shedding lint and thread on the records, which is counterproductive. Instead, get a cheap dish rack and let your records air dry. I&rsquo;ve found that to be my best result.Bottom line: if you have a lot of records and you&rsquo;d like to keep them in good playing shape, this is an effective and efficient way of cleaning them—more so than by hand—without spending a fortune on a vacuum machine.READ MORE</p>
