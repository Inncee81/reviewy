<h5 id="high-quality-kitchen-gadget">High Quality Kitchen Gadget!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I cook all the time. Not only do I prepare all of our meals from scratch due to family diet issues, but I have a large, organic garden and I preserve food from it all the time. I love food with flavor so I use lots of peppers, onions, ginger and garlic! I have worn out several garlic presses in my lifetime. The last one literally broke when I tried to press ginger into some water kefir. Tired of cheap crap, I got decided to find a quality garlic press. Noting the life time guarantee, I purchased the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press and Peeler Set about a year and a half ago and have been using it just about daily ever since for both garlic and ginger. It is fantastic!WHAT IS IN THE BOX: Beautifully presented in a lovely gift box, I received both the stainless steel garlic press plus a silicone tube garlic peeler.WHAT I LIKE: I have been using this garlic press for a year and a half and it looks as nice today as it did when I bought it. It shows absolutely no signs of wear.This press feels solid and durable in my hand. Use has proven it so.The stainless steel construction allows me to wash this in the dishwasher and I do. Every time I use it.The silicone garlic peeler is much nicer than I expected. Every year I make a couple of gallons of homemade salsa and peeling the garlic took forever in the past. I started using the silicone peeler for my garlic and it revolutionized my garlic peeling process. It works fast!Because I am no longer replacing my garlic press every couple of years, I will save money.This press works for ginger as well as garlic. I have used it with ginger a few times and there isnâ€™t the slightest bulge or bow where the garlic/ginger comes out.I am normally wary of rounded handles like this because they can hold water when washed. I have NEVER had any water issues with this press.WHAT I DONâ€™T LIKE: I love this garlic press. There is nothing I do not like.PICTURES: I am including various pictures of the press in my hand for a size reference. I have small hands. I also have a picture of the part that extrudes the garlic. It shows no signs of wear after a year and a half of constant use.I purchased the Alpha Grillers Garlic Press and Peeler Set at FULL PRICE. I love this set and highly recommend it. It definitely deserves 5 stars!</p>

<h5 id="nice-press">Nice press.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this press due to my frustration with trying to keep my old school press clean, it always seemed like I could dice the garlic by hand faster than cleaning the old press. And it never seemed to get really clean, there were always a few holes plugged no matter what I did.This one holds more, squishes easily and is a relative breeze to clean. I just swab it out and toss it in the dishwasher and it&rsquo;s all good.It comes in a fancy box too, I don&rsquo;t care about that personally but it would make for a cute gift.Overall a good product that I would recommend.</p>

<h5 id="top-5-reasons-to-buy-this-garlic-press">Top 5 Reasons to Buy this Garlic Press</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have just purchased my second Alpha Grillers Garlic Press; this one for a friend. I have owned a few presses in my time but this one, hands down is the best. Here are my reasons: #1 it is stainless so it doesn&rsquo;t smell like garlic after you wash it. #2 clean up is super easy - either hand wash or throw it in the dishwasher - just be sure to pick out the garlic skins first. #3 it&rsquo;s actually comfortable to press - my last press had &ldquo;square&rsquo;ish&rdquo; edges on the handle and I never realized how much I was struggling with it until I purchased this version. #4 it&rsquo;s worth every penny! In my opinion it is a great value and the rubber peeler that comes with it is quite useful. #5 The Seller is great! He contacts you to let you know your order is coming, sends separate directions on how to care for the press and then reaches back out after you have received it to ensure you&rsquo;re 100% satisfied. I know this isn&rsquo;t unique, but it is still appreciated, and above and beyond what many Sellers will do.Trust me, if I didn&rsquo;t love it, I wouldn&rsquo;t have bought a second one :-)</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-garlic-press">This is a great garlic press</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great garlic press. I cook meals on a daily basis, and I use a LOT of freshly minced garlic. This press is sturdy, and fits multiple cloves into the reservoir for pressing. The only feature of this product that I do not love is that the garlic sometimes gets stuck in the press. This makes it difficult to clean the press, but eventually will come clean with a little bit of TLC. Still, I highly recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tool">Great tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned many garlic presses, and I think this is an excellent tool. I find it does an excellent job and is easy to clean. It requires very little pressure to press a couple of peeled cloves. I like the company guarantee for life. The garlic peeler tool accessory is a nice inclusion because it allows you to peel the garlic by rolling it and this could come in handy if you want perfect, peeled cloves. Usually I just press the clove with the side of a knife and quickly peel it, but the peeler is good for two reasons&ndash;the garlic clove is whole and you do not pick up the scent of garlic on your hands. Raw garlic is pungent, and the oils will be absorbed into your skin, along with the odor, unless you wear gloves. A garlic press is a very fast way to mince garlic and the peeler does help if you want to use a whole clove, slice the garlic or chop it. I am happy with the set.</p>

<h5 id="strong-sturdy-durable">Strong, Sturdy, Durable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great press. I bought mine in July 2014 when it was listed as a &ldquo;launch&rdquo; product. Now, nearly 3 years later it is still as sturdy as the day I bought it. I was concerned with it being a launch product that I could be buying some inferior product that would bend or break in a short period of time but that has not been the case. This is a great tool and I&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone. The only reason I&rsquo;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel there should be some way to make the handles a little more ergonomic besides having two straight steel handles. With that aside: works great, very sturdy, still shiny, with only a few minor scratches - as should be expected after 3 years of use.</p>

<h5 id="very-difficult-to-clean">Very difficult to clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m doing it wrong, but so far this garlic press is very difficult to clean. There are two slits on either side of the trap where you put the garlic, and the pulp gets&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife is very pleased with this press. She had been using a Pampered Chef that was starting to leave small pieces of metal in the pressed garlic. Easy to use, easy to clean.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-impressed">I&rsquo;m impressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The press is very well built and sturdy. It works flawlessly as does the peeler. I am also very pleased with Alpha Grillers.</p>
