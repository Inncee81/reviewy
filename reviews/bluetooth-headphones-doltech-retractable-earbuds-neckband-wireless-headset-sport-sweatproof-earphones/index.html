<h5 id="best-combo-of-sound-clarity-design-and-battery-life">Best combo of sound, clarity, design,and battery life!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a number of Bluetooth headphones as it is really hard to get a good one in the under $50 range. They are either ok sounding, comfortable, good battery life, and use on phone calls!This one pretty much gets high marks on all a headphone like this is meant to do!First the setup:Bluetooth function: super easy to pair! Find it on your Bluetooth screen, select, and you are in business!Next the performance with music:Put my phone in one end of the house, walked at least 30 feet away, and sound was still very clear through wall.Sound is REALLY good! I mean, really really good! EDM, Bossa Nova, guitar instrumentals, rap, techno, disco, etc. At first it was bass heavy, which I was ok with. After reading the direction (yes, duh, read the manual), I found out that there are some cool features like even changing the eq. Double-click the &ldquo;-&rdquo; button and you can go from bass-enhanced, normal, and treble enhanced. These eq&rsquo;s (even though a little limited, definitely improve the listening experience. You can also adjust your eq on your phone to get it to your perfect setting.Now for the part I don&rsquo;t use most since I am more or using this for music&hellip; The phone calls! These are super clear, both from the caller end and the receiving end! REALLY clear! My wife couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference then I was using it and when I was using just my regular phone. I even left a voicemail at my work phone and both sounded the same to me. This was the most impressive piece for me since I rarely use these headsets for phone calls as it tends to be &ldquo;hit-or-miss&rdquo;. Now I am definitely using these for those long conference calls. I would recommend! </p>

<h5 id="headphones">Headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I just recieved the Doltech headphones today and I really enjoyed it! The headphones are lightweight, comfortable and have a long battery life. I would recommend it to anyone!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="clear-sound-and-easy-to-pair">Clear sound and easy to pair</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided on this pair because of the look and the design.I&rsquo;m so happy I made a good choice.It has a great noise cancellation effect. The sound is crystal clear, the tress and bass are separately clear. Great volume. It is very light weight which makes it perfect for jogging, work out at the gym or while sitting. The best thing is it does not have long cord that I have to worry about to cling on to something else when I move. Easy to pair with apple or android phones and iPad after I read the instruction.Highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-easy-to-use-very-functional">Excellent Product - Easy to Use - Very Functional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The headphones are lightweight and flexible and should fit nicely around many different neck sizes. I&rsquo;m on the smaller size and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to overpower me. I tend to use only one of the ear pieces at a time (as California only allows one at a time while driving) and I will say that the sound quality is plenty loud and clear using just one. My callers tell me that the sound quality on the opposite end is very clear as well and that they can hear me as well as if I am sitting right next to them. The earpiece expands and retracts cleanly from the headset and does not bounce around even when I forget to put the wire back into the holding place. This is a very nice product - I am very pleased.</p>

<h5 id="love-that-i-no-longer-have-to-carry-my-phone">Love that I no longer have to carry my phone &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love that I no longer have to carry my phone all around the house. The sound is clear. My husband didn&rsquo;t even know he was talking to me on headphones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bluetooth-headphones-doltech-retractable">Bluetooth Headphones DolTech Retractable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bluetooth Headphones DolTech Retractable are wonderful! I had not used headphones before, but going to the gym regularly, I saw someone else using headphones and decided I must get a set! I am delighted! They are very comfortable sitting on my neck and the clarity of sound tracks is fantastic! I am very pleased with my purchase!The only frustration I found, was the diagram of the headphones buttons in the manual; the diagrams are so faint, even with a magnifying glass, it is extremely hard to decipher!Definitely would purchase again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-headphones-for-the-price">Great headphones for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these for gym use. I love them! The volume and skip track options are so easy to use. Setting up the bluetooth works perfectly. The retractable function is very useful! My husband is so jealous I had to buy a pair for him!Update 7/5/17 still loving these headphones. I bought a pair for my husband and the company responded super fast when there was an issue with the order. They shipped out a new pair real fast. They also always respond to messages very quickly. Thanks again!</p>

<h5 id="these-headphones-are-really-great">These headphones are really great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These headphones are really great.I&rsquo;ve bounced around from a lot of different types, sizes, shapes, and colors.I finally bought these and I am glad I made the best choice.These headphones can go fairly deep into your ear.This is good for multiple reasons such as filtering out noise and better bass.Not only the soud quality is good,they can also compatible with my iphone easily.They are pretty lightweight which makes them nice to use while you&rsquo;re on a walk or on a long road trip.Worth the money I paid and I will buy another one for my husband.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-sure-about-battery-life">Not sure about battery life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The headset is comfortable to wear. I fully charged the battery before using it. I don&rsquo;t think the battery last as long as the packaging stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-save-your-money-for-quality">Do not buy, save your money for quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could give this negative stars, I would! One earbud shorted out, then the other did the next day. They lasted exactly 1 month and three days. Complete waste of $$$.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-convenient">Comfortable &amp; convenient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best combo of cute &amp; convenient! The neck piece is really light and comfortable to wear - I pretty much forget that it&rsquo;s there when I&rsquo;m using it.</p>
