<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<ul>
<li>CONVENIENT OPEN FACE DESIGN: Stop fighting with cheap armbands that have vinyl plastic covering the screen which can make accessing your device’s screen more difficult. AB1 features completely open &amp; easy access to your device’s screen. AB1 also provides easy access to your device’s other important features, such as the headphone jack, volume, power &amp; home buttons. Please NOTE: To minimize sweat intrusion into the silicone case, AB1 covers the camera &amp; proximity sensor.</li>
<li><em>This armband is not waterproof due to the open face design.</em></li>
<li>SECURE: Our thick, strong &amp; flexible Silicone Rubber Skin is custom molded to fit your device precisely &amp; will keep your device secure even during the most vigorous workouts. Silicone is deceptively strong so you can be confident your device will not fall out. *Make sure to remove your device from its case prior to installing in the Silicone Skin.</li>
<li>STAYS PUT: High quality soft Elastic trap allows you to workout in comfort. Since the strap stretches, you can flex &amp; relax your arm without worrying about the strap sliding. Strong Velcro keeps the strap at the level of tightness you choose.</li>

<li><p>STRAP SIZE: Elastic Velcro strap comfortably fits small arms (9&rdquo;) to large arms (21&rdquo;). If you have any trouble sizing your new armband to fit your arm perfectly, call, Email or visit our YouTube channel, Mediabridge™USA, for simple visual instructions.</p>

<p>Color:iPod Nano 7th/8th Generation Armband Black
Mediabridge™ Sport Armband</p>

<p>A safe &amp; effective solution for carrying your device/listening to music while you exercise. Access your device’s essential buttons &amp; features, while providing a protective skin for workouts. A soft &amp; breathable elastic Velcro strap fits arm sizes 9”-21”. The snug-fitting silicone can also act as a standalone case.</p>

<p>Product Features
- Silicone case for carrying your device during workouts
- Elastic Velcro strap fits a variety of arm sizes
- Access device buttons/features
- Insert/remove a device quickly
- Hand-washable</p>

<p>Compatibility
- Case fits the iPod Nano 7th &amp; 8th Generation (without a case)
- Strap fits 9&rdquo;-21&rdquo; arm circumferences</p>

<p>Installation
Place a device in the case, adjust the strap like a belt on your arm &amp; secure it with the Velcro</p>

<p>Notes
- Our customers have told us that unobstructed access to the touch screen controls on their device was a highly sought after feature when choosing a sport armband. To accommodate this feature, we’ve designed this case to have an open face that allows for instant access to the touch screen controls, while at the same time providing a case that will hold the device securely. While an open face design allows for unobstructed access to the touch screen controls, extra care should taken if you expect to use this armband in a wet environment as follows:
*This armband is not waterproof and will not protect your device in the rain
*Users that may experience excessive sweating during exercise should consider whether a waterproof armband might be more appropriate for their particular use</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fulfilled-all-expectations">Fulfilled all expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since this was one of the cheaper armbands I was skeptical until I had it. But although simple it works very well and the detachable band makes it great to use as a protection when carrying the iPod in a bag. It wears comfortable and I don&rsquo;t feel it while running. So 5 stars for price performance ratio.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-armband-i-ve-tried-others-and-only-wish-i-found-this-first">Best armband - I&rsquo;ve tried others and only wish I found this first!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this armband! I tried many others before finding this one. I like that it does not cover the screen of the iPod. Other armbands I tried had covers to protect against rain, but the iPod covers made the screen unusable. iPods are water proof to an extent, so a little rain or sweat won&rsquo;t hurt them. The band itself is nice. It&rsquo;s highly adjustable to fit any size arm. It&rsquo;s very supportive and durable and keeps the iPod from shifting during a run. Where I secure the band is where it stays. I also wash the band (not with iPod or iPod case cover) occasionally and it still looks/works like new. The price is also great compared to others on the market. I highly recommend this product!</p>

<h5 id="yup">Yup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for runners. I actually use it like a bracelet on my wrist. I lost my last ipod. I will definitely never lose this one now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-for-running-but-doesn-t-protect-from-sweat">Works well for running but doesn&rsquo;t protect from sweat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I each have one of these. They work well for what they need to do. I barely notice I have it on when I&rsquo;m running. The strap is comfortable and doesn&rsquo;t rub my skin. The iPod stays generally still and where I want it. I can still use the buttons but the sleep/wake button is a little difficult because there is a small gap between the case and the button. It&rsquo;s like this on both of the cases we have but I can still press the button mid run. Overall is does exactly what I want and is easy to use. There is no screen protection so you might consider buying a screen protector separately.Update: I&rsquo;ve now used this for over a year and I&rsquo;ve found a new issue. Since the back of the iPod case is open to allow the strap to run through it any sweat goes straight to the iPod. I didn&rsquo;t realize this for a few month until I pulled the iPod out of the case. The sweat (or likely the salt in it) eroded the case of the iPod until the battery finally stopped working. Luckily Apple was will to cover it under the warranty but now I have to take the iPod out after every run to wipe it off and let it dry. If you sweat much at all I don&rsquo;t recommend this strap unless you want to remove the iPod after each run. I changed the rating to 3 stars because of this.Update 2: I just replaced my second iPod after the newest one also stopped working correctly. Once again the sweat was able to creep into the headphone jack and it stopped playing music on the left side. After I replaced my last iPod I started taking it out of the armband after each run and wiping it dry and letting it air out. I thought this might be enough to allow me to continue to use the armband. Luckily apple quickly replaced it but I need to find a new armband. Obviously this will be a recurring issue.</p>

<h5 id="nice-armband-for-the-buck">Nice Armband for the Buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Read a few reviews on Amazon, bought this armband to replace one I liked very much that was no longer available. The positive points are: It is light weight so it doesn&rsquo;t hamper your movement as you exercise. The one I bought is not clear like this one, it&rsquo;s translucent so you cannot see the color of your Nano clearly. If that is a nonissue then you are good to go.The nano is protect around the edges with the silicone, the front of it naturally is open so you can use the touch screen clearly. The silicone is flexible enough so the power on/off switch is easy to use.The nano case has slots that the strap runs threw, allowing you to adjust the strap to your arm size. The front of the NANO is unprotected so you will want to order a packet of The 16&rdquo; strap stretches and uses velcro to secure it in place.The 16&rdquo; strap is expandable to a fairly large circumference. If you are a petite lady you might have more strap than you need.What they say about the product:CONVENIENT: A durably safe &amp; effective solution for carrying your Nano &amp; listening to music while you exercise.SECURE: Manufactured from strong, yet pliable silicone, &amp; designed to endure extended workout sessions. It has been rigorously tested &amp; will keep your Nano from falling out during workouts.OPEN DESIGN: Open &amp; easy access to your phone&rsquo;s screen, headphone jack, volume buttons, camera &amp; power button. NOTE: This armband is not water-proof due to the open design.COMFORTABLE: Soft Elastic Velcro strap comfortably fits small arms (9&rdquo;) to large arms (21&rdquo;). See YouTube Channel: MediabridgeUSA for help sizing the armband.</p>

<h5 id="just-one-concern">&hellip;just one concern&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good armband for newest iPod Nano. Fits Nano perfectly, allows for easy access to screen and buttons. My ONLY complaint: opening for earbud cable was too tight, not allowing connector to go in all the way. I had to trim just a bit of the case, making the opening bigger. Works fine now, just disappointed that I had to take a razor blade to my brand new case(s). (My wife got one too).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been searching for this simple and effective product &ldquo;FOREVER!&rdquo;. I have been working out with my iPOD for years, and have never had an armband that I love more. It took this company the sense to realize and say, &ldquo;Why take an aesthetically simple piece of tech, and house it in an overly complicated, garish case?&rdquo; Simple is better. Simple is beautiful. Simple is efficient. This company does simple brilliantly!</p>

<h5 id="will-be-purchasing-more">Will be purchasing more</h5>

<p>Love this product. Honestly it&rsquo;s great. I have gone through several arm bands from different manufacturers, this one is by far my favorite. The Velcro works nicely and it doesn&rsquo;t fall off while doing pull-ups. Very comfortable design. Can&rsquo;t beat it for the price either.</p>
