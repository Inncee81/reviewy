<blockquote>
<p>First of all, i&rsquo;d like to start by debunking some other reviews claims here. This PC is certainly not the top-of-the-line available right now. You are not paying $1500.00+ and therefore you will not get a PC that is going to function as such. A lot of people seem upset that they are not getting something that is worth $1500.00 for $500.00 USD. That is just not realistic. But this computer is, in my opinion, worth the $500.00 spent on it.While I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself an expert, I know a bit about computers and building desktops. Both my gaming PC and my significant other&rsquo;s gaming PC come from CyberpowerPC&rsquo;s custom build site- not through Amazon or any other store/location. I have been on computers since the 90&rsquo;s, tinkering and gaming. My significant other worked for Gateway- building and repairing PC&rsquo;s, and has been a PC tech for well over 15 years. We spent well over $1200 on each of those setups and both of them can play &ldquo;AAA titles&rdquo; as well as other games that are just very taxing on memory or other components. THIS SETUP IS NOT ONE OF THOSE, OBVIOUSLY. But read on and i&rsquo;ll tell you more about this tower.I purchased this PC here, a CyberpowerPC pre-built tower, as a work computer. Yep, a work computer. With some light gaming on the side in my free time. And to use when friends come over and i&rsquo;m not working- they will be able to play some games with me and my significant other, surf the web, etc. Most of the time when I have friends over and we want to play games, we&rsquo;re limited to what few consoles and games we have. I don&rsquo;t care for consoles as much as PC gaming so this will be a nice option.This desktop arrived in great shape- nothing wrong with it upon first, second, third, even fourth use. It&rsquo;s your best-bang-for-your-buck entry-level gaming PC.Out of the box, this comes with all discs, manuals, inserts- there&rsquo;s also the Windows key nicely and neatly placed on the side of the unit. Also comes with a keyboard and mouse combo- I chose not to use these as I have several others I prefer to use, however, they look to be a great option for someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a personal preference to another keyboard or mouse, and they are definitely modern and &ldquo;gamey&rdquo; looking. Computer lights up blue internally, looks very flashy (though it doesn&rsquo;t actually flash, don&rsquo;t get that confused-) and &ldquo;high-tech.&rdquo; Mouse has several excess buttons to assign or use as you&rsquo;d like through your gaming ventures. Keyboard has highlighted WASD and directional keys- they are red- so you can find your &ldquo;home keys&rdquo; easier and pay more attention to the screen, if you&rsquo;re less familiar with the keyboard layout. Also comes with power cord, obviously for, power to the PC.THIS WILL NOT come with any cords needed for monitors- desktop setups and towers do not come with those- ever- unless you&rsquo;re purchasing WITH a monitor in the package- if you purchase a monitor it should come with the cables you need- if it doesn&rsquo;t, I know you can search up the one you need on Amazon and they are really quite cheap nowadays. I opted not to purchase with the monitor for an additional several hundred dollars, because I had an extra monitor laying around that was not being used. This computer does have HDMI/DVI/VGA hookups.Addressing the issues with the power supply everyone seems to be asking or complaining about. I don&rsquo;t see the issue- maybe it was something that was addressed by CyberpowerPC prior to my purchase- i&rsquo;m not really sure. But the 500 watt power supply that comes with this machine, as of right now, late October 2016, is fine for the card that is in the machine. If you are upgrading parts, that is when you&rsquo;ll need to consider upgrading the power supply.Okay. So now on to more of the performance. I have set this computer up for use, and from the minute you turn on the PC it&rsquo;s quite a simple walkthrough. The fan sound is a little loud to start but the case is very open so it could just be lack of a noise barrier. Plug everything in as per instructions and you&rsquo;ll have an easy walkthrough of Windows 10. It&rsquo;s kind of foolproof. Takes maybe 10 minutes, provided you have an internet connection established, and you&rsquo;re all set. This computer does NOT HAVE WIFI CAPABILITY WITHOUT A WIFI DONGLE/USB ATTACHMENT. I personally prefer having it wired in, myself, so I set up a 100-ft cable to run from my computer/gaming room to the front office through my attic. Small hole in one corner by the door, up and through, and down through another small hole. Easy-peasy, neat and hidden.I installed Steam, Teamspeak 3, Firefox/Chrome, and many other programs right off the bat.I installed and opened up several games to see how they&rsquo;d run. Most of the games I play, are not the absolutely new games- I love games like Path of Exile, ARK: Survival Evolved, Van Helsing 1-4, other RPGs and adventure games. Orcs must Die is always fun. DmC. The Sims 3. Star Trek Online. Marvel Heroes 2016. A lot of different game titles- just to draw you a picture of what I like. Most of the games I would play seem to run well on medium graphics so far. Ark is pretty taxing, so I needed to get a good boost from Game Booster 3 and playing it in low memory mode and I can run it. (When I want to run a game I WILL find a way to run it! LOL.) I don&rsquo;t play on very populated servers though so I couldn&rsquo;t tell you how it works on a server from Australia with 40 people on it. I&rsquo;m in Florida, USA, and we have our own server hosted in Canada with a handful of people playing regularly. My net up/down speed is approximately <sup>115</sup>&frasl;<sub>110</sub>. Just to give you an idea. If you don&rsquo;t understand all that just refer back to the beginning of the paragraph. This will not play newer games on high graphics settings and you won&rsquo;t get very good frame rate on newer games. But older games will play decently.I don&rsquo;t play Battlefield, CS, or CoD don&rsquo;t ask me about any of those.I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say this computer is THE best gaming computer. Simply put, you are paying $500.00 for a computer. You&rsquo;re not paying $1500.00. This will not be the top of the line rig. However. For the money you pay, for a pre-built desktop tower and keyboard/mouse combo, you are getting a good deal.Several other buyers seem to have gotten duds, (lemons,) or dead on arrival towers. That can be frustrating, but, I mean, it happens- one time I got a computer tower sent out and the graphics card was a lemon- can&rsquo;t blame the guy who put the PC together they test them thoroughly before sending them out- lemons can show what they are even a month into use. Several other buyers still even seem to think that for $500.00 you should get a top of the line PC. In an ideal world, sure, that&rsquo;s the way it would be. This is 2016. In reality, for $500.00 this is what you get and it runs well considering.CyberpowerPC, so long as your purchase is through them and not a third party, will provide you with lifetime tech support and one year parts and labor warranty. I have dealt with them on multiple occasions thus far, not anything to do with this PC tower. This tower arrived in working condition, and so far I am very satisfied with how well it works, though I have only had it less than a week, so we will see (and I will update as necessary.) CyberpowerPC&rsquo;s staff are always courteous and they are very happy to help.If you have any questions about the product before purchasing, or even after, post them to the &ldquo;ask the community&rdquo; section of the page, or feel free to comment on my review i&rsquo;ll try to take the time to respond and help you out, if I didn&rsquo;t address the issue of concern in my review. I can&rsquo;t promise a reply but I will try my best. Hope this helped influence your decision on whether or not to purchase this PC. If it sounds like a fit for you, go for it. If not, maybe opt to save a little more money up until you can purchase what you are looking for. Highly recommend CyberpowerPC though, as I said I now have 3 computer towers through them and thus far have not had bad experiences. If you do opt to go directly through them, talk to Justin S. He&rsquo;s the only person i&rsquo;d speak to there and has been super helpful with our purchases in the past.</p>

<p>LITERELLY the only ONE bad thing about THIS and all other CyberpowerPC&rsquo;s is the Power Supply, Replace it ASAP, Video here: <a href="http://youtu.be/XO8879sR1ycHello">http://youtu.be/XO8879sR1ycHello</a> and First of all i want to say that this computer is extremely &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; looking and is low priced gaming computer for around $500 dollars for any entry level Gamer and IF YOURE INTERESTED IN BUYING THEN CONTINUE READING. I was overall satisfied when receiving this package and will be doing a full review on this pc on youtube from the unboxing to any upgrades/failure that occur,hopefully no failures.Lets start of with the SHIPPING: I bought this PC on November 16,2013 at around 4:00 Pm Pacific Time. I choose the two day shipping option after signing up for amazon Prime 30 day trial. Initially my Pc was going to be deliverd on Tuesday November 19,2013, but UPS delivered it one day early on Monday. It arrived in a huge box that was around 5-6 ft long by 3-4 ft wide. Inside that box was the white Cyberpowerpc box(You see in many Unboxings including mine) surrounded by cardboard paper packaging. Inside the Cyberpowerpc box came the PC box itself with the keyboard, mouse, Drivers/manuals(inside the Graphics card box). which was neatly packed to fit.Overall came in good packaging.PC COMPONENTS: The Pc itself comes with a VERY, VERY.VERY, crappy power supply which should be instantly exchanged out with something decent. All the bad reviews on Cyberpowerpc are because of the power supply failing and damaging the components inside of the computer. Now the Pc comes with a low end graphics card that can stay inside the pc for light gaming, but like the Powersupply, I recommend Upgrading. The Motherboard itself is a bit small but looks decent while the CPU fan looks and runs really smooth. The hard drive inside the pc has one terabyte of memory,but beware that you won&rsquo;t get the full 1024 gigabytes,I myself came up on close to 950 GB. The DVD drive isn&rsquo;t a major brand but it works fine.&gt; Great &ldquo;Bang for the Buck&rdquo;: For all of the Components inside of the Computer, it is still a better buy, then if you would add up all of the components and build one yourself, Not even counting that it is &ldquo;Professionally&rdquo; assembled. Yes I agree that it is Definitily better to build one yourself but, If you build one yourself with all of the exact components Inside this computer you would end up paying more or less $568.08 before taxes. My recommendation is to buy this computer when it is below $550 since it would be a great deal in my perspective.&gt; With 8GB of DDR3 Ram, the need for more Ram Greatly Decreases as 8GB of DDR3 Ram is sufficient to cover your moderate gaming needs.&gt; The Pc Comes with a Quad-Core processor at 3.8 GHz, that is one good processor that will run any task you throw at it smothly and without any hiccups&gt; It comes with a One Terabye Hard drive that will most definitively suit your storage hoarding habits.<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> READ THIS: My computer came in with a 2.8 GHZ processor when it is clearly advertised for a 3.8 GHZ processor. Beware when booting this computer up, check all of the system settings to make sure that everything you payed for is there. called Amazon customer service and the customer associate was very helpful in finding a solution instantly to the problem with my PC. I will be receiving the replacement on Friday 11/22/13 and it is 11/21/13 today so she was nice enough to offer one day shipping since it will probably ship tomorrow morning (<sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub>).<strong>EDIT</strong> I received a replacement computer (2nd pc) because my first one came with a 2.8 Ghz processor. I am very disappointed Amazon Advertises a 3.8 Ghz when i received, not only one 2.8 Ghz pc but two 2.8 Ghz processor computers.I called Amazon Customer service and they wanted to give me a full refund of 14 months of money that i had to save up just so they could take away my computer and leave me alone with my dedicated money saving on the ground, BEWARE check all of your specs when buying this, and any computer online. I spoke to a Supervisor and they said they would take a look into the inventory at the warehouse and &ldquo;test&rdquo; the resting computers to see what the problem was. I smell False Advertisement, and/or two mistakes in their part, all i asked amazon for was a 3rd replacement pc that actually comes with a 3.8 Ghz processor but with no extra cost to me since i clearly payed for a 3.8 Ghz, I was denied multiple times by 3 different associates before asking for the supervisor. Im currently waiting on word from the supervisor if or not they do indeed have 3.8 Ghz processors in their warehouse.<strong>EDIT</strong> I have received a 3rd replacement Pc and i have to say that i did not have a good feeling about it but, in the end it did come out to have a 3.8 GHz Processor. To begin The &ldquo;correct&rdquo; Pc (3.8GHZ) comes with a Cooler Master CPU Fan and a similiar but smaller Motherboard compared to the one I originally recieved. I will have a video on youtube ASAP(12/12/13 todays date) demonstrating the correct Pc that you will be recieving with the 3.8 GHz Processor.More to come.. i will further use/test the pc itself to continue this review. I will be uploading review videos on my youtube channel to help inform the general audience interested in this computer and help you make a decision on wether to buy this computer or not. My name on Youtube is &ldquo;longohouler13&rdquo; and i already have the unboxing video up, you can simply copy and paste this on youtube, &ldquo; longohouler13 cyberpowerpc &ldquo;. I want to show you guys a personal review, that way you are more informed to what you will be buying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This PC is a replacement for my Dell XPS 630 that has done me well for a very long time, but it was time to retire that bad boy. I mainly play CSGO and was only getting between 20 to 30 FPS&hellip;well, I just received the CyberpowerPC today, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I know it&rsquo;s on the low end side of gaming PC&rsquo;s as far as the price is concerned, but it rocks!! I&rsquo;m now getting FPS between 130 and 160 and it&rsquo;s remaining steady&hellip;does not fall below 130. I have not used the keyboard or mouse provided as I already have a nice setup with a Razor combo. I honestly don&rsquo;t think you can get a better gaming machine pre-built than the GUA3400A! I mean $550 bucks, get real. I can blow that in a week going out with my friends on the town.I also read a previous review stating that this model does not come with the Radeon R7 250 as stated in it&rsquo;s description, and is instead coming with the R7 200&hellip;I&rsquo;m not saying he didn&rsquo;t get a 200 in his, but mine came with 250 as stated in it&rsquo;s description.One suggestion before turning it on&hellip;there is a plastic sheet covering the side vents on the INSIDE of the case&hellip;it does explain that on the quick setup guide, but I know there are some out there who will be so excited to get this bad boy rocking that they won&rsquo;t even read the information provided by Cyberpower.Shipping was fast&hellip;as I ordered it on Saturday and got it today. (Monday) It was packaged very well in two boxes with two large pieces of foam in between those two boxes.I will update my review in the weeks and months to come as needed.</p>
