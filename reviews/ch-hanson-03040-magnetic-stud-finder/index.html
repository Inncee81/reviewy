<h5 id="this-unit-a-piece-of-string-remarkably-accurate-and-dirt-cheap">This unit + a piece of string = remarkably accurate and dirt-cheap.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is effective, though it must be stressed that you have to be very sensitive when using this in certain situations.I was very disappointed the first 10 minutes I tried in vain to use this by sweeping it by hand across various walls. I couldn&rsquo;t detect anything that I was comfortable assuming was a stud nail, let alone drilling a hole in my wall based on that assumption.HOWEVER: I found it far easier to hang the device with a simple piece of thread and then just swinging it along the wall. Do not touch the finder with your hands at all.With a string added, it jumped right to the stud nails when I came anywhere close to them. The difference between the two methods is like night and day.It&rsquo;s a simple way to increase the sensitivity and efficiency of this product.To anyone disappointed, give it a shot!</p>

<h5 id="works-as-promised-but-very-small-so-you-have-to-work-extra">Works as promised, but very small, so you have to work extra.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stud finder works exactly as it is supposed to. It is so strong the it can suck magnets often be referred greater from almost 2&rdquo; away. It works perfectly through extra thick plaster and paint over the dry wall. However because of its small size that means it has a very small footprint also. You almost have to swipe it across the wall as if you were frosting a cake or mowing a lawn. When you do find a nail it is unmistakable that you found it. I have used to message to find nails. The 1st is to hang it from a string in just pass the string along the wall to let the stud finder drag on the surface of the wall and it will stick hard when it finds a nail. The 2nd is to cup it loosely in your hand and pass your hand back-and-forth across the wall until it suddenly grabs hold.The packaging is anything but frustration free and is the old school piece of double-layered plastic molding sandwich between sheets of chipboard/cardboard. Notice in my photo the it is not much taller than a standard size toothpick. See that the entire package is much smaller than the A1 size box, Amazon&rsquo;s smallest box.Over all, does it work? Yes, exactly as advertised and as a perfect backup if you don&rsquo;t want to require batteries. Would I get it for a job site? Absolutely not. Its small size and therefore small footprint makes it too cumbersome to try to use for more then figuring out where to mount something at home. For the home user that May only occasionly have to figure out where the studs are, it is perfect because it can also double as a refrigerator magnet due to its smaller size. Additional note regarding the refrigerator usage: When this thing gets within about 2&rdquo; of the refrigerator it will jump out of your hand in clean hard. It requires a decent amount of skoal to get it back-off. We have a calendar held to the refrigerator with 3 clip magnets. This stud finder was powerful enough to not only grab the 1st magnet from an inch away, but also pull the other 2 from the refrigerator and hold the calendar in the air while carrying it to another room and passing it through the door.Usage tip: Once you find the 1st stud, have a tape measure extended several feet and let the magnets of the stud finder hold the extended end of the tape as you hold the base end. Now mark every 16 or 24&rdquo; to figure out approximately where to check for other studs&rsquo; exact locations. This will make finding studs a little easier.Hint (for those without access to ask a good carpenter / inspector): An easy way to figure out your stud placement is to find the stud nearest the corner of a Room. (Avoid corners with windows or doors nearby, or corners of the house, as this may cause design layout to vary.) Measure either 16 or 24&rdquo; (most common), and that will be your base measurement to expect in the rest of your house. Also note that exterior walls may have different / closer stud placement and distance than interior walls.Remember: Building code changes with time or materials used or location of wall. Keep that in mind when checking different parts of your home.{Professionals, please don&rsquo;t read this next part.} The quality of work or extra decisions of carpenters impacts placement. (I&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;the studs are an average of 24 inches&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as long as they&rsquo;re somewhere closer than 16 inches we&rsquo;re fine&rdquo;, plus what looks like &ldquo;We&rsquo;re putting the door / window / outlet right here and that&rsquo;s final! Throw in some extra boards if it doesn&rsquo;t line up with the studs properly. It will be extra solid then, so it&rsquo;s no big deal if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense!&rdquo;) Also, metal doesn&rsquo;t always mean stud. (&ldquo;Oops! Didn&rsquo;t measure that cut right / cut isn&rsquo;t smooth / didn&rsquo;t place the drywall correctly. But we can just patch it with sheet metal.&rdquo;)+ Measure twice, cut once. This way you don&rsquo;t make mistakes.- Cut once and measure twice. That way you&rsquo;ll know how badly off you were and then finally get a rough idea of how you need to guess better next time.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-electronic">Better Than Electronic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an electronic stud finder that cost several times much as this one. The problem with the electronic stud finder is that you have to mess around calibrating it on an open space, even then you get occasional false positives because of changes in material like extra wallpaper extra or less insulation. In other words; any changes in material from where you calibrated your stud finder can cause a false or vague reading. The CH Hanson stud finder has very strong rare earth magnets that absolutely grab onto the very nails your builder used to attach the sheetrock to the studs. The magnets are strong enough to hold the stud finder on the wall while you make your markings or measure to the next stud (usually 16&rdquo;).. Surprisingly this somewhat low tech method is faster, easier and more reliable than my electronic stud finder. (Starts with a Z}</p>

<h5 id="drill-with-confidence">Drill with Confidence</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this thing! I paired it with my electric stud finder and I was able to drill with confidence. Didn&rsquo;t miss a single stud and got the job done quickly and smoothly. Have to say without this it would not have gone down that way. I also like the fact that you can use it as a guide while drilling without having to pencil line your walls. Just move it up to the nail above or below your drill spot and it magnetizes to the wall giving you a dang good center point. Again, paired with the electric finder you can make sure the guy/gal nailing in your dry wall was hitting center. Would recommend to anybody.</p>

<h5 id="would-recommend-it-over-most-stud-finders-that-cost-10-times-as-much">Would recommend it over most stud finders that cost 10 times as much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little I can say about this little device that hasn&rsquo;t already been said a hundred or more times. I personally own a Zircon 65244 stud finder that cost around two hundred dollars when I bought it. One of our electricians has a Dewalt Wall Scanner that cost him over four hundred dollars and nearly everyone I work with has a variation of the twenty dollar Stud Sensor HD55, but outside of the Dewalt Wall Scanner, which does do more than just find studs, I wouldn&rsquo;t say any of the others are any better as this little magnetic stud finder. It&rsquo;s not quite as good as the Wall Scanner, which can tell me if the metal behind the wall is a nail/screw/metal box, but that also goes into using a little common sense with this magnetic stud finder. You know, if you&rsquo;re getting a magnetic pull in a square area of about 15x15 it&rsquo;s not just a screw or nail! Having a little fun there at my own expense after I tried to drive a screw into an old metal box mounted behind a wall for support for a large medicine cabinet. It works well and more importantly to me, it fits in my multi-tool case with the multi-tool making it much easier to find when I need it.</p>
