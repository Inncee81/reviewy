<p>style:VideoMicro
Designed to improve the audio quality of your videos, the compact Video Micro microphone captures every sound with pristine clarity. It incorporates a high-quality cardioid condenser microphone capsule for great quality audio recordings when used with a wide range of cameras. A directional microphone, the Video Micro reduces distracting peripheral sounds and focusses on the audio in front of the camera. Its pickup is more forgiving than RØDE&rsquo;s other on-camera microphones providing a more natural sound when recording indoors. Perfect for capturing incredible audio to accompany inspiring vision. The microphone body is made from aluminum, giving it a high level of RF rejection, and is finished in RØDE&rsquo;s high-grade ceramic anti-glare black coating. Included with the Video Micro is a camera shoe mount featuring a Rycote Lyre shock mount. Featuring a suspension structure composed of a hard-wearing thermoplastic, it is far more effective at minimizing unwanted vibrations, handling and cable-borne noise than traditional elastic suspensions. Virtually indestructible, the Rycote Lyre will never sag, snap, wear out or require rethreading to maintain its effectiveness. Also included is the WS9 synthetic furry wind shield with foam inner cell, designed for use in outdoor scenarios where wind and environmental noise can inhibit recordings. Optionally available is the RØDE SC7, a TRS to TRRS cable that allows the Video Micro to be used with smartphones, to capture crystal clear, directional sound for video and video applications such as Periscope.</p>

<h5 id="rode-videomic-me-shotgun-mic-review">Rode VideoMic Me Shotgun Mic Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Recording video or audio with an iPhone or other smart device has become the norm. Why not take better video or snapchat audio? You already have a great built in camera, so now we just need better audio. Thats where the Rode VideoMic Me comes in.It&rsquo;s a directional shotgun mic that is easy to use and set up. And it&rsquo;s passive, which means no batteries. While this may be a drawback for the more pro-user, the lack of battery or power may be better for the regular everyday user. With quality construction, it&rsquo;s built pretty tough - Mostly aluminum, with a bit of plastic on the back.The Mic plugs in with a 3.5mm and is compatible with most smart devices that have the female end. There is even a passthrough connection in the back so you can listen after you record something. Heck, you can even use the Rode VideoMic Me for phone calls or FaceTime, if you want.The kit is pretty decent and includes a dead cat and plastic clamping piece. All in all, a great device to capture better audio for Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook live, not to mention just recording memories on you device. I totally recommend this if you&rsquo;re in the market to increase the audio in your videos on a budget.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-highly-recommend-this-product">I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my go pro vlogging set up! it works great!! I may have to change things up a bit and get the pro, but this mic is AWESOME! For what I use it for, it really takes the cake! I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</p>

<h5 id="rode-videomicro-review">RODE VideoMicro Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review page is combining a bunch of different products My review is of the VideoMicro.I&rsquo;ve tried SO much inexpensive audio equipment over the last couple years trying to find something decent for my small budget. Problem solved! The sound is a mile better than the popular Vidpro XM-55 or SGC-598 so if your considering those do yourself a favor and get this instead. It&rsquo;s also far simpler than using a TASCAM DR-60DmkII or post syncing with my TASCAM DR-40.Just plug it in and get great audio.It&rsquo;s camera powered - No forgetting to turn on the mic or running out of battery. That&rsquo;s s huge plus right there.Its small, stays out of way, has a great wind screen (a good furry is typically almost the price of this whole microphone).It&rsquo;s pretty decent directionally, doesn&rsquo;t pick up a lot of sound from behind the camera. I&rsquo;ve got allergies right now and my stuffy breathing is barely picked up at all.I primarily use it with my Canon 70D but it also mounts to my DJI OSMO via the Osmo - Quick Release 360° Mic Mount with great results.I&rsquo;ll still need a Tascam with Lavalier mics or the Rode NTG2 for some demanding jobs, but I suspect the Rode VideoMico will be used quite a bit on its own too. The quality is great and it just makes life simpler.Also my dog is obsessed with it since it&rsquo;s furry and jiggles in its soft-mount which makes for some fun footage ; )He thinks it&rsquo;s a critter - so I cant leave it lying around!</p>

<h5 id="lots-of-static-with-facebook-live">Lots of static with Facebook Live</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did quite a lot of research before buying this microphone. I wanted to get a top quality, small microphone for Facebook live broadcasts. Everything I read online said this would have no issues, however there are two issues which repeated across 4 or 5 broadcasts.The first was a constant static. It&rsquo;s almost like the mic picked up some interference. So, I tried broadcasting just off of wifi while the phone was in airplane mode. Still had static.The second is that for some reason the audio would always unsync from the video. I&rsquo;ve seen this before, but this was in an extreme way.I&rsquo;ve returned it and am looking for a different microphone now.</p>

<h5 id="this-mic-is-good-but-not-great">This mic is good but not great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mic is good but not great, and how much you like it will really depend on your specific reasons for buying it. The intended purpose of this microphone is to offer you an improvement over your camera&rsquo;s built-in microphone (either a DSLR or mirrorless, or a camcorder with an accessory shoe) and to give you more of a directional mic (it is a mini shotgun) in an extremely compact package. This is however a $50 microphone, and is at the bottom end of Rode&rsquo;s product line of on-camera mics, so don&rsquo;t expect miracles.First, the pros. The mic is very well-built. The housing is all metal, and it has a very solid feel. The included shock mount is awesome, the cable to plug the mic into your camera is very nice quality and is just the right length so that it gets the job done without flopping all over the place. It is also of course coiled, so if you need more length, it&rsquo;s there. Including a dead kitten wind sock was also a really nice touch. You&rsquo;re getting a really nice package for $50. This mic is very compact, even with the shockmount and dead kitten, making it easy to stick into your camera bag. The mic also uses your camera&rsquo;s plug-inpower instead of batteries, meaning that you&rsquo;ll never be caught out with no batteries, as you would be with some other products.Now to the cons. The sound is simply not great. If you are trying to record sound only from your subject when filming, then this mic does OK for what it is. Expect to spend some time messing with EQ afterwards in order to improve the sound quality, though. I was watching reviews on YouTube where people were plugging it into a digital recorder and using it as a near-field mic for doing voiceover and on-camera work, and talking about how great it sounded considering how small and cheap it is. For this application (which to be fair is NOT its intended purpose), the mic is pretty poor. I only messed around with it in this fashion because, being that it uses an accessory/hot shoe mount, you can easily mount it to a tripod, microphone stand, or boom pole and use a longer <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; stereo cable to plug it into a digital recorder. Again, if you&rsquo;re willing to spend some time in post adjusting EQ levels, you can surely bring out the best in this mic, but the standard unedited audio is not going to sound impressive in any way.Just as a warning to Canon camera users, Canon DSLRs have notoriously bad microphone pre-amps in them. If you are plugging this mic directly into the camera (which, again is its intended purpose) you are likely not going to be happy with the sound. Shooting video with a Canon necessitates the use of an external digital recorder, and if you&rsquo;re going to go that route, then there are plenty of other choices as far as microphones are concerned.Personally, I bought this microphone to use with a Sony AX-53 camcorder, as the built-in mic is super omni-directional and therefore not suitable when tyring to train the camera on one particular subject (as opposed to, for instance, filming your kid&rsquo;s soccer game. For that application, it was a clear improvement. Just be aware of exactly what the purpose of this microphone is before purchasing it.</p>
