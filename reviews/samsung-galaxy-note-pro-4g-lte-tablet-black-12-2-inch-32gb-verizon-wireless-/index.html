<h5 id="not-a-great-tablet-don-t-waste-time-and-money">Not a great tablet, Don&rsquo;t waste time and money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disappointed is the word I will use to describe my experience with this device. I am a Samsung fan. I have six phone lines with Verizon, and 5 of them are Samsung phones. Three of the 4 TVs we have in our home are Samsung. So when it came to buying a tablet there was no question which tablet I would buy. I purchased my Galaxy Note Pro in December, and it has already been shipped to Samsung twice for repairs. The first time it just turned off and would not power back on even though it was fully charged. This was after my 30 day return window had expired. I received it back and it worked perfectly for about two weeks. Then The screen began to flicker and power cycle a few times a day. The flickering and power cycling became worse to where it was impossible to use the device. As I write this review my Galaxy Note Pro is at Samsung repair center. I would not go as far as saying don&rsquo;t buy Samsung products because I have them all over my house; cell phones, TVs, you name them, and they work great. But I would not recommend this tablet. Please save yourself headache by looking at some other options if you are on the market for a tablet. Avoid the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 at all cost. When I googled this latest problem, there were numerous people with that flickering issue on XDA developers. Samsung needs to fix whatever is causing the flickering issue, and do a recall and replace it for those having the issue.</p>

<h5 id="a-massive-tablet-with-plenty-of-power">A Massive Tablet with Plenty of Power.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro is my 5th tablet, and of course the largest one I&rsquo;ve ever had. This beast is almost twice the size of my last tablet, the 7&rdquo; Google Nexus 7. With this size tablet you need a lot of power, and it comes with it, with the Samsung Exynos 5 Octa processor, the world&rsquo;s first ARM® based Octa-core mobile CPU, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 MSM8974 2.30 GHz quad core processor. The performance is stellar, though I do get a bit of lag in heavy multimedia use.I have the Verizon 32GB black version so this processor is different than you get in the Wi-Fi only version. The Wi-Fi only processor is the Exynos 5400 1.9 GHz.The huge 12.2 inch screen is just gorgeous, with a very high 2560x1600 resolution, it&rsquo;s beautiful. Watching Netflix or HBO To Go is an amazing experience. What I really like about the display is that you can view it at almost any angle, so if more than one person is watching, you can still enjoy the view.Dual speakers are nice and solid, with very little &ldquo;tinny&rdquo; noise, but overall not super powerful. I usually hook my Bluetooth speakers up if I need a little more sound. I do love the fact you get 2 stereo speakers, that does make movie watching a better experience.One of the reasons I picked this tablet is that it&rsquo;s a Samsung. Unlike some, I actually love the Samsung TouchWiz Loader page. I have it on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, and I love all the dozens of options that allow you to set up your device the way you want it. When I had the Nexus 7, I found myself really missing those options. With that said, on the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 you&rsquo;re forced to use Samsung’s version of Flipboard, called Magazine UX. After a few hours of using it, I found it not very functional or useful. There are a limited number of programs that works with it, and you can&rsquo;t seem to get things like Facebook to work on it. It&rsquo;s too bad there isn&rsquo;t a way to remove that option, because for me, it&rsquo;s a useless tool.One really nice thing is that the Galaxy Note Pro came with the latest Android OS, the Kit Kat 4.4.Because this tablet is designed with business people in mind, it comes with a slew of productivity software, including a year of Business Week +, Samsung Meeting, Samsung Know, and Samsung E-Meeting software installed.A little bit more about the hardware, it comes with an 8mp camera on the rear and a 2mp camera for selfies on the front. It also has 1080p video capability. The camera works pretty nice for a tablet, though I can&rsquo;t see myself using it much, just because of the size of the tablet, but it&rsquo;s there and works great. I love that not only do I get 32GB of internal storage but it comes with a microSD slot which allows up to 64GB of additional storage. That makes for a lot of music and videos.The battery life for a tablet this size is excellent. It comes with a non-removable 9,500mAh battery. I get about 12 hours of steady usage out of it, maybe 10 on heavier usage. Even though this unit comes with a USB 3.0 charger, it takes a pretty long time to charge this size battery. I suggest purchasing a USB 3.0 car charger, for those road trips.Because this is the Note Pro version of the tablet, it comes with a decent but not great S-Pen stylus and software, but I won&rsquo;t get into this too much in this review.I could get into many more details of the tablet, but I think you get the idea, this tablet is a powerful and well built device, with a ton of power, and with the Samsung Touch Wiz, you have a lot of options to configure this device.PROS:Huge 12.2 screenFast Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 MSM8974 2.30 GHzSamsung Exynos 5 Octa processorExternal storageLong battery lifeEasy multitaskingDecent front and rear camerasCONSIt&rsquo;s hugeExpensiveJust ok stylusCharging is fairly slow (because of large battery)</p>

<h5 id="good-but-no-perks">Good (but no perks)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The tablet is definitely big, as others point out. Not a one-handed device by any means. However, I think it&rsquo;s the perfect size for reading/editing PDFs and taking notes - especially if you&rsquo;re drawing sketches or writing down equations (I do scientific research and mechanical engineering work). The screen is about the same size as a piece of paper, and the built-in S-pen and &ldquo;S Note&rdquo; app are great for note taking. I&rsquo;m using this as a research notebook, so that aspect is critical.The screen is gorgeous - no complaints other than it&rsquo;s reflective so glare can be an issue if you&rsquo;re not using an aftermarket screen protector. Speakers are good (for a tablet). Sound through my Klipsch earphones is great, on par with my Nexus 5. The CPU is fast enough for most of what I do, though it will start to slow down if you don&rsquo;t clear your apps periodically (which the built-in task manager makes easy to do). The built-in Hancent Office is one of the better Android office apps from what I can tell - it&rsquo;ll do just about anything except edit equations easily. Battery life is great, both on 4G and Wi-Fi, and it doesn&rsquo;t run hot like the MS surface tablets are rumored to. Download speeds and multi-tab browsing are on par with my work laptop (currently using Chrome).The ability to have multiple apps on screen at the same time is a huge deal as well, though the implementation is a little weird. Regardless, this makes some work tasks possible that are really difficult to do with other Android devices. I&rsquo;ll use this in &ldquo;laptop&rdquo; mode with a Logitech bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and that works okay though sometimes the mouse will stop responding for a few seconds (don&rsquo;t know which hardware to blame yet). This is probably the closest you can get to a laptop replacement without going to a MS surface device. It&rsquo;s still a bit clunky, but a lot of that is due to the apps and not necessarily the device.There is a fair amount of AT&amp;T/Samsung bloatware, but you can disable pretty much all of that. I&rsquo;ll probably root the device at some point so I can use Titanium Backup to do some more tweaking. Side loading apps is easy. Make sure you use a decent anti-virus/malware app (I use ESET).Note that you do NOT get any of the Samsung &ldquo;perks&rdquo; for this model. There is a LONG list of freebie apps and Dropbox space you get with the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; tablet, but ONLY for the Wi-Fi or Verizon models. I guess that&rsquo;s my mistake for not digging through the fine print. Yet another reason to stay away from AT&amp;T (I&rsquo;m using Straight Talk wireless for my 4G service anyway).</p>
