Suaoki¡¯s 5,200mAh/10,400mAh Flashlight also contains a built-in seat-belt cutter, glass hammer, flashlight, and a power bank, helping you during vehicular emergencies, while walking your dog, losing power on your smartphone, or during many other situations. The stainless steel hammer can be covered when not in use, while the hard plastic and metal parts will protect the unit from any unnecessary damage.</p>

<p>Lighting It Up
Need an emergency light for your house or for walking home after dark? Featuring a low, medium, flashing SOS, and max brightness light modes, our flashlight lets you choose the lighting that is suitable for you situation. Use the low beam when you don¡¯t want to disturb others or during hunting, the flashing mode during emergencies, or the max brightness mode for finding your way in the dark.</p>

<p>Charge Smart
Don¡¯t waste time with bulky batteries or without power. Our flashlight features a 5,200mAh/10,400mAh battery, perfect for charging smartphones, tablets, or any other USB gadgets. A conveniently located Micro USB port allows you to charge the flashlight itself, while a 4-LED battery indicator lets you know exactly when the unit is fully charged.</p>

<h5 id="great-combination-of-features-to-have-handy-4-18650-battery-cells-give-this-plenty-of-juice-for-charging">Great combination of features to have handy. (4) 18650 battery cells give this plenty of juice for charging.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No single feature is particularly amazing but it combines 3 things everyone should have in their car (glass breaker/ seat belt cutter, flashlight, and phone charger) into one convenient package. I was curious about the claimed capacity of 10,400 mAh so I decided to open it up and take a look at the guts. I found (4) 18650 batteries, each rated for 3.6V and 9Wh, wired in parallel. So with a total of 36Wh at 3.6V the pack has a total of 10,000mAh which is pretty close to what is claimed. It should be noted that USB devices charge at 5V , not 3.6, so you won&rsquo;t get the full 10,000mAh. Probably closer to 6500mAh but I have not measure for myself. This is how most battery packs report their capacity and still good enough to charge most phones twice so no harm done. I did test charging my Nexus 5x and used the ampere app to check the charge rate. The phone reported a respectable max charge rate of 1500mA. The charger won&rsquo;t blow you out of the water but it has a good amount of juice and it should get you out of a pinch.I agree with other reviewers that the 1.5-2 second hold needed to turn on the flashlight is annoying and could possible be dangerous in a serious situation. It seems a single click activates the charger while a hold activates the light. I would really like to see these features switched in a revision of this product. It seems much more important to have light instantly than to start charging.</p>

<h5 id="nifty-little-tool">Nifty little tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have tested it as a charger and a light source. The different light brightnesses/emergency flash modes are a little counterintuitive and don&rsquo;t match the instructions; we double-tap to turn emergency flash on/off, or single-press to turn on regular beam. If we press too fast trying to get a dimmer beam, we get emergency flash instead. Now that we&rsquo;ve figured it out, it&rsquo;s not that big a deal, but it was weird at first.The glass breaker has a nice little rubber cap, and the seat belt cutter is well-protected, so there&rsquo;s no problem leaving this in the glove compartment where rummaging may occur.The whole thing comes with a USB cable for charging the flashlight and/or charging a device off of it, but doesn&rsquo;t come with a wall wart. Not a problem but might be useful information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="who-knew-it-would-be-this-good">Who Knew It Would Be This Good!?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to love this thing. After all, it was an inexpensive product from an unknown brand that seemed to be trying to fill too many roles to be any good at any of them; much less all of them.However, I DO love it. The build quality is excellent, the flashlight is as bright as advertised (it actually seems a bit brighter than its stated lumens), and the battery is big enough to recharge both of my devices on a single charge. Yep, it&rsquo;s a winner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-flashlight-is-good-with-decent-amount-of-brightness">The flashlight is good with decent amount of brightness</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The flashlight is good with decent amount of brightness, however, I am not sure exactly how many lumen since I am not one of those expert whom would measure it. For a regular user, this appears to be a good quality of flashlight. Given how big the battery is, I do expect this flashlight to last pretty long when it&rsquo;s on. I haven&rsquo;t tried charging so I can&rsquo;t really comment on it but the USB ports appear to be well-built. As for the windows breaker, the tip is sharp and solid enough. I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt whether if I can break any window with it, the real question is how many can I break before this thing goes to retirement. The tip to cover the window breaker is very thoughtful as it will give you protection over your storage place while it&rsquo;s VERY easy to open. The only one mild dislike I have is the size of it. It&rsquo;s a bit on the long side for storage. Especially for those of you who have a smaller car, your storage maybe an issue. For the money vs. quality, this is a good buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="every-car-should-have-one">Every car should have one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I lost my previous escape tool, so I needed to replace it. I chose this because it was a good deal. I like that it&rsquo;s multipurpose, and pray I only ever need to use the charging and the flashlight features. I think everyone should have this for their car. So, why 4 and not 5 stars? I wish it had reflective lettering, or glow in the dark lettering. It would be perfect if you could find it in the dark. Since it&rsquo;s black&hellip;.it&rsquo;s not easy. I&rsquo;ll resolve this with some reflective tape, but it&rsquo;d be a nice built in feature.</p>

<h5 id="make-all-your-geek-friends-jealous">Make all your geek friends jealous</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really neat idea that was well-executed. You have a high-capacity battery ready to charge phones and power a rather bright flashlight. Is it a Streamlight or a Surefire? No, but it&rsquo;s $25. I bet you could still cosh bad guys with the window punch on the back end, anyway. The flashlight button requires a long, deliberate press (my guess is to prevent accidentally turning it on in your bag/glove box and draining the battery), so don&rsquo;t go returning it based on that. I carry it in my laptop bag and I&rsquo;ve flown with it, so it&rsquo;s useful for the business traveler as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-you-d-want-as-an-emergency-tool">Exactly What You&rsquo;d Want as an Emergency Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking to purchase a flashlight that I could leave in the car, that would also be ideal for emergency scenarios, and this one fit the bill. The flashing is an ideal size (about 6.5 inches) and fits great in your hand. The lighting modes are a great touch, so be sure to read the manual first. Battery charge lasts longer than you would expect, and the USB charger (ideally for your phone) is a huge plus, which makes this product a great one to have anywhere. I highly recommend this product if you&rsquo;re in the market for a durable flashlight.</p>
