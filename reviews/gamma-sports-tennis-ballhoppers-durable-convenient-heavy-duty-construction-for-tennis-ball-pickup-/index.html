<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-till-the-legs-fall-off-and-that-happens-often">Great till the legs fall off, and that happens often.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The legs keep falling off. I had to duct tape the legs together to keep enough compression so that when you flip the legs from the holding position to the standing position they don&rsquo;t fall off. VERY VERY VERY frustrating when you tennis balls end up falling out because the legs fell off and then it hits the ground, the top comes off and balls every where. Not the quality from Gamma I&rsquo;m used too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shoddy-construction-breaks-bends-easily-wouldn-t-purchase-again">Shoddy construction, breaks/bends easily. Wouldn&rsquo;t purchase again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shoddy construction and materials all around. The first time I used the hopper, it broke. The weld on the cross-piece on one of the legs gave way, basically rendering the hopper useless.I elected to repair it instead of returning it, as I live in Canada and ordered it from the US (didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle). I ended up wrapping the join with wire and using a 2-part epoxy to coat the hell out of it. I then had to bash the leg into a new shape so that it would still lock in place when upright. Now it looks ugly but is serviceable.The rolling rods on the bottom are also really flimsy (they allow the balls to pop into the basket). They bend out of shape, allowing balls to fall back out, and I have to manually straighten them at least once every time I use the hopper.This is my first hopper, so I don&rsquo;t have anything to compare it to, but overall I&rsquo;m not impressed and would not purchase again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ll-update-functionality-after-i-ve-used-it-for-a-few">I&rsquo;ll update functionality after I&rsquo;ve used it for a few &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll update functionality after I&rsquo;ve used it for a few weeks. For now, the assembly instructions were inadequate, with no diagrams to support the words. Before wrenching on the locknuts, be sure the sides are locked down in the grooved tray. There should be TWO bars inside the tray before proceeding, and everything should be tight when fastening the washers and nuts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strong-upper-body-but-weak-legs">Strong upper body but weak legs!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a Gamma 75 Hi-Rise Plus hopper for cheap, and boy was it cheap and useless. So given I have more balls I decided to try this more robust hopper.Upon receiving it, I was pleased of the feel of the material - definitely stronger and less prone to bending then the flimsy cheaper brother. The handles plugging into the hole was a traditional design that had worked for generations, so it was good. The basket is light without balls, but I&rsquo;m sure it will be heavy when full. With the handles up in carrying/pickup mode, I felt it&rsquo;s very solid (doesn&rsquo;t twist and pop loose).However, when I tried to convert it to serving position (standing up), it was challenging to snap the sides of the legs in. Sometimes one side would pop loose, and sometimes it would pop right back out. I needed my leg and hand to squeeze both to secure both rods of each leg in place. Then standing up, sometime one side would just POP and the whole thing fall to the floor! For the times that it stood, just one of my kid running by it (in my home on the hallow floor) would jolt it enough to POP-AND-FALL again and again.I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s mine that is not built well, but looks like some reviewers identified the same problem. This is my second failure of Gamma hopper. (I&rsquo;m sure the Wilson one isn&rsquo;t any better) It&rsquo;s really disappointing. I&rsquo;m going to try the Gold 75 and hope that will work the best.</p>

<h5 id="great-hopper-works-as-it-should-and-is-very">Great hopper. Works as it should and is very &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great hopper. Works as it should and is very stable when standing on the legs. It&rsquo;s a bit on the heavy side, so my girlfriend won&rsquo;t use it, but for me, it&rsquo;s just what I needed.Would give it 5 stars if it was a bit lighter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-came-disassembled-in-a-box-with-no-instructions">It came disassembled in a box, with no instructions &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It came disassembled in a box, with no instructions, so I had to figure it out on my own (it&rsquo;s not rocket science), but other than that, it&rsquo;s lightweight enough that my 10 yr old can carry it around full of balls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-heavy">Too heavy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my 14 year old son. He doesn&rsquo;t like it. It is very heavy. It is well built and sturdy but this makes it too heavy for him to carry around, and we only have about 30 balls in it. Also, he struggles to get the legs unclipped to carry it. He also doesn&rsquo;t like the lid. He feels it gets in the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it can hold arround 60-65 balls only. Price is very less compared to other sellers. Quality also good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the box was crushed when I received it, and the hopper was lopsided. for that reason, the lid doesnâ€™t align propry and it requires significant force to close it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-designed-and-reasonably-light">well designed and reasonably light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>well packed, easy to assemble..the plastic wraps around the bottom rails and side rails are helpful, but they seem like can fall off anytime ..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fair-price-it-works-no-problems">Fair price, it works, no problems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got these for the community courts. Everyone is happy with the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-i-left-it-even-worse">so I left it even worse.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the red logo is really a sticker that came quite ripped, when I tried to remove it all because of that, is really hard to remove, so I left it even worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hopper">Hopper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well worth the money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Horrible product. Fails almost immediately from the standing position with minimum force.</p>

<p>Good one.</p>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<p>Some sharp edges. I cut my leg in 3 places carrying the basket to the courts.</p>
