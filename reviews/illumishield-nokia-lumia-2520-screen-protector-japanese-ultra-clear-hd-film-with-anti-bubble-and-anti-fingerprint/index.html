Our Ultra Clear HD screen protectors offers superior protection from scuffs and scratches while providing unparalleled crystal clear visibility. Designed to be virtually invisible with a “true touch” feel, iLLumiShield screens are manufactured using only the highest quality PET film imported from Japan. An additional optical-laminate layer enhances the clarity of your screen so that you can enjoy the full range of colors on your favorite devices.</p>

<p>In addition to enhancing your display, the iLLumiShield Ultra Clear HD line also offers:</p>

<p>-Anti bubble silicone resin layer for easy installation
-Scratch resistant layer to keep your screen protected
-Fingerprint proof so that your screen looks pristine
-Ultra Clear coating so that your screen feels silky smooth</p>

<p>iLLumiShield Guarantee
iLLumiShieldis 100% confident that our Ultra Clear HD screen protectors provide crystal clear clarity while protecting your screens from scuffs and scratches. We back our confidence with a no-hassle, lifetime replacement warranty program. Screen protectors should do more than just protect your device. Screen protectors made by iLLumiShield go beyond competitor products by offering superior protection and display quality for your screens.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-lumia-2520">Great for Lumia 2520</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a 2520, you know how smudgy and fingerprinty the screen gets. I was very satisfied with these screen protectors. They are very clear, no loss in sensitivity, and don&rsquo;t pick up fingerprints like crazy. Application was relatively easy, (no need for liquid sprays, etc.), the only tricky part was trying to get dust out from under the screen (Scotch tape is your friend here, just some tips for you all). I didn&rsquo;t use the application card to remove bubbles since I&rsquo;ve read it can scratch or damage the screen protector if pressed too hard. I just used my fingers and hands to press the bubbles to the edge of the screen, and that worked OK for me. The screen protector has been on for about 2 weeks, and honestly you can&rsquo;t really tell that it&rsquo;s there! (unless you look at the camera holes, etc.). They feel sturdy and very protected. Unfortunately, last night I dropped my power brick on the screen, and it must&rsquo;ve fallen on a corner or something, but I noticed a small dent on the screen protector, which protected the glass screen behind it. So scratch-proof maybe, not dent-proof! Anyway, I still like these screen protectors, and will go with Illumishield when looking for replacements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stops-the-fingerprints">Stops the fingerprints</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen protector went on easily and bubble free, as it states. But, more importantly, it stops the collection of fingerprints on my screen that was driving me nuts. If you love your tablet but can&rsquo;t stand finger marks all over the screen, this will solve your problem. I will say, though, to be careful working out the bubbles. I scraped a bit hard in places, and it left a visible mark. Not noticeable except when angled in light, but just warning you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great customer service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The package arrive damaged, due to the fault of the postal delivery person shoving it into our very very small mailbox rather than walk the package to our doorstep as they usually do with packages that are too large. Unfortunately, we had no choice but to apply the damaged screen protector, which left us with two large bubbles that would not come out because the damaged packaging had warped the cover. We have two small kids at home that necessitated the screen cover to begin with, so we decided to just deal with the bubbles rather than wait to send the first set back and exchange them. I contacted Illumishield to notify them of the issue and they were incredibly fast and courteous in their response. Hopefully a new set will arrive shortly. Application was fast and easy, and it&rsquo;s a great product. Very very happy with the purchase and company.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-amazing">These are amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought another brand before this and wasnt happy so i decided to dive in on these guys and it is well worth it. Not to mention lifetime replacements although im not sure how to get them. These screen protectors fit perfectly and where wayyyy easier to get on without user error due to their exact fit. I would highly recommend these and plan to use them on all devices in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-screen-protector">amazing screen protector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better quality than protectors priced 10 times higher. Installation was easy and flawless, even a few specks of dust were not visible when all was said and done. Can&rsquo;t go wrong with these at all, oil and fingerprints are not a problem anymore.definatley gonna buy illumiShield for all my phones and tablets now and in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="improved-my-2520">improved my 2520</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My main objective was to protect the screen, but these protectors help quite a bit against the fingerprints and smudging that seem worse on the 2520 than other screens for some reason.Perfect fit, and other than less fingerprints, the only reason I notice it is there is because I prefer the way it feels over the bare glass when interacting with the device. Not exactly sure why&hellip;and others may disagree.It did wind up needing to use the second one as I had some particles under the first (despite my attempts to get it perfectly clean first). I was able to do better with the second one&hellip;guess that is why they give you two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="even-better-than-expected">Even better than expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried various screen protectors for other devices and have always found them lacking in terms of clarity and ease of installation. Most have left bubbles whether dry or wet installation. When I saw this product I did notice that it had garnered good to excellent reviews and I decided to take a chance with it. The screen of the Lumia 2520 picks up so many fingerprints and so much dust that it really lessens the value of what I feel is one of the clearest, brightest screens available on a tablet.Installation of this product went effortlessly although you really have to make sure the screen is completely free of dust and all fingerprint oils for it to stick well. I did the necessary prep to clean the screen and it went as well or better than I had hoped. All I can say is I am totally satisfied and surprised at how well this looks&hellip;basically invisible which is what one would hope.In addition, the whole fingerprint issue is eliminated once this is on. It almost made me think I was using a whole different tablet. I will definitely purchase this product for any other tablets or devices I purchase in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-fit">perfect fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great cover for my device. It fits perfectly and does what&rsquo;s promised. Finger prints don&rsquo;t really show and it feels thick enough to protect my device. I have iLLumiShield on my phones and I feel secure in knowing it will take some damage. Might need to be replaced from time to time, but it&rsquo;s well worth it.</p>
