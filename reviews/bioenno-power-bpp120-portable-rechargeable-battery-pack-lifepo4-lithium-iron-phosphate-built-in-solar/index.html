<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The Bioenno Power 120 Watt Hour Power Pack, Model BPP-120, is a light weight, compact, backup power pack based on advanced LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) technology.</p>

<p>The unit includes an integrated DC-to-AC inverter for powering laptops, cell phones, tablet computers, and other lower power equipment. The DC Input is at 15VDC/3A and can be charged using the included AC-to-DC charger, or via a separate solar panel. The unit also includes two DC outputs. The first DC output is at 12VDC/5A (using a DC plug). The included adapter converts the output to a car socket type. The second DC output is a USB 5VDC/2.1A output, which can be used for powering cell phones and tablet computers. The unit is rugged and durable and is backed by a 1 year warranty.</p>

<p>The charge time is ~4 hours using the bundled (external) AC-to-DC charger from empty state.</p>

<p>How many times the BPP-120 unit will charge a device (on a single charge)?
Smartphone (with 4-7 Watt-hour battery) about 17 to 30 charges, Digital Camera (with 8 Watt-hour battery) about 15 charges, Tablet (with 25 to 42 Watt-Hour battery) about 3 to 5 charges, Laptop (with 50 Watt-hour battery) about 2 to 3 charges.</p>

<h5 id="well-designed-and-convenient-package">Well designed and convenient package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a portable option for car camping and also emergency use to run or charge various equipment &amp; devices (CPAP, phone, tablet etc.) and this unit has worked very well. I&rsquo;ve mainly run DC loads but have no concerns about the inverter performance when/if needed. The low self-discharge and longevity of this battery chemistry are what interested me in this type of battery and Bioenno has put together a nice package with the BPP120. The cigarette lighter adapter is convenient and there is an included barrel adapter that will accept a bare wire for more flexibility in connecting devices. The case is also designed with four rubber feet on bottom and matching recesses on the top to make it stackable. Overall a nice addition to my kit.</p>

<h5 id="blows-goal-zero-s-sherpa-100-away-and-what-a-product">Blows Goal Zero&rsquo;s Sherpa 100 Away and What A Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I rarely write a review, but this product deserves one! The con&rsquo;s I read in the another review were ridiculous, that person will find something wrong with everything. I did a lot of research, spoke with the company in CA more than once and decided to buy one. I found the product to be EXCELLENT and I was looking for something to use with my major investment in Goal Zero products. This product is superior to the Goal Zero Sherpa 100 in the following ways: better battery life (2000 plus charges), slow discharge, built in AC 100W Inverter, larger battery capacity and looks a lot like the Sherpa. It is slightly larger, but once you add an external inverterr to the Sherpa, not much difference. This comes with a female 12V cigarette adapter, good solid quality cable, etc. You can charge it with a solar panel, main reason I wanted it! I have tested it with the Goal Zero Nomad 20&rsquo;s and it works just fine, you need to use male to female 12V cigarette adapters. This product uses a standard 5.5mm x 2.1mm male plug into both power in and power out on the 12V side. It has a nice blue LED that I appreciate with an LCD read out on battery capacity and it displays Amp draw as well. I did not find the blue LED or power on beep to be a &ldquo;CON&rdquo;, I appreciate them, and the handles don&rsquo;t need to be any larger, big enough to tie down if needed. It also has a separate on/off power switch on the back for the 100 watt AC side and uses an international plug, so you can plug in <sup>110</sup>&frasl;<sub>220</sub>. Also includes a USB 2.1 Amp output to charge various things and only weighs 3.35 lbs, comes in a very nice packaged box. In summary, a great product at an EXCELLENT price point! I have a large investment in Goal Zero and the only thing I don&rsquo;t like is there non-standard proprietary plugs/adapters. However, you can use the 12V female/male cigarettes adapters that come with Goal Zero or order one that has a 5.5mm x 2.1mm male plug to interface this unit. I am planning on also charging it with my Goal Zero Escape Suit Case 30 panels. This unit takes a charge rate up to 15V/3Amp input and so the Goal Zero panels I mentioned will be no problem. I ended up ordering another one and now have them both fully charged packed into a Harbor Freight aluminum case ($30.00), including two Nomad 20&rsquo;s solar panels. A great emergency power, SHTF set up. By the way the Goal Zero Lite-A-Lights work really well with these power packs for <sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>350</sub> lumen lights. I am keeping an eye on this company for other larger power packs to using Lion-Phosphate battery, specifically in a larger power pack. Don&rsquo;t want anymore heavy lead acid AGM&rsquo;s with a limited life cycle, etc. You really can&rsquo;t beat the price and what you get with this product!!****** 3/1/17 UPDATE ******Since purchasing the Bieonno Power BPP120, I have purchased a 2nd BPP120, two BPP-M400 and one BPP-H1200 and they are all great products! I also purchased two of their 28 Watt folding panels to compliment the BPP120&rsquo;s, which all fits nicely into one Harbor Freight Tools Aluminum Suit Case. AGAIN, the battery technology (LIFEPO4) is superior to even what Goal Zero has now released with their Lithium series. Why would you want to pay hundreds more for the GZ new lithium line? I guess if you need colorful displays, a bunch of &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; extra ports, and like non-standard proprietary ports, then pay more! In reality all of these battery systems can only take so much of a draw, so I doubt you will be plugging in a bunch of stuff at the same time. Finally, I can not EMPHASIZE the EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE that I have experience with the technical support staff of Bieonno Power. I can state that my customer experience with GZ, I would rate about 3 stars. They told me they would make some adapters that I was willing to pay for and after five months of chasing after them, excuse after excuse I am told they are not allowed to do that. NOTE, more than one person at GZ told me the opposite. I was even willing to pay for what I needed. I had spent a few thousand $$ over the years on GZ hardware. To conclude Bieonno Power was more than willing to help me with what ever I needed as a customer and rarely have I ever experience such a commitment to their Customers!!!</p>

<h5 id="and-it-has-worked-pretty-well-so-far">and it has worked pretty well so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The fit and finish is not very sophisticated, but it does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, and it has worked pretty well so far. It seems to hold charge relatively well. The attached warranty brochure explains in detail how much you have pay as time goes on to replace the battery, so it gives a good indication of how the manufacturer expects the battery to deteriorate over time. While obviously 100% replacement would be good, but I give the company credit for being transparent upfront.I thought the packaging was over the top. We could have saved a few trees.I&rsquo;ve tried with a desk lamp outdoors and charging phones around the house. It does it pretty well. It has 2 power switches, which confuses me a bit, especially as their purposes are not clearly marked. I appreciate the power reserve LEDs, and the built-in USB port, it just saves another thing I need to remember carrying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sudden-discharge-indicator-problems">Sudden discharge/indicator problems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LCD indicator is useless. On solar, it often will reach 6 bars and stop charging. When I use it to charge a 47Wh laptop it will beep and turn off halfway through (20Wh or so). When I turn it on, it&rsquo;s at 1 bar. Given that I have a voltage regular showing 19V, 20-28W for quite a few hours, it seems there is some other issue going on. This didn&rsquo;t used to happen so much when I first got it a few months ago.At first I suspected an A/C problem, but DC charging with AC off suffers from these issues too.Originally I got this mainly for two AC tourch lamps, though since switched to a 400wh unit. I&rsquo;ll probably replace this with a notebook orientated battery bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-power-system">Great Little Power System</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use it to run Amateur Radio equipment Portable. The LCD Charge State Indicator is a little flaky as it does not do a good job of showing charge state, but the other features outweigh the one small negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Impressive unit.Using as a back up for lighting and charging other devices.Held a charge at 100% for so long I though the digital display was stuck on 100%.</p>
