Notice
1.When disassembling your iPhone SE, please don’t just pull the screen out directly.The ribbon cable of the “Home” button is connected to the screen.It is very flimsy.You should open up the screen a little,disassemble the ribbon cable and then get the screen out.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-expected-fix-works-well">Better than expected fix. Works well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This replacement part fit perfectly on the IPhone SE with no issues. The screen has no apparent defects in color or operation. I did have to transfer the home button and the front facing camera which is pretty easy with the proper tools. The tools that come with this kit make the job more difficult than it needs to be. I used an IFixit tweezer kit, an IFixit suction cup, and the enclosed tools to complete the repair. I would rather have used my magnetic drivers. The suction cup that comes with this kit is useless and needs to be vastly improved or just left out of the kit all together. It&rsquo;s construction is laughable. I would definitely buy this kit again. I am very pleased for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-the-trick-but-not-the-best">Did the trick but not the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husbands screen broke on his iPhone SE. Taking it in costs between $60 and $100 to have it repaired so we decided to buy this and wait. Although the screen does work the items included are not the best. The suction cup didn&rsquo;t work and screwdriver wasn&rsquo;t magnetic making the tiny screws almost impossible to control. Also other sellers include more tools for the same cost. I bought an extra one from another seller (as a backup) and it&rsquo;s MUCH better!BeeFix for iPhone SE / 5S LCD Touch Screen Replacement Display Digitizer with Free Tools and Instructions (NOT FOR iPhone 5/5C) - Black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDJYDW9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_t4cyzb0VW7BRH">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDJYDW9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_t4cyzb0VW7BRH</a></p>

<h5 id="very-good-option-if-you-are-capable-of-installing">Very good option if you are capable of installing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First one faded to nothing within a couple of weeks after installation. Notified and sent pictures of problem and they promptly sent new replacement. I was tired when I installed replacement and had difficulty getting cables to connect properly (cables are a little stiff and not prebent at spot old cables are bent. Not a problem if you aren&rsquo;t tired but I had difficulty that day) and so I installed removed and reinstalled a couple of times before I got it in working properly, but that was my fault not theirs. The last time I managed to stress the glass a little much in the area around the speaker hole resulting in a crack that does not affect functionality nor does it spread so I wouldn&rsquo;t attempt to repair. They have offered a partial refund which I consider above and beyond since that particular problem was my own fault. The screen itself works as well or better than the original. I would say that the glass in this replacement is if better quality than the original. Please remember that screen installation is a very detailed task and not everyone has the capacity to do it themselves. If you can handle the install this is a very high quality replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The presentation (packaging) was promising but the part just barely resembled the one I was replacing. The &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; were just barely legible with the magnifier i was using. I ended up throwing the whole thing in the trash as I couldn&rsquo;t reassemble the camera or restart the phone. Don&rsquo;t waste your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-elsewhere-you-ll-have-less-frustration">Buy elsewhere you&rsquo;ll have less frustration.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Instructions are trash. Watch YouTube videos to fix it. The tools in this set aren&rsquo;t the best. There is only a plastic &ldquo;guitar pick&rdquo; to pet open the phone. I had to use a razor to get the job done. If I had to purchase again I&rsquo;d go with another seller due to the tools that were given. It wasn&rsquo;t sufficent enough to use. The top of my screen still won&rsquo;t close all the way due to me not having the right tools to complete the job! The screen works and I was able to replace it for a fraction of the cost. This is my first attempt at this DIY project and a project it is. You must have good near sighted vision, small fingers and a lot of patience. An hour and a half later I have a working screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything works and it was here in time. The one thing I will say is, you get what you pay for. The led quality is lacking compared to the original screen. But that is my only complaint and I expected this before I bought it. I would recommend this to friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine-as-a-cheap-replacement">works fine as a cheap replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works fine as a cheap replacement, however there is some light bleed on the screen, and oddly my polarized sunglasses wont allow me to view screen without turning my head sideways. glass scratches very easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-and-fast-to-replace-and-seems-reliable">Easy and fast to replace and seems reliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and resolution is of comparable quality as original if not of the same quality. Holds up to normal wear and tear without any issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">EXCELLENT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent seller highly recommended. thank you very much</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t include the tool to remove the phone portion located on the side of the iphone</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works fine</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great. Had to go online for more detailed instructions but I replaced my sons screen a month ago and it still works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great Buy</h5>
