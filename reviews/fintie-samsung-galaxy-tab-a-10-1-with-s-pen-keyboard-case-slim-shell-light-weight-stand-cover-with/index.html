<h5 id="great-product-lightweight-worth-every-penny">Great Product! Lightweight! Worth every penny..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PACKAGING: The product didn&rsquo;t have prime when I ordered it, however, it did arrived 5 days after ordering, considering the thanksgiving weekend and it it was coming from East coast to west coast, I&rsquo;d say it was pretty good.. Amazon did a good job on boxing the package as usual, but the product itself was well packaged with cushion foam inside the plastic to protect it from damage. The keyboard was on a separate box and it came with a short micro USB cable for charging.QUALITY: The product has a look and feel of a leather and a non slip almost like a suede material inside. My Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S Pen fit perfectly on the plastic frame that is attached to the cover. My pen is easily accessible and the hole for the camera and flash was perfectly aligned. The magnet that holds the keyboard holds it firmly and it allows the tablet to sit on an angle. You may have to move the keyboard pass the case to get the right angle you want but it&rsquo;s not a big deal. You&rsquo;ll also need to move the keyboard before and after use to close the case but then again, it&rsquo;s really easy to do&hellip; The keyboard keys are perfectly gaped, they are not too crowded like the other mini keyboard i have used, it doesn&rsquo;t even feel like I&rsquo;m on a small keyboard and it&rsquo;s easy to adapt. We ordered 2 of these and both of the products was identical with perfect alignment. This product is light enough for an on the go traveler and student like us. We were afraid that we won&rsquo;t like this product since there was no review or information about it but it turned out to be a great product for the money&hellip;THE BAD: Moving the keyboard before and after use to close the case, but that is so minor and a small price to pay for a very lightweight case such as this. There was a very small peeling at very corner inside where the magnet for the keyboard sit, and they&rsquo;re not random since both of our case are the same but then again, I hardly notice it and it&rsquo;s not fair removing a star for a well made and rightly priced product such as this.CONCLUSION: Great product! Priced just right! Lightweight with an option to take your keyboard or not.. Highly Recommended!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was looking for a decent keyboard to hook up to this tablet. This one works out pretty well, especially for the price. Keys are responsive and comfortable to type with. The case itself feels nice and can accommodate with or without keyboard attached, which is a big plus. I don&rsquo;t always need to have the keyboard so its nice to be able to ditch it when I want to. So far I haven&rsquo;t had any connectivity issues.Would be nice if the USB charging port were on the left side of the keyboard though. That way if you were charging both tablet and keyboard, you have cables on one side only.</p>

<h5 id="very-well-made-inexpensive-keyboard">Very Well Made, Inexpensive Keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d purchased this keyboard case after doing research to find a reasonably priced case for my Tab. I didn&rsquo;t initially plan on getting a keyboard case, but my husband told me it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to type with a regular foldable cover. His tablet has a kickstand on it, and after testing it out, I changed the type. During my research, I noticed that this particular company kept showing up on lists of best cases to have (and I actually own one for my Tab 8.0), and it also helped that the keyboard was removable.The colors on the case are vibrant and look better in person.The keys have a nice feel to them. They don&rsquo;t feel cheap and have a nice spring to them.It&rsquo;s got keys specifically for searching, returning to the home screen, copying and pasting.The search key works for whatever app you&rsquo;re on that allows searching. Using the Wikipedia app? Press the search key and search. On the home screen? It brings up the Google search bar.Once it&rsquo;s connected to your tablet, you don&rsquo;t have to type in your password. Just press enter and you&rsquo;re in.The keyboard connects by magnets so it doesn&rsquo;t slide all over the place.The case is very sturdy. I feel that if I dropped it my tablet would be protected. This is not to say that it&rsquo;s built specifically for that, but I feel confident that my tablet wouldn&rsquo;t shatter if it should fall.On the downside, the keyboard is a bit cramped. Not surprising as it&rsquo;s for a 10-inch tablet, but that might be a dealbreaker for some.Because the keyboard is a bit, you have to modify how you type just a bit. It&rsquo;s nothing major, but there is just the tiniest of learning curves.The keyboard is very light. It does feel a bit flimsy.</p>

<h5 id="nice-construction-and-appearance-but-i-don-t-like-the-effort-to-set-up">Nice construction and appearance, but I don&rsquo;t like the effort to set up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made and nice keyboard. What I don&rsquo;t like is that you have to shift the keyboard down to give the stand enough room to work every time you open it. That may seem trivia, but I think most people want this to be like a laptop where you just open and go, and here there is a 5 second set up effort every time, and you really can&rsquo;t easily move it once set up - too floppy to move about with out closing and re-opening. This may seem overly picky, but it was annoying enough for me to buy another case where I don&rsquo;t have to do that - I&rsquo;d rather have a kick stand than have to move the magnetically attached keyboard every time. You might not care as much.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-combination-of-magnetic-keyboard-and-protective-cover-for-business-use">Excellent combination of magnetic keyboard and protective cover for business use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used the cover for about a week and the keyboard once - pretty much the 2nd time typing on it. Feels high-quality and not cheaply made!Cover is solid, fits very well, and definitely keeps your P580 tablet in good shape. Magnetic fintie keyboard types like a real keyboard. What I ike about the keyboard is that you can move it around and not stuck in one position. It almost makes my tablet feels like a latptop/desktop. So, I&rsquo;m gving both 5 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case-major-flaw">Great case &hellip; MAJOR FLAW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very disappointed with this case. The physical case is great but unless you plan to always use the keyboard, it is frustrating. If you fold the cover back under the tablet, the magnets in the case cause the tablet to shut off. I have contacted Samsung to ask what setting could be changed but their solution did not work. I will be returning this if there is no solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-case-and-the-keyboard-works-great">nice case and the keyboard works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>nice case and the keyboard works great.it would have been 5 if the case wouldalso enclose the keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-built-case-but-with-severe-design-flaw">Well built case, but with severe design flaw</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For starters, I really wanted to like this keyboard case. It had promise and the product images gave me hope so I purchased one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-cover-and-keyboard">Good cover and keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The best cover and keyboard for the money. The cover works well, and the keyboard is very easy to use, even with large hands like mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-that-smells-bad">Great product that smells bad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product for the price. But word of warning: it smells weird and it took months for that smell to wear off. With that being said, the quality is actually quite good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-the-tablet-with-no-issues">Fits the tablet with no issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks nice and fits my tablet great! Has an opening for the S Pen and automatically wakes screen when you open it. Looks more teal/turquoise in the picture than it really is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-purchase">Happy with purchase</h5>

<p>Very pleased with purchase. A mice casr and really nice keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="great-case">Great Case!</h5>
