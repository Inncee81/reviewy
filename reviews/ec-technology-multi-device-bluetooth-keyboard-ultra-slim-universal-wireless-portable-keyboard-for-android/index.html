<h5 id="this-keyboard-changed-my-mind-about-bluetooth-keyboards-for-tablets">This keyboard changed my mind about Bluetooth keyboards for tablets.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After receiving this from another site, I figured I would post my review of this item my review on Amazon. I have never purchased a Bluetooth keyboard intended for my tablet before despite having looked at several. I always just used the on-screen keyboard and thought Bluetooth keyboards were a little gimmicky prior to actually getting one. Though I have only paired this with my tablet so far, I also intend to pair this with my phone and work laptop which has built in Bluetooth capabilities. It&rsquo;s also really nice that this keyboard allows up to 3 Bluetooth devices to be paired simultaneously and has quick-switch shortcuts. This means that if I&rsquo;m at work, I don&rsquo;t need to physically touch my phone to respond to texts if using this keyboard. I&rsquo;ll be able to type out text responses and emails quickly on my phone and switch back to my work computer in no time.In the past, I&rsquo;ve owned several different wireless Logitech keyboards which were similar, but operated using a Logitech specific adapter instead of Bluetooth. I&rsquo;ve always loved the high quality Logitech chiclet-style keyboards because of the sturdy build quality and reassuring key press feeling. I was really happy when I first unboxed this keyboard and realized that this keyboard has the same sturdy build quality and solid key press feeling. In terms of overall weight, I would estimate that it&rsquo;s about as heavy as my 8&rdquo; Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet with an Otterbox Defender case. Overall, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s overly heavy or too light. It feels about right weight-wise. It&rsquo;s also very slim and easily fits in my laptop bag with no issues.As the pictures I uploaded with my review show, the stand works well with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0. Once I realized how to pop the secondary legs out, it was really easy. They&rsquo;re also pretty sturdy as I haven&rsquo;t noticed any shaking of my tablet while in use. After my initial use, I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the legs securely attach underneath the device, seemingly by some sort of magnetic attraction.Though I cannot speak to battery life, I don&rsquo;t expect that it will be an issue based on my experience with other wireless keyboards. Also, I&rsquo;ve never had any battery-life issues with my EC Technology wireless Bluetooth earphones, which leads me to believe that there won&rsquo;t be any issues with this either.Though I really like this keyboard as is, there are a few minor things that would have made this product a bit nicer. First, I would have liked to have seen a rechargeable battery used instead of 2 &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; batteries. While I probably won&rsquo;t have to change them for a while, it&rsquo;s still nice to be able to quickly recharge the keyboard since I don&rsquo;t usually have extra &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; batteries. The only other improvement that I would have liked would be, as another reviewer noted, a lid or shield of some sort to keep the keyboard clean from dust while not in use. After a few days of sitting out, mine has some dust on it. While it&rsquo;s easy enough to blow it off or wipe it down, it would be a nice touch. Overall, my recommendations are minor though!As I write this review using this keyboard, I also look forward to extensively using this keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="great-bluetooth-keyboard-with-minor-flaws">Great Bluetooth Keyboard with Minor Flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:-small, light and portable-near-full sized keys-easy pairing with multiple devices-easy/quick switching between devices-stable/sturdy stands for a table or phone-great stand angle for reading/typingCons:-the stand is not padded-keystrokes not always picked up when pressing corners of the keys-location of the power switch (minor)-battery-powered (minor)In-depth review:This keyboard is in many ways exactly what I was looking for. It is small enough to easily fit in a backpack, light enough to be portable, and the stand securely holds my iPad at the perfect angle for typing and reading (when set horizontally). It paired quickly with my iPad, iPhone, and Windows 10 desktop at the same time via the connection switching functionality, and I was able to switch back and forth between all three with no issues (just a couple seconds between each reestablished connection before I could start typing again, which is to be expected). Also, I like that despite the keyboard being compact, the size of the keys themselves are not much smaller than a standard keyboard, making it easy to type in general.Two small issues that may turn other buyers away, though: 1) the stands that pop out, while useful, aren&rsquo;t padded, so there could be some issues with scratching the back of your tablet or phone if you don&rsquo;t have a case, and they are also a bit thin, so you have to make sure if you set a tablet up vertically that it won&rsquo;t fall over; and 2) the keys can feel a bit stiff at times, and if you try hitting a key on the corners (as opposed to hitting the center), it might not recognize the key you pressed (but this might be remedied simply by getting use to the keyboard itself, since I&rsquo;ve had similar issues with flat keys before).Two design issues that are forgivable are the placement of the power switch being sort of tucked away on the side (but better than being on the bottom) and the fact that it is battery-powered (we&rsquo;ll see how long the batteries will actually last!).All in all, this is a very good keyboard for the price, and the two issues I&rsquo;ve had so far do not outweigh the benefits enough to make this a 4-star review.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-keyboard">Love this keyboard!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received this keyboard, and am writing this review using it. I also have a Belkin wired keyboard with stand (school model) that I use primarily with my work tablet, and I love that one. I bought this Bluetooth one to use with my personal tablet, as I wanted to save wear and tear on the port where the wired keyboard plugs in (same port as the charger). I&rsquo;m using it with a Samsung 8&rdquo; Tab E from my cellular carrier.This keyboard is nearly full size, the keys are springy and responsive, and it&rsquo;s easy to type accurately. There is no lag in typing, and continued typing has not caused freezing. Since it&rsquo;s Bluetooth and uses 2 AAA batteries, the tablet can be charged during keyboard use (the Belkin wired draws power from the tablet). The keyboard is weighty enough to balance the tablet. The stand holds the tablet well for table use; if working on your lap, it needs to be set on a firm surface first, like a clipboard.The only cons I can find:- It can&rsquo;t be moved easily with the tablet on the stand, unless it&rsquo;s on a clipboard. I lost my entire review when I tested moving it.- It doesn&rsquo;t come with a case or cover to protect the keys for transport, so the plastic bag / box it came in or something else is needed.- I hope the plastic clips on the back that swing out to hold the tablet as a stand don&rsquo;t break. They don&rsquo;t seem exceptionally sturdy, but are a good design, as they fold flush with the back of the keyboard when not in use. The keyboard can be used without the stand, if the tablet is in a case that converts to a stand.Overall, I would highly recommend this tablet. It&rsquo;s a quality keyboard, types flawlessly, pairs well, and is a good value for the money.</p>
