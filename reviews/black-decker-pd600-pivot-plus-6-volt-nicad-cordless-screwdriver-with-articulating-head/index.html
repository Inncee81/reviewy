<h5 id="rip-off-do-not-buy-not-worth-any-money-at-all">rip off, do not buy!! not worth any money at all.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>used one time and thought what a great cordless screwdriver. so, went to use it a second time and it broke!! just quit working and sounds like it is stripped or something. it will not rotate and drive in or take out a screw. this is nuts! black and decker used to make great products, but this is not worth any money at all. was so shocked it worked one time and that was it, it&rsquo;s broken. we were only doing a light assembly project of a small book shelf and then wanted to hang some pictures. would give it no stars, but that is not an option. so very very disappointed. sending it back for a refund, but we still have to pay for return shipping and that makes me very sad. what a rip off!</p>

<h5 id="i-love-it-it-is-lightweight-and-very-easy-to">I love it. It is lightweight and very easy to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all Kudoos to Black and Decker&hellip;. I purchased this drill and used it a few times. BTW, I love it. It is lightweight and very easy to use. I love the tiling feature. Then, I think I used it for a bigger/heavier project that is not really intended for this tool. It seemed the power behind the motor stopped being powerful. It would &lsquo;spin out&rsquo; for lack of a better way to describe it. Not sure if I burned it up or what happened. It still worked fine for small jobs. I finally got around to calling Black and Decker asking about the problem and after a few basic question, they said they would send a new one. (I&rsquo;d had the tool for about 8 months) An next thing I know 5 days later, UPS dropped off a new tool. Now I am looking for new projects&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="less-features-than-the-older-model">Less features than the older model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For about 10 years I had one of these handy devices. It was my go-to for 90% of household jobs (plus art installs at shows) since it&rsquo;s lighter than my DeWalt 18V drill / screwdriver. My old one died not long ago so I bought this one to replace it. Sadly, they made some changes to it that are a bit disappointing. My older version had a mini tape measure in the handle, the new one does not. The old one had a drill head bit that fit in a holder on one side and a double-side flathead / Phillip head bit for the other. This one comes with three separate bits but still only two storage slots on the side. The drill bit on my old one got lost pretty early on because it wouldn&rsquo;t stay in the little storage slot. The new one has the same problem, the drill bit sits in that slot very loosely so it falls out really easy. The AC adapter is smaller on this one so I guess that&rsquo;s a minor plus. It still does that job well but it cost me about $10 more that it did 10 years ago, but with less features. The price increase I expected, the changes I did not.</p>

<h5 id="no-reverse-until-i-tweaked-it-for-a-while">No reverse until I tweaked it for a while.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Brand new out of the box it seemed to work fine until the reverse started to have trouble. I&rsquo;ve only gotten about 5 minutes total with this screwdriver so far and the reverse stopped working completely. I was on the phone with the help desk to get an exchange, and while I was on hold, I was fiddling around with the screwdriver. There seemed to be a &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; in pressing the reverse button and kind of wiggling side to side. After a few minutes of messing with it, it seemed to clear up completely and work just fine, forward and reverse. I don&rsquo;t have complete confidence that this will solve the problem long term, but it does seem fine for now.If not for the messy reverse button, I would say I&rsquo;m pretty happy with this screwdriver. I hope it continues to work without problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-power-screwdriver-good-value-for-the-price">Good power screwdriver, good value for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have bought several of these over the years. I use these daily in an electronics repair shop. Usually they last a year or two and then need replacement. The weakest part seems to be the switch, after awhile either forward or reverse will quit or become intermittent. If you&rsquo;ve got the time and patience they can be dissassembled and repaired, but sooner or later the switch will fail completely. Also had a couple with bad clutches. Overall happy with this unit for the hours I use it, spending 20$ a year for a power driver is a good deal. I would expect, under normal use at home it would last much longer, as long as the user understands it&rsquo;s just a power screwdriver, not an impact driver or made for high torque requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="father-s-day-gift-to-husband">Father&rsquo;s day gift to husband.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If your husband ever bought you a circular saw for Mother&rsquo;s day, this is the equivalent. My screw driver finally gave up the ghost after 15 years. So I bought this for Hubby for his Father&rsquo;s Day gift. He used to use mine all the time at home anyway. He keeps most of his tools at the shop and has to go get them to use around the house, so he always liked using my electric screwdriver/drill.This one is better because the handle can change from a gun to straight. If the screw is just out of my reach or space is compromised, I can straighten out the handle. I&rsquo;m going to love it! Oh, and he will too. <grin></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stopped-going-in-reverse-after-two-weeks">Stopped going in reverse after two weeks!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>2 stars means &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; I want to like it and may change my review going forward, but for now, here is why&hellip;1 - Slightly heavier then I expected. I bought this to replace the cheap Ikea electric screwdriver (that finally lost its charge after much use) that I found myself reaching for more often than my drill. I wouldn&rsquo;t fault this product, I should have looked at the weight more.2 - It doesn&rsquo;t bend to a total right angle. The image you see is as far as gets.3 - The big reason for the two stars&hellip;reverse stopped working after owning this a couple of weeks. It still goes forward just fine, but nothing happens anymore when I try and go in reverse. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but just stopped one day last week. I&rsquo;ve packaged it up and dropped in mail to exchange in case it was just a fluke.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-good-as-i-expected-from-black-decker">Not good as I expected from Black &amp; Decker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not good as I expected from Black &amp; Decker. I bought TackLife screwdriver along with this one and I found Tacklife to be more powerful.TackLife is much smaller than this.</p>
