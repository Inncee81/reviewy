<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="nice-product">Nice product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For this price, it&rsquo;s really good! Took me a few minutes to set up and it&rsquo;s really cool. This is the maximum height for it. :)) It came with this cleany thingy and a bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tentative-recommendation-lightness-may-be-a-selling-point-but-has-it-s-downfalls">Tentative recommendation, lightness may be a selling point but has it&rsquo;s downfalls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased eCostConnection 50&rdquo; Inch Aluminum Camera Tripod (roll credits) to experiment with iPhone photography. And really was excited when it arrived all the way to unpacking and setting it up. Then, I could see the future…and it was ominous!The short answer:In spite of being excited upon receipt/ opening this tripod, it is a bit of a disappointment. While I can’t review what hasn’t happened yet, it is a fairly flimsy product. While I like a lot of the design, I just wish the thing felt sturdier. Overall I liked it and give it a tentative buy.The longer review:Things I liked:The packaging was very good, making me excited to see how good this works! I thought I had found a hidden gem!It comes with a nice little bag to carry it in, and set up was easy.The legs lock fairly tightly, but easily, so it shouldn’t just collapse. There is a ‘stabilizer triad’ (my own word) in the center to keep the legs equidistant from each other; experience tells me this is an important design option.The head has 3 axis of rotation, kind of standard on a tripod, but you know…There is a bubble level for one axis, which is nice!The smart phone mount (read ‘clamp) is better than other but still just OK.The set-screw, while it had a good head on it for turning, believe it or not this is something to comment on, others don’t!You get a microfiber cloth woo-hoo!The price is fair, given the kit you are getting.Things I did not like:They use how light this is as a selling point…pretty smart marketing. But I don’t think it is a plus. I will not be trying it in winds much more than a gentle breeze, as it is so light and the stance so narrow I believe it will be blown over.I have to say it. This thing feels a bit flimsy. I know it will hold up a cell phone, and don’t believe any camera would crush it, but anything much heavier than said phone will make it top heavy. That is concerning!I really don’t like the ‘clamp’ cell phone holders. Although comparing others, this seems to be a good one, to use them you have to hold down the tripod while pulling up on the ‘clamp’ and placing the camera, (how many hands do they think I have?) there has to be a better way!Things I hated:There was nothing I ‘hated’ about this product, and even the ‘did not like’ things more than likely apply to similarly priced 50’’ tripods!Restating my conclusion:In spite of being excited upon receipt/opening this tripod, it is a bit of a disappointment. While I can’t review what hasn’t happened yet, it is a fairly flimsy product. While I like a lot of the design, I just wish the thing felt sturdier. Overall I liked it and give it a tentative buy.Note:I find myself buying way too many Amazon products attempting to find things that meet my needs. So I am shooting to become a &lsquo;vine&rsquo; member. Please, if you like my review if you find it helpful let Amazon know by clicking ‘yes’ at the bottom. If not, let me know how I can improve!</p>

<h5 id="easy-enough-for-my-10-year-old-to-use">Easy enough for my 10 year old to use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My ten year old daughter makes stop-motion movies of her American Girl dolls. The only thing she asked Santa for was a tripod that would hold her iPhone 6. Santa brought her this tripod. She likes it because it is very adjustable. You can change the height and angles very easily. Santa also brought her a Bluetooth remote control shutter and some Cowboy Studio lights. She is LOVING Santa&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="hands-free-and-no-gigantic-stick-to-hold">Hands free and no gigantic stick to hold</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this! Now I don&rsquo;t have to bother anyone to take my picture repeatedly to get that &ldquo;PERFECT SHOT&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-so-much">LOVE THIS SO MUCH</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE THIS SO MUCH! It got to me in 5 days! I would recommend this if you are on a tight budget, but still, this product is FANTASTIC! It works amazingly. Great for its price. It helps me record my makeup videos, since I record on my Iphone6 Plus. I would so totally buy from this seller again. Great service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-great-for-the-price">Very great for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very great for the price! Legs are flimsy like the reviews say but it&rsquo;s not so bad. Doesn&rsquo;t bother me because I&rsquo;m using this for YouTube videos at home and not bringing it out. You screw the mount on. Unclip the clips, pull the legs out and clip it again to the size you want it at. Perfect for me, thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use">Easy To Use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m no video professional, and I&rsquo;ve never had a tripod before, so I can&rsquo;t really compare this to anything else&hellip;but, it works perfect for me. I use it with my iPhone 6s, and it does a great job. Here are some of the positives:- Adjusting the height and positioning on this tripod is extremely simple, and it&rsquo;s very easy to use overall.- My iPhone fits perfectly into the holder, and there&rsquo;s no chance of it coming lose, or moving around.- Along with the height adjustments, there are a lot of different ways to maneuver the camera around. I find that there&rsquo;s a seemingly endless amount of options for positioning.Like I said, I&rsquo;m no professional, and I&rsquo;m sure that there are more expensive products that people use, but to me, this has everything that I could need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adequate-for-minor-uses">Adequate for minor uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed something light, cheap, and quickly and this fit the bill. An example of you get what you pay for, which isn&rsquo;t much in this case. I&rsquo;m not faulting it for that, as I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be a great unit and it isn&rsquo;t. So the reason for 3 stars instead of 5 for meeting those expectations is that I don&rsquo;t want anyone thinking that it&rsquo;s a great tripod. It is basically adjustable and if you have the time and the patience, it will get the job done, but that&rsquo;s all.Pros:Very lightNothing broke off or wouldn&rsquo;t workWorks with my iPhone 7 without the Otterbox [too tight with it]Cons:Can be difficult to adjust as legs do not telescope easilyCan be difficult to have the phone hold at right angles since the top piece doesn&rsquo;t clamp down tightly and the side to side is not parallel {though I did finally get it to sit adequately]Not trustworthy in a mission critical situationThe slightest jostle or breeze could blow it overAll in all, it was adequate for my needs as I ordered it to be delivered to my remote location and I only used it for doing some vlogging. But for anything else, I&rsquo;m just glad I have a real tripod.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="throw-away-your-money">THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke within the first day of use.Don&rsquo;t purchase, might as well throw money out the window at least someone else might get use of the money rather than this product&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-but-not-good">Not bad but not good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An okay product for the price. It extends quite a bit and holds the iPhone well but it is a bit flimsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as I took it out the box parts begin to break off immediately. I emailed them and haven’t heard anything back.</p>

<p>It just broke after 3 weeks. The phone can&rsquo;t stand anymore. The joint between the phone holder and the pivot is weak</p>
