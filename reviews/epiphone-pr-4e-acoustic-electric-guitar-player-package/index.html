This ideal size and shape guitar is constructed with Mahogany body and Select Spruce top, Mahogany neck with Rosewood fingerboard and Chrome hardware. It features a passive piezo pickup with volume control.</p>

<p>Cutaway Style
Some ask why a guitar in the cutaway style. The answer is simple: better access to the frets. A single cutaway allows the fingers to move past the neck-body join. In an acoustic guitar, cutaways can change the sound quality of the guitar. In an electric guitar, it makes no difference if it is a single cutaway or a double cutaway. It all comes down to style and fingering preference.</p>

<p>Studio-10 Acoustic Amp
This is a small 10-Watt solid-state practice amp made by Epiphone. Its controls include volume, gain, treble, mid, bass and a boost switch. The controls are excellent for an amp this size. This versatile amp is excellent for the beginner and can take a more experienced player a long way. It is ideal as a practice amp. It does not sacrifice sound while it protects your fuses.</p>

<p>About Epiphone
Epiphone is one of American&rsquo;s oldest and most revered instrument makers and since 1873, Epiphone has made instruments for every style of popular music. The name evokes both history and the spirit of invention. Epiphone has been an audible presence in every great musical era from the mandolin craze of the early 1900s to jazz age guitars of the 1920s. From swing-era archtops through post-war pop, jazz, R&amp;B, and early rock n&rsquo; roll. From the &ldquo;British Invasion&rdquo; to heavy metal, punk, grunge, and thrash. And now, in the 21st century, new Epiphone technical breakthroughs such as the ProBucker pickup, series parallel switching, built-in KillSwitch pots, the Shadow NanoFlex and NanoMag pickup systems, and premier acoustic/electric guitars with the eSonic preamp have brought the historic name to a new generation.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-really-disappointed-you-put-6-worth-of-tuning-pegs-in-this">I am really disappointed you put $6+ worth of tuning pegs in this &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave one star at the Guitar, the running pegs that are in the product picture are not the same that you send me and sixth string tuning peg is winding back when I try to tune the gears inside has a play. I am really disappointed you put $6+ worth of tuning pegs in this guitar. On the left is is the picture of the T. pegs that Got. on the right is the one you send me as advertised</p>

<p>I give it a 4 start review not because it&rsquo;s bad, but because of little things that I found in my guitar package. Package really has everything you need to start up!!The guitar sounds great and loud for the body it has, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the size of a jumbo guitar.The issue I found with the guitar is mainland with the bridge. Seems like the wood used is a little on the soft side and could ware out sooner than expected and that the pins for the strings are on the skinny side and slide out, nothing a replacement set can&rsquo;t fix, but still should no be like that for a new guitar. Finally the tuner isn&rsquo;t very accurate, I&rsquo;d rather tune it by ear or using an app on my phone.In general, though it&rsquo;s a Chinese made Epiphone, the quality is there and everything in the package works!! I honestly can say you will not go wrong with this package for a beginner or a veteran, it&rsquo;s just a great economical guitar!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this guitar player pack 2 weeks ago and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. This thing sounds great, tunes easy with the supplied tuner which I saw had some bad reviews so I went to my local guitar store and bought a Korg tuner and they are in perfect sync. My guitars fit and finish is very nicely done. The little amp compliments this guitar perfectly. Its got plenty of power an doesn&rsquo;t distort until u turn it way up. While at the store I also picked up some phosphor bronze strings and a used hard shell case. I don&rsquo;t care how cheap the price was this is way to nice a guitar for a gig bag. After changing strings and a quick tune it sounds great, no string buzz if u set it up right in my experience. Even if u have to have a pro set it up right, (recommended) this is a great value. Outstanding Epi</p>

<h5 id="great-guitar-for-the-money">Great guitar for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I sold my fender squier stratacaster for this guitar.when I opened the box it was so beautiful nothing like what pictured showed. Easy to tune and the amp is wanderful. This guitar comes with great surprises as well. Gibson has done it again. This guitar is great for a beginner. The only flaw is that it doesn&rsquo;t have a pick guard but those are cheap to buy. Would buy again.</p>

<h5 id="tough-to-beat">Tough to beat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice setup, guitar wood looks beautiful, amp is awesome with chorus and loud for 15w, perfect bedroom setup, easy to play. Ships in reinforced double box (inside amazon box), case and strap cheap but tuner works well. It will require professional setup when you first get it but well worth the $</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="horrible-craftsmanship">Horrible craftsmanship</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! My neck was damaged, the frets were all too high on the neck. The top is plywood with a veneere. Overall I am highly disappointed. You&rsquo;d be better off going to a shop and getting a new one. The only good thing is the amp.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-package-great-price">Great package&hellip; great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent guitar! Sounds great with or without the amp. Onboard EQ on guitar lets tone be controlled on the fly and the amp controls add even more tone versatility. Guitar game set up, holds it&rsquo;s tuning and is very comfortable to place. The extras were a nice surprise as well. Strap, gig bag and strings make sure you are ready to go. Throw a pair of Martin acoustic strings on this and the sound quality without the amp is even richer. Playing with a capo on the strings it comes with makes it sound a little flat without the amp, but the better strings solved that issue.</p>
