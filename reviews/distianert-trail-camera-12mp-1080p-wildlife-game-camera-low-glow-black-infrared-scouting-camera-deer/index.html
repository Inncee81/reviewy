<h5 id="good-camera-but-has-some-drawbacks-read-this-and-you-ll-best-know-how-to-use-it">Good Camera But Has Some Drawbacks! Read This And You&rsquo;ll Best Know How to Use It!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> ABOUT THIS CAMERA:This is a low-glow (i.e. red flash) trail camera. It runs on between 4 and 8 AA batteries.BACKGROUND, ABOUT ME, AND MY HISTORY WITH TRAIL CAMERAS:I have several other trail camera brands including Stealth Cam, Moultrie, Covert, Primos, Browning, TEC.BEAN, and now Distianert. Honestly, the day time pictures with all of these brands are adequate for hunting and scouting purposes. What separates a camera in my eyes is trigger time, quality night pictures, recovery time, battery life, strap connecting to the tree, ease of setup, pictures of an object in motion, and durability. I’ve been using trail cams since about 2009, mainly with pictures. I started taking videos with trail cameras in 2014 and took quite a few in 2015 in addition to taking pictures. My choice in taking pictures or videos depends on the setup. I don’t do time lapse. It’s just not something that’s useful for my hunting/scouting purposes. If you can’t decide on pictures or video, hybrid mode is a good option. I have included a video and some pictures.A NOTE ON THE SIDE SENSOR:Something peculiar about this camera that I haven&rsquo;t seen in many other cameras is the sensors on each side. Supposedly, the sensors on the side detect movement and &ldquo;wake&rdquo; the camera before game enter the picture. If you&rsquo;re familiar with game cameras, this is the most timely matter when taking pictures. The camera sleeps to conserve battery, but it takes time to wake up. In theory, this is a nice feature. However, I&rsquo;m not sure it makes much difference based on my use and testing.WHAT I LIKE:+ Tripod mount hardware included (if that&rsquo;s a feature you use it migh be helpful)+ LCD Screen allows users to see where camera is pointed and you can review pictures/videos on it – Very unusual to see that in this price range+ Easy to follow and program menu+ High quality day pictures and video with excellent audio quality+ Hybrid Mode (video + pictures), Video mode (1 to 60 second settings or, 3, 5, and 10 mins) Photo bursts from 1 to 3 pictures at a time+ Security password (optional)+ It takes up to 8 AA batteries, so batteries don’t need to be swapped as often as some cameras+ I have taken fewer blurry pictures of moving objects than many other cameras I&rsquo;ve used+ I haven&rsquo;t had a ton of false triggers, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to move it to a variety of locations to confirmWHAT I DON&rsquo;T LIKE- My biggest complaint is that this takes a narrower picture than I am accustomed to.- 2.4 second trigger time as opposed to the 0.6 second trigger time claim- 8 second recovery time (time between pictures/videos) based on my testing. This is well below the industry average of 4-5 seconds (some are in the 2 second range)- 40-45 ft detection range which is average or a bit below average for PIR sensors in game cameras- This camera has a strap with a plastic buckle. I prefer a metal clip for easy removal and positioning.ON PAR WITH MOST CAMERAS:o 5.25&rdquo; x 3.5&rdquo; x 2.5&rdquo; - Not the smallest, but on par with most on the marketo Durability seems on par with other cameras I’ve used - I&rsquo;m not sure how the plastic bracket on the back will hold up long-term. For now, I can&rsquo;t knock it.o Battery Life seems standardo Video file size is about 12MB for a 5-second video on the highest resolutiono Night pictures are close to average - not great, but not horribleCONCLUSION:I&rsquo;m quite torn on how to rate this camera. It has a lot of positives: LCD screen, quality day pictures/videos with great audio. It might have the best audio of any game camera I&rsquo;ve used! I really like using the LCD screen in the field for checking pictures without a computer and needing to switch SD cards.There are certainly a couple things I don&rsquo;t like including narrow pictures and a slower trigger time stated. I would like to see the strap and plastic buckle changed. It’s just a pet peeve of mine to have to use a plastic buckle strap. I would like to see the actual trigger time and recovery time drop to be competitive with other cameras. I&rsquo;d also like to see detection range increase a bit.This is certainly a serviceable camera. I like this camera, but, like ANY other game camera, I think there are areas for improvement. Each camera excels in some things and slacks at others. If you know how to use this camera, it can be very efficient for hunting (or potentially other applications). If I can help with any questions, I am happy to do so!FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) DISCLAIMER:I received this product for free or purposes of testing and reviewing.

<h5 id="good-camera-for-different-uses">Good Camera for Different Uses!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Distianert Trail Camera was very nice and my husband was excited to get it. It has the Open door compartment that has a viewing screen on the inside so you can view your pictures right then. I would recommend that you order your memory card when you order your camera so you can put it to use when you receive it because you need it to set up your camera. I like how it displays the time and date of your pictures. It is motioned sensored so it captures things in walking pass or in the area of the camera. We got this camera as a security camera to take pictures of things coming and going in our backyard so we can see and have better pictures at night. It comes with different mounts or straps to attach it to trees or poles. It is perfect for hunting or video/picture surveillance. The instructions was also pretty easy to follow making using this camera great. Please note the megapixels are 12mp not 16mp. Still a good camera.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera-great-value">Great Camera, Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this camera about 3 months ago. used the camera mostly to take pictures of Hummingbirds which I did. The cam took really good daytime pictures of the little birds. Triggered OK as well so I caught most of the action. In these efforts I used the selection/s 2 pictures + customer selected time video. This setting worked really well. So far I have been very satisfied with the unit.Please note: Amazon on their DH-8 page has this unit paired up with the wrong SD card. Be aware that this unit takes the MINI SD Card.Overall construction and design&hellip;Good construction and design, however, I would like to see the access to the micro SD card easier to remove and install as this would facilitate removing the card without disturbing the camera alignment. The wall mount that came with the unit is adequate but I think that the brass <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; mounting nut embedded in the plastic bracket on camera back could be a little beefier in design with a little more depth of thread.Over all I like the unit and reserve the right to possibly raise the stars to 5 after some real use under my belt. I do feel, at this time, that the unit has really good value for the money.Well it is six months or more later and I have used the camera off and on during that time. The camera takes beautiful clear pictures and triggers equally well. Great product and I am raising the star to = 5.Something I found refreshing is that the instructions are written in plain consistent/concise [very important in technical instruction,] English and are very informative.</p>
