<h5 id="it-doesn-t-actually-track-where-you-re-brushing-but-it-s-still-a-good-brush">It doesn&rsquo;t actually track where you&rsquo;re brushing, but it&rsquo;s still a good brush.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DISAPPOINTMENTS:It doesn&rsquo;t actually sense where you are in your mouth. With the app up, it tells you where to brush (one of 6 sections), and only senses whether you&rsquo;re on the inside our the outside of that section. &hellip;That&rsquo;s it. And it doesn&rsquo;t even do that very reliably. The inside of my top left side of my mouth rarely detects properly, leaving the app to falsely report that I need to spend more time there.The &ldquo;touch up&rdquo; and the &ldquo;modes&rdquo; that it offers tweak nothing but how long it stays on. If you buy a brush that doesn&rsquo;t have these features, you can mimic them by just turning the brush on again after it shuts off.THINGS I ENDED UP LIKINGI didn&rsquo;t expect to want to be able to adjust the intensity. I&rsquo;ve been an E-Series user for decades and never needed it. However, my gums started to get sore after using this new brush on high, so I switched it to medium. Now that they&rsquo;re healed, high is OK again. &hellip;but it&rsquo;s nice to have the option.The app poorly detecting where I&rsquo;m brushing is a gimmick at best. However, after I&rsquo;m done brushing, the app asks &ldquo;did you floss? did you rinse? did you scrape?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s silly, but knowing that I&rsquo;d have to press the &ldquo;no&rdquo; button has persuaded me to floss rinse and scrape far more often than I used to. I consider that a win.Also, the app yells at you if you move your brush too quickly–and this is by far my greatest offender. I have apparently been moving my brush far too much over the past decade, and the app is convincing me to slow it down. It&rsquo;s a tough habit to break, but I&rsquo;m only aware of it because of this bluetooth model.Overall, I&rsquo;m pleased, and expect to get 5-10 years of brushing out of it.UPDATE JANUARY 2017:The &ldquo;brushing too quickly&rdquo; detection that I thought was so helpful now seems kind of ridiculous. The brush is vibrating at 500+ strokes per second, but me adding 3 additional strokes per second is going to leave my teeth dirty? I get that I don&rsquo;t HAVE to stroke with this brush, but I can&rsquo;t see why someone should pay extra for a bluetooth model with an app just so they can curb the habit.I rarely use the app now. I get a notification every 2 weeks to tell me to brush with the app so that it can &ldquo;sync&rdquo; and track my brush life, and I do so, but the novelty of the bluetooth feature has worn off. I brush my teeth twice a day, I don&rsquo;t need an app to tell me that it&rsquo;s time to replace a head–I can just do the math. This is a solid brush and works great, but If I could do it again, I&rsquo;d save my $$ and skip the bluetooth.</p>

<h5 id="platinum-vs-plus-vs-diamondclean">Platinum Vs. Plus Vs. DiamondClean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Flexcare Plus, Platinum (this one), and DiamondClean are the three top of the line (in order listed) models. I thought at first that the Platinum was an additional offering, but since the Plus is no longer featured on Philips&rsquo; website, it looks like it is being replaced altogether by the Platinum. This is disappointing to me since I favor the Plus over the other two (despite it&rsquo;s lower cost), and view it as a sort of &ldquo;bench-mark&rdquo; or gold standard of Sonicare toothbrushes. That said, each of course, have their own set of pros and cons. Also of course, this is the new &ldquo;connected&rdquo; version that works with your smartphone via the free App.note: Even though it appears that the PLUS model is being phased out, I include it in this review for comparison purposes and because it still seems to be available for purchase, and in case it is made available again in some form in the future.The first and MOST IMPORTANT thing to know: Any of the Philips Sonicare brushes can be used with any of the models. Of course, the brushes are where &ldquo;the rubber meets the road&rdquo;, so to speak. Knowing this, you are free to choose a brush handle based solely on it&rsquo;s features and design.The UV SANITIZER versions were/are available with both the Plus and Platinum models. Obviously this adds a bit to the cost, so one should weigh the Sanitizer&rsquo;s importance and usefulness to them. Personally, I LIKE having it, though admittedly I find myself just not using it very much. Of course it also adds quite a bit to the footprint of the toothbrush versus the small charging base, which takes up very little space.COMPARISONSPerformanceAs far as their capability of performing their intended function, that obviously being the cleaning of your teeth, I have to say that the three models all seem pretty equal on those terms. There is one listed distinction, however, between the newest Platinum model and the DiamondCare and Plus. The Platinum model is apparently capable of a little bit of a higher intensity than the other two models. Philips states the following about the Platinum: &ldquo;Philips Sonicare&rsquo;s best ever plaque removal: up to 10x more than a manual toothbrush&rdquo;. The other two models are listing 7x more plaque removal than a manual toothbrush. I cannot speak to the accuracy of this claim, but I can say that I have used all three models one after the other on their highest intensity settings and I cannot perceive any difference in intensity or in the way that they perform.ErgonomicsThere are some definite differences here. In this regard, the Plus model scores the highest in my opinion. This is because of it&rsquo;s curves as well as due to the back portion of it&rsquo;s handle being made of a rubber-like material. It feels the most comfortable to hold and is the easiest to grip. Both the Platinum and Diamond models are cylindrical in shape and have forgone the rubber handle for all plastic, with the Diamond being completely smooth on all sides and the Platinum using raised &ldquo;dots&rdquo; to help with grip.DesignIn addition to the ergonomic differences already mentioned, their additional individual design features are what set them apart the most from each other. This is also probably the most subjective area to be considered as some may love certain design aspects that other will not like at all.The DiamondClean model is of minimalist design. When I first saw it, I called &ldquo;The i-phone of toothbrushes&rdquo;. It is all white with some chrome accents. It has a very appealing modern and clean look. The glass charger is of course very cool whether or not you actually use the glass for rinsing and not just charging. The single button operation is both a plus and minus for me. It is a plus because it is as simple as you can get in operation-one button turns it on, adjusts mode, and turns it off. It is a minus because you cannot simply turn it off too soon after turning it on. Once you turn it on, if you push the button it again cycles through it&rsquo;s cleaning modes. If you want or need to turn it off within ten or so seconds after turning it on, the only way to do that is to first cycle through the five modes. I find this annoying. I like to be able to turn things on and off easily and as needed.The Platinum model uses three buttons for control. It&rsquo;s use is very intuitive. They have added a three level intensity setting button in addition to the mode button. I think that most people will simply use the highest setting unless they are first-time users or have particularly sensitive teeth. What I do not like is the design of the buttons here. There is a space all around the three buttons, whereas the buttons of the other two models are fairly sealed. This means that gunk will inevitably get into those spaces, potentially causing problems or at the least requiring tedious cleaning. Tiny green LED indicator lights indicate level and mode.The Plus model uses two buttons for control- one being an on and off button and the other to cycle through five cleaning modes. Operation is very simple and intuitive and is my favorite in this regard. The buttons are pretty well sealed.Bluetooth &ldquo;Connected&rdquo; FeatureOf course this Platinum is the only model with this feature. This seems like a pretty cool and novel idea, but I really wonder how often I (or most people) will ever use it once the novelty wears off. Downloading the App and pairing with the tootbrush was very simple. I am still experimenting with this feature and will add more thoughts here.SummaryThe Platinum Sonicare is a very good toothbrush that performs well, with some design changes over the Plus model which I do not favor by comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated Review 10/4/16Originally i gave this a one star because the app to connect the toothbrush to the iphone would always crash my iphone. I always had good things to say about the toothbrush but if it didn&rsquo;t work with the app what good was it? I actually deleted the app from my phone entirely. Then i checked back and saw that they had issued an update to the Apple app, so i downloaded it again to test it. FINALLY they have a successful application that works perfectly with the blue tooth on my iphone. After testing it successfully for a few weeks i came back here an changed my review to 5 stars because it all works seamlessly as it should have from the start.</p>

<h5 id="great-slim-electric-toothbrush">Great Slim Electric Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great electric toothbrush. I upgraded from Sonicate&rsquo;s Essence series and am very happy with this model; it&rsquo;s slimmer and has a smaller counter footprint. I have not used the app and bluetooth functionality, but suffice it say if you want to get highly analytical with your brushing this is the one to get. I do like the sensor that throttles it back if you brush too aggressively. It also has a nice beginner mode if you&rsquo;re new to electric toothbrushes&hellip;it helps you ease into the (very different) sensation of power brushing. I haven&rsquo;t traveled with it yet but I like the travel case very much. Overall highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="stopped-working-after-7-weeks">Stopped working after 7 weeks</h5>
