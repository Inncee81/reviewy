<h5 id="proffessional-grade-quality-very-impressed">Proffessional Grade Quality, Very Impressed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I installed 2 of these brackets today. One in my bathroom and one in my basement. They are made of steel, which is heavy. You can tell you have a quality product when you pick it up. The bracket comes with 2 anchors, 2 mounting screws, and a mounting bolt that is hand screwed into the back of the SONOS: Play 1 speaker, which hooks onto the bracket once it&rsquo;s mounted on the wall. It also comes with nice little screw covers which go over the screw heads once the bracket is mounted so you can&rsquo;t see the screws. You will need a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; drill bit, a cordless drill, and a hammer to install the anchors. The screws are phillips head so you&rsquo;ll need a phillips head screwdriver to screw in the screws and make adjustments. It&rsquo;s very simple.I originally had the SONOS: Play 1 speaker downstairs sitting on a table next to my workout bench. I have a finished basement btw, with carpet and a finished ceiling. I mention that because it may affect the quality of sound if you don&rsquo;t have drywall or carpet in your basement and plan to put one of these down there you may get some echo. Mounting this speaker to the wall not only clears up space and allows me to get rid of that table, but also seems to do a better job of filling the room with sound since the speaker is mounted a bit higher, and points down.The bracket swivels up, down, left and right. You can point the speaker in any direction you want. The nice thing about it is that you can then tighten the bracket with a phillips head screwdriver so that whichever position you want the speaker in it will stay that way. This bracket has also allowed me to mount this speaker in my bathroom close to the ceiling, clear of any water splashes during vigorous showers :), and I LOVE to listen to music in the shower. Since the SONOS:Play1 is moisture resistant, I can shower stress free with super hot water like I like it knowing the speaker is going to be just fine mounted there on my wall.I would highly recommend this bracket for anyone looking to clear up some space with their sonos system or even if you&rsquo;re looking for a more tidy look. I can see myself purchasing several more of these in the future.</p>

<h5 id="nice-little-mounts">Nice little mounts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little mounts. Small enough to hide behind the speakers and disappear. There&rsquo;s even a little foam on the piece on the part that makes contact with the Sonos - keep things snug and prevents scratches. My only critique is the screws that came with the kit aren&rsquo;t the best. If I didn&rsquo;t have an impact driver and leaning on them while driving them in, I would&rsquo;ve stripped out the head of the screws. Thats my only complaint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-brackets">Good Brackets!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised. Small bracket holds up the heavy play 1s very well. The bracket also articulates the speaker in many different directions allowing the speaker to point in the direction you want and also look level. Easy to articulate the speaker when mounted without getting tools and it will still stay in place</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="changed-review-to-5-star-as-i-had-improperly-installed-the-unit-properly-installed-all-works-great-and-i-wiuld-purchase-again">Changed review to 5 star as I had improperly installed the unit. Properly installed all works great and I wiuld purchase again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unit works great if properly installed. I had previously rated this product a 1 star, but must change to 5 star as I had improperly installed the unit. My thanks and appreciation of their customer service that very politely but insistant corrected my mistake. Emvarassing to me but very thankful. Definitely will use this product and vendor in the future</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-wall-mount-for-sonos-play-1">Great wall mount for Sonos Play 1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and mount the speaker compared to other versions I tried. This wall mount is made well, and works well in tight corners. At this great price I purchased 5 of them to mount each of my Sonos Play 1 speakers. The sound quality is definitely better with the speaker mounted higher on the wall, than just sitting on a table, and keeps it out of the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-sonos-play-1-wall-mount">Perfect Sonos Play 1 Wall Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These brackets are perfect. They are easy to put up - 5 minutes with a hole punch, Phillips head screwdriver, and the wrench provided. They mount the speakers firmly but they can be swiveled up or down and they hold them in place. These brackets are very well designed and a breeze to install.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sonos-play-1-mount">Great Sonos Play 1 Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall it&rsquo;s a great speaker mount for my Play 1. I give a 4 star review as I&rsquo;d like to see more than a 15 degrees downward tilt and the ability to lock the screws in a bit tighter to prevent and future sway / tilt. There is some nice foam on the mount where it touches the speaker, but none for wall contact. Initial installation yielded vibration against the wall, but with a small dampener between the mount and wall, it was eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-wall-mount-for-sonos-play-1-1">Great Wall Mount for Sonos Play 1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product works great to mount my two Play 1&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m using as rear speakers in my surround sound system. Product came as advertised as is very easy to install. If you need to mount a Play 1 this is for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-pains-of-installing">Not worth the pains of installing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect any clever engineering here. When mounted near a corner, these are nearly impossible to install with Sonos Play 3 speakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good product easy to install</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great well made product, easy to install!</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-mount-and-actually-helps-the-acoustics">Easy to mount and actually helps the acoustics&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t install this but it looks good and the manager said it was super easy to mount. He said mounting it up high, actually made the speaker sound better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrible-design-immediate-issue-is-that-you-or-your">Terrible design. Immediate issue is that you or your &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have installed about 200 Playbars and Sonos brand mount. When they were out of stock I ordered 3 of these. Terrible design.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the job</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-design-and-quality">Great design and quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great design and quality. I hate poor quality items, this one certainly did not disappoint me. It&rsquo;s expensive, but I don&rsquo;t paying more for good design and better quality.</p>

<p>These were very easy to install and look fine. No complaints.</p>
