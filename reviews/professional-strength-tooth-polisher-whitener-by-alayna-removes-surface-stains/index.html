<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a retired dentist, so I don&rsquo;t have access to the goodies I used to have in my office anymore. A lower incisor of mine is set back a bit so it catches a lot of tea and coffee stain. This works great to get the stain off.The one I received has sufficient torque to bear down as much as I need it to. Those having problems with stalling out or the cup not turning might try a fresh battery, or make sure there is no moisture under the cup when you snap it on. Mine worked perfectly.Certainly not a substitute for a professional cleaning, it&rsquo;s most useful for the front teeth to keep plaque and stain from accumulating. Toothpaste can be a bit messy, so you can stiffen it up with some baking soda if you can&rsquo;t beg some prophy paste from your dentist. And be careful, if you&rsquo;re heating the tooth, you&rsquo;re overdoing it. Depending how abrasive your polish is, I wouldn&rsquo;t advise using it more than once a week to reduce stains, especially if you have white fillings up front.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-product-there-s-a-technique-i-found-which-works-for-me">I love this product. There&rsquo;s a technique I found which works for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The people who complain that it stops when you press it on your teeth do not know and understand that it&rsquo;s better for them this way. Even with the unit stopping, I can still get my teeth &ldquo;too hot&rdquo; if I&rsquo;m not careful, so I can only imagine the damage a more powerful tool might cause. I love it just the way it is. I use it by pressing half-second &ldquo;taps&rdquo; which are very effective because it almost stops under pressure but then I release it and just as it starts to gain speed again I press it and it slows down again, and so on. This method works exceptionally well for me. I actually didn&rsquo;t expect much since it had mixed reviews, but I&rsquo;m glad I bought it. I make my own paste with the following ingredients: natural tooth paste, one cap of teeth polish, teaspoon of coconut oil, and a few caps of activated charcoal. Love it.</p>

<h5 id="removes-plaque-in-seconds-when-a-sonicare-toothbrush-wouldn-t-very-surprised">Removes plaque in seconds when a Sonicare toothbrush wouldn&rsquo;t. Very Surprised.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product!!! For the results, the price is amazing! &hellip; I use a sonicare toothbrush every day and I have a couple problem areas where stains develop&hellip; I will hold the toothbrush there forever and they dont come off. I also use listerine every day and brush the listerine into the stains. No luck&hellip;. I am not kidding&hellip; This thing cleaned those areas ON CONTACT&hellip; Like 2 seconds&hellip; I read reviews ahead of time and took the advice of someone who said they were a dentist. I am glad that I didn&rsquo;t listen to the negative reviews&hellip; Some of them are scary and say you can damage your teeth if you hold it too long. The cups at the end are made up of really soft rubbery material that bends and flexes when it touches your tooth.. so the edge of the cup can actually clean the area right in between two teeth to an extent.. Not like flossing but pretty close where the inside edges touch&hellip; I have a really small mouth, and I was still able to get it to my very back tooth and once again it cleaned on contact.. it was not easy to get it back there&hellip;. it was hard to prevent it from touching my lip because my mouth is so small&hellip; but with some effort I did it.. it took a couple minutes to get the technique down. I imagine if you have a wider mouth it would be easy.. It depends on what you are using it for and the size of your mouth. I am not speaking on its whitening ability, because I just used it for the first time before I wrote this.. but it took off stuff in seconds that my $80 toothbrush won&rsquo;t budge. So I am actually amazed.. I think that maybe people who gave it negative reviews are trying to actually whiten their teeth and maybe it doesn&rsquo;t work great for that, I don&rsquo;t know yet&hellip; but as far as plaque removal and stains it was great&hellip; I mean, I use a metal scraping tool on those areas and it would take forever and be very difficult. This thing does it in a second! Not exaggerating. I think for whitening, maybe just use <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> water and hydrogen peroxide as a rinse on your teeth before you brush&hellip;</p>

<p>In the description it said that it was a rubber tip, it is NOT rubber. It&rsquo;s PLASTIC. I am not rubbing something hard as a rock and plastic on my teeth!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so happy when this arrived. But I couldn&rsquo;t get mine to turn on. Somehow, long before I bought it &hellip;&hellip;batteries had exploded inside the battery chamber. Now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-so">so-so</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the product came with no batteries contrary to what was shown by the picture; it is too large to fit inside your mouth to polish the inside of your teeth; the speed of the motor&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="avoid">Avoid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very cheaply made and difficult to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-it">Not worth it.</h5>

<p>Product quit working in little over a month . It&rsquo;s a piece of junk.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-at-all-what-i-would-use-on-my-teeth">Not at all what I would use on my teeth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thought for some reason the polishing tip would be softer. It was made of a hard plastic that hurt my teeth and felt like it could break my teeth. The item seemed very cheap.</p>

<p>works as expected for 20.00. Batteries not included in my order</p>
