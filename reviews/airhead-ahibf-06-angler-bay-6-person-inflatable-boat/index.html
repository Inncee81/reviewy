<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-boat-but-we-did-buy-it-knowing-that-it-would-realistically-not-hold-as-many-people-as-it-claims">very happy with this boat &ndash; but we did buy it knowing that it would realistically not hold as many people as it claims.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband did extensive research on inflatable boats, and ultimately settled on this one. His one comment to me, while we awaited its arrival? Something along the lines of this:&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hold as many people as it claims, otherwise this boat is awesome.&ldquo;And to that I agree. We comfortably had two adults and three smaller children in the boat, plus some waterproof bags (Mava Sports Compact and Lightweight Dry Bag - Water Resistant Sack for outdoor activities during Summer or Winter, Green 15L). I wouldn&rsquo;t put more people in it than that.Our kids loved the inflatable seat cushions.Things we added on:- pump for inflating (none is included): AIRHEAD AHP-12H Hi Output Air Pump (12-Volt)- oars: AIRHEAD AHIB-53 Oars (1 Pair), White, 53-InchI&rsquo;ll let you peruse the other reviews for more thorough info, but I just wanted to add our two cents and say we are very happy with this boat &ndash; but we did buy it knowing that it would realistically not hold as many people as it claims.If we encounter any issues using this boat, I&rsquo;ll update this post. Otherwise assume we&rsquo;re very happy!</p>

<h5 id="great-boat-it-s-a-lot-of-fun-and-does">Great boat! It&rsquo;s a lot of fun and does &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great boat! It&rsquo;s a lot of fun and does to job for angler&rsquo;s of any age. If you are going to use it for fishing, it fits 2 grown adults + 2 children very comfortably with enough room for tackle and cooler. Without tackle and cooler, me and my 5 kids fit just fine to go for a ride.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-rod-holders-were-really-nice-it-was-quick-to-blow-up-and-easy">The rod holders were really nice. It was quick to blow up and easy &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fit 2 short adults a small dog and a tall tween but you have to watch how stuff you bring. It can get full fast. The oar holes are placed in an odd spot so it&rsquo;s a bit hard to maneuver if it&rsquo;s windy. Our first trip was a bit ambitious in a med. sized lake and the wind picked up blowing us to shore (Thankfully not to the other side of the lake!), (The 10lb mushroom anchor wouldn&rsquo;t hold us) The second trip in very calm river was much more pleasant. I&rsquo;d suggest a small back back pack for supplies/fishing but no more. The rod holders were really nice. It was quick to blow up and easy to stow away. I saw somebody with another boat (I think it was the intrepid) it was a lot longer than mine and fit their whole family but the tall walls and multiple cells definitely made me feel safer when the white caps picked up out of nowhere on the lake. Just remember these are a step up from a pool toy and not made for rough water.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-fit-comfortably-with-my-two-teen-girls">I fit comfortably with my two teen girls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lost a star because it def does not fit 6 adults. I fit comfortably with my two teen girls. easy to inflate although i would like to see a tire thing on it so i can fill with a good compressor&hellip;i used the compressor that came with my mattress and it worked fine. filled fast. deflated fast as well. Went out twice on the lake with it and it was perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-boat-but-small">good boat, but small</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>bought it at amazon on prime day. i inflated it at home. everything is ok, but inflation gauge is not working. i could live without it. it is definitely small. internal dimension is 27 inch by 7 feet, which is a joke to hold 6 people. i would say 2 adults and 2 kids are at max. feel it is sturdy. soft bottom makes me nervous, but i used a soft-bottomed Intex which holds up quite well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hard-enough-for-lake">Hard enough for lake,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using it with a 3o lb minkota electric trolley custom made .Great pvc gauge .3 air chambere enough security and stability.Include an hard floor and by the price you have a great inflatable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-happy-with-it">I&rsquo;m happy with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the most part, I&rsquo;m happy with it. So far its been durable and serves its purpose there are one or two design flaws. When you sit on the back to control the trolling motor the rod holder tilts the poles towards each other. Its not quite as stable as I hoped even with a sheet of plywood in the bottom. I compared reviews and so far I feel confident I made the right pick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-boat-do-not-like-the-placement-of-the">Good boat. Do not like the placement of the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good boat. Do not like the placement of the grab handles; when you have a trolling motor mounted or the transom mount on it is impossible to grab a hold of the rear handle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-worth-the-money">Well worth the money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a great quality raft this is the one. Holds up great. Super sturdy and awesome quality. We&rsquo;ve been very happy with it !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-boat-for-the-price">Nice boat for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice boat for the price. So far made about 8 fishing trips. It is holding up good. However, the seats are not comfortable and oars could use improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great boat. Fits two people comfortably, with two small dogs in the middle. Good quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-boat-itself-is-awesome-very-stable-and-great-to-fish-from">The boat itself is awesome! Very stable and great to fish from</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sportsman&rsquo;s Guide, where the boat came from, was very helpful. They also responded very quickly to my inquiries. The boat itself is awesome!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-quite-the-fish-hunter">Not quite the &ldquo;fish hunter&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We from the fish hunter to this model, as it&rsquo;s a bit cheaper. The only real difference is the two extra air chambers under the sides of the fish hunter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-raft-but-to-get-6-8-people-at-most-only-3-can-be-adults">Good raft but to get 6-8 people, at most, only 3 can be adults.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Holds 4 adults at most. Our previous Seahawks raft had more room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="raft-has-small-cuts-all-over-it-not-sure">Raft has small cuts all over it. Not sure &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Raft has small cuts all over it. Not sure how sea-worthy it will be. Also note, this raft is very long and the oar locks require extra long oars if you are not tall. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;5&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="make-sure-you-understand-what-you-re-getting-into">Make sure you understand what you&rsquo;re getting into</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m pretty baffled by the good reviews of this. Maybe I was just naive in my expectations, but the boat is not useable in its current form.</p>
