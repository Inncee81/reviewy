<h5 id="my-review-of-the-lg-sj9">My Review of the LG SJ9</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first sound bar Ive ever owned. Coming from a 7.1 surround sound system which was advertised at 1200W total. That being said, that system was first purchased over 5 years. In tears of power, if someone had told me that this sound bar was rated at 1200W I would of believed them. I compared this one to the competition, the Samsung Atmos bar HW-K950 which released around the same time. I was able to test out both of them at the local best buy. Power wise they were very similar although in terms of build I felt the LG one is far more stylish.<strong>OVERALL SOUND</strong>I have the bar setup with my LG OLED55E6, voices and lows sound great and really add to any show you may be watching.The bar comes with several preset options, movie,music, bass boost to name a few. I usually have the volume between 8-15 on movie mode. I feel movie mode has the best balance between highs,lows and voice. At 8 you have a moderate loudness but at 15 the sound bar is really starts showing what it can do. Only gripe so far is that the overall sound seems to suffer when set below 10 while gaming. Halo for instance, gunshots will sound very slightly muffled but once set to 12 or higher they are as crisp as can be. I should note many people will probably never notice this, its very slight and its probably the audiophile in me. Bluetooth functionality on this is a breeze to setup and can be blasting music from youre phone. I cant speak for the LG app as I never use it as I keep all my music on my phone.<strong>ATMOS AND SURROUND SOUND</strong>*Using the ARC (Audio Return Channel) hooked up via HDMI from my TV. Set up is a breeze by the way.Ive played Star Trek into Darkness as well as a few youtube videos which &ldquo;should&rdquo; be putting out an ATMOS signal. I can definitely say the soundbar does a very decent job of simulating a surround environment. Ive gone as far as putting my ear onto the upward firing drivers, which put out higher pitched sounds. I believe this is to better be able to bounce the audio off my ceiling. While it doesn&rsquo;t compare to my previous 7.1 surround it believe it does an 8 out of 10 job in regards to this. There have been several instances in my gaming and movies were sound does appear to be coming from around you.Hope this review helps anyone who may be looking for a new sound bar.Ill leave a few stars in some more specific categories.POWER - 5 OUT OF 5SURROUND + ATMOS 4 OUT OF 5EASE OF USE - 5 OUT OF 5LOOKS - 5 OUT OF 5 - I simply love the look of this thing.</p>

<h5 id="a-good-soundbar-for-old-people-like-me">A good soundbar for old people like me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far it seems great. Can hear and understand the voices in high action parts of 4k movies for the first time. Have maybe 2000 dvds and the old ones sound clear. The new doby atmos one will blow your mind. Had a 5.1 sound system and never though I would spend the money for a soundbar. I am sure glad I got this soundbar.P.S. lf you download lgs instructions on the web You should beable to solve almost any setup problems.</p>

<h5 id="really-like-it-sound-is-really-clear">Really like it. Sound is really clear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really like it. Sound is really clear. Pairing this with my OPPO 4k Player and my LG OLED C6.Sound is phenomenal. Do I get total Atmos Surround? Answer-Sometimes, yes. But I do have a ceiling fan, chairs and other things in the way of bouncing off walls and ceiling. But the overall sound is really great. Definitely the best sound bar set up at this $750 price range, regardless of how badly you desire wall bouncing sounds. But every once in a while I say &ldquo;Wow, that sound came from over there, so it&rsquo;s definitely working in surround.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sounds-great">Sounds great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price I paid, I think that this soundbar sounds great! My previous soundbar was only 2.1 and I can definitely tell the difference on this soundbar when listening to dialogue in tv shows/movies. I currently have this soundbar in a medium size living room and even though the volume goes all the way up to 40 I usually keep it around 16 to 18. I think that for most content the movie sound mode sounds the best. The bass on the included subwoofer is very powerful. The volume on the subwoofer ranges from -15 to +6 and I usually keep it set to +3 or 4. This soundbar is also very compatible with my LG 4k tv and Xbox One S. Unlike my previous Sony soundbar, I&rsquo;ve had no HDCP handshake issues while watching 4k content. When setting up the soundbar I learned that I had to use the LG Music Flow app on my phone to connect it to my wifi and update it. One minor issue I have with this soundbar is that there is only one HDMI IN port. That&rsquo;s a little annoying because I have a Roku and an Xbox One S. I worked around this problem by using the ARC functionality on soundbar by connecting it to my tv&rsquo;s ARC HDMI port and then connecting my roku to another HDMI port on my tv.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-features-and-just-1-wire">Great sound, features and just 1 wire</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound, features and just 1 wire! Just know its not equal to a 5.1 or 7.1 full surround system. I&rsquo;m a convert. I doubt i&rsquo;ll go back to the big surround systems. If u can find this soundbar for approx. $700 or less, its a great buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="top-notch-sound-bar">Top Notch Sound bar!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this sound bar to pair with my LG 65 C7P. Together they are the total home video and audio package. The sound is incredible. Voices are clear no matter the volume level. The highs are crisp and the mid range is full. The bass is punchy and never muddy. If your looking for the best, then make this your next purchase.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-a-small-room">Good for a small room</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice detailed sounding sound bar. Tv was not that loud even at full volume. Good enough for a small room.Movies. It will light the room up pretty good. Still vocals are not that loud. Louder than tv. Atmos. Opens up very expansive sound. Sound modesAsc. Movie got very loudMovie. Sounded very natural with tv and movie.Standard. Sounded weak.Bass boost. Sounds good for. Music. Adds a boomy effect. Not to good for tv or movies. It&rsquo;s a shame to because it fires the 2 top atmos speaks up. Just gives a restricted boomy sound.My hook up is everything through a HDMI switch. 1080p. No 4k yet.I did experience trouble using the LG music flow app. Found the sound bar but would not connect to my Wi-Fi.Had to use the manual setup wireless set up. Doing this I could update the system.Could not use the music programs though. Google play our art radio ext.I did hook up through bluetooth without any problems.</p>
