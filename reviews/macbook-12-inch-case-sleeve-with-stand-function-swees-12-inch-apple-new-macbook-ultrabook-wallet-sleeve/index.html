<h5 id="perfect-fit-awesome-sleeve">Perfect fit, awesome sleeve!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This met my expectations and then some! I bought the felt sleeve and it is the perfect sleeve for backpacks and briefcases w/out dedicated computer padding. I read through a lot of product reviews and was looking for a case that fit the new 12in Macbook perfectly. It seems like a lot of other products were &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; to fit the new size but did not fit the 12in MB exactly. This case is specifically made for the 12in MB and fits PERFECTLY. I was looking for lightweight, perfect fit, decent protection, and additional accessory pockets. This has them all. What was a pleasant surprise was the secondary pocket that can fit the iPad Air 2 along with the 12in MB.I&rsquo;ve posted a couple of pictures for reference w/ computer and iPad inside.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-apple-macbook-12-2015-retina-sleeve-awesome-communication">I love this Apple MacBook 12&rdquo; (2015-) Retina Sleeve, awesome communication.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a review of the wool felt version. Nicely designed. Nice use of materials, provides simple protection while the computer is in a bag. External pockets are fine for headphones, small adapters, business cards, etc. the company seems to really care about hearing about the quality and design of their product and has been in touch since I previously rated their shipping. I highly recommend this sleeve for the new 2015 Macbook 12&rdquo; and the company in general.I would also like to add my thoughts to some of the complaints/issues I read. One was that it did not fit their 11 inch computer. Although it&rsquo;s true 11 inches is smaller than 12, that is only the diagonal measurement of the screen size. (The MacBook Air 11&rdquo; model actually has a 11.6&rdquo; screen. The actual measurements of the whole 11&rdquo; MacBook Air are .68&rdquo; thick 11.8&rdquo; wide, by 7.56&rdquo; deep (front to back). This contrast with the new 2015 MacBook 12&rdquo; dimensions of .52&rdquo; thick, 11.04&rdquo; wide, and 7.74&rdquo; deep. Clearly a case like this, which is designed only for MacBook 12&rdquo; would not accommodate the 11&rdquo; MacBook Air.The other issue someone had was odor. I have the wool felt version. I cannot speak for the PU &ldquo;Leather&rdquo; version. So when I received mine, I did not notice anything unusual, it smells like wool, which has a faint musty smell to it which I prefer over any synthetic plastic fiber smell anyday. In fact, that was the allure of this product for me in the first place. Wool can also be expected to have more smell when wet, or in humid conditions. Now if someone receives a product that has a smell other than the wool smell I described than I would contact the company. My experience with them has been limited but very positive.</p>

<h5 id="wow">WOW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is awesome. I was skeptical at first because of the low cost, but this has surprised me. Very high quality materials. My 12 inch MacBook and iPad Air fit perfectly inside. My iPhone 6 plus even fits in one of the back pockets with another pocket for a charger. I would recommend this sleeve to anyone with a 12 inch MacBook.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-fit-pockets-are-a-good-bonus-great-price">Nice fit, pockets are a good bonus, great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this for my new MacBook One, the Retina 12&rdquo;, and it is really nice. The MacBook fits snug inside and feels reasonably protected. Its not as think or padded as some other sleeves that I&rsquo;ve used with other Mac&rsquo;s, but for $7 I can&rsquo;t really complain. I bought the gray felt one and I like the look and feel of it. The added pockets is new to me in a sleeve, and they are very useful. To carry an iPhone or a cord, or even an iPad mini, it adds a lot of versatility.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-it-don-t-hesitate">Get it!!! Don&rsquo;t hesitate.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely love this sleeve. While it&rsquo;s not an exact match to the rose pink hue of my MacBook, it&rsquo;s pretty darn close. Since I got them, I have traveled to 4 different continents and 13 different countries in the last 8 weeks. I got tons of compliments on both across the board.Note: Since I went through a plethora of security checks over my travels, I realized that if not careful when pulling /pushing the case in and out of my carry-ons it could likely get tiny dog ears. That was user error on my part and nothing to do with the integrity of the sleeve. I&rsquo;m still madly in love with my case/sleeve.Note 2: If you travel internationally (especially to Asian or Middle Eastern countries, save yourself the trouble and keep all your cables, charging ports and external chargers handy. Cameras are also passed through the scanners one by one as they are LITERALLY scrutinized one by one! (Repetition for effect). It can be tedious and annoying. I therefore picked up a clear pouch while in Singapore so I can easily find the chargers they requested (pictured in the review shot).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dark-gray-beware-terrible-quality">DARK GRAY BEWARE. Terrible quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: The company has good customer service and sent me another for free. Unfortunately the same problem is occurring with this Dark Grey item. Pictures attached. The poor quality is the same again on this second shipment as the first- described below. With all of the positive reviews, it must just be a problem with the Dark Gray item. This also used to be a separate listing, but because of the bad reviews, they combined it with other product offerings so it looks like overall they are getting majority 5 stars. It might be fair for their other products, but not this one.Terrible quality. The lining is sticking out of the sides. That flush siding that is shown in the picture is not like that at all. Imagine a PB&amp;J sandwich with the PB and J gushing out of the middle of the two pieces of bread. There&rsquo;s also a weird glue that has dried on the seams.</p>

<p>Received the case today and it is very nice. I like how its a stand as well as a sleeve. Issue is my mac won&rsquo;t fit inside the sleeve with the case that I have on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-slim-fit-case">Great Slim-fit Case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great case for my Macbook. It&rsquo;s close fitting and does not add bulk. It acts as a convenient stand and so my mac doesn&rsquo;t slide around when I&rsquo;m using it.</p>
