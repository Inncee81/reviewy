<h5 id="great-product-once-you-find-the-right-size">Great product, once you find the right size!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got a pair of these tips with MEE M6 Pro musician&rsquo;s monitors and quite frankly wasn&rsquo;t terribly impressed with the fit or comfort when I first tried them, but I looked up the individual product and learned I had to smash them down as small as possible and THEN put them in my ear so they&rsquo;d swell up and fill the ear canal.Wow, what a difference reading the instructions makes.After that they fit in my ear perfectly and I found that the T-200 Medium was my size and perfect comfort&hellip;.so perfect that the noise isolation is almost flawless even without noise cancelling and so comfortable I can and have slept with these on at night for a full 8 hours and had no sore spots or fatigue when I woke up.With a perfect fit these tips can make average headphones sound great, and great headphones sound amazing. Thundering bass, super clear highs and smooth mid tones. I listen to all types of music (except country) and these tips help every type of music sound great&hellip;.rap, pop, classical, hard rock and heavy metal.Buy some, once you figure out which size is yours and get a set that fit on your headphones, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<h5 id="never-going-back-to-silicone">NEVER GOING BACK TO SILICONE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my Klipsch ear buds. But I had always had issues with the fit. None of the silicone tips were quite right. They didn&rsquo;t stay in place and I didn&rsquo;t consider them particularly comfortable.I finally got around to ordering new tips. I knew I wanted to try the memory foam type. In my search I found Comply brand. In the comparison chart in the description (thank you Amazon!), I saw the Comfort TS. It said that these were the style for extended wear. As I am most often using them on my cross-country flights, I decided to give them a try.HOLY C**P! Can I say &ldquo;Holy crap&rdquo;? If I thought my ear buds were good before, they are 100% better now! Not only more comfortable, but the fit is allowing me a sound quality that I didn&rsquo;t get with the silicone tips. They are also noise-cancelling meaning I can listen at a lower volume (safer) and still not be bother by environmental noise. Excellent. I am a believer and a customer for life.For reference, I own Klipsch Image S4A buds and the recommended tips are the Comply Comfort 100.</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-upgrade-over-stock">Worth the upgrade over stock!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>INITIAL IMPRESSION:I replaced the stock tips that came with my BestsX which after an hour or so caused my ear canal to ache. These tips fixed that problem and are VERY COMFORTABLE, you get three pair. They also fit perfectly on the BeatsX sound tube which I always fear when buying 3rd-party tips. There is a &ldquo;break in&rdquo; period as they are firm at first and take some time to mold to you ear canal, but they get softer and expand a bit after wearing them a few times. It took a me a couple of days before difference was noticeable when fresh.SOUND QUALITY:The BestsX earphone are not known to their bass so being super &ldquo;loud,&rdquo; but are considered a balanced earphone. Because these tips provide a better seal over the stock tips, the bass is improved slightly and overall sound quality has improved because it isolates noise much better. If you own earphones that put out more bass and are louder&ndash;I imagine you will also notice an increase in overall sound and comfort if you have the same issue as me.DAILY USE:I use my earphones at work with an open office so these tips tune out any noise even at low volume so I can&rsquo;t hear my office mates chatting. At the gym these tips do get slippery when working out so I have to adjust them from time to time. But these earphones and tips weren&rsquo;t designed for that so I&rsquo;m aware of this.FINAL THOUGHTS:I&rsquo;m very satisfied with these tips and I&rsquo;m still on my first pair and I think these&rsquo;ll last a while before changing them out for a fresh pair. Checkout my pictures to see the difference between a stock tip a new Comply tip vs &ldquo;broken in&rdquo; tip.</p>

<h5 id="comply-ts-100-comfort-tips-worked-for-me">Comply Ts-100 Comfort tips worked for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I carefully selected the right style and size of the tips based on other reviewers. I am using Klipsch R6i earphones. The provided silicon ear pieces from Klipsch fit reasonably well but do not secure the earphones in my ears. I have convex ear lobes, meaning no support for the ear pieces and they don&rsquo;t fit well enough to stay in my ear canal. Therefore, I usually wear them upside down over the top of my ear. For the R6i, this meant that that the audio/phone control on the left wire hangs agains my jaw - not very comfortable.I purchased the Ts-100 Comfort Foam earphone tips to see if I could get a better fit which would allow me to stop wearing the Klipsch earphones upside down. They do. The instructions are to roll the tips into a longer more tapered form before inserting, and holding them in place a few seconds so they expand back to their original shape (memory foam) making for a better fit. These are softer than the silicon tips from Klipsch and eventually more comfortable for long periods. My left ear canal is appreciably larger than my right, and these tips give a better fit to the left than right, but altogether comfortable, never falling out of either ear like the silicon tips did. Sound isolation is perfectly fine for all but the noisiest backgrounds and I haven&rsquo;t found sound quality diminished in any way over the Klipsch silicon tips.I was somewhat concerned about one reviewer who said these didn&rsquo;t last very long. I have been using them now for over six weeks with no apparent degradation. They inevitably get a little wax on them but have been using hydrogen peroxide on a swab to clean them. This does a good job without affecting the foam, except you have to give them a little time to completely dry. They continue to hold their shape. I do not use the earphones during sweaty exercise and my average use is only a couple of hours per day. But these are doing the job for me. Yes, they are a bit pricy but if they can last a couple of months before swapping out for new, they are worth it.</p>

<p>The 200 are the size you want for the SBH80. The next size down (150) are too small. The 200 fit snugly, I&rsquo;ve used them for months and they have yet to come off.</p>
