<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this Panda Compact Washer for almost three weeks now with both light and heavier loads with GREAT results. It is now <em>super</em> convenient to be able to do almost all of my laundry at home, plus with all costs considered the savings will be VERY significant versus using coin-op machines.The directions it comes with are sort of vague so I&rsquo;ve come up with a neat four step system to get a load done:1. Wash: Fill the Panda washer with water to a little over the halfway mark, making sure the drainage hose (on the right of the machine) is UP and <em>securely</em> connected to the side of the washer unit. To fill the washer easily, I added a diverter+hose attachment to my shower head to fill the washer (RapidBath Deluxe Dog Bathing System). Add soap and clothing, keeping in mind &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; here - once you&rsquo;ve set the timer and see how it is going, you can always add more water, soap, and/or clothing. To turn the unit on, turn the timer from 1-15 minutes depending on how long you want to pre-soak or wash the load.Presoaking helps; I tend to load it at night with what I&rsquo;ve used/worn for the day, set for 3-5 minutes, leave it soaking then continue the load in the morning. Everything comes out very clean, fresh smelling and uses very little detergent.2. Rinse: If your clothes were only lightly soiled and you want to re-use the soapy water just remove the clothes from the Panda and rinse in the tub - a large colander style basket and a hose helps here. If you will <em>not</em> be reusing the soapy water you can simply rinse the clothes by adding fresh water to the Panda washer while the hose is still in the tub for continuous drainage. This action is low tech/gravity driven - the hose must drain to a spot lower than its base.3. Wring - or Not: If you don&rsquo;t want to hand wring, let the clothes sit in either the washer (drained), or tub for 5-10 minutes or more.4. Dry: I use a Centrifugal Clothes Portable Spin Dryer to remove as much water as possible and then hang to dry.For me, each load can hold about 2 days worth of clothes, except in the case of jeans or heavy bath towels which I have been doing in very small loads which means those articles pretty much wash by themselves. After a run through the spin dryer I hang the clothes on a Minky X-Wing Indoor Drying Rack, 45-Feet Total Drying Space, White and everything is always is dry in just a few hours time.I have only had this washer for a couple of weeks but at this rate it will have paid for itself within 3-4 months. It seems pretty sturdy though and as you can see from how well the agitator moves it can do a really good job at cleaning the clothes as long as it is loaded properly. My only slight hesitation in recommending this unit is the unknown factor as far as how long it will last but I&rsquo;m happy having saved so many trips to the laundromat already and would definitely purchase again if for some reason it fails outside the six month warranty.For how well it functions, ease of use, and the price point I&rsquo;ll say I am VERY pleased with this purchase and easily give the Panda Compact Washer five stars.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, I have to preface this by saying I have purchased the Wonder Washer and was greatly disappointed. This thing is a 100x better than the Wonder Washer. I own both and could not believe I wasted my money on the other washer. My needs were simple - a small washer that could wash normal items like jeans, sheets, pillow cases, bath towels&hellip; you name it. This is the washer that can do it. If you are living in a small apartment or are on a budget and are tired of schlepping clothes to the laundry every week or the endless hunt for quarters - this is for you.The washer is the perfect size to sit on a counter top. I put mine on my kitchen counter next to the sink when I need to do the laundry. The washer is actually fairly lightweight and comes with an easy carry handle, so moving it is not difficult. It also has a top fill hole with a hose. I strongly recommend swapping the hose it comes with with a REAL hose. Go to your local aquarium supply or hardware store and purchase one. I think it takes a standard <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; hose. Any high quality flexible rubber hose or PVC hose should do. You will also want a faucet adapter or something to fit snug into your faucet. For me, the aquarium hose I had worked perfect and was able to wedge into my faucet spigot tight enough to allow easy filling. The drain works fine. You can see it hanging on the right of the stock photo of the unit. I didn&rsquo;t even realize the unit had a fill hose and drain until it arrived. I guess I missed it in the description, but it works great.The washer itself is just the right size. The motor is amazingly strong. You can easily throw a beach towel or something like a queen size duvet sheet in there and wash it. It pulls through like a champ. Jeans work great too. To give you an idea, the 5.5lb capacity is about a regular men&rsquo;s pair of jeans or a single queen size duvet sheet or about two queen size flat sheets or two regular bath towels. It is more about wet water weight than anything. So if it absorbs a lot of water and gets heavy quickly, it may slow down some. A large sheet can be done, but you will need to fill the tank to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> capacity with water before you add the sheet. Then push it under water so that it is covered. The key on larger items is to make sure there is enough water so that it always spins freely. So keep that in mind. Anything smaller like shirts, khakis or anything else will be a breeze.You will have to do multiple loads or get used to doing loads daily. But the convenience to me is worth it. My apartment was smaller and did not come with any hookups. The nearest laundry is about 3 miles away and closed early. I was always needing rolls of quarters and the local store was out or didn&rsquo;t have enough to spare. So things just never seemed to work out right for anything laundry related being convenient. This was the perfect solution.Also do yourself a favor and purchase the matching spin dryer. It is totally worth it. If you have to choose one, buy the dryer first. The dryer will not get your clothes 100% dry, but it eliminates a good 80-90% of the water to the point things are slightly damp. So a quick 10 minute air dry can usually dry your clothes after that (besides jeans that is).READ MORE</p>
