<h5 id="yeah-it-s-a-water-bottle-bag-but-i-m-still-pretty-impressed">Yeah, it&rsquo;s a water bottle bag but, I&rsquo;m still pretty impressed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:So, I wrote the review left below a few months ago and drove on with my life. I AM leaving the original review for reference though but, I do have to say that it has indeed changed drastically.See, given that the item in question was only $11, I didn&rsquo;t think much of it falling apart on me or my original review. I bought it, it broke, I moved on.Until I get an email from the manufacturer.According to the email, not only were they refunding my money after having seen my review BUT (and this is with no snark whatsoever the good part), they had made improvements on the design and wanted to send me one of the new models to see what I thought.Okay, 1) Wow. Just wow right there.I mean it too because, who in the heck really bothers with that kind of thing over an $11 bag? It&rsquo;s not like they weren&rsquo;t still at 4 stars and, as mentioned in the original review below, I really didn&rsquo;t bother to try to get a refund.So, I said: Okay because, frankly, that kind of conscientiousness deserves at least a few minutes to see what they did.Sure enough, a few emails back and forth and the refund came through with lightening speed and they emailed me to make sure. I mean they were all over this thing. Again, $11 bag but they were on top of it like it was some custom designer piece.Of course, by this point I was actually getting a little nervous on their behalf but, there was no way that I could find fault with their attention to detail. Regardless of all of this however, I was actually even more resolute in my decision to give an honest and thorough critic on the new design because, imho, that kind of thing requires nothing less than full honesty. Anything less would be an insult to the person asking the question.So the bag came in and I pulled out the magnification glasses that I use for sewing and took a look.Thankfully, for everyone involved, it is indeed better.The problem with the strap seam that I mentioned in my original review has indeed been fixed. The part where it is sewn to the sleeve itself has now been fully doubled over and even feels like from the corners that I can touch that some form of unraveling adhesive has been applied.Heck, the double over is even off center towards the bottom so that the weight of the bottle will distribute across the seam better and, on top of that, it appears that they actually french rolled the seams where the straps are sewn to each other (they&rsquo;ve been folded twice to prevent unraveling and iirc it was originally just folded once).Also, while I can&rsquo;t remember whether or not the strap was sewn to the sleeve with an X inside the box seam pattern originally, it has been now in order to further stabilize it.So, I am tickled pink because, this is just a level of detail that&hellip;. wow. And, all of this fuss over an $11 bottle bag.So, they were curious to know what I think and this is what I think:I see absolutely NO reason why this bag shouldn&rsquo;t hold for a very long time to come and I am beyond impressed with the conscientiousness and attention to detail of the manufacturer.I mean, yes, it was smart of them to track down a critic with specific complaints to see if they had been addressed properly in the new design. BUT I have also seen a good number of high priced luxury items where the manufacturer would never have bothered to even change that design much less get it checked out by someone who didn&rsquo;t like the original one. Particularly when there were still a bunch of glowing reviews still up.So, yes, it&rsquo;s a water bottle bag. It&rsquo;s an $11 water bottle bag at that. But, I am impressed. You did good guys. Thank you. You definitely definitely went above and beyond imho and, the new design is great.ORIGINAL REVIEW (only left for reference- see UPDATE above)So, I order this thing. It comes in and seems to look fine. Next morning, I fill up my water bottle, put it into the sling and put the sling over my shoulder. On the way to the car, the strap gives out.Obviously not too thrilled about this because it&rsquo;s juuuust cheap enough to make it not worth my time and money to send back, I inspect the thing to see if it was just a case of a bad unit or if it really was just badly made. Come to find out that the straps, which are made of a material that&rsquo;s prone to unraveling are sewn with NO seam allowance. This means that the fabric will indeed do just what it had done for me- unravel past the seam causing the strap to fall off. Since the other side is doing the same thing the verdict was clear:Badly made.Shame too because if they had just sewn the ends of those straps a little further up the whole thing would have been fine but both sides were identical so there&rsquo;s just no way that this could have been a case of just one bad seam slipping past quality control. Nope. This is a $10 lesson in why that fraction of an inch is so important when it comes to sewing anything.Which makes zero sense as to why this decision was approved all the way through production really because it&rsquo;s not even saving the company any money due to the fact that there was plenty of room to put those seams further up and therefore make it sturdy but, oh well. Live and learn.Since it IS too cheap to return, at this point, I&rsquo;d recommend for anyone who has already gotten one of these to do themselves a favor and toss in a quick stop seam just below the metal rings on either side before using it and just get something else next time.(For that second seam, since you can&rsquo;t get this thing through a machine without a struggle due to the placement and probably have to do it by hand, I&rsquo;d recommend something sturdy like button hole thread, embroidery floss or fishing line. Just go straight through everything from the outside of the strap to the interior of the casing. Yes, it will wear out eventually as the bottle rubs against it on the inside of the case itself but at least it&rsquo;ll hopefully keep the thing going long enough to get your money&rsquo;s worth and/or find a better replacement.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this! I got this for my 9 year old son because he wanted a bigger water bottle, but that meant his bottle didn’t fit in his lunch box. He dropped his last expensive bottle and the cap broke which made it useless. I bought this to go with his new thermos water bottle. It’s stretchy so it’s easy to use and the straps are adjustable. It’s also easy to just toss in the washing machine when it gets dirty. So happy with this purchase.</p>
