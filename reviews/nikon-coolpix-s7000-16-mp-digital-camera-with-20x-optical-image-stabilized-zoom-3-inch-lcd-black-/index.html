Zoom in close with Dynamic Fine Zoom
Every COOLPIX is designed around a genuine NIKKOR glass lens, the legendary optics that have helped make Nikon famous. The COOLPIX S7000&rsquo;s 20x optical zoom lens goes from wide-angle, great for portraits and landscapes, all the way up to telephoto, great for closeups of sports, concerts, nature and more.

<p>Create cinematic movies
Full HD 1080/60i videos with stereo sound
With the press of a button, the COOLPIX S7000 becomes a high-performance video camera. 4-axis Hybrid Vibration Reduction (VR) helps you shoot stable, smooth videos without a tripod, and a built-in stereo mic captures high-fidelity sound.

<h5 id="nikon-s7000-performed-better-than-expected">Nikon S7000 Performed Better than Expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Reading product reviews by customers is funny. Why do some people have difficulties while others love a product? Either poor product quality control or user error&hellip;we will never no. I took a chance and purchased the S7000 and so far love it. I tested the camera in auto mode taking long zoom and macro shots in different light levels and was please with all pictures. The stability at long zoom was fantastic. The camera is small and fast using a ultra sdhc card 8 GB 40mb/s. So far I love it. Good luck, download the full manual and read it.</p>

<h5 id="it-takes-very-good-pictures-and-video-with-high-quality-audio-and-excellent">It takes very good pictures and video with high quality audio and excellent &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera to replace my Nikon S8000 which I guess sounds strange but that has more to do with the way Nikon names their cameras than anything else. The appealing features of the S7000 for me are it&rsquo;s compact size, light weight, 20x optical zoom, time lapse capabilities and the fact that they dispensed with the pop-up flash which I always thought was kind of silly since it seemed that my finger was always in the way when it wanted to pop up and you had to keep pushing it back down.I&rsquo;ve had the camera for about three weeks during which time I was travelling and used it extensively. It takes very good pictures and video with high quality audio and excellent image stabilization. These types of cameras are aptly called &ldquo;point and shoot&rdquo; you&rsquo;re not necessarily going to take much time composing the shot, I often don&rsquo;t even look at the screen. This camera is extremely fast on the draw for such use and can be comfortably carried in your pocket so you can easily catch shots that otherwise would have been missed completely.The time lapse feature has a number of modes spanning from 10 to 150 minutes and works well.There are a couple of issues however, I wouldn&rsquo;t call them deal breakers but I can&rsquo;t figure out how they ended up in a final production product. The first is the mode dial. It&rsquo;s a nice feature, better than the S8000 where you have to go into the menu to change modes but the detents are way too soft so if you are using the camera for a quick point and shoot there&rsquo;s a good chance the mode dial isn&rsquo;t going to be where you left it or wanted it to be so you need to check it often. The second thing is that the flash is on the same side as the shutter button so, depending on how you hold the camera, there&rsquo;s a good chance your finger is going to be over it when you snap your shot.Overall though I like the camera. It feels much lighter than the S8000 and that might be interpreted as &ldquo;cheaper&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s actually an asset when carrying it in a shirt pocket. Both models of course are made in China but honestly if you are going to try and maintain a personal boycott of products made in China good luck, you&rsquo;re going to seriously constrict your options. For what this camera is designed for it does well and I have many excellent photos that would not exist simply because I would not have been lugging an enormous digital SLR around with me at the time.</p>

<h5 id="mom-of-4-boys-i-love-this-camera">Mom of 4 boys- I love this camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m just writing this review because of all the mixed reviews on this camera. I searched reviews for a WEEK on cameras- I&rsquo;m very picky when it comes to an expensive electronic purchase. Well I bought a SonyW830 and returned it the same day- all the reviews made it seem like it was better than this camera so I tried it out &amp; it had a good &ldquo;shot&rdquo; every 1 in 10 I took- literally. I have 4 boys so I needed something a little more reliable than that &amp; something that&rsquo;s going to catch action shots so I am glad I returned it and decided to get this one! I bought the camera yesterday &amp; took a few shots at home of my boys jumping around and obviously some came out blurry (it&rsquo;s a point &amp; shoot not a DSLR) but majority of them got the shot with little to no blur. My real test was at the beach today! It does have a little problem with focusing on the right object but you just press the camera shot button down half way and it refocuses and usually gets what you wanted, then press the button all the way down and bam, perfect picture! (It&rsquo;s a quicker process than what it seems). The zooms&rsquo; photos are also amazing! I&rsquo;m really impressed with this camera and glad I spent the little extra money on it. I do feel like 200$ is a bit much, maybe around 160$ Would&rsquo;ve been better but then again maybe that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m cheap :-P - I never do reviews but just wanted to post one just in case someone else was stuck in between reviews on cameras like I was! :)</p>

<h5 id="loved-it-for-traveling">Loved it for traveling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera refurbished back in March for two overseas trips and I love it! For being a point and shoot and for the price you cant beat it! My boyfriend liked it so much he ended up buying the exact same one as well. Uploading the pictures is very easy even via the wifi. It was great being able to upload the pictures to my phone instantly since I did not have a computer with me during my trips. You can even apply filters to the pictures on the camera I believe. When I traveled I took A LOT of pictures during about 10 hour days so I would usually need a spare battery before the day was over. But for normal every day use, my battery has lasted for over 3 months now. I would definitely recommend this.</p>

<h5 id="i-was-happy-with-the-picture-quality-and-the-different-modes">I was happy with the picture quality and the different modes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item to be used on trips and outings where we did not want to bring our large professional camera. I was happy with the picture quality and the different modes, considering it was a box camera. However, after only 4 months of use the camera started to malfunction and the image is constantly shaking. The camera was not damaged in any way, we put it away any time we aren&rsquo;t using it and as a photographer I have 4-5 professional cameras at the house most of the time and none of them have this issue. I thought the &ldquo;refurbished&rdquo; was true but apparently it was not. This camera was probably used 5-6 times before this malfunction occurred and has essentially made the camera useless. The warranty/return period is not long enough to evaluate the camera before it malfunctioned.</p>
