<p>Wilson Electronics — DB Pro — Cellular Signal Booster</p>

<p>View Larger
Improve the clarity of cell phone calls and reduce the number of dropped calls in your home or personal office with the Wilson Electronics DB Pro cellular signal booster. The product includes everything you need to capture a weak cellular signal, transmit it into your home or office, increase the cell signal strength, and improve the performance of your cell phone, regardless of which carrier you use. The result is improved reception, fewer dropped calls, and increased data transmission rates.</p>

<p>View Larger
How It Works
Many homes and buildings include materials that reduce or block cellular signals. Sometimes, the physical location prevents a strong signal from reaching your home or office because of the location of cell towers, other structures, or environmental barriers such as hills or trees. The DB Pro captures a weak cellular signal, transmits it into your home or office, and boosts the signal strength to and from your cell phone, resulting in better call quality, fewer dropped calls, and increased data transmission rates.</p>

<p>The DB Pro uses three primary components – an outside antenna, the signal booster, and an inside antenna. The outside antenna, which is mounted outside of your building on a wall or the roof, captures the weak cellular signal from the nearest tower. It then transmits the signal to the signal booster, which increases the signal strength before transmitting it to the inside antenna. Your cell phone then picks up the improved signal from the inside antenna and transmits back to the inside antenna, through the signal booster and to the outside antenna, sending a stronger cellular signal back to the cell tower.</p>

<p>Who It Helps
The Wilson Electronics DB Pro is especially helpful for people who rely on their cell phones for their business needs, whether running a home business or from an office. These individuals require a stronger cellular signal to stay in contact with customers, vendors, remote employees, and others and to improve data transmission rates and reliability. The DB Pro increases signal strength in small to mid-size home and personal office spaces. The DB Pro boosts the signal for all voice calls, as well as increasing signal strength on 3G networks across all major cellular carriers.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s Included
The Wilson DB Pro comes with everything you need to start benefiting from improved cellular reception, including:</p>

<p>An outside antenna that mounts on the roof or an outside wall. This antenna captures the signal from a nearby cellular tower.
Mounting hardware to install your antenna in the way that works best for you.
60 feet of coax cable (two 30-foot coils) to run from the outside antenna to the DB Pro signal booster, conveying the signal from the cell tower.
The DB Pro signal booster, which connects to the outside and inside antennas and increases the strength of inbound and outbound cellular signals.
An inside antenna, which mounts to a wall or ceiling and connects to the DB Pro booster to transmit the stronger cellular signal to your cell phone.
AC power supply
Simple installation instructions and contact information for additional support.
Features
DIY - Multiple installation options to meet your needs

<h5 id="better-than-i-anticipated-what-a-wonderful-purchase">Better than I anticipated. What a wonderful purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been researching and delaying this purchase for a couple years now, not knowing if it would help our cell reception in our house. And the price of it. A lot of money for something that may not help! Anyway, we have terrible reception, one to MAYBE two bars of 1X service in our home or no bars at all. -105dBm or worse in the test mode. (If you want to learn more about dBm and cell phone test mode, go to [&hellip;]. Did much of my research on their site) Even on the roof of the house the reception was poor, so I didn&rsquo;t know if this booster would do any good. You couldn&rsquo;t carry a phone conversation in the house without the call dropping or you sprinting out of the house hoping the call wouldn&rsquo;t fail. Usually failed anyway. We have no land line and use Verizon&rsquo;s internet service with a MIFI modem device. So, poor cell reception, poor internet service! Our land line carrier doesn&rsquo;t offer DSL in our area and who knows when they might. Our Verizon MIFI device has been up for renewal for several months, but I didn&rsquo;t want to lock this in for two more years if DSL was coming to the area soon.Long story short I said screw it and ordered the Wilson Electronics 841263 kit. I know the company name and actually own a couple of their other vehicle antennas. I attached the outside directional antenna to the side of the house with a nine foot piece of 1 and half inch pipe, so it was above the roof line 5 to 6 foot. Ran the wire (which is nothing more than tv antenna coax cable RG6) to the basement, mounted the booster in the basement and ran the wire from the booster to the room above and set the internal antenna on a shelf roughly 6 foot off the floor.What a surprise, turned it on, powered up all the cell phones and modem, had 5 bars in most of the house! Not just 5 bars, but 5 bars of 3G! The best reception has been -68dBm and consistently in the -75dBm to -85dBm range, (-50dBm is the best, above -100dBm is basically no service). We now have excellent service in the house. Even the internet works great now. Not DSL fast, but running in the .5 meg speed which is more than double before, when it worked. It has been up for a month or so now and have noticed weather effecting it, dropping reception to the 3 to 4 bars on dreary, overcast days, but still pretty good reception.If your cell service is poor, but have some service, this is a great device. I highly recommend it. Keep in mind that it only supports 3G. You need a different booster for 4G. Verizon 3G works in the 800MHz range and their 4G works in the 700MHz. Hope this helps in your decision making.</p>

<p>My mobile carrier is Verizon (can you hear me now) who boasts of the largest network. Of course I live in a pretty dead zone for just about every carrier. I sometimes had 1 bar but not enough to make a call or send a text without being plastered against one particular window. The network extender from Verizon didn&rsquo;t work with my internet provider so I had to find another solution. At first we had the antenna in the attic with the wire run to the downstairs (temporary because it was freezing outside and unable to mount outside) but the unit would go into protect mode (orange) meaning oscillation. The first warm day we installed the antenna outside on the garage roof and ran the wire through the basement to the first floor. We actually now can make a call from any room in the house. Before I even purchased this I called Wilson who explained that oscillation will be worst with the omni directional antenna which you would need at least 50 feet of distance in a straight line away from the antenna and the inside antenna. With the Yagi you only have to be away 20 feet between both antennas. I am glad I got the Yagi because in a 3 story house (counting the basement) with the Yagi in the attic and 8 foot ceilings I had to have the indoor antenna on the floor in the basement in order to prevent oscillation. My advice would be to get the Yagi antenna if you don&rsquo;t want the hassle of repositioning distance between the two antennas and remember that the 50 or 20 feet of distance between is a straight line measurement. You can run 50 feet of wire up and over, down and under, but it&rsquo;s not how much wire you use it&rsquo;s a straight line distance between the two which is just easier with a Yagi. If I had bought the omni directional antenna I know it would have been much harder to get 50 feet of distance. As far as Wilson goes, the rep was very helpful with all my questions and after I received the product I didn&rsquo;t have to call back just re-routing. Wilson is top of the line as far as anything antenna is involved.</p>

<p>I purchased this item as a gift for my parents. They live in Southeastern Montana. They have AT&amp;T as a carrier and get very limited to no cell reception in their house. People with Verizon report the same problems. They also use a wireless hotspot for internet. Before installing the booster, they could use their laptop at one chair at the kitchen table and pretty much could not make a call with their cell phone. After installing the booster, you can surf the internet anywhere in the house and can walk anywhere in the house while talking on the cell phone. They have a 14x70 modular and the transmitter was installed about the middle of the house. Installation is very easy. We did not mount the antenna to a pole as recommended. We mounted to the eve of the house. After hooking it up, we got an error code that said we had too strong of a signal. Ironic I know! We turned the antenna 180 degrees and everything worked fine. Before, when I visited my parents, I would just shut my phone off because the battery would go dead searching for a signal. Now I can send and receive texts, make phone calls, and surf the web without any problems. This one is rated larger than what is needed for their home, but I wanted them to be able to sit on the deck and make phone calls, which they can. I am now considering another one for their camper. Many of the places they camp have very limited cell reception. I will post on that unit if I purchase it. Based on my experience, I can&rsquo;t recommend this unit enough. I do have to emphasize, there must be a signal to pick up. It will not work if there is no signal to boost. If you have a signal, but are constantly dropping calls or getting kicked off the internet, I would definitely give this a try.</p>
