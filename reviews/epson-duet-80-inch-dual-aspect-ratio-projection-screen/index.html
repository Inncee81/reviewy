<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="just-what-i-was-looking-for">Just what I was looking for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The form factor to this product is fantastic. There are a few issues that I can comment on below&hellip;1) My problem is that I travel and I want to take this with me. My solution was to use a hard shell golf bag with wheels. You can check the bag into most airlines without a problem. The Duet Dimensions are 46.2 x 12.2 x 9.3 inches. A typical card shell golf bag has a total height of 51 inches, total interior height 47.5 inches, total interior width 11 inches, and total interior depth at 12.5 inches. This easily fits the Duet requirements. I usually wrap the Duet in a towel to prevent a lot of movement in the case. You can buy a used hard shell case for $40 is you look around.2) When I first stretched out the Duet, I noticed a wrinkle down the center of the screen (see the photo). I was a little concerned about it. I decided to leave the screen open for a while to see what would happen. The wrinkle dissipated enough within a day to be OK.3) The issue with the height of the screen has been mentioned before. It would be handy if the height was several inches taller, but that would extend the overall folded dimensions of the product (and no longer fit in my golf bag). Fortunately, the top of the tripod has a plastic guide that easily comes off. For the times I need the screen to be a little taller, I take the guide off and insert another pole down the shaft of the tripod. It took some looking to find a suitable size. I will post a photo the next time I have this set up.Overall, it is a great product and meets my needs at a great price&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="heavy-holds-impressions-and-curls-on-both-top-and-bottom">Heavy, holds impressions and curls on both top and bottom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept is different than the traditional typical screen in that it opens horizontal vs. vertical.What I like:Stand is sturdy, easily store stand in the screen case.Screen is protected in a decent case, although plastic case, we&rsquo;ll see how durable it is over time.Has the option to mount to a wall.What I don&rsquo;t like:Bulky and heavy compared to other screens due to the dual enclosures (right and left) that come together.As other reviewers have mentioned, top and bottom edges curl, although it curls only on the black edge, not affecting the screen itself.The one I received has indentation marks where the screen comes together like it&rsquo;s been stored in this closed position for a while. I&rsquo;ve seen this screen elsewhere and it did not have this issue or the curling, so not sure if this is due to being stored for quite some time or if it&rsquo;s due to something else. I&rsquo;ll try to post a picture of these issues.Height is very short as others have said, so if you are showing this to a crowded room, you may be challenged to get it to a height everyone can view. Wish they offered an extension tube or a height adjusted base.</p>

<h5 id="more-like-a-giant-widescreen-tv-than-a-huge-movie-experience">More like a giant widescreen tv than a huge movie experience.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Heavy but well constructed. Not really for traveling but nice to be able to store it away. The gold lines in the middle of the screen are visible in white light but for most movies not visible. One think I didn&rsquo;t count on - while the screen is plenty wide it&rsquo;s not particularly long due to its design. This meant we had to shrink the picture to fit the screen. The end result is rather than a huge a movie screen it&rsquo;s more like a big widescreen tv. Works very well for s small living room. If you are looking for a huge movie experience you&rsquo;ll probably be disappointed. Works well for us though.</p>

<h5 id="not-without-its-flaws-but-a-good-quality-portable-projection-screen">Not without its flaws but a good quality, portable projection screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen comes with instructions, a tripod, wall mount plate, and mounting hardware.I was looking for a projection screen that is good quality yet portable for use in various areas around my home. After having issues with ordering a different brand, I decided to go with known brand and after finding a good deal on the Epson Duet, I purchased this one. Although I primarily will use this as a home projection screen, this is a good screen for work related stuff as well.Although I don’t think this screen is perfect as it does have a couple small flaws, I do think for the price and for a portable screen this is a good quality, uniquely designed screen.I really like the fact that it is compact and collapses into its own carry case that is about 43 inches long and less than 8 inches wide, making it easy to handle and move around. The screen with the tripod is around 25 to 30 pounds. Although I would not call it light, with the handles, it is fairly easy to maneuver and carry around from place to place. It can be wall mounted as well with the bracket but I prefer the ability to move it around.The screen really only takes a minute or two to put together or take apart with just a few steps to assemble. The screen can be fitted in either direction, depending on whether you want the screen low or high, although it looks better fitted at its maximum height off the ground of 33 inches.The screen is a low gain white one but it is bright and does a really good job at projecting a picture on the screen, especially in the dark. It is also decent with backlight as well. The design is different than most screens as you open the screen from side to side rather than pulling the screen down or up onto a hanging bracket. The screen has the ability to expand to a 65 inch 4:3 screen (at the first click), and an 80 inch 16:9 screen on the second click. The screen is large (especially when expanded fully) and does a nice job for projecting the TV, movies, or my laptop onto the screen for work related stuff.The stand itself is a basic metal that is pretty light weight considering the size of the screen but it is very sturdy and holds the screen well and is very stable when fully extended. The screen itself has a bit of movement in it if you bump into it but otherwise holds steady. This can be used outdoors, however, it is not good for any particularly windy day.As I indicated previously, this screen is not without its flaws. The top and lower portion of the screen curl a little bit with the top portion having a slight sag due to there being no support at the very top of the screen. It isn’t a bit annoyance though as the screen has enough real estate that you don’t project onto those areas. There is also a slight line in the center of the screen where it collapses together. It is noticeable when nothing is being projected onto the screen but disappears when a projector is shining onto it. These two things are small annoyances but not a major thing in my book. The top sag could be fixed with a little Velcro if it is annoying enough to you but to me isn’t really necessary.Pro’sCompact and portable, easy to carry aroundGood qualityStable tripodEasy to assemble and disassembleGood projection screen pictureEasy to storeCon’sIs 25 to 30 poundsCurling at top and bottom edges of screenSagging at top of screenA slight line in centerNot great for windy daysMay sit a bit too low for some (Max 33-inch height from floor)Overall this is a good quality screen that works well for me for occasional home use and work related stuff. Not without its flaws, but decent overall.4 stars</p>
