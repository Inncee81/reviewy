<p>Prostar Clevo N850HK1 basic modelHaving this laptop for over 3 weeks, I will try to highlight the relevant aspects of it. I won’t state the specs this product says it has, because it does have them.Chasis:Coming from an entry level laptop, this item is amazing. My 2014 lenovo g505s was cheap built, got a lot of flex in the keyboard section and the display. The N850HK1 got little to none flex in the keyboard section. It is very sturdy and even though it has a plastic chasis, it doesn’t feel cheap at all. The display does flex, but it doesn’t feel like it will break at all. The hinges are well built, they won’t open the display with one hand though.It has plenty of ports, I even connected it to 2 external monitors, one with HDMI and another with one mini display port (this laptop has 2). No VGA though. There is one thing I don’t like about the ports placement, there are 2 usb ports on the right side of the laptop (one 3.0 and the other 2.0, both type A) along with the audio output jack and mic input jack. If you like to connect a lot of devices to your laptop, the cables might get in the way of the mouse, if you are right-handed as me, but with only the mouse connected to the left side usb, you won’t be having any trouble.I’m aware that the usb type C on this laptop has no thunderbolt, but that is not a deal breaker for me.The exhaust of the GPU fan is on the right side of the laptop, which is a bad placement for right-handed using the mouse near it. It does get hot when under stress.Keyboard:The backlight color of the keyboard has pretty neat transitions between the 3 possible zones and the color palette to choose the RGB colors is wide enough too.Regarding the keys, they are soft touch, feels spongy but great quality. The spacing between them is perfect for me to not mistype. That’s a big improve over my last laptop.Even though it feels quite comfortable to type in it, there is no physical indicator of Num lock, Caps lock nor Scroll lock; no led whatsoever. When pressed either of these keys, it will display a notification on the left top corner of the display showing the actual state of the lock.The keys do have a little clicky noise when typing and a kind of sound like a spring pulling the key back to its original state when a key is depressed.Mouse Trackpad:Even though I don’t use it so much, the trackpad has useful features like a fingerprint scanner and multi touch gestures. Left and right clicks are mechanical, not integrated in the trackpad zone, which is not bad. The trackpad is accurate enough to use the laptop without a mouse for browsing and exploring content. I won’t recommend this for gaming, but who does that?Display:The basic model of this laptop comes with a matte display, bright enough to work outdoors too. At 100% level brightness indoors it is quite uncomfortable to work on, so I have it in 3 levels of screen brightness (30%).I haven’t run any type of screen test, but so far, every game I’ve played is color vivid, with blacks as blacks, not as grey shaded blacks.Battery:I tested the battery life with a video playback, 10 chrome tabs opened and audio from headphones. I got 3 hours and 50 minutes from 95% to 10% battery charge, having backlit keyboard at level 1, 2 levels of screen brightness (20%) and power saver mode. It is not much, but it sure will be handy in a hurry.The battery is removeable, but one of the laptop rubber supports is placed in the battery, so you will have to put something in the battery chamber to keep the laptop balanced. I placed an old little box to fit in it, that measures 9 cm x 4.5 cm x 1.81 cm (3.58 in x 1.8 in x 0.71 in).Overall, the N850HK1 performs well enough to be considered one of the best laptops under $1000, alongside other products in this category. I like the powerful i7 and the GTX 1050 Ti packed for less than the competition. Running demanding games like Doom, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands pre-sequel, Assassin’s Creed Unity, Mirrors Edge Catalyst is pretty smooth.Little details should have been taken care of, like the exhaust and ports on the right side and the lack of leds to feedback the locks’ states, but after all, when gaming or working, these aspects will go unnoticed.First time buying a laptop from Prostar, I’m sure it won’t be the last time. I’m very pleased with this laptop and the company itself.</p>

<p>LONG REVIEW but very INFORMATIVE.Let me just start by saying this is a solid computer. It works, its certainly faster than the HP Pavillion dv6-1362nr from 2009(which finally died before purchasing this).As a gamer it performs nicely as for the games I play are PUBG and Rocket League primarily.I use demanding programs on this as well. MATLab and Solidworks, multi-sim and many many more. No real issues but I sensed something was off with this thing right away given its appealing specs. I will give a solution to this at the bottom of the review.FPS for these games:Rocket League ~50-60 average under any gfx load. Worse performance on higher settings.PUBG mostly low with a couple ultra settings and i get ~40-55 average. Worse fluidity on all ultra. (not uncommon on a seemingly half-budget gaming laptop). Note this game is also in beta but the issues i have are not with the game itself, but the hardware i have running the game. Load times for each game are tolerableThese marks may seem alright but I noticed a lag spike or load stutter of some sort every 5-6 seconds consistently across playing either of these games or any other game, high demanding or low demanding. I tried all my tweaking knowledge to fix it thru nvidia programs, msi afterburner to see if Overclocking would help( it didn&rsquo;t help the issue), all throughout disabling programs in Task Mngr and even registry entries if needed. No luck on solving my ANNOYING lag spike.(Solution to this at the bottom, though costly)PROS:Absolutely not necessary but just to make not of the capability of the CPU, it can run both Rocket League and PUBG at the same time with no performance decrease against the other, even from the GPU. The Kaby Lake 7700HQ certainly does its job no problem. Will automatically turbo boost from 2.8Ghz to 3.8Ghz, but it tends to run turbo boost a lot even on low usage. Use the laptop power management settings to lower your cpu. Right click battery in tray &gt;&gt; power options &gt;&gt; process power management is where you will tweak this if need be.-The 1050Ti doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. Games default gfx settings on nearly max every time.(Anti-Alias, texture, shadows etc.)-IPS screen is worth it. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt my eyes like a normal Full HD tn panel(worth researching out tn panel vs IPS)CONS:- Unfortunately the SSD, HDD, and RAM are all issues of this computer which I will elaborate more on their bottle-necking.- SSD is 128gb nVMe for certain, but its write speeds are terrible. Pretty awful. 20-30 second boot time. Comparing to a Samsung 960 EVO, the stock 128gb has <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> the average read/write speed.- HDD is SATA 2 not SATA 3. May not be important to some but it does make a difference in data transfer. Don&rsquo;t put games on the HDD if you do plan on gaming. Its own write speed is a simple bottleneck and will decrease load time for the game and wont help loading textures for the first time each instance of the game.-Now the RAM. 8gb is alright in today&rsquo;s standards but its only 1 stick. Any enthusiast would be using 2 sticks of RAM to utilize dual-channel. Also it says 2400mhz but running CPU-Z i could only ever find 1200mhz even under load. The nature of the RAM may be doing something else i&rsquo;m not seeing but i certainly cant find 2400mhz anywhere in relation. This was very concerning though CPU-Z may not be showing me something that supports its 2400mhz capability. However, its not the best for gaming. General applications run well with this stock RAM.- The backlit keyboard is cool but the Hotkey software is crap. It&rsquo;s notifications pop-up during gaming sessions incessantly at the same time my game would lag every few moments and you cant turn off the notifications. The software menu is minimal and lacking on certain customizations.- 2.0 FHD webcam. very basic and nothing to write home about other than that its OK(usual grainy and poor quality). About as good as any laptop cam from about 10 years ago. Compares to the cam on the laptop i upgraded from.Tips:-Buy the computer for the CPU, GPU, and IPS panel. If you custom build this put in your own SSD, HDD(if necessary) and RAM. Forego having pro-star put it in(not worth the extra money for them to do it). The price points for the upgraded models are about $100 more than what its sold for individually on amazon. I&rsquo;m referring to the samsung 960 EVO. Pro-star offers the upgrade to the 960 EVO for $320, i bought the same one here on Amazon for ~$220.-Upgrading to 16gb ram through prostar is another $80. Keep in mind that this isn&rsquo;t brand name stuff like Kingston or Corsair. Hyundai Electronics is the manufacturer that holds a sub name of Gold Key placed on the ram sticker. Unknown to me beforehand but will be known as a maker of inferior RAM for sticks for gaming.-Research, buy upgrades separately and install it yourself. Its easier than making a cake, honestly. 15 screws and pop off the bottom layer of the chassis and boom you have instant access to the SSD, HDD, and RAM.I replaced this stock 8GB ram with Corsair Vengeance 2x8gb sticks at ~$155.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Memory-16GB-2400MHz-SODIMM/dp/B019MRBKYG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504106524&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=corsair+vengeance+sodimm+ddr4I">https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Memory-16GB-2400MHz-SODIMM/dp/B019MRBKYG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504106524&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=corsair+vengeance+sodimm+ddr4I</a> also replaced the stock SSD for the Samsung EVO 960 at ~$220<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-960-EVO-Internal-MZ-V6E500BW/dp/B01M20VBU7/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504106587&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=samsung+evo+960+500BENEFITS">https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-960-EVO-Internal-MZ-V6E500BW/dp/B01M20VBU7/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504106587&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=samsung+evo+960+500BENEFITS</a> of the two above buys:- Installation took me 10 minutes for both of these, just get a small screwdriver thats all you need and its super easy.- Boot time for windows decreased to 10 seconds from 30 seconds. WOW. Also the write speed is amazing. Photoshop usually takes a long while install, but this was MINUTES by comparison to my previous installation experiences. Just for further reference, Installing fresh Win10 Home on this EVO 960 SSD was jaw dropping. It took about 5 minutes or less to start the installation to the point where you meet Cortana for the first time in the setup. The stock SSD took up to 3 Hours to install windows on this stock setup. AWFUL.- FPS/performance/stability increased by DOUBLE or more in PUBG and can now handle Ultra gfx without ANY noticeable video lag. It runs flawless now and doesn&rsquo;t have a spike or lag time every 5-6 seconds.- MATLAb took less than 10 seconds to boot as opposed to a minute or less on the stock setup. Time is precious.- Game load times are significantly FASTER and feel better.End thoughts:- Good computer but you will notice problems if you pay attention. Picky hardware enthusiasts would easily find reason to hate this computer aside from CPU/GPU/Monitor. I dont hate it, but i don&rsquo;t like inferior parts bottle-necking my superior components and the upgrades do it justice by comparison.- Decent price but i would spend the extra money away from pro-star hands on the upgrades to save money and gain real satisfaction for the money you put in. Or simply buy something else more satisfactory to escape hassle.About $1300-1400 I spent total with the upgrades but it makes the computer feel like a real Tower PC that an enthusiast would build him/herself. The upgrades are entirely worth it for the performance gain.If i put in the equivalent offers from prostar it would be upwards $1600 and perhaps low $1300&rsquo;s or high $1200&rsquo;s if i knew to not have the inferior parts not installed. Just because it&rsquo;s titled 8gb 2400mhz or uses the M.2 ssd form factor with nVMe doesn&rsquo;t in the least bit mean its a GOOD or GREAT buy. A LOT to learn from in this purchase and hopefully this helps the next person be better informed about some aspects of this laptop.Sorry no photos or screenshots for comparisons as I was really excited and impatient to put in the new hardware and see the difference. WORTH the noted upgrades, once again.</p>

<p>A great laptop overall. It loads quickly since the OS is loaded in the SSD. The only downside is that the 1TB Hard Drive can seem a bit small, though one could replace it after purchase if needed. It runs relatively quiet, and doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any overheating issues. The only downside is the fact that you can&rsquo;t outright buy it with a high capacity Hard Drive.</p>
