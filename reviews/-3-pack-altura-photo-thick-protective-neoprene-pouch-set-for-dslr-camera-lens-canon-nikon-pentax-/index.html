<h5 id="the-best-ones-i-ve-found">The Best Ones I&rsquo;ve Found</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the best of the Neoprene pouches I&rsquo;ve tried so far - many of them highly rated.These get used exclusively for photo gear. I store everything from lenses to ball heads to rails to panning and leveling bases, clamps etc.I know my photo gear has got a good home - and a safe one. While I&rsquo;d have to say many have the same drawstring and clip at the top, there are a couple of differences. What sets these apart at first glance is the deep purple fabric lip, double stitched on a nice, beefy neoprene body. What I really like about these however is all of the ones I&rsquo;ve gotten elsewhere have a fabric interior, these have a plush liner. It&rsquo;s extra soft, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if glass were to make contact with it. If for some reason a containment got inside of it, this would act as an extra barrier as it most likely wouldn&rsquo;t sit on the surface as it would on plain fabric. Also, the soft liner doesn&rsquo;t shed, which could have been a potential problem. It&rsquo;s an excellent micro-material and feels just fantastic. I&rsquo;d like a blanket made out of this stuff!BTW, I see a complaint about this interior shedding. I can tell you mine absolutely does not do this. From lenses to ball heads and clamps - all black and varying materials, there&rsquo;s no fibers of any sort. Typically, this sort of microfiber doesn&rsquo;t shed - and even when pulling on it I cannot get any to come off try as I might.Now, don&rsquo;t get the impression that the extra large one is going to fit your 70-<sup>200</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.8 IS lens with hood or collar. This should be pretty obvious from the sample photos. a 70-<sup>200</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> would probably fit with a hood, but not with IS. It would also fit a Tamron 70-<sup>300</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-5.6 VC with the hood on for use. I use it for my leveling bases and rotating clamps. I use the extra large one for a fairly large macro focusing rail. The large model fits my Tamron 70-<sup>300</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-5.6 VC perfectly, with hood reversed. The medium size is perfect for a ball head from a mid 40&rsquo;s up to mid 50&rsquo;s. It would also fit a normal sized prime lens. The small is small, and will fit small primes and classic primes.I hope that they come out with wider versions next. I would take all of my Canon L lenses out of the cheap leather socks they supply and put them in these things. Luckily, Sigma supplies excellent soft cases so I&rsquo;m good there.To top it off there&rsquo;s a nice micro fiber cleaning cloth - you can never have too many of these things! Great for lenses, glasses and cleaning any of your photo gear. This one went into one of my camera bags.Pros:- inexpensive- good sizes- look nice- soft liner- nice micro fiber cleaning cloth- Guarantee: Altura Photo products are designed and manufactured to meet the highest industry standards of performance and quality. If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with any Altura Photo product we will take it back without questions or hassles.Cons- Need a wider seriesAll in all a great product - and this will be the one I buy again. If you&rsquo;ve got standard sized primes and zooms (ie. EF-S and Sigma DC series) these will do just fine. If you&rsquo;ve got big L lenses with stabilization, they&rsquo;re not wide enough. The photos they use for examples are spot-on, so use those for your guide. 5 stars.*** Update <strong><em>I&rsquo;ve already ordered another set.I&rsquo;m not at all convinced of the shedding issue, although I must say it worried me at first until I actually saw the material in person and used the cases.</em></strong> Update <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> ***I ordered the large 4 piece set, as I&rsquo;ve acquired or been sent some gear for evaluation. I&rsquo;m loving having all my clamps, rails, plates, heads etc. coddled in luxury. 2 New comments. 1) nothing eventful has happened with these - a few get used out in the field. 2) the latest batch is a very different purple color. The first were a deep, almost burgundy purple. The latest batch is lavender. Much closer to what is pictured (you can see my photos). The lining matches. So I suppose the only addition I have is that there seems to be some variation in batch-to-batch dye lots, but the quality seems identical. I&rsquo;m actually fine with this, as it helps differentiate the contents.As I wound up with so many of these and keep them in drawers, I&rsquo;m using colored Carabiner clips on these so I can quickly identify which one has what in it. Markable key tags on key rings could also help. I&rsquo;ve done something similar with my Canon lenses, as all the gray bags look pretty much identical!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pouches are excellent. Just buy &lsquo;em, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-steal-great-price-great-protection">A steal, great price, great protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the medium after buying the cover for my canon prime 50 mm 1.4 with lens hood. Note I feel the pouches are a tad smaller than the &ldquo;oversized&rdquo; ones Canon makes. personally for the price, if in doubt, buy two sizes, you cant go wrong for price,, buy bigger. The pouch is very well made,, outside seems water proof and inside is super smooth,, I would have no issue putting the most expensive lens inside. The walls of pouch are very thick so it does feel &ldquo;foamy&rdquo;, however does easily &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; into my camera case. I will definitely buy from again. I believe these protect my lens better than the Canon ones I got on all my L lens, that seem to stiff at bottom and too flimsy higher up. These pouches, although more stiffer, I feel protect all of the lens. The added lens cloth is handy, and the vendor is fast to ship and pouch comes well protected in shipping. all in all, a steal. again only caveats, they do run a tad small, so go up in size, and realize they are more foamy rigid in protection than a Canon &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; one.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-and-well-made">Beautiful and well made!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality of these is phenomenal! I am just starting out so I literally only have a small portrait lens but I&rsquo;m hoping to get into photography as a professional freelance photographer and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be getting more lenses in the future. For the cost it made more sense to buy this set than to buy the cases individually down the line. Plus I would be risking them not being available anymore or them changing the colors or something and I want them all to match. They are nice and thick and the inside is SO soft I don&rsquo;t have to worry about my lenses getting scratched or damaged. They stay tightly closed too so I also don&rsquo;t have to worry about my lenses flying out of the cases and getting damaged! They are well worth the money and I love the colors, mine are black and purple, not sure if they are changing the colors or plan to in the future but they are absolutely gorgeous! They don&rsquo;t feel cheesy or like they won&rsquo;t last, they are definitely high quality!</p>

<h5 id="i-purchased-the-3-pack-based-on-all-the-great-reviews-and-loved-the-sizing-guidelines-with-the-camera">I purchased the 3 pack based on all the great reviews and loved the sizing guidelines with the camera &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 3 pack based on all the great reviews and loved the sizing guidelines with the camera lenses next to them. I did find that the Large did not fit my tamron 70-200 so I contacted the company to ask whether the xlarge should fit. They responded so quickly and actually sent me the size I was looking for. I used the 3 pack in a brand new unique camera backpack for a week long trip to NYC with business and social photography shoots. These pouches were PERFECT and protected my gear while fitting snugly in the pack. I now have more pouches and will continue to purchase these as I vary my camera bag/purse/backpack carrying cases often. I am assured that I will not break my cameras or lenses. Had I purchased these earlier, I would have saved $150.00 to fit the lost dial on my Canon 5d III. Lesson learned. Protect the gear. I will also try out the clips on my double Rapid straps at my next event shoot. I&rsquo;ve also had 2 prime lenses lose their focus ability because I did not put them in secure pouches when I first began photography. I have been using a very bulky case to carry them in and feel freedom to lighten my load with these new pouches. I would highly reccommend them and the price is nothing, when it comes to our expensive camera gear.</p>
