<h5 id="almost-as-good-as-a-hero-4-black-at-a-better-price">Almost as good as a hero 4 Black at a better price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I just received the Yi 4k action cam from my pre-order a few months ago. There was no tracking or now shipping information; it simply showed up. The camera feels well made and the battery is noticeably larger than my hero 4 black edition. The touch screen is very easy to use and very responsive and controls, in general, are easier to use than a hero 4.Build quality is in the same category as the hero 4 so if you plan on taking it into extreme weather or water, you&rsquo;ll need a case. I&rsquo;m still on the fence about image quality.My first impressions are:The field of view isn&rsquo;t as wide as my hero 4 backSize is almost IdenticalScreen on the back of the Yi is beautifulAudio is good, but the USB audio option on the hero is betterVideo quality is similar though Hero 4 has more contrastI&rsquo;ll post more as I get a chance to test these two cameras out. The Hero 4 is getting a run for the money with the Yi 4k action camera, but there are a few trade-offs&rsquo;.Update 7/13/16: I had a chance to download and setup the Yi action camera app on my Samsung S7. Setup and linking my phone with the camera takes <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the time it takes on my hero 4 black edition. Once linked, the video playback is clear with very low latency, compared to my hero 4, I would say almost real time (maybe 20-30ms delay) and the controls are very easy to use. Video playback via phone is also very snappy.The boot time on the Yi 4k action cam is less than 2 seconds which is also much much faster than the Hero 4 black edition. I&rsquo;ve also tested out the image stabilization at 1080p, and it is very impressive. Handling shake almost completely disappears.On the downside, there is no HDMI output so if you are looking for that option, you are out of luck. Also, while the price is $249, if you want a case $12, External charger and batteries $18, none cellphone remote $20, you should really consider this a $300 action camera if you want any of the extras that come with many of the gopro lineup.Update 7/14/16: Updated Firmware to version 1.0.9 from the Yi website. Found an AV out via usb feature added under the advanced tab in video mode. Tested the Yi action camera out with a 128GB memory card and with 4k video recording on I now have the ability to record 4 hours 32 min on a 128GB card. Also here&rsquo;s the list of possible options for photograph/video recording:Photo modeTimer modeBurst modeVideo modeTime lapse Video modeSlow motion modeTime Lapse Photo modeLoop modeVideo+photo modeUpdate 7/17/16: A number of people have asked about grayed out features and file splitting so I thought I&rsquo;d add this to the review. Basically some extra features like Image Stabilization, auto low light, and adjust lens distortion are only available in certain settings and modes. If you are shooting &ldquo;4k ultra&rdquo; all three of those features will be grayed out. Switch over to 1080p and you&rsquo;ll have all three of them available. This is because the camera is using the extra pixels on the sensor to stabilize, add light, and correct distortion. As for file splitting. Mine splits files at the 4GB mark which is a limit of the file system used on the card (FAT32), this gives you about 7 to 8 min worth of video in each clip at the cameras data rate. If you would like to correct that problem, format your memory cards in the camera and your cards will be formatted to exFAT. Also, note that when the camera creates a file it also creates a smaller version of the file with the label &ldquo;_thm&rdquo; that version of the file is used for cell phone wifi viewing and is basically a low-resolution copy of the actual recording. Hope the helps!7/18/16 Firmware version 1.0.12 out, fixes some memory card issues and adds housing mode that allows camera modes to be changed with a long press.7/28/16 Firmware Version 1.0.13 is out. Yi has added &ldquo;Yi color&rdquo; and &ldquo;flat&rdquo; color modes. Very similar to Protune mode on my hero 4 black edition.8/5/16 Firmware Version 1.1.0 is out. The start-up screen has been updated with a list of recommended MicroSD cards and a sharpness setting has been added.9/19/16 Firmware version 1.2.3 is out. They&rsquo;ve added 24fps in 4k and in other modes. Yi color and flat picture style has changed a small amount and 24fps in 4k now has the label &ldquo;ultra&rdquo;. &ldquo;In house mode&rdquo; has been updated for single button use and image stabilization now works in 2.7k mode. Low light was also added to the menu.</p>

<h5 id="my-fault-kinda">my fault&hellip;kinda</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d give this camera just above 4 stars. The camera arrived quickly and in excellent condition. No blemishes etc. The touch screen looks bright and clear with no dead pixels and it responds to touch commands quickly. My buddy owns a new version of a different brand of action camera (the big name), and he is jealous now. Half the cost and a touch screen to boot. 4k looks amazing, as does the other resolutions.My only warning, do not stray from the ”approved/supported memory list&rdquo;. I bought a 64gb lexar 1800x microSD thinking that it could only be better to have 1800x over the listed/supported 1000x. But better isn&rsquo;t always better. I got multiple SD card read errors, no SD card errors and about half of my files were corrupted from strange reboots and freezes. I replaced this card with one on the supported media page, SanDisk, and all is well again.So read the supported media page and don&rsquo;t stray. You&rsquo;ll have a 5stars experience</p>

<h5 id="tiny-but-powerful-got-it-for-my-son-for">Tiny but powerful! Got it for my son for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tiny but powerful! Got it for my 11 year old son for Christmas in place of the Gopro 5. The LCD screen is clear and has a touch screen. Very easy to use.My son absolutely LOVES this camera. He was skeptical at first because of the brand. We took it to the pool and got some amazing high quality 4K videos! As a photographer I&rsquo;m quite impressed with the quality. I love the different lens options. The color is true to life which is very important in digital imaging.I have a few negative remarks related to the Yi App:1. Live mode disconnects when he was underwater. We were afraid it cut off, but it does continue to record.2. The app has some great features, but it was hard to figure out how to save the videos on his iPad. He has to send them to himself via iMessage in order to post on Instagram or Facebook. He gave up after a while.3. Also, you have to connect to the camera&rsquo;s wifi and go through the record option to access the gallery of videos. Kind of a pain. This is also related to the app. Maybe there&rsquo;s a way to save them directly, and we haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet.Otherwise this camera does everything the GoPro can do for half the cost! We are looking forward to getting outdoors and filming our adventures thanks to the Yi 4K action camera. My son keeps thanking me for this gift which means he&rsquo;s happy and that&rsquo;s all that matters!</p>
