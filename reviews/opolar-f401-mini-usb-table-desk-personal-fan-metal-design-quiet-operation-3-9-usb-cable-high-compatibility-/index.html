<h5 id="love-this-very-quiet">LOVE THIS! VERY QUIET :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best fan for my desk ever. Whoever worked my desk before me left a 4&rdquo; Hawaiian breeze fan, and it was so terrible. It made a bunch of noise and was ugly.This fan that I just purchased it great! It plugs right into the USB port on my desk top at work, and it is so quiet (compared to my previous one) so it doesn&rsquo;t bug anyone in the cubicle next to me! In the picture, one blade looks pink, but they&rsquo;re all the same color I swear, haha. It was just the glare of the lighting. This pic shows it next to an average sized water bottle.Love this product, would definitely recommend and buy again.</p>

<h5 id="great-usb-powered-fan">Great USB Powered Fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the coolest little fan that has a large capacity to blow air. I was looking for a small USB powered fan that I could use at work as my office gets very hot in the afternoon as well as at other times. I also run swim meets and it gets very hot at the pool - the fan helps to keep us cool while sitting for so long! I was very impressed with the fan as it is all metal including metal blades. I did not want a fan with plastic housing and plastic blades. I also needed it to be powered by a USB port as plugs are not readily available. The fan housing is a nice shiny black and blades are silver. The USB cord is about 3 feet long. The fan itself is about 6 inches wide and 6 inches tall. It is quiet when running and surprisingly moves a lot of air. I like the fact that it is small, portable, and easy to move and use. I just plug it into the USB Port, press the on switch, and feel the comfort of a nice breeze! Overall, I am very pleased with this item and would buy it again. Reviewed by G. Swanson</p>

<h5 id="great-price-low-noise-plenty-of-air-transfer">Great price, low noise, plenty of air transfer:)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great! I looked through a bunch of different options on these, of course I have been working with computers and assorted peripherals as well as networks for 20+ years now, so I am a bit different from most shoppers you will see on the internet just due to experience I have been on the internet before it was called the internet and have been shopping through it for pretty much the entire time it has been alive and offered it.Anyway these have everything I could see anyone wanting. Some people want a plug in fan, some even like battery operated in this specific instance which I do not understand at all but to each his or her own right. My primary concerns with this was will it offer enough power in wind transfer going through USB and would it be loud. This one did it all right so I made the right choice completely. The level of air transfer to me is perfect and the noise is ignorable which were my prime requisites and which were easily met by this fan.It was also not expensive and from what I can actively see made with good components. The second plus is I ordered two and they were used by 2 different people in two completely different locations yet they work the same exactly.I would buy them again if necessary for another location without question.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-little-fan">Love this little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this little fan, especially the fact it has an on/off switch. Everyone else in the office likes it much hotter than I, so I keep this on top of my desktop computer and point it right at me. It moves an impressive amount of air. It is not whisper quiet, but still fairly quiet and not at all disruptive.</p>

<h5 id="but-still-good-cool-air">but still good, cool air</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the fan today, thanks for the quick shipping! I was looking for a fan to go on my desk at work. I am at the front desk and did not want something loud, small, but still good, cool air. The fan is such a quiet one and would actually be perfect at home while going to sleep. The sound is actually calming. I would only say that at home you would need to place it on a nightstand or such that is close to your bed to receive the benefit the cool air. At the desk it is perfect and I actually had to push it over to the other side of my desk. Also I wanted a small fan that had a nice look for the front desk. I went with the black fan. Perfect and looked very nice. I actually received several nice compliments and 2 people asking me where I purchased it so they could as well. It&rsquo;s something I will keep in mind for friends at Christmas in the office. One last thing I would like to comment on was the concerns about the fan drawing to much power from your laptop at work. That was the one thing that almost held me back from purchasing it, but I figured I would ask after receiving it. Two of the people from IT assured me it would be fine and didn&rsquo;t draw enough to worry about. Loving my little fan! Oh, quality is very good!</p>

<h5 id="stay-cool-with-this-little-fan">Stay Cool with this Little Fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this fan every single week day. I sit in the back row of a 100-person medical lecture hall at Duke University. The back row is about 4-5 feet higher than the bottom row, and is next to the windows that face the afternoon sun. Given that the windows aren&rsquo;t thermally broken, it can get really warm in the back row. Sometimes, 5-8 degrees warmer in the back row than the first row. I felt like one of those ladies in a John Grisham novel, busily waving a paper fan at my face in the swampy, punishing Bayou heat of a creaky old wood-coffered court room. Enter this little USB-powered desktop fan. Who know something so little and cheap could make a miserable situation totally acceptable? This little guy is the envy of my neighbors. Within a week or two, guess who had similar fans next to their laptops too? Yup - my classmates in the back row. I&rsquo;ve started a movement, you guys! Ha. #StayCool. Lastly - the fan is super quiet but makes a lovely kind of white noise that I love having as background noise in class while I listen to lectures or take exams. #RelaxAndStayCool</p>

<h5 id="good-construction-and-fairly-quiet">good construction and fairly quiet</h5>

<p>Works well, good construction and fairly quiet. Just wish it had speed switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="still-going-after-nine-months-of-continuous-use">Still going after nine months of continuous use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan sits on my desk at work, and I&rsquo;ve left it running continuously for the past nine months, with zero issues. It&rsquo;s sturdy, and quieter than I&rsquo;d hoped. No complaints.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="only-one-speed-and-noticeable-hum">Only one speed and noticeable hum</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For such a small fan it makes quite a loud hum, very noticeable in my quiet office. There is only one speed - loud - and doesn&rsquo;t push a lot of air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="only-one-speed-setting-and-not-that-quite">Only one speed setting and not that quite.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only one speed. Has a constant humming sound. Noticeable to coworkers and a little distracting for me to be on my desk.I wish it had a low setting that was also quite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome little fan but has a lot of power. Perfect for my cubical at work.</p>

<h5 id="it-had-the-expected-air-flow-for-its-size">It had the expected air flow for its size, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It had the expected air flow for its size, so I didn&rsquo;t give it a two star for that. However it stopped working in about two months even though I did not use it heavily.</p>

<p>Perfect for the office. I&rsquo;m constantly transmitting on the radio and talking on the phone at work, and so is everyone else around me.</p>
