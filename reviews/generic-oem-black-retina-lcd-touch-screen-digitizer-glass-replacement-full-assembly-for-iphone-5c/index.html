<h5 id="almost-too-good-to-be-true-perfecto">Almost Too Good To Be True - Perfecto</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product was purchased because the price looked great and it was needed to repair a Verizon iPhnoe 5c. The product arrived well packaged by the seller and was sealed and obviously quality inspected. After installation, the touch part of the screen was verified for functionality and the screen was verified for any kind of flaws. What was found was the following:1. Perfect and well functional digitizer2. Zero defects in the LCD/OLED3. No Backlight Defects4. Frame bezel assembly was well attached and clips were balanced correct5. Zero Flaws were found in craftmanshipSummary:This company knows how to produce super high quality for a huge bargain kind of price. I loved them so much, I bought from them again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-it">Get it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as it should. I Will continue to use this vendors for parts in the future.I own a brick and mortar cell phone, computer (Mac and PC) tablet, and CB radio repair shop.So I know what to look for and what prices would be considered fair. That being said I have no problem recommending this part from this seller to customers or other people in the industry. I have a huge foot print and I do business shops all across the country.I do a lot of micro soldering for other shops as well.Get it, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-too-bad-too">It&rsquo;s too bad, too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased a replacement assembly from miracle124. The home button went in correctly, but the side tabs that hold the heat shield are too short by about 1-2mm. In order to get the four screws in the holes of the tabs, two on each side of the screen, you must pull down the metal band that goes into the channel of the case. Once the screws are in, the heat shield puts pressure on the LCD in those four spots and applies pressure throughout the LCD because the shield becomes deformed.Once installed, the LCD shows large white spots and other issues caused by the pressure on the LCD from the heat shield. Also, the glass glued to the LCD is much higher then the sides of the case because the black bands on the sides assembly were lowered.The unit I received was manufactured intentionally with the wrong specs. Because of this, I suspect that they made a whole run with the wrong measurements. It&rsquo;s too bad, too. I was fine with the fit and finish and the assembly as a whole, and I&rsquo;d buy these again, but only after I&rsquo;m assured that the correction was made and they fit properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This did not come with a screen protector, wipes or boxed packaging. It came in a standard yellow package you would get and phone case in, which worried me about any defects in the product. When putting the new screen on I notice the area by the camera is spaced out so getting the camera centered is tricky. Just when I thought I got it in place, I put the screen back in my phone and the camera had moved again. I can still get a good picture, you can just visibly see the camera is off to the left side. The screen has a few dead spots. I can not click the h, y, b, and v on my keyboard. And when typing in my password I have to click slowly and fairly hard. I&rsquo;m pretty disappointed actually. I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t expect much for my new screen not getting fixed professionally.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-oem-buy-a-different-one">Not OEM. Buy a different one.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When the title says Generic OEM, I should have looked elsewhere.The screen was clearly not OEM quality. The packaging was sketchy. The tools and everything seemed solid though, so I feel like the product wasn&rsquo;t a complete scam, I just got a bad one (and not OEM).Many sellers are selling here with this item, so you have no idea if you will get a decent one or not. You can roll the dice if you like. Amazon does accept the returns quite painlessly.After install, only <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the screen worked. The part that worked looked very low resolution and faded. I returned. My purchase of a different item (look for DRT_ST) went perfectly, and works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-worst-product-i-have-ever-purchased">This is the worst product I have ever purchased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I order the item on October 6th and didn&rsquo;t received the item till almost 2 months later. The item did not come as was shown in the photos. The photos show the screen comes with tools, which it does not. I contacted the seller about receiving tracking information for my item and they told me that because I didn&rsquo;t order &ldquo;expedited shipping&rdquo; I could not receive tracking information. Once I finally received the item, the screen was defective. The center of the touch screen did not work at all. I am very disappointed by this. If you are looking to purchase a screen, buy elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-money-or-aggravation-glass-was-not-cut-correctly">not worth the money or aggravation, glass was not cut correctly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This the cheapest quality screen I have seen so far out of about 100 or more screens I have ordered from different people, the home button glass was not cut out correctly and you can see the part where it was missed, so in order to get the home button to fit I had to take a piece of sandpaper and roll it up and fit it inside the home button hole and sand it down very gently for about 45 minutes before the home button actually fit. and then when I went to put it back together the clip on the top right where it holds the screen in place was a little bit different and it was pushing the screen back out so I had to cut that off, definitely not worth the money or in this case the aggravation to get it to work properly&hellip; find somebody with better reviews even if its more money it&rsquo;s definitely worth it</p>
