<p>Style:Travel Scope 70 with Backpack
Product Description
This telescope was designed with traveling in mind while offering exceptional value. The Travel Scope is made of the highest quality materials to ensure stability and durability. All this adds up to a telescope that gives you a lifetime of pleasure with a minimal amount of maintenance. Featuring a compact and portable design with ample optical performance, the Travel Scope is ideal for terrestrial as well as casual astronomical observation.</p>

<p>Amazon.com
The Celestron 21035 Travel Scope 70 is a compact 70mm refractor telescope optimized for portability and convenience. The telescope, the tripod, and all the accessories fit conveniently into a padded backpack style soft carrying case. The complete accessory package includes a 45 degree correct image prism, a 20mm eyepiece for 20X magnification, and a 10mm eyepiece for 40X. The fully illustrated instruction manual is supplemented by a copy of &ldquo;The Sky X&rdquo; astronomy software that turns your PC into a virtual planetarium.</p>

<p>With a focal length of 400mm and a focal ratio of f/5.7, the Travel Scope 70 compares surprisingly well with popular f/5 &ldquo;Short Tube 80&rdquo; refractors but at a much lower cost. The Travel Scope 70 uses a number of plastic components to keep the cost and weight down, including a plastic focuser and plastic lens shade, but the all glass lenses deliver beautiful views of backyard birds during the daytime and lovely views of the Moon and stars at night.</p>

<p>The Travel Scope 70 offers daytime views that compare with more expensive spotting scopes. The 20mm eyepiece gives 20X magnification and a 2.5 degree field of view, with plenty of crisp detail when I’m looking at backyard birds. The travel Scope 70 is also quick and easy to set up at night. The deep orange glow of the recent Lunar Eclipse was simply gorgeous, and I was even able to take some pictures using the Travel Scope 70 and a PowerShot camera. When I look at Jupiter using the 10mm eyepiece (40X magnification) I can easily see four moons near the planet. And rich field views of the Milky Way are often at their best in a small scope with a wide field of view.</p>

<p>The tripod included with the Travel Scope 70 is described as a “full size photo tripod”, but I like it best as a table-top tripod with the legs kept short. The tripod is designed to be light and compact, but that means the legs are thin and wobbly when fully extended. &ndash;Jeff Phillips</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Light, portable, and affordable
Excellent wide field views
Padded backpack style case
High and low power eyepieces
The Sky X software included
Cons:</p>

<p>Light weight tripod
Plastic finder and focuser</p>

<h5 id="excellent-telescope">Excellent telescope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing telescope. I have used a number of telescopes and this is one of the best based on flexibility, ease of use and performance. When mounted on a simple Eq. tracking mount I am getting better pictures than with my C925 that has been a significant source of disappointment. For this price there is no better telescope in the market.Just edited my original review to add a few photos I took last winter, including lovely comet Lovejoy. These photos are from a really dark place and were processed with Photoshop. However, I just needed a 1-minute exposure at 6400 ISO with my Canon DSLR connected directly to the rear of the telescope (no diagonal). Then I mounted the telescope on a regular Eq. Mount (an additional advantage of this telescope is that it is very light so no heavy duty mount is required&hellip; however it needs to be properly aligned and you need to be careful not to touch the camera, telescope or mount when taking a photo to avoid vibration). When I bought this telescope I was needing the equivalent of a 400mm to 600mm lens for my Canon DSLR. These lenses cost several thousand dollars so I bought instead this telescope as it was a very low risk investment compared to the potential benefits. As you can see it really paid off&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-scope-terrible-tripod">Great little scope, terrible tripod</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scope is extremely easy to set up out of the box. This was purchased as a first scope for our 13 year old nephew and he loved it. With only a couple of pieces to attach it was very simple for him set up alone and get outside to use it. I will caution that this tripod is pretty terrible and the only reason it doesn&rsquo;t get five stars. I did not expect anything fancy and for what he plans to use it for it&rsquo;s manageable, but it is very cheap, weak, and can barely hold the weight of the scope, even when on slight angles. He was unable to get it locked down and I had to really twist as hard as possible to get it to tighten up enough to hold the scope steady and I felt like it was going to snap. Honestly the cheap tripod I use with my DSLR is more heavy duty and sturdy than this thing.Overall I think it&rsquo;s a great little starter scope, is super user friendly even for beginners, and can tell he&rsquo;s going to love using it. However I will certainly be looking for a bit more sturdy of a tripod.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-telescope">good telescope&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a good beginner&rsquo;s telescope. Assembly is easy. Was able to see moon very clearly. It takes some time to get a hang of it. Still getting used to it. When you look at stars, it won&rsquo;t be much of a difference&hellip;.they look same as you would with naked eye maybe a bit bigger. Next goal is to watch other planets. I will appreciate any help/tips with it :)</p>

<h5 id="have-loved-this-telescope">Have loved this telescope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have loved this telescope. It is good for looking at the Blue Ridge mountains and local scenery as well as the night sky. Got a great view of our last full moon. It is not a far ranging astronomy telescope. However if I had an astronomy scope I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it during the daytime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought one for 12 year old grandson for his birthday. Wanted one that he could take with him easily. He is now enjoying using this on vacation. We liked it so well that we ordered another for us. Yes, the tripod could be sturdier when fully extended, but it&rsquo;s not reason enough to not buy this scope. Camera tripod is always an option. We don&rsquo;t find that it&rsquo;s necessary. Great buy for the money.</p>
