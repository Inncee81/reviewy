<h5 id="great-for-teaching-kids-e">Great for teaching kids (e</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for teaching kids (e.g., 8 and under) to throw and catch (especially pop-flys), with less fear of getting hit by the ball. These balls hurt way less when hit in the face than a normal baseball. Kids who are afraid of regular balls will learn bad form, and don&rsquo;t try to catch the tough ones. There are problems using these in batting (they break pretty quickly) and grounders (they bounce more than regular balls), so we use a mix of regular balls for batting/grounders and these safety balls for practicing catching. Every coach-pitch level of baseball should start the season with these softer balls for teaching how to throw and catch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-expected-wanted-and-needed">Just what I expected, wanted, and needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good quality and a great way to introduce young people to the art of catching a ball. A memory from my own childhood when I got beaned real good with fly-ball prompted me to start my young baseball player with a ball that would not be quite as hurtful as an official hardball. And the foresight paid off when novice coordination resulted in a ricochet to the face. I could tell my little princess was shocked and a little intimidated at the experience, but I&rsquo;m sure the softness of this ball helped a lot and let her shake it off and work back to some confidence as she learned basic skills. So highly recommended for young folks figuring things out. Not too bad an idea for us old folks either who have lost some of our youthful agility and skill.</p>

<h5 id="a-couple-practices-the-seems-are-starting-to-fray-pretty-good-not-sure-they-ll-last-all-season">&hellip; a couple practices the seems are starting to fray pretty good. Not sure they&rsquo;ll last all season</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a couple practices the seems are starting to fray pretty good. Not sure they&rsquo;ll last all season. The cover is pretty slippery as well so need to scuff the surface up a little bit.<em>Update</em> These balls won&rsquo;t up all that long. The seems are falling apart after 7 practices and that&rsquo;s just letting the kids use them to throw. I was using one to do infield practice but after a couple grounders the ball basically fell apart so I switched back to real baseball&rsquo;s. These aren&rsquo;t all that bad but don&rsquo;t expect to get a ton of use out of them before you need to chuck them in the trash.</p>

<h5 id="used-this-with-my-son-to-help-him-overcome-his-fear-of-getting-hit-by-ball-like-smalls-on-the-sandlot">Used this with my son to help him overcome his fear of getting hit by ball like Smalls on The Sandlot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well built and have lasted me for a year without any problems. The key to extending the life of product is to only use for throwing practice. Item is soft and is able to be squeezed with the hand and so extended use for batting practice will cause deformities and premature failure of product.Used this with my son to help him overcome his fear of getting hit by ball like Smalls on The Sandlot. The feel is slightly different than real ball, but negligible in my opinion. Be aware that ball is bouncy, but is nice since throws that are short of mark often bounce high enough to be caught with minimal effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-beginners">Great For Beginners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great for your little ball player. They have the size, weight and almost the feel of a real baseball. The outer shell is softer which is great for kids who are scared of getting hit by the ball while playing catch. My kids were always afraid of getting &ldquo;in front of the ball&rdquo;. On the few occasions that they missed and were hit by these balls, they were less afraid. These balls helped my little ones to learn how to play and love the game of baseball.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-for-beginners">Great value for beginners.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for beginners. I used this over the summer with my 5 year old son who is pretty good at catch but occasionally takes a direct hit to the face. I&rsquo;m not sure how long they will last but guessing if you just play catch and don&rsquo;t hit them with a bat they will last a few years. Either way, for the price they are great.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great pair of softer baseballs that have proven perfect for practice combined with a pitch back net that we bought our grandson for Christmas. As an &ldquo;add on&rdquo; purchase, GREAT value!!!!!</p>

<p>Our grandson enjoys the balls better than a regular baseball. The safety balls have a softer feel to them. However, it still can hurt when hit by one.</p>

<p>Seem to be the weight and size of a baseball with a little cushioning for grip and reduced pain from impact (how much, who knows). These are really good starter baseballs.</p>
