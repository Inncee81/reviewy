<p>100% Pure and Natural Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils. The Highest Quality Available. Made with Love. Backed by Research.</p>

<p>Tea tree essential oil is a must have for your home&hellip;</p>

<p>Tea tree essential oil is a naturally powerful solution that will make you and your family feel more empowered during sickness and throughout your everyday lives. This essential oil is well-known for its intense purifying and cleansing properties, often being used to clear breathing, purify the air in our homes, calm skin irritations, and even ward off head lice. This is powerful stuff!</p>

<p>Centuries ago, the leaves of the Melaleuca tree were gathered, crushed and inhaled to promote clear breathing. The leaves were also often laid directly onto the skin for a cooling effect. We&rsquo;ve come a long way since, and we invite you to discover all that tea tree essential oil has to offer.</p>

<p>The Primary Benefits of Tea Tree Essential Oil:
 
Helps promote a healthy immune system
Helps protect against seasonal and environmental threats
Well-known for its cleansing and rejuvinating effects on the skin</p>

<p>Cleanse. Invigorate. Soothe.
Why should you choose the EOL brand?</p>

<p>Our business is family owned and operated, and we got started with essential oils not because we wanted to make money, but because we had a family need for better health and lifestyle alternatives. We quickly became passionate about essential oils, and that passion has since evolved into a commitment to helping others. We started this business because we saw a need, and we knew that because we cared, we could fill that need better than anyone else.</p>

<p>Our Customers Are Always on our Minds
Originally, we were the customers, so we understand and sympathize with the struggle to find accessible, high quality essential oils in today’s market. Our products are sourced, created, packaged and distributed with you in mind. All EOL essential oils are…
100% pure and natural
Sourced from sustainable farms
Free of chemicals, additives and fillers</p>

<p>We care about you. We care about the quality of the products you use in your home and around your loved ones. And we care about making those products accessible, and effective.
Here are a few ways to use your new tea tree essential oil&hellip;</p>

<p>CLEANSE YOUR HOME!</p>

<p>Tea tree oil boasts powerful cleansing and purifying properties, and can do wonders when used throughout the home. </p>

<p>Simply add a few drops of tea tree oil to a spray bottle with water and vinegar, and use it to wipe down surfaces throughout your home. 
BANISH BACTERIA!</p>

<p>To promote healthy teeth and gums, and to ensure your toothbrush stays bacteria-free for as long as possible, add a drop of tea tree essential oil directly to your toothbrush before brushing. 
PROMOTE CLEAR, HEALTHY SKIN!</p>

<p>Tea tree oil can also be used to keep your skin looking and feeling its best. </p>

<p>Add a drop of tea tree oil in with your nightly moisturizer to keep acne at bay!</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="we-are-very-pleased-because-for-the-last-year-she-has-been-using">We are very pleased because for the last year she has been using &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this because we heard that tea tree oil would get rid of warts. It has a much stronger scent than other tea tree oils that I have bought. My daughter has been putting it on her planters wart for a few days now and there is a marked improvement. The smaller wart already looks dead. We are very pleased because for the last year she has been using the acid stick prescribed by the doctor with little results. She also had it dug out once but it grew back. It has been very frustrating. This tea tree oil also came with a dropper for added convenience. I am hopeful that this product will solve our problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="confident-purchase">Confident purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived well packaged. Smells great. The oil has a strong tea tree scent and appears to be very fresh. The dropper is very helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-the-best-brands-i-used">One the best brands I used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One the best brands I used, I also like that it comes with suggestions on other uses that I never knew about. I will definitively will purchase it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="give-it-a-shot">Give it a shot!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am new to OL but I thought I would try this for a few small tags. What I will say is that I was impress with the customer service. I was asked about my package and received regular follow ups. The plus was that I asked what else could be done with tea tree oils and I received a pamflet&hellip;so next going to try detangler for my twins hair and an overnight deep conditioner as they have very course and dry hair :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-to-be-working-for-the-tie-nail-fungus">Seems to be working for the tie nail fungus.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have been using it for toe nail fungus for last two months. Have started noticing some difference. Will continue to use for few more weeks to see if it completely gets rid of fungus or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sorcery">Sorcery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: The itchiness returned at the 20 hour mark but I rewashed the areas and reapplied the oil and all is well again.I bought this product back in December and have been putting off writing a review. I have been using this tea tree oil for my face. I mix it in with my face moisturizer before bed and before I do my make-up (I just let it sit for 5 minutes). I had a really bad break out and this cleared it up nicely. It of course took some time but my face looks great. This is also a great product to use for a rouge pimple. I just dab a little bit lightly onto the pimple with a cottonball and let it sit for a few hours or overnight. Even though this product seemed to work for me and my sensitive skin it wasn&rsquo;t enough for me to put in an actual effort and write a review, until last night. I was out playing with my dogs and took them on a walk. I live in the south and had forgotten to wear bug spray and got bit all over. Like I had mentioned before, I have INCREDIBLY sensitive skin and I knew these bug bites would scar and live a little rash after the itching left and I really didn&rsquo;t want to deal with that. As soon as I got home I searched my cabinets for a home remedy but couldn&rsquo;t find anything, until I remembered my oil. I thought, &ldquo;What the heck, it can&rsquo;t possibly make it any worse.&rdquo; I used about a drop on each spot. It took about 30 minutes for it to work but the itching stopped! I fell asleep shortly after and when I woke up I had completely forgotten that I had been mauled my mosquitoes. It&rsquo;s been more than 12 hours and I can hardly tell where I was bitten. I see just very light red areas but there is no itching and no raised skin. I will update if I need to reapply, but if I don&rsquo;t then I&rsquo;ll be certain that this is some incredible form of sorcery.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-great">So Far So GREAT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>added to my diffuser, used in washer And dryer (awesome cleaning tool for that). Have used it on my nails, shiny they are now just like my hair. best buy, the 4oz!!i got 2 and will need more soon. has worked excellently around my patio to steer off bugs (mosquitoes) Excellent mixed with white vinegar &amp; water for cleaning &ldquo;green&rdquo;, and it really cleans well.</p>
