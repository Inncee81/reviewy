<h5 id="would-be-a-great-boat-but">Would be a great boat, but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it for class 1-3 rapids as I used it on the Upper New River in WV and it boat itself handled really well as per several whitewater raft guides that are on the rivers all the time. The boat took the rapids good but there are a few very annoying flaws in the boat. The boat I received was miss-stitched on the bottom so that when you blew up the boat, one side tube sat sidewise that made the boat asymmetrical and which made the floor sit crooked on the bottom. The floor actually made a bulge on the bottom of the boat making it rounded and didn&rsquo;t sit flat. Because of this, the boat also sat somewhat sideways in the water.The worse thing about the boat is that the boat has bladders, which isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad but it makes maintenance very difficult. Even if you use the boat on a regular basis, both water and sand get in between the bladder and the cover which should be dried and the sand washed out before you put the boat away other wise the grit will make holes and the water left over will mold.The boat would be a 5 star boat if there were no removable bladders and the floor was all one piece and of course sewed without flaws and puckers in the bottom. I probably would not take a chance on another one of these because of these few problems which I believe are significant.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend-this-kayak">Highly recommend this kayak!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We originally purchased the Sea Eagle 370 Pro Package due to more reviews. We ended up returning that unit as it did not track well in the water at all and simply felt too similar in build quality to the $100 inflatables to justify it&rsquo;s price.We are thrilled we ordered this one. It feels much better built for a similar price and tracks far better (though still not as well as a hard-shell). The nylon covering over the air bladders gives extra piece of mind about punctures and is more comfortable to work around (no rubber rash). The only real downside is this does not come in a kit so ordering a pump and paddles adds a bit of cost.We ended up with the airhead pump (works great) and tried the airhead 84&rdquo; paddles. We found the 84&rdquo; airhead paddles to be well-built, but a bit short due to the width of the air bladders. We ended up with some 96&rdquo; seasense paddles and love them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-originally-was-looking-at-the-nrs-outlaw-2">Very good! Originally was looking at the NRS Outlaw 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good! Originally was looking at the NRS Outlaw 2. But wasn&rsquo;t able to afford it when I needed a boat. Dropped down to this one and was pessimistic because of the price. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely not NRS, but this boat felt like it should be worth a lot more. The stitching isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it tracks pretty well for an inflatable. My wife and I accidentally took it down several class 3s and a class 4. We flipped on the class 4. The boat took some nasty rubs against the rocks, but remains inflated with no holes or loss of pressure. Solid build.I probably wouldn&rsquo;t get the single version, though. All of the videos that I have seen showing it not tracking very well at all. But I think the added length and weight of the 2 seater makes the tracking tolerable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="once-we-got-that-we-love-it-separately-we-bought-an-electric-air-pump">Once we got that we love it, Separately we bought an electric air pump</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We took it out on the lake for the first time today. It is rocksolid. The only difficulties we had was figuring out how to adjust the seats. Once we got that we love it, Separately we bought an electric air pump, and a manual air pump. The electric makes it easy to inflate the bulk of it. And the hand pump allows you to top it off with just the right amount of pressure. It&rsquo; is essentially as good as a solid kayak! We love it!.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were RVing in the Florida Keys, going into withdrawal from lack of a boat. Ordered the Airhead and were able to paddle around to hearts our content. The boat is surprisingly well constructed and fairly comfortable. It doesn&rsquo;t quite handle as good as a hard sided kayak, but it is still very functional.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="orange-boat">Orange Boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Inflatables have strengths and weaknesses compared to rigid hulled watercraft. A strength is that this can be fit into a large duffel bag and stowed in a trunk rather than requiring a rack. The only weakness of this boat would be the tendency to take on some water between the outer shell and the air chambers. This occurs by way of a nylon fabric seam that isn&rsquo;t water tight. The outer hull is a scuff resistant layer more than a water barrier. Draining isn&rsquo;t difficult but it may take a few days of air drying before long term storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="or-as-comfortable-probably-more-durable">or as Comfortable, probably more durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly not as fast as the Sea Eagle, or as Comfortable, probably more durable, though both have held up well in moderate seas, took them to the Florida Keys, Its also heavier than the Sea Eag, Its really heavy duty if thats what your looking for, hmm mph</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-ride">nice ride</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I could&rsquo;nt find anything wrong with it, it inflates easy and has a nice ride for 2 people. A very good buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-of-the-main-tubes-has-a-small-section-defect">One of the main tubes has a small section defect &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the main tubes has a small section defect and will not inflate. The tube defect would cause a hinge point and the kayak would not function right and could be dangerous.</p>

<h5 id="best-inflatable-buy-on-www-airhead-kayak">Best Inflatable Buy on WWW Airhead Kayak?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kayak is as advertised and reviewed by other 5 star reviews. It is rugged compared to Sevelor and other manufacturers. It is well equipped with D rings and carry handles.</p>
