<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="what-a-terrific-light">What a terrific light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a home inspector. Attics tend to be one of the areas where I need a good light because most of them are poorly lit and often have no floors so the reach and brightness of the flashlight are very important. This light turns the attic into daylight. I can see the farthest corners of any attic and have confidence that I can report accurate information to my client. Twenty years ago, the old D-cell Maglight was the light all inspectors carried. It was heavy, not very bright, difficult to focus and an all round joke (though you could fend off an attacker with it). The Supernova is simply the best flashlight I have ever used and I&rsquo;m very happy with this purchase. To add to this, the company offers excellent support, unlike anything I&rsquo;ve encountered in seven decades of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product especially for the price. Been using it for a few weeks in the LE business. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a rechargeable light to mount on my patrol rifle. I bought this one since I can remove the battery and charge it without having to dismount the entire light. Just unscrew the tail cap, remove the battery and charge it. Before mounting it on my rifle I was using the light at my desk with a computer wiring problem. I had the three AAA batteries that came with the light installed since the rechargeable battery was charging. I was using the light on the brightest setting when I had to leave my desk suddenly and forgot to turn the light off. When I came back over three hours later the light was still shining as bright as it was when I left. Its been dropped a few times and still works like new. Good buy so far!!</p>

<h5 id="some-things-to-consider">Some things to consider&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been researching flashlights for a year now; to find the best gift for my Dad on this years father&rsquo;s day. I decided to place my hopes in the Supernova Guardian 1300TL.Things I liked:-The shipping time was great, provided by Amazon Prime.-The kit that the flashlight comes in looks great in terms of visuals and design, and is also gift friendly.- Both Lithium rechargeable batteries were already at full charge right out of the box.-I could tell the Guardian was hand tested for quality prior to shipping.-The kit comes with a unique instructions manual. It not only explains how to use your Supernova in great detail, but the creators answers the FAQs with a sense of confidence that their product is the best.-The Guardian is very well built in terms of Durability and Function.-It can operate on either 3 triple A batteries (with the included converter) or ONE 18650 Lithium Battery (Comes with 2 total).-Although the actual output of Lumens may be questionable, it is still far greater than 90% of other flashlights in its class.-The battery (and circuitry) is efficient enough to give a steady, full strength output for 4 hours(on high beam)(100% to 10% of battery) before switching to a Energy Saver mode which allows the flashlight to be used for another 4-5 hours (low beam)(10% to 0% battery). <em>tested myself</em>-The light switch is made of a luminescent soft rubber which allows you to find it in the dark due to a dim glow. The rubber also allows for slip-resistant operator while outside.-The (Lumen output/size of flashlight) is extremely high. Meaning this is smaller than most of regular flashlights, yet packs a walloping punch of light.Things I didn&rsquo;t like:Pricing: I was a bit iffy on buying it when it was $79.99, but I did anyway. Two days after I bought it (now), I received it and was happy enough to write my first review ever on a product (this one). I got on&hellip; and find out that they&rsquo;re NOW doing a sale for it for only $59.97. I feel a little cheated, but its my own fault for father&rsquo;s day shopping too early.Warranty: In the confident instruction&rsquo;s manual, there is a section in there where it boasts about the flashlight &ldquo;lasting for life&rdquo;. And if anything was ever to go wrong, the lifetime warranty would &ldquo;be around to support you and fix or replace it&rdquo;. They listed their Warranty website as [&hellip;]. I was happy and ready to sign up for the warranty, but as I entered in the website&hellip; a 404 message saying the website &ldquo;does not exist&rdquo;.Nevertheless, a great flashlight and I would recommend it to others. I just wish everything was a bit more stable.-Honest review</p>

<h5 id="i-now-love-this-flashlight">I now love this flashlight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated review. My original review is below. I am updating it because the company took the initiative to reach out to me and not only replaced the damaged flash, but gave me an additional one. That is outstanding customer service!I gave the other flashlight to my employee. Since then, we have not had any issues with these lights, and we use them daily. They do take a long time to charge (hours) but once they are charged they are incredibly bright and the battery lasts a long time. Overall we are now very satisfied with the quality, aside from the first one that I mention in my original review below. We will continue to work them hard and report any issues.I&rsquo;m a home inspector. I wanted to love this flashlight. Its one of the brightest on the market and fairly small in size. However it is extremely fragile. I bought two of them. I dropped one and the led cover broke inside the lens. I dropped the other flashlight one time and it stopped working completely. I use a flashlight daily and have never had such a fragile model. I am often holding an android tablet, a camera and my flashlight, while inspecting or climbing, so things occasionally drop. I would expect a drop not to kill an item immediately. I&rsquo;m going to contact the seller and will update this once I see how their customer service responds. Seriously, I paid way too much for these flashes for one drop to break each of them.</p>
