<p>Truly Wireless In-ear Headphones The VAVA MOOV 20 feature a truly cordless design that won&rsquo;t tangle or hold you back. Experience enhanced mobility and enjoy untangled music with an innovative build that has no wires to speak of.Ultra-Snug Patented Eartip DesignBenefit from the VAVA branded, unique in-ear soft gel design that adjusts to the ear for listening to your music for longer while staying comfortable. These headphones feature a durable sweatproof build and a nano-coated USB port so that they&rsquo;ll work flawlessly in all conditions.Clear Made-For-Life AudioWhether it is for music streaming or hands-free calling, the finely balanced EQ settings will provide a crisp audio quality that delivers all details with style and grace. The advantage of having truly cordless headphones with no wires is that you can choose to wear only one headphone and keep the other ear free to stay aware your surroundings.Added Control With Built-in ButtonsThe VAVA MOOV 20 sport built-in controls that let you pause / play music, skip audio track, adjust the volume, and even reach out to your favorite, personal assistant for some voice prompts.True Wireless Working Principle You Need to KnowThe R earbud get the Bluetooth signal from your device (lose 20% signal on the way) and transmit it to the L earbud（lose 20% again), as a result, the L earbud can get only 60% Bluetooth signal from the original device, that is why all the true wireless earbuds on the market always have the same problem of connection on the left earbud.Battery Of The True Wireless HeadphonesBecasue of the small size of the headphone itself, the big battery in such small body is obviously unreasonable. Nevertheless, these headphones still can maintain 3 hours of battery life, taking 1 hour to complete the full charge.</p>

<h5 id="a-solid-first-offering-from-vava-in-the-true-wireless-market-if-you-want-tws-earbuds-with-bass-then-these-are-for-you">A solid first offering from VAVA in the true wireless market. If you want TWS earbuds with bass, then these are for you.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> If you are a fan of bass heavy music and you want true wireless earbuds, then the Vava Moov 20&rsquo;s could be the right earbuds for you to purchase. If you are looking for true wireless earbuds that will stay in your ears during a workout (I am speaking from a runner&rsquo;s perspective), then I would probably recommend a different pair of true wireless earbuds. I&rsquo;ve been using these earbuds for around a week now, and here are my thoughts on them so far:Pro&rsquo;s:+ I personally really like the sound quality. They are definitely bass heavy earbuds, but I personally prefer that. Of all of the true wireless earbuds (TWS) that I&rsquo;ve tried out (I&rsquo;ve reviewed a lot of them on my YouTube Channel), these are definitely the most bass heavy.+ They are super comfortable to wear. I can easily wear these for 3+ hours and forget their even there.+ The case they come with is classy and quality. While I would prefer it to be a charging case (like a number of other TWS earbuds), the case is undoubtedly a nice one.+ The connection process is super simple. If you have any trouble check out my video.Cons:- The battery life, like many other TWS earbuds is lacking. 3 hours is pretty much standard operating procedure for many of them, but I&rsquo;d like to see more TWS earbuds that get closer to 5 or 6 hours of battery.- They have to be plugged in a dual micro usb for charging, so don&rsquo;t lose that cable.- These will not stay in my ears if I&rsquo;m working out. They would be fine for weight lifting, but any sort of running or similar movements will cause them to fall out of my ears. Check out my reviews on my YouTube Channel (in my profile) if you want TWS earbuds that are good for working out with (specifically running).</p>

<h5 id="and-stay-in-just-fine-when-out-on-a-walk">and stay in just fine when out on a walk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these a couple of weeks ago and have used them several times since then. My expectations for these were really low, and I just assumed I&rsquo;d be returning them either for fit or function. However, they paired up quickly and correctly with my iPhone and have not caused any problems since then. They fit in my ears very well, and stay in just fine when out on a walk. They may well stay in during a run too. The sound is just fine for Audiobooks and pretty good for music. I haven&rsquo;t hit the battery life limit yet, but even just the advertised three hours is worth it for the compact size and light weight of these. If you&rsquo;re curious about whether these are worth the price, I think they are. I&rsquo;m sure a year from now we can get better versions of these even cheaper, but for now, I think these are well worth it and I&rsquo;m glad that I purchased them; I would purchase them again for sure.</p>

<h5 id="exceeded-original-expectations-greatly-with-sound-and-convenience-from-vava">Exceeded Original Expectations Greatly with Sound and Convenience from VAVA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These true wireless earbuds from VAVA boast quality sound, design, and controls. For those who are not familiar with the technology, true wireless earbuds are simply two separate earbuds that create stereo sound but do not have any physical connection. Since there is no physical connection between the earbuds, it is much more freeing to use true wireless earbuds rather than traditional Bluetooth earbuds for working out. This is because most people using Bluetooth for getting rid of the annoying, bouncy, cable, but most Bluetooth headphones still have some sort of cable which still can bother you while running or cycling.At first, I was a bit hesitant in this purchase because of the mixed reviews, and was preparing myself for the worst. However, I am very happy I made the decision to purchase these earbuds. I was concerned about the fit, as there are no ear hooks provided. By twisting the earbud into my ear, I found that you actually can get a secure fit for walking, although I would not recommend these for running or cross-fit.These earbuds are also inconspicuous and have an attractive design. The black finish with the VAVA logo makes the earbuds stylish and fashionable, which is a perfect look for both exercise and office or formal use. The VAVA branded unique in-ear soft gel design for the ear tips makes them comfortable to wear for long periods of time.The sound quality on these is also much better than expected. Although I would have preferred a bit more bass, especially for running, the audio is clear with a wide range of sounds. The connectivity is not the best, but considering the convenience of having no wires, the rare cut-out of the left earbud is completely expected and acceptable.The battery life is about three hours of continuous music playback and phone calls. This is also decent for the true wireless earbuds category. I do wish the included case doubled as a charging case. However, I do like the look of the case as it is elegant and well-designed, compared to other cheaper plastic cases.Overall, I would definitely recommend giving these a try!</p>

<h5 id="recommended-if-they-suit-your-situation">Recommended if they suit your situation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had no issues with pairing, the sound quality was awesome. I am not sure I can use while jogging, but in a standard office envt, yes. These do not draw attention, unless you notice sideways, they blink. They may not be suited for all ears, as they don&rsquo;t fit as snug with my spouse&rsquo;s ears.You need to be less cautious and think that they may fall off anytime, that interferes with your enjoyment. You can wear these for conference calls where you can choose wearing just one. Also if you want to be discreet and share the songs you are listening with someone..you can do it well with these&hellip;without having to disturb anyone around(especially kids). Like my spouse played something and gave me a earbud to listen to&hellip;if I liked and asked me to guess something about the song!. I am thinking that spontaneity was not something we did earlier with toddlers in tow!</p>
