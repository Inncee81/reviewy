<p>Please Note for BenQ 3D Projectors only we recommend Adult DLP LINK eD Elite 144 Hz 3D Glasses (eDimensional Active Rechargeable) for All 3D DLP Projectors. As certain newer BenQ 3D Projectors are putting off too strong of a signal. You can still use the 3DHeaven version DLP Link 3D glasses if you put a piece of scotch tape across part of the receiver on the front of the 3DHeaven version DLP Link 3D glasses. Thanks for Looking!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving this review to compare the SainSonic SSZ-200DLB with the Ultra-Clear HD DLP LINK 3D Glasses. I&rsquo;m using them with an Acer H5380BD Projector on a 115&rdquo; diagonal screen. They both work great! Below I will list, what I think, are some pros and cons of each. I needed three pairs so I thought it would be good to try two different brands. I read good reviews on both and what I read was accurate.Ultra-Clear HD DLP LINK 3DPros:Good image and colorFit very wellCharged up very quicklyThey sync automaticallyHave a nice rubberized finishCons:Make the image sightly darker than SainsonicUSB port cover is tricky to openSainSonic SSZ-200DLBPros:Very good image and colorsLightweightCons:Need to swap left and right syncingThey are a little long and may stick out behind your head and move when you lean your head back in your seatThey are both nice glasses, the 3D is great on both. I personally like the rubberized finish on the Ultra-Clears. Plus the fact that they sync automatically, even when you leave the room then come back. The SainSonics don&rsquo;t darken the image as much but also don&rsquo;t sync automatically, which may be an issue for children or technically challenged. Its easy to swap left for right, one quick button press, only that some viewers may not spot the difference. The field of view on the SainSonics is slightly larger than the UCs, but its the difference between seeing four feet on either side of the screen vs eight feet on either side. None of my screen gets cut off with either pair. I have not had them long enough to see which one holds a charge longer but I don&rsquo;t foresee that as being a problem if I just keep them charged on a regular basis. And its recommended to charge them between long periods of storage.I&rsquo;m watching content on a PS3 for 3D Blu-Rays and Netflix. If you have Netflix, watch &ldquo;Art of Flight&rdquo;, a good film in 2D made even more immersive in 3D. Also, my cable company offers a handful of 3D movies on HBO On-Demand.For children and guests I recommend Ultra-Clear as they are smaller and simpler to use. If, on the other hand, your projector isn&rsquo;t super bright, I&rsquo;d go with The SainSonics.</p>

<h5 id="the-picture-through-these-is-also-amazing-my-husband-thinks-they-are-a-little-heavy">The picture through these is also amazing. My husband thinks they are a little heavy &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these for our Optoma projector because with the DLP link they are to link seamlessly to our projector. We also received another brand that for Christmas that did not have the dlp direct link so those need to be paired with the projector. We tested both sets with the projector and these were hands down faster. They connected instantly. We tried for several minutes on the others and had difficulties getting them to pair up. The picture through these is also amazing. My husband thinks they are a little heavy but he also wears these over his glasses. I don&rsquo;t wear glasses and I do not think they are heavy. We liked them so much we ordered 4 more pairs. Definitely recommend.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-glasses-recommend">Very nice glasses! RECOMMEND!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are very nice. They produce a crisp image with a 3d &lsquo;pop&rsquo; that will surprise you. I bought these at the same time as the Elephas 3d Glasses and can say that both are excellent choices. Both keep a charge for an extended time, both produce clear images and are comfortable, but there are a few differences:Pro&rsquo;sThese look more modern so the kids like them more.These may fit on kids faces better based on the fact that they like them more.Con&rsquo;sSlightly darker image than the ElephasThat takes some explanation. The Elephas has a slightly tan shift to the lenses that keeps them looking bright whereasâ€‹ the 3dHeaven keep a more correct color tone but lose just a bit of brightness.I don&rsquo;t think you should have just one type of glasses in your home theater anyway so I recommend you try several. What I know is that I recommend these, and would buy them again. At the same time, the Elephas are cheaper right now, and although they may not look as cool, could be a good addition to your theater as well.All-in-all, kudos to 3dheaven for making a nice pair of glasses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure they work ok with some projectors, but they do not work with the BenQ HT3050.They lose sync constantly. I have tried 3 pairs and all the same. I tried these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EIIYLT6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1and">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EIIYLT6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1and</a> they work perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="great-glasses-great-price">Great Glasses, Great Price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been apprehensive about buying 3D glasses for my new DLP projector. I had read a lot of reviews of people having issues or dropping DLP for RF glasses and ultimately I was unsure what to do. Thanks to Black Friday deals I decided to take a risk and purchased these glasses. I am glad I did.I was very pleased with their size as they easily fit over my prescription classes and, at the same time, were very comfortable. Although it did take me a minute to figure out how to open the charging protecting cover, I was impressed with how fast they charged. When I tested them with my first 3D movie, Avatar, they quickly powered on and relayed a beautiful 3D image.If you are in the market for 3D glasses for the DLP system I highly recommend these. I ended up ordering 2 more pair. Quality and price can&rsquo;t be beat!</p>

<h5 id="worst-3d-glasses-i-ve-ever-seen">Worst 3D glasses I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The glasses are absolute garbage. I bought them to use with my new BenQ projector, and they are the worst 3D glasses I&rsquo;ve ever seen&hellip; which is saying a lot given that I produce 3D content and have used a wide variety of glasses, both active and passive. When used with my projection system, these dim the image to about 1/3rd of it&rsquo;s original brightness&hellip; it&rsquo;s like looking through dark sunglasses in a theater. It completely ruins the viewing experience, making the image both very dark and desaturated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ever-so-much-better-than-i-expected">Ever so much better than I expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these to go with this thing:Â Optoma HD141X 1080p 3D DLP Home Theater ProjectorThey worked ever so well. Way beyond my expectations. While it was my first home-theater 3d experience, it was awesome.Worked well with video games, too. I think I&rsquo;m ruined for non-3d 3d games.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-great-glasses">Great, great glasses!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great, great glasses! The only ones I&rsquo;ve ever bought, but they perform flawlessly. My friends are amazed. I&rsquo;m using them with a BenQ HT2050 projector. These charge quickly and are comfortable to wear.</p>
