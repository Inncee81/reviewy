<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="1-pro-2-cons">1 Pro 2 cons</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: It seems very well constructed and with good quality materials, looks that will last for a long time.Cons: It didn&rsquo;t come with the screws to fasten it to the box in the wall, The cable is longer than needed and HDMI connector is bulky, could not fit inside the box once connected to the source HDMI and had to pull the cable thru one of the box orifices and connect it outside and leave it exposed. Keep this in mind if you have more wires in the same box.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-but-installation-is-not-as-described-the">Works well but installation is not as described, The &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well but installation is not as described, The instructions indicate you should remove the cover plate and use it as a template and carefully cut the drywall to match the inner area. This will not work.The device is designed to be used with an electrical box. Since I did not wish to fuss with an electrical box in existing construction, I made a hole in the drywall just big enough for the end of the HDMI cord. I removed the cover plate, connected the HDMI cord and installed it using two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch butterfly type wall anchors. I then attached the cover plate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-product-looks-to-be-of-sound-construction-and-the-price-point-is-right">The product looks to be of sound construction and the price point is right.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually thought I was ordering the &ldquo;old model screw back connector&rdquo;. I had plans to use the older model. The newer model is useless to me. That is my fault though. I&rsquo;ll probably be keeping it because it was so inexpensive and I&rsquo;ll find some use for it. The product looks to be of sound construction and the price point is right. The reason for the three stars? According to Amazon, three stars means &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK&rdquo;. Well&hellip;it&rsquo;s ok.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The plate does not fit the electrical box properly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-for-retro-fit-in-an-rv">Worked great for retro-fit in an RV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The jack will either attach directly to the box, or it can attach to the wall in a flush installation with simply a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; hole. Worked great for retro-fit in an RV!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-slick-cables-fit-in-nice-and-snug">Pretty slick. Cables fit in nice and snug</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To answer my own question, these work with a gang box, though it&rsquo;s not required. Pretty slick. Cables fit in nice and snug, so it&rsquo;s unlikely they&rsquo;ll ever slip out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-like-it-should">Works like it should</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Follow the simple enclosed installation directions and you will have a professional looking and functioning HDMI port. The frame inserts snuglyinto the drywall cutout and locks into place. The attached pigtail (short HDMI cords) provide a solid connection from your source to a flat screenTV, Blu Ray, receiver, etc. The sturdy wall plate completes the install with a clean professional finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived on time. Exactly as described. Would buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-price-range">Excellent price range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is exactly what I needed to finish my project. Excellent price range, quality and service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="esay-install-works-great-for-home-theater">Esay Install, Works great for home theater.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great easy install, good packaging. really needed the extra cable length at the back of the plate since one of my cords was a little short. This gave me the extra I needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great idea</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was just what I needed to put my HDMI cables in the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="where-s-the-screws">Where&rsquo;s the Screws??</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be nice if you would include the SCREWS to attach this to the electrical box.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-company">Great company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product and the company responds quickly to any concerns or problems and makes it right</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-but-causing-interference-in-the-signal-to">Easy to install but causing interference in the signal to &hellip;</h5>
