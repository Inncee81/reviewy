<p>From the Manufacturer
Slim. Stylish. Simple.</p>

<p>For those wanting a simple way to capture moments with family, friends and more, the slim, stylish PowerShot ELPH 180 camera has easy-to-use features to help create photos that are as stunning as you want. The 8x Optical Zoom lets you get close to the action, while the 20.0 Megapixel* CCD sensor with DIGIC 4+ Image Processor help produce vibrant, clear images to share or print. Take more than just still images, with the ability to record movies at 720p HD. For added convenience, Smart AUTO figures out suitable settings for what you&rsquo;re photographing so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about finding a picture mode yourself. To help reduce the effects of camera shake, Digital IS helps keep blur to a minimum. On top of that, the Auto Zoom feature can automatically close in on your subject and keep it in focus for easy shooting.</p>

<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>8x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer helps you capture images with flexibility and ease</p>

<p>The PowerShot ELPH 180 camera features an 8x Optical Zoom so more shots are within your reach. You&rsquo;ll love the flexibility that the wide 28–224mm (35mm equivalent) shooting range offers. Plus, the wide-angle lens captures an expansive image in each shot, adding depth, perspective and grandeur. Landscapes, city scenes, family shots and more benefit from the extra width. Whether you&rsquo;re shooting wide group shots or zooming to the telephoto end, your images will be bright and clear.</p>

<p>20.0 Megapixel* CCD sensor combines with the DIGIC 4+ Image Processor to help deliver stunning image quality
20.0 Megapixel* Sensor
With the PowerShot ELPH 180 camera&rsquo;s 20.0 Megapixels* of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the 8x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution can be ideal for creating large prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity.</p>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The PowerShot ELPH 180 camera&rsquo;s DIGIC 4+ Image Processor features accelerated processing speed to create fast, responsive performance, giving you a shooting experience that&rsquo;s easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by up to 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This helps significantly reduce noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor&rsquo;s highly efficient design also extends battery life.</p>

<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>

<p>Capture 720p HD video</p>

<p>Using the slim PowerShot ELPH 180 camera, you can shoot high-definition video when you want, where you want. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you&rsquo;ll be able to quickly record moments in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories.</p>

<p>Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings based on predefined shooting situations</p>

<p>Click here for a larger image
Getting that great shot can be as simple as pressing the shutter button on the PowerShot ELPH 180 camera. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject and analyzes them using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to help facilitate incredible image capture, whether you&rsquo;re shooting stills or video. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<p>Digital IS helps reduce the effect of camera shake and subject movement
Sometimes even the steadiest of hands can move a little, and during night photos or when zoomed in close, even a small shudder can blur a photo. Digital IS on the PowerShot ELPH 180 camera analyzes the image in order to electronically remove blur and fuzzy edges, helping to ensure you get a clear picture.</p>

<p>Scene Modes such as Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect and Monochrome provide creative freedom to capture your photos
The PowerShot ELPH 180 camera provides shooting modes that can easily give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters. You can make a quirky portrait using the Fisheye Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as if capturing the photo using a “toy” or pinhole camera.
Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.
Portrait    Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background.
Face Self-timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter.
Low Light   For high-quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Fisheye Effect  Now you can get the fisheye effect – a classic photographic distortion – without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect    Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with “toy” or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects Black-and-White, Sepia or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Fireworks   Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.
Movie   Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.
Actual results may vary from examples shown above.
Final image may vary depending on picture composition.</p>

<p>Enable the Auto Zoom feature and your camera will automatically zoom in to help frame your subject and help keep it in focus
Now, beautifully framed shots using the powerful 8x Optical Zoom are as easy as pressing the Auto Zoom button. With Auto Zoom, the camera automatically determines the correct size and framing by detecting the number of subjects. The system also detects faces that are too small, then zooms in to the proper length. Auto Zoom is a great feature for spontaneous everyday shooting, and especially useful for times when someone else (even a child) is using your camera, for instance at a tourist spot.</p>

<p>ECO Mode helps reduce power consumption for longer battery life
The PowerShot ELPH 180 camera features ECO Mode to help provide a high number of shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. The mode can be activated via a dedicated button for easy power preservation when you are out for the day or the moment is too important to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won&rsquo;t miss the moment.</p>

<p>Help Button provides simple explanations and easy control of your settings
The PowerShot ELPH 180 camera is designed to be fun and easy to use, even for beginners. A Help Button on the camera&rsquo;s exterior brings up the help menu when you need it, right on the LCD screen. From here, you can scroll through a variety of topics that answer your questions with clear explanations, offer helpful shooting advice and show you diagrams highlighting the position of any buttons you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> I do professional photography for a living but wanted a small pocket camera for hiking/traveling/walking and quick things around the house without dragging out a bunch of equipment. It fits in a pocket perfectly! I don&rsquo;t know about you but if I take my pro gear out on a walking, I never actually get any exercise, I just stand around taking photos in one or two spots the whole time. Lol. So — my view on this is it&rsquo;s not as good as previous point-n-shoots I&rsquo;ve had. They used to be heavier, more sturdy, better made and less expensive. This one is lighter, tad flimsy, pricier than I&rsquo;m used to (for the low quality) and not as good made. Comes with a rechargeable battery which is nice but I don&rsquo;t love it enough to buy a backup, although it does last a very long time, charged it for the first time after 2 months of use which is about 10mins every 3 days or so. Quality is so-so and many of the basic features and settings I&rsquo;m used to on most other point-n-shoots are not on this camera or very limited. An amateur can take good shots with it but only if you have the patience on the focusing. It can take a long time for it to focus on what you are trying for. For example, say you are trying to get a butterfly on a flower, it may continuously want to focus on the ground rather than the flower/butterfly area (see photo of what I mean or looks like Amazon isn&rsquo;t allowing all my photos so not sure if you can see it). It does AMAZING macro shots most of the time though, it automatically focuses them (best without flash on) but other shots farther away or if trying to do something quick not as great, so give it time to focus. Not the worse quality shots ever but not best either. A tiny bit muddy/painted look if you zoom into the images at 100% (see photo of 100%). The video (one attached) is decent, actually does better than photo stills. It also does not turn off ALL sounds. The settings allow you to turn off many sounds but it keeps the shutter sound, beeps when focusing and there is no way to turn it off. Personally, I don&rsquo;t like the sounds. If I had to choose a pocket camera for hiking and traveling again, I would save a little more and not get this one. If I only wanted to take quick macros inside for products etc, this is the camera to have. I&rsquo;ve attached 19 photos and 1 video straight from this camera without Ps edits. ~Happy Shooting~</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.Canon includes a &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera&rsquo;s maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job Canon.Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use.</p>

<h5 id="will-not-focus">Will not Focus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I started having focus problems with this camera early on. For a while, if I turned the camera on and off, I could get it to focus. It is now permanently out of focus. The camera has never been dropped, gotten wet or had any sort of damage. This is simply a defect that is inherent in the camera. I will not buy any more Canon cameras.</p>
