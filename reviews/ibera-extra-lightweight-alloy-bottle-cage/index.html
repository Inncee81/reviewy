</ul>

<p>The ultra thin and sleek bottle cage is the lightest of Ibera&rsquo;s bottle cages, weighing only 29g, constructed from lightweight heat-treated aluminum alloy. Other bottle cages usually weigh from 40g to 70g. The bottle cage is light, but still has the strength of a regular bottle cage. The oval and ergonomic design helps to strengthen its hold, keeping bottles securely in place while providing easy access for riders. Great for rides around town or for touring. At only 29 grams, it is perfect for those who want a stylish cage to lighten their load as they ride. 2 glossy finishes in a carbon pattern and white and 2 matte finishes in black and silver make it easy to match bikes of all colors. Specifications: Material: Heat-treated aluminum plate. Weight: 29 g (1 oz.). Dimensions: 4.5&rdquo; x 3&rdquo; x 3.5&rdquo;. Note: Not for rough or off-road riding.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="carbon-look-feel-at-an-alloy-price">Carbon Look &amp; Feel at an alloy price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the &ldquo;Carbon Looking&rdquo; cage, i was skeptical because i generally like to only have authentic materials on my bike, but at this price i decided to take a chance.They did a superb job detailing this cage, only you (and of course people who have the same thing!) will know that this product is not actually carbon fiber. The material looks identical to the real carbon fiber cages I have on my trek hybrid, the only way i can tell is if i put the real ones right next to this product, this product is slightly more glossy than my authentic ones, but if there is nothing to compare to at close range, it is very difficult to notice.It also functions great, holds either my two insulated polar bottles or the two insulated camelback bottles snugly, the polars are more snug than the camelbacks, but i cannot imagine the camelbacks falling out.the packaging says not for use off-road, but i bought them for my gt avalanche frame so that&rsquo;s all that bike is for is off road and the bottles have never come loose, so i would not let that discourage you.for the record i am a product designer and this is an exceptionally well designed product, my two favorite designs that most people would not notice are the high quality rubberized red joint you can see to keep the underlying alloy in shape, and the chamfered edges around the rim of the cage to allow for you to blindly insert your desired bottle easily with out having to look down!I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great looking, highly functional, affordable cage!</p>

<h5 id="look-great-and-light-but-finish-is-not-durable">look great and light, but finish is NOT durable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two of these, carbon paint pattern, for my carbon fiber Ridley x-fire bike (a cyclocross bike, but I only ride it on the road with bottles; when doing cross, I don&rsquo;t carry water bottles). I ride my bike in nice weather conditions mainly, only rarely getting caught in the rain; I don&rsquo;t commute with it.I love the finish, the red accents on carbon fiber look is very nice. I use camelback podium bottles, which fit nicely. Have no problems putting them in or out, and have probably about 1500 miles with them now (about 9 months of use). They are very light.The only issue I am having is that the paint does come off where the bottle rubs the holder with repeated use at contact points, leaving bare metal. It has not rusted, it is alloy so hopefully it won&rsquo;t. It is minor, and I am still using them, but if you are particular you might consider looking elsewhere. See the pics I posted.I have not had problems with the durability of the aluminum itself (two other reviews mentioned the bottom piece bending/breaking over time), probably because I only set my podium bottles in gently, and don&rsquo;t push them to the bottom (makes them easier to pop in and out while riding). So YMMV depending on usage style.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-bottle-cage-even-for-25oz-bottles">Excellent Bottle Cage Even for 25oz Bottles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using these bottle cages (2) on my Niner RLT 9 for several months now, often times with Camelbak Big Chill 25oz bottles. I mention the bottles because these are longer than your after bike bottle, but the retention on these cages is fantastic. Lightweight is also an appropriate description. I weighed them when I first got them and it saved me about 10g over my usual cages (actual weight escapes me right now). I was also very pleased with the aesthetics. Not only are these nicely shaped, but the white and red compliments the white and red portions of my bike, making them look like they were designed for the RLT 9. I definitely recommend this bottle cage!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-and-stylish">Sturdy and stylish</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband bought a bike last year and for Valentine&rsquo;s day I wanted to be able to provide him with as many of the accessories he would need as I could. I came across this water bottle cage and fell in love! The color scheme was exactly what I was looking for to match his bike, and it looked very stylish.I was pleased when it came in to see that it looked exactly as advertised, colors and all. The carbon fiber pattern looks really fantastic. My husband has had this cage on his bike for a year now and usually puts a 20oz polar water bottle in it while riding. It holds the bottle perfectly, and the cage has yet to scuff or scratch. He loves this cage so much that he actually had me buy a second one this year so he could have a match set for long rides.For the price point you pay for this product you are getting quality and style that will fit all your needs. I am confident that these cages will last the life of the bike.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-out-well-with-my-frame">Worked out well with my frame.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Ibera bottle cages for my road bike. While not carbon fiber, they are cost effective and relatively light weight. My favorite &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is the little metal tab at the bottom of the cage (that supports the bottom of the water bottle). My Trek frame&rsquo;s mounting holes are a bit too close to the top tube for oversized Camelbak water bottles (the 25 oz size). Since the tabs are metal, I was able to slightly bend them making enough room for my bottles. The little piece of rubber that holds the outsides of the water bottle cage together in the middle has enough &ldquo;give&rdquo; to allow for easy access to my bottles while riding. If the cage had been carbon fiber or even hard plastic, they would not have worked as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-and-unreliable-broke-after-a-year-of-regular-use">Cheap and unreliable - broke after a year of regular use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had two of these bottle cages on my road bike for about a year. The good - they look really nice and initially held bidons firmly. Easy to take out bottles and easy to put them back. The bad - cheap aluminium construction resulted in two failures. First, back plate of the cage cracked and the cage was rattling against the frame. Second, bottom lip bent (on both cages) and eventually broke off. In the process I lost my favorite bidon. I only carry small 500ml bottles so weight of the full bottle was not an issue. You would only buy these if you ready to replace them regularly or if you do not use them often.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-very-minimal-and-doesn-t-offer-a-lot-of-support-to-the-water-bottle-itself">It&rsquo;s very minimal and doesn&rsquo;t offer a lot of support to the water bottle itself.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will say this water bottle holder is for a RACE type bike or athelete. It&rsquo;s very minimal and doesn&rsquo;t offer a lot of support to the water bottle itself. I don&rsquo;t think a few extra grams will make any difference since your putting a full bottle on the bike anyway. The carbon fiber is fake and just a decal. I would probably get a different holder next time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Light, and fits my bike well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-cages">Love these cages</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these cages! They looked so good, and worked so well on my bike, I had to order a set for my son&rsquo;s bike! He loves them, too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-light-but">They are light, but&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these to mount behind the seat. They are really light, but they also bend like aluminum foil.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Poor quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-option">Great value option!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value, the alloy is flexible and allows me to make them tighter for certain bottles. They work pretty well mounted vertically behind the seat too, I&rsquo;ve gone about 200 miles&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-and-lightweight">Nice and lightweight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice and lightweight, hoever comes at a cost. The aluminum tab at the bottom has broken off 2 of my cages. Nothing like riding down the road and your bottles come out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-texture-and-style">Love the texture and style</h5>

<p>Very lightweight yet durable. Love the texture and style.</p>
