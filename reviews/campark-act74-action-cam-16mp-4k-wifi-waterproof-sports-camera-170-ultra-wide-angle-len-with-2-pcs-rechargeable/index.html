<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="small-and-powerful-happy-with-videos-and-stills">Small and Powerful - Happy with videos and stills</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered a different camera earlier this week for our upcoming vacation and was really disappointed with the quality. So I spent some time reviewing the other cameras on Amazon and decided to give it a chance. (It had some other great reviews on some photo sites.)It was delivered the next day and I immediately began testing it out.Key Learnings1. Set up is pretty straight forward. Was up and running in minutes.2. Tried both under water shots and above water shots with the waterproof case. WOW! Great photos and videos. My iPhone is my normal go to camera, but now I am going to be reaching for this guy anytime we are near water! I attached a few shots.3. Love the accessories and the bag. Will be good for taking on trips.4. Mobile App - downloaded the mobile App but had no luck connecting it to my camera. Was bummed that I couldn&rsquo;t get that up and running, but will continue to try soon and will update my review. The App isn&rsquo;t necessary. But it would have been nice if it worked as expected.All in all, this is a great camera. I am recommending it for people looking for an inexpensive and quality camera that will fit in your pocket.</p>

<h5 id="packs-the-same-functionality-of-a-500-gopro-a-great-product">Packs the same functionality of a $500 GoPro!&ndash;A Great product&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I recently got this &ldquo;&ldquo;knockoff GoPro&rdquo;&rdquo; for $50 and I would say it has been the best $50 I&rsquo;ve spent in a long time.Pros-Great Picture and Video Quality (Up to a crisp 16M[4608x3456] and [4k30fps]-Cool High-Speed Functionality (It can go up to 90fps on 720p, which presents some cool smooth footage when played back at 1.5x Slower (60fps) or 3x Slower (30fps))-Actually lighter than you would expect. It is very light but does not feel cheap. It has a sturdy rigid black plastic body and the waterproof case is also very durable and clear.-A CRAP TON of stuff is included - Tons of different mounts, fittings, an extra battery, cables, microfiber cloth, an instruction booklet, among many other things are packed in a hard-shell carrying case that is surprisingly good quality.-Compact - Even with the case on, this thing is pretty small!-Waterproof case is very tightly sealed, making me believe on the 100ft deep waterproof rating. Very clear lens on it and includes waterproof exterior buttons to let you control the camera even while underwater, in the air, or pretty much anywhere.-Wide angle lens is a spacious 170°-The Slowmo MAY actually record at 120fps because the playback is at 30fps, but the recordings are 4x as long as how long you held down the button, meaning instead of 720p90fps, it is actually recording at 720p120fps. :)Cons-The lens is small enough that getting close enough to some objects will warp the image slightly (Though I would not really consider this much of a con, as all action cams do this!)Troubles I had-When you get the camera and its case, you may think that to open the case, you hold down the sliding tab and pull up from the back side of the black bar (the long part which is on the back of the waterproof case), but to open it you slide the tab and lift from the same side (lift on the same side as the front lens) This actually helps with the waterproofing so it is not a con.-The app doesn&rsquo;t really work for me (at the moment) Every time I open up the app which it says to get, it crashes on me. I have an Iphone 4 (IOS 7.1.2) And the minimum iOS required is 7.1. This might be fixed but for me, the app currently is not working.-Mode switching in order: Video (HD), Picture, Slow motion (Not HD), picture viewer, options/settings. Just letting you know so you don&rsquo;t have to switch settings every time you want to record 4k or slow motion.-Waterproof case comes with an interchangeable back panel which allows sound in. Do not use this one in water or else you are screwed. The one without holes is for the water, not this one included with the camera, but not attached at first. I saw reviews saying that the sound was bad because they could not hear, but clearly they did not use the back panel which lets sound in.In conclusion, I would have to say that if you are thinking about getting an action camera, this is your best bet. You really don&rsquo;t have to look around amazon for a better $50 action cam (I did, but after reading reviews for others, they either not what they were described, or did not come with any accessories.) This camera has everything that you can expect in a much more expensive action cam, such as a GoPro Hero 3+, but for a steal of only $50. I am definitely going to get this as gifts for Birthdays and Christmas, along with recommending it to other people. A great product.I was not provided with a sample of the product or discounted in any way by Campark to create this review, I just felt not fair with the previous reviews left with this camera. :)Hope this helped!</p>

<h5 id="good-camera-for-the-price">Good camera for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good camera for the price, but much of the frame where the image looks more like blended paint splotches than crisp &ldquo;4k&rdquo; video. Sensor isn&rsquo;t great, but you can at least see what is going on some spots more than others. It isn&rsquo;t a deal breaker, but definitely something I would consider if you are looking for a high-quality camera for videos to share. I was looking or something that would have better quality, but this camera is definitely something I would recommend for those who just want an instant replay of their last ski jump or other tricks. The wifi connection, however, was seamless. Even while recording &ldquo;1080&rdquo; video at 60fps, there was almost no latency whatsoever. Overall, wifi works great, but I am not overly impressed with the video quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-deal-on-excellent-camera">Great deal on Excellent Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great camera for a great price. It comes with a large slew of mounting accessories that look compatible with the GoPro ones. There&rsquo;s many video and picture formats and options to get the size and quality just right. To use it I did have to buy a micro-SD card. I got a 32Gb, but it depends on how much video you will be doing before you can unload. All the buttons work great, even with the waterproof housing. Sound does not travel very well with the waterproof housing, but there is another housing that has slits that let the sound in/out better (obviously not for underwater use).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-action-camera-without-breaking-the-bank">Good action camera without breaking the bank.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great camera for the money. If you are in the market for an action camera but don&rsquo;t want to spring for the cost of a GoPro, this might just be the ticket. So far the waterproof case has kept the camera working in heavy thunderstorms. The case feels very well made with tight sealing gaskets and strong locking cams.The zippered soft case is a nice touch as well with its cut foam interior keeping the contents from shifting around. The mounts that come with the device allow you to attach it to almost any surface or item. While the automatic white balance leaves a little to be desired, the camera has manual color temp options. Wifi functionality is pretty useful as you can easily mount this on the exterior of a vehicle and control it from the interior. The menu feels more intuitive and easier to use than the GoPro Hero series. I&rsquo;ll probably use this for everything from shooting sports to scuba diving in the near future.</p>
