<ul>
<li>NO EMITTER REQUIRED: DLP link technology syncs directly with a white (or sometimes red) flash that is emitted from the bulb and reflected onto the screen. The flash is imperceptible to the human eye making these glasses ideal for your home cinema without the need for additional emitters or sync mechanisms</li>
<li>WORKS WITH ALL DLP LINK 3D PROJECTORS AND DLP LINK 3DTVS: Nearly every 3D projector today uses DLP link technology making these glasses ideal! Legacy TVs from Samsung and Mitsubishi also use DLP link technology (Samsung manufactured DLP link compatible 3D ready TVs from 2005-2009 or Mitsubishi DLP TVs 2005-2015)</li>
<li>IMPROVED DESIGN AND CRYSTAL CLEAR LENSES: The removable nose pad and optionally removable frames allow for maximum comfort for various face sizes and those who wear prescription glasses! The crystal clear lenses create the most vivid 3D experience you&rsquo;ll find!</li>
<li>LIGHTWEIGHT LOW COST: These glasses are easy on the eyes, nose and face and even easier on the wallet! Don&rsquo;t sacrifice quality for cost! These glasses get you the best of both worlds and can be worn for hours without any discomfort!</li>
<li>UNMATCHED CUSTOMER SUPPORT: We are a family owned U.S. based company. Unlike the competition, 3D is our passion and our business. We offer unmatched technical and customer support! We insure 100% customer satisfaction We also offer a full 1 year hassle free warranty (we simply replace your glasses if anything goes wrong within 1 year)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="the-best-3d-glasses-from-all-available-for-my-ben-q-projector">The BEST 3D glasses from all available for my BEN Q projector.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried pretty much all available glasses for my BenQ projector and this one takes the top spot currently!They are VERY comfortable first of all but fit tightly without movement which is important to me.The power button also works as an inverse option in case your 3D movie is looking odd, push the button once and it will invert the 3D effect. Very cool feature!The charging port is the common USB you use for your cellphones&hellip;no more weird proprietary or rare port! Great change!Unlike the Estar 601 (my previous favorite after modifications) or the previous Firestorm edition (and the BenQ glasses for that matter), there are NO reflections on the glass from your face on this one. This is HUGE because those reflections cut on the contrast and make things look hazy.I had to modified the ESTARs before adding pieces of cloth all around to complete seal them from the outside.I did not detect any Ghosting on this one unlike the previous version so its a BIG improvement in that regards too.The only downside to me is not having a side &ldquo;cover&rdquo; like the previous gen and I wish the glass was a bit bigger because I sit 12&rsquo; from a 12&rsquo; wide screen so it almost didn&rsquo;t fit ..but I don&rsquo;t think such setup is common so I can understand the choices.I also noticed there is a slight color change from wearing the glasses&hellip;seems like its cutting on the red a bit more than the others but not a big problem to adjust that. Much easier than getting rid of reflections on the others.This is better than any other glasses right now including their other versions.My rating is 4.5 stars but I gave it 5 since there is no .5 option.Overall, no is not perfect but in its stock configuration this IS the best option on the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="more-to-be-desired-from-seller-and-design">More to be desired from seller and design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I went to the higher version. Initially I could not make it to work. It felt like constantly switching on and off. Sent message to seller but never got responded. Finally worked out. It was the projector not in the right 3D mode. Force the projector to DLP 3D, then I can enjoy 3D with those glasses. At the same time I bought the other brand for $40 for 4 of them on battery. Those are as good as this one in 3D effects. The glasses paired with projector right away. This one takes longer and may require several button pushes to get it right. Comparing to the cheaper one, which quite a few complained about how easy it was to break the ear piece. The design was flawed as it creates weak points in the legs. This one has metal legs which I believe will outlast the lenses. This one also has large covering area, which is nice but not necessarily an advantage in viewing. The nose piece need to be redesigned. It falls off on first use. But it could be easily reattached - that&rsquo;s the problem, easy going in and easy going out.BTW, it was very nice of the design to have glass clamps which you can use to replace the legs. It was very creative. However, when I tried it one, the glasses was too heavy to wear it that way. The full weight is transferred to your glasses and the nose pieces. With the legs on, somehow the weight is shifted elsewhere, making it more bearable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-on-arrival">Dead On Arrival</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the design of the glasses. They fit well over my prescription glasses. Unfortunately, I never got to see how well they work (or not) as they do not charge like a couple other reviewers have experienced. There is a sticker on each box that says they have passed testing or some similar wording. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case as neither one was able to charge up. Rather disappointed to have my time wasted. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a bad batch, but don&rsquo;t tell me you tested it if you didn&rsquo;t. If you had, you&rsquo;d realize there is a problem.The nose piece on one pair fell off easily a couple times when handling it to charge. As someone who has worn glasses for more years than I care to admit, they shouldn&rsquo;t fall off that easy.I&rsquo;m hoping someone will contact me to send out 2 pairs that have actually been verified to work as I would like to try them due to liking the fit and light weight. That&rsquo;s the only reason they didn&rsquo;t get 1 star. Will regrade if I get a functioning set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-and-workes-great">Fits and workes great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Initially had some ghosting on Xbox One (BenQ W1070), but works great now (low battery? re-sync? Xbox One update? not sure). Shortened the temples (ear piece) with 16 gauge tin shears for my 3 year old and 1.5 year old so it wouldn&rsquo;t pop forward when they laid their head back. Marked the silicone temple caps so I know which one&rsquo;s which. Company sent replacement temple caps for free when I asked and were very pleasant to deal with. The latest model comes with prescription glass clips that replaces the temples which is how my wife wears it. They do fit over prescription glasses, but wife preferred the clips. An improvement I&rsquo;d like to see is silicone contact points for the glass clips to reduce the chance of scratching the glasses.So these are very customizable as far as fit goes. I have 4 of these now, 2 older package (no glass clips) and 2 newer, and use the magnetic clasp box for storage instead of the bag, because they stack better. Watched Avatar 3D and Deep Sea 3D&hellip;fantastic!</p>

<p>I ordered two but only got 1. After I wrote an email to them, then I received another one after 3 days. How could they let this simple thing happened?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These just didn&rsquo;t do it for me. Cant&rsquo;t tell when they are charging or not, very cheaply made so I returned them and went with Blue Heaven, and Elephas . For the price these just anoint worth it</p>

<h5 id="the-glasses-work-great-and-they-sync-to-the-projector-immediately">The glasses work great and they sync to the projector immediately</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The glasses work great and they sync to the projector immediately. Love that they fold up for easy storage unlike others I have seen that remain open (like theater glasses). Only complaint is that the rubber on the arms of the glasses get caught in my hair pulling it out of any pony tail I have in. Otherwise these are perfect.</p>

<h5 id="above-and-beyond">Above and Beyond</h5>

<p>I love these glasses! They are lightweight, you can barely tell you are wearing them versus some of the first generation offerings from other companies.</p>

<p>The 3D glasses are lightweight and work well. No syncing needed, just push the button to turn on and your ready to watch. We are very pleased with our purchase.</p>
