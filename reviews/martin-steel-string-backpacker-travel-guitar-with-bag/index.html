<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-great-quality-backpacker-guitar-read-on">Great, great quality backpacker guitar! (read on)&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great, great quality backpacker guitar! Before buying, went and I checked this out at Guitar Center, so I knew exactly what I was getting, but the price was better here, plus here it came with a good sling and a quality padded soft-case (although the case only has a single strap which on a backpacker guitar 2 straps just makes more sense). The guitar itself is top notch. Wood quality is outstanding. Fit and finish is impeccable. Not the tiniest defect anywhere, mine arrived simply flawless. And it holds tune, has true, full, rich sound, and for its smaller size is surprisingly just as loud as its full-size Martin counterparts. This last feature surprised me and left me wondering why they even make guitars any bigger than this. Anyway, great purchase, no buyer&rsquo;s remorse at all. The only thing I have yet not found is a factory hard-case as, again, this is a backpacker guitar and since it turned out to be so nice I now fear scratching it when out camping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-just-for-traveling">Not Just for Traveling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this guitar because I go to college in the West coast of the US but live in the East coast of the US during breaks. As such, I travel quite a bit, and it can be a hassle to lug around a full-sized guitar, especially on airplanes where bringing a guitar along for the trip might lead to extra baggage fees. The Martin Backpacker fits perfectly in overhead compartments in airplanes. To make things even better, the guitar packs quite a sound for its small size. It really has a nice tone, a hybrid of sorts between a guitar and slight ukelele sound. Holding the guitar took a bit of getting used to due its strange shape but its nothing that won&rsquo;t work itself out with practice and time. I highly recommend using Martin&rsquo;s Silk and Steel Folk Strings with this guitar, it makes finger-picking (my preferred style of playing) such a joy and ease, and really brings out some warm tones. It is no longer just my travel guitar, but my go-to guitar.Buy this guitar if you want to bring your guitar with you wherever you go, especially if you mainly travel by plane. Again, don&rsquo;t be too concerned about the sound of the guitar. It is a Martin, after all, and it manages to provide accessibility without sacrificing volume and sound. This is my favorite guitar yet!</p>

<h5 id="great-little-guitar">Great little guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow&hellip;I&rsquo;m traveling the US for a year in my van and didn&rsquo;t think I had room for my acustic so gave it away - was looking for something small I could play on the road and ran across this. I don&rsquo;t leave a lot of reviews but was so impressed with this little guitar thought it would be a disservice not to. The size is perfect, easy to play, quality made instrument, and decent sound quality. Love the feel of the wood and how solid it is - I couldn&rsquo;t have imagined I could find a high quality, perfect sized guitar to take with me but this is it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-portable-and-comfortable-to-play">Solid, portable, and comfortable to play</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a solid, quality guitar. I paid for next day shipping, which was a joke (it was delayed by 5 days) but the guitar itself is beautiful and plays well. The string height was a little on the high side, but sanding down the bridge is an easy fix for that. There&rsquo;s also no truss rod in this guitar, but the neck is super thick, and they recommend using super light gauge strings exclusively, so i don&rsquo;t think warping will be a problem. The bag and strap they include are both quality, and the fit and finish are top notch. It really is more beautiful in person. I&rsquo;d recommend this guitar to anyone, whether you travel a lot, or just jam on your couch. Once you get the string height right by sanding down the bridge, it&rsquo;s a joy to play. I&rsquo;d absolutely buy another one. Just don&rsquo;t pay for next day shipping, because it&rsquo;s a joke lol</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-travel-guitar">Perfect Travel Guitar!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the size and sound of this guitar. Bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she has really enjoyed the playability at a compact size. The neck is very well shaped. It is a nice medium size, not too wide or deep. Takes a second to adjust to the small size, but the transition is minimal. This thing is loud as well! Has a nice bright tone. If you travel around a lot and want to have a guitar with you, this is the go to for sure. You wont be disappointed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handy-for-its-purpose">Handy for its purpose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Im in the military and use this whenever I go TDY or am working extra long shifts and have downtime. Bigger sound than I expected for such a small package, but its a sound you have to get used too. Obviously it doesn&rsquo;t have the full sound that a regular guitar does, but I grew to like it. Great for when you wanna jam real quick but dont wanna worry about it getting in the way. It has a special purpose so I feel good about adding it to my collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-of-art">Work of Art</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice guitar. I was amazed at the fine craftsmanship of this instrument. It was flawless and beautiful. My hats of to the Martin factory workers who built this. You did an awesome job. It sounds wonderful and will be cherished for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-great-price-and-i-love-it">Great product&hellip;great price&hellip;.and I love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an affordable Martin guitar. The tone is warm and mellow. It has the quality of construction you&rsquo;d expect from Martin. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with it. Now, if my playing were able to match its capability, I be in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-can-take-this-anywhere-and-i-love-it-it-is-louder-and-has-better-sound">I can take this anywhere and I love it. It is louder and has better sound &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can take this anywhere and I love it. It is louder and has better sound than I expected based on some reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-guitar-tough-and-portable-sounds-good">Nice little guitar. Tough and portable. Sounds good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw this weird thing at a pawn shop and my 13-year-old son liked it. He was due for a gift anyway and after looking up purchase price and reviews, I decided to get it for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-good-for-what-it-is">It&rsquo;s good for what it is</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for what it is. I bought this mainly to play while I spend a lot of hours sitting in the driver seat of my car (not driving of course) waiting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-travel-guitar-but-that-sacrifices-sound-and-the-large-neck-sacrifices-playability-but-it-s-light-and-portable">It&rsquo;s a travel guitar, but that sacrifices sound, and the large neck sacrifices playability. But it&rsquo;s light and portable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works as a travel guitar. But the sound doesn&rsquo;t live up to Martin standards. But then it wouldn&rsquo;t be small as travel guitar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a piece of junk - poorly made - don&rsquo;t buy one made in Mexico.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loosen-the-strings-when-not-playing">Loosen the strings when not playing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When not playing and storing the guitar, I would STRONGLY recommend loosening the strings. I didn&rsquo;t do so and after a few months, I noticed that the sound board has buckled a bit&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="practice-anywhere-anytime-you-get-the-urge">Practice anywhere..anytime..you get the urge..++++</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned a backpacker for 4 years.You do need to have the strap around your neck to sit An play it comfortabley.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="martin-backpacker-or-washburn-rover-and-honest-perspective">Martin Backpacker or Washburn Rover&hellip;.and honest perspective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this guitar 3 yrs ago and after receiving it, and its firsts initial tuning, I didn&rsquo;t touch touch it again until recently.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-saling-trip">for.saling.trip</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>wonderful</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-quite-satisfied-no">I&rsquo;m quite satisfied. No</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little travel guitar gets a LOT of criticism, however, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied. No, it doesn&rdquo;t have a lot of volume, and its&rsquo; bass is anemic. So what?</p>
