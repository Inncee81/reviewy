<blockquote>
<p>Ok, I&rsquo;ve waited about 4 days now before writing my review for this tablet. This is a incredible tablet, especially for the price I paid!I own an IPad 2, a HP Google tablet, a Asus Google tablet and I have to honesty say that this is my favorite tablet of all!The quality of this build is almost as good as a IPad. Yes I&rsquo;m serious! The screen resolution is unbelievable! It&rsquo;s just as good as a Retina IPad Air screen if not better. It is made from glass, colors truly pop on the ultra high def screen.Now on to what needs to be done for this tablet to be absolutely incredible:First thing you must do once you register it and get it up and running is install Windows 10! Yes you can still do this without any problems for free!After about 3 hours of tinkering with this tablet, it has become a incredible Windows 10 tablet with a fast Intel processor, great graphics, outstanding usability, and lots of fun! And it&rsquo;s like having a small Windows laptop in a tablet form. It&rsquo;s a waste if you don&rsquo;t upgrade to Windows 10 though! You should be a little IT savy, or have a friend or relative that is. But if your willing to put in the effort, you will be amazed at what a incredible tablet this is at this Amazing price!Tips: once I loaded Windows 10 on it, it left very little room left on the hard drive, only about 1.3 gigs were left. But here&rsquo;s the trick to gaining that back: go into settings and look to getting as much hard drive space back by a few simple adjustments already in Windows 10.The biggest trick was to have Windows 10 get rid of the pryer Windows 8 OS. Now if you do this you cannot go back to it! But who cares, Windows 10 is a great improvement over windows 8 with the same quality of Windows 7.Once I deleted the pryer OS I got back 5 and a half gigs of hard drive space! Now with the 64 gig micro sd card I installed pryer to starting the tablet up, setting up the future apps, programs, photos, music etc. to go to the card, I have plenty of space to do great things!Now some people who are probably not to IT savvy don&rsquo;t like Windows 10, but I love it! It diagnosis and automatically fixes any issues with the OS. I had a problem where the tablet froze, and Windows couldn&rsquo;t fix it at first. I was stuck on the blue screen of death. I had already called Amazon customer service to return the tablet. But I left it charging and about a hour later it restarted itself and has been working perfectly since!Tips: Charge the tablet up completely before attempting anything, and keep it plugged in when you upgrade to Windows 10.There are plenty of Windows forums to walk you through the installation process online. I think the keypad works great on most applications, once and a while I have to push the keyboard icon in the system tray. Yes you can add or hide the system tray. There are a lot of settings in Windows 10 to tweak this tablet.Now another wonderful thing I purchased here on Amazon was a Fintie brand IPad Pro 9.7 inch case with beautiful faux leather and fine felt type lining. This fits this tablet like a glove. All the cut out are almost identical to this tablet! Personally I don&rsquo;t need a keyboard for a tablet, and I like the case with the removable keyboard that came with it, but I prefer the Fintie case I got a lot more! I am attaching several pictures of the tablet with Windows 10 on it, and in the Fintie case I purchased here on Amazon made for the 9.7 inch IPad Pro Only! It was only $12.00 bucks and they have like 25 different colors.Don&rsquo;t Even hesitate getting this incredible tablet!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of now I&rsquo;m giving this tablet a 5 star rating. Time will tell. Screen is amazing. I&rsquo;ve owned a few cheap tablets before and this thing just blows them away. It comes with windows 8.1 which i dont mind. Others have upgraded to 10 but I&rsquo;ll hang out with 8.1 for now. Small amount of storage which i believe the price reflects. There is only one port on here which happens to be a mini usb i believe. I bought a multi port card reader by inateck and it works great. I was able to power my 2tb hard drive off it. Just beware it uses a little more battery. Only downside is i haven&rsquo;t figured out how to charge and use inateck port at same time. This unit comes with a Bluetooth keyboard and case that works well. I bought it mostly to write newsletters and minor photo editing /file transfers. I have gimp 2 installed and serrif page plusx8. So far its working great. Speakers aren&rsquo;t great but work. It does come with a usb to mini usb adapter also. But i wanted a little more and got one that has 3 usb ports and card readers as well. All is well.</p>

<p>Original Review (3/31/17)This is a steal if you are prepared to deal with some issues if they arise. I dd some research on this model and there can be some quality control problems to watch out for, but so far so good. First one I received was DOA. When I got the second one, I realized the first was previously opened. The second one&rsquo;s box was shrink-wrapped and had the orginal NuVision stickers still intact.Initial setup did not go well and had a couple of problems: it crashed, rebooted itself, and then went through the setup process again.This time, I could not get the wifi to connect. After trying to troubleshoot it, I was ready to give up and send it back. So, I reset it so none of my information would be on it when it went back. Within Win8.1, I was able to reset the user settings and basically start off as if it was a new PC. Since that was successful, I decided to try setting it up again. Glad I did! That worked! Logged in with no problems and it wanted to sync my OneDrive. Gotta stop that since this will not sync the hundreds of GB. I also turned off Automatic Updates. I did not install any applications or updates and just configured a bluetooth mouse and keyboard. Then I upgraded to Windows 10. There is enough room to upgrade without needing a extra SD card or USB drive. The upgrade went smoothly also. I had to reconnect the bluetooth devices, but that was no big deal.The screen resolution is great!. Actually it&rsquo;s too good for the few apps I intend to run, so I lowered the resolution. I really like the 4:3 format compared to 16:9 of many tablets this size. I tested some streaming video (with the best resolution of course) and the picture is incredible, but sometimes it buffered. Not a big deal for me, but this is not a high-powered machine. Don&rsquo;t expect it to play video flawlessly and well as any CPU/graphics intensive apps at lightning speed.It does come with a bluetooth keyboard and case, which is worth possibly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the whole purchase price. That is a nice bonus though I am not going to use either with this device. There are two layers of screen protection install on the device for shipping: the top layer with printed marketing text. The lower one is clear and can be used as an interim screen protector. There is a little nub that sticks out so you can lift and remove the screen protector completely, but I cut it off. A few people mention in forums that the screen is eerily the same size and dimensions (and resolution) of an iPad air 2 screen, so I ordered a screen protector that size. We&rsquo;ll see if it fits.As I mentioned earlier, do your homework about this. Google tabletpcreview and this model number and you will find an extensive forum with someone who has also put together all the drivers if you decide to start from scratch. If you are willing to put up with any issues that pop up, this is definitely a great buy. If you want a turnkey product that will work with no problems, you may want to look elsewhere. As you can tell, I am glad I had the patience to stick with this tablet!Updated (4/26/17)Still enjoying the tablet. It&rsquo;s under-powered, but it&rsquo;s not my main device. It&rsquo;s great for media content and other minor programs that I use. One thing that definitely helped after installing Win10 is optimizing the OS. Search on youtube and there are multiple resources. Should take you about an hour. I also put on ArmorSuit MilitaryShield - Apple iPad Air 2 Wifi Screen Protector + Full Body Skin Protector / Front + Back Anti-Bubble Ultra HD - Extreme Clarity &amp; Touch Responsive Shield with Lifetime Free Replacements with some modifications. The (front) screen protector pretty much aligned with the camera and was a bit off on the Windows logo, but good enough. The back protector which also has the sides needed to be trimmed for the volume buttons and for the back camera. Headphone jack, micro USB, and speakers needed no modifications. If you just want a screen protector, try any Apple Ipad Air 2 screen protector. It should fit. Overall, still happy with a Win10 tablet with great screen resolution for under $100.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a day or so, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with this tablet. For $95, you won&rsquo;t find anything this close to an iPad Air in terms of form factor, screen size, and screen ratio - however running Windows.I upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary Edition without any issues, although I am sometimes nagged about Windows being low on memory. I have an iPad Air 2 for my primary tablet, and a Mac for real work, but some tasks still occasionally require an actual Windows machine and this is just great for that, especially at the insane price of 95 dollars. I wouldn&rsquo;t pay much more though. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like an iPad in your hands - nowhere near as balanced and quality built, but again, hard to complain at the price.</p>
