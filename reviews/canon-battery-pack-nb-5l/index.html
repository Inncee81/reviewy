<h5 id="waring-do-not-order-from-this-overseas-vendor">WARING DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS OVERSEAS VENDOR</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was ordered from a company called USAAM - This charger is a piece of garbage!! You plug it in and the green light will come on and then it goes off!! I had also ordered the battery with the charger - how stupid of me. The batteries do the same when you put them in the charger - it blinks red, green off! I also tried the batteries in my canon charger (from canon) and they did not work!!! The worst part is that when I tried to return it amazon told me I had to wait for the seller to OK the return, in a foreign country! I never thought I would have to deal with an overseas company. I ordered from Amazon not someone I would have to deal with in China!@! Amazon said I had to wait 48 hours before they could look into it. That time has come and gone. Amazon now says that they will try to contact the seller and work this problem out!!! This could take 2- 3 weeks!! Why did I order from amazon? Because I have never had a problem when I needed to return something. How would you know that this is a foreign company you will be dealing with?I have purchase many third party items and it is still handled that same great way that I know amazon can do. This is just insulting - the item is garbage and I can&rsquo;t even get an OK to return it. I think that there should be a notice when the company is shipping from overseas. I will certainly be more careful in the future. I am disappointed in the product but more so in Amazon for not taking care of this ASAP</p>

<h5 id="not-canon-counterfiet-battery-stay-away">NOT CANON! COUNTERFIET BATTERY - STAY AWAY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading some of the reviews I thought I&rsquo;d buy this battery. I missed the reviews on people saying it&rsquo;s a counterfeit battery.Once it was received I was immediately suspicious as the quality of the print on the battery is nowhere near the original battery. The font is not clear nor crisp, the battery does not have the voltage or mA rating anywhere on it, and it states &ldquo;made in China&rdquo;, while the original is &ldquo;made in Japan&rdquo;. Not wanting to jump to conclusions I decided to check with Canon.After taking several pictures of the battery from all angles, as well as the packaging and hologram and sending them to Canon they confirmed the battery is counterfeit. I then ordered the &lsquo;eal Canon battery from B+H and after having both side by side it&rsquo;s completely obvious the battery, package, printing and even hologram is completely different.The only difference between this battery and the $5 ones you see on Amazon is the name &ldquo;Canon&rdquo; illegally printed on the battery, and the $20 price difference you&rsquo;re paying! It is NOT a Canon battery. If you want the original CANON battery, DO NOT buy this!If you want a cheap replacement, buy one of the $5 ones. You&rsquo;ll probably be getting the exact same battery, only without someone trying to take more of your money selling you something under false (and illegal) pretense. This battery may last a long time, I don&rsquo;t know. But if I pay for a Canon battery, and this battery is much more than most of the 3rd party replacements, I want an actual Canon battery, not a cheap fake with Canon printed on it.I&rsquo;m giving it a 1 star only because I cannot give a zero star.Now to give the whole story, I did contact the seller after determining the battery to be counterfeit and he did agree to a refund of my money. But the point is this is not a Canon original battery, confirmed by Canon. I would not recommend this battery at all. Either buy a Canon-original elsewhere or buy one of the $5-10 &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; 3rd party ones, get the same thing and save some money, and don&rsquo;t support someone selling a counterfeit product.</p>

<h5 id="not-an-authentic-canon-product">Not an authentic Canon product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this as a spare battery for my S100 camera and disappointed in the product. It was inauthentic and did not contain the Canon hologram. The print on the backside of this battery was also different from my original, authentic one. When it was fully charged the battery only lasted for, a generous, 100 photos. Very disappointed that I received a knock-off product and glad I was able to return it for a full refund.</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-counterfeit-batteries-out-there">Buyer beware: Counterfeit batteries out there :(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Original review [June 12, 2012]: I bought this battery in November 2011 as a backup battery to go with the Canon PowerShot S100 that we had just purchased.It arrived new, in it&rsquo;s original Canon packaging. It charges in a few hours and works well.Sometimes, I wish I had three of these as the S100 can go through battery juice like a camel in a desert, especially if you take any video and have the image stabilization turned on.If you have a Canon PowerShot S100, I highly recommend getting (at least) one of these as a backup.Edit [Jan 13, 2014]: As others have mentioned, buyer beware. Although fulfilled by Amazon, the battery I purchased here from &ldquo;Steve Borders Store&rdquo; turned out to be counterfeit. This battery never had quite as good of a charge as the battery that came with the camera. Over time, the battery I purchased on Amazon as deteriorated to the point where if it lasts for a few minutes shooting video, I&rsquo;m lucky. Usually, it&rsquo;ll die within seconds.Although the packaging appeared genuine when it arrived, there are small, subtle differences in what&rsquo;s printed on this counterfeit battery versus the battery that came with the camera. For example, the Canon logo on the counterfeit has a less rounded, more angular capital C. There are a number of other printing issues that give it away upon close inspection.I took pictures of both batteries (the one that came with the camera &amp; the one I purchased on Amazon) and sent them to Canon&rsquo;s anti-counterfeiting team. They confirmed that this one is counterfeit. Here are two images showing the front and back of both real Canon battery (at top) and the battery I purchased on Amazon:front: h[&hellip;]back: [&hellip;]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure if it is an original Canon product. The picture presented by seller is from an original Canon Battery, like the original that came with camera. However, the seller sent to me one that is different of this picture. The battery was shipped inside a transparent plastic bag. BTW, I have to use this stuff to verify the quality of this &lsquo;copy&rsquo;. I will not buy anything else from this seller.</p>
