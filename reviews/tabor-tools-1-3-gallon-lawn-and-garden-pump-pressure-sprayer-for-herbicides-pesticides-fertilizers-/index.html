<h5 id="best-sprayer-value-i-ve-seen-tabor-tools-1-3-gallon-pump-sprayer-with-shoulder-strap">Best sprayer value I&rsquo;ve seen.- Tabor Tools 1.3-Gallon Pump Sprayer with Shoulder Strap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tabor Tools 1.3-Gallon Pump Sprayer with Shoulder Strap, Ideal for Pest Control Chemicals and Weeds Killers. Suitable for Mild Cleaning Solutions and Bleach, Enjoy our 12 Months GuaranteeDelivered on time and in excellent condition.Just what I needed to spray insecticide.Translucent container allows viewing liquid level.Ounce and liter graduations are printed on the container side although only approximate.(Measure your mixtures independently before filling the sprayer.)Usage instructions printed on container and box. A .pdf instruction manual was also emailed to me by Tabor Tools.Pressure release valve. If you have ever had to open a pressurized sprayer you will appreciate this feature.The 1.3 gallon (5 liter) capacity allows additional air volume when mixing 1 gallon solutions. The additional air volume provides pressure for a longer time before needing to pump.Valve trigger locks on if needed and can be disassembled for cleaning if necessary. (Don’t lose the parts.)Large opening on top makes filling more convenient.</p>

<h5 id="what-s-the-little-knob-for">What&rsquo;s the little knob for?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall happy with the sprayer but some basic written instructions in addition to what&rsquo;s written on the box and abreakdown of its features would be helpful.For example&hellip;what is the small knob for that&rsquo;s screwed on top of the trigger area? It&rsquo;s very tight and I hesitate to force it for fear it&rsquo;s not supposed to be screwed on and off. Is it an adjustment knob if some sort? What!.The spray/solid stream adjustment I agree with others is very tight&hellip;.which I suppose is a good thing to prevent leakage around its base. Only by experimenting with it do you discover how much to twist it to change the spray.I received and used it today on my shingles for mildew and was pleased to see it sprayed a solid stream at least 15-20 feet as long as you pump it up enough. The trigger lock is a little awkward to set but that&rsquo;s a minor thing to get used to.The 1.3 gallon size was a selling point to me&hellip;the usual 1 gallon size can be used up pretty quickly if you&rsquo;re using a solid stream and the weight of a full 1.3 gallon load is just about right and not excessive. I would recommend this sprayer based on my one time use today.Don</p>

<h5 id="still-useful-and-easy-for-me-to-carry">Still useful and easy for me to carry</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Depends for what one plans on using this. I wanted for outside cleaning from algae and mildew that got on the house and window sill from plants and pollen. I used a scrub brush and wanted a hose type device to rinse w/ water. My own hose hooks up out back and I did not wish to buy a longer hose or extension to drag to front of house. In addition I wished for a portable device in general. For what I needed it for, it worked out. A basic hose w/a spray nozzle would have had much more pressure and I wish this had that as it would have made my job much faster. it says pressure wash and customers were saying they used on roof and such to clean the house so that is why I got it. This does work but is more of a mist and much less force than I would have expected and hoped for. Still useful and easy for me to carry, fill and use so I will keep it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-used-it-twice-and-works-great">So far so good. Used it twice and works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. Used it twice and works great. Spray stream adjustable from fine mist to strong thin stream that reaches quite far. Pump keeps the sprayer pressurized for quite a while. Make sure that the yellow part of the wand is fully inserted, or spray pressure may be weak. Shoulder strap tends to get wet when filling, and not easily removable, but dries quickly. Hopefully it will keep working as well with prolonged use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-on-bikes">Works great on bikes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in an apartment building and don&rsquo;t have access to a hose of any sort to wash my bike. Seeing as its my mane mode of transportation keeping it running well is really important to me so i bought this hoping that I could use it as a sort of hand held pressure washer to spray soap and de greaser of my bike and its been perfect. The quality feels superb and the pressure is perfect for what I am using it for. I was worried about the size being too small but quickly learned it was more than enough to clean a single bike. Would buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-it-works-like-a-charm">and it works like a charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to help clean up our &ldquo;doggie&rdquo; yard, and it works like a charm! I highly recommend this product, it is easy to use for whatever kind of spraying you need to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-no-nonsense-sprayer">Works well, no-nonsense sprayer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, I wasn&rsquo;t going to write a review until I fully used this unit a few times. While I do agree this is a fine product for most uses, it still didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;wow&rdquo; me (not that that is/was a bad thing&hellip;but we are discussing a liquid sprayer after all).Pros:1.) Small unit for &ldquo;quick&rdquo; spots, pumps fast due to small size. It is nice you can mix the product plus one whole gallon of water.2.) The wand is plenty long and the hose is ultra flexible and never seems to get kinked up. Also, the all plastic nozzle is nice as it does not corrode as some of the brass ones do.Cons:1.) Stroke of the pump is somewhat short for how tall the unit is. This is not really a big deal until the sprayer gets about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the way pressurized as then the short stroke makes it somewhat difficult to get the final full pressure (long before the pressure relief releases).2.) The shoulder strap really just gets in the way. Maybe this is a preference of mine, but I am 6&rsquo;-0&rdquo; tall and find it more comfortable just letting the pump handle extend out to carry around vs. using the strap. The wand and hose are plenty long to allow the tank to drop lower to the ground while walking and spraying.Bottom line: when my 2.0 gallon &ldquo;Round Up&rdquo; sprayer craps out, I will strongly consider getting the 2.0 gallon Tabor unit to replace it.</p>
