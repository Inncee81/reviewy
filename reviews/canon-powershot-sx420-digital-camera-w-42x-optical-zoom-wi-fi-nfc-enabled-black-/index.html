<p>Powerful 42x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer for outstanding optical performance</p>

<p>42x Optical Zoom (24–1008mm)
Don&rsquo;t miss a moment with the versatility of the PowerShot SX420 IS camera&rsquo;s 42x Optical Zoom lens. It gives you a reach all the way from 24mm to 1008mm, which means if you&rsquo;re capturing your child playing sports at the far end of the field, you can still see his movements and expressions. A 24mm wide-angle lens enables easy capture of brilliant landscapes and large group portraits, and the Optical Image Stabilizer helps ensure you get clear and virtually noise-free images whether you&rsquo;re shooting near or far.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the ideal shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make effective IS settings to help capture a steady image.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the Image Stabilizer is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Built-in Wi-Fi and NFC allows for easy sharing and transferring of images and videos</p>

<p>What a wonderful camera! It&rsquo;s light. It&rsquo;s photos are SO REAL. And it&rsquo;s SO EASY to operate. I bought it in RUBY RED, and I can FIND IT anywhere, even in the dark.

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of photography or non-phone camera experience. So, I really just jumped into the DSLR world with this camera. Having this for a week, I really enjoy it for how much it can do.Seems like a lot of the reviews here are people that don&rsquo;t understand how cameras work (ISO, aperture, shutter speed). You DO NOT have full control over aperture or shutter speed. It&rsquo;s an entry level camera. If you want full control, buy a Rebel T5! The specs are not professional either (they&rsquo;re mid-range at best), so don&rsquo;t expect your quality of pics to be super awesome starting out, you need practice. This camera is a tool, you have to control it. It&rsquo;s not going to take great pics by itself!Here&rsquo;s a few of my favorite pics I&rsquo;ve taken in the past week. Enjoy! :)</p>
