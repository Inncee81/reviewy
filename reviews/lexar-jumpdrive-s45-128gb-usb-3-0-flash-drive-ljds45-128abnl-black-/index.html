<h5 id="a-great-thumbdrive-flashlight">A great thumbdrive &amp; flashlight.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did some benchmarking/performance testing to compare this with the equivalent Samsung 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive Fit (MUF-128BB/AM). In a nutshell, it performed identically. Both drives warmed sligtly to the touch, but never became more than slightly warm, even during extended write operations taking over 10 minutes.One thing worth noting is that the Samsung flash drive does not seem to include a status indicator light, whereas the Lexar incorporates what is essentially a room-illuminating flashlight, in the form of its blue LED status indicator light. Seriously, if you are using this drive in a dark room, it will illuminate the entire room with blue flickering. For some, this may be undesirable.Update on 2016-08-20: It may also be worth noting that the Lexar drive does not include a hole/slot/notch suitable for attaching a lanyard. The Samsung alternative does, albeit a very small one (a bit challenging to actually get a thin lanyard attached to it). Given how tiny these drives are, lanyards can be a useful addition to them.</p>

<h5 id="lexar-junkdrive-s45-yeah">Lexar JunkDrive S45! Yeah!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: ONE still (as of 8/31/17) works perfect. Two of the three bad drives fail to be operated by Windows 10 or Linux and just continues to blink the read/write light (see pic). The other failed drive can be read but that&rsquo;s about it. During write it will throw out an unspecified error in Win 10 and removes itself from File Explorer without my intervention. Huh? Not cool. They can be seen by the OS, just not formatted or wrote onto without errors or crashing the system entirely. I bought these because Crucial products have been rock solid in the past, USB 3.0, it has a read/write activity light that can be seen in daylight, and the low profile allowed it to steer clear of getting snapped off while staying in my Surface Pro 4. Now I&rsquo;m seriously questioning the the reliability of the remaining two. I scanned all systems the drives were used in and Windows found zero integrity violations plus my other two drives made by a different manufacturer work fine so I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s nothing on my end. Three down and one left playing my tunes in the work truck. If you&rsquo;re looking for reliability, this drive isn&rsquo;t the one you want.</p>

<h5 id="super-handy-size-not-as-fast-as-i-d-like-but-good-value">Super Handy Size - Not as Fast as I&rsquo;d Like, But Good Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good value and about as small as these can get. I got this to keep in my laptop which has only a 128gb ssd hard drive, so this effectively doubles the space, especially when working with large groups of photos. I most recently put this drive to the test while downloading over 120gb of photos while volunteering at our state&rsquo;s Special Olympics Summer Games. It was the first year I&rsquo;d used this drive as a backup, and found I was waiting more than I wanted for the photos to finish writing. After running tests at home, I found out this drive was part of what was slowing us down. I always thought flash drives were faster than traditional hard drives but found out that I could write to my WD 3TB Passport about five times as fast as to this little Jump Drive. That said, hardly anyone will be writing that much to a drive in one day. For keeping in your computer for extra memory (plus you can write to it and pop it out to transfer files easily to other computers), this little guy is super handy. It does heat up when writing over a couple of GB to it so &ndash; if you pull it out just after writing 4 or 5gb to it, you might drop it like it&rsquo;s hot&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="small-and-works-great-for-a-large-number-of-mp3-files">Small and works great for a large number of MP3 files.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work as expected. It came formatted for FAT32. I was not expecting that but it was what I need for music on a thumb drive for the car. The car does not understand NTFS format. This is a lot of music in MP3 format (many days worth for sure). I like the size. It has a blue LED in the &ldquo;head&rdquo; (the part that sticks out). It does not bother me as our car has a cover over the USB slot and I keep that closed (as far as it can with this inserted). With this in the drive the cover closes almost all the way which is why I wanted the small size. If I could get one with a smaller top I would but this is just about as good as I gets for small.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is useless. First, why does a USB drive need a light. Not a big deal, but just seems odd. The big issue with it is that I am using it with a photo frame and it keeps getting corrupted. I&rsquo;ve tried it with two different photo frames. At first it works, but then after a day or so the files become corrupted and either don&rsquo;t display at all or appear with part of the photo deleted or pixelated. Eventually, both frames said the drive is corrupted and can&rsquo;t be read. When I put it back in my computer to fix the files, I confirm the images are damaged. Very strange. I&rsquo;m sure there are better options out there.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-use-for-nvidia-shieldtv-or-other-android-box">Do NOT use for NVIDIA ShieldTV or other Android box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to expand the shared storage of my NVIDIA ShieldTV. Bad idea.Constant R/W flickering, and it seemed to be very fast until it warmed up, then it would stall or idle. When you have gigabytes of data on something that halts, your performance comes to a grinding halt.I don&rsquo;t know if the problem was that it was heating up with constant use and it had a limited surface area to disperse heat, but this was absolutely unsuitable for the purpose I purchased it to fit.For a general storage device with less-than-constant transfers, it&rsquo;ll probably be fine for you.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-cool">Good product! &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome usb drive! Better than my old Sandisk ultra fit 32gb, not have the &ldquo;Overheating Problem!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="failed-at-the-6-month-mark-expected-better">Failed at the 6 month mark, expected better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased in February 2017, drive seems to work quickly using windows 10 systems. The speed to write is not too consistent but I cannot determine if it is my systems writing to it or the jump drive itself as I have no other usb 3.0 flashdrive yet to it compare to. The biggest problem is it is now August (a few days over 6 months from purchase) and the drive is not writing data or allowing data to be deleted. It just blinks its constant blue blink, then stops, the does it again. It cannot be written to, and not all of the data can be read although thankfully much of it. I cannot delete files from it, I cannot overwrite data on it, and windows 10 is unable to repair the drive. I was hoping this flash drive would last three years and not just 6 months. I am not impressed. I cannot format the drive nor repair the drive.The blue drive activity light is bright. This is annoying in a dark room yet probably nice for some applications. A little duct tape can fix this if it becomes and issue for you.</p>

<h5 id="quickly-becomes-garbage">Quickly becomes garbage.</h5>

<p>Failed after 6 months with same problem as everybody else. All systems recognized that it is there, but none can format it. Tried in Linux, MacOS, Windows 10, Windows 8.</p>

<p>Good purchase. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-time-is-worth-way-more-than-the-aggravation">My time is worth way more than the aggravation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>while read speed is more or less adequate, quite possibly the slowest write speed of any thumb drive I&rsquo;ve used in the last 5yrs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-drive-with-nice-encryption-software">Great drive with nice encryption software</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great thumb drive for my car music. Just know that the flashing LED is pretty bright, so that may be an issue if your USB slot isn&rsquo;t concealed inside a console.</p>

<p>awesome!</p>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money-1">Don&rsquo;t waste your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this to store movies and videos to play on my laptop when flying. I got about 50 movies on it. I put it in a cloth bag because it&rsquo;s so small I thought I might lose it.</p>

<h5 id="failed-after-4-months-lost-all-data">Failed after 4 months. Lost all data!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unit was flawless for 4 months, then became unreadable and all data was lost. Thank goodness I had a backup! Do not trust this device with your valuable data!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-addition-to-mac">Great Addition to Mac</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an 11” MacBook with limited storage on the local hard drive. I bought this to store movies on as well as other large files. It works great!</p>
