<h5 id="perfect-buy">Perfect buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow this thing is awesome! I took it out today for the first time. Before I took it out I did a few upgrades. I got a better anchor, swivel seat, trolling motor, and added another rod holder! These are a must! The swivel seat was 7dollars from Walmart! I live in an apartment and drive a Kia Optima so this is perfect for me, it all packs right into my trunk. I also got an electric pump which pumps it up pretty well, then I top it off with a manual pump. I was worried about hooking the pontoon with s fishing pole, but you&rsquo;d literally have to set the hook as hard as you can to even get through the outer layer.</p>

<h5 id="nice-boat-looks-like-a-pro-level-boat-at-the-lakeside">Nice boat, looks like a pro level boat at the lakeside.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing cheap about this boat. The frame is large, at least 1 inch tubing. Everything seems to be powder coated. Frame pieces line up and pins drop in without rubber mallet smacking. I can&rsquo;t even say that about my Port-a-Bote. (Since sold) I needed to keep a mallet with it to get seats etc. to line up. None of that crap with this boat.The heavy nylon pontoon covering removes with large sleeping bag type zippers. Lots of storage pockets with large zippers. My first time out, I launched next to a guy with a RIB boat, and his obviously expensive boat had the same inflate/deflate valves. He borrowed my double action pump because his foot pump was too slow, and the same fitting worked in his boat&rsquo;s valves.I read other reviews talking about adding a swivel seat piece, and it&rsquo;s very easy. (I ordered the swivel piece along with the boat) The 1st time out though was irritating because I used whatever hardware I had on hand. The wingnuts will leave holes in your fingers, standard bolts spin and don&rsquo;t get tight enough. The photos show version 2.0 of the seat adjustment. I used carriage bolts in the swivel part because the square head section prevents spinning of the bolt, and the large handles of the thumb knobs makes tightening/loosening magnitudes easier. The knobs are Ace Hardware <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> x 20 thumb screws which are about $4.50 each. The swivel is attached to the seat with #14 x 1.5&rdquo; screws. Note that this was all well worth it, as A) You really need a seat swivel to spin and reach things in the cargo basket, and B) adding cargo, trolling motor, ice chest, whatever, changes the balance of the boat, so you need frequent seat adjustments. (For each trip out on the water)It tracks nicely, much better than the Tote-n-Float rubber raft I had years ago. If you row backwards and but some pull into the oars, you can keep up with a kayak, so it does move along easy. I row forward 98% of the time. And those oars. The tubing is about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; thick, these are NOT toy boat oars. There are double locking knobs. The only thing that I might change later is adding pin lock type oar locks so I don&rsquo;t have to get the paddles up vertical and then keep them that way while rowing. That will mean drilling the oar tubing though, and that&rsquo;s a maybe.Here&rsquo;s a caveat about small pontoon boats, and one I didn&rsquo;t think about before getting one. I consider it to be a &ldquo;death grip&rdquo; boat. As in keep a death grip on your binoculars, camera, tackle box, cellphone, knife, can of pop/beer, satellite communicator, (Inreach Explorer, you NEED one of those!) or whatever else you have out and are handling while out in it. You are on a seat in open water, feet on pegs like a motorcycle. You drop something in water more than a few inches deep and it&rsquo;s not shiny and easy to see in the mud, or if it doesn&rsquo;t float, it&rsquo;s gone. I repeat, it&rsquo;s GONE. There&rsquo;s nothing underneath you and/or your seat, there&rsquo;s no floor, the mesh thing directly under the seat won&rsquo;t catch it unless you&rsquo;re really lucky.One last thing, I&rsquo;ve read bad reviews about this &ldquo;problem&rdquo; too: keep a close eye on the air pressure. My motorcoach, with 120 PSI commercial 11R22.5 truck tires changes all the time. (TPMS on the dash) They can be 15% higher on the sun side of the coach while traveling on the freeway. They lose it when the temp drops overnight to the point alarms go off on the TPMS. (The TPMS and I have a love/hate relationship) The pontoons are low pressure and very sensitive to temp changes. Leave them &ldquo;soft&rdquo; until you actually put it into the water and head out. Leave them soft if you&rsquo;re heading to the water with an assembled boat in the back of your truck. When out on the water, If the sun gets to them and/or you move into warm shallows, you may have to let them out a little. NEVER leave the shore without your air pump. (Kind of goes without saying though)</p>

<h5 id="excellent-boat">EXCELLENT Boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I work for a &ldquo;major outdoor retailer&rdquo; and sell the &ldquo;XT&rdquo; version of this pontoon&hellip;I purchased THIS version on Amazon because the price was -way- better than what I could purchase it for through my employer.Disclaimers aside, I&rsquo;ve sold dozens of these pontoons and based on (my) customer feedback decided to purchase one for myself. I could not be any happier with the quality and performance of this boat. In it&rsquo;s price point there is simply not another pontoon that will compare. Whether I&rsquo;m using the oars, &ldquo;kicking&rdquo; the boat with flippers or using my 30# electric trolling motor the boat performs quite well. It is very easy to assemble and disassemble (less than 10 minutes either way) and it is light enough for this old guy to haul 50 feet down to the water. I did make one modification (so far) and that was to replace the (non-swivel) seat that comes with the boat and install a regular boat seat with a swivel&hellip;which makes for a much more comfortable day on the water.If you read the reviews for this boat on Amazon (and other) websites you will occasionally see a negative review and typically the issue involves the valves. As someone who sells these boats I can -promise- you that the majority of the issues people have with the valves are the result of people over inflating the pontoons beyond the recommended 2.5 pounds of pressure. I have also seen one or two reviews critical of the customer service provided by Classic Accessories. All I can say in that regard is that I have had the opportunity to call them several times on behalf of my customers and they have -always- been friendly, accommodating and efficient.</p>

<h5 id="far-exceeded-my-expectations">Far exceeded my expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the best made products I have purchased in a long time. Extremely detailed clear instructions for assembly. All parts fit together easily. Whoever designed this really knew what they were doing.When inflating, remember a Boston valve will allow air to enter the chamber even though it appears to be closed.Very easy to row and works well with electric trolling motor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the raft on time and in good shape no damage or anything,took and laid out all the parts and read instructions,took about 30 minutes first time putting together,15 minutes the next time,had yhe boat on the water 5 times now fishing,its very stable very easy to row,even in a mild wind works good with electric trolling motor,seems well built with alot of thought into it for the fisherman,i really like it but i agree witj others it neefs a swivel seat ,which i plan on remedying soon,its alot of fun ,now camt wait for multi day trip down johnday river with friends,would recomend this to anyone who is looking for one,this camt be beat for the money,very pleased with it so far</p>
