<h5 id="excellent-quality-coax-and-f-connectors">Excellent quality coax and &ldquo;F&rdquo; connectors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had recently purchased a cheaper 50&rsquo; coax cable with &ldquo;F&rdquo; connectors 50FT F-f RG6 Patch Cable Blk Premium Retail Blister Pack but returned it. The product photo did not match what I received.The connectors and molded ends on that cheap coax cable were so bad it was nearly impossible to tighten them to my cable box and TV. And once &ldquo;tightened&rdquo; the cable caused the signal to flicker if it was moved the slightest amount.So I began looking again for a better quality cable and discovered this Mediabridge cable. What a difference in quality. Much much better and with excellent quality F-connectors too. These are easy to hand tighten and if you still want a completely snug fit, you can use a wrench to give it a final tweak. Or you could install the included easy grip connectors which make hand tightening pretty easy.The cable is not picking up interference from anything else and the connection to the cable box and TV is secure. This is a great quality cable for the money. I wish I had bought it the first time around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-inexpensive-quality-cable">An inexpensive quality cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally got around to installing this Mediabridge cable. My original cable TV installer ran the cable line from the box on the back of the house all the way around the exterior to the side of the house entering the family room through a hole they drilled through the brick exterior wall. After many years of inclement weather the cable was ready to be replaced, especially since the connector was loose and causing pixelation and channel loss at random times. I disconnected the original cable from the cable box outside and ran this Mediabridge cable in it&rsquo;s place, but instead of running around the perimeter of the house on the outside, I drilled a hole right below the outside cable box and ran the new cable through the laundry room into the crawlspace where it connects to a four way splitter. The installation was not at all difficult, and no more pixelation! You can tell this is a quality cable just by the way it feels. The performance proves it. Some other cable manufacturers dare to charge over $50 for the same length and quality. I will buy Mediabridge cables whenever there is a need.</p>

<h5 id="mediabridge-cables-are-always-good-for-me">Mediabridge cables are always good for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ran this from an outdoor antenna down to a splitter in the basement. Good quality cable with nice compression F-connectors on it. Tri-shielded is plenty for the average homeowner unless you some extremely powerful sources of electronic noise running along the length of the wire. It is UL rated for in-wall use, not that it matters to the average homeowner. I would definitely buy this brand again, as I have bought other cables from them in the past that were always good quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cable-and-cheaper-than-locally-available">Great cable and cheaper than locally available</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pleased with the cable. Bought it as part of a &ldquo;Dish-removal&rdquo; process for home. :-DI put two antennae on my roof to pick up stations from two markets - each about 55 miles away - and ran through a signal combiner and then ran a drop to the TV with this cable. Works just fine. I found that it&rsquo;s very pliable which was a help running a drop in a pretty small space (through the top plate opening and down an exterior wall cavity that is insulated).Also, I like the little blue collars that are on each connector. If you don&rsquo;t throw them away like I was going to, they make it much easier to thread the coupling onto a barrel adapter or the end terminal.Oh, and it&rsquo;s cheaper than Lowe&rsquo;s, Best Buy or WalMart in my area.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-coax-cable">Excellent coax cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good quality cable: rugged and well made. The plastic covers over the end of the connectors protect the center conductor during shipping and installation, especially when you have to feed it through tight spots. Also, the blue plastic sleeves around the nut of the F connector make it easier to tighten it.I purchased this cable to replace a shorter (25&rsquo;) RG-59 with higher losses, to be able to mount the antenna outside. The signal strength seemed better with this longer (50&rsquo;) RG-6.Given the quality and the price, I definitely recommend this product.Second purchase:I recently ordered a second cable to add another antenna to my cable-cut configuration. Mediabridge continues to be my coax cable of choice: solid and well made. The EZ grip connector caps make it much easier to attach, especially in tight places.</p>

<h5 id="spectacular-product">Spectacular Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, coax is coax, or at least that&rsquo;s been my attitude for years because TV is TV.Right&hellip;&hellip;?Then I got Verizon FIOS, which is connected to my existing home multi room multi brand and type coax ecosystem from a multi decade seies of owners.Not all TVs looked clear.So on the advice of friends, I explicitly purchased this brand of Coax and, one by one replaced my coax cable runs to each room.What happened?If you wear glasses, you will know what I mean as I explain the change.Ever wander around after doing dirty dusty yard work, then come into the kitchen, and clean your glasses in the sink with dishwashining soap?SUDDENLY EVERYTHING IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.So it is with this cable.Before replacing the splitters, suddenly every TV was clearer and crisper.Having done coax networks long ago (remember 10 B-T, Ethernet) I was especially interested in stripping the cable ends and crimping the coax connectors.Well the quality of the &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; layers makes this cable a dream.So my coax cutters / strippers and crimpers worked perfectly.And stripped ends slid right Into the coax ends (perfect plastic insulation makes the difference)I can&rsquo;t recommend this cable enough.It works, and later, with a borrowed tester, it was tested and it has a near perfect signal to noise ratio.Replacing my generic splitters with higher bandwidth capable splitters didn&rsquo;t appreciably make it all clearer.So now I have to admit that in a regular ranch house, coax is not just any coax.And start with this coax first, if you want clarity.If you want a sharp clear, responsive picture with FIOS, or I&rsquo;ll bet the similar offerings from cable companies, GET THIS CABLE !</p>

<h5 id="if-i-need-more-i-ll-buy-this-cable-again">If I need more, I&rsquo;ll buy this cable again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cable looks and feels great.It looks like a good quality cable. I see no defects of any sort.It feels like a quality cable. Thick, dense, not too stiff.</p>
