Product Description
Improve your oral health with the new Philips Sonicare Essence+. This rechargeable toothbrush is the evolution of the classic Philips Sonicare Essence featuring unique and effective Sonicare technology. It is designed to clean where plaque hides, gently removing up to 3x more plaque than a manual toothbrush for cleaner and whiter teeth. Essence+ fits all Philips Sonicare snap-on brush heads (does NOT fit e-Series brush heads), has a smartimer to make sure you are brushing for the full 2 minute recommended time, and has a battery light indicator so you know when it is time to recharge. Philips Sonicare Essence+ is the best way to upgrade from a manual toothbrush for results you can see and feel.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-help-but-compare-it-to-my-e-series-brush">Can&rsquo;t help but compare it to my e-series brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 10 years now. I&rsquo;m one of those people who gets just about every dental problem you can (grinding teeth, soft teeth, on and off of meds that affect them) so I will do whatever I can to protect them best I can. That has included using these brushes.They have a 2 minute timer, because that is a lot longer than you think it is (while brushing your teeth anyway). I highly recommend these brushes to anyone as your teeth tend to feel cleaner that when using a manual brush (probably thanks to the aforementioned time issue).The brush I had at home when this one arrived was one of the e-series brushes. I was a bit leery of getting a different version, with different brush heads. Now that I have both, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this version over the e-series. I&rsquo;m including a picture of the two together (the one on the left being the e-series, the one on the right is this model I am reviewing.The two main differences are the charger and how the brush heads connect to the base.The brush heads - This model beats the e-series brush.- The e-series brush heads are screwed into place. The threads on the brush are so small in some areas that even a q-tip cannot clean it easily. Also there is a well at the top of the brush that holds the e-series piece inside. Gunk also gets into there. It&rsquo;s not pretty but more importantly seems like there are too many spots to hold onto anything nasty that gets on it.- This model has a flat surface on both the brush (minus the piece the brushes snap onto) and the brush heads. There are fewer places to collect water, toothpaste, etc. Wipes down so much easier.Charging - The two models tie.- The e-series has a larger charging base, with a spot underneath to wind the cord into for storage. To charge you set the brush base onto a flat surface that has sort of little walls around it to hold the brush into place.- This model has a little nub and you line it up with the groove on the brush and snap it into place. A much smaller charging surface means no place to store the cord.They seem to be the same quality when it comes to what matter the most - cleaning your teeth. Both do an equally good job at that.</p>

<h5 id="great-affordable-electric-toothbrush">Great Affordable Electric Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great affordable basic electric toothbrush. I have had the fancier more expensive Sonicare brushes in the past and never used all those extra features. So when my last one finally deteriorated after over 10 years of use, I decided to give the cheaper, more basic one a try. It is working great so far and I hope it lasts over 10 years like my last one. One thing I have learned, though, is to always remove the brush head after every use and wipe off the top of the electric tooth brush so the leftover toothpaste does not accumulate and start to mold.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dentist-and-hygienist-recommended">Dentist and Hygienist Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a gift&hellip;given because I have one already, and it works great. The recipient had never used an electronic toothbrush before, and she loves it. My wife has the high-end model with all the bells and whistles, but I like this model because it&rsquo;s compact and the charger easily fits in a dop kit.Recommended by my dentist and my hygienist, I now only have to go in once a year for a light cleaning. Before the Sonicare, my cleaning visits were necessary every six months. Think about it. Eliminating just one cleaning session with your hygienist would pay for several Sonicares!Highly recommend, and would purchase again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-powerful-as-newer-models">Not as powerful as newer models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Philips Sonicare toothbrush for over 20 years and never had a compliant. I&rsquo;m however not satisfied with this latest purchase. It doesn&rsquo;t feel as powerful as previous models. The last model I used before this was Healthywhite. I switched to the less expensive Essense+ because didn&rsquo;t need the bells and whistles of the more expensive models such as UV sanitizer unit, travel case and bag Etc. And since I was sure from the reviews and comparisons that I could use the Diamond Clean brush heads with Essense+ I was fully expecting that the vibration and power would maintain the level of cleaning. However the cleaning feels weak and I find myself brushing twice as long to compensate. I&rsquo;m not happy with my purchase.</p>

<h5 id="best-sonicare-value-bang-for-your-buck-as-long-as-you-don-t-have-small-hands-this-is-probably-the-one-you-want">Best sonicare value bang for your buck&hellip;. as long as you don&rsquo;t have small hands this is probably the one you want.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works good. Same motor and batteries as the sonicare 2,3.Handle is big. Which is nice since I have big hands. If you have small hands&hellip; you&rsquo;ll probably want to get a different model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it..my teeth feel clean, look clean, My dentist said I&rsquo;m doing a good job&hellip;.my teeth are in good shape&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="definitely-better-than-the-models-that-cost-less">definitely better than the models that cost less</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is definitely better than the model one price level below it. It is lighter yet more substantial and has the better battery. The models that cost less than this one feel cheaper and are bulkier because of the lower quality battery. This model is the one to get. Personally, the features of the higher grade models seem superfluous.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-the-e-series">Better than the e-series</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally better than the older soniccare! I was so happy to see this much easier to use and handle brush, and even happier to see it less expensive than the old ones. No more yuckiness inside the top of it (I had to just take the brush off each time, rinse the inside, and store them separately til next time, because, gross)), no more twisty turny trying to put the brush into the base and it not be facing the right way. Seems easier for my arthritic hands to hold. And my teeth and gums are just as happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-like-this-one-and-it-makes-my-teeth-feel-clean">I really like this one and it makes my teeth feel clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this one and it makes my teeth feel clean. It is much better than my old Sonicare. I recommend it. It also stays cleaner than my old one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it works well, but I have to charge it very week.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This toothbrush doesn&rsquo;t hold a charge (2-3 days tops) and I couldn&rsquo;t return it. Buy it from another seller if you don&rsquo;t want to get ripped off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brush-head-doesn-t-fit">Brush head doesn&rsquo;t fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got an Essence from Amazon last October, and that&rsquo;s my first electronic toothbrush. It was great. Then a few days ago I saw a $10 coupon and considered upgrade to Essence+.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good deal</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="philips-sonicare-is-losing-it-s-luster">Philips Sonicare is losing it&rsquo;s luster</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes since my dentist recommended them 15 or 20 years ago. I needed to replace a Sonicare toothbrush with a failed on/off button that didn&rsquo;t last&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product as described</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-sonicare-s-best">Not Sonicare&rsquo;s best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This toothbrush does not seem to clean my teeth like the past two Phillips skincare brushes that I previously owned. Skincare is a great product, but I&rsquo;m not happy with this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-ok-it-doesn-t-brush-your-teeth-just">its ok, it doesn&rsquo;t brush your teeth, just &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>its ok ,it doesn&rsquo;t brush your teeth , just vibrates .</p>
