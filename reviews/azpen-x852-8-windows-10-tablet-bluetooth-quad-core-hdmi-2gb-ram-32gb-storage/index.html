<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="cheap-tech-has-come-a-long-way">Cheap Tech has come a LONG way!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try not to over-hype this product. That said, I love it.I&rsquo;m a techie that owns a high spec gaming computer, an HP Specter x360, and an iPhone 6s. Needless to say I am used to speed and high quality with my devices, so I was nervous/skeptical about my expectations being too high for this product. Why buy this gadget, you ask? Well I also own a Galaxy Tab S 8.4 from years ago, and have since decided I don&rsquo;t prefer Android on my mobile devices. Enter this tablet.I did not want to spring hundreds of dollars for an iPad, and like I said Android was out of the question. There are many Windows tablets but I needed something relatively cheap. For the specs, this seemed like a good choice.My criteria? Around $100, Windows 10. That&rsquo;s it. However, let me uncover the pro&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve discovered while using this tablet for the first few hours.Full size USB meaning that for how portable this thing is, you can still easily pop a flash drive into it for file transfer, in sticky situations when you don&rsquo;t have a USB cord, PC, or laptop at the moment. This is a huge pro for this tablet, giving it more of a computer&rsquo;s functionality.Build quality. Is it high end aluminum? No, but it is well built, nice rubbered back texture that feels great to hold, and the chassis is sturdy with a nice heft that actually makes it feel like a real device, not just a toy. The design is clean, too.The screen. At only 1280x800, I was worried about its quality but wow! It&rsquo;s sharp, has a very very nice range of brightness with the highest setting actually very bright, and great color saturation. Viewing angles are good. Videos look great on it, and it is responsive!Speed. Now, pay very close attention to this part. This tablet is fast if you know how to use it. If you want a fast tablet that doesn&rsquo;t need mindful effort to keep it fast, sorry but go buy an iPad or high end Android tablet. Those are made for the mainstream consumer. However, if you know a little something about how technology works or how Windows works, you will like this tablet:It has 2gb of RAM so obviously running many apps and Windows will slow this down. However, basic and light multi tasking is recommended and works well on this tablet. Don&rsquo;t use Chrome on this, because Chrome is a memory hog. I can watch Netflix while having Reddit and email up, while downloading from the Windows store just fine. However, 15 Chrome tabs with videos and PhotoShop in the background is not going to happen. Also, turn off screen rotation when you don&rsquo;t need it to take the burden off the CPU.Get the point?The battery. I don&rsquo;t know what to compare the battery to, but I can get about five hours of combined browsing and video playback time. It charges relatively quickly. It is definitely a sufficient battery for media consumption. I have yet to test standby time.This tablet is such a great middle man between a laptop and desktop. You&rsquo;ve got a workstation desktop for your work, and a laptop for portability. But what about media consumption while having the ability to type a quick document, upload to Dropbox/drive, or transfer files from USB without doing it all on a 4inch phone screen? This is where this tablet comes in, and it does a damn good job.If you&rsquo;re like me and you plan to use this thing for Netflix, Email, Reddit, Facebook, file management, and such, buy it. If you want this for a main workhorse, look somewhere else.$100 tech has come such a long way. I could not imagine buying this product for any less than $250 five years ago.Is it perfect? Heck no, but it is damn good and I smile every time I pick it up knowing it only cost me a dollar short of a Benjamin.<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> worth the price tag. I will edit this review if I have complaints later on.This whole review was typed on the Aspen X852.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good value. Loaded up with full MS Office 2016, including skype. Was able to drive a long skype web conference from the hotel. Got the Damark bluetooth keyboard and they sync flawlessly, also a bluetooth mouse. Decent battery life. Really like all the inputs, such as hdmi and the full size usb. You can see in photo the larger screen. Should be good road tech.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-movies-bad-for-internet-use">Good for movies, bad for internet use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking forward to being able to watch movie and transfer files over from my computer. Since this uses Windows 10, the transition to using this while traveling was very easy. I especially like that it has the full size USB.Update: In terms of watching movies through a movie player, this product works great and that is actually what I had purchased it for. However as I have discovered later, if you plan on using the internet for email, watching videos or even a task as simple as using your personal face pages, this tablet is terrible at those things. The loading of web pages is ridiculously slow, mush slower than my last tablet which was 5 years old and designed for reading. I refuse to believe that it would be slow internet because my other tablet, 3 laptops and 2 desktops, all seem to work fine on the very same network. While I will keep it because it does the job I had originally purchased it for with movies on long trips. I will only rate it 3 stars, because I can not even use it the once or twice to check my email, requiring me to carry both tablets with me on trips.</p>

<h5 id="the-tablet-computer-that-dell-does-not-want-you-to-buy">The Tablet Computer that Dell Does Not Want You to Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of computer that Windows 8 was envisioned for and at this low price point, I don&rsquo;t care so much if it gets damaged or destroyed and thus I am willing to do more things with it than I would do with a $2500 laptop or a $500 phone. For instance, I use it at the gym to read technical manuals but it is just as good for browsing the web on the go or watching a video in bed.This product delivers a huge value for its price because the designers have made good decisions in terms of what trade-off(s) to make between cost and various sorts of performance. Instead of an expensive USB-C or Apple connection, it has a USB 2.0 port, a micro USB port, a micro HDMI port and a headphone jack. The USB-C could do all of those with one port if you buy expensive dongles, but you can plug this tablet into just about anything and it will work. A 2-in-1 computer might cost $700 and look real spiffy, but you can upgrade this $100 computer with a wireless mouse and keyboard for around $30 and then it is a &ldquo;mini-laptop.&rdquo; Plug it into a flat screen TV or computer monitor and it is a &ldquo;mini-desktop&rdquo;. Pricey phones and tablets have many more pixels, but the screen resolution is adequate for most purposes, and with fewer pixels to push, you get faster responsiveness. No, it is not particularly sleek or thin, and doesn&rsquo;t quite rest as well in my fingers as a $250 Nexus 7 tablet, but if you show up with one at a hackathon it will stand out in a sea of Macs. Windows 10 means you can use most sorts of desktop software, under the constraint that the machine has a modest amount of memory and storage. Phones come with much higher-spec cameras on the front and back, while the two HD cameras take great pictures under bright light. It skips the GPS from the Nexus 7, which is a loss, but they save a lot on the bill of materials and pass the savings on to you.The sharpest bit of that compromise is that nearly half of the 32GB of flash storage on this machine is already full when you get this machine; Windows is bigger than iOS or Android, but it does more. Although the remaining 16GB could hold a few movies, a season from a television show, office files, a lot of music and some work files, this is much less than the 512GB of storage you would find on a $200 laptop. However, this tablet&rsquo;s flash storage is dramatically faster than the mechanical hard drive on a computer, so it feels more responsive than computers that cost many times more.Don&rsquo;t like that? (1) You can be disciplined and only store the files you need, avoid installing a large number of bulky programs. (2) You can add an extra 64GB with a MicroSD card for $25 or so and (3) You can plug in a USB stick or external hard drive.</p>

<p>Love this tablet, easily the best price too. With a full free MS Office suite, Bluetooth keyboard, and HDMI cable it quickly becomes a workstation in your hotel room on the go. Sturdy construction and solid hardware makes this purchase a no-brainer for the customer not looking to drop a Grand on a slew of comparable Apple products.</p>
