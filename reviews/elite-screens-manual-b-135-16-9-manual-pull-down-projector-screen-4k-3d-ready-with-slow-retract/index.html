<h5 id="id-really-like-to-give-it-more-stars-but">Id really like to give it more stars but&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Id really like to give it more stars, I mean it pulls down and rolls up and the image looks goods on it quality wise. HOWEVER&hellip;.right out of the box the screen has a V wave in it starting from the bottom center and going up each side to the corners. When an image pans across it right you will see that wave in the image. Distracting and unsightly! Even when doing stuff in the projector menu the menu has a wave in it. I have contacted elite screens via their website and a week later still have not received a response. So not only is the screen poor quality customer service is not all that good either. Be sure to Google V wave in pull down screen and you will see what im talking about.I really really want to like it but for me the wave in it throws off the viewing experience..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="had-it-for-a-week-or-more-now">Had it for a week or more now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice screen. So far we haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it. Other than the smell when you first open it. If you&rsquo;re really sensitive to odors I would highly suggest cracking a few windows and leaving the screen open until it goes away. We left it open for a few hours our first night and by the next night the smell was almost completely gone. This was a very nice upgrade from our smaller screen that was on a tripod. Worth the money for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-flat-distortion-during-panning-shots-games-also-avoid-for-short-throw-projectors">Not flat - distortion during panning shots / games. Also, avoid for short-throw projectors!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Missed the little warning about short-throw projectors&hellip; wish I hadn&rsquo;t. Even with a relatively horizontal projection path, the waves on the screen are distracting and ugly. The housing and screen material seem fine, everything works as described.Docking two stars: One for not making that short-throw warning more prominent (and more clear - &ldquo;not recommended&rdquo; is not strong enough wording). Another because, regardless of it&rsquo;s intended use, the screen is not anywhere near flat. Even when projecting straight onto the surface, these waves cause annoying distortions during panning shots or when playing games.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen-for-the-price">Great screen for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really pleased with this screen so far. I bought it for an outdoor pool party this summer, along with a cheap $150 DVD quality projector. I wasn&rsquo;t going for anything high end, just something to play some music videos on while the party was going on. After the pool party I also put some hooks in the ceiling in my kids&rsquo; room (ages 2 and 4), and they love having little movie nights with huge movies playing in their room. It is a good distraction for them, especially when we have multiple families over with lots of kids, as they can have their own little movie room going separate from the adults.It is light and easy to move around between the two spots that I installed hooks, although I am 6&rsquo;1&rdquo; so that helps. My screen is pretty smooth and flat, I have to look very closely to find any kind of waves as others have reported. I guess each screen can be different, but I am happy with the one I got. Unless I look from the side with a light source at an angle, I can&rsquo;t see any waves. I certainly don&rsquo;t have any waves that I can notice looking straight at the screen or while watching a video, and after 6 months haven&rsquo;t noticed any changes. Maybe if I had a high end projector and this was my main source of tv or movie watching, then I would invest in a more expensive screen to be certain I had a very flat surface, but for my casual use this screen works great. It rolls up and down very smoothly, but makes sure to assist it back up and not let it go, or it will retract very quickly and violently. It does have the very strong &ldquo;chemical&rdquo; smell the first few days, but it has gone away now and I don&rsquo;t smell anything even using it indoors.Overall a very solid screen for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen">Great screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is great! If you&rsquo;re a first time buyer like I am I would totally recommend getting this screen. When I received it, it came in 2 different boxes. The first box was damaged like something poked it and the 2nd box inside it was undamaged. When I took the the screen out of the second box it was in perfect condition. When i pulled the screen out it had no waves or wrinkles like others have said but just like some other reviews state it does have a smell to it when you pull the screen out but it has dissipated after time. So if you are looking for a beginner screen I would recommend this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy">Happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent screen! We did the warehouse deal and got an even better price. Heavier than it looks. I would not leave it outdoors for an extended period of time. Great picture. This is not our first Elite screen and we have been very happy with the quality and durability of their brand of screens. And the price is fair. Definitely retracts slow and looks almost like it&rsquo;s electric! Solid housing. Good buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-drop-in-quality-is-more-extreme-than-expected">The drop in quality is more extreme than expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have ordered more expensive screens from this manufacturer in the past, and have been very happy with them. I bought this one for my brother expecting the main difference to be the quality of the screen itself (as suggested in the description), but the casing is significantly smaller, the metal of the casing is very thin, and the screen will not lock in place. It is unusable.You might get lucky if you take a chance on this one, but after seeing the quality of their cheaper units, you might want to spend the extra twenty-five dollars. Unless this is representative of the quality of all lines now, in which case I&rsquo;d have to recommend trying another manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen-1">Great screen,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>needed a screen for outdoor movies for a party and contemplated getting one of those cheap $40 vinyl screens that would have come folded up and necessitating making some sort of frame, but decided to spend a little more and get this one and i&rsquo;m glad i did, it came very well packaged. i hung it from a couple hooks outside, the screen is a very bright, almost sparkly white with a black border and made my budget projector show a really nice picture, the screen retracts very slowly - which is not a bad thing, almost seems motorized. i highly recommend it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-screen-best-value-on-internet-works-great-easy-to-open-and-close-works-slowly-which-is-nice">Great screen, best value on internet, works great, easy to open and close (works slowly which is nice)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great screen, great value, maybe should have purchase a electrical unit, but simple to open and close. Easy to install, and best value on the internet. great service</p>

<h5 id="screen-didn-t-roll-up-returned-second-one-works-well">Screen didn&rsquo;t roll up - returned - second one works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had to return the first one because the screen wouldn&rsquo;t roll up. Yes, I read the re-tension instructions and performed them 3 times, still wouldn&rsquo;t roll up.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-mount-crystal-clear-high-end-video">easy to mount- crystal clear high end video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfection, easy to mount- crystal clear high end video. If picture isn&rsquo;t perfect, question your projector and not the screen</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-not-completely-flat">Its not completely flat&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess ok for the price. The screen is not completely flat. It appears to be warped. This does become annoying during certain scenes of a movie since you can clearly see a wave&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="way-bigger-than-i-thought">Way bigger than I thought</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My only problem is that I think it said that it was 100 inches measured like a TV and I think it&rsquo;s 100 inches measured straight across the top so be careful when you order cuz&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad for the price you pay. The delivery came as expected. Great screen!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="alright-cheaper-option-for-a-screen-but-mine-has">Alright cheaper option for a screen, but mine has &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Alright cheaper option for a screen, but mine has a lot of bumps and wrinkles in it that make the image warp sometimes when the camera pans. Mine also doesn&rsquo;t roll up evenly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install, its also great that it slowly retracts. Movies on this screen look great. Highly recommended</p>
