<h5 id="well-made-case-space-configuration-is-somewhat-adaptable">Well made case, space configuration is somewhat adaptable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a small GoPro Hero 3+ case that holds the camera plus a reasonable number of accessories. Trouble is, all the units that are purpose-built for the job come with very specific organizational schemes. Here, the manufacturer built this to hold the camera, two spare batteries, the wifi remote and the LCD back. Of course, like many people I have no use for that particular layout - my iPhone acts as both remote and screen, and I simply don&rsquo;t need 3 batteries just yet. What I do need is space for a different back, some mount accessories, etc.Well, the good news is that the foam liner is easily adjustable, after which the small case holds a lot of stuff nearly and without squeezing or undue rattling about. I uploaded two pictures to this product page on Amazon to show the modified innards empty AND filled with gear, to give you an idea what you could do with your own kit. With these caveats, highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-gopro-case">Wonderful GoPro Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After buying my GoPro I then had to decide on a case since there are so many different attachments and accessories to go with it. After much research I decided on the CamKix since it gets great reviews and there are several options. I bought the large case since I figured too big was better than getting a smaller one and then not having enough room.The case is very solid and appears to be strong but it&rsquo;s not like solid plastic so it&rsquo;s not heavy. The zipper which has two pulls goes around three sides of the case and works very smooth. The hinged area appears to be nylon and well sewn. When you open the case one half is filled completely with hundreds of little pieces of foam all attached lightly together, the other half has two pockets. If you push around on the foam with your finger you can better see the size and number of the individual pieces.Then comes the decision just how to pull out all the right pieces so all your items fit snuggly into the foam. I began with laying everything I have for my GoPro on the table and then started placing them on the foam in various configurations until it appeared I could make all items fit.In the beginning I did draw around objects but then realized if I just pulled out a few pieces at a time, rechecked, and then pulled out a few more until I was able to customize each area for the individual component worked great. I also realized early on that using a pair of needle nose pliers work better than big fingers, especially if you only need to remove small numbers of foam at a time. Each foam piece is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo;x3/8&rdquo;x1&rdquo; deep so it is very possible to make exactly the right opening for any item. There is a solid ½&rdquo; wide border of foam all the way around the outside edge so you will always have a nice perimeter cushion.When I was finished I was able to get these items in my CamKix Large case:GoPro Hero 4 Silver in standard housingDual battery chargerTelescoping poleMini flexible tripod2 extra back doors1 extra lens6 various mounting piecesThumb screw wrenchMicro SDHC card adaptorIn the two inside pockets I put:The original flat mount the camera came attached to in the box2 adhesive mountsLens cleaning clothUSB cableGoPro owner&rsquo;s manualAnti-fog insertsEverything fits nice and snug and the top closes and zips with no extra effort confirming the case is not over packed. Since there is a gap inside between the top and bottom when the lid is closed it seems like things could come out of place but I have not experienced this.I think the only con I can find is the carrying handle, maybe an optional shoulder strap would be nice. That would free up your hands to shoot videos which this is all about anyway.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-construction-the-ability-to-completely-tailor-the-case">Wonderful construction. The ability to completely tailor the case &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful construction. The ability to completely tailor the case to my needs was exactly what I needed. Check out my photo with the GoPro and Feiyu-tech 3 axis gimbal. Really cool carrying case. highly recommended! Also, the customer service is top notch. He emailed me multiple times to make sure I was happy with the purchase.</p>

<h5 id="great-box-for-more-than-just-gopros">Great box for more than just GoPros</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t limit this case to just your GoPro. My (quite expensive) work glasses- loupes need a cushioned case to protect the frames, lenses, and magnifiers. My case broke and that is a big problem. I looked up the OEM box- 50 bux. I had gotten a CamKix case before for my GoPro, and knew I could make a custom case that would be more useful and cheaper than the box my loupes rode in on. Ordered the medium size case along with the customizable foam block and voilà, 28 bux later, I have a case that fits not only my loupes, but also my plain safety glasses, pens, vending machine money and pens. There is still a bit of space leftover that I haven&rsquo;t figured out how I will use, or if I even will. My coworkers are already interested in copying my idea.Check out the attached pics.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-go-to-gopro-case">Perfect go to GoPro case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is well built, the outer covering tight and the zippers sturdy. The interior padding, high density foam, comes out, making it easy to push out the cutouts to customize your case. It measures roughly 9.5 x 7.5 x 3 inches, not large enough to carry all your accessories, but for packing and protecting what you need, it&rsquo;s perfect. The orange is great, you can identify your camera bag immediately, not your boring black. Based on the quality of this piece, I&rsquo;d buy from this company again without hesitation.</p>
