<h5 id="a-poem-about-a-fan">A poem about a fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite a large man, my temperature&rsquo;s hotMy blood boils and churns like a cast iron potThe last fan I had, made hardly a breezeAs sweat pools collected and I smelled like wet cheeseIt made lots of noise and drowned out all soundWhile meanwhile a sweat pool dripped onto the groundI could no longer take it, my face was on fire!I felt like a bonfire that was fed with a tireSo I looked up this fan, It had good reviewsAnd it could ship quickly (really good news)It came in the mail and I plugged it right inAnd felt the cool breeze make its way to my skinI was cool! I was comfy! My attitude shiftedI felt like a schoolbus or house could be liftedSo if you are warm, or got forbid hotPLEASE BUY THIS FAN, it&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve got.</p>

<h5 id="little-fan-moves-a-ton-of-air">Little fan moves a ton of air!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I bought this fan because our house does not have good circulation unless we are running the central air. We can open all the windows and air still doesn&rsquo;t seem to move. My wife and I also have a challenge because I need moving air to sleep and she cannot have any moving air or she gets an ear ache and headache! I read a little about air circulators and how they can move air around a room effectively, so I thought for $14 bucks I would make a minimal investment and give this a try. I found out very quickly that this tiny little fan can really move the stale air with very little noise. When I started it up on high speed, it didn&rsquo;t feel like it was moving a very impressive amount of air close up, but as I moved away 5, 10, 15, and 20 feet it seemed as if there was a concentrated cylinder of air moving in a vortex of sorts. I was pretty amazed. I placed this on the floor in the corner of our bedroom and aimed it at the ceiling toward the opposite corner of the room. It really moved the air around the room nicely without the violent blowing and noise of a box fan. For me, the moving indirect air is enough to keep me sleeping comfortably through the night and I hope that this indirect air doesn&rsquo;t end up giving my wife ear aches over the long haul. I have to believe this fan uses far less energy than the huge box fans that are clumsy and inefficient. I&rsquo;m sold on air circulators, and will probably pick up a few more for other rooms in the house. If this review, photos and video helped you, please let me know by clicking &ldquo;YES&rdquo; below. Thanks so much!PROS: moves a big vortex of air like I didn&rsquo;t expect, quiet, energy efficientCONS: NoneUPDATE: Because I was so satisfied with this product and its low price, I went and purchased a 2nd air circulator.</p>

<h5 id="surprisingly-sturdy-quiet">Surprisingly sturdy, quiet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Executive summary: In this review I compare 3 fans, including this one.With the prospect of the coming summer and living in an apartment not suitable for window A/C units and a deficient central A/C which the landlord refuses to fix, I geared up by buying an array of fans. In the following paragraphs I compare them in terms of power usage, perceived noise, perceived air circulation and overall functionality. All of them were tested on a 150sq ft living room on a 30c/85f degree day.Overall:Lasko 1827 - pedestal with 18 in blades: This is a big and powerful fan. The swivel function does a great job at circulating air from the only window in the apartment. The burst of air, even at the lowest setting are noticeable from a 5m/15ft distance and we could feel &ldquo;air circulation&rdquo; throughout the whole room. Unfortunately it feels cheaply made and is very noisy, unable to sleep.Vornado 683 - pedestal with 11 in blades: This fan is well built and surprisingly powerful for its size. Even though, you could feel good breeze if you stood in front of it, we could not replicate the claim of &ldquo;whole room air circulation&rdquo;. Since it doesn&rsquo;t swivel, if you were outside of the range of direct air, we couldn&rsquo;t feel any air. Additionally, it was a little shorter than anticipated and would not fit well in front of the window. The worst part was that it was really noisy and we couldn&rsquo;t keep it on overnight.Honeywell HT-900 - floor with 9 in blades: This wan was a very pleasant surprise. Very cheap but feels well built and despite not being as powerful as the other two, since it draws less energy and makes virtually no noise, we opted to fill the room with 3 of these which we keep at around 3m/9ft blowing air directly at the lowest setting. Best setup for sleeping.Details (the 3 numbers for each fan and metric correspond to the 3 power settings).Power drawn (beasured using a TP-link HS110 smart plug):Lakso: 85/73/63wVornado: 60/45/40wHonwywell: 25/23/21wNoise (measured with an unreliable phone app, from behing the fan)Lakso: 60/55/50dbVornado: 45/40/35dbHoneywell: 40/36/34dbFinal veredict: We returned the Vornado and for the same price we have the Lakso which we setup in front of the window before goingto bed and the 4 small Honeywel for &ldquo;whole room air circulation&rdquo;,1-3 of which we keep overnight or on timer (with the TP-link smart plug)</p>

<h5 id="excellent-fan-with-a-single-glaring-con-for-those-young-at-heart">Excellent fan with a single glaring con,for those young at heart</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>let me start off by saying this: Before this fan I was sweating enough to get us out of the California drought. With this fan now I am cool as a cucumber I have not drippity drop dropped a single sweat in my room ever since I plopped this puppy on my desk.BUT..I cannot talk into the fan and distort my voice which really let down my inner 6 year old self.Still 5 stars, but for those of you looking to distort your voice by speaking into your new beloved table fan, look elsewhere. If the above doesn&rsquo;t apply to you stop reading this nonsense and buy the thing already!</p>

<h5 id="turboforce-doesn-t-say-it-right-turbohurricane-maybe">&ldquo;TurboForce&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t say it right&hellip; &ldquo;TurboHurricane&rdquo;, maybe?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be realistic: when you buy a fan, you want it to move the air. This beauty does it IN SPADES! Even on low, it is still pushing quite a bit of air and does so relatively quietly. I set it up a few feet from my bed thinking it was &ldquo;enough&rdquo;. Wrong. It&rsquo;s almost too much, and from me, that&rsquo;s saying something. If I lay with my back to it (like I normally would) there is enough wind going past my ears that IT MAKE A SOUND - yes, literally the wind rushing past my ear. And that&rsquo;s on low from 3 feet away! &hellip; Frankly, I LOVE IT! I have had too many little fans that just couldn&rsquo;t live up to the task. But this little jewel does EXACTLY what it is supposed to do. But be advised, it makes noise. Especially on high. This is a FAN! And I am a FAN of this fan!</p>
