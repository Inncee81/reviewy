<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="happy-with-my-purchase-thanks-amazon">Happy With My Purchase, Thanks Amazon!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this fan back in 2012 and it worked Great for 4 years and then it died, so when I search on Amazon I was So happy to find it and I Grab it before it sold out at a price you cannot find any where else. The Remote is my main concern, I am Disabled and I need to use it when I need to turn off or turn it down..etc. without getting out of the bed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="twin-window-fan">Twin Window Fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made solid product. Very pleased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-fan">Love this fan!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this fan for about a week and so far loving it. I&rsquo;m really liking the dual intake and outgo circulation feature. Both blades run independently and simultaneously. It&rsquo;s great having the remote control which I can operate during the night from my bed during the night.5/19/17 (a year later): This fan is still going strong. I like it so much, I&rsquo;ve purchased a second fan for another room. Does a great job of circulating and moving the air to keep my apartment comfortable. Really helps to keep the cost of running the a/c down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-nice-enough-for-the-money">Its nice enough for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only time this is a little loud is when i put it on high. I wish it had a button that controls intake &amp; exhaust because its a little cumbersome to keep taking it out of the window for whichever way i want the air to flow. Its nice enough for the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quietly-does-its-job">Quietly does its job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan is surprisingly quiet on the two lower speeds and moves a good bit of air. It&rsquo;s lightweight, but seems sturdy enough. Despite the manufacturer&rsquo;s claims, it will not fit a 36-inch window. Even in my 34-inch window, there are small gaps at each end. The maximum opening it will actually span is about 33 inches. The remote is easier to use than the push buttons, which are the same color as the surrounding plastic and hard to see. With such a reasonable price, it seems like a bargain to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-cheap-but-there-are-worse">It is cheap but there are worse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes this is a cheap manufactured fan. It does tend to make a lot of noise. However I have had much thinner walled fans then this. So if it lasts a year I am fine with that. This fan has a remote control with I will not live without. It could use a thermostat so I don&rsquo;t have to wake up and turn the fan down or off or change the direction of wind flow. As others have mentioned it is a loud fan, but at it lowest setting it moves more air then other fans at their high setting. The sound does not bother me, it creates a white noise that blocks out the traffic, train and bar sounds from just outside my window. It does tend to have an annoying rattle to it most likely a barring issue since the plastic fan blades are very thin and cheap the both are not round. So this may kill the motor faster then it should. It installs easy, but this make speak more to the flimsy body then intentional engineering. Would I buy one again. I don&rsquo;t know. If this is the only reasonably priced fan with a remote control maybe I would. If it lasts a year I will be surprised. This fan should be considered disposable. There are reports of noise coming from the electronics. I doubt this as there is nothing in the electronics that would tend to make noise. And how could you tell with the sounds from the out of round fan blades and the sound of moving air.03/13/2015: Update - While the fan continues to make the same amount of noise. It has ran well past the year I thought it would die. As to the rattling sounds, for me this is just white noise that blocks out the road and train traffic. If it lasts two years and I can not find a better fan that blows this much air, that has a remote control I would buy another.</p>

<h5 id="2016-for-our-window-as-a-means-of-pulling-cool-air-into-our-room-beyond-just-having-the-window">&hellip; 2016 for our window as a means of pulling cool air into our room beyond just having the window &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this fan in May 2016 for our window as a means of pulling cool air into our room beyond just having the window cracked whether we were pulling the cool air in from outside during the colder May and June nights in the California desert or just aiding our evaporative (swamp) cooler in cooling our room off. This fan really helped a significant amount to draw the cool air from our evaporative (swamp) cooler into our room by means of venting the air out all summer long even when the outside temp was reaching or beyond <sup>115</sup>&frasl;<sub>120</sub> f all summer. Kept room at least 15 to 25 degrees cooler than the previous years, where normally we&rsquo;d be a little stifling because of the room being a mid day to afternoon sun facing room, this room is nearly always hotter than the rest of the house.Sadly the lower fan (the one that changes directions on circulate) stopped working today exactly 4 months after purchase. I took it apart, oiled it with WD40 on both the front and back bearing and had it spinning without problem but the motor itself had died. Great product, perhaps not meant to deal with the heavy dust that the desert is inclined to have.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-decent-fan-that-fits-the-window-well">A decent fan that fits the window well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted this fan for my garage primarily as an exhaust fan. It does a pretty good job but it is noisy even on the lowest setting. It is easy to set in the window and seals in pretty good. If there is no screen the seal won&rsquo;t keep many bugs out, but it fits behind the screen in my window and does fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fan">Great fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was hesitate to buy this fan cause it got mixed reviews. But it was on sale so I said why not. This fan is awesome. I blows in fresh air nicely and cools down the room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fan-1">Great Fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great fan. Just in time for our heat in California. Works great. Not to noisy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-item-for-windows-installs-easily-power-is-adequate">Good item for windows, installs easily, power is adequate.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very worthwhile at the price and easy to use with its remote and electronic reversing fans.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-work">Did not work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Box had been previously opened and one of the fans did not work. Was able to return with no problem and no cost (Prime members)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolute best window fan I&rsquo;ve ever purchased!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-impressed">Not impressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The fan functions but the air flow at the hi speed doesn&rsquo;t seem hi enough for me. I guess it maybe becuz the slats aren&rsquo;t adjustable to direct the wend flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="short-life-span">Short life span</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When this fan is working properly, it&rsquo;s a pretty good fan. Lightweight, and moves a lot of air. However, I am here posting this review exactly one year after I bought the fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">DON&rsquo;T BUY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy!! Day one, loud hum, Day two, one motor started to make noise. Day three, returned</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The motor is too small to feel no wind</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="save-your-money">Save your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a very sturdy or powerful fan. Ours stopped working after a year. Pay a little more and get something better.</p>
