<h5 id="works-completely-fine">Works Completely Fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, this speaker isn’t something that will be able to rival something that’s a lot bigger and more expensive (at least 3 times expensive) in sound quality. That said, here’s some sound specifications:• Bass is better than a smartphone’s speaker but isn’t its strongpoint• Lots of treble• Mids are hard to define• Gets pretty loud to overcome the sound of the shower but not too blisteringly loudI’ve used this speaker for the past week in the shower and yes it has lasted sprinkles of water like a champ. The speaker can simply stick to my glass really well but it usually falls from it after consecutive days in the shower which is the case for most suction cup items in my bathroom.Other aesthetics of this speaker include the grill and the light ring around the speaker that constantly breaths different colors on and off, being made of rubber all the way around with rubber buttons that are tactile, and a removable suction cup.Overall, for the price, sound and IP67 certification, this speaker is on par with a lot of speakers with its similar design out in the market today. The only apparent difference I can compare this to others is its lights. Otherwise, it’s a great shower speaker like most today.</p>

<h5 id="5-stars">5 stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! Real waterproof and powerful base.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waterproof-bluetooth-speaker">Waterproof bluetooth speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the uniqueness of this speaker because of its suction cup and since this speaker is waterproof, I can stick it to any tiled or glassed surface in my shower room to play my music while showering or shaving. Very convenient. I am having fun listening to its superb high definition stereo sound. This speaker pairs effortlessly with my iphone 6 plus bluetooth at “My Speaker F013”. When fully charged, I can play my internet music from Pandora or Slacker for 6 hours. Another feature that I like though, which I can’t find in many of the portable speakers in the market today, is its built in FM radio. This added feature gives me an alternative way of tuning to music radio even without my smartphone.</p>

<h5 id="small-package-that-packs-a-punch">Small package that packs a punch!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one powerful little speaker! With the market so flooded with Bluetooth speakers it&rsquo;s hard to know what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s not, and more importantly what will fit your needs.This speaker is definitely designed as a bathroom shower Bluetooth speaker, no question. However, it can be used anywhere. Due to its compact size and shape you can easily carry it with you on the go. The speaker is water resistant, while I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend dunking it under water, it will hold up to rain and humid bathroom conditions just fine. The construction of this speaker is excellent. The entire thing is made to be strong, and handle drops. It&rsquo;s covered in a rubberized texture also to help defend it from anything. It looks great, the color and the texture is great and stylish. It has RGB LEDs at the top that light up the entire speaker grill and the side ring. It just brings a second level of cool to the speaker. It also has a large suction cup at the base that holds to any smooth surface extremely well, especially the shower.And the big question how does it sound? Great. This is definitely one of the most well rounded bluetooth speakers I&rsquo;ve heard. The highs and mids are powerful, but the bass is strong and deep. You will be surprised at how good your music sounds coming out of this speaker. Not only that, but it gets very loud, about 3 times louder then my phone. This is a well rounded, good looking speaker that&rsquo;s good for much more than just the shower.</p>

<h5 id="good-sound-great-for-by-the-pool">Good sound - great for by the pool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this speaker primarily based upon the reviews: Shower Speaker, IP67 Waterproof Portable Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Speakers with Super Bass and HD Sound, Perfect Speaker for Beach, Pool, Kitchen &amp; Home by BassPal.I wanted a speaker my grand-kids could use out by the pool and listen to music while frolicking in the pool. While when I searched for a waterproof speaker others were less expensive – I kept coming back to this one as it received 5 stars. I must say that I am glad I spent a little extra money and purchased this one as it is wonderful. My grand-kids love it – their parents love that they don’t have to worry it getting wet and their expensive phone they use to stream the music can be safely up on a table. The sound is much better on the pool deck – when it’s floating, unless the water is still, it is muffled. A great purchase for worry-free listening enjoyment!</p>

<h5 id="love-this-waterproof-speaker">Love This Waterproof Speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been wanting a waterproof speaker for a while for my shower and I really wanted one for my pool this summer. I am very impressed as I received it today and decided to go with the gray and the lights make it so pretty! You can press the off/on button and have it set on one specific color, you can set it to multi colors or turn the colors off. The sound is great and it has a built-in microphone for calls, which is a plus when you&rsquo;re in the water! It is shockproof, dustproof, and scratchproof. When you charge it up the lights will turn off when it has a full charge.You can change it to Bluetooth or FM radio and I shall stick with Bluetooth because I can&rsquo;t get any stations where I live because it is in the middle of nowhere! It has a great suction cup but unfortunately will not stick to my shower because of the texture it has on it but I can sit it right in the shower and it is fine. I am glad that I purchased this for when I&rsquo;m in the pool I can sit in right on my float and won&rsquo;t have to worry about my phone slipping into the water. I&rsquo;m overall very happy with my purchase.The downside of this speaker is it cannot be exposed to excessive heat such as direct sunlight. Of course being in the pool it is going to be exposed to direct sunlight. So, I&rsquo;m going to have to make sure it is covered up with a rag or something while using it in the pool. Also, make sure that the charging port is completely closed before getting it close to water because it will ruin it! Other than the minor things I really like the speaker.</p>
