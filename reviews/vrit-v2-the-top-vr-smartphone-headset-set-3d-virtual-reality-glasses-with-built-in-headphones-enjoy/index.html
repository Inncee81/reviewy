<h5 id="the-kids-love-this-headset">The kids love this headset!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have had the VR headset for a few days. My boys love this headset! I am not a tech savvy person but once I opened the box and downloaded some VR apps on the phone we were using the headset in minutes. My boys love the ocean, nature and rollercoaster apps. We are looking forward to all the possibilities this headset will bring us in the VR world. This has very popular with all the friends that have been at the house. I&rsquo;m considering getting another so my boys can use at the same time with our phones. Great product. Easy to use and the lens is excellent</p>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great Purchase!</h5>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheaply-made-not-good-for-samsung-s">Cheaply made not good for Samsung&rsquo;s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Samsung S5 which is right at the average size for this viewer.However its does not fit well.There is no way to center the phone to ensure adjustments work I found I had to over and over open the case to adjust the phoneto center it so the phones adjustments would work.Over view:The headphones work well and are the best part of this model however for the steep price it should come with a remote.The cheaper model they sell does but has no headphones seems the manufactures is clueless what is needed in a viewer like this.The adjustments are toy like they are clumsy and clunky now smoothness really bad you can feel the gears grind as they try and adjust.The unit looks attractive and at first glance looks impressive however the use is pretty bad those giving a higher rating have to be fakesas this is not fantastic or amazing. The sound is good real good and headphones feel nice if only that quality that went into headphones went into the rest of it it would be great. The clip that hold the catch to hold the door closed for the phone wil break its cheap think plastic and wont last.The head gear adjusts well though and is comfortable to wear. The lenses are very cheap and look scratched taking away from what will be HD/VR viewing for most.Pros:Nice and comfy to wear.Cool looking.Good headphones.Cons:Clumsy Bulky controlsPoorly built lenses.No way to center phone so contract manual adjustment is needed.No remote even though cheaper model they sell comes with one.Over priced for the quality.No doubt will break easily is made of toy grade plastic.</p>
