<h5 id="one-of-my-favorite-open-world-games">One of my favorite open world games</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I say other than this game is one of my favorites in my modest collection of games?I&rsquo;ve only played GTA 4 and 5, but the first time I played 5, I admit I was a little hesitant. I had come off right from finishing 4, and my mind and heart were still with those characters in Liberty City, it almost felt fake to come here to Los Santos. I played these games on the PS3, so I played the prologue of GTA 5 and then took a break for awhile. After coming back after maybe a year, my perspective had totally changed. I&rsquo;d missed the GTA world, and it was exciting for me to try new content. This time I had it for the PS4 and immediately my reaction was insanely more positive. Maybe it was just the graphics that bothered me the first time around, but this time that I played it was truly uplifting for me.The game centers around Franklin, Michael, and Trevor: a small time hustler, retired bank robber, and a deranged, trigger-happy guy respectively, who eventually find their way together and use their criminal cunning to fight for their freedom. It&rsquo;s an open world with a thoroughly engaging story line that had me enticed all the way to the very end. You get to switch between all three characters, doing missions and side quests to further you along the game. It took me awhile to finish my first play through, and when I wanted a break from the main story, there were plenty of Strangers and Freaks side missions to do where you help out (or con out) some pretty interesting people, along with random events that occur around town where you can cash in for a quick buck or play hero to some helpless civilian. My favorites are the collectibles, where you have to collect spaceship parts or letter scraps; finding all of them unlocks a unique Strangers and Freaks mission. Even after you finish the game, there&rsquo;s still plenty to do. I&rsquo;m currently trying to get to 100% game play and that in itself is packed full of checks you have to get through on the checklist. It&rsquo;s enough to keep you occupied for months.The characters were pretty solid, the main characters anyway. Trevor is by far the most entertaining of the three with his general wackiness and psychopathic tendencies. Depending on your tastes, the events and dialogue centered around him are incredibly humorous and never fail to make me laugh. The graphics and driving are so much smoother than on the PS3, making the driving sometimes sensitive if you&rsquo;re used to the rough turns on its predecessor.GTA 5 is definitely worth the buy if you don&rsquo;t want to finish a game in a couple settings. The world is vast and full of goodies, like armor and ammo just lying around in the woods or underwater, so you can&rsquo;t go wrong there. With the PS4 version of the game, there are perks for returning PS3 players who played GTA 5 on there first, like exclusive weapons and missions. So, even if you already have the PS3 version, getting the PS4 version would not be a bad idea!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic game. The gameplay is completely revamped and is more fluid than anything I&rsquo;ve ever played. The ps4 version graphics blow away the ps3 version graphics. In general a fantastic game.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-game-for-ps4-owners">Must Have Game for PS4 Owners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are some games that I buy and then trade-in two months later. This game is definitely not one of those games. If you own a PlayStation 4, you should own Grand Theft Auto 5. The story mode is probably one of the best single-player campaigns that I&rsquo;ve ever played, and the online multiplayer (GTA Online) is everything that you wished it would be.</p>

<h5 id="huge-open-world-great-fun-amazing-game">Huge open world. Great fun, amazing game.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first time ever playing any of the GTA&rsquo;s&hellip; and what an impact it had on me! I was introduced to video games in the Atari era&hellip; at that time, we had to actually rely on our imaginations to experience a real &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; playing video games. After a long hiatus without playing video games, I fell in love with Doom on the PC&hellip; It was a whole new world to explore, but still very limited. Again, after a few years away from video games, I got a last gen console, and GTA 5. It completely blew my mind. The missions are fun, the driving around, shooting (except from moving vehicles - the only problem with it), flying&hellip; it&rsquo;s exhilarating. The fact that this huge world is completely open and free to roam around at will is just incredible, and a lot of fun. Sometimes I just want to climb a mountain and take in the sights&hellip; and other times, drive around causing lots of mayhem. The changing in weather, the day/night cycle make it a lot more interesting. Walking around, one can hear a multitude of sounds, from the wind, wildlife, people talking, vehicles&hellip; it&rsquo;s just amazing. Every time you log on to it, you can just roam around to relax, or engage in a serious mission&hellip; it&rsquo;s your choice. If you see something going on, like someone asking for help, by all means stop what you&rsquo;re doing and see what happens&hellip; it&rsquo;s always a lot of fun.Other people have told this already, but it&rsquo;s always good to remind: DO NOT give this game to your 10-12 year old as a gift; it&rsquo;s intended for adults only, really. Lots of violence, sex and some torture scenes inside. It&rsquo;s very realistic.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-buy-load-times-improved-over-last-gen">A must buy! Load times improved over last gen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much better then Xbox 360 version. I had the 360 version and I couldn&rsquo;t stand the load times. I quit playing the 360 version shortly after picking it up. It took forever to do anything, even the simplest things like entering stores or changing clothes took a long time to load. The graphics and load times are much improved on this PS4 version. The only delay I experienced when the game had to install for the first time. This game is a blast and a must buy!</p>
