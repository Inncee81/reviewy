<h5 id="good-until-it-breaks-and-then-they-decide-not-to-honor-the-warranty">Good until it breaks, and then they decide not to honor the warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second toothbrush from Sonicare and the first one lasted two years, and the second one lasted a year. Both times the battery just died and the toothbrush just stopped working altogether. I tried to get a replacement handle from Sonicare since it was still under the warranty for the second handle. This is why I&rsquo;m giving them two stars, it&rsquo;s because of their awful service in getting any replacement parts under the warranty. Sure, you think Sonicare is a great deal because they offer a two year warranty, but what&rsquo;s the point if they take their sweet time sending you, or rather, NEVER sending you the replacement part you need? It has been a month now for me and I have contacted them four times for a replacement part. I really don&rsquo;t know what to do at this point to get my replacement handle that is still well within the two year warranty. It&rsquo;s incredibly frustrating, especially since all I seem to get from them are excuses about my order. Is it really uncommon for them to actually fulfill a replacement order under warranty?So, beware, when you get your toothbrush. It may last you two years, or it may last you one year. When it works, it really is great. But if it breaks within your warranty period, expect a really long wait to get anything from them if at all. I&rsquo;m still trying to get them to send me something, but it&rsquo;s looking a bit hopeless at this point. I&rsquo;m really upset since the toothbrush and the heads are expensive, yet they are treating a loyal customer this way.</p>

<h5 id="the-battery-life-has-been-quite-good-as-well">The battery life has been quite good as well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush for a full two years now, and it has worked flawlessly.From a reliability standpoint, it has been completely trouble free. The battery life has been quite good as well, as I usually can go two weeks without needing to charge it.As far as functionality goes, here&rsquo;s what I like:-Built-in timer that gives you a precise two minute brushing session, as well as the ability to add 15 second extra cleaning sessions for your front teeth, top and bottom-Really penetrates the crevices and removes stuck food-Great job at removing stains from teeth, particularly in the back of your teeth, which can sometimes be neglected.-Light and easy to handle_______________________________The only con I would mention is that the brush heads wear out rather quickly and are not exactly cheap to replace. I would recommend the Diamond Clean heads over the Pro Results as they do a better job overall.This product really is worth the investment. You feel like you just left the dentist&rsquo;s office every time you use it. People really should spend the money to take care of their teeth. You only get one set, and dental problems later in life are not worth skimping out and buying a cheap 2 dollar manual toothbrush every other month.Highly recommend this product if you are looking to improve oral hygiene and want a quality device that&rsquo;s reliable and works effectively.</p>

<h5 id="great-electronic-toothbrush">Great electronic toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My previous electronic toothbrush was a Sonicare E-Series and I never liked how the brush accumulated all this gunk between the head and base. It was impossible to keep clean. My battery on the E-series died out and I decided to replace it with the Sonicare 710. I like the 710 better for several reasons. The toothbrush itself is less bulky, lighter and easier to hold. It also seems to be less noisy. In addition the head is easy to install (it snaps on) and it is very easy to clean between the head and base. The toothbrush comes with a &ldquo;clean and white&rdquo; feature which provides you with an extra 30 seconds to concentrate on the visible part of your front teeth. The one (minor) negative is that the charger does not include space to wrap the extra cord so if you like to keep the charger on your counter you will have a long cord that is always in the way. Fortunately the battery only needs to be charged every few weeks, so I keep my charger stored away until needed. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase an electronic toothbrush.</p>

<h5 id="flexcare-performance-at-a-lower-price">flexcare performance at a lower price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries on my old Sonicare Elite (E-series) died on me, so I decided to get a new one. The R710 has several incremental upgrades which are worth the difference in price.First and foremost, like the FlexCare line, it uses the ProResults head. This alone is worth the price difference. They snap in easily, they cost less, and the handle traps much less gunk than before. Sold. I&rsquo;m still waiting to see how long they last; my guess is about the same.In addition to the regular cleaning mode, the R710 has a second mode designed to scrub away stains. It&rsquo;s selected by pushing the power button twice. In this mode, the 5th (last) interval of the normal cycle is pulsed in a way that&rsquo;s supposed to break up stains on your visible teeth. Note that after this interval, the brush stops. If you still want to brush your tongue or concentrate on hard-to-reach areas, you&rsquo;ll have to push the power button again.The R710 now also comes with a Li-ion battery, which noticeably decreases the weight and increases the battery life. The charger is about half the size of the Elite&rsquo;s, but it doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere to wrap the cord like the deluxe charger on the Flexcare. It comes with an (optional) snap-on plate that holds two extra heads. The charge indicator is a simple LED. If it&rsquo;s blinking, it&rsquo;s below 50%; if it&rsquo;s solid, then it&rsquo;s above. Maybe not as informative or fun to watch as the Elite or FlexCare, but it does the job.In short, if you want a good basic Sonicare, this is the one to get. It has all the great redesigned features of the FlexCare but less of the (IMO gimmicky) extra routines and modes. If you have sensitive teeth, check out the R732. For an extra $20, it also comes with a few extra accessories like a case and deluxe charger.UPDATE (1/5/2011): My Sonicare failed a few days before the 2-year warranty expired. It powered on, but the action gradually weakened over a week, until the brush head no longer moved at all.Following a short call, Philips promptly sent out a new HX6730 handle along with a return mailer for the defective unit. Great support, as long as you&rsquo;re within the warranty period.</p>

<h5 id="motor-is-working-but-no-longer-vibrating">Motor is working but no longer vibrating</h5>

<p>After 5 yrs. finally gave up. Machine still works but sensitivity to pressure is increased, so the brush no longer vibrates when the smallest amount of pressure is detected.</p>
