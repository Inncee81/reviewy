<h5 id="total-control">Total control !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is perfect. I work away from home a lot, nd this camera gives me peace of mind to not only check on my home itself, but my dogs as well. The best feature is the sound. I can hear them, AND they can hear me ! So when they&rsquo;re being mischievous and jumping on the coffee table, I can tell them to get down&hellip; right from the comfort of my office. The picture quality is great, zoom is an excellent feature, and the camera rotates through my entire living space with the touch of a button. I have many cameras in my home and this one is my favorite. I want to add another one to my son&rsquo;s room.It&rsquo;s a huge relief to know exactly what&rsquo;s doing on in my home even when I can&rsquo;t be there.</p>

<h5 id="picture-perfect-ip-camera">Picture perfect IP Camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this camera so far, I live in Chicago, where crime tends to always be an issue, so I got this IP camera to be able record and watch the front of my house. This is very easy to set up, requires a Micro SD (Class 10) card to be able to record internally, but is very much worth it! The picture and audio quality is really good, however I only use it for video, and allows the camera to record when motion is detected. This is a great security camera and I highly recommend it to anyone that is in the need to an affordable security camera!</p>

<h5 id="great-cat-cam">Great Cat Cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to see that my cat did while I am gone. I had a doctor&rsquo;s appointment and while I was waiting to see the doctor I decided to see what my cat was up to. I pulled up the app on my phone to see. He was sitting in the window looking out and watching the birds fly by. So after my appointment I checked again he was sitting right in front of the camera staring at it. I waited a couple of minutes for him to get down and when he didn&rsquo;t I turned the mic on and told him to get down. He got down and started to look for me,lol</p>

<h5 id="works-well">Works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This security camera is great. It has the ability to soom in and out and rotate to where I need to see. I really like the ability to monitor the baby whenever I need to. This camera quickly and easily connected to my home wifi and I was able to set it up in a breeze. I really like this camera as it just looks very nice. In fact, it looks exactly as advertised. I&rsquo;m really glad that I got this to watch the children when need be. This is great for peace of mind.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera">Great Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Camera is amazingly compact and gets great picture at all light settings. I wanted a camera that would blend right in where ever I needed it. It does this very good and has very good picture quality so that is no issue when using. It does loop recording on your ad card so you do not have to worry about replacement and can keep it running <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. Overall the quality of this camera is phenomenal and is well worth the price.Thank you for your review.</p>

<p>This security camera is great, or doesn&rsquo;t hook up to wpa, you have to change the settings on your computer, you download an app, connect through that (it makes a very admitting screaming noise that apparently it had to hear top connect. ..) after figuring that out our wad pay simple, now i can catch the amazon amzl driver throwing my packages.
