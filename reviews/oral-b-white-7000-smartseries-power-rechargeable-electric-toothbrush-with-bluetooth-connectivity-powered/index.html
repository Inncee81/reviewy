<h5 id="8-reasons-why-this-brush-is-not-really-what-you-are-looking-for">8 reasons why this brush is not really what you are looking for&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a proud owner of the 5000 series for the last 6 years and wanted to refresh a little bit. Here is why I returned my 7000 series:1. Very annoying stops in the middle of my brushing. The 5000 series has it as well, but the 7000 makes a complete stop for 1-2 seconds and then continues. It messes my entire &ldquo;auto-mode&rdquo; in the mornings.2. This 7000 series has an inferior battery. NiMH batteries die much quicker than Li-ion batteries. This is one of the reasons why your cell phones have the latter. The 5000 series (my brush) used to have Li-ion battery, but it looks like Oral-B (P&amp;G) changed all their brushes to NiMH to save some $ and offer you a more expensive brush at the same time.3. Tongue mode is pretty useless. You will use it 1-2 times and then stop playing with the different brush modes and use only one.4. Travel case is nice, but how much do you really travel? You can also purchase a case separately for the 5000 series if that&rsquo;s important for you. Paying additional $60 for a travel case is pretty much absurd.5. The design is nice, but it&rsquo;s weird that the brush itself is white and the handle is black. Looks disconnected from each other - but who cares how your brush looks like?6. The charger doesn&rsquo;t support 240V. So if you travel outside the US - good luck with that. The old 5000 series supports both 110 and 240V. Current 5000 series doesn&rsquo;t support 240V anymore. Another way for Oral-B to increase their profit margin I guess.7. The battery last for approx. 10 days (with brushing twice a day for 2min). It takes about 20h to get a full charge.8. The blue light, while the brush is charging (flickering), can annoy some people. It&rsquo;s the most common complain online on this brush.Anyway, Amazon is lowering the price every couple of days now and playing between $160 and $130. There is a $30 coupon right now, so you can get it around $100 - don&rsquo;t pay more than that - it doesn&rsquo;t worth it.I will keep my 5000 series since it&rsquo;s still working and don&rsquo;t see currently any good alternatives on the market; Sonicare Diamond, for example, has only 31,000 strokes/minute while Oral-B has 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscilations (also known as 3D tooth by tooth cleaning).</p>

<h5 id="rechargeable-battery-wears-down-very-quickly">Rechargeable battery wears down very quickly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In less than two months a full battery charge lasts fewer than 4 uses. I&rsquo;m not sure if our battery was defective or if others have the same issue. Either way it is an issue since one can&rsquo;t return the toothbrush after 30 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This toothbrush is absolutely incredible. I&rsquo;ve been brushing twice a day since I was a little kid using the best manual brushes and toothpaste. I just switched to the Oral-B 7000 and I can&rsquo;t explain how different my teeth feel. The first time I used it my teeth felt much cleaner and polished like when you leave the dentist for your 6 month cleaning. I&rsquo;m so happy I finally switched to an electric brush. I&rsquo;d highly suggest people to make the switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny-how-do-you-put-a-price-on-good-oral-care-health">Worth every penny! How do you put a price on good oral care/health?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I need to weigh in on this product. This is the THIRD Oral-B that I have had; the second Triumph. I admit that this is a pricey &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; brush however over the last almost 19 yrs have used nothing but. (My brushes lasting from 5-7 yrs before that battery dies makes the math not too far off when buying new toothbrushes on a regular basis). To me, the benefits of this brush FAR outweigh the cost. If you have perfect teeth and no issues, maybe you can forgo. However for some in the population, this toothbrush alone is the reason for great check ups, virtually no plaque and cavities to say nothing of the whiter teeth and brighter smile. (Recommended by my dentist almost 20 yrs ago!).Some have complained about the length of time to charge the toothbrush. If you need to use it while it is taking 24hrs to charge, you can stop it, use the brush and put it back on the charger. Not a deal breaker.I&rsquo;ve read that people have mentioned the flashing blue light as it charges. It can be annoying I suppose, but the toothbrush is in the bathroom charging and, looking on the bright side, can be a beacon pointing you to the commode. Once the handle has the full charge the light goes off.Some have complained about the &ldquo;1-2 second delay&rdquo; after each 30 second period of brushing. It is nowhere near that. A second is &ldquo;one thousand one; one thousand two&rdquo;. It does hesitate (all of them did/do to indicate the time to switch quadrants of your mouth in brushing) but nothing even close to a full second rather than two. When it hesitates, switch quadrants and by the time you get there you are off and spinning again.Some complained about how the battery runs down quickly especially when traveling. I agree. It does. I travel extensively and I think it has to have something to do with the x-ray or the high altitude in flight. No kidding. When traveling by car, the charge seems to last longer. Not sure why that is. So, now I just throw my charger in my suitcase (since the toothbrush battery seems to eventually die, I have extra chargers). I just keep one charger in my bag that is always packed for those last minute trips or I am packing so quickly I fear I may forget something important.A couple of the reviews think the clock/brushing timer is a waste of money. Not me. I like that little guy smiling at me especially in the morning and many times at night. In my line of work (the medical field) I don&rsquo;t get a lot of smiles.Could they have chosen a better color than black? Yep. However, I&rsquo;ve had white ones for the last 19 yrs and it&rsquo;s a welcome change. And this case is definitely classy. I had cases for my last toothbrush but this one is VERY lovely.In summary, if you want excellent check ups, brighter whiter teeth without all of these expensive toothpastes, clean teeth ALL the time then it is worth the purchase. There is often a coupon available for these toothbrushes either on Oral-B website or your dentist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ya its a pretty bitchin brush, nothing to get all hot about though.. It motivates you to brush your teeth because you realize your 2am amazon purchase was a $120 toothbrush but ya, the app is cool.. My teeth do feel cleaner after i use it, it may all be placebo though who really knows, right..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-3-days-after-the-return-window-closed">Broke 3 days after the return window closed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this three days before a three week trip. Before leaving I kept it on the charger and then used it once a day while traveling. There was still one bar on the charge indicator but when I placed the unit on the charger it would not accept a charge. This is very disappointing as the return window closed on the 23rd of February 2017 (while I was still traveling) and now I will have to try to receive satisfaction from Oral-B, not something I look forward to.</p>
