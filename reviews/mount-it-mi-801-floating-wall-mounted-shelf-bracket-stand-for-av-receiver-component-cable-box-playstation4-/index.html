<h5 id="beware">Beware</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchase this exact unit back in 2012. Today while I was in another room I heard this loud bang and what sounded like a truck load of marbles hitting the floor! What the blank?? One of the shelf&rsquo;s gave out for no reason! What a mess, glass everywhere. I found glass 12 feet from where it happened. I am thankful no one was setting near or my grandson playing near these shelf&rsquo;s. True I purchased this 4 years ago and I was happy with the unit, but I cannot give this product a positive review knowing the possibility this could happen to someone else. These glass shelf&rsquo;s are only supported were they attach to the wall mount. Just beware.UpdateI wanted to add some pic’s to give you a better idea of what happened. The set-top box is an Xfinity RNG-150N which measures 8 x 10 and weighs 3 pounds. So weigh was not an issue. The picture doesn’t show the very fine sharp glass slivers which left scratches on both the DVD player and the wood floor. I can’t imagine what this would have done to a person.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-good-when-mounted-but-is-a-little-tricky">Looks good when mounted but is a little tricky</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This shelf works well once mounted but getting it mounted requires two people. I recommend assembling the shelving first so you can have a rough idea where the mounting plate should go. Another design improvement would be to make the hole in the top plate large enough to fit a plug for a power strip.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-mount-it-purchased-and-installed">Three Mount-It! Purchased and Installed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased three and used them on a 50&rdquo;, 47&rdquo; and 32&rdquo; size tv&rsquo;s. They are worth the time and effort needed to assemble and mount. I read through other reviews and the most helpful was to thread the wires prior to mounting. Map out your wire length and and wire placement before starting. It will help if you have three or more wires. We had all the required parts, had no faulty pieces and the no complaints with the setup. You will need another person to help hold the shelf for the last portion of the assembly. We did use a stud finder and drill to complete this project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-for-every-home">a must for every home</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Never knew media consoles can also be wall mounted until i saw it on amazon. These shelves make our place look more contemporary. Very well made. will definitely buy more for other rooms.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-looking-sturdy-shelf-good-for-entertainment-center">Nice looking, sturdy shelf. Good for entertainment center.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this shelf to mount my AV Receiver out of the reach of a toddler. For that it does its job well. I have it mounted above my TV, slightly offset so I could rotate the arm and have the receiver sitting closer to the wall (it sticks out a good way if pointed straight out from the wall). The shelf looks nice, is the perfect size for my receiver and is quite sturdy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-great-option-for-a-single-shelf-solution">What a great option for a single shelf solution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great option for a single shelf solution. You can mount this either right side up or you can invert the back plate if need be. I needed to simply because I was mounting this over a plasma T.V. I needed that hole you see in the photograph below not above the shelf. It takes a little getting used to the assembly but if you are mechanically inclined it will be no problem. If you suck at mechanical stuff, please don&rsquo;t give up. It will come to you, trust me. If you are looking for a small, modern looking shelf to hold a piece of equipment or two, this is it. It went up in under an hour from assembly to installation. Cheers,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-nice-but">looks nice&hellip; but</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mounts to wall with drywall anchors (or a stud if you are lucky) THEY ONLY GIVE YOU 4, and there are 6 mounting holes. You mount a small 5 inch square plate and then hang this whole unit on that bracket using small aluminum screws to secure it from the top. It works, but aluminum was an interesting choice for screws.RUN YOUR WIRES FIRST. Do not expect to be able to run the wires easily once this thing is up.<strong><em>THE TOP</em></strong> is limiting. There is a hole at the top to run all of your wires up to your TV, but there is limited space, so run your wires first and limit the amount of wires you run.I feel there may be better solutions, but this one works for what I need. I&rsquo;m just not super impressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="clean-shelf-without-arms-under-the-glass">Clean shelf without arms under the glass!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m using this to hold a center channel speaker that weighs about 15 pounds. One nice feature of this shelf compared to multiple others on Amazon is the fact that there is no support under the glass. There is a small piece that is under the glass that mounts against the wall but no arms extended out to support the glass. This gives a clean look. The whole shelf is mounted directly below my TV and the height of my speaker blocks the view of the shelf wall bracket. The speaker appears to just float there. The plastic of the shelf that is against the wall is a gloss black which matches the gloss black of the plastic around my TV.At first the shelf did sag a little in the front, but adding two small stick on bumper pads between the lower bracket under the glass and the wall fixed that. Highly recommend. Gets compliments from everyone who sees it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-sexy">So sexy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had to assemble disassemble a few times till I got the stack right. It matches the other electronics in our home and looks really good wall mounted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-only-if-you-like-cleaning-up-glass">Buy only if you like cleaning up glass!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this shelf in 2015, and put it up about a year ago. It is a very bad design, absolutely no support for the shelf, the glass is not tempered glass it is cheap clear glass&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-easy-to-mount-and-constructed-well">Love it, easy to mount and constructed well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it, easy to mount and constructed well. Only caveat is the cable conduit could have a little more room</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poorly-designed-for-modern-high-end-components">Poorly designed for modern high end components.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time if you have even average size components that you plan to place on these shelves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the shelf but after mounting noticed the shelf is not square with mount. Just disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works out great for TV and DVD player with accessories.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I wanted. Used it to set a epson 1450 projector on. Works great and looks good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-know-what-was-the-reason-but-i-am-happy-no-one-was-at-home-and-around-to-get">I don&rsquo;t know what was the reason but I am happy no one was at home and around to get &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this shelf a week ago and installed as instruction says. Two days ago the top shelf shuddered and left my apple tv and cable box to the bottom shelf.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-need-a-shelf-for-your-home-theater-receiver-this-is-it">If you need a shelf for your home theater receiver, this is it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a spectacular option for a receiver. It&rsquo;s the only thing sturdy enough and large enough to handle it. I bought another set of shelves from these guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-even-in-extreme-conditions">Works even in extreme conditions.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wall mounting was not typical. It was on exposed brick and 100+ years old beams layered into the brick. All worked out fine just not quickly.</p>
