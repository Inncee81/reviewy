<h5 id="this-is-a-great-quadcopter-but-it-does-take-some-knowledge-and">This is a great quadcopter. But it does take some knowledge and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great quadcopter. But it does take some knowledge and preparation. It needs to have the compass calibrated before flight. Just takes a few minutes.. You must allow time for it to get a GPS lock. Check the return home to see that both the Bebop and the Flight Controller have GPS, and good GPS. Don&rsquo;t fly with only 2 bars. TURN OFF SMART DEVICE (PHONE) WIFI when using the Flight Controller. Read everything you can about flying the Bebop. Study the tutorials before flying (Parrot has some very good ones). Research YouTube.Camera has pros and cons. Center line camera with stabilization is great, but number of pixels are limited so it does not have great low light resolution. Stabilization is faster than gimbal. The gimbal adds weight and is highly susceptible to damage in even a minor crash. This is a hobby grade drone, it is not a toy or and entry level drone. It takes a little experience to get the most out of it. It is not an out of the box flyer. This is a flying camera. And with a little prep it will make great aerial videos and photos.Other quadcopter experience: Blade 350, Chroma, Bebop 1.</p>

<h5 id="great-quad">Great quad,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great. Great video and long range using the skycontroller 2. Only problem was the charger did not charge the battery, so they went dead. But parrot replaced it and all is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-ll-want-a-second-battery-and-some-spare-blades">You&rsquo;ll want a second battery and some spare blades</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone else has reviewed this drone so I won&rsquo;t. I will say that you&rsquo;ll want a second battery and some spare blades. You&rsquo;ll also want to make sure you&rsquo;ve got a big stick or a bunch of PVC pipes to get your drone out of a tree. Because you will get it stuck in a tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price-on-discount">Great for the price (on discount)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had two flight sessions with the drone so far and am enjoying the experience. The camera quality is good but definitely not as good as hardware stabilization.The Good: The drone is well build for the price and comes with some nice accessories. I like that the design separates the motors from most of the other components with elastomers rather than just isolating the camera. There are a lot of settings that can be confusing at first but will be appreciated once you get the hang of what everything does. The FPV goggles (phone holder) worked well and FPV mode has a nice interface to help keep track of where the drone is compared to where you are.The Bad: The nose cone on the drone is made out of a material that looks similar to what is used on cycling helmets. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with using this material, but but would be nice if they had covered all of it up with the thin layer of plastic that covers the top.My phone does seem to get a little warm when using the FPV goggles. I don&rsquo;t think this will be a problem if the goggles aren&rsquo;t used flight after flight or on warmer days. It&rsquo;s unfortunate though that the goggles replace the option that the old remote had of connecting a set of more expensive FPV glasses. I would have preferred that both options be possible. If you decided you really liked FVP mode you&rsquo;d have an upgrade path to get dedicated FPV glasses.The new remote does have any way to attach a neck harness. It looks like you might be able to find an eyelet that could screw into the phone mount, but then you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use the phone mount while using a harness.The Bebop 2 no longer comes with prop guards and the ones that are available (not made by Parrot) look a bit flimsy.Most of the things that I don&rsquo;t like about the drone are vey minor issues and none of them alone would add up to a lower than perfect rating, but together they add up to one less star.When I purchased this, it was offered at a significant discount. I am very happy with it for the money that I paid, but at the normal price, I probably would have looked closer at some of the other available drones.</p>

<h5 id="the-fpv-is-very-cool-with-either-my-iphone-6s-or-my-6s-plus">the FPV is very cool with either my iphone 6S or my 6S plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a drone that would fly itself until I knew how to fly it. This is that DRONE!the FPV is very cool with either my iphone 6S or my 6S plus, both work great. The controller is easy to use and I prefer it to using the iphone for controlling the drone. The holder works with my phones and my iPad air 2 which is great. I also purchased the backpack to keep it safe and bought a couple of extra batteries. This exceeded my expectations and I would have to make an effort to crash it. My 8 year old nephew was flying it like a pro first time he tried. I will be buying more Parrot products Great Quality and Design.</p>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Go ahead and buy one. It flies by itself&hellip; A six yr old can fly it. Very easy to operate. Video quailty at 1080 and stabilization system is amazing. Quality parts. Just a great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-great-little-drone">What a great little drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great little drone. Parrot has done superior engineering and the app and drone perform flawlessly out of the box.Just follow instructions and ample videos in set up and preparations and away you go.The app can be set to restrict how high or far the BeeBop can travel which is a great safety feature as you learn.Full capabilities, home, etc and comes with controller, uses you phone or, can use FPV. FPV is not virtual reality as you use your phone as the viewer inside the goggles but, the app sets up dual screen view that results is almost 3D view.Camera is great and fully controllable and HD.I highly recommend this as a fun and durable drone. It can do anything the big mor expensive biys can do.</p>
