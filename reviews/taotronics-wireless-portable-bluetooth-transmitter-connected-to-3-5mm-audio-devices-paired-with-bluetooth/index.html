<h5 id="love-this-thing">Love this thing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This transmitter is was a godsend. It works beautifully and was very easy to setup. I&rsquo;ve personally got mine running through the output from my TV and the internal battery ensures it will always be ready to go. TV charges it when its on and the battery will keep it up and running until the set is powered on once more.The device without fail remembers and automatically connects to either of my stereo headsets upon powering them on so I don&rsquo;t need to worry about getting up to pair anything. its all one and done. I&rsquo;m now able to hear my PlayStation at night when the rest of the house is sleeping or the girlfriend and I can both sync up to it to watch movies while the baby sleeps. Whatever is output through my TV is now simultaneously output through the transmitter. I love that it accepts multiple headsets at once though I haven&rsquo;t tested exactly how many so far, just the two I own currently.I retract one star due to the short audio cable and for most that won&rsquo;t be an issue, but when its run like I have it setup the television cuts down the range somewhat and that&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer. also there is a slight lag in the audio but personally its nothing that bothers me much and in fact I&rsquo;ve noticed that as long as the televisions audio is off my brain makes up for the difference pretty well.</p>

<h5 id="very-useful-and-easy-to-install-operate-device">Very Useful and easy to install/operate Device!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have a Blue Toothed receiver out by the pool and have used our phones to connect to it. That worked fine, but limits were the music from my phone can be played (inside the house or outside by the pool). Having a Smart TV we connect to the music stations when not actually watching TV. The TaoTronics Wireless Transmitter did the trick. Connecting this device to the audio output of the Smart TV always music to still be played on the TV (or with the TV muted if you wanted) AND broadcast to the outside Blue Tooth speaker on the pool patio.The TaoTronic unit is charged from the USB on the TVThe only problem experienced was during the my install, but READING ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS solved that problem, which was to delete a old blue tooth receiver that was already stored on the TaoTraonic Transmitter. The transmitter will only store and connect to one target receiver at a time. Figured the old stored blue tooth location was from the factory QA Testing of my device.</p>

<h5 id="please-read-this-review-it-s-important">Please Read This Review - It&rsquo;s Important!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I originally wrote a review of this product that was one star for the product and 5 stars forthe company and the way they handled my issue.Basically the problem was that the original transmitter would not hold a charge and wouldnot pair with my headset. I contacted the company and they sent me (in two days) a replacementtransmitter, no questions asked! I thought that this was very kind of them, but the second onewouldn&rsquo;t pair either. After some back and forth they determined that the problem was with my headset and so they sent me a different type transmitter that did pair with my device.This transmitter works flawlessly and I am very happy with it and the ease with which it pairs each andevery time I turn on the TV.I want every one out there to know that I have no connection with the company, I&rsquo;m not paid to say orwrite this, but I must tell you that Tao Tronics is a first class outfit. They went out of their way to makethis right as expediently as is possible. It seemed to me that their only concern was my satisfaction andfor that I am grateful.Thank you so much Rosie and Efrain for your help and support throughout this issue. I will always recommendyour company to anyone who asks. It&rsquo;s rare to find a company these days with service like yours.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-bluetooth-transmitter-for-headphones-for-the-tv-peace-quiet-in-the-tv-room">Excellent Bluetooth Transmitter for Headphones for the TV! Peace &amp; Quiet in the TV Room!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Gosh darn, when I set out to buy my husband a bluetooth headphone I discovered our TV wasn&rsquo;t set up for bluetooth reception! So, I shopped around and found this nifty gadget which was charged up in a TV USB port and plugged into the &ldquo;Audio Out&rdquo; port. It transmits the sound from the TV beautifully to his wireless headphones, and I&rsquo;m ecstatic since I can play or read on my computer in perfect peace while he has the volume set up high. Sweet!God bless &lsquo;em for making this gadget!</p>

<h5 id="peace-of-mind-and-ears">Peace of mind and ears</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this unit for my 93 year old mother who can&rsquo;t hear worth a darn. We tried 3 other products that were RF controlled devises and required large headsets which she did not like because they were too bulky. Then tried another brand of blue tooth technology where she could wear ear buds. The transmitter lasted 4 days, replaced them with another set and those lasted 7 days before the transmitter burned out. So, got on Amazon and saw that the TaoTonics devise had a huge number of satisfied reviews with over 80% of those reviews 4 stars or higher. The transmitter is working terrific. Mom has been using them 10 hours a day, and loves the ability to walk around the home without wires. The transmitter works flawlessly and if a 93 year old that is afraid of electronic technology is able to make these work, anyone can do it. Mom is very happy with the sound. And I am happy that they are reliable so I don&rsquo;t have to drive 20 miles every time she has an issue. I both a second set as back up for her and to allow her to come to my house and watch TV where we can listen at our level, and Mom can have her volume at the level she needs (which nearly full blast!).</p>

<h5 id="does-exactly-what-it-says">Does exactly what it says.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A Bluetooth transmitter that does exactly what it says.It works very well with my FiiO X1 high def player with no apparent sound degradation.I&rsquo;m not quite sure of it&rsquo;s maximum usable distance but works well with what I consider a reasonable separation distance (8-12Ft)The manufacturers specs claim a distance of 33Ft. however I was unable to substantiate this.It operates on Bluetooth V2.1 with a profile of A2DP,AVRCPIt has 6-7 hour operating time frame and 140 hours in standby mode.Recharge time is approximately 2.5 hours via the micro USB port.There is also a small LED to indicate power on, pairing and charging.</p>
