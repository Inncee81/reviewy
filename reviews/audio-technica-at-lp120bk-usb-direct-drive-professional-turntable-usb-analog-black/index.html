<blockquote>
<p>OK&hellip;I don&rsquo;t normally write many reviews. But I felt compelled to write about this turntable. First of all, I will start out by saying I grew up with TT&rsquo;s most of my life. I did have a pair of Technics 1200s way back in the day and worked in every Dance club within a 50 mile radius at one time as well. Then as I got older and the digital world caught on&hellip;I won&rsquo;t say I lost my passion for vinyl&hellip;but did find myself amused by CD technology and was hooked. And like many other people my age, the crates of vinyl got stored and rarely played. I had also gotten married and no longer worked in the club scene, so I sold the 1200&rsquo;s. And opted for a single Direct drive Auto Technics Turntable just to always have one available. But it only got turned on a few times in many years. Well, recently while going through some old keepsake items, I kept looking at those old crates of records and caught a new vinyl bug. Little did I know&hellip;I was already behind the 8 ball and Vinyl has been all the rage. So I began playing the records again. But that old Technics unit had sit so long&hellip;it just wasn&rsquo;t working right. So the search was on and I ran into this one. Read all the rave reviews about it and for the money, felt it was a good deal. Besides the fact that it looks almost identical to my old 1200&rsquo;s&hellip;so it was a no brainer. I&rsquo;m not going to be Djing with it but I already knew my way around it. It came delivered in perfect shape. I did an extensive set up on it. Plugged it in and gave it a whirl.Well&hellip;It tracks great and is a very heavy duty build quality. I did pick up an extra stylus head and opted for an Audio Technica AT440MLB cart and now this thing really sounds good. The AT95E that now comes stock is pretty good as well but it has it&rsquo;s drawbacks. First off, this TT has a built in Pre amp and usb port. It comes with Audacity software to load onto your computer so you can just plug the unit into your computer and archive all your vinyl to MP3, etc. But it is a known fact on these Turntables, this built in Pre amp, even when not in use tends to darken or muddy up the overall sound or your records. Many people have pulled the pre amp out and experienced a much brighter sound. Many youtube vids showing this done. I plan on keeping mine stock just in case I ever want to archive all my vinyl one day..and have worked around the whole &ldquo;Muddy, Dark&rdquo; sound issue with the use of the AT440MLB cart and a little ol thing called an EQ. Yes&hellip;an EQ does wonders on any analog type equipment. A little EQ adjustment for Vinyl&hellip;store the setting in one of the six pre sets on the Technics EQ and all done.All in all&hellip;if your looking for an audiophile turntable&hellip;keep looking. There are great ones out there. But your going to spend double the price just to get in the ballpark. Not including the cart. But if you just want to play your records with a quality unit that will sound great, not tear up your records and looks fantastic I highly recommend this unit. Of course though&hellip;the set up is crucial and very important. They make this unit in Silver and Black and I wore myself out trying to decide which one to get. But I finally opted for the Black one and so glad I did. It is a High Gloss Black and looks fantastic. Very classy looking.I gave it four stars because I did have to make a cart change to get the audio quality I was looking for. But in all fairness, that is a personal thing and you may find the one that comes with it is perfect for you. Pick one up and try it out, everyone should have at least one Turntable !</p>

<p>This turntable was an upgrade from an Audio-Technica AT-LP 60. I have been listening to my vinyl more and more lately and, while there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with my old turntable, I just kept thinking/feeling that I wasn&rsquo;t getting the best sound from it so I started looking around for an upgrade. I looked at offerings from Pro-Ject, U Turn and others&hellip; with most of those I would have ended up spending more for the turntable and then also have to purchase an amp to place between my turntable and my receiver (which doesn&rsquo;t have a Phono input).I realize that many &ldquo;audiophiles&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t crazy about this turntable because of the built-in phono amp. I&rsquo;m not one of those guys who sits around in a smoking jacket sipping brandy&hellip; analyzing the sound quality of my music. I am a guy who&rsquo;s listened to music all his life, loves great music and a great, big sound coming out of his speakers. This turntable delivers like Domino&rsquo;s for me and my needs. From a build-quality perspective it&rsquo;s definitely a step up from my old turntable. It is heavy (there is a large metal weight bolted inside the bottom of the chassis (I found this out by watching a couple youtube videos). Even though the chassis is plastic on the outside, the weight and feel of the switches/controls feels really good. Everything from the power switch to the start/stop button to the cueing lever feels like good quality to me. The hinged cover opens with a good, solid feel and stays put in the open position. There are a lot of features here that I&rsquo;ll probably never use&hellip; not a DJ so I don&rsquo;t know that I really need to change the pitch of my music or play a record backwards. If you&rsquo;re interested in doing any of these things they&rsquo;re here for you. I do really like the pop-up light tho. It keeps me from having to turn on brighter lights to line the stylus up with the beginning of the record.I did spend a bit more to get the black version, but I&rsquo;m happy with the way it looks with all the rest of my other components which happen to be black. If you are interested in upgrading components you can always get a higher-quality cartridge/stylus. I don&rsquo;t hate the one it came with which is the Audio-Technica AT95E (the green one). Apparently this turntable used to come with a lesser-quality cart that was white.One last thing, and it&rsquo;s a very important note. My old Audio-Technica turntable&rsquo;s cover got scratched up really bad during a move. I contacted Audio-Technica support to ask about ordering a new cover. I fully expected the cover to cost a crazy amount of money and for it to be such a huge pain in the ass that I&rsquo;d just say the heck with it. I contacted their tech support and got a reply from someone within 24 hours. He was incredibly helpful and told me the part number I needed and the price. I was impressed with how nice and helpful he was as well as the fact that they weren&rsquo;t gouging me for the replacement cover (I think it was around $20). I called him back and ordered the replacement, shipping was a very reasonable $4 and it was on my doorstep within 3 days. I was surprised and impressed with the service I got&hellip; something I don&rsquo;t think most people can say very often.</p>
