<p>Color:Blackout
Go all out with the Jaybird X3 Wireless Headphones! These earbuds are designed to be tiny, but packed to the brim with functionality, unbeatable comfort, and incredible sound quality.</p>

<p>The 3rd incarnation in Jaybird’s X series, these are the culmination of the company’s sports earbud innovations. Smaller than ever, the X3 has a longer battery life, better sound, and a more secure fit. The in-ear speaker design has been significantly reduced by 20% and houses an enhanced 6mm driver for subtle lows and a booming bass. The smaller frame is more convenient to handle and offers a comfortable fit for different ear sizes. The earbuds can even be worn underneath a helmet. The frame is made from sandblasted, injection-molded metal for heavy-duty durability and a sleek style that does not affect Bluetooth signal strength. Additionally, the hydrophobic nano-coating makes the whole earbud waterproof, preventing sweat, snow, and rain from affecting your soundtrip! The X3 serves as a reliable partner for athletes and savvy business travelers who are always on the go. Be ready to answer an important call anywhere with confidence!</p>

<p>A wide variety of customized fit options are already included inside the box. The patented silicone ear fins (S, M, L) keep the buds securely inside your ear or can be used to hang them over the top. Lift the cord off your neck for a comfortable workout experience! Additionally, the Comply memory foam ear tips are designed to provide maximum noise isolation and comfort. They lock in the headphone for a super secure fit, whether you’re on a calm jog or riding an MTB trail.</p>

<p>Also, the MySound app allows you to customize every aspect of your sound: from the rumbling lows to the sweetest highs! Customize every detail with the easy-to-understand interface. Compatible with iOS 9+ and Android 4.4+, your customized presets save directly onto the X3 buds, carrying them over to any music device or streaming service/app you use. Listen the way you want to or discover how your favorite athletes and artists enjoy their music through their custom sound profiles. Also, the Multipoint function allows you to simultaneously pair and connect the X3 buds to two different Bluetooth devices. Listen to your music through your laptop while still answering calls on your phone with the bud controller. You can also share your music with ease, as two separate buds can connect to the same Bluetooth device, eliminating the need to share earphones. You can even connect to your smartwatch and leave your smartphone at home!</p>

<p>With 8 hours of battery life, the Jaybird X3 is just as ready as you are for any exciting adventure! Run wild and stop worrying about your sound quality. The X3 has got you covered.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-freedoms-on-par-with-the-jlab-epic-2s">Better than the freedoms, on par with the JLab Epic 2s!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I lost my JLab Epic 2s, and though I would move up the Jaybirds. However, as many of you reading this review might also be wondering, I questioned if it was worth the extra $20 to get the freedoms instead of the X3s. So I bought both. In short, the X3s are the way to go!Sound is better on the X3s! This is (in my own theory anyway) primarily due to the larger driver that can place in the housing so you can get better bass response. However, this is indeed larger, so it will stick out of your ears a lot more than the tiny Freedoms.Fit: X3s easily, hands down. In fact, i could not get the freedoms to stay comfortably in my ears, whereas the x3s can fit them and don&rsquo;t fall out even without the fins and using the same exact size earpiece. I would have returned the freedoms regardless.The extra charger &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; with the freedoms is pointless to me really, as it makes them heavier on one side and I would rather have a longer charge time right up front, as I supposedly do with the X3s. Plus this charge box is 1 extra part to keep track of, whearas the X3s have the charge base strapped to the USB charge cord.The cord on the X3s is flat, versus a round one on the freedoms. Not really a big deal on either, but I noted that.Both: Connecting them both to my phone was seamless and the App is actually pretty cool and well designed. Not as hokey as I thought it would be.Phone calls: Meh for both. They pick up to much traffic noise ambient sound etc, for your listener. If you want something for phone calls, get the LG HBS series headsets. These are for working out, but you can make a call in a pinch.Anyway, the X3s are better in fit (easily), better in sound (easily), and are cheaper. The only downside is they stick out a little more, but at the gym who cares. I hope this helps.NOW: As a previous owner of the JB Epic 2s, I can give you that run down as well: Epics are ALSO way better than the freedoms. So what to buy? That is a tough choice: I was not able to compare the sound side by side as i lost my Epics, but they sounded great, and so do the X3s. The Epics also fit excellent, although they are only a wrap over the ear style, whereas the X3s allow you to do both styles as you wish. The Epics also have a charge port on them any micro USB would work on, versus a required device the X3s need. They both stick out of your head just as far (maybe a slightly less for the Epics).I would say that you cant go wrong with either of these (X3s or the Epic2s), but if I were to buy again, I&rsquo;d give a slight edge to the epics due to price alone and the longer battery life.</p>

<h5 id="jaybird-s-still-got-it">Jaybird&rsquo;s still got it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much improved since the original Bluebuds X. They are much lighter and the earbuds themselves are less bulky and stick out less, which makes them more aesthetically appealing and more comfortable to use during workout or casual listening. Battery life is great as in previous iterations. I love the new audio prompts, super cheerful sexy voice; it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m in a Zumba class with a super sexy instructor hehe ;)My only issue is that for me the earbuds nozzle is still a bit too big for my ear canals and that makes the Comply foam tips wear out quickly and don&rsquo;t provide as much of a cushioned seal as other Comply foam tips for other headphones (i.e. the Sennheiser in-ear momentum). The silicon tips are okay but I prefer Comply, which is what I use in all my other earphones. Although, to be fair, it doesn&rsquo;t bother my ears as much as the older Bluebuds X did, which I had to remove after ~4-5 hours of studying and listening (didn&rsquo;t notice it much during 2-3 hours workouts though).I also expected a bit more of an audio upgrade. Yes, the audio stage feels a bit more expansive and the in-app EQ capabilities are super cool features but I wish they would&rsquo;ve added upgraded microdrivers to make the upgrade more worthwhile. Although, for the price point, these remain uncontested and they are definitely replacing my old Bluebuds X!</p>

<h5 id="awful-customer-service">Awful customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>after about one month the left ear bud had noise distortion (static) then completely stopped functioning. When I contacted customer service and explained the issue they suggested I reset the device 3x which I did but it didn&rsquo;t fix the problem. I requested a new set under the warranty claim. After about 6 weeks Jaybird still has not resolved the issue and has not honored their warranty. My experience with the customer service rep was poor and his supervisor did nothing to help either. They delay and create barriers to honoring their warranty. I do not recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="definately-worth-it">Definately worth it!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>100% satisfied with these earbuds. Fit is awesome, once I found the right combo of wings and buds. Sound quality is great, and even better once I found the right EQ setting on the app. I tried iFrogz, Phaiser, PowerBeats2&hellip; these ear buds BLOW THE REST AWAY. Definately worth the purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-runners">Perfect for runners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect. The over the ear set-up without the fins is easy to throw in and stays in place during long runs. Their light and the wireless works great even at distances up to 30ft. The sounds profile can be tuned with the free Jaybird app to suite your music preference. I struggle to think of a way they could make them better.</p>

<h5 id="broke-after-very-little-use">Broke after very little use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this on 3-27-2017 and yesterday 4-8-2017 while riding on my bike the stopped working. Tried to reboot but they would not come back on. Once I arrived home thinking that maybe somehow the battery went dead I tried to charge them but the charing light will not even come on. Very disappointed in this product. I have used these probably 10-12 times. Guess its back to the wired earbuds.</p>

<h5 id="they-also-have-great-battery-life">They also have great battery life</h5>
