<p>Size:1 Pack
A New Level of Hygiene
The luxury AquaBliss SF220 Inline Shower Filter features a Multi-Stage Filtration System guaranteed to
purify your shower water at any temperature. It removes chlorine and other harmful impurities, traps heavy
metals, such as lead, mercury, nickel, chromium, and inhibits the growth of organic substances such as
bacteria and fungi. You will immediately notice that the water feels softer, soap and shampoo lather up
better, your skin and hair feel rejuvenated and tangle free, and the chlorine odor is gone!</p>

<p>Greatly Reduces Chlorine Levels
Utility companies add chlorine to your water supply to kill bacteria. But this chlorine-treated water is bad
news-it causes dryness and flaky skin, brittle, damaged hair, and inexplicable fatigue. Especially when
unfiltered hot water turns to steam, and vast amounts of chlorine enter the body via skin pores and
inhalation. Prolonged exposure to chlorinated water could then lead to respiratory illness, skin disorders,
such as acne, and other serious health risks.</p>

<p>Multi-Stage Combination Filter System for both Hot and Cold Showers
The SF220 uses a proprietary mix of KDF-55, Active Carbon and Calcium Sulfite to filter the water.
KDF-55 works particularly well in purifying the water at higher temperatures. Activated Carbon charcoal
removes chlorine and other impurities in lower water temperatures. Calcium Sulfite is extremely effective at
removing chlorine in both hot and cold temperatures.</p>

<p>Easy DIY No-Tools Installation and Replaceable Cartridge Filter
The SF220 has universal <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; connections that easily and securely connects to your standard fixed,
overhead rainfall, hand-held or combo showerhead. The shower filter cartridge lasts six to eight months
(or after 10,000 - 12,000 gallons of water use) before it needs changing, to ensure optimal performance.

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="water-same-before-and-after">Water same before and after</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tested and compared the water from my shower faucet and the water from my Aquabliss filtered shower head with Hach Pool &amp; Spa Test Strips. The results are exactly the Same. The strip on the left is water from my showerhead, in the middle is from bathtub faucet, on the right is from faucet passed through a regular Brita filter as a control. You Can see that the colors are lighter with the Brita filter, so at-least I know it is working. I know strips are not the most accurate but I was expecting to see at least some differences. From top down, this is what these strips are testing for:Total hardnessTotal chlorineFree chlorinePHTotal alkalinityCyanuric acid</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-remove-chlorine">Does NOT remove Chlorine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BE WARNED - This product does NOT remove Chlorine. I tested using a pool test kit, and there was no visible difference between the shower using this filter and a shower using no filter. To make sure the test strips worked I also tested against our three-stage drinking water filtration system (which produces Chlorine-free water). I have requested a refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this installed for close to a week now and I&rsquo;m loving the results. I didn&rsquo;t really notice the chlorine smell all that much but now with it missing I can&rsquo;t hardly stand the smell of our sink water. Shampoo seems to lather better and soap rinses off better. It was super easy to install, they even included the plumbers tape. It was a little larger than I was expecting, probably 5-6 inches long, which will significantly lower your shower head if you are a tall person. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;7 and it&rsquo;s completely fine, but my husband is 5&rsquo;10 and can still get under it but doesn&rsquo;t care for the lower height. All in all I&rsquo;m very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="life-changer">Life changer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never left a product review for anything I&rsquo;ve purchased off amazon before, but with the results I&rsquo;ve received from this shower filter I absolutely had to. I&rsquo;m a 21 year old college kid. Over the past 5 months I moved into this new apartment complex near my school. When I was younger I had eczema, and acne but around 18 I outgrew all that. When I moved into this apt complex I began breaking out with some of the worst acne I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life. My skin began to get so flaky and the eczema returned; my hair was terribly greasy at the roots, but brittle and dry throughout the ends, and I felt consistently weak and low energy. After multiple trips to the dermatologist, new shampoo and conditioner, and lots of expensive acne and dry skin products it struck me that the water had to have been the culprit. After all I couldn&rsquo;t even bring myself to drink it due to how highly chlorinated and hard the water tasted. I bought and instulled this product and within a week my hair became thicker again and healthy root to tip. Within two weeks my acne had completely cleared and my dry skin had subsided. This product changed my life, I was so overwhelmed by how much my physical appearance had gone down the drain and to think.. the solution was as simple as a shower filter! (Easy to install, you&rsquo;re gonna need a wrench and definitely use the tape provided for you with the product, really helps with leaking!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-product">Fantastic product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the product itself, wow. In the beginning, I thought a product like this one was a bit silly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not drinking the water, who cares if it&rsquo;s &lsquo;pure&rsquo;?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one that thought that. After two days of using the product, I already noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin hydration, soap clearing, and water quality. I have since bought other filters for my other bathrooms, and I will always keep the filters up-to-date.Though the quality of this product is nothing short of stellar, it&rsquo;s the customer service that really won me over. To date, I have received four different emails from the AquaBliss customer service group, all personalized to my product, assuring me that I am not alone, should I ever need help. I don&rsquo;t anticipate having any issues with the device, as everything has been great so far, but I know I have reliable support if I need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="grateful">Grateful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great. I got this for my dorm and was a bit worried they wouldn&rsquo;t let me unscrew the shower head, but they said it was fine. My management put it on without telling me so I didn&rsquo;t end up using the little rubber rings or the tape that&rsquo;s provided with it, but there are no leaks whatsoever, so I hope it isn&rsquo;t too big of a deal. The hard water ended up making my pores huge and I lost a lot of hair, since I got this, my skin doesn&rsquo;t feel bone dry after a shower and my hair is back to feeling soft and more compliant with twist outs and such. The only thing is that when I first turn on the shower, the water kind of dribbles and looks kind of foamy I guess, but it only lasts for about 5 seconds, then it clears and gets a strong stream. But that doesn&rsquo;t really matter since I am waiting for the shower to get hot at that point anyway and it&rsquo;s only a few seconds,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="effective-for-chlorine-reduction">Effective for chlorine reduction</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to rate a shower filter without having tested the chemical composition of the water it puts out.All I can say is: so far so good.I do not believe this filter is effective in removing chloramines because it is neither a vitamin C filter nor does it have a great deal of contact with the water before output.However, for a basic chlorine filter, AquaBliss does the job and it&rsquo;s relatively easy to maintain. I&rsquo;ll keep it for a while.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, we have hard water that has traces of radon. The chlorination of the local water does not help. This has led to very dry skin, flaking, and itching. It was not noticeable perhaps for the first couple of weeks, but after three months the shower filter has definitely reduced these symptoms. It&rsquo;s not a miracle though, and the worse the water is the harder the filter works. I was hoping for the complete end to dandruff, but we all still have varying levels of it. The water pressure is not the best in our location, but the filter didn&rsquo;t seem to make it worse. ~Jacquline Ard</p>
