<p>Small size, big versatility
Super telephoto zoom and brilliant image quality
Pull the COOLPIX A900 out of a pocket or purse and capture distant subjects in staggering detail. Its super telephoto NIKKOR glass lens has the most zoom power of any COOLPIX Slim Zoom camera 35x optical zoom and a whopping 70x Dynamic Fine Zoom (an enhanced digital zoom that effectively doubles the reach)and its 20 MP backside illuminated image sensor produces brilliant image quality in nearly any light.</p>

<p>Always connected
Unleash new possibilities with a compatible smartphone
Install Nikon&rsquo;s new Snapbridge app on a compatible smartphone or tablet* and unlock exciting new capabilities with the COOLPIX A900. Built-in Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) maintain a constant connection between the app and your camera, so each shot you take automatically transfers to your smartphone or tablet for sharing, editing with photo apps or uploading to your favorite sites. You can even use the Snapbridge app to control your camera remotely!</p>

<p>Enjoy the view
Tilting 3.0-inch 921,000-dot LCD
The COOLPIX A900&rsquo;s large, tilting LCD makes it easy to compose your shots and monitor your video recording. You can also use it to find exciting new shooting angles. Reviewing and sharing your creations is a pleasure, too-every shot looks fantastic on the display.</p>

<p>Take control of your shots
Full manual exposure control
The COOLPIX A900 can go as far as you want to go. For advanced shooters, a PSAM mode dial is available right on top of the camera, much like a DSLR. Control the COOLPIX A900&rsquo;s aperture and shutter speed to shape your shots exactly as you want them or overcome difficult shooting situations. But you don&rsquo;t have to understand exposure controls to get great results-the COOLPIX A900 can do all that work for you.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-camera">I love this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is very good for the price. It takes clear pictures and good in low light. With any digital camera the further out you zoom the less clear the picture becomes. If you want super duper crystal clear pictures then spend the money and buy a better (more expensive) camera or get a tripod. Also if you plan on taking low light pictures without a flash then you should also be using a tripod. I keep a mini poseable tripod with me at all times. I&rsquo;ve used this camera in all light settings and haven&rsquo;t been disappointed. I had the s7000 for 2 days before I returned it and got this one. As for SnapBridge, I too was having connection problems. I think I figured it out. Once you&rsquo;re done with transferring your pictures unpair the camera from the SnapBridge app. You&rsquo;ll have to pair every time but it seems to work every time.</p>

<h5 id="works-very-well-would-recommend">Works very well - Would recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using it for a few weeks now; took it on a few expeditions with exemplary results. The different settings work well; programmable options work as promised, and the scene settings have been very useful. Photos average about 8.7 MB each so be prepared to have an extra memory card if shooting for extended periods of time. 4K video fills up the memory very quickly as well. Positioning the screen has a smooth but sturdy feel to it. Notches on either of the top corners are available for wrist straps or a neck strap.Only real caution is the flash feels a little flimsy; take care while it is extended. Despite that, would definitely recommend.Posted are a few of the photos I have taken so far.</p>

<h5 id="rushed-to-market">Rushed to Market!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was execited to get this camera as an upgrade from the Panasonic ZS50 and after a week of using I must say I am really disappointed. First off the low light pictures are horrible with all the various settings tried. I just could not locate a sweet spot despite shooting the same test subject over and over for trial and error. Also anything zoomed optically at 20x or more looses focuses extremely easy causing poor quality photos. Seems to me the only way to use zoom at this level is to use a tripod and not have a moving subject or background. I also noticed many functions are delayed or flat out faulty. For instance, the flash on, or change from auto photo mode to a creative mode becomes unresponsive from anywhere from a couple seconds or to many more. Additionally the pairing mode over Bluetooth and wifi to an IOS device does not completely work, and you need The SnapBridge app to do this. Once downloaded the Bluetooth pairing is straightforward and very simple. However, if you plan to use the app to control the camera, it wants to establish a wifi connection. After doing so, it repeatedly disconnects. I tried troubleshooting this issue for a solid 3 hours to no avail. It also does the exact samething if you try to download pics from the camera to an iOS device. Last I did not care for the feel of the camera. It felt overly delicate especially with the tilting LCD screen (I would not expect this to hold up to regular use), as well as the overall body just felt cheap. And as for the body, the camera has a very unnatural feel while holding for shooting due to its layout of controls and pop out flash. Plus it&rsquo;s quite heavier and bigger than the Panasonic I mentioned. In summary I really, really, tried giving this camera a chance but I just could not become satisfied enough with it to keep. I had to return it after a solid week of testing. I feel like this camera was rushed to market, had too many flaws, and is overpriced for what you get.</p>

<h5 id="lcd-screen-problem">LCD screen problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The LCD screen glitched out from the first time I used it. I sent it in for repair and the company said it showed &ldquo;evidence of tampering, all the screws are missing.&rdquo; Because there was also a small crack on the screen Nikon wouldn&rsquo;t replace it, refund my money, or fix it for free. I spent 2 months trying &amp; they only offered me a 15% discount on the $180+ repair.</p>
