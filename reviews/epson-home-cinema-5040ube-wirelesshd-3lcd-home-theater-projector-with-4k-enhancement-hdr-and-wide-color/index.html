<h5 id="pristine-1080p-and-stunning-4k">Pristine 1080p and stunning 4k!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I upgraded from a 5030UB to the 5040UB. The 5030UB is great but lacks, of course, 4k enhancement. I have it mounted from the ceiling so the larger size is not an issue for me. It is 17&rsquo; from my 150&rdquo; screen and I sit 15&rsquo; from the screen. My theater is completely light-controlled with no windows. I have Dish and a PS3 for streaming. Currently, my only 4k source is 4k recordings of the Rio Olympics.In many 1080i programs, I see no difference in the picture quality. Newscasts, however, are better. I don&rsquo;t know why the difference.On most Blu-rays, I see little to no difference. The 5030UB and the 5040UB are both pristine in 1080p. In some, The Pacific, for example, the picture quality is somewhat better on the 5040UB. I don&rsquo;t know why the difference.Turning to my only source for 4k (currently), I was immediately stunned and elated by the picture quality! I have basketball, track and field, and swimming recorded from the Rio Olympics on Dish&rsquo;s 4k channel. The picture is stunningly clear! Bright, clear, and colors pop. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the Panasonic DMP-UB700 and Oppo UDP-203 UHD players. Based on the Olympic recordings, 4k discs should look astounding. I cannot currently test the HDR capability.The 5040UB has other improvements over the 5030UB, including remote-controlled lens control (far superior to the manual controls on the 5030UB) and slightly more light output at 2500 lumens. This is so bright that I can run in ECO mode and it is still plenty bright (though in a completely darkened room).Unfortunately, at 34 hours, the lamp refused to turn on. However, Epson&rsquo;s warranty is fantastic as after just a 10-minute phone call, Epson had a brand new unit in my hands the next day at no cost to me.I will update this review after I test it with a 4k disc. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve included several photos. The Oblivion shots are on Dish 1080i. The Olympics shots are in Dish 4k.UPDATE: I swapped my PS3 for a new Roku 4k and the Oppo UDP-203. UHD image quality very much depends on the source. At best, the picture quality of my 5040UB, on my 150&rdquo; screen, makes it look like a clear window that I can step through, including on Dish 4k or even UHD nature YouTube videos. There is a noticeable improvement in resolution (or perceived resolution) between 1080p and UHD, but the bigger difference is between SDR and HDR. Colors in HDR are much more vibrant, though to offset the darker image in HDR mode I have to change to Cinema Bright mode, and I often choose to switch from HDR2 to HDR1 mode. UHD movies look great but so far it seems most discs are upconverted from a 2k intermediary so the resolution improvement is modest, However, the improvement from SDR to HDR is significant.</p>

<p>First, props to Amazon for excellent customer care. I pre-ordered this product, since it was coming out Aug 22nd, 2016. I got it from Amazon Aug 23rd. I rushed home from work, ripped out my old Mitsubishi 6800HC, adjusted the ceiling mount and installed this all my own. I was so damn excited. As soon as I powered it on, i saw the Epson logo popup&hellip; then all of a sudden, the shutter closed and the temp + power light were flashing. It was for sure not hot, waited a while, tried again. I called Epson premiere support, which they give you a contact number in the box where you get an expert for these higher end systems. The guy didnt even know about the 5040UB yet. Went through the troubleshooting guide, and he determined it was a bad sensor. He told me Epson would advance replace to me at no cost. I was thankful for the excellent customer service, but told him I bought it Via amazon, and i know that they will get me one soon!. That was on Tuesday. I received the replacement one Aug 25th from Amazon. This time, I powered it up before going through the mounting process. Worked like a charm. Few things I didnt know, that I think is very cool.- When you power on/off this device a shutter opens and closes. I can only imagine thats to protect from dust. My other one was loaded with it!- Its quiet. Its mounted about 10 feet above my head. Didn&rsquo;t bother me at all.- Color &ndash; OMG! Played battlefield 4 on the Xbox One from 6pm to 12pm last night.- Clarity. So damn clear.- Lens - this was really cool. I My previous projector didn&rsquo;t have a center mounted lens. So when I mounted this one, i just had to use the lens shifting option, and it squared in my screen.- Daylight - I struggled with my previous projector when the curtains were open or any light would come in. I opened up the blinds, and it was still very vibrant.- Contrast - 1m to 1 dynamic &ndash; I was cautious about it. but man, Black is black.- Game play, I couldn&rsquo;t detect any lag, and coincidentally had one my of my best rounds of Battlefield 4.- Menu has many options. Many I am not sure I would ever use!- Picture posted below, had curtains open behind me. The screen was so vibrant, that it looks like they were closed!I haven&rsquo;t had this projector for 24 hours yet, but will update my review as I find out cool new things.</p>
