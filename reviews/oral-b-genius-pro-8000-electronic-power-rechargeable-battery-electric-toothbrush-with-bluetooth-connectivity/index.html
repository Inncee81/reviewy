<h5 id="impressive-cleaning-and-whitening-results-and-can-automatically-order-replacement-heads-via-amazon">Impressive cleaning and whitening results and can automatically order replacement heads via Amazon!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used regular toothbrushes my entire life, but at the recommendation of my new dentist, I looked into an electric tooth brush. I asked my dentist if she had a recommendation, but she more or less said that any electric toothbrush will likely be better than a manual toothbrush, but that she personally uses a Sonicare tooth brush that&rsquo;s a few years old. With that in mind, down the rabbit hole if internet researching I went.I wanted something with a pressure sensor. I like to lift heavy things at the gym and have a tendency to strong arm everything, including brushing my teeth which apparently may have contributed to some gum erosion. The current top model Sonicare (DiamondClean Platinum) does not have a pressure sensor. However, the FlexCare Platinum Connected does come with a pressure sensor. Oral-B models from the 1000 up have a pressure sensor. Based on price, I elected to compare the Sonicare FlexCare Platinum Connected to the current top model Oral-B, Genius Pro 8000.First, I asked two friends who are dentists what they prefer. One friend strongly recommended the Sonicare FlexCare+, stating that the top of the line models are not any better. The other provided a similar recommendation to my dentist - either one will be a huge improvement over a manual brush. So slight tilt to the Sonicare at this point. Very slight because not much detail was provided as to why the Sonicare was better. Just a &ldquo;trust me, get this&rdquo; endorsement.Next I searched for any studies comparing rotary (Oral-B) to oscillating (Sonicare) power brush heads. I won&rsquo;t post links to all the scientific studies I read, but the are quite a few on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) site. The more recent ones favor rotary brush heads.Point Oral-B.Then I compared features -Pressure Sensor: Oral-B has visible and tactile feedback (flashes light and pulses motor). Sonicare only provides tactile feedback (vibrates handle).Strokes/movements per minute: Oral-B (48,800 movements/min), Sonicare (31,000 strokes/min, 62,000 movements/min)Connected App: Both have some form of app that helps you hit all areas of your mouth consistentlyBrush Heads: Oral-B has 5 available brush heads and comes with three (cross action, whitening, and sensitive brush heads), Sonicare has 5 available brush heads and comes with two (AdaptiveClean, InterCare)Battery Life: Sonicare claims up to 2 weeks, Oral-B claims up to 12 daysPoint Oral-B.I then looked up subjective factors. In particular, I was interested in comparing noise levels. I looked up videos on Youtube, and there&rsquo;s no question that the Sonicare has a more pleasant buzzing sound vs. the more mechanical sound of the Oral-B.Point Sonicare.I considered travel convenience since I am on the move a lot. Both come with travel cases. Oral-B is a nicer looking black case. The Oral-B is made by Braun, and the travel charger uses the same kind of plug as my Braun Series 9.Point Oral-B.Finally, cost. Oral-B is cheaper up front by about $50 including all applicable discounts and manufacturer coupons at present. The Oral-B brush heads are also cheaper.Point Oral-B.So, I bought the Oral-B. I have used the app, and while it has some annoyances, the ability to track my toothbrushing habits is cool. I am a tech nerd after all. Reminders for flossing and mouthwash are on by default, but you can disable them. A suction mount to hold your phone on your bathroom mirror is included. I also like that you can setup the app to automatically order replacement brush heads through Amazon when the one you&rsquo;re using at the end of its life. I found the overall noise to be more than tolerable, but there&rsquo;s also usually music playing in my home no matter the hour.Of course, the big question is, how well does it clean teeth? Very well apparently! My teeth were noticeably whiter after 1 week using only the standard cross action head. I will likely try the whitening head at some point in accordance with the whitening program in the app. The brush head has visible movement, in contrast with the Sonicare which has more movements, but they are smaller movements, and only linear movements.I&rsquo;m very pleased with my purchase. Unless you&rsquo;re averse to the sound the Oral-B makes, it&rsquo;s handily the best brush on the market right now.</p>

<h5 id="the-toothbrush-gotham-deserves">The toothbrush Gotham deserves&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;I feel like this thing should be hanging on Batmans utility belt, not just chillin&rsquo; in the corner of my bathroom counter. When my dentist told me I needed an electric toothbrush I did not expect to buy a hand held Cadillac. I ordered this thing on Amazon and I opened it today, and you will not believe what in fresh hell this thing comes loaded with. This thing has 6 different modes, 6 different heads, wireless charging, a charging travel hard case, customizable LED colors (your choice of 12), Bluetooth connectivity, pressure detectors, and all of it connects to an app with facial recognition technology to tell you spots you&rsquo;ve missed and tips while it suspends your phone with a military grade suction cup you put on your bathroom mirror. In short? My new toothbrush has more features and bad ass specs than my freaking car&hellip;and half of the gadgets in my house combined. Is this what the future looks like? Blue tooth toothbrushes?! Side note, I got a 1,000 watt smile instantly!</p>

<h5 id="sleek-look-excellent-performance-not-as-solid-feeling-sounding-as-older-models">Sleek look; excellent performance; not as solid feeling/sounding as older models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, this is an excellent toothbrush when it comes to performance. Like all other Oral-B models, the Genius 8000 model does an outstanding job of cleaning teeth, and offers a wide range of speed/cycle options to ensure it fits as many needs as possible. However, it is not all that impressive with regard to build quality compared with older Oral-B models and has a more raucous sound when operating. The app is more capable than ones from Sonicare, but still remains a “frill” rather than a really useful utility.The overall appearance of this model is very sleek. It’s all black, and looks less utilitarian than most other electric brushes. The downside of the black finish is that it highlights every little spec of toothpaste that gets flung about when using the brush, and also shows water spots after washing. So, if you’re a stickler for a super pristine look, be prepared to wipe this down often.The brush body is very lightweight, which is a plus if you have older hands. However, it does feel less sturdy than older Oral-B models. I know that does not necessarily translate into lower durability/longevity, but it may be contributing to the operating sounds. This is louder and more “grinding” sounding than older models regardless of the mode selected.It has the “Smart Ring” which is a band around the handle at the base of the brush head that provides visual feedback as to timing and pressure. It’s a useful feature but can be a bit annoying at times. I have to say I still find the external monitor from the older Pro models to be more to my liking than the Smart Ring.It comes with three different brush heads, and is compatible with the full range of Oral-B heads. For me, that’s always been Oral-B’s main advantage over Sonicare. I prefer the shape and size of the Oral-B heads (they are usually round) plus they are usually less expensive than Sonicare heads.One outstanding improvement over older models is the use of a Li-ion battery. It avoids the memory effect of other types of rechargeable batteries, and provides consistent power right up until it’s empty.The app shows improvements over Oral-B’s initial efforts, and I find it to have a better look and feel than the Sonicare app. If having an app track your brushing gets you to brush more, great. For me, these apps are something to play with once and then never use again for two reasons: I don’t find they provide any more useful info than I get from the Smart Ring; and 2) I usually don’t have my phone in the bathroom. But, if you’re partial to integrating an app into your brushing routine, it’s available.While I still find the best value in Oral-B brushs are their older models (such as the Pro 5000 or 3000) this remains a good option if you like extra bells and whistles. While it loses a star due to the operating sound and build quality (considering the price point), it is otherwise a good performer.</p>

<h5 id="really-powerful-clean-machine">Really powerful clean machine!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this toothbrush because it really does work better than my Phillips Sonicare for cleaning my teeth. I can&rsquo;t get it to pair with Bluetooth but I really don&rsquo;t need that feature. I love that it doesn&rsquo;t turn off after the cycle so I can continue brushing until I feel my teeth are clean. It has a lot of power and one area of my mouth the hygienist said needed special care bleed when I first started using it but not anymore. I think my hygienist will notice a big difference. I sure do. She sells the Phillips Sonicare so she promotes that one. Maybe this will change her mind.</p>
