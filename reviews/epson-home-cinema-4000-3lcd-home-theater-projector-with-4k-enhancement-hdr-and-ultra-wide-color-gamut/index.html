<h5 id="stunning-display-flexible-set-up-super-bright">Stunning display, flexible set up, super bright</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is so much to love about this projector.I&rsquo;m not new to projectors. I&rsquo;ve had an Optoma 720p projector back in the day (2005). Then I upgraded to a JVC RS1 1080p projector (2008). Then I got out of projectors for a while. I recently got an Epson 2040 (Dec 2016). I thought wow, this is the best projector I&rsquo;ve ever owned. Until I got this Epson Home Cinema 4000.Absolutely stunning&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Not true 4K, but still amazingStandard def looks great.1080p is beautiful.And the limited 4K I&rsquo;ve had a chance to watch is stunning.This thing is very bright. I use it with ambient light and it looks fantastic. See the picsBeautiful 3D with the brightness to back it up&hellip;..I use the older version of these glasses (2x Pair) Samsung Rechargeable 3D Active Glasses, BlackI streamed some offerings from Amazon video through Amazon prime. You read that right, Amazon offers 4K content included with a prime membership!!! Now there&rsquo;s not a ton, but it is there.Currently I&rsquo;m streaming through my Xbox One S. It&rsquo;s also our 4K DVD player.When I put an Avatar Blue Ray in the Xbox, a screen popped up on my screen saying we detect you have a 4K display. Would you like to set your resolution to 4K? Uhm, yes please!!! Now this told me that my Xbox, my Sony STRDH1080 (Sony STRDN1080 7.2 Channel Dolby Atmos Home Theater AV Receiver), and Amazon basics HDMI cable, and my new Epson Home Cinema 4000, were all communicating via HDCP 2.2 compliance.Setup was not exactly plug and play from my Epson 2040 to my Epson 4000. I had to come up with a new mounting solution. This 4K is big. It weighs 3 times what the 2040 weighed and its probably 3 times the size as well. The old ceiling mount would not do. So I built a ceiling mounted box style shelf. It still needs to be trimmed out and painted, but in the interest of getting this projector going and putting some hours on it, I decided to go for function over form.My set up is pretty basic. I have a 16 by 29 room with an 8 foot ceiling. I have a throw distance from lens to screen of 11 feet. (10&rsquo;9&rdquo; is the absolute closest you can be, lens to screen, in order to get a 110&rdquo; screen size, see the pic from PJ central) I&rsquo;ll include a screen shot from my projector central app, of the screen size options and perspective brightness.Even though the Epson 2040 and the Epson 4000 are rated at similar lumens, the 4000 offers nearly double the foot lamberts of brightness. I&rsquo;ve posted some photos of a 110 inch image, with every light in the room turned on, and the image speaks for its self.(Please note in the photo, there is one light that is a dummy light. I rewired the room with can lights. I used the original light as the power source and I simply left the fixture in place to cover the hole until I finish my remodel of this room. Then the old fixture will be removed and appropriate trim will replace it. I switched to all can lights because my ambient light rejecting screen does great fighting indirect light, but direct light washes out any image.) I currently use an Elite screen cinegrey 3D material (Elite Screens Designer Cut, 135-inch 16:9, ALR DIY Ambient Light Rejecting Projector Screen Material, ZRM-135H-CINEGREY3D). It&rsquo;s stretched over a homemade 110 frame. See build photos below. Full room brightness (all room lights on) does not allow a very immersive viewing experience (daarkness adds to your immersion into the movie watching experience), but it&rsquo;s (some light) normal for sports and such. This projector handles full room brightness just like a flat screen TV. See my pics for evidence. From my perspective it&rsquo;s impressive!!Probably my favorite feature of this 4000 is the electronic lens shift. This is a feature missing from my previous Epson 2040 (no lens shift at all), it is also missing from the directly competing Optoma UHD60 (similar price point as the Epson 4000) The Epson goes one up and not only offers lens shift, but it offers electronic lens memory. So you can save lens settings. The projector will move the image around based on your situation. This could be useful for ultra wide screen format versus 16:9 among other factors.Lens shift allows you to mount the projector in a convenient location and then move the image to the most ideal position, from the comfort of your seat. In my case, my projector is mounted on a shelf, to the ceiling, giving me 7 feet 2 inches of head clearance, and the image fits perfectly on my 54 inch tall by 96 wide (110 inch diagonal) screen, which is hung at the appropriate height for my room set up and viewing height.My former 2040 had to be mounted around 6 feet 3 inches from the floor. This poses a bumping hazard. A jumping temptation for my minions. And it also allows shadow casting when walking between the PJ and the screen. Any front PJ will have shadow casting, but the higher the PJ the closer to the screen you&rsquo;ll have to be to cast a shadow.The Epson 2040 and the Epson 4000 use a very similar power cord. So, if like me, your power cable is glued in place (spray foam to seaal the attic space), you can plug it right in to the 4K. They do have closely related throw distances, though the screen size is going to be slightly larger for the 4000 than the 2040 at the identical throw distance. I highly suggest you use a distance calculator before ordering, if you&rsquo;re mounting location and screen size are fixed.So far the Epson 4000 is quiet, and operates fast. It&rsquo;s picture is stunning. It&rsquo;s set up is simple once you accommodate and account for its size and weight. Ironically even though it is so much larger than my previous pj, it&rsquo;s elevated mounting position makes it less obtrusive in the room. That is also fantastic. Don&rsquo;t under estimate the value of lens shift.The Epson 4000 has really 1 direct competitor, but there are 3 additional models of projectors with in $700 of its MSRP.Optoma UHD60&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..single chip DLP&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;some (but not) viewers can experience rainbow effect from DLP projectors, thsi can cause headaches, and can also be distracting. So make sure you are not subject to it if you choose a DLP projector.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;from Projector central via engadget, &ldquo;As Projector Central points out, the new DLP processor in the UHD60 uses a bit of trickery to achieve a 4K resolution. It&rsquo;s not natively UHD, instead it uses 2,716 by 1,528 mirrors (the DLP equivalent of pixels) and some custom video processing to double that resolution.&ldquo;Epson 4000 &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.3 chip LCDOptoma UHD65&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;single chip DLP&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..this is the pro model of the Optoma UHD60&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;this is essentially the same as the Optoma UHD60, but its black versus white, and has some different video processing, giving it better specs.Epson 5040&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.3 chip LCD&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..sort of the pro version of the 4000 (but not really)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-the Epson 5040 is several hundred higher than the 4000, and it uses very similar hardware. According to Projector reviews, the primary difference is the LCD panels. These will offer superior contrast ration in the more expensive 5040. They also say the visual evidence is only evident in a perfectly light controlled room. (In my situation, I have 3 windows, with black out curtains, and I have a multi-purpose room. So full room light control is only available after my minions go to bed.) This was not a huge priority for me, especially at the higher price point.In the end, if you are deciding between the offerings I mentioned above, I would weigh the specs, the warranty and service.I have owned projectors from both manufacturers. All of my recent projectors came from Epson, because of their fantastic warranty, reputation for reliability, and price.Epson has an amazing 2 year warranty. If you have a problem, give them a call. Their tech support will walk you through some settings. If that fails, they will ship you out a new projector, with a postage paid box to return the defective projector. They will do this for 24 months after your purchase. So you wont be with out a projector for very long. I really appreciate a company that stands behind its products, and minimizes the inconvenience to its customers. It is a big reason why I shop Amazon.this is the replacement bulb for the Epson Home Cinema 4000 Epson V13H010L89 Elplp89 Projector Lamp - Uhe Projector Accessoryand here is the bulb, if you are capable of removing a few screws and plugging in your own bulb you can save over half Replacement For EPSON V13H010L89 BARE LAMP ONLY Replacement Light Bulblamp life is rated at 3500 hours on full power, and 5000 hours on eco. This projector is bright, so eco mode should work for most folks.Update:My frame build is form December. I initially built it for my Epson 2040. It is made from 1x4 pine, and 2x4 pine dimensional lumber. The goal was a zero bezel picture that looks like it pops off the wall and floats on a cloud of LED light. The Epson 2040 was a bit hard to dial in to get the image perfectly on the zero bezel screen. But all the controls offered on the Epson 4000 allowed me to get the image perfectly placed on the screen with no keystone correction. The video-philes hate keystone correction, &ldquo;too much image degradation&rdquo;. I personally am not visually tuned enough to see it, but I believe them.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="dead-after-2-months-epson-agreed-to-replace">Dead After 2 Months, Epson Agreed to Replace</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Original Review: (1 star) The machine that we received is not a good product. We mounted this on the ceiling of a conference room, and it would not work with most of the laptops that we connected to it. Yesterday morning, just after its 2 month birthday, it would no longer power on. It was nice when it worked, but that wasn’t very often, and now that is not at all. I highly recommend you shop elsewhere for something better. Very disappointing for an Epson product, we have all adjusted our opinions of Epson, I give it one star because I can’t give it zero.Edited Review: (4 stars) I am upgrading to 4 stars, since a colleague called Epson, and with a little arm twisting, they agreed to replace the projector. Thanks Epson!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-reasonably-priced-flat-panel-alternative-for-poor-light-controlled-rooms">Great reasonably priced flat panel alternative for poor light controlled rooms</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me get this out of the way first:The EPSON Home Cinema 4000 does do HDR at 4k but only at 30FPS. This means no video game HDR at 4k, but this isn&rsquo;t a concern for me, and if you are looking at this projector it probably isn&rsquo;t a concern for you either. I will explain more later.Second: This isn&rsquo;t true 4k, but it looks pretty amazing regardless and I would surprised if someone could tell from reasonable viewing distance that it wasn&rsquo;t true 4k. Real 4k projectors are expensive, or DLP based (which I avoid, you can look up the plus and minus of DLP vs. LCD projectors) so this is a good balance in terms of picture quality and cost.This is one of the few projectors out there that is reasonably priced that can be a decent flat-screen alternative. It is incredibly bright even on Eco and easily works as a living room projector with the blinds open. It is quiet, starts up reasonably fast, is super easy to get setup with the motorized zoom, focus, and lens vertical and horizontal shift. It has to be one of the most flexible projectors in terms of where you can place it. I have it on top of a tall shelf, but it can be ceiling mounted. With lens shift it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be perfectly square (although I would recommend this if you can do it).If you use your projector in mixed lighting environment and can&rsquo;t make the room completely black don&rsquo;t bother trying to find a 4k 60FPS with HDR projector. HDR in these rooms is almost useless. There simply is not enough contrast in a dim to bright room to make HDR useful. You will do what I did and turn off HDR. HDR might be fine for a 4k movie at night with very minimal room light, but this would still be ok with this model since a vast majority of 4k movies are 24fps or 30fps which means this would provide you a 4k HDR experience for movies.If you have a pitch black room for your projector you shouldn&rsquo;t be looking at this model. The EPSON 5400UB or something more expensive with 4k 60FPS HDR is what you want.READ MORE</p>
