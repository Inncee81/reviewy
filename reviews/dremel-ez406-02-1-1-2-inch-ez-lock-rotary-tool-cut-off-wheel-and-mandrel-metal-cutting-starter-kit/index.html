Easy 1-2-3 Bit Changes Without a Screwdriver
Compatible with all Dremel rotary tools, the EZ406 is the first patented system of its kind. It makes accessory changes as easy as one, two, three. Just pull, twist, and release! Its one-piece mandrel design eliminates the need for a screwdriver and simplifies the process of changing cutting wheels, making it a snap to cut through a range of materials from metal to plastic.
One-Piece Design for Quick Wheel Changes
The EZ406 EZ Lock Starter Kit contains the EZ402 mandrel and five EZ456 cutt-off wheels. The innovative, one-piece design of the EZ402 mandrel makes it easy to EZ Lock compatible accessories&ndash;even when you&rsquo;re wearing gloves! With the EZ402, locking and loading is an effortless process that does not require holding the cut-off wheels in place with a screw. This saves you the worry of losing those tiny mandrel screws, and it saves you the time spent using a wrench to tighten them.</p>

<p>Long-Lasting, Labeled Cut-Off Wheels
Designed for reliable performance year after year, the EZ406 includes five EZ456 cut-off wheels that last two times longer than fiberglass-reinforced cut-off wheels. They also lock in place quickly and are labeled for easy identification to ensure you have the right wheel for the job.</p>

<p>Versatile Design for Flexibility
This set gives you the flexibility and solid performance you need to complete a range of hobby, repair, and renovation tasks. Use the EZ406 to cut through metal conduit and PVC piping, re-slot screw heads, remove rusty nail heads, or tackle light demolition jobs. With the EZ406 you can also cut aluminum and power through nuts and bolts.</p>

<p>About Dremel: A History of Brilliance and Innovation
Founded in 1932 in Racine, Wisconsin, Dremel is the industry leader in rotary tools. The company owes its success to the inventive genius of its founder and namesake, Albert J. Dremel. In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.</p>

<h5 id="i-guess-they-are-okay">I guess they are okay&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It might be possible that I am using these for a tougher job than they are rated for. I am trying to cut a pipe from a since removed radiator system for an old house and so far I have gone through 2 of these for one pipe. I ordered another set that specifies for metal cutting on them. Other than the fact that they are wearing down so fast to almost nothing&hellip;.I would say they are okay for anything not metal or just a tiny bolt or something but nothing heavy duty. I was using this to cut a non functional pipe that is about 1 to 2 cm from the wall. A sawzall will not get in that space without me cutting the wall to pieces. We&rsquo;ll see how the other set goes. For anything else, even copper pipes this is fine. It does cut through other things like butter with no real effort needed. I will purchase these again, but for smaller metal cutting jobs and other substances like plastic or wood or thin metal.</p>

<h5 id="makes-quick-work-of-nails-or-stainless-steel-bolts-if-you-don-t-have-a-pair-of-uber-bolt-cutters-or-angle-grinder">Makes quick work of nails or stainless steel bolts if you don&rsquo;t have a pair of uber bolt cutters or angle grinder!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit skeptical that what appeared to be just thicker versions of standard Dremel cutoff wheels would do much against a bolt. I was wrong! Works great, we had a Dremel tool clone, but no uber bolt cutters or angle grinder, so this is in our rolling toolbox now with a battery powered Dremel clone! The quick change feature is nice, still a bit of a challenge but better than the tiny little screws on the arbor which are constantly dropping off the workbench when changing cut-off wheels!Suggestion: use only with a plugged in Dremel tool or clone, not a battery powered one. I ran through two battery packs in 10 minutes of cutting and had another 10 minutes to go!Pros:+ works very well against hardened steel up to 1&rdquo; diameter+ comparable function to an angle grinder right down to the sparks flying all over the place! So make sure to wear protective clothing! Slower than an angle grinder as you would expect!+ EZ lock is great compared to the wee little screws on the alternative Dremel cutoff wheel holdersCons:- not the fastest tool at cutting bolts, expect a minute or two for every <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; thickness up to about 1&rdquo; thick- EZ lock is still a bit of a challenge to change in the field</p>

<p>Got this kit to cut through some epoxies carbon fiber. Worked like a charm. As with any high speed cutting tool, there is a lot and i mean a lot of dust. Carbon fiber dust is no different then any other kind of dust&hellip; not good for you. I always wear a full face respirator.Â MSA Safety Works 10041139 Full Face Multi Purpose Respirator. when cutting with a rotary tool.</p>

<h5 id="terrrific-cut-off-system-for-small-bolts-screws-etc">Terrrific cut-off system for small bolts/screws, etc.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This system is infinitely better than the old cut-off disks that you had to screw into the end of the mandrel. The disks won&rsquo;t break like the cheap wafer cut-off disks, and are more durable than the fiberglass disks I used - where i would go through a half dozen disks, i now go through 1 or 2.I use this mostly with a Proxxon IB/E Professional to cut off mild steel bolt ends, screws, etc. flush with surfaces. Usually these are in the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; range or less. At this task it works great. I must have cut off 500 screw ends that extended through some flooring during a recent renovation project with one disk. I&rsquo;m still on my first box of cut off wheels- they last a lot longer than the less expensive cut off disks. I&rsquo;ve also used them on aluminum and cast iron with good effect.The disks are easy to change with the quick change collar - just pull back the spring loaded collar, insert the disk, rotate 90 degrees, then release collar. Even the little plastic container is functional. I&rsquo;ve had my EZ406 for several years now, and will never go back. This is one of Dremel/Bosch&rsquo;s finer ideas - Albert Dremel would be proud.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-actually-last">These actually last!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the more common cutting disks for Dremels, these wheels are durable and last. Most recently I used them to cut <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; rebar and they did a great job. My reciprocating saw with a nice new blade wasn&rsquo;t even making a dent trying to cut through so I figured I&rsquo;d try this even though I thought it was too heavy of a job for the disk. I was very pleasantly surprised when it cut the rebar without breaking at all and it hardly shows any wear. I wish I found these a long time ago.</p>

<h5 id="cutting-off-heavy-duty-nails">Cutting off heavy duty nails</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My neighbor built a chicken coop for me but the roofing nails were hanging down, waiting to impale one of my girls. I didnt want to invest in a sawzall, because I knew Id never use it again and I have a high speed Dremel. I tried wire cutters to no avail. While this threw sparks all over the place (which scared the crap out of me!) It cut right through those nails like butter, they were very hot when they flew off. Wear long sleeves and goggles if your cutting metal! It did take me a bit to figure out how to get it on the shaft. Even more frustrating after a few months and I had lost the directions! But I did figure it out. Shipping was great and right on time through Amazon. Great product for the price.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-a-homeowner">A must have for a homeowner.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Put these in my Dremel tool and boy do these things cut. Perfect for thin sheet metal. I can see a myriad of uses for these cut off wheels.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-mandrel">No mandrel?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks like good cutting wheels, but I wouldn&rsquo;t know for sure because they are useless to me without the mandrel that was supposed to be in the case, but wasn&rsquo;t there. Very disappointing. Will either have to order one, run to hardwire store or call Dremel.</p>
