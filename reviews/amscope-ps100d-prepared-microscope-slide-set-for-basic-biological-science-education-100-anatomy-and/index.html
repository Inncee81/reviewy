<p>Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.</p>

<p>United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-for-our-future-scientist">Perfect for our future scientist!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered slide set D after much deliberation. I purchased the AmScope 40X-2000X Advanced Home School Student Biological Compound Microscope with Mechanical Stage, Solid Metal Framework and Optical Glass Lenses in January. The 100 slide set D had great variety and seemed a perfect fit for our six year old scientist who is interested in insects and a variety of animals and birds.The slides arrived in perfect condition and as everyone else says the wooden box they come in is very sturdy and designed well to hold the slides securely. Others commented on a little dust or film. Ours were quite clear and that would not bother me anyway. The price is phenomenal. The slides and the microscope are so superior to the toys sold in our local store that I would not hesitate to purchase another for my other granddaughter. The &ldquo;real thing&rdquo; is somewhat more expensive, but will provide a lifetime of knowledge.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-kids">A must have for kids.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so fun! I think I play with them more than my daughter lol It has sooo many things to look at. There is hours of microscope fun in these. All kids should have these and microscopes in their rooms! Would be perfect for homeschooling or teachers looking to supplement their teachings, or just a curious kid. Give them something awesome to look at and do. They get to see things from a whole new perspective. It always has my daughter asking tons of questions when she brings hem out. He always amazed at every slide. Shes 11. They are all numbered and labeled so you can put them back in the right slots and know what you are looking at. My daughter spilled her case in he floor and nothing broke and it only took up a few minutes to get it all organized again. The case is really nice and sturdy, very nice quality all the way around! I love the variety of everything in this kit. Hoping to get another set of slides soon!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-product-for-practicing-on-the-microscope">Excellent product for practicing on the microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product for practicing on the microscope. Kids are fascinated by the minute structures and learning with every view. Well made and labeled well too. Stores and protects the glass slides. Highly recommend it for your scientists in training.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-cool-slides">Super Cool Slides!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome, crazy assortment of slides, all of them really beautifully done and labeled, the case can get a little wonky if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kudos-to-amscope">Kudos to AmScope!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely BRILLIANT: what an awesome set of slides!!! We&rsquo;ve had a ball looking at locust wings, rabbit blood &amp; bits of dog tissue amongst other things. Definitely worth the expense, which considering the range of different slides &amp; the amount in the box, isn&rsquo;t that expensive. 100 Anatomy &amp; Botany slides professionally created for less than $50 is a steal &amp; a must have for any science enthusiast with a microscope. My son has been so overwhelmed by this early Xmas gift, Kudos to AmScope!!</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-little-slide-box">Really nice little slide box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Frantic slide set. Really great quality. Kids love looking at these.Only thing would be to laminate the description card and to have the slides numbered not just have the descriptions listed. Would make returning slides to the box easier with numbers</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wonderful-product">Wonderful Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product was received in a timely manner and was exactly what I was expecting. The case is solid and all the slides are in perfect condition. This is a gift for christmas along with a telescope I purchased for my daughter who loves science.Very pleased with the quality and the value is unbeatable!</p>

<p>The box is a thin wood, but all of the slides arrived unbroken and look great. Each slide is labeled with the contents on the slide and there&rsquo;s a handy index.</p>
