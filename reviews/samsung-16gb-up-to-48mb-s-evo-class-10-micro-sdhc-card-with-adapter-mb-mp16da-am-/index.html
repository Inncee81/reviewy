<p>Save your precious memories - fast. This ultra high speed memory card is UHS-1 enabled, which means it captures photos and video two times faster than your typical microSD. With a transfer speed of up to 48 MB per second, you can spend less time transferring memories, and more time making them.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-price-performance-ratio">Good price performance ratio.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the 16 GB version for an ODroid C1+ (similar to Raspberry Pi 2). I wanted something cheap but decent performance and this was probably the best deal going. I may try a 32 GB model next time since it&rsquo;s only slightly more expensive.I ran Crystal DiskMark and I have attached the screenshot for the results.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="speedy-card">Speedy Card!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Popped it in to my BLU R1 HD (16GB Storage, 2GB RAM, with Amazon AD), and it automatically detected that it was Samsung EVO and gave me options to use. I chose portable media storage, and I was able to quickly transfer my music files to the card (it was really fast!), and there were no problems playing the music from it. After using it for a week, the phone accessing the files (music and pictures) was snappy. Whether the phone was rebooted, power off/on, the SD card had no glitches.NOTE: For smartphones, Class 10 micro SD card is a necessity for speed. If anything less than Class 10, the speed suffers and apps often stutter or lag (I tried my Class 4 micro SD card on the phone, and it was slow). So if you own a smartphone and use micro SD card, check whether you are using Class 4 or Class 10 (or above). You will see the difference in speed. With Samsung EVO (Class 10), you are good to go!All in all, I am very happy with the product (given the price point - $6.99). Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gift">Great gift!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got a new tablet for Mother&rsquo;s Day, so I did a factory re-install on my old Samsung tab 7. I wanted to give it to my g-granddaughter for her birthday, since she wanted one a lot, and always enjoyed playing on this one when I went back on vacation. Part of getting it ready for her was to get a new SD card. She won&rsquo;t be nine until October, but I wanted her to enjoy it this summer. Needless to say, she has already used it more in a month than I did in two years! This card has done an awesome job of storing all of her extra &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. We are both very happy with it. I really like, and trust, Samsung products.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-card-for-a-great-price">Great card for a great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great microSD card. 16Gb fit nicely into my Galaxy S3, and transferred just as easily to my Note3. It&rsquo;s actually not Class 10, and is UHS-1, which is faster (I think double the speed), but without actually benchmarking the read/write speeds to it I couldn&rsquo;t confirm it actually goes up that high. I can tell you that over two phones, and over a year of use, I have never noticed a slowdown because of it.I&rsquo;ve never lost files, and I&rsquo;ve easily slid it into an adapter and written to my hard drive to make a special backup.The price for this card was much cheaper than some of the equivalent Sandisk models. I don&rsquo;t know why, something about the EVO brand perhaps, but its been a great little card and I&rsquo;ll definitely look at the 32GB version when I upgrade next.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="basic-card-slow-data-transfer-works-perfectly-no-data-loss">Basic Card, Slow Data Transfer, Works Perfectly, No data loss</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a decent enough card. I use it in a Samsung Galaxy3 Mini that only has 8GB internal memory. I mainly save pictures and videos to it and a couple of games. I don&rsquo;t advise saving games to it or other applications because it is slow with a 48mb/s speed. Even so, it is not that horribly slow that I would stop using it. For the price and for my needs, it is a good enough card. I haven&rsquo;t received any errors, and have not lost any data. It seems to be working perfectly for quite a while now. At the time of purchase I was less knowledgeable about SD cards, and thought this was a good deal for eight bucks. Now I know that if you want more data transfer speed, look for something like the Samsung Data Pro class, with 90mb/s speed. The Evo only has 48mb/s which works for most picture and video saving, but again, is just slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-em-and-you-can-label-them">Love &lsquo;em - and you can LABEL them :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The price is right - no errors, fast, solid warranty. Having a dozen or so 32gb cards in my bag or in camera at any given moment, started to wonder why they were all so big when I rarely go over 11-12GB per camera even when shooting weddings, so got a few of these 16gb cards and could not be happier. None of the read errors or slow reads due to file errors I&rsquo;ve run into with the Sony cards. These are fast, and the plastic is WHITE so I can write on them with a fine point sharpie so I don&rsquo;t accidentally mix cards from one camera to another (formatting and indexing anomalies can ensue - don&rsquo;t ask me how I know)At least as fast as any other UHS1 card I&rsquo;ve tried, and at the price and with the ability to write on them, I&rsquo;ll be buying more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-plastic-carrying-case-but-perfect-other-than-that">No plastic carrying case, but perfect other than that.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered a small camera that required a Micro SD card. I did not know much about them other than the highest the class, the faster the card will process. Got on Amazon and saw this one for $7.99 and couldn&rsquo;t pass it up. Samsung (so it is name brand), put it in my camera and it worked like a charm. Comes with the SD adapter card&hellip; the on thing I wish is that it would have come with a plastic carrying card for the SD adapter card, which it did not. Other than that it was a great purchase and deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-what-i-need-it-to-do">Does what I need it to do.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace another SD card from another brand name company that died on me. It was the second one in a row so I thought I&rsquo;d go with Samsung this time. I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.Pros1. It works. Popped it in and worked without any weird reformatting nonsense.2. It is fast enough for what I need it for. I don&rsquo;t know the exact stats (as they probably vary anyway) but it&rsquo;s fast enough for my use cases (music doesn&rsquo;t stutter, video doesn&rsquo;t skip or stutter, video taken with the phone camera doesn&rsquo;t skip or stutter) so I have no complaints.3. It&rsquo;s inexpensive.4. The bright colors clash with every surface in my apartment which makes it really easy to find when you drop it. I consider that a pro.Cons1. None yet.Unless this thing dies, there are no real problems with it. I&rsquo;ll update my review if it does die but for now, I would recommend it.<strong>Update</strong>I purchased a 64GB card for my HTC One M9. Works like a charm without any issues again. I&rsquo;ll update if things go wrong with any of my Samsung cards, but both cards I&rsquo;ve purchased still currently work.READ MORE</p>
