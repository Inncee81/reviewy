</ul>

<p>This is a Fully Automatic Airsoft Gun, with 1:1 scale replica of the real steel from Germany. This electric airsoft gun is remarkably authentic. The AEG fires round 6mm plastic pellets known as BBs, which are propelled out of the gun by compressed air. The advantage of the airsoft machine gun, however, is that players can safely train, simulate, or play with the gun without fearing serious injury. The M85 looks, feels, weighs, and functions just like the real steel, but is built for casual recreation and fun. It is equipped with Variable Hop-up system which will up spin the BB to maximum velocity and shooting distance. For your safety, this airsoft gun is installed with a blazing orange tip. The M85 is considered a low-powered electric rifle (LPEG) due to the use of a plastic gearbox (PGB), making it an ideal entry-level introduction to electric airsoft guns. The M85&ndash;which shoots up to 260 fps&ndash;includes a battery, charger, flashlight, and electronic sight for a perfect all-in-one airsoft setup. You can select Shooting mode with Semi-Auto/ Full-Auto selectable. Fires 6mm ammo at approx. 260 FPS with 0.12g pellets. 500 rounds per min. Realistic Clip can hold 50 round capacity. Included Re-chargeable Battery 7.2V 700mAh and charger, adjustable electric red cross sight, safety glasses, airsoft tools and accessories, and starter BBs. BB&rsquo;s that are not fully polished will cause the airsoft gun to jam.</p>

<h5 id="great-gun-for-the-price">Great gun for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For $55, i couldn&rsquo;t be happier. It&rsquo;s a good sirsoft rifle, and it comes with all the bells and whistles and EVEN BATTERIES which is always nice.Accuracy is pretty good.Haven&rsquo;t had a problem with it yet, and i&rsquo;m definitely enjoying it so far</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="literally-one-of-the-best-guns-for-the-price">Literally one of the best guns for the price!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This gun is primarily for beginners but I have a good 3 years of experience at airsoft fields and backyard skirmishes and I still use it! This gun isn&rsquo;t the best with accuracy or fps but it shoots pretty fast and takes cheap ammo so with extra magazines(or a drum magazine) you can just spay as if there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. This gun is VERY durable, light, and the folding stock is amazing. The scope and silencer and basically worthless and just for looks, but the grip and flashlight are actually pretty good. Most of the bad reviews for this gun are people who broke the gun from being irresponsible with it. If you dont plan on using it as a football or something you&rsquo;ll be good.Pros:-Very durable-Battery life is amazing(about 8 hours or gameplay per charge)-Super easy to move quickly with on account of lightness-Takes super cheap ammo-Folding stock-Easy access to the batteryCons:-Can only shoot about 30 yards-Low fps(not too low though)-Not the best with accuracy-Mag only holds like 35 bbs(extra mags are very cheap to buy)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-airsoft-gun-get-extra-clips-though">Good Airsoft Gun - Get extra clips though</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves this thing, he mostly uses it for role play although he does actually go out in the back yard and shoots it. The one bad thing is that the clip doesn&rsquo;t hold a lot of ammo, you can hover clip multiple clips together and wear other clips on a belt/vest - Just keep that in mind while buying it that you will probably want to buy more clips. I will say that thanks to the clip design it does empty the clip without misfiring or having to shake the clip around like his other one</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="below-par-imo-but-seller-gave-prompt-and-fair-return">Below par IMO but seller gave prompt and fair return.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This gun seemed below par to my son who has had several guns growing up (now 18 yo). It did not shoot straight and felt flimsy with all the plastic. You get what you pay for so we ordered another one (at three times the price) but it is mostly metal (gears, external parts too) and performance is much better.In fairness to the seller, we returned the gun at no cost to us and was issued a prompt return so no complaints for trying it. A seller with honesty and integrity, again IMHO.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-gun">Good gun.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The gun shipped to us before it was said to shipping was perfect no damage to any parts. I also love that when I open the package all of the batteries were allready included. Flashlight was ok. Not very bright, But still does the job. The magazine was great holding about 30 rounds. Silencer did a little bit of silencing but not very noticeable. The scope was very nice but the only thing I had a problem with was the scope did not come with any bolts and I had to grab 0.5 cm hex bolts at Home Depot for just $.40. Favorite part of the gun was how great it&rsquo;s accuracy was. It hit the bucket about eight out of every 10 times from about 30 m away. Hop-up works great. And I&rsquo;ve had no jams so far. Overall great gun. Totally recommend it to people who are just starting airsoft.</p>

<h5 id="a-pretty-good-gun">A pretty good gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this gun the third day it was due to arrive. When i bought it i purchased new for $22.I&rsquo;ve had the gun for about a week now and it has exceeded my expectations. I would call myself an avid airsoft player (meaning i get serious about playin, but i don&rsquo;t pay big money for the most amazing guns). I&rsquo;ve done some target practice and been in one battle. I&rsquo;ll break down the pros and cons.Pros:-Attachments (the gun came with a flash hider, silencer, flashlight, foregrip, red dot sight, and a carrying strap)-Mag capacity ( it is not a Hi-cap mag, but it can hold 50 rounds)-Battery life ( It takes 3 hours of charge for three days of use)-&ldquo;weaver&rdquo; attachment rails ( 3 shorter rails on both sides and bottom and one long rail in between the front and rear sights on top)-the look ( all black with realistic looking bullets in magazine)- Dual mag system ( The magazines can lock together for faster change between mags (i suggest buying at least 2 extra mags if you plan to use in battle, I bought four and it worked great))- Folding stock ( when folded the gun is small to sling on your back comfortably, and when unfolded it gives added stability for greater accuracy0-Fps ( the fps is around 280 which for a $22 gun is awesome)Cons:-laser pointer ( some pictures and reviews said that there was also a laser attachment, but i did not get it, I wouldn&rsquo;t have used it anyway though so I don&rsquo;t care)-Effective range ( the BB will only go 25-30 yards accurately before veering in a random direction)-flashlight ( its good for use as a flashlight, but useless in airsoft even during the night because you just make yourself a target for people who are smart enough not to use a light)-red dot sight (it works fine and could be adjusted to be accurate, the battery died quickly and was a pain to look through before shooting )- Gear box ( it is hard to access the gear box and spring if you wanted to replace or modify something)Final notes:I suggest using the silencer even though it makes the gun bulkier because it improved the accuracy a little bit. I also suggest using the foregrip and carrying strap. For most airsofters i would suggest the gun mostly because my cons don&rsquo;t really apply to a lot of people&rsquo;s needs. Some people will say this gun &ldquo;sucks&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s only because they expected a $200 dollar quality and as great as the gun is its not that amazing. For any airsofter except the most extreme, Buy This Gun!- a review by Peeled~Carrots &ldquo;A 13 year old on a mission, a mission to peel carrots.&ldquo;45 day update: well I threw away most of the gun today because it broke. I had my buddy pinned and he was getting shot up pretty bad till my gun had to fail. After about a week of owning the gun the whole tip snapped of from a drop of 2 feet onto soft grass! Yesterday I finally opened up the gun to figure out what the problem was. Just note that this gun is not intended to be modifyed so unless you have a large amount of experience I would not suggest opening the gun at all. All of the internals are plastic, gears mounts, everything. The problem with my gun was that somehow the !PLASTIC! motor mount broke off. No matter how tightly I taped it the motor wouldn&rsquo;t stay so I just stripped the gun of everything and threw the rest away. I am going to try buying the gun one more time because 1. I already invested in the extra mags and 2. I took every replacement part I could so hopefully that will improve the life of the gun. I would still reccomend this gun to any begginer and maybe some intermediate backyard battlers, but the gun just can&rsquo;t stand up to the general wear and ttear of more serious play.-An Update By Peeled~Carrots &ldquo;A 13 year old on a mission, a mission to peel carrots.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For a cheap rifle, it&rsquo;s been all I needed for the past four years! Durable for the price, and the low velocity means I get into most fields with no hassle! It&rsquo;s so cheap that, if it gets broken or stolen, I don&rsquo;t really care; it&rsquo;s already paid for itself three times over with the amount of fun I&rsquo;ve had with it! In the event that someone finally does steal my rifle, or breaks my rifle, I&rsquo;m coming right back here for a new one!</p>
