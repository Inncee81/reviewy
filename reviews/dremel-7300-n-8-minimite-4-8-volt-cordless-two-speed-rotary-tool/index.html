<h5 id="great-for-trimming-dog-nails-accessories-do-fit">Great for trimming dog nails! Accessories DO fit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for filing my dogs nails! They have thick dark nails that grow quickly, this is the best way to trim their nails as short as possible without hurting the quick.Advice for tool newbies like me that thought the accessories do not fit- I almost returned it because I thought the collet was too small! The black piece is the collet nut, there&rsquo;s a smaller silver piece inside that is wider at the front, that is the collet. Maybe some people did receive the wrong collet, but for me this was not the case. If the item you received is like mine, right out of the box the collet was wedged into the collet nut so hard that the tip of the collet is too narrow to fit an accessory. Remove the collet nut (which brings the collet out too since its jammed in so hard). Use one of the accessory shafts to press down firmly on the collet, push until it falls out of the nut. Reinsert the collet loosely into the nut so that the opening does not tighten, now you should be able to fit the accessories! I hope that helps.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-on-thick-toenails">Works well on thick toenails!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My sister wanted this to file her own toe nails. We each have a battery operated device for our fingernails, and I have no problem with it on my toenails; however, my sister is 80 and her toenails are quite thick. She is delighted with this device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-tool-i-love-the-rechargeable-battery">Excellent tool, I love the rechargeable battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is another great Dremel product. It feels like it&rsquo;s high quality, and it works great. I&rsquo;ve noticed that some people have complained that the tool tip (I can&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s called) didn&rsquo;t fit into the tool, but you just have to know what&rsquo;s what. Use the end of the little wrench that&rsquo;s provided to push the silver part out of the center, then loosely put it back in, insert the tool tip (which fits once you&rsquo;ve released the pressure on the silver part), and re-tighten it. There are instructions on the book.As a professional dog trainer, I can say that it&rsquo;s important to let your dog get used to the sound - well away from him - for a few days before ever trying to do just one tonail. Having done this I appreciate that this is not a terribly loud tool, making the process easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="why-did-i-wait-so-long-to-buy-one">Why did I wait so long to buy one??</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE this tool. I&rsquo;ve used a regular corded Dremel on my dogs nails for years and thought I was happy but this is so nice to ditch the cord and it&rsquo;s much quieter than my corded one which means the dogs are not as anxietal by hearing it. The lower RPM also means it&rsquo;s not as jarring when it touches their nail and IF it happens to get snagged in hair it&rsquo;s not going so fast that it could hurt them. I felt horrible a few times on my corded one because it ripped hair out in an instant when it got caught up once or twice. I just wish I had bit the bullet and got one of these years ago. I had &ldquo;thought&rdquo; it would be a waste of money to duplicate a tool I already had</p>

<h5 id="great-for-trimming-dog-nails">Great for trimming dog nails!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 65 lb dog is a rescue and is terrified of having his nails clipped, presumably from past painful nail clipping experiences. He also has some black nails and even when I can get him to sit still for clippings I am not comfortable cutting them for fear of cutting the quick and traumatizing him further.I hated seeing him with long nails painfully clicking against the ground (and also scratching me during play-time). With a little bit of patience and conditioning, I trained him to sit still for his nail filing and now I can do two full paws in one sitting without him even caring (of course he knows he gets a big treat afterward)! His quicks are slowly receding and I file his nails back a little bit more every week&hellip;I do not even hear the click-clack of nails on our tile anymore.Recommendation for large dogs: Use the high setting and move from nail to nail so they do not get too hot100% best purchase! So much stress alleviated!Only downside I could see is that a new battery costs the same amount as buying a new unit, but the price is reasonable for this tool so not an issue for me. I am not sure about the battery life of a single charge as I put it on the charger for about an hour after each use.This is the same product as the Dremel specifically designed for pet nails, but this one comes with more variety of bits and I figure it will come in handy for other projects, too.Â Dremel 7300-PT 4.8V Pet Nail Grooming Tool</p>

<h5 id="great-dremel-would-recommend">Great Dremel! Would recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this dremel to use the sanding band as a nail file for my dog. His nails are too long and he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy going to the groomer to get them trimmed. The few times that we were able to get him to sit still and let us use this on his nails, it went great! Unfortunately, he has a lot of anxiety and is afraid of the noise. So we haven&rsquo;t gotten as much use out of it as I would like.That being said, the dremel itself is great. Easy to charge, easy to change the heads. It might not have worked out as well as I would have liked with my dog (only because he&rsquo;s easily scared, it would be great for a dog that is willing to let their nails be done), but now I have a new tool for me and I love it. Would highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bits-don-t-fit">Bits don&rsquo;t fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this and none of the bits fit. I wasted $25 for something I can&rsquo;t even use. Sending this back immediatelyUpdate (11/6/15)Sent the drill back and received a replacement. The second one was a major improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awful-battery">Awful battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery on this was just awful. I bought it because I loved the idea of having a dremel that wasn&rsquo;t attached to a cord so that I could carry it with me in my shop, but this just died way too fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Very good product - I use this to trim my Dogs nails, and it works perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="best-cordless-dremel">Best cordless dremel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to be able to trim/grind down my pets toe nails.. I couldn&rsquo;t justify spending $40 on the &ldquo;pet&rdquo; version of this dremel.. guess what..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-dogs-nails">GREAT for dogs&rsquo; nails!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Dremel&rsquo;s are the absolute best for filing my dog&rsquo;s nails. My last Dremel last for 18 years. This new model is even better with all the heads.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this to trim my dogs nails on a regular basis. The battery has held up and the speed is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="satisfied">Satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mini mate was just what I wanted after purchasing one before and wasn&rsquo;t what I needed. It was difficult for me at first on how to used the attachments. But finally learned how.</p>

<h5 id="purchased-it-just-to-do-dogs-nails-but-its-capable">purchased it just to do dogs nails but its capable &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>purchased it just to do dogs nails but its capable of so much more. DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TIPS DON&rsquo;T FIT. Yes they do!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-bueno">No Bueno!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a like if junk. Battery life is short, so buy lots of spares. I was more than disappointed with Dremel amd this particular product.</p>
