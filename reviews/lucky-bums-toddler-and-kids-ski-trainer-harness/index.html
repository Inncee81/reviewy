<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-children-learning-to-ski">A must have for children learning to ski</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two of these (for children 3 &amp; 5), and we love them. It is so easy to pick the kids up with the handle in the back when they fall. the handle is also great for sitting on the lift, because you have a hand on the kids at all time. The leashes are awesome for letting the little ones think they are going down the hill at their own pace. The little backpack compartment makes it easy to tuck away the leashes quickly before getting back on the lift (or if you are on an easier trail that your kids dont need the leashes for)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-cool-little-product">This is a cool little product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You will only use this for half a season for skiing and the rest of the time is to tow your slow kid to the lift. It is most useful for lifting your child onto chair lift. When your kid gets braver you need to extend the leashes, because you will carry too much speed to stop with the short leashes. I am embarrassed to say I used my two 6&rsquo; dog leashes to extend it. But it worked. This product will last through all of your children.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handle-is-better-than-the-straps">Handle is better than the straps</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a handy little thing to have when teaching incompetent little skiers. I used this with my 3 and 6 year old and the best feature is really that there is handle on the back that allows you to lift your child onto the chair lift and then to subtly but surely hold them there safely as if you&rsquo;ve got your arm around their back as they fidget 50 feet up in the air (you can tell I don&rsquo;t trust my kids up there). It is also very helpful to pick up the fallen, whining little skiers up off the slope.As for the straps, I agree with one of the other reviews that they end up being as much a hindrance as a help. Skiers are meant to lean forward to place pressure on their skis but when you pull on the straps to slow your child down you end hauling them backwards and throwing off that balance a little. I also found that the handles are too short and that if you get even a little speed going then if your kids whipes out you run the risk of running right over them (that happened once which was more than enough). I found that linking the two straps together (thus doubling the distance from my child as we skied) and attaching it to the back handle worked better at letting them ski freely but be able to go down most basic trails and not build up too much speed.Overall worthwhile for piece of mind on the slopes but definitely not a ski &ldquo;trainer&rdquo; as they get no technique from this and you really can&rsquo;t help guide their turns.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-beginners">Good for Beginners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Neither my husband nor I don&rsquo;t agree with parents who leash their children on the street. Having said that, it did take a few talks for him to consider us hooking our kids up to these straps, but the idea gave me piece of mind that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly uncontrollably down the hill, into a tree and be hurt. Parents beware, if you use these, it takes arm and back strength and stamina to do a full day with a 40 lbs child with these on. To me, it was a safety issue. The straps are not too long, as to get tangled up and hurt anyone, if used properly and putting them on was easy. You&rsquo;ll be sore at the end of the day, but your child will be safe and sound.I would recommend these for beginners, but take it slow.</p>

<h5 id="this-thing-was-great-the-harness-w-handle-was-perfect">This thing was great. The harness w handle was perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took my almost-3 year-old skiing for the first time. This thing was great. The harness w handle was perfect, allowing me to lift him up to get on the lift, to lift him getting up after a fall. That alone get&rsquo;s this guy 4 stars. The &lsquo;reigns&rsquo; were also super helpful in controlling his speed. However, small connect strap that connects the reigns to the harness broke, after i tried to lift him up after a fall with the reigns. See pict. The instructions do NOT say not to do this. I was able to attach the reigns to the handle, so functionally, it still works the same. But the fact that the product broke on the 2nd day was a little disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-star-product">5 star product!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked perfect!! We got it for my daughter who just turned 3. She was going down the green and blue hills her first time. We also got something that keeps her skies together. It was a Edgie Wedgie. The two of them working together made skiing so easy. Your back doesn&rsquo;t hurt and you can even turn them and teach them to go back and forth down the hill. We are very impressed with this product!! This is a 5 star product!!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="2-great-to-help-your-child-get-on-and-off-the">2) Great to help your child get on and off the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just tried it out yesterday with my child. There are some pros can cons with this product.Pros:1) Gives parents ease of mind that their child will not fly off the mountain and hit the cars in the parking lot.2) Great to help your child get on and off the ski lift3) Great to help pick your child when they fall because of the handle in the back.Cons:1) Since this tool hits the child in the upper torso, I can see how this could give the child incorrect form verses some other tools in the market.2) The long cord could get in the way.3) You can&rsquo;t carry your poles and use this trainer so the flat parts are a killer on your quads.Goal for this product: I just wanted a tool to keep my child safe while she learns how to get used to skiing (putting on and taking off the boots, etc). Once I feel she is comfortable at stopping and having self-control then I will stop using this and put her into lessons so she can have proper technique. Have fun skiing!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="must-have-for-the-starter-skier-and-parent">Must have for the starter skier and parent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this now on both of my sons and it&rsquo;s almost a must have when they are learning to Ski. I don&rsquo;t think you will be using this long enough to teach your kids bad habits. My older son used it the first season when he was 4, now that he is 8 he won Gold in down hill race of his ski class. I used the harness on my 3 year old this year and it worked great for me to teach him to keep his balance. I might use it a few times next season until he is on his own.READ MORE</p>
