<p>The Sony Region Free Blu-ray players are hands down the best players if you are interested in playing Blu-rays or DVDs from different zones or regions. Sony makes 4 models (BDP-S1200, BDP-S3200, BDP-S5200, and BDP-S6200) Please make sure you buy the Multi system version if you want region free functionality. It will say in the title of the listing.I&rsquo;m posting this same review on all 4 models since they are basically all the same unit with different features and I have had the opportunity to try all of them. First all these players are region free and will play blu-ray movies from any region including A, B, and C regions. Also standard DVDs from anywhere in the world play on these players.110-240 voltage allows for use anywhere in the world. Plus they are &ldquo;smart&rdquo; players which allow you to do Amazon prime and instant video. So if you&rsquo;re like me and have a Amazon prime account you can watch the videos directly on your tv. This is one of the hundreds of apps available on Sony players. I&rsquo;ve also tried using youtube, pandora, and netflix- all of them work good. Netflix is a bit slow to bootup but once it&rsquo;s done it works flawlessly. I personally have the BDP-S5200 and the BDP-S3200. They are practically all the same except for a few differences. The BDP-S1200 is the basic player and requires a hard wired internet connection if you want to connect to internet. The BDP-S3200 adds WiFi built into the player. Next is the BDP-S5200 which adds 3D support so it has WiFi and 3D. The last is the BDP-S6200. This is their highest level model which has Wifi, 3D plus it also if 4K. I personally own the BDP-S5200 and the BDP-S3200. I have also used the BDP-S6200 because a friend of mind has it connected to a 4K tv. These Sony players are excellent quality and work great. Buy the model that has the features you need. All 4 are readily available on Amazon. I hope this helps people make a good choice. I normally don&rsquo;t post reviews but when I bought this there were none available so I wanted to contribute this to others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hailing from the UK (I moved to the United States in 1999) I always missed some of my favorite British TV shows, and so I ended up accumulating quite a collection of DVDs from across the pond. When my old multi-region DVD player finally bit the dust, those discs gathered dust on the shelves for a number of years. Finally needing a new Blu Ray player, I decided to go the multi-region route, and after a bit of research, settled on this as my new player of choice.I was not disappointed! The player switches between zones at the push of a button when you power it on. It plays British and US DVDs and Blu-Rays without a hitch, and does so with excellent picture and sound quality (the only limitation is the 480 resolution of some of those old DVDs). The player connected to my home wireless network without a problem and streams Netflix and Amazon TV shows very nicely too. The unit is slim and compact. The only gripe I have (and it&rsquo;s a very minor one) is the size and layout of the remote control, which is on the tiny side and a little clunky to use. I have no hesitation in recommending either this player or the seller to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bought this to play 4K discs it only upscales HD discs and will NOT play 4k discs returned for refund and had to buy a Samsung because they were the only 4k disc player available at that time I&rsquo;m sure the Sony does a good job of upscaling Blu Ray HD but I did not buy it for that</p>

<p>i guess this is my fault for not reading the Q&amp;A&hellip;&hellip;but seriously&hellip;..for the price of this item and the fact that it plays every disc on the planet&hellip;..why wouldnt i assume that it actually PLAYED 4K discs&hellip;&hellip;ah well&hellip;..live and learn</p>

<h5 id="a-small-but-mighty-blu-ray">A Small but Mighty Blu-Ray</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Sony Blu-Ray player was a replacement for a much more expensive high-end brand player that developed a tendency to &ldquo;stutter&rdquo; during Blu-Ray playback. I have been a movie and classical music critic during my working years, and having a reliable and versatile player is a must. This player has been entirely satisfactory during the month I have had it. I have used it for CDs, Super Audio CDs, standard DVDs, DVD-Audio only, Blu-Ray, and Blu-Ray Audio discs, and all work immediately and transparently. The only function I haven&rsquo;t tested is the manufactyurer-state ability to play DVDs from outside the stated region. (I don&rsquo;t expect it will be able to play discs in the non-NTSC video standards that are used in much of the Eastern Hemisphere, such as PAL.)The sound is clean, accurate, and full-ranged, worthy of the mid-to-high-end 7-chanel system we have. The picture is equally good. The up-converting of standard definition video discs&rsquo; output to a picture approaching HD is excellent, superior to the high-end device the Sony replaced. My wife, who rarely takes notice of technical issues, immediately praised the improved picture and sound.The compact design of the player is noteworthy. Actually, being next to some bigger components it looks likes like a bit of a wimp. But this is the wrong impression, in addition to being trivial. In everything that counts, this player delivers. I imagine most customers would appreciate that this device is no space hog.I think the layout of the rather small remote control is just a little less ergonomic than the previous one. But, again, consumers who feel they are drowning in big, clunky remotes will likely appreciate this feature as well.It came well-packaged. The instruction booklet is clear and useful. Delivery was on time, and Bombay has followed up in a considerate manner, by which I man that hey are not hitting me over the head with post-marketing ads and such.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i am speechless&hellip;.look at the pics , WHAT did i exactly get ? &hellip; I was hoping to get a DECENT REFURB of this model but i wasn&rsquo;t sure IF QC or the CARRIER had a field day on this one&hellip;i did not even power this unit and i RETURNED it as soon as I opened it.. Tell you what, based on the number of FAV reviews this one may have slipped the cracks so i&rsquo;m giving them the BENEFIT of the DOUBT (just this once! ) since this was not brand new and will try another unit since i really NEED one for my UK DVDs so expect the another review next week&hellip;</p>
