<blockquote>
<p>Â This dash cam works and looks really good. The first thing I did once I received it I downloaded the firmware update from the provided link and copied the file (extracted from zip file first) to the SD card, put it in the camera, and turned it on and viola the firmware upgrade was quickly done. Here is my thoughts on the camera:QUALITY:- Built:The camera itself is a very sturdy and I accidentally dropped it before installing it and I thought something is going to stop working. So I did a lot of testing and I was please to find out that nothing happened to the internal hardware and it was as good as the new one even though the drop was a bad one. This is great in my book as not a days with all the cheap products on the market you really can&rsquo;t expect a lot of products to survive a drop (even sometimes the expensive ones such as your galaxy s6 Edge or iPhone 7).- Video:after the firmware upgrade I was able to record in 1080P (1440x1080) @ 30FPS and 1080FHD (1920x1080) @ 30FPS in addition to all the lower resolutions. The file format is .avi. The video quality is good. I have to note that it is not GoPro quality but for dash cam is pretty good. The camera records good in the dark environments as it has a good auto light adjustment, even if that is not enough you can always bump up or down the exposure manually in the settings. I attached a sample footage.-Picture:the picture quality is good. I only tested it at max resolution which is 12M (4032x3024). The file format is .jpg. I attached a sample picture.Auto ON/OFF:The dash cam turns on by itself when you start the car by turning on the engine and it turns off shortly after you turn of the engine.Motion Detection:You can set it to motion detection and the camera can record if there is any movement in front of it and stops when there is not more movement on front of it. This way you save storage. If you enable the parking mode is also enabled and you car doesn&rsquo;t cut electricity when then engine is off and the motion detection is on you can also have it record if someone bump into your car when it is parked. But if the car stops the electricity then it can record until it runs out of battery.WDR:When this option is one the field of view gets a bit wider which is good since you can record more of the scene. But if you prefer narrower field of view to get a closer view of the license plate of the car directly in front of your car you can leave it off. I left it on as wanted more inclusiveLoop Recording:This feature is common in dash cams and it&rsquo;s there for the time that you run out of storage, it records over the older files but not the files that are locked. You can either lock the file your self by pressing the middle button or if the gyroscope is one when you get into accident and and the camera sense a sudden impact it will lock the file itself. In the menu you can individually or select all lock files and unlock them before being able to delete them individually or all at one time. Depending on the quality that you set (which dictates the size of the file) and the size of the micro SD card you inserted in the dash cam you can pick the appropriate loop size. Usually the smaller the card and the higher the quality the auto save file duration should be shorter so in case you run out of storage the files get over written are shorter.APP &amp; WIFI:This is where the camera really shines. By pressing the middle button for 3 second the camera goes to WIFI mode and once you connect your phone to the dash cam WIFI you can view what the camera is seeing (but in lower quality for smooth transmission) and recording live in the app. There you have access to all the settings and you can change them as you wish. You can take pictures and video just by pressing record in (video or picture mode). More importantly, you can view and download all the recorded pictures and videos via the app to you phone through the WIFI. You still can take out the SD card and view the files on computer or just view them on the dash cam itself. I went over the settings in my video as well.Overall, it&rsquo;s a very good camera. I didn&rsquo;t install the tail end of it as it was just to cover the cable specially if you are placing it somewhere bellow the rear view mirror. In the video I quickly went over the settings &amp; playback menu, and live view. Also attached an actual footage of the camera that was recorded to the SD to the end of the video.</p>

<h5 id="best-value-for-first-wi-fi-dash-cam">Best Value for First Wi-Fi Dash Cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I selected this model because of the wi-fi . The F5 is currently the lowest cost Wi-fi dash cam available. I like the fact that with a little portable power supply,or household AC, you have a mobile streaming wifi cam you can access with your iPad , tablet or phone. After trying it out for a week, I bought two more as gifts.The free app makes watching and saving videos easy, as well as doing all the cam adjustments .The 720 video quality is surprisingly good in different lighting conditions. If you demand the highest video quality, you&rsquo;ll have to spend more money to get it.This little power house is a great value if wi-fi and price are importent to you. I didn&rsquo;t get anything for free to write this review. If it helped you, please click, thanks.</p>

<h5 id="nice-dash-cam-for-a-little-price">Nice dash cam for a little price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I really like this dash cam. It is not perfect, but for the money it does everything I could want.Pros:1) Nice videos, not 1080 but nice. (see video upload)2) I like the way it mounts with 2 way tape (not everyone will), it is stable and easy to take on and off the windshield. (the tape and mount stays)3) Small and unobtrusive.4) Has crash protection, meaning if it detects a crash it saves the last video.5) It records in 3 minute segments (can be set to 1,2, or 3 minute segments) so a 16g sd card like I have can record many segments before any are rewritten. (I have 47 3 minute segments on the camera already and still have room) Btw, does not come with sd card.6) Plenty of cord to run and has a compartment to hide any excess.7) There is a setting to make the videos lighter or darker depending on taste or for night or day. I use a higher bright setting because the night videos were a little dark. Still playing with this setting, but if you use the highest night setting the night videos are pretty good. I don&rsquo;t use it because I am afraid it will wash out the day videos. Still playing.Cons1) Could have a better manual, but it is sufficient.By the way the video was formatted in AVI dv in order to upload. The actual video looks a little better.</p>

<p>Firstly, when you get it, you have to upgrade its firmware to get 1080p recording from a camera advertised as 1080p. That&rsquo;s extremely tacky.</p>
