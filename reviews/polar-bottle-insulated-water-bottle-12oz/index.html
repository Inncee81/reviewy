<h5 id="fun-to-use-great-for-kids">Fun to Use, Great for Kids</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids take these fun bottles to school and I know they&rsquo;re drinking more water.I&rsquo;m never sure if the kids bother to get a beverage (or drink all of it) when they have lunch at school, but with these 12oz Polar water bottles, I know they&rsquo;re drinking their water. The bottles go to school filled with water and come home filled with air.The loops make the bottles easy to grab and carry. The colorful inserts make the bottles easy to identify.The only leaking problems I&rsquo;ve experienced are when the kids have refilled their own bottles and not screwed the caps on straight and when the leave the black drinking valve open. When the valve is open, the water flows. There&rsquo;s no lock or biting/sucking mechanism to get the water our. Just pour and it flows. This is fine as long as the kids know to close the valve after drinking and never, ever, ever, put the bottle <em>inside</em> their backpacks.I love these little polar bottles and I&rsquo;m thinking of getting one for myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="daughter-loves-the-bottle-and-i-love-she-s-drinking-more-water">Daughter loves the bottle, and I love she&rsquo;s drinking more water</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this water bottle for my daughter, because she hates warm water (as do I). I fill it up about halfway and stick it in the freezer overnight, and when I pack her snack, I take it out and top it with water. She has cold water to last the school day, and she&rsquo;s drinking more fluids. Plus, she loves the purple color which is even more incentive for an 8-yr-old.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="drink-more-water">Drink More Water</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids had a habit of losing their new water bottles about a week into school. Tired of wasting money, I quit buying them and sent them to the water fountain. Now that they&rsquo;re a little older, I&rsquo;m trying again with the Polar Bottles.These 12-ounce bottles are the perfect size to slip into the side pocket of their backpacks. They can slide out when the packs are carelessly tossed in the trunk of the car, but for the most part they stay put.The looped handle makes it easy to pull the bottle from the pocket and fun to carry.If you don&rsquo;t get the cap screwed on just right, a little water can leak from the side. (This is only a problem when the kids refill at school.)If you don&rsquo;t push the black valve all the way down, the water will leak out through the valve. (Figured this out while washing the lids, and made sure the kids knew that bottles go in pockets, not the bottom of the backpack.The kids love the fun patterns. (Pink Leopard is awesome!) We&rsquo;re over a week into school and the bottles are still coming home. I especially love that they go to school full and come home empty.</p>

<h5 id="good-bottle-a-bit-bulky-but-no-sweating-and-no-leaking">good bottle, a bit bulky but no &ldquo;sweating&rdquo; and no leaking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a small water bottle that I could throw in my purse and take with me- therefore, I hoped to find something that would be insulated (no condensation on the outside of the bottle), would not leak when shut, and would keep cool throughout the day, so I went ahead and ordered this one. The price seemed fair- especially when compared to other bottles- and the small size, wide lid (ice is a must!), and spout that would seal and stay closed appealed to me.The bottle is great except for one tiny thing- it&rsquo;s bulky. Of course, it sort of has to be, in order to stay insulated, but it&rsquo;s still sort of a chunky little water bottle that looks a lot like a sippy cup. It&rsquo;s not exactly something I can just slip into my purse, I have to make room for it.Oh, and the spout makes that &ldquo;whistly&rdquo; noise when you drink from it. I&rsquo;m not sure if EVERY bottle does that, but if you&rsquo;re looking to bring this into meetings or some atmosphere (library? classroom?) be aware that it&rsquo;s quite noisy to drink from.Regardless, it&rsquo;s a good bottle and it keeps water cool and safely inside. Recommended!</p>

<h5 id="used-every-other-day-for-2-years-no-leaks">Used every other day for 2 years, no leaks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter must drink medicine every day, mixed into a drink. We purchased two of these bottles almost two years ago and ALONE among the myriad of water bottles we have bought, these are still going strong. Keep in mind, she uses her bottles every day and we bought them two years ago, so they have been used 365 times a piece with no breaks, and STILL no leaks. They keep water cooler than a plain bottle. I&rsquo;ve never had another thermos or water bottle last six months, so two years is incredible. We finally misplaced one, so we&rsquo;re getting another. Yes, it is true the design is on an internal flexible liner, so the design is &ldquo;wrinkled&rdquo; but it looks cool, that is part of the look of the bottle. And it doesn&rsquo;t leak, so honestly I don&rsquo;t care what it looks like. We hand wash them, we don&rsquo;t put them in the dishwasher.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-functions-well-but-not-designed-very-well-to-accommodate-the-picture">It functions well but not designed very well to accommodate the picture.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While this bottle keeps my daughter&rsquo;s water cold for the day, she doesn&rsquo;t love it because the foil (with the fairy picture, the most important part of this to my daughter!!) between the layers looks like it was crammed in. It&rsquo;s all wrinkly and doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. I can&rsquo;t seem to take it out without destroying the bottle, so it is staying in. Not a good design at all. I bought two, and it&rsquo;s the same for both. I won&rsquo;t go through the trouble of returning them, especially since it functions reasonably well, but I won&rsquo;t plan to buy another. I will be looking for another brand.</p>

<h5 id="green-fade-polar-bottle-insulated-water-bottle">Green Fade Polar Bottle Insulated Water Bottle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a smaller water bottle for my bike. I have a men&rsquo;s small frame bike so the space is limited. This water bottle fits perfectly in the space. Smaller water bottle though means less water. I ride to my he local Y and will refill it before I ride back home. Luckily some of the ice I stuff in at the start will still be ice so the water will continue to be colder than just from a tap. I also found that I like the loop attached to it. Plus the bottle doesn&rsquo;t perspire. I will likely buy another one to store in the handle bar back and to have an extra one handy.</p>

<h5 id="in-addition-the-wrap-is-not-nicely-attached-to-the-bottle">In addition the wrap is not nicely attached to the bottle</h5>
