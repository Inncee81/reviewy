<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-baseball-bag">Great Baseball Bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read the reviews for this before I bought it. We have had no zipper issues. My son, who is 9, and a bit rough, takes this to ball at least 3 times per week. It gets slung around, participates in impromptu tug of war, gets stepped on in dugout, and generally gets treated fairly rough. I have seen no damage to it at all. No complaints from the boy. It fits his helmet in the &ldquo;ball pouch&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t know if it would fit if he had a face mask on his helmet. Even if this one gets damaged or ruined, I will buy another. It has all the right compartments.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-bag-baseball-helmet-fits-perfectly-inside-the-bottom">Great bag! Baseball helmet fits perfectly inside the bottom &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bag! Baseball helmet fits perfectly inside the bottom and we can fit his baseball clothes, glove, batting glove, baseball and cleats inside the bag with room to spare. Love the bag. Great product and price.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bag">Bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bag arrived in two days and I used Standard Shipping so possibly was shipped from somewhere close. Fits my son&rsquo;s soccer ball and will hold his uniforms when we travel. Quality of the bag is ok. He has not started using it but hopefully it will last at least one soccer season.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-bag-we-received-was-a-completely-different-bag">The bag we received was a completely different bag. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bag we received was a completely different bag. It didn&rsquo;t have a zipper pouch - rather bungie that were held to the sides with cheap tabs. There was a bat holder but it, in no way, could hold a real bat. Might work for toy bats. No pen holder on the front either. The product didn&rsquo;t match the picture at all.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-price-couple-small-issues">Great for price&hellip;couple small issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great price for the amount of space and versatility of the backpack. Quality seems ok although I am waiting for that basketball access zipper to fail anytime because it does seem weak. And the other con I have with the backpack is the silly sized cell phone holder. I have the smaller regular iPhone 6s and it doesn&rsquo;t even almost fit&hellip;so I imagine most modern cell phones won&rsquo;t fit.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="surprised">Surprised!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the money, you can&rsquo;t beat this product. We had been looking for a backpack style equipment bag for basketball. Seen several teammates using the expensive name brands and they struggle to fit all their items and their ball. I see them have to empty their bag to get their ball out. Not with this bag! Great separate pocket for the bball, plenty of space for shoes and knee pads plus side pockets and mesh pouches. All for this low price! The other pleasant surprise was the durable material. Very tough, thick material. Awesome product for the $$.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="very-good">very good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We used for only half a season, but no issues. Held my sons equipment well with some room to spare.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="very-disappointed-because-while-we-were-able-to-use-it-my">Very disappointed because while we were able to use it my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this bag less than a month ago and one of the straps already broke. Very disappointed because while we were able to use it my son absolutely loved it. And we need to put too much in the bag to weigh it down, we only carried 1 pair of shoes and a basketball.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sports-bag">Great sports bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great roomy bag with lots of pockets. Only draw back is that it does NOT have a hook to hang it on the fence in the dug out for baseball.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="durability-issues">Durability Issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern,I was a big fan of your bag when I received it from amazon. However, in barely over a month, the shoulder strap is broken - I’ve only put a laptop and&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Best backpack ever! After putting a pair of shoes and a ball in the bag. It doesn&rsquo;t feel bulky!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too small, and can hardly fit anyyhing else in it, after the basketball!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-size-bag">Good size bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good size bag. Better fit for an adult than a 6yo who is pretty tall for his age already.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-bag-for-the-price">Good bag for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good bag for the price. I work in construction and use this bag when when I work in the city and take mass transit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves is baseball back pack, now he as all his baseball gear in one place. I was amazed at the price of this back pack, overall I am very happy with my purchase.</p>
