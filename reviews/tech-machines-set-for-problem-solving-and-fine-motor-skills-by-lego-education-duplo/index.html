<p>The LEGO Education 745002 95-piece DUPLO tech machines set includes the components required to assemble four construction vehicles, a crane, and a wind turbine as well as other construction-scene accessories and figures to help students learn about machines and their functions. Integrated screws on the blocks click into place with the included screwdrivers, providing hands-on experience with tools and assembly. The set comes with an activity pack that includes building-inspiration cards and a list of problem-solving tasks. DUPLO blocks are twice as large as standard LEGO bricks to better accommodate preschool-age children. The set supports a group of four students, ages three years and older, and comes in a plastic storage container with a transparent lid.</p>

<p>Science education products incorporate applied math and science principles into classroom projects. Teachers in pre-K, elementary, and secondary classrooms use science education kits and products alongside science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curriculum to demonstrate STEM concepts and real-world applications through hands-on activities. Science education projects include a broad range of activities, such as practical experiments in engineering, aeronautics, robotics, energy, chemistry, physics, biology, and geology.</p>

<p>LEGO Education manufactures hands-on, curriculum-based products to teach students from pre-school through university. LEGO Education was founded in 1980 in Denmark; LEGO Education North America, founded in 1997, is headquartered in Pittsburg, KS.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="sons-love-it">Sons love it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I hesitated ordering it based upon the price but with the other great reviews and knowing how much my boys love Legos and tools, I took a chance. My sons, age 5 and 6, just love this set!! They just played with it for the first time today for the 5 y/oâ€™s birthday. The pieces are so sturdy, and since they screw together they can actually play with them without them falling apart (as opposed to traditional Lego bricks) There are only specific instructions for 2 machines, but it is fun to watch the kids stare at the pictures to figure out how the other machines were made and figure it out for themselves.Both boys declared at bedtime tonight that this would be the first thing they played with tomorrow.Very pricey, but I think they will play with this for a long time and this will be definitely be a keeper for the grandchildren some day. The quality is phenomenal.</p>

<h5 id="and-she-loved-it-she-has-a-tool-box-so-she">and she loved it. She has a tool box so she &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter will turn 2 in January, and she loved it. She has a tool box so she was a bit familiar with the screwdriver. We hope this is a toy that will grow with her age, as there is so much she can do. In my opinion it is expensive if you plan on buying toys for every age gap. It is safe for young kids. The only item I plan of taking away from her is the shovel. Will make an instructional video so she can assemble it as I think is way to difficult for her at the moment. For older kids it is a question of using logic on the assemble process.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="educational-and-fun">Educational and fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 4 year old son and I built all the machines together and I was so impressed by his ability to handle the screwdriver, pick out the pieces needed to build each vehicle, and put them together. I had fun as well! This set it so cool and truly educational. He&rsquo;s been playing with it nonstop since it arrive. This is second only to the Lego Education Simple Machines set, which has gears that turn to create engines. Lego Education is amazing and hard to find in stores. Way better than the Disney princess castles and cars sets.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-you-imagine-dough-worthy">better than you imagine. dough worthy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This could be the coolest toy I&rsquo;ve ever seen for young&rsquo;ns. The screw drivers click at torque, the pieces stay together until taken apart. Crane, excavator, front loader. Plenty of figures. And it&rsquo;s duplo. This may be the only set to survive the transition to reg legos. I&rsquo;m geeking hard right now.Do in inventory on delivery. Mine was missing a few pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-curious-kids">Great for curious kids</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set has been our most popular to date. I bought it for my oldest son for his 4th birthday. That was 3.5 years ago and it&rsquo;s still getting used. My other two sons have both loved the set also. We had an issue with the first set we got. Even though the wheels were fully tightened with the screwdriver, as soon as the boys would push them across the floor, the wheels would unscrew and fall out. It became incredibly frustrating for such young kids but luckily Amazon were amazing and replaced the entire set for us. I&rsquo;m not even sure it&rsquo;s worth taking a star off because the issue we had was handled so well but I would like people to be aware it can happen but also that it can be remedied very easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-really-love-this-set">We really love this set. :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this one as my son&rsquo;s 2-year-old birthday gift.We&rsquo;ve been looking for a great excavator/crane for a long long time, and this set completed my son&rsquo;s engineering truck set perfectly.The excavator is really great. It can turn 360 degrees just like a real excavator, and the bucket and booms could work together like a real excavator too.The front loader and the crane are also elegant.The dump truck is a little better than another duplo dump truck.And there are construction crew too so every machine could be controlled by a worker, which is a big plus.The cement mixer is a little cheesy, and the wind turbine is not impressive either, but we think others are awesome.We assembled all the trucks for him since he&rsquo;s too young, but he&rsquo;s already showing interest assembling/dissembling all the parts. I can&rsquo;t wait to see he builds his own truck. ^^Overall, I&rsquo;m super happy with it. :) The price is kind of high but I feel it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-potential-for-creativity-and-really-well-made-great-lego-customer-service-too">Great potential for creativity and really well made. Great Lego customer service, too.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our son loves figuring out how to assemble the vehicles and then playing with them. There are many different ways to build the vehicles so it promotes creative thought. But essentially you can&rsquo;t go wrong with boys and construction toys. Another big plus is the quality as these pieces seem significantly better than the typical Lego sets, so they should be durable over the years. Finally, excellent Amazon &amp; Lego customer support. The product shipped with one incorrect part a fire hose instead of a construction hook for the crane. Amazon shipped out a second set within 24 hours and have us an RA for our set. However, the replacement set also ha the same incorrect part, so then we contacted Lego and they shipped the exact part free of all charges within a week!</p>

<h5 id="legos">Legos</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these for my grandson for Christmas and he was so excited he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy I think my heart is going to burst&rdquo;. He loves them and they come in a plastic container to keep them in when not using them. I recommend them for kids who love legos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="he-hasn-t-really-explored-free-form-building-with-this-set-and-i-feel-like-that-might-be-a-little-limited">He hasn&rsquo;t really explored free form building with this set and I feel like that might be a little limited</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2 (almost 3) year old loves this toy and after a couple of weeks of building together he now can build the machines by himself for the most part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2 little boys like this so much!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product">nice product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this one is interesting, baby like to use screw driver do somethingI think the blocks in this product are more tight than other lego products, that is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hand-down-this-is-the-best-duplo-set-ever">Hand DOWN this is the BEST DUPLO set EVER</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hand DOWN this is the BEST DUPLO set EVER!!! My son is OBSESSED with the Caterpillar tracks. There isn&rsquo;t a build set-by-step guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="our-boys-currently-2-and-3-1-2-love-this-set">Our boys (currently 2 and 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>) love this set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We got this set from grandma for Christmas. Our boys (currently 2 and 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>) love this set. 9 months later they haven&rsquo;t broken any of the pieces and they still spend hours playing&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-4-and-half-year-old-was-through-this-in">My 4 and half year old was through this in &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 4 and half year old was through this in an hour - it&rsquo; was just a little too simple for him. Perhaps it&rsquo;s OK for smaller kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-for-2-1-2-year-old">Fun for 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> year-old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit is great. My 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> year-old daughter loves this. I spent the first few hours playing with it together so she could see how to use the screwdriver to attach wheels and&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-lego-set-ever">Best Lego Set Ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great set for a 5 year old. He has been constantly working with it and loves to play with the toys once they are built.</p>
