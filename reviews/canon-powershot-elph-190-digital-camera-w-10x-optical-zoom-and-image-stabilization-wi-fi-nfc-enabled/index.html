<p>10x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer helps you capture images with flexibility and ease</p>

<p>10x Optical Zoom
The PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera features a 10x Optical Zoom so spectacular shots are within your reach. You&rsquo;ll love the flexibility it gives you when shooting with an amazing range of 24–240mm (35mm equivalent) in a slim, stylish compact camera. Plus, the wide-angle lens captures an expansive image in each shot, adding depth, perspective and grandeur. Landscapes, city scenes, family shots and more benefit from the extra width. Whether you&rsquo;re shooting wide group shots or zooming to the telephoto end, your images can be bright and clear.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with select PowerShot cameras, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because these cameras are equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the ideal shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the Image Stabilizer is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Built-in Wi-Fi and NFC allows for easy sharing and transferring of images and videos</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi Technology Makes Sharing Quick and Easy

<p>20.0 Megapixel* CCD sensor combines with the DIGIC 4+ Image Processor to help deliver stunning image quality
20.0 Megapixel* Sensor
Preserve special moments from weddings to vacations in stunning quality with the PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera. The camera is equipped with a 20.0 Megapixel* sensor to help create images that are incredibly clear and beautifully detailed. The high level of resolution gives you the flexibility to be more creative with your shots: crop and enlarge any part of an image – you can be confident that the detail and resolution you need are there, even when you want to print and frame your photos.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera&rsquo;s DIGIC 4+ Image Processor features accelerated processing speed to create fast, responsive performance, giving you a shooting experience that&rsquo;s easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by up to 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This help significantly reduce noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system can compensate for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The result is images that are reliably sharp and clear at all lengths of the camera&rsquo;s powerful 10x Optical Zoom. The processor&rsquo;s highly efficient design also extends battery life.</p>

<p>Capture 720p HD video
Using the slim PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera, you can shoot high-definition video when you want, where you want. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you&rsquo;ll be able to quickly record moments in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories.</p>

<p>Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings based on predefined shooting situations
Getting that great shot can be as simple as pressing the shutter button on the PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera with Smart AUTO, which automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. On the PowerShot ELPH 190 IS, detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations.</p>

<p>The camera then makes optimal settings to help facilitate incredible image capture, whether you&rsquo;re shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<p>Scene Modes such as Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect and Monochrome provide creative freedom to capture your photos
The PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera provides shooting modes that can easily give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters. You can make a quirky portrait using the Fisheye Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as if capturing the photo using a “toy” or pinhole camera.</p>

<p>Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.
Portrait    Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background.
Face Self-timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter.
Low Light   For high-quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Fisheye Effect  Now you can get the fisheye effect – a classic photographic distortion – without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect    Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with “toy” or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Fireworks   Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.
Movie   Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.
Actual results may vary from examples shown above.
Final image may vary depending on picture composition.</p>

<p>ECO Mode helps reduce power consumption for longer battery life
The PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera features ECO Mode to help provide a high number of shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. The mode can be activated via a dedicated button for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won&rsquo;t miss the moment.</p>

<p>Help Button provides simple explanations and easy control of your settings
The PowerShot ELPH 190 IS camera is designed to be fun and easy to use, even for beginners. A Help Button on the camera&rsquo;s exterior brings up the help menu when you need it, right on the LCD screen. From here, you can scroll through a variety of topics that answer your questions with clear explanations, offer helpful shooting advice and show you diagrams highlighting the position of any buttons you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like this camera very much. It has a few issues with zoom focusing but it is very nice overall, especially for under $200. The photos taken were without flash (museum), from 20 about feet away. Good detail on most of the photos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera-for-the-price">Great camera for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, this is an amazing camera. It does exactly what it states and I haven&rsquo;t had any problems on it. I took over 600 photos and videos over multiple days and my battery didn&rsquo;t die. I would recommend this to a freind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought for a two week vacation. took around 1800 photos. For the most part, all the pix are great. the refresh cycle is pretty fast. it slows as the battery drains. but I got five days or 500 pictures per charge. I have not set up any of the wifi features so I can not comment on that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just returned from trip and the pictures are great. Even low light scenes and pictures from a moving bus turned out great. In fact I didn&rsquo;t use the flash option on low light and they turned out better, only used flash for night time scenes. Battery lasted the whole 10 day trip took over 140 pictures.</p>

<h5 id="complicated-process-to-access-photos">Complicated Process To Access Photos</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not have a cable to direct download pics to computer. If I had realized this I would not have purchased this camera. I bought 2 of them and the wifi setup is complicated and doesn&rsquo;t work correctly. Took me several frustrating hours to get the pictures off both cameras into my online photo software.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no pro but I haven&rsquo;t noticed any difference between the photos I take with this camera vs. my iphone. It&rsquo;s small enough so you can take it anywhere in your pocket. I wish it had a viewfinder because the screen you look at when you take the photo is quite small, much smaller than my phone.</p>
