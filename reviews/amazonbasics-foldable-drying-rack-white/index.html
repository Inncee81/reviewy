<h5 id="rods-bent-and-fell-apart-after-1-year">Rods Bent and Fell Apart After 1 Year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband bought this on his Amazon account, so it was a Verified Purchase. At first, I loved this rack, it folded opened so easily and snapped together quickly. It stored flat enough to fit neatly in the gap beside our washer. I would&rsquo;ve given this thing 5 stars if it lasted.Over the course of 1 year, we&rsquo;ve draped various things on this rack such as a small wool blanket, a winter coat with gloves, bath mats and light &ldquo;air dry only&rdquo; shirts (not all at the same time). The heaviest pieces were always draped across the top portion, never on individual bars on the sides. Yet all three aluminum rods on one side of the rack have become bent over time, especially the bottom bar which we&rsquo;ve never hung anything on. In the photo you can see how bent the bottom rod is, while the top rod has popped out of its socket. I&rsquo;ve tried popping the top rod back in while the middle and bottom rod popped out, and as I tried to get those in, the ones I just popped in would pop out like some kind of comedy routine. So this is going to end up on the curb while I search for a rack that actually functions for more than a year.My advice is to get a sturdier rack if you plan on using it for drying wet things like winter coats, clothing, blankets or bathroom mats.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-product-great-price">Great product, great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Vine Voice (though would love to be considering how detailed my reviews are) but reviews are what online buying is all about and I rely on them heavily, so contribute back. This rack was just delivered and I already have it set up and in use. I can tell it&rsquo;s going to be outstanding. I&rsquo;ll revise this if I&rsquo;m wrong but hands down, best one I&rsquo;ve seen from ALL aspects, as follows: Coated metal is much like curtain rods&ndash;baked on, not just painted. Nothing to snag delicate fabrics on (Yay!). Joints are all sturdy-fit and smooth moving. Unit locks into place with swing-top&rsquo;s notch-down and notches are GOOD ones with secure snap-in. Easy fold-out/collapse and it definitely stands independently when collapsed (another peeve solved). I&rsquo;m very surprised at the quality for the price frankly. It&rsquo;s quite tall so things on hangers will not drag on the floor and given its height, it&rsquo;s as stable as it possibly could be, and much more so than shorter ones I&rsquo;ve seen. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier! I air-dry long sleeve shirts (can be draped across) as well as unspun fiber/roving that I hand dye plus skeined yarns. This little sweetheart is everything I hoped for and more than I dared beyond that. I had never heard of &ldquo;Amazon Basics&rdquo; and just stumbled across this (it was not featured in my search) but if this is an example of a brand being created, then I sure like where they&rsquo;re going. Top quality, this, and I&rsquo;ve seen others for a lot higher price tag that simply don&rsquo;t compare. at all! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been wanting one for so long. Ohhh so glad I saw this.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-cheap-piece-of-junk-sadly">DON&rsquo;T BUY: CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK SADLY!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am SO DISAPPOINTED and SHOCKED by this laundry rack! Every other AmazonBasics product I own (cables, kitchen mat, batteries etc) is very high quality and totally what I wanted/needed, so I thought this rack was a no-brainer: less expensive than other racks and a brand that I know and trust. Well, I THOUGHT that until I got this piece of junk. I guess this item was in high demand because I originally ordered it Aug 8, 2015 and it took until Oct 20, 2015 to arrive &ndash; they kept sending me emails saying they were backordered. I waited patiently because I really needed a second laundry rack and had a bad experience with another brand that I returned. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know what happened in production, but here are specific problems with this AmazonBasics laundry rack:1. The construction is terrible. The screws that hold it together are totally stripped (see uploaded images, you can tell that they&rsquo;re stripped by the fact that where you insert your screwdriver is practically circular, not a &ldquo;cross&rdquo; shape) and so have jagged and sharp metal sticking out! That not only means you have to be careful where you put your hands when picking it up or moving it, but I suspected it would snag clothing and even damage it. So I took a kitchen towel and gently ran it over the sides of this rack and yep &ndash; the towel caught on the jagged screws and fuzz came off! Imagine what it would do to delicate clothing that you care about!2. The curvy pieces that go over the top bar to hold the rack upright were really sharp, cheap plastic &ndash; so much so that after ONE USE the coating on the top bar had already come off! See the image I uploaded &ndash; that&rsquo;s after ONE USE! My old rack that I threw away awhile ago had a cheap coating on the bars that started coming off and getting all over my clothes. I never want that to happen again. But obviously the black coating will just continue to peel off because the adapter piece is such terrible quality. I didn&rsquo;t test this but I worried that if I caught my finger in that piece just the wrong way (like when unfurling it or something) I could cut myself.3. It doesn&rsquo;t unfold easily. I had to hold the bottom part, hold the top part and pull them apart. My other laundry rack unfolds if I just put it on the floor, grab the top rung and lift. Thats a one-handed job. Not so for this one.Maybe I got a dud &ndash; a byproduct of them ramping up production to meet demand or something. But I&rsquo;ve loved all of my AmazonBasics products until now, and my faith in that brand is definitely dented now. So it pains me honestly to write such a bad review. Please, Amazon &ndash; your Basics line of products has been AWESOME until now, don&rsquo;t ruin a good thing. Easy, inexpensive, reliable goods of high quality are desperately needed. Sadly this laundry rack seems like all the other cheap garbage we can buy in any big-box store around the country. Right the ship please, lest your brand sinks! I&rsquo;m going to have to think twice from now on before I buy AmazonBasics stuff, and that&rsquo;s a real shame.I needed a new laundry rack because our laundry needs have increased recently. I originally bought a second bamboo one, but theREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-was-the-perfect-solution-it-s-not-the-most-sturdy-thing-i-ve">This was the perfect solution. It&rsquo;s not the most sturdy thing I&rsquo;ve &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For some reason I always buy clothes that require being laid out to dry, and as such, the small space in my laundry room fills up fast. This was the perfect solution. It&rsquo;s not the most sturdy thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but so long as you don&rsquo;t run headlong into it, it will hold under the weight of wet/damp clothes.While I don&rsquo;t know that I would rush out to purchase it again, should it break, it&rsquo;s fitting the bill for right now and I can say I&rsquo;m pleased.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-drying-rack">This is a GREAT drying rack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a GREAT drying rack! I had purchased 2 at a local store that seemed like they were wonderful quality. However, after having them less than a year, both had a bracket break off at the top that rendered it unusable. This rack comes in the box, wrapped in plastic, and fully assembled. You just pull it out of the box, tear off the plastic, and unfold it to use it for the first time! I like that it is metal and sturdy, even when I have clothes hanging all over it. I&rsquo;m planning to purchase a 2nd one!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised.</h5>

<p>Purchased mostly to hang throw rugs on to dry rather than using dryer. This little rack can hold quite a load. Folds pretty flat and is very light weight. Very pleased.</p>

<h5 id="not-bad-at-all-for-the-money">Not bad at all for the money</h5>

<p>Not bad at all for the money. Most important it is more sturdy than the average racks I have owned before. Still not perfect though, it is a bit wobbly.</p>
