<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="worked-out-well-with-anticipated-modification">Worked out well with anticipated modification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mount worked out quite well. I knew that it would drop a little more than I wanted, so I was prepared for it. Cutting both pipes with a sawzall reduced the drop length and allowed me to install my 50&rdquo; LED TV under the cabinets of my fifth wheel. That said, the fifth wheel is at a permanent campsite. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend keeping a TV attached if you&rsquo;re dragging your camper around. I paid full price for this and did NOT receive a discount.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far&hellip;So good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t got this hung yet, but already wanted to leave a little feedback for those like me who might doubt a $50 ceiling mounted tv mount. So far so good. Very happy here! The product is rock solid sturdy. As expected after reading other reviews before I bought this, I planned on some modifications. This is going to be mounted on our covered deck, but will not be able to be up all the time, due to weather. I wanted a quick disconnect system, so the empty mount isn&rsquo;t hanging off the deck ceiling when the tv is put up in the garage. I drilled out the holes in the top bracket to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo;, and am using 2 cotterless hitch pins to hang the vertical arm and tv bracket. When the tv is put away, the only thing left outside is the 3&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; bracket lag bolted to the ceiling. Also the bracket is poorly designed in the fact that with any wind, the tv would spin as there was no lock to keep the arm from rotating in the bracket. To fix this, I drilled a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; hole in top corner and used a bolt with a washer to pinch the lip of the spinning pole tight so it now requires some force to rotate the tv. I will add more review later, but as of now, with about 20 minutes of modification, I have exactly what I was looking for!!</p>

<h5 id="great-with-minor-issues">Great, with minor issues..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has worked out great for my patio, the only issue I have with it is when the wind blows it sways a little bit. I have tried to find a way to secure it more, but haven&rsquo;t been successful. Otherwise it does great. One note is the arms will not fit a LG 42 LCD TV (like 2007 model) the ones provided with the kit are to short, luckily i had some extras from another mount that fit. That was the only other complaint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-mount-but-top-is-not-secured-at-all">Nice mount but top is not secured at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount looks nice but the top of the pole where it seats into the mount is a very loose fit by design. The down pole just hangs by gravity on a flange in the hole of the mount. I had it professionally installed and I thought they had made a mistake. But it looks like this is how it&rsquo;s designed. It makes it easy to swivel which is nice, but the pole hangs at an angle due to the offset weight of the TV. I&rsquo;m using it outside on a covered screened porch and I&rsquo;m afraid if there&rsquo;s any wind the TV will move around. I thought the pole would have been firmly held in place. I have it drilled into a cypress wood ceiling which cannot be easily repaired so I&rsquo;m leaving the mount in place. It&rsquo;s functioning ok for now just wasn&rsquo;t what I expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mount">Great Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great mount and very versatile. A lot of adjustments can be made. Instructions are not clear nor very good and need revision to indicate important tightening and adjustment options. Many previous reviews indicate post revolves 360 degrees and sways in wind or hangs to one side without able to adjust. All this can be tightened and adjusted to get this corrected. Best way is to tighten bolts and screws to take slack out and then adjust from there. NOTE: there are 4 screws were post meets mounting bracket, these need to be tightened and adjusted to keep from swaying. DO NOT overtighten!!</p>

<h5 id="quality-mount-yes-quality-company-tbd">Quality Mount (Yes), Quality Company (TBD)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the ceiling mount did not work for my particular situation due to an error of my own accord, I was still very impressed with the quality of this ceiling mount.The packaging is first rate. All parts are packaged securely and very neatly in a medium size box. Inside the box it is very apparent that the manufacturer wants the consumer to have a frustration free experience assembling the ceiling mount. All hardware is separated into individual clear air bubble plastic wrap. Each bubble is labeled with either A, B, C etc identifying which hardware to use in each step in the instruction manual. I really give the manufacturer props for doing this as it shows that they put in time thinking about a way to make the assembly process as frustration free as possible.The product is steel and is painted black. Looks and feels like a quality paint job. The quality of the construction and materials used is also top notch. I did not notice any blemishes in the paint job or workmanship of the product. Assembly was very easy and the instructions were straight forward and not confusing. I liked how they included spacers for the VESA mount which are needed depending on the length of the screw holes on the back of your tv. Also included are lengthening brackets in case you have an a wider VESA mount pattern on the back of your tv.A drilling template is also included which is always nice especially when having to be pretty precise with screw placement. The template is made out of thick cardboard and is very sturdy. The template offers different screw hole configurations taking into account the different mounting configurations offered (ceiling/wall) as well as the surface you are installing it on (Concrete or wood). The only negative I had about the template and it&rsquo;s instructions was in regards to the number of screws I needed to drill for either mounting on wood or concrete.I ended up not using the mount. I had made a planning error prior to purchasing the mount and once I started to install it, I noticed that the mount wasn&rsquo;t going to be long enough. I have 10&rsquo; ceilings and the tv would be far too high in relation to my seating position causing me to look up at the screen as opposed to straight ahead. Probably the biggest negative about my whole experience with this product is the customer service. Once I figured out the mount was to short for my particular application, I contacted the manufacturer via phone and email to inquire about adding some type of extension pole to add additional length to the mount. I was hoping that they may sell something like this to help in my particular situation but unfortunately they were unreachable via phone and never responded to my email. So as of right now, I&rsquo;m still undecided about how I&rsquo;m going to go about resolving my issue. I hope this review helps in figuring out if this mount is right for you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect. We have it in the living room and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too much of an eye sore or anything. People usually just comment that it&rsquo;s cool or a good idea or whatever. We have a idk like 48&rdquo; TV I think.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-that-i-could-swivel-the-television-from-left-to">I like that I could swivel the television from left to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like that I could swivel the television from left to right with ease, but I am not able to tilt it up and down without loosening the screws then tightening them back up after adjusting it up or down. I thought that I would be able to make the tilt with ease like I do with my wall mount. Also I wanted the television to hang about 4 inches longer, but the pole was. Otherwise long enough, but it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
