<h5 id="great-boat">Great boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well if you are reading this you are probably considering buying this boat. Great choice but before you purchase understand this is more than a $150 boat and it has some limitations.First and foremost it does not seat 5 people. It is more of a 2 to maybe 3 adults. 2 adults and a couple of kids would work pretty well.Second, trying to row this big boat is tough. You will want a trolling motor for this boat.Third, at least in North Dakota, if you put a trolling motor on any boat, including inflatables, it needs to be registered with game and fish and you have to follow boating laws. (If you dont put a motor on it you shouldnt have to register it)Fourth, this is an air boat, it works extremely well on little to no current. I havent tried it in a river with a current yet but i dont think i want to.Overall im very pleased with this boat. It seems to be tough as the vinyl is thicker than an air mattress. The fishing pole holders seem cheap and in dont think id trust my poles using them. The boat is very portable but is pretty heavy. Much easier to load and unload with 2 people. Also this boat is rated for 1300 pounds people and equipment weight. I have at least 800 pounds in my boat at all times and it floats great and moves pretty good (5 mphish) with the trolling motor.Alright, if you are still reading here are my suggestions of what you should buy with the purchase of this boat.1. Trolling motor mounting kit2. Trolling motor (i used a minn kota endura max 40 thrust). The boat is only rated to 30 thrust or 1.5 hp (33lbs max motor weight according to the box) but im pretty confident you could fit a bigger motor on this if you wanted to.3. Minn kota power center battery box. This box is great, it shows you battery life remaining and has spots for dc power so you can charge your phone and whatnot.4. A 29 series deep cycle battery. I used an everstart maxx 29 from walmart5. Minn kota portable battery charger. I like this charger because it has overcharge protection and is very lightweight and easy to use.6. A 4 pack of life vests. I bought the orange cheapos but they work fine just to be legal7. An air horn8. An anchor. I think mine is 3 or 5 lbs. Trust me you want an anchor as the boat floats away easily when you are trying to stay still.9. I bought a fire extinguisher. Not required by law but it makes me feel safer10. Bow and stearn light (green/red for bow and white for back). I found a set for inflatables on amazon and they are AA battery powered.11. An electric air pump. I bought a dc powered one so i can use the truck at the lake to power the pump and inflate the boat.12. Industrial strength outdoor velcro. Stuff kind of flops around in the boat. Velcro keeps stuff organized13. I would consider buying a couple large plastic bins to carry and store the boat14. Loctite! The bolts holding the motor mount seem to loosen on their own. Using some loctite should help that15. I am buying led light strips for my boat for better lighting at night16. Buy dock bumpers if you plan on landing this at a dock. You dont want sharp metal or wood puncturing it</p>

<h5 id="really-awesome-investment">Really awesome investment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this boat for our family trip to South Lake Tahoe, and we were very excited. I must say this boat held its own..Inside of our boat was my husband along with of course me, our three older children and our infant. We also had the life jackets our clothes in a bag and our blower that we used to set it up. We had about atleast 600lbs in the boat.The boat1. Felt very sturdy. Once inside of it I felt completely safe. I did not feel like it was going to capsize or collapse. It felt very sturdy and safe. I expected this to feel like a floatie&hellip; ya know the ones that you get for the pool. So I wasn&rsquo;t sure how serious to take this boat. I was pleasantly surprised though. This is the real deal.. a good boat.2. My children were climbing in and out of the boat, and the boat held up. It did not have any give, and let any water come in as they wee existing an entering the boat. My son weighs about 110 and my oldest daughter weighs 64lbs, so they were putting a bit of weight on the sides while climbing in and out.3. This boat actually did very well on rocks. Going in and out of the water we were subjected to so many rocks on the shallow floor I just knew our boat was going to pop. The rocks were as far as I knew pretty smooth, but my husband had to drag the boat out about 10 or more feet to get to the area where we could begin to float and it was very very rocky beneath the boat. There were no holes in the boat from these rocks which I am grateful for. So this boat can for sure stand up to rocks if exposed. I wouldn&rsquo;t go trying this out of course, and throwing the boat into sharp rocks just for kicks. But for average rock exposure, this for sure can handle it. The material is very thick, and durable.4. The oars are pretty s<strong><em>ty so I would for sure advise to get better oars. We actually wanted to try it with the oars before purchasing a trolling motor for the boat. It is hard to steer with those plastic thin oars it comes with since the boat is so big, and furthermore since the Oars are so horrible. When my husband was rowing he had to grip the oars so hard that the plastic around the boat that the oars are attached to begin to pull up. He did this for awhile of course since we had to get back to shore, and I am happy it didnt tear. He is a tall guy 6&rsquo;3 with long arms so if you are a big guy or someone with long arms these oars will not work for you. Also&hellip;. they are s</em></strong>ty.. ( Just to reiterate)5. The seats are really comfortable which I was surprised by. I had a baby 6 months ago, and my back is in pretty bad shape from the gain in the chest area, so I was worried about the support my back would have while in the boat. I was able to lean back, and the seats were comfortable. They actually provided support on my back like a chair. It was lovely..Overall I am very happy with the purchase of this boat. We are now looking at motors to buy for it, and in the facebook group I am in for this boat I saw a guy create a canopy with a tent, so that is what we are going to do. Also people have build floors for the boat which I could see being good for the boat.This is great I love this boat&hellip;If my review was helpful dont be stingy with the helpful button click down there. I tired to put all I could think of, and make it really helpful for you. Click the helpful button :)</p>
