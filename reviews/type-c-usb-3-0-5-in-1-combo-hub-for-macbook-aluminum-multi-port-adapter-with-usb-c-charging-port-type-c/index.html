<h5 id="worth-the-price">Worth the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own a new MacBook , Which has two USB type c ports. And I need a usb c hub to make my new macbook work more easily. I am very impressed by the versatile functions of this USB-C hub. I have tested it for a week, and I plugged the mouse and my iphone 7 to 2 usb ports, one SD and one Micro SD card to SD card slots. All the units that plugged to the device are working good. By the way, reading the pictures and fil from sd card is fast as wellthis type c hub is slim design, and it only takes small space on my desktop. it&rsquo;s a great help when i travel with macbook. great buy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With some trepidation, I ordered the Landhoo Type C USB for my new GPD Pocket UMPC. It cost less than most Type Cs with the same specs, at least $20 or more. Was I pleasantly surprised? GPD reneged on its plans to provide a genuine Type C Hub with the shipment of its new UMPC and many buyers were not happy. The GPD forums also contained critical comments from purchasers who tried other hubs. The Landhoo Type C hub worked perfectly right out of the small box. Small, light-weight, it satisfied all of my needs for extra ports. The one disconcerting thing about it is that is must be slid into the Type C port upside down. Doing so covers the other ports on the right side. Its light weight also risks it being dislodged if tapped or touch hard. But overall I am very satisfied with the device, especially since it fills a need for the new GPD Pocket. Other GPD Pocket buyers will find it similarly useful, I am sure.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-quality">Very nice quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super nice!! The new Macbook I don&rsquo;t why they re-designed the sides and obviously there&rsquo;s always no room for me to plug in several things at the same time. This really works and the quality is so good! The material looks exactly like my macbook and you can hardly imagine it only costs less than $40 while you gotta spend at least $80 at an apple store lol. Don&rsquo;t fall for Apple&rsquo;s trick and get this here on Amazon</p>

<h5 id="slim-and-mutli-function-attachment-to-my-tablet">Slim and mutli-function attachment to my tablet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently bought a two in one mobile device that has a type C port, so I am in the process of buying and testing various Type C hub for use. This is the 1st one that I got with two USB 3, SD and micro SD. Everything worked as described and it looks very slick just right attaching to the side of the device. The type C interface attached to the tablet without any bending or slipping. So far, I like it very much.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly Recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect accessory to the Macbook pro with its usb c only connectivity.Gives me all the ports I need to get work done and still allows charging.Product comes in some nice packaging and an even nicer leather pouch for it.Matches Macbook colour very closely and build quality is of this adapter feels very sturdy.Cant fault it for the price. It works as expected, so far so good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="convience">Convience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy and convenience to bring around the combo hub anywhere. I usually have this hub to the library, where I have to pull a lot of my files from diff drives. I know there is google drive and a lot of online storage, but pull a big file online is always painful. It meets my need, seems really durable, no complaint so far</p>

<h5 id="this-little-type-c-adapter-is-great-the-color-matches-my-laptop-color-and-looks">This little type c adapter is great. The color matches my laptop color and looks &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small size and very functional. This little type c adapter is great. The color matches my laptop color and looks great when plugged into the side of the laptop. I have used my usb-c cable plugged into the usb c port and it also can charge my macbook as well. I also test the SD card slot and it works good. All the files transfer well and quickly. All work pretty well, very functional.</p>

<p>The product feels solid. Main downside for me, as a 15 in. MacBook Pro (touch bar) user. The adaptor completely covers the second port, next to the one that its plugged into.</p>
