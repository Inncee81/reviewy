<p>Powerful Zoom, Spectacular Image Quality
30x Optical Zoom
No matter the situation, you can be confident that the PowerShot SX700 HS camera&rsquo;s genuine Canon 30x Optical Zoom (35mm equivalent: 25–750mm) will capture images with exceptional brilliance and clarity. Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. And Zoom Framing Assist delivers automatic tracking, so you can easily reframe long-zoom shots without losing your subject. Even the camera&rsquo;s easy-to-grip shape is specifically designed for a secure hold and steady shooting.</p>

<p>Zoom Framing Assist
The PowerShot SX700 HS camera has the telephoto reach to capture subjects a long distance away using its powerful 30x Optical Zoom. At maximum telephoto, however, it can be challenging to track a moving subject. The Zoom Framing Assist seek function makes it much easier to use the camera&rsquo;s powerful zoom lens. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist function button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you&rsquo;re ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position.</p>

<p>You can also use Zoom Framing Assist to keep your subject&rsquo;s face the same size in your frame no matter how they move. Tap the Zoom Framing Assist function button to detect your subject&rsquo;s face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It&rsquo;s especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. And, for even more convenience, the Zoom Framing Assist function is also available when shooting video.</p>

<p>Share Images and Video Wherever and Whenever</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi® makes sharing quick and easy

<p>Phenomenal Images and Incredible Performance Start Here
16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor
The PowerShot SX700 HS camera features a 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor to make even your everyday photography remarkable. The large sensor takes in more light, so images are clear and beautifully detailed. High ISO shots are particularly impressive, with less noise and expanded dynamic range. And the 16.1 Megapixel resolution gives you the flexibility to be more creative with your shots: crop and enlarge any part of an image – you can be confident that the detail and resolution you need are there.</p>

<p>DIGIC 6 Image Processor
The PowerShot SX700 HS camera is equipped with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which makes several important advancements to image quality both in stills and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that&rsquo;s exceptionally free of distortion. The processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot SX700 HS, enabling high-speed, high quality continuous still image shooting at up to 8.5 frames per second. And video recording is better than ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD at 60p, as well as MP4 recording. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. Plus, with MF Peaking possible thanks to the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, you&rsquo;ll have a pro-level focusing tool at your disposal.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM
The PowerShot SX700 HS gives you the power to capture beautifully detailed, naturally lit images even in low light – reducing the need for flash and the occasionally unwelcome effects it produces. That&rsquo;s because the camera&rsquo;s 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works with the camera&rsquo;s latest generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM, specifically engineered for spectacular low-light performance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you&rsquo;ll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at ISO speeds up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.</p>

<p>Stunning Full HD Video That&rsquo;s Better Than Ever
Capture stunning 1080p/60p Full HD video with a dedicated movie button
The PowerShot SX700 HS not only preserves your special video memories with spectacular realism and detail, but also does it in a format that makes them easy to share. You can simply press the dedicated movie button to start and stop video recording, so you&rsquo;re always ready to capture the moment as it happens. The camera records in stunningly realistic 1080p Full HD so even when played back on a big-screen HDTV, your videos are crystal clear, with smooth action and beautifully natural color. You can choose to record in 30 fps or 60 fps, so even fast-moving subjects are captured with crisp detail. And videos are recorded in MP4 format, perfectly sized for quick online sharing – whether you&rsquo;re showing relatives what the kids are up to or posting status updates on social networking sites.</p>

<p>Rethink Photography with Creative Shot
Creative Shot mode
In addition to its super-powerful 30x Optical Zoom, the PowerShot SX700 HS also turns out impressive artistic photos with Creative Shot mode. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.</p>

Once your device is registered on the camera, simply press the Mobile Device Connect button for easy connection.</p>

<p>By connecting to a smartphone with the CameraWindow app using the Mobile Device Connect Button, you can browse and share images while still leaving the camera inside a bag.

Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; shots.

<p>Additional Features
Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX700 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
ECO Mode
The PowerShot SX700 HS features ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when you&rsquo;re out shooting for the day or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. The mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi® featured on the camera. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.</p>

<h5 id="great-travel-zoom">Great Travel Zoom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the recent few years Canon has made great efforts to improve their travel-zoom compact cameras, and the new SX700 is their next remarkable achievement on that way. It&rsquo;s a little bit bigger than its predecessor (SX280) but it is very well built and has an attractive look and feel (I like the black one). It also got a new front grip which makes one-hand shooting more convenient, even when shooting video, since the Video button was moved from the back to the top and you can now use your thumb solely for holding the camera.Here is a brief list of the new camera pros &amp; cons:PROS:* A very good design and build quality with the attractive finish.* A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens in just a pocket-size body.* Incredible range from 25mm wide to 750mm telephoto for stills and video.* Zoom Framing Assist - very useful new feature to compose your pictures at long telephoto.* Very effective optical Intelligent Image Stabilization for stills.* 5-axis Dynamic Image Stabilization and continuous AF for movies.* New 16MP high-resolution, high-speed CMOS Sensor.* The recent DIGIC6 processor with a new advanced Noise Reduction algorithm.* Intelligent Contrast system to retain shadow detail in high contrast scenes.* Full HD 1920 x 1080, 60 fps progressinve movie recording in a popular MP4 format.* Good-quality stereo microphones facing the subject being recorded.* A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording, now on the top of the camera.* A new high-resolution 922K, 3&rdquo; display.* WiFi and NFC (Near Field Communication) features for transferring files to your smartphone or tablet.* Short startup time (just about 1 sec) and no any noticeable shutter Lag.* Almost the same battery (NB-6LH) as for SX280 (NB-6L) - old one works fine .CONS:* Slightly bigger and heavier than its predecessor SX280.* A new Noise Reduction algorithm is more aggressive on low-contrast areas.I&rsquo;m basically a photo-amateur, but sometimes I do big prints and so my first priority is the image quality, and in particular its clarity at the pixel level. That&rsquo;s why my recent travel-zoom cameras consequently were SX230, SX260, and SX280, since Canon is doing all their best to preserve the fine details of the picture even at higher ISO&rsquo;s. With my recent SX280 I took many good pictures - sharp and clean, with nice colors, however while doing some research regarding the new SX700 camera features and characteristics I got a number of reasons for upgrade which I would like to share with you. Actually there are 3 main reasons: 30x Zoom Lens, 16-Megapixel CMOS sensor, and the advanced DIGIC 6 processor with the new Noise Reduction Algorithm.LENS: A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens with an Optical Image Stabilization, which spans an incredible 25-750mm equivalent range in a pocket-sized body, is a significant improvement over the SX280&rsquo;s 20x range. The real achievement is that the aperture of the new lens at its maximum 30x telephoto end drops to almost the same (F/6.9) value as of its predecessor at only 20x (F/6.8), what means the additional zoom will not cost you the increased ISO and therefore will not bring more noise to your pictures.On the other hand, when wide-open, the new lens provides slightly better aperture - F/3.2 than the older one - F/3.5, what gives you some advantage for shooting in low light conditions. The new SX700 also introduces an interesting feature - Zoom Framing Assist, which should help with composing shots of far distant subjects. I have to play with it for a while to find out how it actually works.SENSOR: The newly designed <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; CMOS sensor can produce 16 Megapixel images while having actually 17 MP - it seems extra pixels are needed to provide additional digital image stabilization along with the existing optical one, what would be very helpful for shooting with such a long zoom. From the prospective of the image resolution, it is nice to step up from the prior 12 MP to the new 16 MP especially for landscape photos, what allows to present more fine details and to make your pictures to look more natural than before. Of course, packing more megapixels into the same sensor size causes less light to be collected by each pixel, but on the other hand, Canon stated this new one is a &ldquo;High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor&rdquo; and also a new noise-reduction algorithm works more effectively, so such a resolution leap should not cause any noticeable deterioration in IQ.I&rsquo;m really thankful to Canon especially for the two design decisions: for years they were not following that crazy mega-pixels race; and they were not afraid to generate large (up to 10MB) jpeg files in &ldquo;Large&rdquo; mode to preserve as much fine details as possible. Having got such detailed jpeg files you can have much less regret of not having the RAW output, than if your camera always packed your pictures into just 2-3 MB with a lot of smearing and smudging in low contrast areas. On the other hand if you don&rsquo;t need so detailed pictures you can always select either &ldquo;Medium&rdquo; or &ldquo;Small&rdquo; file size.NOISE REDUCTION: The Canon SX700 uses the recent Canon&rsquo;s DIGIC 6 processor, which was first introduced in the SX280 model and provided the improved noise reduction technique especially at higher ISO&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a kind of luxury for such a small camera to have such an advanced processor, and at the moment of writing this review only a few enthusiast&rsquo;s Canon cameras like G1X II, G16, S120 was equipped with that powerful picture processing engine.Although both cameras SX280 and SX700 use the same processor, the latest model has more advanced Noise Reduction Algorithm which provides more smooth rendering of the low-contrast areas with significantly less visible noise. People say one picture is worth a thousand words, but the Amazon rules do not allow to include external links to pictures in the text of the review itself, however they do not mind them in the comments. So I put those links with the respective explanations into my own comments and so you can treat them as a part of this review. Actually you will find there the links to the two 100%-crop fragments of green leaves taken by the old and new camera respectively. While the most bright areas on both fragments look pretty much the same, the areas with less light on the older camera&rsquo;s shots show the noticeable noise, while the SX700&rsquo;s counterparts look almost clear, however a bit softer.LOW_LIGHT: Both cameras have pretty similar and one of best on the market High Sensitivity (HS) system for taking pictures in low-light conditions with minimal noise. In many cases if you shoot even at the highest ISO and then browse those pictures on you monitor without additional cropping, you hardly can see any noise at all (since even Full HD monitors have resolution just about 2MP, and the most advanced - not more than 3-4MP). So from that prospective the difference between two cameras is not that big: the new SX700 provides slightly less visible noise (if any at all) but at the price of somewhat softer images, however all those imperfections of both cameras for most of the ISO range from 100 to about 800 in reality are visible only on the really big prints, and only above ISO-800 the smearing of the fine details becomes visible. So both cameras can be considered as good players in the low-light league. I took the 2 series of shots at high ISO with both cameras, and for the viewers convenience I put them as the 2nd part into my most first comment for this review.SHARPNESS: The sharpness of the output jpeg pictures pretty much depends on the &ldquo;Compression&rdquo; settings: to get the maximum details you have to select the &ldquo;Super Fine&rdquo; mode, which will produce the jpeg files with the size up to 10MB. If you don&rsquo;t need big prints you can choose &ldquo;Fine&rdquo; compression which will result in jpeg files about 5MB or less for the full 16MP resolution. Be aware that with the &ldquo;Fine&rdquo; setting the pictures at 100%-crop will look significantly softer at any ISO, however if you browse them on your monitor in the full-screen mode they will look almost the same. Also if you&rsquo;re only going to upload them on Internet or make small prints, you can even choose instead of &ldquo;Large&rdquo; resolution the &ldquo;Medium&rdquo; one (actually there two of them - &ldquo;M1&rdquo; with 8MP and &ldquo;M2&rdquo; with 3MP) what will produce even smaller files and will give you more room on your flash memory card and hard disk.So I took some comparative test shots with my both cameras SX280 and SX700 at the ISO-100, max resolution, and the Super-Fine compression in the range of the equivalent focal lengths from 25mm to 500mm. Since the both cameras have a pretty good noise reduction mechanisms, the noise is not visible on all those shots, and the only difference is in the effective sharpness, which can vary in the zoom range. I put the links to those shots into my comment on 04/10/14 with the respective explanations.SAMPLE_PICTURES: I&rsquo;ve uploaded some real-world pictures and you can get links to them in my comment with the respective title posted on 04/13/2014.VIDEO: As the same as its predecessor, this camera can capture stunning 1080p 60p/30p Full HD video using a dedicated movie button which now resides on the top of the camera. And to provide sharp results the new SX700 is equipped with an Intelligent Image Stabilization system plus 5-axis Dynamic IS for steady movies.VIDEO_SAMPLES: I&rsquo;ve uploaded some video clips and you can get links to them in my comment with the respective title posted on 04/11/2014.So this new Canon camera is a very good compact device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording.</p>

<p>I got this camera because I wanted to be able to do better close-up nature shots from farther away. I had been using my phone camera previously, so I&rsquo;m not particularly knowledgeable about photography, nor did I want to have to get into the nittygritty to be able to take good close-up pictures from a distance. This camera is the perfect balance for me of features, cost, and size. My pictures have improved tremendously, and now when we go to nature reserves, I can get that great picture with an essentially point-and-shoot experience. It takes good pictures both indoors and outdoors, has good battery life, and fits in my purse. It&rsquo;s also light enough that I can hold it steady when using it zoomed all the way out, and even when I can tell my hands are not quite holding it steady, it compensates for the shake &ndash; I rarely have out-of-focus pictures. My husband has a much better camera, but my pictures are just as good, with the exception of a little bit of detail from far away.The alligator in the attached picture was about 25 yards away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, a confession. I do own this camera, but purchased it elsewhere because it was available prior to Amazon&rsquo;s availability date. I won&rsquo;t repeat much of what&rsquo;s already been said, but hopefully amplify a little. There&rsquo;s much to like about this camera: long 30x zoom, quick and accurate focus, true HD video, relatively good build quality. I concur with the majority of the pros I&rsquo;ve seen in other reviews, but would offer a couple of cons that may be important to some potential buyers:- TOKEN GRIP: While I&rsquo;m sure the grip on this camera is better than the one on its predecessors, it&rsquo;s still hardly a grip. I&rsquo;ve come close to dropping the camera a couple of times and always keep the strap around my wrist. In efforts to make the camera as small as possible, Canon has offered not much more than a token bump in the case. My old A650&rsquo;s grip is much better and, frankly, while it&rsquo;s physically larger, I don&rsquo;t find it unwieldy at all.- STIFF MODE SELECTION DIAL: Don&rsquo;t think for a minute that you can change the mode without getting a good grip on the camera first and using both your thumb and forefinger to rotate the dial. It&rsquo;s stiffer than all get-out, small, and feels plasticky compared to every other Canon I&rsquo;ve owned, and I&rsquo;ve owned several.- SUPER FINE RESOLUTION: Not available in Auto. What??!?! Not that going to Program mode in order to select it is the end of the world, but why, Canon, why? I see a significant difference in quality in many shots between the fine resolution provided in Auto mode and the Super Fine resolution that can be chosen in Program mode.- FLASH RECOVERY TIMES: Still a wait-and-see, but they were pretty long on first powering up the camera, occasionally 3 seconds of seeing &ldquo;Busy&rdquo; on the screen between shots. Flash is not this camera&rsquo;s strong suit in any case. I have noticed fewer problems after shooting with the camera for several days, but remain leery.- MANUAL FLASH SELECTION: Not only must you pop up the flash manually, but it&rsquo;s a tiny, inconvenient switch on the side where your hand will never naturally land. I have lost more than a few shots fumbling to get the darn thing open!- BATTERY LIFE: It&rsquo;s relatively, well, miserable. I have yet to swap in the 1700 mAh spares I purchased, but hope they add a few exposures to what the supplied battery can provide. With an extra set of lithium AAs, my A650 will get about 1,300 shots at high (12 mp), super fine resolution, and I can shoot nearly that in a day away from stores where batteries can be purchased or recharged. I predict I&rsquo;m looking at perhaps no more than 60% of that with the Canon battery and two fully-charged, higher capacity spares.- OVERLY AGRESSIVE NOISE REDUCTION: I&rsquo;d much rather do the retouching on my computer and be selective about how much to apply, and where. Sometimes detail with noise is more palatable than loss of detail and less noise.None of these is a show-stopper for me, and there is indeed a lot to like, but I can&rsquo;t call this the best camera ever made. My A650 takes better pictures a significant percentage of the time and will continue to be in my camera bag until it eventually gives up the ghost. I had a 40D for a while with an L glass lens and it took significantly better pictures than either this camera or the A650, but lugging around a $3,000 brick didn&rsquo;t match my lifestyle. Choosing the SX700 HS is, I think, more about matching your lifestyle than it is about getting the best images for the buck.UPDATE April 17, 2014: On first unpacking this camera and inserting the charged Canon battery, I immediately began to take flash photos. To my dismay, it took about 3 seconds before the &ldquo;Busy&rdquo; message disappeared from the screen and I was able to shoot the next shot. In an extended conversation with a very pleasant and helpful support tech at Canon, she ultimately found a new SX700 HS in the box, inserted a freshly charged battery, took a flash picture and sure enough, reported that it took nearly 5 seconds for the &ldquo;Busy&rdquo; message to disappear and the camera to be ready to take the next shot. Something inside the camera&rsquo;s flash mechanism needs an initial shot of juice before the flash works as expected. Perhaps if one takes just available light shots for several hours before using the flash this&rsquo;ll happen quietly and they&rsquo;ll never notice it. But if you take flash pictures straight out of the box, at least, be prepared for, but not alarmed by, this disconcerting behavior. Good news is, the problem does go away fairly quickly, and my camera no longer exhibits this problem.UPDATE May 17, 2014: I have had no problems at all with lengthy &ldquo;Busy&rdquo; messages since the initial out-of-the-box experience. Also, to those aware of the SX280&rsquo;s battery issues with video, I can report that I didn&rsquo;t get much more than 5-6 minutes of HD video on my SX700 HS with the stock battery before the low battery indicator started flashing, although I had previously taken perhaps 30 still shots without flash, with the camera on and ready to shoot a good chunk of the time. On the other hand, I took a video of approximately 8 minutes in duration with the Vivitar 1700 mAh batteries without seeing a low battery warning, although the camera got pretty hot in the process. I highly recommending getting at least one on the Vivitars as a spare if you&rsquo;re planning to be away from your charger with this camera for any length of time.</p>
