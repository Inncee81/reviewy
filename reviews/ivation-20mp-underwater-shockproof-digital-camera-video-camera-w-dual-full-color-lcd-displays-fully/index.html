<h5 id="great-waterproof-video-picture-camera-for-price">Great waterproof video/picture camera for price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a waterproof camera to take on the family vacation that I could reuse (ie. not a disposable). I figured I&rsquo;d give this one a try since it was only $80, digital, took still pictures and video, and the dual display feature seemed neat. I got this with Prime shipping with enough time to test it out before vacation. Note: the batteries and microSD card do not come with the camera as it states. So if you do purchase this, also get the microSD card. Amazon packaged it with the SanDisk. I got a 32G microSD card for $13. That was cheaper than other vendors I checked out.I tested it in the pool with my daughter and took video and pictures. I attached a picture, here&rsquo;s the video link <a href="https://youtu.be/jnU55pOE6f4">https://youtu.be/jnU55pOE6f4</a>. It was pretty good quality for the price paid. I didn&rsquo;t want to pay $$$ for a GoCam or equivalent, so for $80 I&rsquo;m really happy with my purchase. Other reviewers thought less of the item, but perhaps they just got a bad one. IMO I&rsquo;m happy I got this for vacation. By the way, my daughter dropped this several times already and it is pretty rugged.</p>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a waterproof camera to use on a vacation to Mexico. We knew we would snorkel and such so I wanted something cheaper we could use for that.This camera turned out to be awesome for us. It is exactly what it says. We took many pictures above and below the water with this and nearly all turned out great.Understanding a cameras limits on power, we did purchase lithium batteries for it as designed. We took 160 pictures (all in high sunlight so no flash was used) but we still had <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> left on the batteries. I never changed them out on our 10 day trip and still have plenty left. I have no problem opening the door, i just read the instructions. push the lock while sliding. Opened right up and we were set.All in all, please let me say this this camera took our 10th anniversary pictures and these were the best of the bunch because we took them in and on the water where we could not take our other camera, and you cant tell the difference between the two when we look at them on the PC.</p>

<h5 id="i-wished-it-had-worked">I wished it had worked</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I might have gotten a lemon, but I could not even to get it to power up out of the box. I used 2 sets of new batteries and tried to put them in any possible combination just to make sure I was not doing something wrong. The device itself did feel sturdy and I like the feel and the idea that I could have a lower cost camera that I did not need to worry about.Maybe others will have more luck than me.</p>

<h5 id="solid-little-point-and-shoot-with-a-few-shortcomings">Solid little Point and Shoot, with a few shortcomings.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ivation 20MP Underwater Shockproof Digital Camera &amp; Video Camera w/Dual Full-Color LCD Displays - Fully Waterproof &amp; Submersible Up to 10 Feet (Blue)After enduring a ton of blurry and unfocused images that our son would take with our cell phones, my wife and I decided to get him a camera of his own. The first one she got was a cheap piece of plastic that pretty much broke after it was dropped the first time. So I decided to get one that was sturdy, maybe even waterproof. And lo and behold, found this Ivation 20MP camera, for just a little bit more money than what my wife paid for the original one we had. I had my doubts, but it was cheap enough to take a risk on. I reviewed the pictures people posted and was impressed with the quality. It is a 20 megapixel camera, after all, albeit a point and shoot.My son was the first to try it out, and of course, dropped it a few times&hellip;. but it kept working. We brought it on a trip to Disney where I got some pretty decent pictures with it. Nice and clear&hellip; even the pool pictures were quite good&ndash;just had to make sure you keep it very still.So&hellip; Pro&rsquo;s: good quality pictures, up to 20mp( can also do 14 and 8 and 5, I think), multiple effects built into camera, multiple ISO settings and white balance, EXCELLENT selfie cam. Waterproof up to 10ft. Shockproof. Small and onobtrusive, and fits in your shirt pocket.Con&rsquo;s: Flash is slow to charge; eats up batteries like the Cookie monster eating Thin Mints; changing the batteries wipes out date/time settings&ndash; all my pictures from last week are now dated 01-01-15; it does not like movement when taking pictures(either by the subject or of the camera)&ndash; unless you&rsquo;re into that Blur/Bokeh thing.Yet overall, it was a good camera for the price. My son can play with it all he wants, the 16Gb card I placed in it can handle over 1800 pics in 20MP quality. I&rsquo;ll just have to go through and edit and/or delete a lot of what he takes.</p>

<h5 id="maybe-look-for-a-different-camera">Maybe look for a different camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The picture quality of this camera is great. The price/performance is great. Unfortunately that&rsquo;s about all the good I can say about it. I purchased this primarily to take pictures while in the pool. Since I bought it just before the season, I didn&rsquo;t really get much of a chance to use it until <em>after</em> the Amazon returns window closed. The camera doesn&rsquo;t hold the date, so I have to remember to set the date every time I use it, and it really eats batteries. I have to replace the batteries after about 100 pictures&hellip;..</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So Far&hellip; So Good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this camera to take pictures for our upcoming cave rescue training. I am most interested in the ruggedness and waterproofness of the camera. Our trip is not until next weekend, but I&rsquo;ve taken a few pics with it and&hellip; so far so good. I&rsquo;m impressed with the picture quality for the price.Unlike in other reviews, I had no trouble accessing the memory card / battery bay. One thing to note however, is it does take a bit of time to power up when you first turn it on. I initially was afraid it wasn&rsquo;t working, but if you press the power button and give it some time, it powers up fine.I&rsquo;ll update my review on the other aspects of the camera after the cave class.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera-for-a-great-price">Great Camera for a Great Price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little waterproof camera did GREAT!! I bought it to use when my Hubby and I went snorkeling in Mexico, but didn&rsquo;t want to pay a huge price. Well, this camera did an amazing job and I had NO issues at all! Turns out, I didn&rsquo;t even have the micro sd card inserted all the way - you have to really push it in down deep - but I guess when I closed the battery door it pushed the sd card down where it was supposed to be&hellip;anyway, it still take great pics even though I didn&rsquo;t have the sd card inserted fully! &hellip;Great little camera for a great price!</p>
