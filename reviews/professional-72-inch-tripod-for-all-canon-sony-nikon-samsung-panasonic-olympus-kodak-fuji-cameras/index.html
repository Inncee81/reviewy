<h5 id="its-a-sub-20-dollar-tripod-and-a-decent-one-at-that">Its a sub-20 dollar tripod, and a decent one at that</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its a $20 tripod. You get what you pay for. I bought two different models in this price range to see which one I liked better, turns out I like them both. I shoot documentary films in outdoor, rough, out of the way settings. I did my time dragging expensive tripods through mud and setting them up in water. Expensive doesn&rsquo;t translate to longevity where we shoot. I put my HVR-V1U on top of this with a light and mic. Seems pretty sturdy. I will keep an eye on it while filming, but I do that with a six hundred dollar Manfrotto anyways. I think for less that twenty bucks, it&rsquo;s a great value. I was expecting less for sure. Someone mentioned not putting pro-sumer camcorders or DSLR&rsquo;s on this tripod. I&rsquo;d disagree&hellip;just watch it. Use the hook to add some stability. It&rsquo;s a sub $20 tripod, treat it like one. If you are looking for seamless pans, this may not be your ticket. However, I lubed up the head and it seems to be a lot better. There&rsquo;s my 48 cents.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-value-in-a-tripod-i-have-ever-seen">Best value in a tripod I have ever seen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you shoot professionally for a living, you probably can afford something much more expensive than this very inexpensive tripod. if you&rsquo;re an amateur or enthusiast photographer on the other hand, and you spent a bunch of money on lenses and you want to save money on a tripod, this might be just what you&rsquo;re looking for. Although it certainly cannot remotely compete with high-end $600 carbon fiber tripods, for the money it&rsquo;s certainly a great deal, and works well. It&rsquo;s relatively stable, can hold the camera in either portrait or landscape mode, and has all the usual pivots in various axes. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d trust the top release plate with a really heavy camera in a portrait orientation with a great big telephoto on the front of it (not 100% convinced that you wouldn&rsquo;t be putting your camera at dire risk) but aside from that limitation, it&rsquo;s a very good tripod - and it does handle my camera safely in portrait orientation with a medium sized telephoto without making me unduly anxious about losing my camera off the mount. If you are working with a big telephoto, would definitely use a lens collar.Pros:1) 72 inches tall for a professional height (means you don&rsquo;t have to be stooping over to look at anything)2) full rotation in standard three axes3) comes with a nice (albeit cheap) case4) relatively lightweight5) reasonable stability for a lightweight tripod6) decent level detection (don&rsquo;t need that with my camera however)7) cheap - really cheapCons:1) quick release plate might not hold heaviest cameras in portrait orientation with big heavy lens2) probably doesn&rsquo;t have the greatest stability relative to an hi-end professional tripod3) rotation in vertical axis is perhaps a little bit stiff and not as smooth as more expensive tripods</p>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great Buy!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read allot of reviews before I buy camera equipment, or anything else for that matter, so I am doing the same for you as others have done for me. I like to pass on info when I think it will help someone. Anyway, I had to get another tripod for general use so I researched and ended up buying this unit. I can tell you from one with 45yrs experiance that this is well worth the money. It is stable, light weight and solid. I ordered it for several reasons, but the three things (besides the value) I like most are these: First it is 67&rdquo; tall. This is good for tall people, and us not so tall people. Why? Because shooting things in the sky, or objects that are high up, you don&rsquo;t have to stupe down to make setting ajustments! (smart guy) Second, With a shot of siicon spray,(not that it needs it) this tripod pans very smooth. Third, (and allot of people don&rsquo;t know this) there is a hook on the underside that has two great uses. First, you can get an old corkscrew or any thing you want to use and put it in the ground where you set up, and simply attach a &ldquo;bungicord&rdquo; between the hook and whatever you put in the ground and your tripod and camera is more stable in high winds. Secondly, there are two levels on this unit and when you are shooting off of a benchmark (like a survey stake) you can hang a plum bulb on the hook and get the center of your location. Not many tripods have that. I was very happy when it arived, and I am still happy today. This is a great buy, believe me!! Pass some good info on, there are to many of the other kind of people in the world! Your welcome!!</p>

<h5 id="decent-for-lightweight-cameras-only">Decent for lightweight cameras only.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a serious photographer but don&rsquo;t make my living in the industry. This is an okay tripod for the price. Their description of &lsquo;professional&rsquo; is definitely a stretch though. I would never use this with a camera of any weight. This is a lightweight, flimsy tripod that works okay with Hero type extremely lightweight cameras up to the weight of a smartphone. It is essentially all plastic, even the fastners used to tighten the legs. The light weight is good for traveling and it has some good qualities designed into it. So, for it&rsquo;s price, it&rsquo;s fine. Just don&rsquo;t plan on using a heavy camera with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="needed-in-a-hurry-and-it-came-through">Needed in a hurry and it came through.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice tripod. I needed it to record video of my sisters wedding (And I had to use two day shipping to get it on time). You can remove the platform and screw on the camera, so you don&rsquo;t get a weird camera angle on the tripod. It also has a nice handle to hold tripod and move it around. The expandable legs are roughly around 5&rsquo;8&rdquo; when fully extended and spread out. And the adjustments you make will keep hold and not slide down (I have had tripods do that). It also has a nice bubble-level built in so you make sure your angle isn&rsquo;t skewed. My only issue is the tripod feels cheaply made and I felt as if I could snap one of the legs in half. It does come with a nice carrying case so you can fold it up and not have a weird tripod just sitting next to you.Pros:~Carrying case~Bubble-level~Removable platform to screw on camera~Handle~Secure adjustments~Fairly tall. About 5&rsquo;8&rdquo;Cons:~Feels cheaply made</p>
