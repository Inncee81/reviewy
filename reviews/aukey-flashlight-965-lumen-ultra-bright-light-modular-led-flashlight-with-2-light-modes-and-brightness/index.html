<h5 id="you-can-buy-anything-from-this-company-and-it-is-good">You can buy anything from this company and it is good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just look at the name - Aukey. You can buy anything from this company and it is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-light-poor-manual">Good light, poor manual</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Call me an idiot if you will. Got this light today and it wouldn&rsquo;t turn on. Figured the batteries needed charging only to find from a Spanish UTube post that there&rsquo;s a paper cap on the end of the battery that needs to be removed to complete the circuit. No mention of that or how to charge them. Working fine now, but in the course of all that I had a heck of a time getting the batteries in my charger, They fit if I really force them in. In any event, notwithstanding these issues, the flashlight is bright and well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-bright-well-machined-and-lightweight">Super bright, well machined and lightweight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice, well-built flashlight that is super bright. It uses, and comes with, two 18650 rechargeable batteries, which allow the LED to be driven to very bright levels. It has a side mounted switch that allows you to switch between four levels of brightness, the brightest is so bright that a brief flash in the eyes is blinding. It has a strobe mode as well, but I love that it is not part of the normal rotation of brightness modes (like almost every other similar light), rather, you must hold the button down for 4 seconds or so to get into strobe mode. The machining on this light is very smooth and tight. The parts screw together very smoothly. When I first unscrewed the rear cap to check on the batteries, the O-ring shown in the lower right of the picture fell out; unfortunately broken. So now my flashlight is no longer as water resistant as it should be, thus I deducted a star for that. Otherwise this light would be a very strong 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="very-pleased-with-this-flashlight">Very pleased with this flashlight.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very bright flashlight. Especially with both modules. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and i am very pleased. I like all of the different modes and options, and the button is very nice as well. The only thing i dont like is that you haft to hold the button down to turn it on, but thats not enough to deduct a star. I am very pleased with this flashlight and would highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-light-very-bright">Great light, very bright.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m sure it sounds weird but ever since I was a kid I always had a fascination with flashlights. I think it’s because I like gadgets and at one time they were one of the few hand held devices people owned and used.Needless to say, I have owned many flashlights and continue to track the advancements over the years.I purchased this light as I love the new LED technology and the brightness and low power consumption.After using this light, I found it to be up there with the best in this price range.Only downside: While the battery is chargeable, it does not come with a charging unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-bright-both-batteries-were-in-good-condition-when">Pretty bright! Both batteries were in good condition when &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty bright! Both batteries were in good condition when it arrived. The zooming could be better but still effective! Not 3000 lumens. Maybe 260-300 lumens. Still good!</p>

<h5 id="not-a-mag-light-but-thinner-and-bright">Not a MAG LIGHT but thinner and bright</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a Compact, Powerful LED Flashlight. It delivers an intense beam of light (up to 965 lumens) to pierce through the darkness, with a beam distance of up to 260m (853ft). It is a fixed light so you can adjust the beam but still a great amount of legit light. An effective and dependable flashlight, ideal for outdoor activities. Also features a flexible configuration, dual light modes, and a handy wrist strap. Flexible Modular Design Remove the rear section of this flashlight and replace the tail cap to reduce its length from 228mm (8.98”) to 160mm (6.3”), using only one of the two included 18650 Li-ion rechargeable batteries. Or keep the full length and both batteries for longer use without risk of being stuck in the dark, trying to change the battery. Also, could be used like a baton in self-defense except that it is not as intimidating as it is cute. The modular design gives you complete flexibility to meet your needs, activity, and duration of use. Adaptable Light Modes Dual light modes fit a wide range of usage situations like hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, and spelunking. Cycle through four brightness levels (Max, High, Medium, and Low) in Cool White mode quickly and easily by pressing the highly responsive and reliable multi-function button. Then switch to Strobe mode, by simply holding the button down for 4 seconds after turning it on, for maximum visibility and safety in hazardous situations. Built to Last Shock-resistant and IPX6-level water-resistant. Solid and lightweight aluminum alloy casing is remarkably rugged and reliable.One thing to note is that you will need to remove the black sticker cap covering one of the batteries or you will think the battery is DNA.</p>
