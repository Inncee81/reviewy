<h5 id="works-well-with-lumix-lx-100">Works well with Lumix LX-100</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this case as a belt pouch for a Lumix LX-100, which just fits. The LX-100 is a bit latrger than your average point-and-shoot, so it&rsquo;s tough finding a case that will hold it and still hang comfortably off a belt. This unit fits the bill nicely.One quibble: I&rsquo;d prefer a hard-shell case, since I use the LX-100 mainly for back country hiking. Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t been able to find one that will fit the LX-100. The padding on this soft case is a little better than average, but I am going to be an unhappy hiker if I take a spill and land on the camera. Oh well, hazards of the trail, I suppose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-case-for-a-good-price-with-some-caveats">Decent Case for a Good Price &ndash; With Some Caveats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this case for a Panasonic Lumix ZS50 camera, and ordered it to replace a similar case from a different manufacturer that had begun fraying after a couple of years of use. The zippers on this Lowepro case are holding up very well without any catches or broken teeth despite sometimes rough use and the material of the case itself is holding up very well.After extensive use, I find that the double-Velcro/double strap belt loop is both a blessing and a curse. The over-and-under arrangement (long strap comes down from the top &amp; velcros into place, then is reinforced by a short strap coming up from the bottom &amp; velcroing into place is strong enough to withstand severe pulls, tugs, catches, etc. that might otherwise dislodge the case &amp; camera. However, it also sometimes makes it difficult to get the case on &amp; off my belt quickly (not to mention that it&rsquo;s impossible to do so silently); the old case had a little less velcro and used a small snap to reinforce the hold, and I found that a little more convenient. I was also surprised by how small the space for a belt actually is when compared to the length of the main strap, but t date I&rsquo;ve not had any trouble fitting the case onto belts, backpack straps, etc.I had measured my camera (and old case) carefully before ordering this case and was surprised at how snug it turned out to be even without any of the extra (thin) high-density foam I had put in my old case for extra protection. This problem was remedied by taking a few minutes to gently pull on various parts of the case to stretch them a little, and now the camera fits into the case easily. However, I am finding that the camera still &ldquo;catches&rdquo; easily when pulling it out of the case, even with the main zippers open all the way; this problem may ease over time as the material of the case becomes less stiff with wear, but right now it&rsquo;s a (small but real) annoyance. I&rsquo;ve also found the outside pocket is a tighter fit than on my old case (can really only fit 1 spare battery instead of 2).Overall, I have no buyer&rsquo;s remorse and think the Portland 20 is a decent product that&rsquo;s appropriately priced. I&rsquo;ll see how long it lasts and will shop around a bit for its replacement when the time comes, but would also be willing to buy the same case again.</p>

<h5 id="great-case-for-canon-sx700">Great Case For Canon SX700</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this case for the Canon SX280, and am now using it for the Canon SX700. It has a large pocket where the camera fits very comfortably and a nice zippered pocket on front for batteries and SD cards. I don&rsquo;t go out of the house without the camera in the bag, which is on my belt, using the belt loop on the back.Besides being a good size for the camera, there are 2 other things I like about the bag:1. There are 2 zippers for the main compartment I generally use both, with zippers meeting at the top. That allows me to unzip whatever is necessary to remove the camera while still keeping the camera securely in the bag until I lift it out.2. However, the second feature I like is even more important with respect to keeping the camera in the bag. The zippers do not go all the way down. They go far enough to easily remove the camera, but not so far it is likely to fall out. This saved me recently from losing the camera. I was traveling on a plane just after getting the camera. To help pass the time, I took the camera out of the belt case and went through the menues and studied all the features. when the announcement was made to prepare for landing I put the camera in the case, raised the tray, and put a magazine in the carry on bag at my feet.To make a long story short, when I got the terminal and was walking toward the luggage area, I happened to discover that i had not zipped up the case. Both zippers for the camera compartment were fully unzipped. If it had not been for the 2&rdquo; still closed, I am certain that the camera would have fallen out at some point while I was gathering together my possessions, retrieving my computer case from the overhead compartment, and making my way with my computer case and carry-on bag to the terminal from the back of the plane.</p>

<h5 id="nice-case-for-canon-g1x-mark-ii">Nice case for Canon G1X Mark II</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needed a nice case/pouch for the Canon G1X mark 2. Camera is already a little larger than many point-n-shoots so I didn&rsquo;t want anything that was too big but still provided decent protection and had space for a spare battery and SD card.This Portland 30 fits it perfectly. Just enough room so that the camera goes in and out easily without being too tight. The small pouch on the front has plenty of space for an extra battery and memory card. I also like that it has zippers instead of velcro like some other pouches have.I have only a minor issue with the little red divider/pocket inside. I just shoved in down into the bottom because I don&rsquo;t really see it being useful. It&rsquo;s out of the way and still there if I ever change my mind.Overall, another good camera accessory by Lowepro.</p>
