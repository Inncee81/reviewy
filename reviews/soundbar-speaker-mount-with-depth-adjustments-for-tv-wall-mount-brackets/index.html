<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>ONE OF A KIND!
. With most Soundbar brackets on the market, the Soundbar will stick out too far in front of the TV or too far behind it. They often hang too low as well. With the Aeon 90200 Soundbar Bracket having a depth and height adjustment, you are able to get the thickest of Soundbars or even the thinnest, perfectly even (flush) with the front edge of the TV. This makes for a much more seamless and sleek look.</p>

<p>BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE!
When you pivot or swivel your TV on it&rsquo;s wall mount, the soundbar pivots and swivels with it. The sound follows the TV. Now wherever you sit you get the best view and the best sound!</p>

<p>DESIGNED TO WORK WITH AEON &amp; OTHER TV WALL MOUNTS
This Soundbar bracket is easy to install and is designed to work with any tv mount but specifically designed to match with these Aeon TV wall mounts:</p>

<p>• <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JVAIEY">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JVAIEY</a>

• <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DR9PWY">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DR9PWY</a></p>

<p>With these AEON mounts the soundbar will install directly to the rails instead of between the TV giving you more flexibility . With other mounts simply install the rails of the soundbar mount between the TV and your TV Mount. It is compatible with virtually every TV wall mount and many TV stands as well.</p>

<p>WORKS WITH NEARLY EVERY SOUNDBAR
Compatible with virtually and Soundbar that has mounting holes on the back. Even the Sonos soundbar which has keyholes. Adjusts for depth, height and width of Soundbar. The two slotted mounting brackets and swivel base insure you can align the holes on your soundbar with this soundbar bracket for a perfect fit every time.</p>

<h5 id="smarter-soundbar-mount-with-depth-adjustment">smarter soundbar mount with depth adjustment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well what took so long for a smart soundbar mount to be made? I initially bought two hockey stick shape metal pieces for my soundbar to mount it to my TV which is on a wall mount. Once I got those sticks on the wall mount, the soundbar sat over 6 inches behind the TV. My TV is not the thinnest flat screen. It looked stupid and I said to myself, why didn&rsquo;t someone think of being able to adjust the depth of the bars to make the soundbar get at least close to the front edge of the TV. I imagine a real thin TV could have the soundbar stick too far in front as well. I came to amazon and found the solution. This mount from Aeon did exactly what I wanted. It not only pushed the soundbar to the front of the TV, I was able to get it perfectly flush with the front of the TV. Now it looks like it should. As if it was a part of the TV. Easy enough to assemble. I did have to take the TV off my wall mount to do it (the hardest part of the install). What Aeon calls it vertical bars, ended up going in between the wall mount and the TV. I used the longer screws that came with my wall mount to go through the wall mount and the soundbar mount into the TV screw holes (glad I kept them). The vertical bars were long too, so no issue getting the soundbar to the right height for my TV, snug against the bottom edge. This is a well thought out design and I only wish I found this sooner. I spent $50 on the hockey sticks and was going to live with that. Since I have had the sticks for too long, I cannot return them. Not sure what to do with them now. Suggestions? I thought about the old table hockey game. Remember that? OK, very pleased with this product, how it works, and how it makes the soundbar look on my TV.</p>

<h5 id="saved-by-extending-arms">Saved by extending arms</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently added stack stone to my fireplace and decided not to put a mantle. It was built so that my tv would be placed into the fireplace wall, which then made me realize that I had no place to put up the center speaker of the surround sound system I had purchased. I looked on Amazon for a mount, only to realize I couldn&rsquo;t use the traditional mounts because how my tv would be set into the wall. Luckily I found the Aeon mounts and they worked perfectly. My tv is inset into the fp, the arms of the mount extend enough so that the center speaker sits right below the tv and it looks great!</p>

<h5 id="this-sound-bar-mount-filled-the-bill-splendidly-the">This sound bar mount filled the bill splendidly. The &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This sound bar mount filled the bill splendidly. The universal mounts from other vendors proved to be not so universal. This Aeon model was the only one that accommodated the 36&rdquo; distance between the holes on my Vizio 45&rdquo; soundbar. Unlike its competitors, it secures to both horizontal members of the TV mount. Its vertical members extend 2&rdquo; beyond the bottom of my Vizio 50&rdquo; TV, which will necessitate a little trimming. Kudos to Aeon for a well-conceived product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sound-bar-mounted-perfectly-now">Sound Bar mounted perfectly now!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These mounts allowed me to perfectly position my sound bar - centered with the TV and flush with the front. Looks great! Comes with a TON of hardware - basically anything you need to mount to the TV itself. I actually mounted these to the frame of my corner mount (about 6&rdquo; behind the actual TV mount) so my sound bar was not impacted by the tilt of the TV (didn&rsquo;t want speakers pointing towards the floor). This was the only mount I could find that allows this flexibility - the articulating arms allow a ton of adjustment.Pros: allows for sound bar to be mounted flush with front of TV - best looking setup, ample hardware includedCons: getting perfectly centered and flush took some time to get perfect</p>

<h5 id="the-only-challenge-the-slots-that-the-sound-bar">The only challenge, the slots that the sound bar &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only challenge , the slots that the sound bar mounted to needed to be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; longer for the sound bar bolts work. Had to elongate the slots with a drill. If i had an option to mount the brackets further apart i would not of had to do that. No fault of the manufacturer. That was the only option due to the tv mount</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="soundbar-mount-with-depth-adjustments">Soundbar Mount with Depth Adjustments</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second soundbar mount I purchased. First one was similar to what another reviewer here had. I think he called them hockey sticks. The speaker considerably hung over the front edge of my TV and did not look very good. Once reading his review and product description, I knew this was the right solution. It went together very easily. Fit my soundbar perfectly. The soundbar now sits below my TV and is flush with the front edge of the TV. Looks perfect together.</p>

<h5 id="needed-ec-engineering-change-to-work-correctly">Needed EC (engineering change) to work correctly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took off one star as these were not easy for one person to install and required a bit of modification on my part. I installed these with the sound bar mounted above the TV. When I was trying to get them on I found the soundbar was slowly sliding down when installed as the instructions said. I finally put a garden hose washer between the long arm and the back of the TV at the point of all 4 screws. The rubber added just enough of a spacer and just enough of a non slip. The screws were too long without the washer. Once I finally got the thing installed and adjusted it works well and keeps the soundbar just far enough away from the TV to eliminate interference. It looks great from the front as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-requires-patience-but-it-s-worth-it">it requires patience, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally got off my butt and mounted the TV on the wall using a really nice AEON assembly, and this AEON soundbar mount. When combined, the two mounts do an incredible job.. but.. you need some patience. Getting everything perfect with this soundbar mounts will take you a couple of attempts. It isn&rsquo;t the most intuitive thing and it requires a good bit of fiddling to get right. Don&rsquo;t try to mount it alone. Get someone to help hold the soundbar in place while you tighten all the bolts down, it&rsquo;ll save you hours of work. Once you have it done, however, it&rsquo;s pretty awesome.</p>
