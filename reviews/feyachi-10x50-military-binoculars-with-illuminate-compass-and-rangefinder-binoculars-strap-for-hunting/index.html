<h5 id="really-ruggedly-made-waterproof-range-scale-and-built-in-heading-readout-clear-glass-what-else-can-you-want">Really ruggedly made, waterproof, range scale, and built in heading readout! Clear glass what else can you want?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought Feyachi products before, rifle scopes, and other shooting equipment so I knew they had good quality stuff, so I needed a good pair of hunting binos, and was willing to give these a try. WOW was I shocked by the quality of these things. Talk about tough, rugged and having some nice features I did not expect.First the rubberized coating is really nice. Every seam is sealed and watertight. The binos are supposed to be waterproof, I have not tested that feature out yet and will update when I do. What I really found nice and did not think I would like it that much was the built in compass that shows heading when looking through the objective! Makes getting your bearing really nice. These are boxed and advertised as Marine Binos but serve really well for hunting and other outdoor activities. The neck strap is wide enough to be comfortable, its not some narrow piece but wide enough not to rub into your neck. Both the eye objectives and large objectives have rubberized covers that attach to the neck strap so you will not loose them.When looking through the objective you can see the compass heading reading, and that even can have a light on it if you want. In addition, there is a gradient scale in the lens that yu can see that will allow you to judge distances pretty darn accurately, I practiced with it a bit and after about 10 minutes could judge distances pretty good, as verified by my LASER Rangefinder. Clear glass is vital in a good pair of binos and these had that.I have to say I am really impressed with the quality and features of these binos! More than I was expecting. I will be using these in the field and will post an update after a few trips to let you know if I still like them. But for now these are great and I highly recommend them!</p>

<h5 id="decent-basic-military-binoculars">Decent basic military binoculars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these on a whim, to get a set of fixed magnification military binoculars. So far these have been working great. The individual focus oculars have enough range on them for me to get them into focus even without my eye glasses, despite my aging eyes and strong eye Rx. Compass bearing is large and easy to read. The ranging/size scale is easy to use once one pays a bit of attention to the instructions on how to use it. The lens covers go back on easily enough with a very positive seal. Overall a decent product that should stand me a lot of good use at the range. I am quite satisfied with my purchase.</p>

<h5 id="every-thing-else-is-good-on-these">every thing else is good on these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No way these are 10 x 50 since i also bought another pair that where 10 x 50 and where very different from these. every thing else is good on these. i like the built in range finder and compass. range finder is the old fashion way with a lot of math and will probably never use them but the compass is a great idea since if you can look at the compass before you drop your glasses for some reason and can easily locate your target again . great for the truck or trailer but will not be carrying these around. kind of big but not by much. can&rsquo;t have everything for the price they sell them at.</p>

<h5 id="the-feyachi-10x50-binoculars-offer-a-terrific-value-the-binoculars-have-a-nice-solid-feel">The Feyachi 10x50 binoculars offer a terrific value. The binoculars have a nice solid feel &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Feyachi 10x50 binoculars offer a terrific value. The binoculars have a nice solid feel to them. The image&ndash;the reason you buy binoculars&ndash;is good quality and extremely clear. I particularly liked the comfort of the neck strap, which is much wider than the norm; it does a good job of distributing the weight. I highly recommend, and at this price, they would be hard to beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="on-a-scale-of-1-to-10-these-are-a-7-as-in-7-power">On a scale of 1 to 10 these are a 7 as in 7 power.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These binoculars are actually 7 power not 10 power. I own a pair and did a comparison to another pair of Tasco 7x50 and 10x50 binoculars I own. When viewing through these binoculars and measuring the exit pupils everything looks identical to the Tasco 7x50 pair I own. These binoculars should be labeled as 7x50 not 10x50. If these binoculars were 10 power then the exit pupils should be 5mm but I measured 7mm and that would make these binoculars 7 power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Binoculars came when promised and are very good quality. I am very happy with them</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-my-second-purchase-for-these-binoculars-they">This is my second purchase for these Binoculars. They &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second purchase for these Binoculars. They are light weight and very clear. I use them for hunting in AZ high country for Deer and Elkand they do not fog up and with the light inside helps for early morning spotting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice but a bit too complicated. Buy one with less bells and whistles,</p>

<h5 id="good-optivs">Good optivs</h5>

<p>Wonderful. Great product</p>

<h5 id="good-clear-view">Good clear view</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good clear view. Range finder not what I expected. Too much manual manipulation. Husband did review it was his new toy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good binoculars. I use them for agricultural purposes and have found them very useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-binoculars-for-the-price">Very good binoculars for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good binoculars for the price. Does what it is suppose to, I have no complains and yes I wouls recommend to a friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="order-but-complete">Order but complete</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not receive my batteries or the cloth to clean the lens looks like it was opened and returned with missing parts. Also no instruction booklet</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">one star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After using these binoculars on maybe 6 or 7 occasions the price that moves the lenses during focus broke completely off.</p>
