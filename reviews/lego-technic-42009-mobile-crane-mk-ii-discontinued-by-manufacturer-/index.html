<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-especially-if-you-can-find-a-deal">Highly Recommended, Especially if you can find a deal.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really a great product, although the price point is a bit high at ~$220. I was able to get mine on sale for ~$170, so shop around!Pros: It&rsquo;s huge, detailed, complex, and fun to play with.Cons: Some of the functions are a bit slow, and it&rsquo;s not quite as robust as I was hoping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-of-the-best-lego-sets-i-ve-built">One of the best LEGO sets I&rsquo;ve built!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this set. It is complex, intricate and something that kept me amazed for hours while building. With most LEGO sets I take away new, interesting building techniques. With this set I continually thought to myself - &ldquo;how in the world did someone think of this??&rdquo; It was a,axing with a ton of nice gear work. I wish there were a lot more set with this much detail and complexity for the adult builder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny">Worth every penny!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth every penny.I&rsquo;ve been building technics since I was 10 years old, and this is the first time I spent over $100 on a set. The sheer size and the engineering behind this set made me feel like 10 again. Actually 10 year old me wouldn&rsquo;t be able to assemble this set. It took me, a 30 year old male good 12 hours to entirely assemble the set. But I was humming and whistling in childish joy for the first 9 hours. Then a fatigue settled in, but I&rsquo;m not the type of person to leave things unfinished because I would be assembling this set in my dreams. I misplaced couple of pieces and had a major set back about twice. But at last, the beast was complete. It really is a beautiful set and worth every penny. If you are technics fan, don&rsquo;t even think about it. Just buy it.Only down side is that the motor is kind of weak. Particularly the ankering function only half way operate via motor. Im pretty sure I assembled everything correctly and give the pieces adequate spaces to make it operate smoothly. There&rsquo;s just too many gears to turn for a small motor. Also it would be a huge blow to my 31 year old self esteem if I couldn&rsquo;t even assemble a Lego that&rsquo;s meant for low teens. But seriously, this set was very time consuming to make.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="oops-there-it-is">Oops, there it is!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This will be one of my favorites. I was unable to get this item from LEGO directly and I was very disappointed. I was looking for something else on Amazon and decided to look for the Mobile Crane on a whim. There it was and the price was not much above the original LEGO price &lt;$20.00. Perfect. I has great engineering - the gear work is a marvel. I also enjoy the second item - the Reach Stacker - a lot of fun to build.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son bought this right when he turned 6. He saved his own money. Some he earned and most he got for kindergarten graduation and birthday when the grandparents found out what he wanted.As with most other Lego sets it is excellent quality and detail! Took my son about 5-6 days working a few hours each day to complete this set. (Yes, mostly on his own with supervision to make sure parts didn&rsquo;t get put backwards, which means total rebuild) He Loves all things Lego! He was so proud when it was finished and showed everybody!! There is a lot to this set as it is very large and has lots of working details. Recommend to all Lego fans!!</p>

<h5 id="so-they-are-going-to-need-to-take-it-apart-a-good-bit-once-again-and-give-it-another-try">So they are going to need to take it apart a good bit once again and give it another try</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My sons have put together loads of Lego sets and they were VERY excited to get this. This one challenged them and they still haven&rsquo;t gotten it together. They&rsquo;ve gotten about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way done and then something isn&rsquo;t lined up right and they can&rsquo;t track down what. Not sure if its a problem with using a wrong piece or something not being pushed together enough that throws off alignment. My husband &amp; I looked at it too for awhile and can&rsquo;t figure it out either which is frustrating. So they are going to need to take it apart a good bit once again and give it another try. We&rsquo;ve put it away for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="incredible-technology">Incredible Technology</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a Christmas gift for my husband. It took him a couple weeks working only a couple hours an evening to get it done. You have to be careful to choose the correct part and position it exactly right. It works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-supremely-cool">It is supremely cool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 14 year old has been a lifelong lego fan. He&rsquo;s at the time in life where he knows he needs to move on. He determined that he would save his money and by what he considered to be the most difficult Lego set ever made. It took him two days to put it together. I will admit that I, his father, have spent at least a couple of hours just playing around with it myself. It is supremely cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lego EXTREME!!! Tons of pieces make this an awesome build for the advanced builder in your house. The outriggers motorize in, out, up, and down.</p>

<h5 id="fair-build">Fair Build</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very cool look, the actual function isn&rsquo;t so great. The motor drives fairly slow and there isn&rsquo;t really any capacity to the crane itself. Fun to build and look at.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE IT!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-a-lot-of-fun-to-build">This was a lot of fun to build</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a lot of fun to build. Took about 2 days. Amazing amount of detail put into this. Everything is motorized but the swing and the wheels.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you want to operate this magnificent crane from your smartphones, all movements independent from a single dashboard?A fully motorized Crane can increase the fun!</p>
