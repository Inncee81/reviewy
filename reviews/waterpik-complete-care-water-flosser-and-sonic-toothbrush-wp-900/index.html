<h5 id="replace-the-battery-yourself">Replace the battery yourself!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this product for about 2 years and have not had any annoying issues with the actual product. The water pick works great and so does the tooth brush. However, after 2 years of use the battery stopped holding a charge. I thought OK, just replace the battery and it will work again. I looked up the owners manual and it clearly states that there is no replacement battery pack available for the toothbrush and that once it stops holding a charge, the whole toothbrush unit must be replaced. However, Waterpik gives clear instructions on how to remove the battery in order to dispose of it properly. WHAT?Being a fairly handy guy I took a quarter and removed the bottom seal and got access to the battery. There is nothing special about the battery pack. It is simply 2 AAA rechargeable cells that are taped together and have little tangs on them that are soldered to wires that connect the battery to the electronics inside the brush. So I unsoldered the wires and took the battery pack to Batteries Plus. I asked them if they can make me a new one, and they said No Problem! The old battery pack was rated at 640 mAh while the new pack is 1600 mAh! This means that I can now take the brush on a weekend trip and have enough battery life in the toothbrush.I paid about 11 bucks for the new battery, brought it home, soldered it to the wires, and I have a perfectly good toothbrush again. Shame on Waterpik for using such a low capacity battery in the first place and not making the battery more easily replaceable.If anyone wants to see how to replace the battery, search for projectgattago on youtube.</p>

<p>No complaints. This was easy to set up and start using. It does take a little while to get used to using the water flosser if you haven&rsquo;t used one before, and honestly, it&rsquo;s easy to get the whole bathroom wet with this thing. The instructions say to &ldquo;just let the water flow freely out of your mouth,&rdquo; but when I try that, some water tends to stream down the handle and onto my hand and then down my arm and often down my leg. Maybe I&rsquo;m not doing it right. In any case, it will get your teeth and gums clean and the brush is excellent, too. The travel case is nice and the battery will last a coupe of weeks. Great for all but the longest trips away from home.For the money, this was a great deal.UPDATE:I just want to add that now that I&rsquo;ve had this a while, I find it almost indispensable. I have noticed now that beyond the routine morning/night use, I find myself constantly using this for a quick but thorough rinse after meals, snacks or coffee. There&rsquo;s no better way for getting pieces of a salad, or nuts or other little items that get easily wedged in your mouth. Just a great, quick cleaning feel.Also, I&rsquo;ve gotten better about not spraying the whole bathroom, You do have a pause button on the handle, but you need to press it firmly to suppress the water flow, otherwise, it will leak.One other note, I&rsquo;ve seen some reviews have mentioned that the reservoir runs out too quickly. I have not noticed that issue at all, for what it&rsquo;s worth.Anyway, great product and I&rsquo;m very glad I bought it.</p>

<p>After many years of manual brushing, I took the chance on one of those rotary pulsating brushes, Oral B to B exact. That was my first venture in powered tooth brushing and not my last. That brush lasted about three years; twelve brush heads and around $120 later, I went into the ultra-sonic field of brushing. Sonicare was the best brush experience I had to date in my middle aged life. That brush too lasted around 3 and even possibly 4 years. Although the replacement brush heads were much more costly than the Oral B ones, and ultamitly the replacement cost of the brush heads is what drove me back to purchase another Oral B rotary type tooth brush.Let me say neither of my first two electronic tooth brushes ever quit, or even slow down. It simply got to the point of replacement heads cost total, matched the total cost of the tooth brush when purchased.Well I went back to the Oral B simply because I could not bring myself to justify the Sonicare price + the brush head price.This time, my Oral B stuck around for 6 months. I simply never felt the same &ldquo;clean&rdquo; feeling on my teeth as I did with the Sonicare.WELCOME WATERPIKNow here is the Waterpik flosser and sonic tooth brush.In short, I have owned this for 3 months and I will never go back to either Oral B or Sonicare. The cost for this unit complete is on par with a mid line Sonicare and the Oral B. However, you also get the water flosser and five floss heads.Top that with the sonic toothbrush, and 2 brush heads, and you have the perfect combo for a healthy mouth.The only thing I can report that may push some away from purchasing this is the sonic brush has two speeds.I feel the low is too slow and the high is a bit too fast. However I also feel it does a fantastic job and in my opinion, beats out Sonicare in the tooth cleaning department.If you have never used a sonic toothbrush, this combo is your chance. Use the low and you are good to go. Then when you are ready, brush on high and you will feel your teeth gleaming.</p>
