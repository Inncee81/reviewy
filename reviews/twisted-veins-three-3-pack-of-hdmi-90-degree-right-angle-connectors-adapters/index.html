<p>Twisted Veins Three Pack of 90° Right Angle Adapters</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: this is a 3 pack of 90° adapters, not 270° adapters. We highly recommend checking the connection on the back of the display before purchasing an adapter. 270° adapters can be purchased separately on Amazon.
Twisted Veins Right Angle Adapters are ideal for close to the wall set ups and to eliminate excessive bending of cables close to the connectors. They can also reduce strain on the HDMI ports of your TV or input devices</p>

<p>Twisted Veins cables are available in 3&rsquo;, 6&rsquo;, 10&rsquo;, 15&rsquo;, and 25&rsquo; lengths. Additionally, Twisted Veins offers a 6&rsquo; cable two pack, a receiver pack consisting of three 3&rsquo; cables and one 10&rsquo; cable, and three packs of right angle adapters. All of these are sold separately at Amazon and can be found by searching for Twisted Veins HDMI.</p>

<p>We recently launched a 4 pack of connectors consisting of two 90° and two 270° and is now available. The convenient connector pack can be found searching on Amazon for ASIN# B014I5CXQQ.</p>

<p>Twisted Veins cables and adapters are triple tested for reliability. Nonetheless, should you ever experience a cable failure, please contact your authorized seller for immediate assistance.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-adapters-great-price-and-they-come-with-free-gifts">Great adapters, great price and they come with free gifts!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received these and was so impressed that I had to jump right onto Amazon to leave this review. Basically, these are what they say they are; 90 degree HDMI adapters. They work as they should. Nothing too exciting about that, BUT! These adapters also come exceedingly well packaged and with a couple &ldquo;extra gifts&rsquo; included. You can tell that someone is trying to make a positive impression upon their costumers and it works. The gifts are a small, key chain flashlight and one of those micro-fiber, screen/glass cleaning cloths. Not the tiny 2 inch by 2 inch cleaning cloth either! A nice big one! So if you need to purchase a 90 degree HDMI adapter, these are definitely the way to go, in my opinion. Consider also that you get three of these for what most other sellers are asking for just one!PS: And don&rsquo;t be like all these other folk who failed to read the listing and then complain when they discover that they needed the 270 degree adapter and not this 90 degree adapter. The listing is very specific. Even warns people of the difference between the two adapters. Yet you still have folk who want to complain because they STILL bought the wrong one and not because there is anything wrong with the adapter.And NO! I did NOT get this product for a free or at a reduced price. I spent my hard earned cash on these adapters because I needed them so you KNOW that my review is fair and unbiased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-advertised-but-buyer-beware">As advertised - but buyer beware!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These connectors do exactly what they are supposed to do, and seem to work without problems. They are about as flat as you could ask for, and they allowed me to use the TV stand in the configuration I wanted.One mistake I made when purchasing these that you want to avoid: HDMI connectors are keyed to go in one direction only, so if you have a tight angle you need to make, be sure that you check to see whether you will only work with a 90 degree or 270 degree connector! One will point in one direction when you plug it in, one will point in the other direction. In some cases, it makes a big difference!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-compatible-with-4k">Not compatible with 4k</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The price on these is good, and they do help with mounting behind the TV, but these are not a good idea for 4k video. I installed two of these (one for HDMI into TV and one for HDMI into wall plug) and the signal degradation was significant. Two caused our xbox to crash constantly on 4k blu-rays. When I removed one, the problem decreased, but didn&rsquo;t go away until I removed both. Probably works fine for standard definition or maybe even HD, but not 4k. I returned these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="suits-my-need">Suits my need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These connectors work just as described. It will come into handy for people who have hdmi devices that are placed near the wall with little clearance and with hdmi ports that stick out horizontally from the device itself. I got myself these connectors as my pc display has the issue as described above- i kept losing signal whenever I jittered my pc desk a bit or when I need to adjust the angle of my display. This could also due to me using a hdmi-to-displayport cable, which might interfere with the signals too.In any case, these connectors definitely reduce the strains on the cable itself by not bending it. Please take note of the angle of the connector too (90 degree or 270 degree) as was emphasized by the manufacturer- you would need to pick the right one that suit your need. There are some reviewers that take STARS away for buying the wrong product themselves.The product package includes three connectors, and FREE stuffs that include three velcro straps for managing cable, one LED light for your keychain, and a piece of microfibre cloth for cleaning your displays if needed.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-happy-customer">Great product, happy customer!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little device! If I had it to do over again, I might have gotten the 270 degree (simply stated, it creates a 90 degree going in the other direction), but I was able to make this one work just fine. Sometimes, depending on your need/situation, it will matter which way the angle faces, so you might want to take a moment to check where you are plugging this in, and study the difference between the 90 and the 270, and make sure you get the one the suites your needs the best.Not only are these high quality little devices, perfect for solving tight spacing issues, but they are a great company to deal with as well!!! Even though this was not a &ldquo;high ticket&rdquo; item, my order still included some useful little complimentary gifts, as a way of thanking me, and rewarding me for my business. This was a total surprise, and made me understand I was dealing with a quality company that cares about customer satisfaction! I highly recommend the product (works perfectly as designed) and the company behind it. I will turn to Twisted Veins for my HDMI cable and accessory needs again for sure!</p>

<h5 id="great-cable-management">great cable management</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the job, great cable management.As an update to this review, I was contacted by Twisted Veins to ask me more about my experience with their product. As a small company their customer service was excellent and they take every review, good or bad, seriously. I gave them a more comprehensive review and now share that with you. This is a very well made product, it does not &ldquo;feel&rdquo; cheap. These adapters hold extremely well, there isn&rsquo;t that wiggle you get from other cheaply made pieces. The packaging is also very nice, when I received them in the mail there wasn&rsquo;t a maraca like shake to them. Very secure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-and-the-seller-included-some-nice-little-items">Works great, and the seller included some nice little items &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, and the seller included some nice little items in the box too. But I should have paid more attention to the direction of these. While they do the job to re-direct my HDMI wires for my older TV that I just mounted to a wall, I should have bought ones that pointed the female jack upward rather than downward. Now I have 2 looped HDMI cables showing under my TV. If they pointed up, my cables would loop behind the TV and be hidden. My mistake though, might order some different ones if the visible cables bother me (or my wife) enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-a-short-while">Great for a short while</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for three months. Now entire pack of three has failed. No picture anymore on one adapeter and keep getting &ldquo;hcdp unauthorized&rdquo; on the other two with Netflix.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Helped clean things up and works as expected. Will buy again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for these new wall mount tv&rsquo;s that have the plug in at that funny angle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly with my TV</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value">Good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does just what it says. Packaged nice. No worries. Good value</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent product and service</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-4">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Presentation on use exceeded expectations</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-5">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-need-it">You need it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is good for all those that have a tv that the conection is impossible when installed on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-no-problems-with-4k-hdr-sigmnals">Works great. No problems with 4K HDR sigmnals.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work great, even with 4K and HDR signals. Cleaned up my installations in two different rooms nicely.</p>
