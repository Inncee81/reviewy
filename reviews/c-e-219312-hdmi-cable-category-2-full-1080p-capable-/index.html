<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Overview:</p>

<p>The HDMI cable is the newest and best digital video connection on the market. HDMI is the only cable that can transfer uncompressed high-definition video and multi channel digital audio in resolutions higher than 1080p. HDMI cables are convenient because they will allow the transfer of digital audio and video in a single cable, permitting a less confusing mess of wires and a cleaner entertainment center. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>

<p>• 1080p Resolution. Audio Return Channel 3D - 3D is the latest rage for both home theater and gaming.</p>

<p>• 4K - The 4K resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 24 Hz.</p>

<p>• Deep Color - The Deep Color feature provides a minimum of 8-bits per color element (24-bits total), providing for a total of over 16 million color variations. x.v.Color - x.v.Color High Definition Audio - HDMI supports a full range of high definition audio types, including SA-CD, DVD-Audio, DTS-HD Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD.</p>

<p>Specifications:</p>

<p>• Our High Speed HDMI cables - with Ethernet have been designed to meet the performance standards. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.</p>

<p>• HDMI Ethernet Channel - The HDMI cable adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.</p>

<p>• Audio Return Channel - The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio &ldquo;&ldquo;upstream&rdquo;&rdquo; from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback. In cases where a TV features an internal content source, such as a built-in tuner or DVD player, the Audio Return Channel allows the TV to send audio data upstream to the A/V receiver via the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for an extra cable.</p>

<p>• 3D Support - The version of the specification defines common 3D formats and resolutions for HDMI-enabled devices, enabling 3D gaming and other 3D video applications.</p>

<p>• 4K Resolution Support - The new specification enables HDMI devices to support extremely high HD resolutions, effectively four times the resolution of a 1080p device. Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect it to come with an extra section on the cord like a PS3 usb cord. Once I saw the cable I was worried if It would even fit behind my TV. Upside down HDMI ports are hard enough as it is to insert a regular HDMI cord with&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t need some extra section on it that&rsquo;s not bendable to make it harder or make the cord useless on my tv. It was a headache getting this cord in&hellip;but it was 2 bucks so I cant complain too much.Update:No signal. Worked once the day it was received (Cable Box) and then I moved it to a device I wouldn&rsquo;t use much (PS3). I go power on the PS3 today and I&rsquo;m getting no signal on this cord. I proceeded to try the cord across all the ports and different devices (Cable box, PS3, DVD Recorder) and still no signal. I tried my other hdmi cables across the ports and those are fine. This cable is crap.Go Twisted Veins for 10 bucks. You get three 3ft braided hdmi cables, one 10ft braided hdmi cable, a right angle hdmi adapter, a cleaning cloth and keylight all for 10 bucks. I wish I would have before.</p>

<h5 id="works-fine-and-i-don-t-intend-to-move-it-around">Works fine and I don&rsquo;t intend to move it around.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert but this cable seems to do just what I wanted. I needed a second HDMI cable to handle 2 up-converting DVD players to the same TV (plenty of HDMI ports on the TV). I had stolen the one since it also had the RCA cables and connected to the new DVD player. When this arrived I connected it to the first and moved the port the other was using (used to HDMI1 for the one device).It works fine. I can&rsquo;t see any resolution difference between the two HDMI ports - both using DVD players.I saw from the reviews that initial tests seem to be fine but problems were reported when it was moved to a different device and then moved back. That implies some weakness in the cables themselves. Since I don&rsquo;t plan on moving the cables around for a LONG time, that&rsquo;s not much of an issue for me.All I can say is I can now use both DVD players in upconverting mode with no difficulty (other than the fact that they both accept the same remote signals &ndash; that&rsquo;s a bit of a pain).</p>

<h5 id="perfect-low-cost-cables">Perfect Low Cost Cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better than pictured since the plastic over the connector isn&rsquo;t at all bulky and there is no blue stripe or branding. 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; of strain relief and hood, 1 <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; to the end of the connector. No ferrites, but prefer it that way for a lighter cable. Wire a bit stiff, but nice and thin at <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; diameter. Ordered two, arrived fast, and both work. Construction seems fine: nothing is loose or bent, and the plugs insert and remove smoothly. Seem perfect for home use. Maybe get more robust ones if you plan to use them in a business conference room being bent and plugged in several times a day. Those $10 or more retail cables are such a ripoff.</p>

<h5 id="product-did-not-match-description-quality-issues-when-used-with-older-laptops">Product did not match description, quality issues when used with older laptops</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 2 months of use, this cable no longer works. This product is clearly bad. DO NOT BUY.Moreover, the one I received did not match description in terms of appearance (I included a photo so you can see for yourself). As you can see, the wire is very thin.I&rsquo;d recommend spending a little extra for a higher quality cable. Without a doubt, this product is junk. Again, do not purchase this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-a-few-if-it-puts-you-at-peace">Buy a few if it puts you at peace</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this set because i was tired of spending 30 dollars on a 6 ft HDMI cable at Best Buy. These were easy to justify because, lets face it, if they end up crapping out on you, you&rsquo;re only out of pocket 3 bucks.In my use, it has been spectacular. I got it so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to keep getting up and fiddling behind the TV when I wanted to go from my Apple TV to my PS4. Now, I am not sure what kind of specs they are most compatible with, but I am sure some older generation hardware may have a few bugs sending a good signal through these cables. But then again, I would have to say its probably more so that the purchaser received a bad cable.Buy one or buy a couple, I have faith that they will work for you the same way they have worked for me. And, again, at 75% of the price you would end up paying in store, they&rsquo;re more than worth the gamble.</p>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK. First things first. This review is for the 6 food Category 2 HDMI cable that sells for $2.95 (at present)Next, I have owned this cable for one day. It just arrived in the mail this afternoon. Therefore, this review is based upon my initial impressions. And the fact that it seems perfectly functional and I have no issues with it so far.So. I ordered this cable to be used with a Philips HD media player because the HDMI cable that I was using was just way too short. I remember paying a lot for that cable and not really wanting to pay a lot for it but not really knowing there was an alternative.Anyway, I needed to move the media player farther away from the TV and obviously, a short cable makes that impossible. I wanted a longer cable but I didn&rsquo;t want to pay a lot because frankly, it&rsquo;s just painful to pay a lot for a cable. Even if I kind of can see where an HDMI cable is quite a bit more complicated than, say, a composite cable. It makes sense to me that it might be more costly to manufacture a perfect HDMI cable. So in a way, I can understand an HDMI cable costing at least $10. But I didn&rsquo;t want to pay that.I had no idea what to expect really. Because $2.95 with free shipping is less than the price of a meal at a fast food joint. But for such a small sum I was willing to take a chance. When the cable arrived, the only thing I really noticed upon inspection was that it&rsquo;s a little bit thinner than more expensive cables. But it&rsquo;s not as thin as I was expecting after reading some of the reviews here. It looks and feels thick enough to handle the job it&rsquo;s made for. If you plug it in and forget it, it should be fine.Obviously, it&rsquo;s nothing fancy. There&rsquo;s no fancy bling on the plugs or the sheathing. The connectors do appear to be gold plated but I&rsquo;m far from an expert in gold plating and I wouldn&rsquo;t know fake gold if I saw it. Nevertheless, it shouldn&rsquo;t really matter. I&rsquo;ve been using cheap RCA cables with no gold plating all my life and the only thing that ever killed them was if the wire inside broke or something. I kind of doubt HDMI is any more demanding on that aspect of things.At any rate, I honestly don&rsquo;t know how they can make a profit selling these at this price. I mean, you can tell by looking at it that it&rsquo;s nothing fancy but it still costs money to manufacture and ship them to the US from China.Finally, the application I bought this for is not that demanding. The media player is technically an HD player but I never play anything more demanding than 720P (My TV won&rsquo;t go above 720P, actually) and the sound and video seems just fine with this cable. I can&rsquo;t see or hear a bit of difference and now I have a cable that&rsquo;s long enough to put the player where I want to.It remains to be seen if this cable will last a while (if it lasts a couple of years it&rsquo;s well worth the couple of dollars). But as I see it at the moment, this is probably one of the best deals I&rsquo;ve ever gotten on Amazon. 5 stars on value alone.</p>
