<h5 id="good-unit-for-under-80-00">Good Unit for under $80.00</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> We didn&rsquo;t want a long cord so had it hardwired for $60. We left on a trip for the PNW where it&rsquo;s all green and lush. We did a lot of night driving. We had a lot of rain both day and night. So - after uploading everything, it all seemed to have blue tint during the day. At night, it&rsquo;s fine. It was easy to set up and operate. When we got home, I emailed the company about the blue tint, asking if there was some setting we missed. I sent a video to show the rep. Right away, she said it was defective. I talked to Amazon and ordered another. I&rsquo;m still waiting on the credit. We installed the new one and the colors are much, much better.In addition to buying the unit, you will need to buy the micro cards. The ones the mfg. suggests are only available on Amazon. The popular brands don&rsquo;t work in this unit. We also bought a suction cup for the window so we could remove it if needed. That is only available from papago for $15.00. To read the micro cards, I had to get a thumb drive - got one at Best Buy for about $10.00</p>

<h5 id="great-compact-720p-dash-cam-updated">Great compact 720P dash cam. Updated!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The PAPAGO GS118-US GoSafe 118 HD Mini Dashcam is an overall great performer in the sub 100 dollar range at 720P.Install is simple and only take a few minutes to run the cord from the 12V adapter (12V to MINI USB) up to right underneath the rear view mirror. We were up and running in about 5 minutes. You can also attach this dash cam to your computer to use as a PC camera or to use as mass storage to access the files without having to remove the Micro SD card. The outside day time footage (attached as video in this review) was excellent (all though at default settings the cam was a tad over saturated in the color) for the sub 100 dollar price point. There are a ton of settings that can be changed and we go over most of those in the video.Supports up to 32GB Micro SD cards for storing files, and also has loop recording built in so that it will overwrite your oldest file. Built in microphone for capturing sound as well. The is an emergency &ldquo;lock button&rdquo; on this model that allows you to lock a current video file so it will not be overwritten during the loop recording. The G-Sensor will also lock an active file if there is a shock to your car (i.e. you hit something or it hits you).There are add-ons you can get, the cam has plugins for GPS (need to buy extra GPS antenna). Which is ok as you can expand this camera at a later time if you would like to.WE give this camera a thumbs up, great work by Papago! they have in the GoSafe 118 and affordable and very compact dash cam!UPDATE!!!We were contacted by Papago and they informed us that the footage should not look this way (over saturated) The video is clear but as we got a defective unit we will keep this at a 4 star review for now.*We did receive this product at a discounted rate for our honest review/opinion. We were not compensated to give a positive review.Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review</p>

<h5 id="papago-gosafe-118-fair-video-quality-impressive-size-and-features">PAPAGO GoSafe 118 - Fair Video Quality, Impressive Size and Features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The PAPAGO GoSafe 118 was recently introduced to replace the previous GS-110 model. After a lot of research on the previous model, I decided on this model as my first dashcam due to the impressive features and small size at an entry-level price. After installing this earlier today, here&rsquo;s my preliminary review of the key features and usability of this dashcam. Note that you must purchase a MicroSD memory card Class 6 or above (8 GB to 32 GB) separately in order to use the dashcam at all.The key advertised features of this dashcam are:Video Resolution of 720p at 30 frames per second, 125° wide viewing angleG-Sensor and Emergency ButtonAutomatic Turn-On2&rdquo; LCD Panel / Compact SizeAdvanced: Stop &amp; Go / Headlight Reminder / Driver Fatigue / Motion DetectionAdvanced with Additional Purchase: GPS Location / SpeedA breakdown of each feature and my thoughts:Video Resolution:Provided with this review is a 30-second clip of the dashcam video performance at the maximum resolution of 720p at 30 frames per second, with the audio removed. The file was recorded in AVI format (not MOV as stated on their website) in a 3 minute clip, amounting to approximately 175 MB with audio. My thoughts on justifying this webcam was that 720p should be sufficient to record any incidents. However, the video quality makes me second guess on whether I should have sprung for 1080p. It is difficult to read license plate numbers unless you are stopped directly behind a car - even those of the vehicles in adjacent lanes are hard to make out. Note that this video has been edited to remove the audio, shorten the clip, and compress into an uploadable format - but I did my best to make sure that did not compromise this review.G-Sensor and Emergency Button:This feature ensures to write-protect a video clip in the event of any excessive vibration. Supposedly, even my installation triggered this, and I was pleased to find the video in a separate folder on the memory card. The emergency button allows one to write-protect the current clip manually. (The dashcam records in 3, 5, or 10 minute clips and overrides the oldest non-write-protected clips once the memory card is full). Because of the super capacitor on-board, the dashcam would be able to save the last video clip in the event of a sudden power loss.Automatic Turn-On:Since the dashcam is plugged into the cigarette lighter 12V port of the vehicle, there was no issue with it turning on and auto recording upon vehicle ignition. Unfortunately, for my vehicle it did not turn off automatically after exiting the car, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can blame this device as I have an electric car which may behave unconventionally.LCD Panel and Compact Size / Installation:The 2&rdquo; LCD Panel is a great size and very clear easy and clear to use. I had originally anticipated for the dashcam to be hidden behind my rearview mirror, but unfortunately this provided an obstructed view given how my car&rsquo;s advanced electronics were implemented. The small size is impressive nevertheless. While the power cord is advertised to be able to be routed through the headliner, beneath your passenger floor mats and into your cigarette lighter 12 volt port, for my vehicle the cable came up a little short but I was able to make it by routing through the glovebox. Also be warned that the provided mount is a non-removable 3M sticker-mount, so be sure to experiment positioning in advance, and clean the glass before applying. The adhesive label can also be a bit difficult to remove.Advanced Features:The Stop &amp; Go feature is great to provide a reminder beep after the car in front of you has moved in stopped traffic (e.g. at a traffic light), helping to avoid honks from those behind you. I did not use the auto headlight reminder as my vehicle automatically determines when to use headlights based on lighting levels, but it seemed to work properly on initial setup. The driver fatigue feature is simply to remind the driver to take a break after a set driving period (e.g. 2 hours), but I also disabled this given my primary use for commuting. Finally, the motion detection can be useful if you have the camera continuously powered and want video of when someone approaches your parked vehicle, but I disabled this (the default) given battery-draining concerns.Additional Purchase Required - GPS Sensor:Finally, there is an optional GPS sensor available for purchase for this dashcam, a feature I did not see available anywhere in this price range. Unfortunately, the sensor costs on the order of thirty bucks, but the ability to record your location and speed can be valuable evidence. I&rsquo;ll be looking into purchasing this add-on when I find it at a decent price, however the flexibility to upgrade is nice nevertheless.Hope this helps. I&rsquo;ll try to update this review if I learn more or change my thoughts after more usage.</p>

<h5 id="papago-118-needs-to-sell-it-with-a-good-memory-card">Papago 118 needs to sell it with a good memory card.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to warn buyers of a problem you may run into. I have tried 3 memory cards that do not work. The camera will shut off, or tell me to install a memory card even if one is in it. Here is what the PAPAGO site reads as of December 17th 2015.copy and paste.We have found that there are some compatibility issues with some brand name SD and MicroSD cards even after you format the card correctly. There are so many SD and Micro SD cards available for purchase that we cannot build a proper list at this time. One brand we noticed that has more issues than most is Sandisk. We hope to build a better list in the near future.I threw away a couple $20 Chineese dash camera&rsquo;s but thought if I bought a name brand PAPAGO it would work. Not yet it doesnt.used a samsung type 2, a tiwian, and Micro HC 32GB. All make the camera shut off after 10 seconds.</p>

<p>I witnessed a minor fender bender while in my car, and I thought, I could give the Papago GS-118 video to the drivers.</p>
