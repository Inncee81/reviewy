<h5 id="ignore-the-naysayers-this-is-the-air-pump-you-ve-been-looking-for">Ignore the naysayers. This is the air pump you&rsquo;ve been looking for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading the hilarious review by 4Jax above, I was ready to buy it just for the humor. After also checking negative reviews about the twist nozzle and the noise I decided to buy it. Here&rsquo;s why:1. Great price, high capacity. It fills inflatables more than TWICE as fast as most other air pumps that are only slightly cheaper (38 cfm vs 14 to 21 cfm). I&rsquo;m impatient and I&rsquo;d rather be playing than blowing up my inflatables. By the way don&rsquo;t be fooled by &ldquo;high pressure&rdquo; ones that claim 460 lpm (liters per minute). 100 liters is 3.5 cubic feet. That works out to 16 cfm, less than HALF what this pump does.2. It has a hose! Others in this price range do not. Even if the twist connector doesn&rsquo;t work and I can&rsquo;t use the hose, it still works great without the hose and IT BLOWS TWICE AS MUCH AIR as competitors. The hose is a bonus.3. If it&rsquo;s loud, so what? I&rsquo;m unlikely to run it near sleeping babies.4. It runs on real wall-plug 110V electricity, the kind that men use, not a wimpy 12V car adapter, or ridiculous rechargeable batteries. Yes, I tried a 12V battery-powered one before I bought this and I can&rsquo;t think of a better exercise in frustration than using one of those little monstrosities that only hold enough charge to blow up a small inflatable or two if you&rsquo;re lucky. When it runs out of charge, you need a CAR to run it off the 12V adapter because the sadist who invented it thought that the wall-plug adapter that goes with it should only be used to charge the battery, not actually run the pump. So rather than inflating it from the comfort of my living room, I have to haul it out to the garage and power it with the 12V adapter with a cord so short it had to have been designed by the same afore-mentioned sadist. Brilliant. If you need to power multiple toys and recharge multiple things from your car (laptops, tablets, video game consoles, etc.) on a long road trip, you should have a proper 110V inverter and an inexpensive multi-plug adapter and extension cord. You can buy a decent 150 watt inverter for around $20. I can haul a bunch of teenagers and recharge all their mobile devices at the same time. Specialized 12V appliances for cars are for people who enjoy pain. Needless to say, the Intex AC Electric pump is run from a house outlet&hellip;or a car outlet if you pony up $20 or so to buy a highly useful power inverter.Sorry for the rant about battery-powered, 12V car appliances, but I hope it will save some poor soul a lot of future frustration.Bottom line: I figured even if a couple things didn&rsquo;t work as nicely as I would hope, it was still more than worth the price, and I bought it.Guess what? When it arrived&ndash;promptly&ndash;it worked flawlessly. I frightened a couple small children (my own) with the prodigious air flow as they stood 10 feet away from me. They fled in panic at the wind and the noise. The noise isn&rsquo;t nearly as bothersome as some people claimed, but my toddler didn&rsquo;t care for it.I immediately tried the twist-lock hose to see if it was as problematic as some people claimed. It worked great. I made sure to line up the notches with the marks on the nozzle so I wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally strip the plastic notches. It is plastic after all, and torquing it heavily will surely break it, which by the way, raises the point of &ldquo;mechanic&rsquo;s feel&rdquo; described by Robert Pirsig in &ldquo;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&rdquo; (chapter 26). A good mechanic can tell by feel when he (or she) is torquing a bolt or joint too tightly. Different materials respond differently. Steel and iron can take a lot of abuse. Aluminum and lead, not so much. Plastic, very little. When you&rsquo;re trying to fit parts together or screw or bolt something and it resists your efforts, stop, take a closer look at the parts and see what may be causing the problem then try it again, gently. Breaking things is no fun.I&rsquo;ve inflated several things with the Intex Quick-Fill AC Electric Air Pump now and have been delighted with how quickly it fills. I can&rsquo;t verify that it puts out 38.9 cubic feet per minute of air, but it fills much faster than any other pumps I have tried, short of an expensive air compressor. I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with the hose, being careful and gentle when I attach it. The hose is incredibly convenient. I was worried about burning out the motor when I filled a large 6-foot-tall habanero sauce display inflatable with a maddeningly small valve, but it worked great. The motor got a little warm&ndash;as it should&ndash;after running constantly for several minutes, but it did the job without any fuss. If I need to take it on the road to inflate a boat for rafting, I have a power inverter in my car&ndash;as everyone should. Excellent product for the price.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a 220V air compressor that puts out a lot of air. However, that 80 gallon beast can&rsquo;t be moved easily and as luck would have it, it&rsquo;s never next to the inflatable beach toys!I&rsquo;ve used Intex products for years and for the price, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find a better value. Intex makes a few different air pumps, but this is their high volume/high output model. It&rsquo;s only a few bucks more than the lesser model. Air pumps of this style are rated by their CFM, or how many Cubic Feet per Minute they put out. The more CFM, the more the volume of air they can move. It&rsquo;s not important to have high pressure as our pool toys and air beds don&rsquo;t need to be blown up to a high pressure.The pump is very easy to use and has several adapters to fit just about any kind of pool toy even if Intex doesn&rsquo;t make it. It can fill Intex products very fast with the large orifice ends that push into place. As an added bonus, simply move the air hose to the side of the unit and it will suck air OUT of your toy! This makes storing them very simple.Is it loud? Sure. But it&rsquo;s no louder than the average vacuum and generally you are outside anyway so who cares. Do yourself a favor and stop using an air compressor or worse yet, blowing these up with your mouth. The screaming kids waiting for their lake toys will thank you for it!I hope you found my review helpful and if so, please click the yes button below. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I read about the loudness being horrific, and ignored it, because with putting out that much CFM&rsquo;s one would expect it to be &ldquo;louder&rdquo;&hellip;.But this was not even louder, it was horrifically NOISY and very intrusive.The first thing I did when I received it was try it out.This pump hurt my ears, and my wife wanted to know why I brought the leaf blower into the house (not really BUT sounded just like it&hellip;HA!)They used a cheap motor in this pump, and that was their down fall of trying to over deliver, but not making sure to build a quality product, for a cheap price.I used a Coleman red pump over the summer, and I will be returning this one and buying the Coleman one!</p>

<h5 id="great-air-pump-for-the-price">Great air pump for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this air pump specifically for my baby pool for my son, and air mattress for guests. 8ts a pain in the a** to blow things up using your mouth or even a hand pump. This arrived just in time for my sons birthday party where we had to use it on his pool. It was easy to unbox and use, and it inflated the pool within a matter of minutes. SO much quicker and easier. It also deflated it quickly as well. It&rsquo;s definitely worth having around to make things easier. Great price, great quality, great brand. I&rsquo;m very pleased with it and highly recommend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good pump. We seem to have the &ldquo;sleep-over&rdquo; house so it gets used frequently, we have no complaints. We have used a few different pumps over the years, all of them are loud and have a high pitch obnoxious sound so I am not sure that can be a legitimate complaint. This pump works quickly and has not gotten hot even blowing up three queen mattresses one after the other👍. We have not needed to use the hose so I can&rsquo;t comment on that.</p>

<p>Fast, efficient, easy, and FITS THE VALVE OF MY AIR BED PERFECTLY! The vacuum cleaner style tube extender is a brilliant advance. Super happy with this purchase!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-air-pump">Excellent air pump</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just started using this so I can&rsquo;t speak to durability, but this blew up my big pool inflatables in just a few minutes each. The unit has a long enough cord that I don&rsquo;t have to stand right on the wall to make it work and the additional hose allows you to reach it around to the inflatables instead of having to move the pump and hold it in place the entire time it is filling.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-but-works-hard">Small but works hard!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, this small, portable air pump works hard! It did a fantastic job and the reverse option really came in handy! I wish the cord was a little longer, but we just used an extension cord and it was fine. Nice handle and very portable - came with every nozzle you&rsquo;d need!</p>
