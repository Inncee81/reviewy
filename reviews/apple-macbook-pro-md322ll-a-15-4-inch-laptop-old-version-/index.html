Product description
The Apple 15.4&rdquo; MacBook Pro is a powerful notebook computer with an innovative aluminum unibody design. It is loaded with advanced power management features and an integrated battery, which work together to provide up to 7 hours of wireless web browsing. You may notice an unfamiliar logo next to one of the ports on the left side of the system. This is Thunderbolt, a high-speed interface that can move data at an amazing 10Gbps, which is double that of USB 3.0. The Thunderbolt port also doubles as a display output because it shares the same physical form factor as a Mini DisplayPort. You can daisy-chain up to six devices, so you&rsquo;ll be able to connect high-speed external storage and an external Apple LED Cinema display via the same port! The computer&rsquo;s 15.4&rdquo; display features LED backlight technology and a glossy finish. Its 1400 x 900 native resolution gives you ample screen space to work with. You&rsquo;ll be able to output to an external display at up to 2560 x 1600 via Thunderbolt. Any Mini DisplayPort-compatible display will plug in without the need of an adapter. If you have a display with DVI, VGA or HDMI input, you&rsquo;ll only need to purchase an adapter cable (i.e., HDMI-to-Mini DisplayPort) for connection. FEATURES: Next-Generation Quad-Core Intel Processor - The 15.4&rdquo; MacBook Pro now features a 2.4GHz Intel Core i7 processor. With 3.6GHz Turbo Boost support and 6MB of cache, this CPU allows the computer to perform up to twice as fast as the previous generation The Graphics Performance You Need, When You Need It - The integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor is now included across the MacBook Pro lineup and handles the things you do every day. It encodes video quickly and makes HD video calls with FaceTime possible. It also decodes efficiently so you get long playback time for DVDs and iTunes movi</p>

<h5 id="great-computer-at-a-great-price">Great computer at a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this as a Christmas gift for my son, he absolutely LOVES it!! Shipping was the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen, the MacBook was beyond protected with amazing packing! Customer service was awesome. I had a quick question, they told me what to do and bam its perfect. My son is a huge fan of youtube and Minecraft, both of which he said are perfect. He&rsquo;s an Apple boy so he loves the way it maneuvers and all the options it has! Great computer! :)</p>

<h5 id="once-you-go-mac-you-never-go-back">Once you go MAC you never go back!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first Mac book. I love it. The battery life is great, starts up quick, shuts down fast, the screen is sharp, the sound quality is really good, and I am sold on the aluminum body.The reason I switched to Apple is because I owned a Iphone for a few years, and one day i realized that i can use my phone better than i can use a windows computer. I thought to myself that if Apple can make a phone this good, imagine how good their laptop computers must be. Sure enough i ordered one, and had no regrets.I was in the military then, and deployed to Afghanistan, I took my Macbook with me. It survived the harsh environment. A lot of my friends who owned Windows laptops were having issues off and on, or their laptops just stopped working. My Mac book Pro has not skipped a beat. This computer is one of the best investments i ever made.Cons: My computer gets pretty hot sometimes, and the fan can get loud.I would still recommend this computer to friends and family.</p>

<h5 id="15-macbook-pro-is-a-keeper">15&rdquo; MacBook Pro is a keeper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of MacBooks(6+) and this is the one I&rsquo;ve decided to keep. I swapped the HD for a Samsung 830 SSD and everything loads so fast, it&rsquo;s like using an iPad or iPhone. The resolution is a little low, but colors are vibrant and the workspace is acceptable for writing and webpage viewing. The speakers sound great for such a thin laptop, with vibrant warm sound. The video card (AMD 6750m) lets you play games such as Diablo 3 at native resolution and high details, while the integrated graphics(Intel HD 3000) handle office work with ease and increase battery life and decrease heat versus the AMD card. I usually see 5+ hours web browsing, and I know I could see more than that by turning down the keyboard backlight and display brightness. The trackpad gestures make scrolling and backtracking through content easy, as well as allowing better window management than Windows(imagine that!).I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a powerful everyday notebook, that&rsquo;s light enough to carry everyday, but without Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows annoyances(popup alerts, scamware, antivirus updates).</p>

<h5 id="great-product-with-just-a-couple-minor-gripes">great product with just a couple minor gripes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>overall im loving this macbook pro so far. i even did my first school project on it (im in an adult high school program at my local community college) and found the ability to have multiple home screens (such as with linux) a great help, and the fact that mac&rsquo;s have the added benefit of being able to run virtually any software a school would require is great.ive tried the computer out for wow and beathazard already and found the performance astounding for the specs (namely graphics card) of the machine. my only gripes would be the trackpads built in mouse (ive already ordered, from amazon, the logitech bluetooth mouse that is listed on apples website) and the graphics card, as well as the screen resolution. for $2000 i would have expected 1080p resolution (though i did know before hand that its only 1440x900&hellip;but still) and at least a 6950 graphics card (lets be honest&hellip;a 6770 is the ultimate budget card and 2000 dollars is a lot of money).for an overall impression im extremely impressed with this product, and it is also my very first apple product ever owned, so im still super excited. i have noticed the battery drains rather quickly even with the screen and keyboard backlights dimmed without running itunes or anything really except for firefox to write this review&hellip;im not sure what i can do in order to up the battery life or if its just like that (though its supposed to get 7 hours of battery while browsing the web, no games included&hellip;hmm ill be calling the apple store tomorrow about this.)ANYWAY! thanks for reading and i hope this has helped out immensely, thanks for your time and i highly recommend this product or a higher level of it! :)</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-machine-shame-about-the-hard-drive-and-battery-life">Fantastic machine, shame about the hard drive and battery life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The macbook pro is almost everything I hoped for. Great design quality and screen. Very comfortable keyboard, and OS X mostly just works. There are a few annoyances though:1. The fan kicks in and is very loud under relatively little load. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be unique to my laptop, my coworkers who own the same model report the same issue. Unfortunately, it is so loud it can be heard when talking to someone on the phone by the person at the other end.2. The battery life is terrible. 2-3 hours max. Again, not unique to my laptop. It&rsquo;s more of a portable desktop than something that can be used unplugged.3. The hard drive performance is terrible. IU don&rsquo;t recall my intel mac mini being dog slow. As my macbook has 16GB RAM and there was nothing else running this is disk related. After about 6 months of frustration at an awesome machine being crippled by the disk I upgraded to a WD Scorpion Black a couple of days ago. Night and day difference.I&rsquo;d certainly buy another macbook pro, it&rsquo;s a great machine.</p>
