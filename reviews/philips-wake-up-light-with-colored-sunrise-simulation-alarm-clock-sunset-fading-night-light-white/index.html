<h5 id="no-full-dim-feature">No Full Dim Feature</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This may seem like a nit pick but -For those of us that strive to have as dark a room as possible, the controls should have a zero light setting. This is a fundamental for deep sleep. Philips really tried with this light. But remember, waking up is only part of the full sleep cycle. We spend more of our time in the deep sleep phase.Having even a low light in your face all night is not acceptable.Stealth mode please.</p>

<h5 id="a-few-differences-from-what-i-read-about-this-product-see-photos">A Few Differences From What I Read About This Product&hellip;&hellip; See Photos~</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since this product has already been reviewed over sixteen hundred times and some quite thoroughly (thank you!), I&rsquo;ll keep this review short (for me). This has been one of our favorite purchases we own here from Amazon!I&rsquo;ll mention a few things that I think vary from what I remember reading (and I read a TON or reviews, lol) and am uploading some photos so you can get a closer look and see what I mean&hellip;First, I read some frustrations about not being able to set the time or alarms without accessing the buttons from above. I&rsquo;m able to set the time and alarm times via the touch buttons on the front, below the time (see photo where buttons are lit). You can also use the upper buttons but don&rsquo;t have to for everything. The only thing you have to use the upper buttons for (in relation to setting alarms) is to turn an alarm off or on. For us, this isn&rsquo;t a daily event since we usually get up at the same times so no big deal.Second, I was under the impression from the reviews that this thing would be kind of huge but I guess that depends on what you consider large, lol. I posted a photo with it next to some small alarm clocks and a bill to give you an idea of it&rsquo;s size. For us, it replaces both an alarm clock and a lamp on a nightstand so it&rsquo;s not too large.Other than that, my wishes are few. I wish it included AM radio and didn&rsquo;t remember reading that it didn&rsquo;t (but I wasn&rsquo;t likely thinking I&rsquo;d miss it). Sometimes I miss a little talk radio but other technology obviously suffices.Like others mention, the buttons above are out of sight from the front. Call me crazy, lol, I used a Sharpie to mark lines where the buttons are. (There&rsquo;s no reason for my using different colors except that I added the red lines later and that&rsquo;s what I had handy.) Feeling around for the buttons when you want to turn the light or radio on, off, up or down, is just annoying. When I finally buy a yellow or orange Sharpie it&rsquo;ll look more like sun rays, haha&hellip; And rubbing alcohol rubs it right off anyway. The last two photos show all of the upper buttons, all the way around.Lastly, the snooze sensitivity is too high for my preference. If I set down a cup of coffee near it, during the alarm time, it snoozes the radio off. I could change the settings for no snooze but I like waking up to radio and having the option of touching it for more quiet time. If I softly close a drawer below it, same thing, it snoozes.I&rsquo;m generally not this generous with 5 star ratings but overall I think the good heavily outweighs the bad and I definitely love this product. We&rsquo;ve had ours for 5 months without problems but I&rsquo;ll update this review if anything changes. We live in the grey Seattle area and the sunshine this thing brings us makes it the best alarm we&rsquo;ve owned. Smile. Buy with confidence. Hope this is helpful!</p>

<h5 id="great-idea-terrible-execution">Great Idea &ndash; Terrible Execution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Usability clearly wasn&rsquo;t kept in mind by the people who designed this.First off, what I like about it:It does exactly what&rsquo;s advertised. It not only wakes you up by slowly ramping up the brightness while changing colors, it does a cool sunset as well. I love that.It&rsquo;s downhill from there.First, this is a clock radio. So for some reason they made it round. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I&rsquo;m first waking up, being careful not to knock over the round, unstable, clock isn&rsquo;t exactly the easiest thing. It <em>will</em> fall over if you use it.It has a mixture of buttons around the edges and a touch screen on the front. The buttons are absurd. Try finding a specific button with a bright light blasting in your eyes. Eyes that have just woken up. Yeah.It has two alarms. Great. But it doesn&rsquo;t know what day of the week it is, so you have to manually set them when the weekend comes around. And don&rsquo;t forget to switch back come Monday!I have a 7 year-old clock radio that not only does this better, it even knows when to switch to DST.Which leads to the real &ldquo;what on earth were they thinking?!?&rdquo; moment:If the power goes out, there&rsquo;s no battery backup.This is 2017, guys. A gimmick does not make a good alarm clock by itself. First, it needs to have the basics covered. Usability is paramount!I would recommend turning this into a cube with physical buttons on top that are easy to find, even with your eyes closed. Automatic time setting. Automatic knowledge of the day of the week and when DST begins and ends. This is the bare minimum for the $100+ range. My alarm clock that I bought from Target in 2009 has these, and it was about $50.I&rsquo;m returning this before I knock it off the night stand. It&rsquo;s incredibly unstable.</p>

<p>I bought this after eying it for a few months. I was originally going to buy the low end model, but I cancelled that order after the product was continually out of stock and they kept pushing back my expected delivery date.I&rsquo;m really glad I got this model- I love the sunrise simulation, and it seems to be brighter (in lumens) than the low end- the top brightness is perfect for me.I bought it in order to start getting myself to go to the gym at 5:30 every morning. I had tried with my regular alarm, but just couldn&rsquo;t do it. I spent the first few days with this alarm gradually waking up earlier (which I had tried with my regular alarm to no avail), and finally started getting up at 5:30. I wake up so much easier- no snoozing, and no laying in bed trying to convince myself to get up. I have the simulation set at 40 minutes before my alarm, and I&rsquo;m usually aware of the light about halfway in, and spend the last 20 minutes slowly waking up, before being alert and ready to go by the time the actual alarm goes off. This method of waking up has seriously changed my life- I basically have two extra hours in the day, and I&rsquo;ve noticed a definite change in my mood throughout the morning, even on days when I don&rsquo;t exercise (so the mood shift isn&rsquo;t necessarily due to the exercise).I also really like the sunset simulation. I set it to 20 minutes, and read for about 10 minutes before the light is too dim. The progression always makes me feel sleepy, even if I was wide awake before I set it.Long story short- I&rsquo;ve gotten some of the best sleep of my life since I bought this, and have been able to change my morning routine! Definitely worth the cost.</p>

<p>I just got this and have used it two mornings in a row. The simulated sunrise makes it so much easier to wake up when it&rsquo;s still dark outside!</p>

<p>I love this clock. I wake up feeling rested and happy. With a typical alarm clock, I usually have to set multiple alarms and I&rsquo;m in a bad mood being yanked out of a deep sleep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>love it! It works great to wake me up. Regular alarms don&rsquo;t work,I just turn them off. This alarm slowly lights up like the sunrise and then has birds start chirping.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-winters">Good for winters</h5>

<p>Good for winters, where the sun doesn&rsquo;t come up until after I normally wake up and/or it&rsquo;s overcast a lot here. For the summertime it doesn&rsquo;t really do much.</p>

<p>This product works! But as a functional alarm clock, the ergonomics needs to be reworked. The buttons are placed along the circumference of the clock.</p>
