<h5 id="good-entry-level-a-v-receiver-with-a-serious-4k-hdcp-2-2-hdmi-limitation">Good entry level A/V receiver with a serious 4K HDCP 2.2 HDMI limitation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Yamaha RX-V379BL 5.1-Channel A/V Receiver is a classic example of the, seemingly, eternal Yamaha A/V receiver line that exemplifies &ldquo;slow and steady wins the race&rdquo;. There is very little difference in basic features and the classic Yamaha DSP sound field program between a Yamaha A/V receiver of twenty years ago and one of today other than the slow evolution of input modes, the addition of new connection standards, like HDMI, and the slow and steady sunsetting of legacy inputs like component and s-video and so forth.Recent Yamaha receivers have included HDMI switching. But, with the arrival of 4K UHD video HDMI inputs must now have HDCP 2.2 pass through and compatibility. The big difference between the Yamaha RX-V379BL 5.1-Channel A/V Receiver and the previous Yamaha RX-V377 model, that also claimed to support 4K video, is that the HDMI inputs on the Yamaha RX-V379BL are advertised as being HDCP 2.2 compliant. Unfortunately, despite this being said over and over in Yamaha advertising in a way that suggests that all four HDMI inputs on the receiver are 2.2 compatible, this just isn&rsquo;t true. In fact, only ONE HDMI INPUT on the Yamaha RX-V379BL 5.1-Channel A/V Receiver is HDCP 2.2 compatible. The other three are not.This guarantees that even though you may be able to connect one 4K UHD HDCP 2.2 source that you may currently have that as more and more 4K devices come to market that you will be completely out of compatible HDCP 2.2 inputs. For example I have both a ROKU 4 that does 4K streaming and upscaling and a Panasonic Blu-Ray player that does 4K upscaling. Can I use both devices in their 4K output modes with the Yamaha RX-V379BL? No. Neither device will output if any component in the connection chain between the device and the TV is not HDCP 2.2 compliant. Only one HDCP 2.2 input on the Yamaha RX-V379BL? Too bad. One of the devices will have to output 1080P. Shame on Yamaha for not being more up front about this, and clearly stating that the receiver in fact has only one 2.2 compatible input.Although Yamaha offers more 2.2 compatible HDMI inputs on its higher priced receivers, even upgrading several models higher won&rsquo;t get you a receiver with all HDCP 2.2 HDMI inputs. Yamaha is obviously wanting to up-sell buyers with this stingy attitude, but it&rsquo;s not gong to work for long. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before A/V receivers from most brands will offer 2.2 compatibility for all HDMI inputs all the time. The Denon AVR-S510BT, for example, a very feature similar unit at the same price point, has five HDMI inputs, three of which are HDCP 2.2 compliant. The Denon unit also has a USB input on the front panel, a feature that the Yamaha RX-V379 lacks. The cost of making all the inputs HDCP 2.2 compliant could not be more than pennies per unit on the scale that Yamaha operates, OK maybe a dollar. The only reason for Yamaha to be so parsimonious with the feature is to up-sell buyers into more costly units.Yamaha is a great brand but their design side seems perpetually cheap and tight fisted when it comes to adding features. One other example is Bluetooth. This receiver has Bluetooth, yes? Well, yes, for playback. But for pairing and using Bluetooth headphones, a headphone type that most users are far more likely to have these days than a wired headphone with an RCA phono plug? No, sorry. Hasn&rsquo;t occurred to Yamaha that this is necessary. Please plug your wired headphones into the full size headphone jack on the front panel.The Yamaha RX-V379BL is a great entry level receiver, with all the many virtues that have made Yamaha a standard go to choice for home theater for what seems like forever. But it&rsquo;s sure to be replaced in a short while as you acquire other 4K HDCP 2.2 devices, or create frustration if it isn&rsquo;t replaced, and of course as newer Yamaha models that really do have complete all input 4K UHD HDCP 2.2 compatibility come to market. The Yamaha RX-V379BL 5.1-Channel A/V Receiver is OK, for now. But you should probably wait for the next Yamaha iteration with all four or more HDMI inputs having HDCP 2.2 compatibility.UPDATE: Just as I expected and predicted, the Yamaha RX-V379 has now been replaced by a newer model, the Yamaha RX-V381, that features FOUR ALL HDCP 2.2 compliant HDMI inputs. Glad to see that Yamaha finally figured out that their strategy for HDCP 2.2 inputs on the RX-V379 was just dumb and counter productive.</p>

<h5 id="limited-features-but-exactly-what-i-need">Limited features but exactly what I need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received this unit, so this is a preliminary review. I&rsquo;ll update it as I get to use it more and as 4K60p content comes available. First and foremost make sure and check out the features of this and its big brothers. It&rsquo;s very feature limited, but for my situation, this receiver is perfect. I don&rsquo;t need software streaming. I don&rsquo;t need wifi. I have those in spades on my other devices. I don&rsquo;t need multiple zones. My wife won&rsquo;t even let me mount surround speakers, so I don&rsquo;t need a 7.2. But what I did need was a receiver that can handle the forthcoming 4K bluray players (and their HDCP 2.2 spec) and have a good quality sound for my setup, which it does. As of right now, I am very happy, and as time goes on, I&rsquo;ll continue to post my thoughts.Small update 5-31-15: Still loving this receiver. I switched to a TV with (4k) Netflix built in and getting the TV Out/HDMI ARC working was far easier than my previous two receivers. My only gripe so far would be that the center channel wire inputs on the back are the lower-end pull tab style. So make sure and check a picture of the back of the unit and confirm it meets your wiring needs.Small update 9-7-15: This received still performs perfectly for what I use it for. Sound is great. Features, while basic, work great and are easy to navigate. I&rsquo;m very happy. Next update will be after UHD BD players and content arrive to see how the passthrough works.</p>

<h5 id="good-receiver-with-exception-of-hdmi-issues-with-roqu-and-direct-tv-for-4k">Good receiver with exception of hdmi issues with roqu and Direct tv for 4k.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My brother recommend this reciever and it has great sound. I have a 4k tv with Direct and a blueray player and a Roqu. I tried setup and left it in charge of Hdmi. I had to call tech support and found that the 4k hdmi was on 4 hdmi. Then the roqu would come on as it always stays on but after pushing that hdmi it automatically went to Direct tv. I finally ordered an optical cable and use the tv only for hdmi and go to the receiver via optical for sound. Now nothing comes out of reciever via. Hdmi and all works fine. I do recommend the Yamaha speaker system.</p>

<h5 id="an-affordable-receiver-for-an-hdmi-world">An affordable receiver for an HDMI world</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this receiver primarily to get multiple HDMI inputs. For years I used two Harman Kardon receivers for my two home audio/video rigs. They had only one HDMI input so each had an external splitter and a tangle of cables to go with it. The HK remotes were also very confusing. I initially ordered a cheaper Yamaha receiver with fewer features by mistake but Amazon&rsquo;s return policy let me send it back for a full (and fast) refund. This one had all the connections that I wanted and was very easy to set up - though it did consume about an hour and a half. Now I have two Yamaha receivers that produce great sound with remotes that even my wife has mastered.</p>

<h5 id="impressive-sound-scared-the-wife-with-surround-sound">Impressive sound, scared the wife with surround sound.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this receiver to replace my outdated 10 year Panasonic receiver. I needed to update to HDMI and digital sound connectors and found this one. The entire family enjoys the surround sound home theater experience. Great buy. I knew I did good when my wife looked around in surprise during a movie. So now&hellip;.Lifetime movies in surround sound&hellip;unintended consequences.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-upgrade-from-vacuum-tube">Fantastic upgrade from Vacuum tube</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great performance for the money.I purchased this to replace my all in one surround sound unit.I&rsquo;ve been using it for a solid 6 months now and it performs great. I&rsquo;m happy to finally get all my devices channeled through one receiver without splitters, adapters and switch boxes to manage them all. I have my TV, FireTV, Blueray, PC and Playstation all routing through this and they all work wonderfully.I was additionally surprised when the connected device names where automatically displayed on the LED when I switched to them. I guess it&rsquo;s been a while since I last purchased a receiver. My last receiver was vacuum tube haha.</p>
