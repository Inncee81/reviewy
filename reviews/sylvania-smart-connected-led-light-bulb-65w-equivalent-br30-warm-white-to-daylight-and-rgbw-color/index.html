<h5 id="these-lights-work-great-the-color-control-helped-me-match-the-other">These lights work great. The color control helped me match the other &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These lights work great. The color control helped me match the other halogen lights in the room and made them blend in perfectly. One complaint, and it&rsquo;s a big one. These lights have RGB, are compatible with Amazon Echo and work with my Smartthings hub. However, they can only be controlled by the phone app for color control. You can&rsquo;t tell the echo to change the color. Also, the lights are individual devices, so even though I can group them for basic functions like on off and dimming level, I have to go into the app to manually change each light&rsquo;s color. This is a pain in the ass, and I wish the software would be written to all color control of the lights from the echo. Even if it is a IFTTT or a group command setting would be better than having to use your hands.</p>

<h5 id="smart-bulb">Smart Bulb</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had these bulbs (2) only a short time but I&rsquo;m very pleased with them so far - I will update later as necessary. I use these in recessed sockets over two chairs in a living room. For those using Samsung&rsquo;s SmartThings hub, a word of &ldquo;relief&rdquo; for any that have had frustration with the (poorly rated, 2.6) Sylvania &lsquo;Lightify&rsquo; app - DON&rsquo;T USE THE APP! Pair the bulb as you would any other SmartThings device and a controller application will show within the SmartThings app. It provides a full range of intensity, and all colors are controllable. Don&rsquo;t get caught in the &lsquo;loop&rsquo; of trying to &ldquo;create a Lightify account&rdquo; as the instructions insist. The instructions are for pairing with the Sylvania Gateway device.The bulbs both paired easily with the (Samsung) hub - initiate the &lsquo;new device&rsquo; and then turn on the power to the bulb(s). When &lsquo;found&rsquo; you can name the device or leave the Sylvania nomenclature as it is. Creating scripts for the bulb is as easy as any other of the Samsung devices and done the same way e.g. on at sundown off at 11:15 p.m. The bulbs will resume at whatever setting of intensity and color that they were set when turned off.Not surprisingly, the range of color goes from the sublime to the ridiculous with the extremes of the color range being&hellip;well extreme. Not to complain though, the range of color is so broad that there will be something for everyone.A note from the SmartThings Support page: &ldquo;Note: OSRAM LIGHTIFY bulbs have a known firmware issue that can occasionally cause them to fail as ZigBee repeaters. This can potentially cause other ZigBee devices to fail to update and/or respond.&rdquo; My opinion follows - this is a &lsquo;potential&rsquo; issue only if you must depend on the bulbs as RF range extenders.<strong><em>edit added 1/30/17</em></strong>From the latest Samsung Smart Things Hub OTA update notice: &ldquo;This update &hellip; adds capability to provide over-the-air firmware updates to Osram and Hue bulbs.&rdquo; My Opinion follows - Samsung is adding a path for Sylvania to update its bulb firmware.</p>

<h5 id="decent-smart-lights-but-they-stay-on">Decent Smart Lights but They Stay On.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have five of these in my kitchen, they are just as bright as the original can lights I had. They have a good range of brightness and from warm to cool coloring (ranging from light orange to white to light blue and anywhere in between) though they do not have any other colors. They were easy to set up and pair with my wink hub through my Alexa Dots and Echo along with the apps.My biggest complaint with these is that unless you turn off the wall switch the lights never turn off. It&rsquo;s a very low glow and not that noticeable but it&rsquo;s still on. I have contacted Wink and they say to contact Sylvania. I contacted Sylvania and they say that&rsquo;s just how the lights are. It&rsquo;s a waste of energy (though it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much). I can&rsquo;t see any reason for this because it&rsquo;s not even bright enough to be used for a night light. I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any other lights like these so they will just have to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="color-consistency-could-be-an-issue-but-works-with-wink-hub-and-alexa">Color Consistency could be an issue but works with Wink Hub and Alexa</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought four of these bulbs and have them over my mantle. All bulbs are on the same setting and one has color that is quite off from the other three. So I&rsquo;d have to question the consistency of this product. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s working with my Wink Hub and Alexa just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightbulbs-with-a-mind-of-its-own">Lightbulbs with a mind of its own</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to start the automation process of some of the lights in the house. After some research, I started to get bulbs. These are okay.I don&rsquo;t know if there is something wrong with the bulbs I received (but I bought some from both Amazon and the local hardware store), but they have some annoying issues. The problem is random and unpredictable, but they are problems. I don&rsquo;t think it has anything to do with defective bulbs. Here is what I noticed:1. Sometimes the bulb doesn&rsquo;t turn on and you have to use the physical light switch to turn it off, and then turn it back on, and use the app or Alexa to turn the light on.2. Sometimes the bulb comes on randomly - This may be attributed to a lack of RF or Power Spike filters in the bulb itself. Sometimes in the day or in the middle of the night, it just comes on. I can easily turn it off using the app or Alexa, but it&rsquo;s annoying when you&rsquo;re sleeping.3. You can&rsquo;t adjust the color of the bulb (the white range of the bulb) unless you have a Lightify Gateway, and their app to do that. (I use Samsung Smartthings so I have no option to change the white range of the bulb.)Those are the common issues I see on occasion (maybe once or twice a week on a random bulb &ndash; I have several of these.)When it works, it is great! It handles IFTTT so I can program them to turn on or off for any reason, and it is very convenient to not have to come home to a dark home when I go out and didn&rsquo;t turn on the lights.If you don&rsquo;t mind the minor annoyances, it&rsquo;s a good product.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-white-light-adjustment">Perfect White light adjustment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Integrates right into the Wink Hub + Amazon Echo ecosystem I have in my Apt.Perfect White light adjustment, 3000K is spot on according to my colormeter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-the-bulb-works-well-and-has-good-color-and-brightness">But the bulb works well and has good color and brightness</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works with Alexa. It&rsquo;s not instant - usually turns on within 1-2 seconds when using Alexa. Using a light switch there is a slight lag when compared to normal light bulbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-smart-bulb-for-the-price">Great Smart Bulb for the Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After deciding against going with Z-Wave switches in the master bath, we decided we would get some Zigbee connected light bulbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="light-up-more-spaces-than-regular-bulb">Light up more spaces than regular bulb</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome light! I love it!! My husband love it! I replaced my old patio bulb with the Sylvania Lightify flood bulb and it light up more spaces than my old patio bulb.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-lights-app-needs-some-work-though">Good lights, app needs some work though.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own and do use both these and the Philips Hue bulbs. I&rsquo;ll say each have their Pro&rsquo;s and Con&rsquo;s, but overall these are great lights (especially since it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;all in one&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exponentially-better-than-the-bulbs-they-replaced">Exponentially better than the bulbs they replaced</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Placed 4 of these in my home theater as replacements for the existing standard LED bulbs in my 5 inch can lights. Exponentially better than the bulbs they replaced.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great with Smartthings and Echo</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality and response.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="replacement">Replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy set up and connected to my Wink up the first time. Replaced TP-Link because it&rsquo;s not compatible with Wink.</p>

<h5 id="the-app-or-the-lights-are-screwed-up-now">the app or the lights are screwed up - now &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the app or the lights are screwed up - now neither light works and have reset the system 4 times - only work as white light</p>
