<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="well-designed-sci-fi-with-some-nice-new-twists">Well designed sci-fi with some nice new twists.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are so many reviews out there for Prey compareing it to other games or questioneing what it has in common with Prey (original) or the dropped Prey 2. All of those reviews are missing the point. This game Prey 2017 is its own game and it&rsquo;s great, and different from the rest of the FPS games out there.The story is interesting and keeps you engaged well enough, but it&rsquo;s the environment and gameplay that shines. From choosing how you&rsquo;d like to progress and upgrade your character to how you&rsquo;d like to approach situations. Would you like to play it safe and sneak past everything, take everything head on, or make yourself more alien than human and fit in. Or become anything in the environment through mimic abilities.The combat isn&rsquo;t as polished or quick as a FPS shooter, but this fits since your not a marine, or spec-ops trained fighter, your a random person who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. You won&rsquo;t survive purely on shooting through every enemy, nor will you beat this game without thinking carefully on how you&rsquo;ll approach some of the trickier situations.There&rsquo;s many new and creative implementations in terms of gameplay and story wise here. Well worth playing for anyone looking for an out of the box unique game. If you want a non stop action FPS, Doom is what you are looking for, Prey is a must play for fans of thoughtful SiFi.</p>

<h5 id="enjoyable-despite-some-major-flaws">Enjoyable Despite Some Major Flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bethesda really should have dropped the &ldquo;Prey&rdquo; name when they decided not to make a sequel to the original &ldquo;Prey&rdquo; but a completely different game with almost nothing at all in common.If I had to oversimplify it, this game is basically Dishonored meets Half-Life with a little Resident Evil. It&rsquo;s an FPS set in a dystopian future that oozes atmosphere. A progression system lets you acquire and improve abilities, eventually leading to some very dark and macabre powers. Ammunition and supplies are never in abundance, and the enemies are very tough even on the lowest difficulty levels.This game is tough. I completed it in about 25 hours - starting with higher difficulty and lowering as things began to feel increasingly impossible. I often found myself almost completely depleting my ammo and healing supplies just to down a single enemy. The stealth elements work fairly well, but don&rsquo;t seem to apply to some of the more aggressive baddies. I spent most of the game wandering around with half health and got very familiar with the reload screen (in other words I died a LOT) and never ever got the sense that I was becoming more powerful than the things that were hunting me. You can save anywhere which is a big plus for a game this difficult. There are frequently multiple paths for a given objective with consequences commensurate with each.Story wise, the game weaves a good bit of suspense and mystery. As it started the story was my least favorite part, but by the end it was my only reason for going on. The gameplay became almost painful as the enemies got progressively more capable and plentiful while, despite completing several of the ability trees my character did not become stronger in proportion. This game is almost impossible to complete through brute force - and that&rsquo;s usually a good thing because it forces you to think around the problem, but in this case thinking around the problem became clunky and cumbersome. For example, there are certain enemies placed in your path with no way around which can only be hurt when they are disrupted in some way - either with an EMP, or Psychic damping. This means you have to use specific weapons on them such as EMP grenades. The problem is that grenades occupy your weapon slot so you have to switch between the grenade and the weapon you want to use on the enemy. When the process of switching weapons takes nearly a full second, and the effect of the EMP only lasts for 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> seconds, you can only get a couple of shots off before the enemy recovers and you have to start the sequence over again. This is just one example of many where something that should have been brain candy ended up being tedious and annoying.Despite all this, the final story sequence in the game goes a long way to justifying the slog through its latter half. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll say so I don&rsquo;t spoil anything.</p>

<h5 id="fresh-and-exciting-but-with-some-flaws">Fresh and Exciting but With Some Flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty solid game. It is defiantly worth a play through. The opening and beginning of the game is fresh, exciting, and awesome. The game does get a little repetitive and frustratingly difficult near the end. I found myself running out of ammo and getting killed a lot near the end, and I am an experienced gamer. While I do like some difficulty in my game, it broached the cusp of frustrating.This game was sold as a horror sci-fi game and while it lived up to the sci-fi portion the horror element was severely lacking. The game designers did a great job of creating a sci-fi world and making you feel like you were truly apart of it. The music and the beautiful level design all contribute to the feeling that you were in the game. However, the game does not leverage this encompassing feeling enough in the horror department. I feel that the game would have been a lot more fun if they upped the scare factor as there was already an underlying &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; feeling. Lastly, I found myself lost. More than I would like to admit. If you forget to unlock certain doors at the beginning it makes it much more difficult to travel around. Quests should have given a better idea of where to go and the fastest route to get there.Overall I enjoyed my time in Prey. Some aspects could have been improved and for that reason $60 I feel is too pricey. I would have no problem picking it up around $30 - $35. I do hope to see a second installment of this game, and hopefully they improve on the elements that were lacking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not much of a shooter, so if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for, look elsewhere. If you&rsquo;re looking for an immersive first person sci-fi/horror adventure, I think you&rsquo;ll probably love this.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this, although I did find myself lost on frequent occasion, and having to walk long distances back. Probably put 35 hours or so into it through completion. Well worth the cost of admission.</p>

<h5 id="bioshock-s-little-brother">Bioshock&rsquo;s little brother</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you like Bioshock you will love this game. I am a huge fan of the Bioshock series, although Prey&rsquo;s storyline is not as interesting as Bioshock it still has the same feel not only in the storyline but in the controls and look of the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-decent-game">A decent game.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed this experience. I liked the setting and the game play. The game encourages the player to find their own solutions to solve puzzles and make their way through the environments. You have a bunch of tools and abilities and are given free reign to figure out how to reach an objective. I like that. I went through the game a few times using different play styles. I keeps this interesting. Plus no matter how far you advance there&rsquo;s always an enemy that can offer an challenge.Overall I had a good time.</p>
