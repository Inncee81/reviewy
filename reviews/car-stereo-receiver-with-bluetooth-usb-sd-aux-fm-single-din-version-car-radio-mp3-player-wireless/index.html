<h5 id="amazing-mp3-audio-center">Amazing MP3-Audio center!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great MP3 Stereo for under $30! It seems like it&rsquo;s great quality and well made. I got this for my husband. His truck had an old cassette player which he never used. This was he perfect thing to take music from his phone to his truck. We love the included remote control. This makes it so easy to change songs or even answer your phone when driving. This unit is great for hands-free calling. It also has FM radio. He likes the EQ display on it. It also has USB outlet, Aux (mic) outlet and TF card slot. This was the perfect item to bring our old truck&rsquo;s audio up to date with newer cars. It works great and was easy to install. This unit is very nice! I would Definitely recommend it</p>

<h5 id="super-nice-stereo-easy-to-use-easy-to-install">Super Nice Stereo, easy to use, easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this great stereo for my brother,who had a car with no stereo in it. This stereo was easy to install, just had to purchase an install kit. He got it installed in just a couple of hours (maybe less than that). This radio is working great for him, allowing him to connect his phone to the radio, which he really likes, there were no issues getting the phone and radio to sync, was so simple to do he and I did it and neither of us know much about tech. He loves that he can plug his phone into this radio to charge, or he can also plug his ipod to the radio. This radio is a great price for what it is, it is well made and easy to install.</p>

<h5 id="who-needs-a-cd-player-anymore">Who needs a cd player anymore :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my little sister. She had an old tape deck that wasn&rsquo;t working out very well for her (she is 18). We installed this today and it is great. THIS HAS NO CD PLAYER. She only uses bluetooth and aux so this is perfect for her. She doesn&rsquo;t even own a cd. The price was awesome too!! We were looking at a similar unit from Pioneer for almost $100. Very happy with this one. Easy to sink to your bluetooth. It sounds great on her Toyota Corolla. She does not have subwoofers but the 60 x 4 watt built in amp powers her speakers very nice. I love the sound of bluetooth very clear music.It is cool to see the transitions in technology in my lifetime. I have seen 8 tracks in cars, then tape decks, then cd, now media players. Pretty cool you don&rsquo;t have to carry around huge CD wallets anymore OMG those were the days haha.Now my sister and her friends can bluetooth from their phones whatever they want to listen to. She does not have to use her tape with a cord to listen to music anymore haha. She is very happy.</p>

<h5 id="good-deal-for-price">Good deal for price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For only $30 this is a good deal. It&rsquo;s a simple basic stereo. It doesn&rsquo;t have a CD player, but it has a place for an aux, USB and an SD card. The aux was what my kids had been wanting anyway. It also comes with a remote (we&rsquo;ll see how long my family keeps up with that). It&rsquo;s fairly small, so most people will need a kit to make it compatable, but it&rsquo;s still a good deal. It has wiring for front and rear speakers. We had planned to use it in our Tahoe, but since it has third row seating(and a third set of speakers), it wouldn&rsquo;t work (although, someone more mechanical may be able to make it work for a third set of speakers). We ended up using it in our son&rsquo;s Escape and it worked just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="considering-the-low-cost-works-well-however">Considering the low cost: works well&hellip; however&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;needless to say, it didn&rsquo;t fit &lsquo;effortlessly&rsquo; in my &lsquo;03 Nissan Sentra like it stated it would. There were no screw holes corresponding to the mounting brackets&hellip; I had to use some creativity and hard wire to &lsquo;tie&rsquo; the unit on to the brackets. However, after attaching the aftermarket wire harness &amp; plugging it all in&hellip; it works fine. The low cost of this receiver can be felt when pushing the buttons&hellip; not as &lsquo;high tech&rsquo; and smooth a feel as with other higher end electronics. Having said that, it sounds very good! The effects: loud/on/off, bass, treble, balance etc. are easy to adjust. (I have no use for the BlueTooth feature, but I will be using the USB/mp3 slot.) Again, for the price and reasonable quality, I recommend.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-car-stereo">Awesome car stereo !!!!!</h5>

<h5 id="he-s-really-good-at-working-worth-his-hands">He&rsquo;s really good at working worth his hands</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this stereo for my brother as a birthday gift. He&rsquo;s really good at working worth his hands. The radio in his 2000 sentra was stock and I wanted him to have a way to play his tunes. He loves it, got an installation kit and spent the afternoon putting it in, watching how-tos on YouTube. Now his car has a good stereo and a remote and I&rsquo;m jealous. The sound is great, the controls are easy to figure out and now I&rsquo;m bugging him to help me put one in my car.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great Sound!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a great purchase for a car stereo reciever! I was a little weiry at first about the quality because of the low price but decided to give it a try. It did not dissapoint at all! This is very good quality and the stereo sound is great! I love that I can connect this to my bluetooth and listen to all my favorite music with this. It was a replacement for my outdated car stereo and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier! This was very easy to install and very durable. Love it!</p>
