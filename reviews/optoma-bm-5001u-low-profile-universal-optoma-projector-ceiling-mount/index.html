<h5 id="save-time-hassel-effort-and-your-sanity-get-this-mount-i-love-it">SAVE TIME, HASSEL, EFFORT and YOUR SANITY! GET THIS MOUNT! I LOVE IT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary:Installation was SIMPLE, adjustments are EASY, mount is STURDY, movement/play in the mount is NONE and the price is WORTH IT!General:I absolutely love this mount! I am using this mount, to mount my &ldquo;Optoma GT1080&rdquo; from the ceiling at 6ft 2in distance from the screen to the lens and have a 149in screen size ( looks AMAZING)&hellip;I can&rsquo;t express enough, how much I enjoyed using this projector mount.Quality: GreatThis mount is extremely sturdy. The metal used, is thick enough to NOT allow for bending or flexing. There is NO wiggle or movement in the mount once secured and fastened. There are metal gears (which are tight) that are used to make finite adjustments, both horizontally (to make it level) and vertically (to help line with both the bottom and top of the screen).Price: Acceptable (WORTH IT)Im my mind, I was only desiring to spend up to $50 on a mount. I was thinking that I could get a decent mount for that price. Having worked with a few of the mounts in that price range, I was not really impressed. Therefore, after reading some of the other reviews, I decided to spend the extra money and get this one. I figured if I didn&rsquo;t like it, it would go back and I will get a &lt;$50 one. But let me make it clear, it is NOT going to be sent back!I could have spent $30ish less and bought the &ldquo;Peerless PRGUNV Precision Gear Universal Projector Mount&rdquo; ($83 - Which appears to have the same gear adjustments, which like the most about this mount), but I bought this one, as I like the solid metal plate over the extension arms (just personal preference), although, I had to use one of the extension arms on my projector. So I am using 2 hole from the plate and 1 extension arm. Seen in attached images.Experience: MediumI am by no means an EXPERT in projector mounts. I only offer my opinion and thoughts based on what little experience I have had with projector mounts. I have only installed approx. 20 projectors and mounts, when I was working for a Home Automation company, installing Home Theaters and other fun home automation toys.Potential Enhancements:It would be awesome if there was the ability to have a small amount of lateral movement, in case you were unable to mount the projector 100% center, or to compensate for the projector mounting points not being center to the lens (I had to secure my mount 1/4in off center to factor for the lens, so it would be center to the screen).</p>

<h5 id="good-match-for-my-optoma-projector-though-installation-could-be-improved">Good match for my Optoma projector, though installation could be improved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount is exactly what I wanted for my projector. I like the low-profile design since it&rsquo;s for my basement which doesn&rsquo;t have very high ceilings, and it feels very sturdy.It is fairly easy to adjust all degrees of angle and position, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry too much about getting everything exact since it&rsquo;s so simple to make adjustments after installation. The mount itself is manufactured by Peerless and rebranded as Optoma.Installation itself was fairly easy. It probably took me like 45 minutes, but I&rsquo;d imagine it should take much less time for others. Literally about 35-40 of those installation minutes were me just reading the instructions and trying to figure out what I need to do. This is because the instruction manual has at least 10 different ways to install it depending on what Optoma projector model you have. I used it with an Optoma HD131Xe, which is a very recent model not listed in the instruction manual. Because of this, I had to take a best guess at which installation method to use. I ended up guessing wrong, which wasn&rsquo;t really a big deal. The main difference between most installations is which size screws and washers to use, and where on the universal plate to put the screws through (there are many many holes on there to fit the plethora of projector model screw mount patterns).Now that I know what I&rsquo;m doing, installing it again from scratch would literally only take 5-10 minutes.Note to anyone else using this with a HD131Xe: I used the first installation instructions in the manual, and it ended up being mostly right, except you&rsquo;ll end up using the smallest screws in there to mount the plate to the projector, and thinner washers than in the picture to get the screw to reach all the way into the threads on the projector itself.Note to anyone who hasn&rsquo;t already selected a projector: I highly recommend the HD131Xe if your budget is under a thousand. There are certainly better projectors in the 1.5k-2k price range, but this one is an extremely good value, since it is half the price of those, plus it even came with a fifty dollar amazon credit at the time of purchase. I also like that it&rsquo;s black instead of white, so the mount matches it very well.Pros:- Excellent compatibility with many Optoma projectors- Solid, sturdy, and easily adjustable- Low-profile which is perfect for low ceilings like mine- Black mount is a perfect match for my HD131XeCons:- Need to update instructions; newer Optoma models not listed in there (though they are still compatible)- Price is much higher than off-brand mounts</p>

<h5 id="solid-mount">Solid Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I installed this projector mount this weekend. I must say, the instructions aren&rsquo;t the best (even for an engineer). I did manage to put it together in about an hour. It holds the project secure, and including the height of my projector, i&rsquo;d say everything is within ~9 inches of the ceiling. Having 8&rsquo; ceilings, a ceiling hugging mount was a must for me.</p>

<h5 id="optoma-mount-bm-5001u-mounting-kit">Optoma Mount BM-5001U-Mounting Kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this mount after recently using a universal mount to mount my Optoma HD20 projector. The BM-5001U is a little more expensive than the universal mounts but well worth it. It is great that the plate fits exactly to my HD20 projector and then easily slid onto the base plate. The mount is very solid and does not move at all when my 1 year old is walking upstairs right above my mount that is located in the basement. I highly recommend this mount for the Optoma HD20. The only thing I would change is that the mount only has an adjustment for vertical (up and down) and tilt. It would have been great if the mount would have been adjustable from left to right. I had to readjust the base several times until it was perfectly centered on my 106&rdquo; screen. Still a great mount though.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-any-optoma-projector-great-adjustment-features-poor-location-of-1-of-adjusters">Great for any Optoma projector, Great adjustment features, poor location of 1 of adjusters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for any and all optoma projectors and can fit some other brands if they are smaller versions. only problem I had was the adjusters are kind of a soft plastic and even when using a very large Philips head it was still spinning/stripping. I had to use pliars to do my adjustments, which was difficult bc of its location so close to ceiling. I eventually got it were I wanted. and the quick connect feature to remove projector is a lifesaver when cleaning unit or replacing a bulb. I am very glad I purchased this. if they would make the adjusters both back facing it would make it much easier. you could possibly make an adapter to the quick connect piece to fit any other brand.</p>

<h5 id="projector-works-good-and-great-picture-quality">Projector works good and great picture quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Projector works good and great picture quality. However the lamp only lasted 303 hours for me. Should have at least 4,000 hours. Replacement lamps cost $100+&hellip;</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-mount">High quality mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent.. high quality. I could hang from this thing. Didn&rsquo;t quite fit my projector but the extra hardware they give you made it work. Low how low profile it is..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
