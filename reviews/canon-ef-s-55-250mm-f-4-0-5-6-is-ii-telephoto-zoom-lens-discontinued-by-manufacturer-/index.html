Product description
Bring your photographic subjects closer with this Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS Image Stabilizer Telephoto Zoom Lens. It is designed with Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon&rsquo;s 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Filter Size - 58mm Max. Diameter - x Length 2.8 in. x 4.3 in./70 x 108mm (maximum lens length) Weight - 13.8 oz./390g Canon 1 year limited warranty</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Incorporating Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer technology, this Canon 55-250mm telephoto zoom lens captures long distance, low-light shots far better than many comparable lenses, helping you photograph the far-off action of athletes or zoom in for an intimate portrait with a blurred background. The high-zoom-ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). More significantly, the image stabilizer effect creates an equivalent shutter speed of roughly four stops faster than the same size lens without an image stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you can hold a 250mm lens steadily is normally 1/250th of a second, this Canon lens will let you hand-hold shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. The lens also boasts a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration to create excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Delivering an excellent performance at an affordable price for all photographers, the 55-250mm lens carries a one-year warranty.</p>

<h5 id="love-love-love-this-lens">LOVE LOVE LOVE this lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE LOVE LOVE this lens. I received this lens when I purchased the Canon T4i (from Amazon) and have since upgraded to a Canon T6i and KEPT the 55-250 lens as my only lens! Although the naysayers will say that this is a AMATEUR lens or that it is not &ldquo;good glass&rdquo;,I am in approximately 20 magazines a year and I have had centerfolds upon centerfolds printed in national magazines, so don&rsquo;t let the cheap price fool you&hellip;.This is an excellent lens and it really boils down to what my mentor told me years ago- &ldquo;If you have the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; for photography, you will make great photos&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-zoom">Great zoom!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this lens!! It&rsquo;s an awesome zoom! I consider myself intermediate level hobbyist, and I do photoshoots for people at no cost to give them family photos with better quality than mall studios. This lens is perfect for those who want the off-in-the-distance look in their photos, and I don&rsquo;t have to be ridiculously far to achieve it.It&rsquo;s also great for when I photograph landscapes like the wild bluebonnets out here in the Texas countryside.I do not have professional knowledge, so for pro&rsquo;s I would recommend looking in to reviews on canon&rsquo;s site&hellip; for hobbyists and those that are just looking for a decent zoom, this is a great option!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-2nd-lens-for-t2i-beginners">Excellent 2nd Lens for T2i beginners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not a professional photographer, I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed taking pictures but until a few months ago I was stuck with point and shoot camera&rsquo;s from Canon. I bought a T2i off of Amazon with the 18/55mm lens hoping to get more into photography and get out more, but I quickly noticed I needed a something with better zoom for shots at a distance. This lens is an excellent addition. I really wanted to find a cheap lens, though after paying a grand for a camera when I barely know how to use it, that may sound counter productive.Pro&rsquo;s: Price, capabilities, plug and play.Con&rsquo;s: Noise, build quality, weight.It doesn&rsquo;t seem that cheap, it appears to be identical to the stock 18/55mm lens, but the increased size gives it a less than solid feel - it&rsquo;s not flimsy, just doesn&rsquo;t feel super strong. It is also considerably heavier than the <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>55</sub> lens, just from the feel in hand I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s 3x the weight. It also seems to make a lot more noise when in AF than the smaller lens, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s this particular unit or something else, but it&rsquo;s noticeable and borderline obnoxious.Despite this, it&rsquo;s an excellent lens for a beginner like me, and well worth the price when added on to the price of the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-lens-on-my-camera-most-of-the-time">This is the lens on my camera most of the time.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this on a Canon t4i, and it is overall a pretty good lens. I have it on my camera most of the time because the 55-250mm range is pretty useful for everything and it produces quality shots.The autofocus is accurate though not particularly fast. Zoom works well for either shots in the distance or something closer with a pretty good depth of field and bokeh if you can get nice and tight to the subject (close ups of flowers, for example.) Pictures generally look good and sharp.I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s my own imagination, as I haven&rsquo;t done any real testing, but I feel like color saturation drops off in low light compared to my other lenses with the same settings and I occasionally have to tease out the color a bit in Lightroom.It does also show some slight vignetting at certain f-stops and focal lengths. Not enough to really ruin a picture, but it can become apparent when adjusting contrast in Lightroom.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> because it&rsquo;s a good, dependable lens, but doesn&rsquo;t blow me away. It&rsquo;s my go-to workhorse but not my favorite lens.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-lens-for-the-price">Great lens for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for the priceRelatively cheap and very good addition to the standard 18-55mm. I bought it when I only had my 18-55mm (without IS) with my Xti.Meanwhile I bought the 15-85mm which has lowered my need for this one a bit and the larger overlap makes the 40-60 range less awkward.Even portraits with this lens look better than the original 18-55mm (mk I)250mm requires steady hand or tripod but I&rsquo;ve been able to make handheld shots throughout the range.It&rsquo;s a bit slow for indoors but great for outdoors and candid shots. It&rsquo;s not super-heavy either.The lens got stuck once but Canon repaired it free of charge (just shipping cost).Own: Xti/T3i/18-55mm mk I, mk II, 15-85mm, 55-250mm, 50mm f1.8</p>

<h5 id="you-see-a-different-world">You see a different world!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fist off I am just a take a picture or two at family functions or vacations. I have had this lens for four months now and by no means am I a professional photographer. But when my nephew asked me if I would take his wedding pictures I thought that I should at least invest in a better lens than my Canon Rebel XTi camera came with (EFS 18-55mm). Wow this lens that I purchased gives you a whole new perspective on how pictures can really look with a different lens. The clarity of the images for me were a big difference from my stock lens. Crisp clear images. Still learning though but very very happy with my new lens. I find that I am now taking more pictures. Oh and my nephew and his new wife were very happy with the wedding pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-a-good-quality-lens-especially-for-the-price">It is a good quality lens especially for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It is a good quality lens especially for the price. We had been priced out of a long lens for years, despite wanting one. This is one nice thing about having an older camera (Digital Rebel XT, purchased in 2007), the accessories come down in price along with the camera. While this lens may not be top of the line, professional grade, it works well for us taking nice crisp photos with that beautiful look you can only get from a long lens, especially good for portrait photography.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="camera-canon-eos-rebel-t6">Camera: Canon EOS Rebel T6</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera: Canon EOS Rebel T6This fit into our camera perfect. Zoom is very nice and clear. Much better than zoom that came with the camera.</p>
