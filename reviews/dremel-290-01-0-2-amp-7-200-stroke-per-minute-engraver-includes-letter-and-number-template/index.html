<p>About Dremel: A History of Brilliance and Innovation
Founded in 1932 in Racine, Wisconsin, Dremel is the industry leader in rotary tools. The company owes its success to the inventive genius of its founder and namesake, Albert J. Dremel. In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:I gave this a one star at first because I felt a little cheated because I didn&rsquo;t see the free 9924 engraving point that was supposed to be included, then felt really bad once I found the missing 9924 so I&rsquo;m updating it. This might have happened to others who bought this item and complained about the same thing. The product does come with a free 9924, but it&rsquo;s a small piece. They placed it within the plastic packaging. Therefore, if you unwrapped it and threw away the plastic, you also threw out your free piece. See the picture for more details.I tried it&hellip;it works great! It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to switch out the engraving points. The screw holding the piece in place is very small so you have to be careful not to drop that sucker. You sort of need a special, small and strong screw driver to remove it, so be aware of that. Also, I suggest to remove it on a table with a cloth on top so if you do drop the screw you can find it&hellip; I&rsquo;m calling it a screw because that&rsquo;s the only name for it&hellip;But that this super tiny&hellip;can&rsquo;t stress that enough. I&rsquo;m new to this game, but I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll be using this thing a lot! Great for the price!I just received it, therefore I haven&rsquo;t tried it. However, how can I try the machine when it is missing the tip. &ldquo;The included 9924 carbide engraving point ensures precise result.&rdquo; &gt; NOT INCLUDEDI plugged it in and it makes a very loud noise. I think this is normal&hellip;but its my first engraving tool so I don&rsquo;t know.There is no way of contacting Dremel so I hope they see this review and contact me because I&rsquo;d like the tip please.I won&rsquo;t change my review until I receive the piece I was promised.Thanks&hellip;and for the rest of you fine people out there..beware or at least know to buy the tip separate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to return this Dremel Engraver 290-01 I purchased from Amazon 11/9/2015. First I was very dissappointed that once I received the unit, it did not come with a mini screwdriver to open and close the set screw that holds the carbide tip in place. So then I bought one from Amazon (Amazon Herco® HE826 Precision Screwdriver Set ASIN: B000CCUFT2). Now after receiving the screwdriver, I have tried repeatedly to get the carbide tip provided to be securely set inside the unit.I assume this Dremel Engraver 290-01 unit must be defective as I cannot get the carbide tip to stay affixed inside the unit no matter how many times I try to open and close the setting screw on the side of the unit.This is an extremely poor design if tips cannot be easily changed out, tips do not stay firmly held in the unit, and require the customer to purchase a special mini screwdriver to use the unit. VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!!!</p>

<p>Very unsatisfied with this product. Bought this Dremel engraver about one year ago. Worked fine for six months then started shorting-out. Limped it along for several more months until the short become so bad that it quit working entirely. I thought it was just a fluke that it had a short. So I bought another one. Used it once for about three minutes and it worked fine. Just went to use it again and it&rsquo;s not working. Makes a soft buzzing noise, but will not engrave. Very frustrating! Sending this one back and will never buy a Dremel engarver again!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I obsessively write my name on all of my possessions. All my tools, electronic devices, and other possessions. Until my purchase of this engraver, I did all of this with permanent marker, and dealt with the marker getting rubbed off or fading over time. I wanted an engraver, but I assumed that they were expensive because I&rsquo;d never looked at the prices for them before. I guess the word &ldquo;engraver&rdquo; just sounds expensive to me&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.Anyway, one day this was in my recommended items list and I was surprised that it was under $20 dollars. Yes, this was a total impulse purchase and amazon&rsquo;s advertising algorithm works really well. Well done.Since receiving the engraver, I have used it to write my name on everything that I can. My tools, my phone, my laptops, everything. It is the same urge that you get to write on everything with a permanent marker when you have one in hand, or the urge you get to label everything you get with a label maker, only this thing amplifies this urge because it&rsquo;s a power tool, and who doesn&rsquo;t like power tools?The engraver itself: My one complaint is that it is super loud. I&rsquo;m very protective of my hearing, I don&rsquo;t use this thing without hearing protection. It works well, and is dead simple to use, and after about 30 seconds of practice on a piece of scrap aluminum, I was proficient enough to use it on something that I value.</p>

<h5 id="a-keeper">A Keeper!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product at a great price. The only problem is the set screw for the tip is EXTREMELY small, and took the smallest screwdriver I could find. I finally found an old pocket screwdriver I used to carry 30 years ago. Be careful to use a very narrow blade screw driver, or you will damage the set screw hole threads. In order to insert the tip, you have to back the screw out, and then insert the tip. About <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch of the tip should show if properly inserted. Snug the screw down (not too hard), and gently pull on the tip. If it comes out, then you didn&rsquo;t insert it far enough. I believe these two reasons are why there are so many reports of people stripping the threads on the set screw hole. The carbide tip is plenty good enough for average use. I even marked my crow bars. I recommend you use a light touch, and practice on some scrap material before actually marking your stuff. Hold it like an ink pen, and write away. Adjust the stroke (speed) control knob to match the material.</p>
