<h5 id="i-have-lots-of-phone-chargers-but-this-one-seems-habit-forming">I Have Lots of Phone Chargers&hellip;But This One Seems Habit Forming</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The way we use our smart phones today, we need to charge our phones two or three times a day. Once I picked up this BaiJi Power Bank Charger, I found that I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine living without one or two of these. That&rsquo;s because of its size and shape.When I saw the box, it was a small box that look like a burger would be inside. I opened to see something like a shape of a burger patty, a thick one. Wasn&rsquo;t sure of this small gadget would say what it does. To recharge my smart phones to full capacity.I tested it and I got about two full charges after discharging my phone to 0. Yeah, I know that isn&rsquo;t the greatest thing to do, but I just wanted to see how many charges it can take.This was a life saver because I have left the house without the standard cell charger several times and if I get into someone&rsquo;s car, they don&rsquo;t have a charger for me. I forgot I had this in my briefcase. It worked just fine. Didn&rsquo;t rapidly charge my phone, but it allowed me to work on my phone all day without draining it to zero.I love the rubberized casing and the gripping sides. The compass is an awesome feature that will help you when you stray from the trail. The flashlight is priceless and adds to the multi-life saving features. Yes, keeping your phone on is life saving for most.The only downside is that it only has one USB port. I say, just buy another BaiJi phone bank. For the price of $25.99 it will be worth it. You can bank on that!Let me know if you have questions via the comments area below. [+]PositiveLogic | Amazon Customer since 2000 | Got this at no cost or discount in exchange for an honest review. I have reviewed this item the same impartiality as with items I purchase.</p>

<p>I am here to tell you about this amazing power bank! My husband and I absolutely love it. We can get multiple charges for our phones of this power bank. It has been dropped and survived. We haven&rsquo;t tested out the waterproof aspect, but I am sure it will withstand water nicely as it has rubber seals to protect the ports. We haven&rsquo;t had a need for the compass yet, but it seem to work just fine. I love that there is a way to attach it to a lanyard or a clip of sorts. It is palm sized so it&rsquo;s not too bulky, can easily be carried for a hiking, biking, camping trip with ease. The flashlight we thought was a little weak. It really threw us off since the rest of the unit was designed so nice and detailed. The charging lights are bright and easy to see. We are quite happy with this product and will encourage family and friends to look into it as well. We are planning to buy this for my husbands 2 older boys for Christmas.</p>

<p>I have quite a few power banks, two that are 10400mAh, one thats 6000 and now this guy - 8000 mAh, all are from Amazon and were priced pretty much the same - around 20$, the most expensive being 25$. This one is currently listed at 19.99$.Its very portable, light weight and looks nice too. It has one USB port, small power button and four battery indicators - 25%, 50% 75% and 100%, they light up blue. On the opposite side is a hook for a lanyard (doesnt come with it) and a compass - very interesting feature. When i showed my husband he said &ldquo;why??&rdquo;. Since you will typically use this with a cell phone, odds are you have a gps and google maps as well. Personally though, I find it a fun little bonus. Ive lived in &ldquo;my&rdquo; town for almost 6 years now and still have no clue which direction is north or south (without looking out and seeing the sun).Right next to the charger jack is a small flashlight, its not going to light up a room but it can help when unlocking a door or searching for stuff in a bag in the dark.I have two IOS devices - IPad Mini 3 which I use most of the time, it has a very good battery life. Then I have IPhone 5C which is the exact opposite, small capacity and awful battery life. I dont use it for anything else except calls, texts, GPS and Pokemon Go (I know, super nerdy). The game (most games really) eats battery like crazy. Ive actually witnessed the power going DOWN while plugged in when playing the game once or twice which is crazy. That said, this power bank charges surprisingly fast, faster than when I have it plugged in the car, even when playing the game at the same time. I would say on full battery I can charge the IPhone 5C about 3 times.I do recommend you use a CERTIFIED lightning cord, fake ones tend to charge slower.MEASUREMENTS: 3.8&rdquo; long, 3.3&rdquo; wide, approx 0.85&rdquo; thickit weighs 7.0oz without any cords, making it the lightest power bank I own and also the reason why i often choose it over the others. The 10400 mAh ones weight between 8 and 8.5oz, you can charge the phone more times with them but i can actually tell the difference in weight which is a big deal for me also.CHARGING:It comes fully charged out of the box, i recommend charging it over night the first time around, after that it should take around 4 hours for full chargeINSTRUCTIONS:Push power button once shortly to turn the device on, hold power button for about 5 seconds until the blue LED light shuts off to turn the device off, it also turns off on its own after a few seconds when its unplugged from a phone, to preserve the battery. To turn the flashlight on click the power button twice fast, to turn it off, click it twice again. This flash light has a flashing mode too - turn it on by clicking twice first and then click one more time.PROS:- ok price although I have seem stronger power banks for less- shock proof, will definitely withstand dropping on the ground, i tried- the listing and box mention that its waterproof, neither say what rating it is so i dont know if it can be submerged and for how long. i did try it in heavy thunder storm and it worked great- i do like the compass- charges fast- very lightweightCONS:- only one USB port so cant charge two devices at once, all of the other power banks I have, cheaper ones included, have two ports- the round shape isnt my favorite, i like to stack my phone up on a power bank so its easy to carry around that way, this one, even though its so light weight and small, somehow seems bulky to me- the manual is pretty bad, doesnt really say almost anything, just shows a few pictures with descriptions- no idea what waterproof rating this is, if any, the box doesnt say, neither does the manual- the two 10400 power banks i have were priced between 17.99 and 19.99, this one is only 8000 mAh and its priced the same, its still pretty powerful, i can charge my phone a few times with it on full battery, but if youre getting it for an ipad or an iphone 6 or newer, you may want to consider a stronger one, unless you are specifically looking for something very light and waterproof.- the flashing feature on the flash light is unnecessary in my opinion, although thats a matter of personal preference. When i have the flashlight on and accidentally hit the power button again, it will start flashing, i find that annoying.- the rubber coating catches dust easily&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Overall this is a good product although it could use improvement, i am still giving it 4 stars as i do use it a lot. It comes well wrapped in a box along with short charger cord (you will have to use your own cords to connect to the device that you intend to charge unless you have an Android in which case you can use said white cord as well).</p>
