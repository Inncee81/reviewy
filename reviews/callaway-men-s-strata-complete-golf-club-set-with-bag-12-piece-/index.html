<h5 id="5-stars-for-the-price-performance-of-these-clubs-very-solid-choice-for-a-beginner">5 Stars for the Price / Performance of these clubs - Very solid choice for a beginner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the RIGHT hand Callaway Men&rsquo;t Strata Set - I&rsquo;m sure there is no difference for lefties.I&rsquo;m an experienced golfer that plays with fairly high-end equipment that seems to get partially upgraded every season or two whether I plan to, or not. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for me to spend $1,000-$1,400 annually on upgrading equipment.Recently, I attended a 5 day golf clinic (all day, 5 days) more aimed at beginning golfers to work on some fundamentals since there are a couple things about my swing that I&rsquo;m not happy with.One of the adult male beginners had this set of clubs he&rsquo;d just purchased after using loaners on the range for about a month. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with them, and had no idea what they cost him. My assumption from just looking at them was that they were a boxed set in the $700-$900 range probably competing with the Adam&rsquo;s brand. I had no idea these clubs could be had for around $200.I was partnered up with this guy for a 9 hole scramble on the second day of camp. For kicks, I asked if I could hit his driver. I hit a very low spin 240 yard drive right down the fairway with one practice swing - this is a normal drive for me distance-wise. I was impressed - again, still not knowing the price tag.For the rest of the round, I hit his clubs. They were fine&hellip; they really were. I thought the putter was a little light, and the woods were a little light at the club head (but honestly, they just felt like the Ping G30&rsquo;s to me&hellip; hit like &lsquo;em too). I don&rsquo;t think using his clubs for that round cost me a single stroke - in fact, I think I probably lost a couple strokes because all 5 of my drives were essentially straight. The irons and hybrids carried well&hellip; no issues at all. I&rsquo;ve messed around with starter clubs before, and years ago (many), I burned through a few sets myself. The quality of these clubs surpasses other starter sets I&rsquo;ve played.I&rsquo;m surprised that these clubs can be had for around $200. It seems to me that they&rsquo;re quite the bargain at that price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-set-for-the-price">Great set for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only reason for 4 stars is the set needed a sand wedge. Other than that I am using everything except the diver, and I am using a Callaway Big Bertha V Series for that. This is a great low cost set, and I especially like the 5 hybrid. Quality seems higher than expected for this nice set of clubs, especially since they are by Callaway.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-beginner-clubs">Great beginner clubs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a beginner, just started golfing a few months back so I thought I would pick up a cheap set to begin with and so far these have been great. These feel heavy in my hands, but that is how I prefer them. Similar quality build with some of my friends more expensive sets and for my height (5&rsquo; 8&rdquo;) these are spot on perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-220-ive-spent-in-awhile">Best $220 Ive spent in awhile!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really glad I bought these clubs. Even though I&rsquo;m not a beginner, I have not played in quite sometime, much less owned my own clubs ever. Yes I read alot of reviews on this set along with the bigger sets. I chose these due to they are cheaper than the others. Although I have only played 9 holes with them so far, I did not experience any of my clubs breaking or have any other unusual damage to them, they have just a couple scuffs from my lack of experience with the game. I would recommend these to anyone! As for the fitting, at first it felt like these might be a bit short, but that was due to my improper stance which was fixed over this past weekend, so yes they do fit someone that is 5&rsquo;10&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-purchase">Amazing purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic clubs for the price. I am a woman who is 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; and needed to get men&rsquo;s clubs. I have played with these a few times and they are sturdy and the perfect height. Highly recommend if you are just getting into golf.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-starter-set">Solid Starter Set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived on time and exactly as advertised. Great set for a newbie or the occasional golfer. Never owned a hybrid club prior but it has quickly become my go-to club. Recommended the set to a co-worker and he has nothing but good things to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-5-9-and-these-clubs-fit-me-pretty-well-i-m-also-a-beginner-and-these-clubs">I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; and these clubs fit me pretty well. I&rsquo;m also a beginner and these clubs &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; and these clubs fit me pretty well. I&rsquo;m also a beginner and these clubs have been great. The clubs are fantastic and the bag has a ton of pockets and is made very well. Love this product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="much-better">Much better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As I did not find significant comments on the putter I&rsquo;ll address this first. I find it a fantastic putter allowing for accuracy in distance and ideal alignment lines. It is almost a mini mallet style which is great compared to my last putter. The irons play great and the 5 hybrid is nice for 200 yds for me. I have not used the driver or wood yet as I&rsquo;m using a different model for this purpose. All this said I&rsquo;m a beginner and shaved several strokes off my game with this set with the biggest difference being the putter and solid irons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pga-tour-here-i-come">PGA tour here I come!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had my best game ever with these clubs. Love them. So much better than the standard length clubs I played with for last 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="gap">Gap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too big of a gap between the &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; and the longest iron.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very nice clubs, delivered on time very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-this-trash">DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are complete garbage. They feel cheap and my driver dented on the 1st day out. I would not recommend them to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Met my expectations</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-thumbs-up">Two Thumbs Up!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this set on Prime Day so I got an awesome deal on them. Have got a few rounds under my belt with them and they have been great to learn the game with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="drivers-are-cheaply-made-irons-are-ok">DRIVERS ARE CHEAPLY MADE. Irons are ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this on Prime Day as a starter set. Initially, thought the quality was great. Finally had the time this weekend to try them out at the local driving range, when 30 swings&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-me-for-my-birthday-and-these-clubs-are-amazing-especially-for-the-price">&hellip; for me for my birthday and these clubs are amazing especially for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My girlfriend got these for me for my birthday and these clubs are amazing especially for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-for-beginner">Great value for beginner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For a total beginner like me, this set seems to be good quality. Bag is nice as well. Having a hard time hitting with the 5 Hybrid, but I think the user is more to blame than the&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="slight-zipper-issue">Slight zipper issue!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Clubs are great! Quality is great. We had an issue with the zipper on the bottom portion of bag the first day we got it.</p>
