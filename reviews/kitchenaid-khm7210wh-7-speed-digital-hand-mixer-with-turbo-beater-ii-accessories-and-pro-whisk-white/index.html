<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this mixer back in Dec. of 2014. I previous had a 9 speed mixer, but this one works just as well as the other. It really does measure up to what is says. We use the mixer moderately. Mostly for cakes and cookies and the cookies are always a double batch. Just the other day it quit on me after making whipped cream. The Amazon warranty was expired, so I went to the Kitchenaid website to see what their warranty was. I was glad to see that it had a full one year warranty. I contacted Kitchenaid customer service and they are replacing the mixer at no charge. Even the shipping is free on both the new one and the one I have to return. So for Kitchenaid, they get a 5 star rating. Plus, the customer service call was located in the US, not overseas with someone who couldn&rsquo;t speak English. The call took about 5 minutes. I must say I was very impressed with their customer service and very please with the outcome. They also put on a new 1 year warranty on the mixer, which is another bonus to me.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-let-the-speed-complaints-fool-you">Don&rsquo;t let the speed complaints fool you&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was nervous to purchase this because of the comments about lower speed, but now I know exactly why so many others weren&rsquo;t concerned about it. Yes, this mixer does not go nearly as fast as my previous mixers (the last of which broke while making a stiff buttercream), but there&rsquo;s a reason why - the beaters. Notice how they&rsquo;re thinner and shaped differently than the standard, flat-edged beaters? Other mixers need higher speeds because those flat-edged beaters hold onto whatever you&rsquo;re mixing and get clogged easier. The ones that come with this mixer do all the work for you.I make vegan cupcakes regularly, and I use vegan butter in my frosting which has to be creamed cold, straight out of the fridge. With my old mixer, it would get stuck in the middle of the beaters and take a good minute or longer to get broken up and be creamed even at high speeds. This mixer creams that same butter in mere seconds. It also handles my buttercream with ease, and that stuff gets very thick and hard to mix before it gets smooth and creamy.After several uses, I can definitely recommend this mixer. It&rsquo;s easier to maneuver, doesn&rsquo;t make my arms tired, and super easy to clean. The vents don&rsquo;t get sprayed and clogged with dry goods because of the low speed, and the locking cord stays out of the way. Very pleased with my purchase and excited to have a mixer that actually does some of the work for me.</p>

<h5 id="i-was-still-amazed-it-is-very-quiet">I was still amazed! It is very quiet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though the reviews stated how quiet it was, I was still amazed! It is very quiet, not too heavy, easy to handle, beaters insert and eject easily, and does an excellent job of mixing my cake and muffin batters. I am not a big baker, but, if I wanted to make bread or something more than cakes or muffins, I have the KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer, which, is wonderful. I have arthritis, especially in my hands and wrists. I was concerned that this mixer would be too heavy or awkward and I would have difficulty using it. Not at all. This is a great, inexpensive hand mixer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-mixer-more-than-any-other-good-power-good-design-and-quiet">Love this mixer more than any other. Good power, good design, and quiet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second KitchenAid hand mixer. I absolutely love these. They have consistent power and don&rsquo;t slow down under pressure (as a Cuisinart I&rsquo;ve had did). Good power, quiet and does the job every time. Plus the red is simply beautiful :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love KitchenAid. I wish I had grabbed one with a bit more color pop. Works great and is super easy to use. A bit heavy, but from what I have experienced all KitchenAid items are a bit heavy&hellip;makes it a bit more durable than those flimsy off brand ones. Highly recommend.Seller was great, shipped fast and arrived in no time!If you find my review helpful, please click below saying that this review was helpful. If you have any questions about this let me know and I can answer them for you!</p>

<h5 id="i-couldn-t-have-picked-a-better-christmas-gift-for-my-wife-and-she-loves-it">I couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually it beats the expectations! I couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it! Very nice hand mixer and it is so quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worthwhile-purchase-of-a-quiet-mixer">Worthwhile purchase of a quiet mixer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quiet. Light weight. Slow speed is actually slow. No issues with power. Have had to remind my wife a couple of times that the beaters must be inserted in a specific way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-fine-i-have-2-issues-with-this-unit">It works fine. I have 2 issues with this unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works fine. I have 2 issues with this unit: 1) I find it very hard to push the eject button. I&rsquo;m getting older and don&rsquo;t have the strength in my hands like I used to which makes it hard to get the beaters out. 2) the on/off switch is meant to be used with the fingers of the hand on the handle and I have the same issue with my older hands and fingers. I have to use my other hand to turn it on or off AND to increase or decrease the speed.Other than that, it does the job.</p>

<h5 id="like-everything-else-these-days-cheapened-down">Like everything else these days, cheapened down</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yikes! Really cheaply made compared to my last KitchenAid mixer. So much less motor power, and fewer speeds. Very lightweight. I returned it.</p>
