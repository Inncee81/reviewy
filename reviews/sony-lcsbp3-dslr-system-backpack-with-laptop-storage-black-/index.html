<h5 id="great-sony-backpack-for-my-nex-vg900">Great Sony backpack for my NEX-VG900</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great back pack. I use it for my Sony NEX-VG900. The backpack has a great construction, it has a rain cover and too many space for aditional items.In my backpack I has one Sony NEX-VG900, one Sony XR550, one Rokinon Lens 85mm T1.5 Cine, one Sony lens 28-75mm T2.8 (SAL2875), one Sony A/C for the two cameras,one 160 LED light, batteries, one Sony laptop 13.1 VGN-Z890 with A/C adapter, one portable HDD and many more things. With all things it is comfortable yet.I highly recommend this Sony backpack.I uploaded some of my pictures using it with my accesories.</p>

<h5 id="first-look-at-sony-lcsbp3-backpack">First look at Sony LCSBP3 backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got it today. Went through it thoroughly. Claims are correct, it holds my SLT-A99V with SAL70400 4-5.6 G SSM II lens and Vertical Grip attached. Bag is very well made. Like the rubber feet on bottom so back sets up upright off the ground. The rain cover is accessed at bottom back of backpack. Like the left side zippered pocket, mesh pocket and flapped pocket. However, that&rsquo;s side tripod fits on so those pockets aren&rsquo;t accessible with tripod attached. There is also a deep mesh pocket on right side which is same side used to access camera without taking off the backpack (although with a large lens like the SAL70400 it&rsquo;s a bit awkward not to mention if you also have a computer in computer pouch and items in the top compartment due to weight but it can be done). That brings me to the computer compartment. Appears it will hold 15&rdquo; laptop because there is plenty room and it&rsquo;s well padded. In fact the laptop compartment will hold my 12&rdquo; laptop and my 7&rdquo; tablet even with the case on the tablet. That&rsquo;s cool. I won&rsquo;t bore you with more features because you can get that in the product specs here on Amazon or on Sony&rsquo;s website. But I will tell you I like this bag. I own a much cheaper bag like this that is ok, too but what I like most about the Sony bag is that the Velcro on the separators comes off really well with out making a lot of noise. I know it sounds petty but after tugging at the other bag this is a welcome feature. Now, there is one gripe, I don&rsquo;t understand why there&rsquo;s nowhere dedicated to stow media cards or put writing utensils that you can get at quickly. I don&rsquo;t understand this because the front bottom flap appears to have lots of room to put an external or even internal pocket to hold writing utensils even a small notebook. You might say use the left side pockets which is certainly possible if you&rsquo;re not carrying a tripod, too. This is why I&rsquo;m rating 4 stars instead of 5.</p>

<h5 id="big-sony-bag">BIG SONY BAG</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked around at alot of bags from every other brand out there. Based on a few reviews on this one&hellip;.I decided to order. I just recieved it and I can already tell you that bag is the bomb. I have room for my SLT with 70-200 attached, a speedlight (in the case) and a couple other lenses and still have some room left. In the top I have some spare batteries, flash card, a Fong diffuser. My F43 speedlight fits straight into a pocket and doesn&rsquo;t take up much space.Is it heavy with all that stuff&hellip;..yes. But if you cary a bunch of stuff any bag is going to be heavy. It has a nice handle on top to carry it that way as well. It looks good too. I don&rsquo;t carry a laptop but I have used that space with my 8x10 portfolio book to quickly show off my work to customers. I used to carry a sling style bag but this allows for much more flexibilty. I shoot youth sports and can now quickly pull out a short zoom or nifty 50, pop on a speedlight (if needed) and take some athlete portraits on the spot.</p>

<h5 id="nothing-bad-to-say-about-this-backpack">Nothing bad to say about this backpack.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love backpacks that do what you need them to do and do it well.I was using a Canon Powershot G12 for a while and my Naneu Echo sling served me very well as long as I had it. Then I upgraded to my DSLR (Nikon D5100) and eventually accrued enough lenses to warrant an upgrade. So, the hunt began. After doing loads of research I ended up landing on the Sony LCSBP3. Between the functionality, style, and price, it had everything I was looking for (and then some! a spot for a laptop, and a rain-cover? Sure, why not!)I love the ability to quickly be able to swing the pack around to my front to retrieve my camera. No more having to have the camera around my neck at all times for quick access - extremely annoying (and sometimes impossible) depending on the size of the lens you&rsquo;re using.I&rsquo;ve 3 lenses for my Nikon D5100. The 55-300MM lens, the 35MM prime lens, and the kit lens the camera came with. I&rsquo;m also able to accommodate my flash in the compartments inside the bag. The top compartment holds all of my other gear including cleaning supplies, filters, extra batteries, extra memory cards, et al.If you&rsquo;re upgrading from a P&amp;S or you&rsquo;re just now getting into the world of DSLRs then chances are this pack is big enough to haul the gear you have. Or, if you&rsquo;ve a ton of gear, I imagine this bag is big enough for you to take a long a kit that should cover most, if not all, of the shots you&rsquo;ll want to take.</p>

<h5 id="saw-this-online-had-to-have-it">saw this online&hellip;.had to have it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This backpack is SO much better than other camera packs that I have used before. It is much roomier, has multiple pockets (including the convenient laptop pocket for traveling) and I am able to store all of my camera lenses and accessories in it without a problem. ( and I have a lot of stuff!) The removable dividers are easy to use and allow me to configure the pack however I like, depending on what equipment I am taking along with me. I also like the side zipper to remove the camera without taking off the pack, and the rain cover that is attached and easily accessible. Other packs I have owned have not had the rain cover, and getting caught out in the rain was always a fear. Also, other packs I have used did not have a strap for my tripod, and I would have to strap in on the pack with something else that might work well or might not, or just carry the tripod around in my hands while hiking, etc. All in all, a great value and a very versatile pack that I am sure I will use for many years to come.</p>
