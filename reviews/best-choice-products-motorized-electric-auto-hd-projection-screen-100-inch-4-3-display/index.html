<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-screen-for-the-price">Great screen for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I unpacked it, I noticed the bar that is attached across the bottom of the screen had its right end lodged up in the main housing. If I had tried to lower the screen then only the left-hand side would have been free and the right-hand side would have stayed lodged in the housing. Fortunately, I noticed it first and was able to free it with a slight nudge from a flathead screwdriver. Other than that, the screen is incredibly nice for its price. The motor is super quiet albeit a little slow to raise/lower, but its for my &ldquo;Man Cave&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s not a big deal to me. The remote and its wall mount are a nice touch. I did notice the infamous &ldquo;smell&rdquo; on the screen but it&rsquo;s not that noticeable and it goes away after a couple of hours. All in all, I&rsquo;m very happy with the purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-and-highly-recommend">Works great and highly recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As described. Works great and highly recommend ! Built a casing around</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-be-fooled-by-the-price-this-thing-is-awesome">Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the price, this thing is awesome.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the price, this thing is awesome. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to purchase this. It&rsquo;s very quiet going up and down and can be controlled by the power cord that has a control on it, or by wireless remote.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-money-highly-recommend-this">Worth the Money! Highly Recommend this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for our regional conference room. It was larger than I really needed but the price was right and the reviews were great so I thought it was worth the risk. I was very surprised at how long the box was, I was really worried that it would be much too large. It turns out that it wasn&rsquo;t too big. Since you can adjust the length, you can cut it off short and match it to the size of your projections. I had our maintenance department install it and it took two guys about 30 minutes to put it up. I wasn&rsquo;t here when they did it but they said it was pretty easy and they started after I left for lunch and were done before I returned! There is a cord going from the screen base to the wall mount so when it&rsquo;s on the wall you can see that cord. Then there&rsquo;s a cord going from that wall mount to the outlet. I&rsquo;m not too crazy about that part but for what I paid and for the room it&rsquo;s in, it works perfectly. I didn&rsquo;t realize that it also comes with a remote and mountable holder for it. This screen works great and I&rsquo;m so happy I took a chance and purchased it! It&rsquo;s so much better than us projecting it on a dry erase board which was what they thought I was going to do!</p>

<h5 id="with-the-optoma-dlp-projecter-this-screen-is-awesome-i-ve-had-other-projection-screens-in-the-past">&hellip; with the optoma dlp projecter &amp; this screen is awesome. I&rsquo;ve had other projection screens in the past &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this screen along with the optoma dlp projecter &amp; this screen is awesome. I&rsquo;ve had other projection screens in the past but this one suppressed them all. If your considering buying this then stop the considering &amp; stop browsing for different screens, you will be very pleased with this one. The shipping said it would take three days to ship but it was sitting at my front door the following day. Real review from a real person.. Buy it. The motor is very quiet &amp; it&rsquo;s great having it in a room lit up with all Windows open. No light reflects off of it. All you see is crystal clear picture. Great buy for the money &amp; im very pleased.. Hope this review helps.. Just buy it &amp; you&rsquo;ll see how wonderful best choice products are..</p>

<h5 id="it-was-easy-to-put-up-and-i-didn-t-have-to-put">It was easy to put up and I didn&rsquo;t have to put &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So waited a month before I reviewed it but I am highly sastified. It was easy to put up and I didn&rsquo;t have to put together anything. Literally stucked on the wall and plugged it up. Don&rsquo;t bother with the instruction. I&rsquo;m not the smartest cookie so I didn&rsquo;t even attempt to understand what alien language this was. All you really need is the up and down button. Plus the thing comes with batteries!!!!! For the first time in forever, batteries are INCLUDED!!!!!! It&rsquo;s even comes with a remote carrier in case you want to stick it on the wall somewhere. Little side note. Before you start it, there is some card board in between the screen and the machine. Make sure to take it out or it will get stuck when you turn it on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="totally-worth-it">Totally Worth It</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off&hellip; great quality and customer service from the manufacture. Buy this item with confidence. Have since purchased 2 additional screens. NOTE: powercord is on the right hand side of unit. Something to consider when purchasing anything you will be mounting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-pretty-good-when-it-first-arrived-i-looked-it">it works pretty good. When it first arrived i looked it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Now that its all said and done, it works pretty good. When it first arrived i looked it over and there was a dent in the shell. I thought, eh whate and put it up, only to find it didnt work! The switch clicked but there was no movement. I took it back down(yep,1 man project) and took the end caps off. One side had been seducured on the wires, shearing them apart! I soldered the wires back together, taped them off, aand put the caps back on carefully. Now it works pretty good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-for-the-price">very nice for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We finally were able to install this screen and really like it! We ended up buying 12&rdquo; brackets so that it would actually cover the tv that sits below it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>easy to install and works great!</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>A real smooth screen makes the picture sharper, great price and value</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-power-cord-opposite-the-photo">Excellent - Power Cord Opposite the Photo.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good. Only issue is that the power cord is on the right side when facing the unit, not the left as in the picture. This was an issue as my power outlet is on the left side.</p>

<p> So far so good, I don&rsquo;t really use it but when I do family/friends are impressed.Customer Video Review</p>

<p>When I came home it was outside waiting for me lls but I like it it&rsquo;s an great item for romantic nights or family night s too</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="garbage">Garbage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the screen. Notice the GIANT sagging wrinkle, the one that takes up approx <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the screen. Wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble to hang it.</p>
