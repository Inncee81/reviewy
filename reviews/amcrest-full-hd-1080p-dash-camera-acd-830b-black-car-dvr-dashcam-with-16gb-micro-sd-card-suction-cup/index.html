<blockquote>
<p> I purchased this Amcrest Full-HD 1080p Dash Camera ACD-830B to take a look of how well SONY IMX322 image sensor and the 432MHz processor perform and the video quality. The package arrives with Amcrest ACD-830B Dash Camera, Windshield Mounting Suction Cup, Universal Car Adapter, Mini USB Cable 3 feet, User Manual, and a high speed class 10 memory card. Installation is fairly simple as car cigarette adapter is included so no hard-wring is needed. I just had to put dash cam and suction mount together. Mount them onto the windshield and connect the cigarette charger to dash cam.Device and Usage:There are several buttons on the left and right side of the dash cam and there are icons on them to label their function. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to get used to the controls as the instructions are clear in manual. It features a large 3&rdquo; display with LED indicator next to it to show activities. There is a microphone next to the lens and on the bottom for audio recording. A memory card slot on the side for extra storage up to 64GB and Mini HDMI/ Mini USB port for video/data out to other devices. There is also a GPS module port if I decide to purchase the additional GPS add-on for location.Most of camera&rsquo;s important features are ON as default so the only thing I had to do is to set the current time and date. The view angle is 160 degree.Features:Amcrest Full-HD 1080p Dash Camera ACD-830B includes most features available on market. Available recording resolutions are 1080FHD/720P/WVGA/VGS and they are smooth at 30FPS. Looping recording at 3,5,or 10 mins. Accident sensing from accelerometer and automatic recording on accident. Parking sensor and motion detection. Auto power on/off with car. Digital zoom and picture capture support. WDR for automatic harsh light compensation.PROs:- The suction mount is strong enough to hold the device in place. The device is also pretty light so it stays in place even on bumpy roads.- The video quality is quite good in day time. I can see license plate, car, street objects very well. License plate is clearly readable when moving at slower speed. At night, I found Amcrest ACD-830B does a pretty good job making objects more visible while minimizing the noise. I can see more objects in the dark comparing to other dash cams and the noise presenting in video is reasonable. I also found the WDR mode works pretty well when light condition changes. Amcrest ACD-830B compensates the light by smoothing out the adjustments instead of rapidly brightening/darkening the video. Please see my video for sample and keep in mind the video has been compressed although still decent in quality. The video is smooth at constant 30FPS.- Customer support. I have to mention this as I tried to contact Amcrest through email and they did respond me within 1 day and provided an answer to my question. I would say this is a big bonus if you&rsquo;re first time dash cam buyer as a lot of dash cam makers&rsquo; tech support isn&rsquo;t located in USA.- Strong metal frame. I couldn&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s aluminium but I like the metal frame. I accidentally dropped it on the group when opening the box and I&rsquo;m glad there was no damage.Overall I like this dash cam and it provides all the features I need. Give it a try if you&rsquo;re looking for a dash cam with a usable night time video recording.</p>

<h5 id="ready-to-use-right-out-of-the-box">Ready to use right out of the box!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is sleek and not cumbersome like other models I&rsquo;ve seen. I joked that I should use this as a regular camera as it&rsquo;s quality far exceeded my expectations! A huge perk for me, though I&rsquo;m sure it seems trivial to others, is that it included the dang mini SD card!!! I&rsquo;ve ordered other products that I didn&rsquo;t even think to consider needed a mini SD, which I didn&rsquo;t have and so I had to wait even longer to use my product :(</p>

<h5 id="small-and-has-a-nice-display-the-quality-of-the-video-is-very">small and has a nice display. the quality of the video is very &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the camera is very simple to configure, small and has a nice display. the quality of the video is very good. the only thing i had any difficulty with was locating the DVR player software which was supposed to be included according to the instructions. I had to download it but had a difficult time locating the download. instead of it being in the support section of the web page like i had expected it, it was actually located on the product description page. once it was installed, the player worked quite nicely. the gps tracking followed right along with the video playback. One thing to note is that the ONLY indication you get that the GPS is working is the little satellite icon gets a check mark next to it. there is not kind of readout on the camera screen what so ever. you have to use the DVR player to see the embedded information in the video. not a problem once i understood it though. the first thing i did was order a 64 gig memory card because the 16 gig card that came with it will only hold about 3 to 4 hours of video when the resolution is set to 720.</p>

<h5 id="has-the-right-stuff-but-lacks-in-delivery">Has the right stuff but lacks in delivery.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Video quality doesn&rsquo;t seem quite 1080p, maybe it is and there are other settings that are different that make it seem subpar. It is by no means horrible quality video but I thought it&rsquo;d be better. That aspect is quite minuscule in comparison to the functionality. The camera has a few features I &ldquo;had to have such as: accident sensor, motion sensor, parking sensor. Unfortunately, the motion sensor works when it feels like it. The parking sensor as I understand, it is able to turn on &amp; record video of your vehicle being bumped and lock the video on the sd-card&hellip;however this doesn&rsquo;t seem to work. Maybe if it is seriously struck, but I shook the car quite hard (to the point my phone on the dash slipped and fell to the floor) and it did not activate. Thankfully I haven&rsquo;t tested the accident sensor which is one of the main reasons I bought this cam. I recently had my old car totaled and realized how important it is to have proof of your side of the story. I bought an almost brand new car and am forced to park in some areas where I could be bumped or dinged (had happened a number of times to my previous car), so I was hoping this would be a good solution to ID any &ldquo;bump and run&rdquo; parking lot culprits. Overall, the camera is decent for the price-point &amp; has all the features, just maybe not of the best quality?</p>
