<h5 id="improved-build-great-toothbrush-no-buzzing">Improved build, great toothbrush, no buzzing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>According to specs, all Sonicare toothbrushes are essentially the same - they all vibrate at the same speed (31,000 strokes per minute) and can all use the wide range of available brush heads (except for the older Essence line). That is to say, they are all incredible at cleaning your teeth and if you&rsquo;ve never used one, you are in for a real treat. The difference between models is sometimes negligible, and often more than a little vague - all the bells and whistles are of dubious value. Often, the simpler the toothbrush is, the better it is - there&rsquo;s less buttons to break and less to pay for.In practice however, there are some features that may be worth paying for, but it really depends on your needs and the openness of your pocketbook. I have been through several Sonicare brushes, and the model I was using prior to this one is the 2 Series, pretty much the barest-bone model there is. I really like it, but I prefer this new HealthyWhite Plus (AKA Series 5) - not because of the buttons or features, but because I think it is actually built better. Moving to the Series 2 from the model I had before, I had noticed (as had many other people) that the brush had a loud rattle (or buzzing) when it wasn&rsquo;t in your mouth. It was a little distracting, but I honestly thought it had to do more with the brush head than the handle. However, I immediately noticed with this new brush that the buzz is almost gone - and if you look at the photo I&rsquo;ve attached you can see that the brush head sits significantly closer to the top of the handle than on the Series 2. I tried them both with a variety of brush heads, and always got the same result: the new model is much quieter. It&rsquo;s nice, but I really don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s worth twice the price.This model has a few superior features as well. It has a &ldquo;Quad-pacer&rdquo; which alerts you every 30 seconds to change to another area of your mouth. All the brushes have a 2-minute timer, and you can definitely do without the 30-second alerts, but it is nice just to note the passing time. It also uses a Lithium battery instead of the NiMH battery, which gives it three weeks between charges instead of two. Obviously that&rsquo;s better, but honestly, going two weeks is fine. This model also has three power levels and a whitening mode. Whitening is really just an extra 15-seconds of brushing that get tacked onto the end of the 2 minutes, and unless you have sensitive gums, you will probably never use the lower power settings. Philips touts this as &ldquo;6 different modes&rdquo; which is a really just the math of 3 power levels x 2 cleaning modes, and it&rsquo;s really nothing to write home about.I really like the new Diamond Clean brush head that is included with this set - but you can put any head on you like. The charger and travel case are the standard-issue Sonicare accessories and will also work with most other Sonicare brushes.Really, it&rsquo;s the better build that has locked this in as my daily toothbrush, but if I had to pay (I was provided both these brushes free for review purposes) I don&rsquo;t know if I wouldn&rsquo;t rather pay $30-$50 for the more basic model.</p>

<h5 id="keeps-breaking-battery-stops-holding-charge">Keeps breaking. Battery stops holding charge.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery stopped holding charge within 6 months of using it. Tried switching chargers and that didin&rsquo;t fix the issue. This is the 3rd one that I&rsquo;ve had to replace, same model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brush-head-is-not-securely-locked-in-place">Brush head is not securely locked in place</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just began using this Sonicare toothbrush this morning. It vibrates so strongly that the brush head comes off! Is the head supposed to click into place? It doesn&rsquo;t. I adjusted the vibrations to the lowest setting, but it still feels very insecure. I am considering returning this for an exchange. Sonicare toothbrushes are highly recommended by my dentist. I have not yet tried the Sensitive replacement brush heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-feeling-of-just-hygienist-cleaned-every-day">The Feeling of &ldquo;Just Hygienist Cleaned&rdquo; Every Day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After approximately five years the battery died on my Sonicare toothbrush. Definitely an emergency situation if there is only one in the house, but fortunately I was able to use my husband&rsquo;s for the two days it took for this new one to arrive. The difference between the way your teeth feel using a standard toothbrush and a Sonicare is like night and day. Back in the days before I owned a Sonicare I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get to my 6 months dental appointments so that my teeth would feel smooth and clean again, even though I was totally dedicated to keeping my teeth brushed and flossed. With my Sonicare my teeth feel hygienist cleaned every day, and when I leave the Dentist&rsquo;s my teeth feel the same as when I walked in. At the Dentist&rsquo;s I am referred to as &ldquo;a boring six monther&rdquo; as I present no challenge to the hygienist. Amazingly, they have told me that their job gets a little boring without a challenge here and there. Glad it isn&rsquo;t me providing it!This new brush performs perfectly like the old one and I am very pleased with it. I didn&rsquo;t weight it, but I think it may be a little lighter than the old model which is nice. I still love the 2 minute brush cycle that turns the brush off automatically so I don&rsquo;t have to think about whether I&rsquo;ve brushed long enough. Another feature I like is the small size of the brush head so that reaching behind teeth is simple and effortless. Now that I think of it, that is a good word for the entire experience of brushing my teeth with a Sonicare, &ldquo;effortless&rdquo;.I looked into some of the less expensive models before purchasing, but read that they make more noise and vibrate a lot more in your hand which I realized I can attest to as we use one on the boat. If you have been sitting on the fence and never tried a Sonicare it is worth every penny in my mind to keep your teeth feeling and looking to perfection every day of the year.</p>

<h5 id="not-the-one">Not the one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first electronic toothbrush and at first I was absolutely in love with it. However after 6 months of use, it started to malfunction in that it abruptly turns on by itself even when I&rsquo;m not using it. I thought my toothbrush was possessed so beware!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="detachable-head-will-not-stay-on">Detachable head will not stay on.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After three weeks of use I took off the detachable head to clean the toothbrush and it would not go back on. The little rubber piece fell off and prevented the head from sitting properly on the base. Pretty disappointing after such very little usage. Especially when the extra heads are not cheap.This is my first electric toothbrush and it&rsquo;s a night and day different between a regular brushing. However, it seems that the quality of Sonciare&rsquo;s products are not that great. For this price, it may be worth it to look elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buzzing-and-large-head-but-otherwise-is-great">Buzzing and large head, but otherwise is great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This toothbrush is good, however it&rsquo;s small head makes it difficult to clean every crevice consistently. Additionally, after about 6 months use, the brush started buzzing very loudly. This disruptive sound, for example, wakes up people who may be sleeping early in the morning or late at night.If there is a fix to the buzzing, please let me know.</p>
