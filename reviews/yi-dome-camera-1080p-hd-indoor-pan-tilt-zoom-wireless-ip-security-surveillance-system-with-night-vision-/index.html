<h5 id="great-purchase-a-couple-complaints">Great Purchase - A Couple Complaints</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two of these YI Dome Cameras to watch my place and my cats while I&rsquo;m at work or out of town. They were easy to setup with my smart phone. The original power cord they provide is short. If you want to mount these to your ceiling you need to buy a longer usb power cable. Consider where you&rsquo;re plugging it in and where you want to mount it. It also does not come with a micro SD memory card. You will need one for each camera if you want it to save clips and have saved alerts from each.The cameras come with minimal directions, but there is plenty of information on their app/online to help you if you get stuck. All you do is plug it in, scan from the app on your phone to connect it to your wifi and you&rsquo;re hooked up. There are settings within the app you can update (alerts, recording, etc). You do the same steps adding additional cameras. I find the app mildly difficult to navigate - sometimes it takes me a few rounds to get to what I&rsquo;m looking for.The ad on the app isn&rsquo;t bad, it&rsquo;s a full size page that comes up when you open the app that you just press &lsquo;skip&rsquo; to get to your cameras. It happens like once a day. I almost didn&rsquo;t buy them because of the complaints about the ads, but I don&rsquo;t find it hard to press &lsquo;skip&rsquo; once a day. It might happen every time you completely close the app.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is, besides the short original power cord, the picture still seems pixelated to me even though I purchased 1080p. It looks ok zoomed out, but as I zoom in on what&rsquo;s happening on the camera from the app things do get distorted. I know that happens with fixed lenses (you&rsquo;re zooming in on the image, the camera isn&rsquo;t actually zooming in), but it seems a bit low-qual for my tastes. Also my place tends to be dark, which doesn&rsquo;t help. Good lighting and close to the camera things looks great! Night vision is handy, but can also pixilate. So, in short, I can definitely see what&rsquo;s going on, it just not fine quality imagery. Good natural light is best. So not terrible but not completely satisfying in my situation.The two way audio works well. I have no qualms with it.I can move the cameras remotely back and forth and up and down to check out an entire room. Also easy-to-use.They look nice, just as pictured.Altogether a worthy purchase for what I&rsquo;m using it for.</p>

<h5 id="great-inexpensive-camera">Great Inexpensive Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great camera! Easy to set up and easy to use! Fantastic resolution.There are a couple of things that could be improved such as a white balance and brightness adjustment would be nice. It would also be nice if the camera would tilt down a bit more so that I could aim it at my pets sleeping in their beds. And it would also be nice if it automatically went to full screen when viewing the live camera image. To those who have complained about all of the permissions that the camera app requires and the apparent security issues, no problem. All you have to do is turn off the permissions that you do not want them to have. Worked fine for me. I may just have to buy another one of these once they have madea few improvements.</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great ! !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I waited to write this review as I wanted to test the camera out for a few weeks. I am now satisfied that it works fine. I placed it in my basement ceiling to keep an eye on the boiler for leaks when I am not around. The picture image is excellent day (color) or night {b&amp;w), but when you zoom in remember it is digital zoom. The night lights work great. I have no ambient light in the basement, but I can see the boiler, the floor around it and I can pan all around if I want to. You do not see any light coming from the unit hence night light. The app on my Samsung 4S works perfectly. Setup was easy and well thought out. When I tested out the movement detection, it sent a notification to my phone. Excellent ! Packaging was excellent with nice packing and a beautiful box,I will be adding another couple of cameras with an outdoor one as well. Just don&rsquo;t go crazy adding too many ! ! !</p>

<h5 id="real-time-viewing-is-great-waiting-for-them-to-fix-cloud-viewing">Real-time viewing is great. waiting for them to fix cloud viewing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will change my review from 1 star to 5 when they fix a major bug in their software. Once daylight saving time came last Sunday, the ability to record on line became corrupt. After numerous interactions with their people they escalated the issue to level 2 and told me they had a bug and didn&rsquo;t realized the bug till daylight savings time when into effect. If I change my cell phone to think it&rsquo;s in China then I can view what the cameras have recorded. But if my cell phone is in any other time zone I can&rsquo;t see what is recorded for a day or two. They said a week ago it will be fixed in the next app update. When is that going to happen? Presently the cameras are useless because telling your phone you are in China makes may other things on your phone not work properly. If you have no desire to upload what the camera has seen, then you can view in real time now, without worry.Also if you are wondering which camera has the better picture, this or the stationary camera at the same price, the stationary camera has a sharper picture. This camera does a LOT of things for the price and the picture is perfectly fine in general but the other camera is a little sharper and more clear. If you just need a camera to sit and look at a room, the other camera is the way to go, and less to break. If you need to look around from time to time, this camera for the price is a bargain, once they fix their problems.</p>
