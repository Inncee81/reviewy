<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a very early adopter of Tile, having ordered a handful of them on Kickstarter. I have since tried several other brands of thing finders (TrackR, Hiro), but keep coming back to Tile on account of the user interface in the app, the range, and the form factor. Tile really is the superior thing finder on the market right now.Tile slim works just like regular tile, only it is, well, slim. Super slim. They are not joking when they say it is as thick as two credit cards. It looks like someone ran over a regular tile with a steamroller. It is way thinner, but also a bit bigger on both sides than the regular tile. It is exactly as long as the height of a credit card.There is no hole for a keyring (this is a bit big for that), and there is a single button in the center (rather than a hidden button buried in the e).Range seems to be about identical to old tile, and time will tell on battery life.Set up is simple. Just open the app and press the plus sign in the app, press the center button on the tile, and it adds itself. That is it. Simple. Just like regular tile. It took maybe 5 seconds to set up.The finder alarm is loud enough that you can actually find what you have linked to your tile, and is simple to activate. Just go into the app, tap find it on the device you are looking for, and walk around listening.And like regular tile, this goes both ways. Press the button on the tile and your phone will start to ring.So bottom line, if you like Tile, you will like Tile Slim. I have often wished that Tile would fit in my wallet, and Tile Slim has answered that wish. My only gripe is that it would be great if it was a little longer on one side, perhaps exactly the dimensions (at least length and width, thickness is already perfect) as a credit card. It feels a bit off balance in my wallet since it is not quite as long as a credit card. So tile, if you are listening, make a credit card sized tile that fits seamlessly in a wallet. OR, make a super cool credit card holder that this securely inserts into. I would pay for that to have it not offbalance my wallet.A word of warning. Regular tile did not have a user serviceable battery. When the battery died, you had to send it in and get a replacement at a decent discount from retail price. This thinner version appears to have the same issue. Assuming battery life is similar to regular tile, you are looking at a yearly re-investment. The battery thing is why I moved away from Tile for a short period, but the reliability of Tile brought me back pretty quickly as the other products could not compete.</p>

<h5 id="partially-works">Partially works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only work from a very short distance but it will help you find what you accidentally covered you wallet with or put it in. The tracking is useless, it us often wrong even if only a few feet away it can claim it is far and vice versa. Very slim, I put mine in the bills compartment. Works with fully RFID shielded wallets (like Pagalli) since it uses a different frequency. App must be running to find you phone despite the whether it is on silent mode or not so it will run down you battery for that one occasion you need to find your phone with it. Will not work inside a metal container only plastic. leather, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="look-into-alternatives">Look into alternatives.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As you can tell from the reviews, this thing is super hit or miss. The only thing it does consistently is <em>not</em> work backgrounds. I&rsquo;ve literally never been able to use the tile to make my phone ring. I had fairly low expectations, but I bought it anyway thinking even if it only helps one time, it&rsquo;ll be worth it. That day has yet to come. If you&rsquo;re on a budget, I would recommend waiting for a better alternative or researching competitors.In case it matters, I have used it with an iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 6. All the same results aka spotty at best.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-works-as-described">Love it! Works as described.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love Tile&rsquo;s build quality and looks. Works as described. I&rsquo;ve used other tracker products such as Bravo Tracker and it is way better. Tile&rsquo;s Android and iPhone apps are smooth and are updated periodically. I had lost my keys and crowd sourcing helped find it. I highly recommend it to others. Look no further!PSS: I am adding pictures of the angles I was wondering when I was considering this to purchase, which might help you get a better understanding of Tile&rsquo;s dimensions. Hope it helps you.</p>

<h5 id="not-as-good-as-the-other-tiles-somehow">Not as good as the other Tiles, somehow.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll begin by saying that I love the Tile products and use them A LOT! I use original TIle and the Tile Mate every day, nine of them, and they make my life much more manageable. That said, however, my experience with the Slim has been terrible. I&rsquo;ve had it in my wallet for several months now and it has always only worked intermittently. More often than not it is unable to be found by the app. It seems to be always searching. It&rsquo;ll literally be sitting right next to my keys and the Tile Mate on my keys will be found and ringing within seconds of pulling up the app, I&rsquo;ll find the keys and see the wallet and the app will STILL be searching and will eventually give up. Some times it will not have communicated with my wallet for up to two weeks at a time.Today the app connected to the Tile Slim, it began to ring and as I was walking up the stairs it quit; the app had lost connection. It took another ten minutes to connect while I was searching within the same room.I don&rsquo;t know what the technical difference is between the slim and the others, and I only have the one slim, but it is just not the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-but-has-one-slight-catch">Love it, but has one slight catch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided to give the Tile Slim a try recently and so far I love it. Not only is it slim and sleek and fit perfectly in my wallet, but it is easy to set up, works exactly as expected, and the app is nicely designed.My only problem with it is that the tile can help you find your phone by clicking the button on the tile. The idea is fantastic, but the execution not so much. The tile can easily set off the alarm on my phone with just an accidental squeeze. Just keep that in mind, especially if you are in a quiet environment, you may want to take your wallet (or other item) and keep it somewhere it won&rsquo;t be accidentally pressed.Overall, I really like it, and it is a significant improvement over other similar devices that I have tried.</p>
