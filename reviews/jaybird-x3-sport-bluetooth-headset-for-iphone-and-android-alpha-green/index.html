The frame is made from sandblasted, injection-molded metal for heavy-duty durability and a sleek style that does not affect Bluetooth signal strength.

Additionally, the Comply memory foam ear tips are designed to provide maximum noise isolation and comfort. They lock in the headphone for a super secure fit, whether you’re on a calm jog or riding an MTB trail.</p>

<p>Also, the MySound app allows you to customize every aspect of your sound: from the rumbling lows to the sweetest highs! Customize every detail with the easy-to-understand interface. Compatible with iOS 9+ and Android 4.4+, your customized presets save directly onto the X3 buds, carrying them over to any music device or streaming service/app you use.

Also, the Multipoint function allows you to simultaneously pair and connect the X3 buds to two different Bluetooth devices. Listen to your music through your laptop while still answering calls on your phone with the bud controller. You can also share your music with ease, as two separate buds can connect to the same Bluetooth device, eliminating the need to share earphones. You can even connect to your smartwatch and leave your smartphone at home!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-bluetooth-headphones-compare-to-freedoms">Excellent Bluetooth headphones - compare to Freedoms</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a daily commuter and exerciser and have been relying on Jaybirds since the original Bluebuds X model. This is the third iteration of their bluetooth X-line, and it is probably the best yet, but it has made some trade-offs in the new design that are not entirely positive. Also, while I was waiting for these to be released (there was a significant delay while Logitech took over the company, I have no idea why) I got a pair of the Jaybird Freedom - their smaller model that is also available and takes advantage of the same technological improvements. If you are looking for a pair of Jaybird earbuds you need to choose between the two - they are both excellent but there are a lot of little differences to keep in mind.The actual earbuds of the X3 are about 30% smaller than the old X2&rsquo;s. Sounds good, but to call them &ldquo;helmet-friendly&rdquo; is really a bit of a stretch. They sit in your ear and don&rsquo;t protrude as much as the old model, but they do stick out - not as frankenstein-like, but they are noticeably larger than your average wired earbud. On the other hand, the Freedoms are tiny and are almost only a stem and a foam cap and will fit under any helmet, noi problem (I&rsquo;ve worn them snowboarding and biking). I have gotten so used to the Freedoms that these really seem awkwardly large. Even worse, after wearing them for a few days I started to have pain in my outer ears from where the earbud casing pressed on my skin. This is a non-issue with the Freedom.The X3&rsquo;s sound fantastic. I mean, amazing. Deep and loud and bright and I sat up in my chair when I turned them on. The Freedoms sound pretty close, but I think the X3 wins by a thin margin. Makes sense I guess, since the earbud is bigger, but the Freedom is metal while these are plastic so they are a little more solid.The big difference is the charging system - both models charge through a charging clip that attached to the remote, and both are a little wonky and awkward. The old X2 model charged directly into one of the earbuds, now you need to have the specific charge clip with you if you want to recharge - no more just using a simple micro USB cable. The upside is smaller earbuds, the downside is convenience. The X3 battery is still in the earbuds (I think) and it still gets 8 hours on a charge (I can&rsquo;t fully vouch for the that, but I&rsquo;ve never been disappointed by the battery claims). The clip is just for recharging. The Freedoms only get 4 hours on a charge BUT the charge clip is a second battery that will recharge while you are using them even (it&rsquo;s a slightly awkward, but very workable process). As a result, the remote on the Freedom contains the battery and is heavier than the remote on the X3. I think they really missed out by not make the two clips interchangeable - the remotes are almost the same shape and it would be great to be able to use either kind of charge clip.At the gym and on the go I have found the remote on the Freedoms to be almost - but not quite - too heavy. Honestly, it never pulls the earbuds out, but it does swing around a lot and I find myself using the shirt-clip to tie it down. This is not a problem with the X3 - the remote is still bigger than the old X2, but it is light and thin. I will add here that the button feel on the Freedom is superior than the shallow plasticky feel of the X3. It&rsquo;s still better than the X2.When I first got the Freedoms I was annoyed by the clip and having to schlep it around with me, but in the end I got used to it and don&rsquo;t mind the trade-off of the tiny earbuds and the extra juice if I need it. I actually have two battery clips but have never needed them but theoretically I could go for 12 hours without actually plugging them in. I was looking forward to going back to 8-hours with the X3. In practice though, the X3 kind of has the worst of both worlds. You need the clip, but it doesn&rsquo;t have a battery, so you have to also carry the attached USB cable (you can detach them or get an extra but then it is tiny and you will lose it). You also can&rsquo;t charge and listen at the same time. So, even though the battery lasts twice as long (and quick charges an hour in 15 minutes) if you think you might need to recharge it along the way this combo is more cumbersome.The other difference is really just the cable that connects the two earbuds - the Freedoms are soft, supple, and cylindrical. I worry about it constantly, but it has been fine. Actually, one developed a kink and Jaybird replaced them for me. The X3 has a flat, slightly tougher, cable. More like the X2, and pretty much tangle-free. I&rsquo;ve actually had a couple of those crack though, and Jaybird does not like to cover that under warranty. The X3 has not broken on me yet though.Both are sweat proof and pretty close to water-proof. I&rsquo;ve dropped them in the sink and pulled &lsquo;em right out with no ill effects. Both include the same pack-ins (minus the chargers) of a case, three sets of foam tips, three sets of silicone tips, earwings (i don&rsquo;t use them, the fit is fine without), and some cord shorteners and shirt alligator clip. Both have excellent bluetooth range and full-featured remotes with microphones that actually work for making calls. Both work with the Jaybird App for customizing the sound from your smartphone and both have excellent voice feedback that tells you about connections and pairing. Both also have a feature that let&rsquo;s you connect multiple Jaybird headphones to the same music device, which is pretty cool if only occasionally useful.In the end, I prefer the Freedoms for pure convenience and comfort, but the X3 are a close second with better battery life and possibly better sound. You really can&rsquo;t go wrong wither way. Enjoy the pictures&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-freedoms-on-par-with-the-jlab-epic-2s">Better than the freedoms, on par with the JLab Epic 2s!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I lost my JLab Epic 2s, and though I would move up the Jaybirds. However, as many of you reading this review might also be wondering, I questioned if it was worth the extra $20 to get the freedoms instead of the X3s. So I bought both. In short, the X3s are the way to go!Sound is better on the X3s! This is (in my own theory anyway) primarily due to the larger driver that can place in the housing so you can get better bass response. However, this is indeed larger, so it will stick out of your ears a lot more than the tiny Freedoms.Fit: X3s easily, hands down. In fact, i could not get the freedoms to stay comfortably in my ears, whereas the x3s can fit them and don&rsquo;t fall out even without the fins and using the same exact size earpiece. I would have returned the freedoms regardless.The extra charger &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; with the freedoms is pointless to me really, as it makes them heavier on one side and I would rather have a longer charge time right up front, as I supposedly do with the X3s. Plus this charge box is 1 extra part to keep track of, whearas the X3s have the charge base strapped to the USB charge cord.The cord on the X3s is flat, versus a round one on the freedoms. Not really a big deal on either, but I noted that.Both: Connecting them both to my phone was seamless and the App is actually pretty cool and well designed. Not as hokey as I thought it would be.Phone calls: Meh for both. They pick up to much traffic noise ambient sound etc, for your listener. If you want something for phone calls, get the LG HBS series headsets. These are for working out, but you can make a call in a pinch.Anyway, the X3s are better in fit (easily), better in sound (easily), and are cheaper. The only downside is they stick out a little more, but at the gym who cares. I hope this helps.NOW: As a previous owner of the JB Epic 2s, I can give you that run down as well: Epics are ALSO way better than the freedoms. So what to buy? That is a tough choice: I was not able to compare the sound side by side as i lost my Epics, but they sounded great, and so do the X3s. The Epics also fit excellent, although they are only a wrap over the ear style, whereas the X3s allow you to do both styles as you wish. The Epics also have a charge port on them any micro USB would work on, versus a required device the X3s need. They both stick out of your head just as far (maybe a slightly less for the Epics).I would say that you cant go wrong with either of these (X3s or the Epic2s), but if I were to buy again, I&rsquo;d give a slight edge to the epics due to price alone and the longer battery life.</p>

<h5 id="ios-apple-users-read">IOS / Apple USERS READ!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on Apple products (ios) there is a VERY noticeable audio delay when playing any form of video content. Lip sync is very bad, like watching old Japanese movies. These are fine for music, but don&rsquo;t plan on watching youtube videos or anything else without getting frustrated.Originally I thought I resolved the issue by uninstalling the App, I was wrong. There is no fix and there are TONS of posts about this exact same issue. I&rsquo;ve submitted multiple tickets to JayBirds support team (which have yet to respond or acknowledge anything for 2+ weeks). Their support is absolute crap. No answers or suggestions from their team from anyone asking for support on this.If you&rsquo;re not on ios, i hear that these are issueless, but if you&rsquo;re on ios DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!</p>

<p>Uncomfortable. I have smaller ears I guess because none of these eartips fit me. Bluetooth connection was bad at times with static noise. Returning it. Not worth the hype.</p>

<h5 id="best-frivolous-purchase-i-ve-ever-made">Best frivolous purchase I&rsquo;ve ever made.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Being my first pair of wireless headphones and far and away the most expensive headphones I&rsquo;ve ever bought I was understandably nervous to see how they would feel and perform.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-were-never-very-comfortable-the-worst-part">they were never very comfortable. The worst part</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointing. The fit was mediocre; even trying all the different wings and tips, they were never very comfortable. The worst part, however, was the sound quality.</p>

<h5 id="be-careful">Be careful</h5>

<p>Started off great. If I had written this a few montrhs ago, I would have rated 4 or 5 stars. Well, good thing I waited. Last week the right head piece went dead.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-the-gym">Great for the gym</h5>

<p>Jaybirds are by far the best pair of headphones I have ever owned. They are comfortable and stay in the ear even through intense cardio and weight lifting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-comfortable-and-lacking-bass">Not comfortable and lacking bass</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not comfortable and lacking bass, one of the ear tips came off inside my ear. For the price, you&rsquo;re better off buying a cheap pair of headphone with better construction.</p>

<p>These are the perfect bluetooth headphones for working out. They have a wide arrange of earpods from silicon to foam. They never fallout and have an amazing 8 hour battery life.</p>
