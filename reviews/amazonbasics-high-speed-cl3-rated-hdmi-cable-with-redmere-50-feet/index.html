<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to cabling in general, it&rsquo;s a good idea to stay away from the hype-mongers that want to sell you cables with all sorts of &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; for large amounts of money. In the past, I&rsquo;ve had very good luck with AmazonBasics products overall and I&rsquo;ve also purchased a few of their cables and have been quite satisfied.If you are just looking for a long cable to connect your 1080p HDTV to a Blu-ray player, game console, or other device, this 25-foot HDMI cable will do a fine job. However, if you are searching for a more high-end application, such as connecting a computer to a 4K TV/monitor, this is not the cable to buy.Much like a 50 foot long Bluerigger cable that I&rsquo;ve had for a few years, this is a low-priced cable that just works (when connecting a Blu-ray player to a 1080p projector or TV). The fact that it&rsquo;s CL3-rated means that you can run it through your walls and not run afoul of building codes (check your local building codes to see what applies in your area) and the cable won&rsquo;t turn into a fuse in a fire. 1080p is relatively low speed and I&rsquo;ve not run into a cable that couldn&rsquo;t do the job, but I also don&rsquo;t go for the dollar specials from companies with no name. While copper is copper, there is still something to be said for decent connectors, and unlike speaker wire, HDMI has to deal with crosstalk and other issues that too much corner-cutting can impact. I am very confident that this cable would work fine in most if not all 1080p applications. I never once had an issue in my testing at that resolution.If you&rsquo;re looking at 4K, however, you need to start paying closer attention to certifications and cable/connector construction. Higher resolution requires more speed. So do higher refresh rates. So if you&rsquo;re running 4K at 60 Hz for an application, that&rsquo;s going to require more speed to go through a cable than a 1080p signal at 30 Hz. To connect a PC to a 4K TV to use as a monitor for gaming or productivity, you&rsquo;re also going to want to be able to do 4:4:4 chroma for the best picture quality (google for more info on that).To run 4K at 60 Hz with 4:4:4 chroma, you need a cable that can handle 18 Gbps speeds, and not all cables can do that. The longer the cable, the harder it is to attain that speed, so getting a 25 foot cable to do that successfully is going to be a challenge, even for the non-generic manufacturers. On the product information for this cable, it says that it can do up to 18 Gbps, so that might lead you to believe that it&rsquo;s possible.In my testing, this cable could achieve 4K and 4:4:4 chroma, but only at 30 Hz without errors. The first cable I received was capable of doing 50-60 Hz, but with sparkles in the video and static in the audio. Given my research into the topic, this wasn&rsquo;t surprising, but since it was advertised to do so, I requested a replacement to see if it would perform better. Unfortunately, the replacement had less success, with random results of 1) video sparkles and audio static, and 2) no valid signal.As I said, this was no surprise. It&rsquo;s quite a challenge to run 18 Gbps at lengths over 12 feet. I purchased a Mediabridge ULTRA Series HDMI Cable (15 Feet) - High-Speed Supports Ethernet, 3D and Audio Return [Newest Standard] and it couldn&rsquo;t do anything better than 4K at 30 Hz at 4:4:4 chroma. Even dropping down to 4:2:2 couldn&rsquo;t get a valid signal at speeds above 30 Hz, so this AmazonBasics cable that was 10 feet longer performed better in my testing.Variances do exist between the strength of the source device and the sensitivity of the receiving device, so what can work in one situation will not work in another. If you have equipment that is running up against the tolerances of the spec, and then use a cable that is also running up against the challenges of sending an 18 Gbps signal, you can run into issues. The next person with different equipment and/or a cable that was made on a different day or with a different batch of wire may succeed. This is why it&rsquo;s important to buy high quality equipment when you&rsquo;re stretching the boundaries of what current technology can do.With all the dubious marketing claims surrounding cables, the best you can do for yourself is to find a cable that has been certified as a &ldquo;Premium Certified Cable&rdquo; by the HDMI Licensing group. That certification will be done at each length of cable, so if you&rsquo;re buying a 25-foot cable, it has to be certified at that length. A certification for a 10-foot cable doesn&rsquo;t mean anything if you need 15 or 25 feet.I was able to find just such a cable. In my research, I found that Blue Jeans Cable is one of the first companies to get that certification, so I bought a 12-foot Series FE cable (the shortest length I could use for my application) directly from the company. Only later did I find that the sell their cables here on Amazon as well: BJC Series-FE Bonded-Pair High-Speed Premium HDMI Cable with Ethernet, 12 foot, Black It even came with a holographic sticker that could be scanned to verify its certification. Granted, its price was more than twice what the other cables cost, but I wanted to make sure that I could get a successful connection, and I did. If you&rsquo;re looking for an 18 Gbps cable, don&rsquo;t waste your time with lesser quality products, and get a certified cable to begin with.Will this cable work for a vast majority of people? Yes, most likely one would never have a problem with it, because even 4K media players (like the Amazon Fire TV) do not require an 18 Gbps connection speed. At least not yet. And that&rsquo;s where you run into the issue of how to spend your money. Do you want to save money and face the possibility that you will need to replace the cable some time in the future, or do you want to spend more and not worry about it later? That answer will dictate whether this cable is the right purchase for you. My choice would be to spend the extra money and have the peace of mind that comes with it.A 3-star review seems a little harsh for a cable that will work for a vast majority of people, but it&rsquo;s advertised as an 18 Gbps cable and it couldn&rsquo;t attain that speed in my testing, even after trying two samples. I applaud Amazon for being so good about sending me a replacement cable and for taking the MediaBridge cable in return when it didn&rsquo;t work, but this product did not perform as advertised, so I can&rsquo;t give it more than a 3-star &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; rating. If it could have done 18 Gbps, I would have given it 5 stars for great performance at a great price.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed this 35-foot active (RedMere) cable in wall, and it works great, including 1080p at 60Hz &ndash; beautiful TV picture.Also installed a 35-foot passive HDMI cable in same wall, and it works equally great, including 1080p at 60Hz &ndash; beautiful TV picture (Mediabridge 91-02X-35B Ultra Series HDMI Cable - 35-Feet <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-91-02X-35B-Ultra-HDMI-Cable/dp/B009K4J8RS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494281759&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mediabridge+35+ft+hdmi">https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-91-02X-35B-Ultra-HDMI-Cable/dp/B009K4J8RS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494281759&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mediabridge+35+ft+hdmi</a>). The active cable is slightly smaller in diameter than the passive cable, if that matters to someone.So either would work, I just wanted to be cautious since getting into the wall again would require a major effort, so now I use the passive cable, with the active as backup if needed.</p>

<h5 id="great-cable-for-a-great-price">Great cable for a great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A prior 25 foot HDMI cable of unknown brand that I had installed in my wall 10 years ago, was found not to be able to support 1080p or 3D from a Blu-Ray player when I upgraded a few years ago. Fast forward 10 years, I re-installed new cabling in the wall and purchased this model of HDMI cable (Amazon Basics), which was less expensive, and yet better than the cabling I had installed 10 years prior. It worked like a charm. Now I can watch 3D movies on my 3DTV with my 3D Blu-Ray player. Thank you Amazon!</p>

<h5 id="cool">Cool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This did just what I want. I use this cable as a part of a PC to external monitor AND a PC to flat panel TV that I control with an HDMI bi-directional switch. Strangely, not all HDMI cables work in this setting. These do. My PC recognizes the change-over automatically. Other cables were &lsquo;blind&rsquo; to what I was doing, and did not change the video display setting. This DID allow the video card to recognize the switch-over automatically. Cool.</p>

<h5 id="working-perfectly-at-1080p">Working perfectly at 1080p</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed in-wall through conduit between home theater receiver and 1080p wall mounted TV. Experienced no issues pulling this cable through flexible conduit, though it is considerably thicker and a bit less flexible than most other HDMI cables I have come across (I&rsquo;m guessing this is as a result of the CL3 rating). The connection at both ends clicked in solidly and makes me feel confident that it will not wiggle or droop loose in the future. At this time, I do not have any 4k devices and such, can not speak to its compatibility and performance at any resolution above 1080p. That said, this cable seems to be supplying a flawless signal at 1080p and I have absolutely no complaints with it.</p>

<h5 id="kickass-buy-so-worth-it">Kickass Buy!!! So worth it&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 2 of these! however 1 didn&rsquo;t come with the delivery &amp; amazon got me the second cord in less then 24 hours!!! I am very impressed &amp; I live way out in the middle of the desert. These cords are HARDCORE DURABLE, VERY THICK CABLE! Very happy with the quality &amp; the customer service. Worth every penny</p>

<h5 id="crystal-clear-pic-with-this-cable">Crystal clear pic with this cable!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This HDMI cable is crystal clear with my new 4K tv. It also works well with my sound system to pass through the info and integrate all the devices in my system. I couldn&rsquo;t see paying more for a cable to do the same thing that this cable does. It is exactly as advertised and awesome.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-solution-for-25-feet">Perfect Solution for 25 feet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was told by someone that going 25&rsquo; in length would be a problem, and that I needed fiber optic cables to go that distance. I took a chance and tried these out and there is absolutely no problem with the signal to our projector. The image is perfect and I would definitely recommend this cable.</p>
