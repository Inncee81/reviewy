<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="used-camera-not-new">Used camera, not new</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera works great. Just like the first wireless camera, same model, that I bought last year. However, I thought I was buying a new camera. There is no mention of the camera being used or refurbished in the product description. I thought it was odd when I opened the box and saw that the camera packaging was torn. Also, the stickers that came with my other camera were missing from this one and this camera&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s manual had food stains. When I set up the camera I found that the previous owner&rsquo;s full name and cell phone number were still programmed into the camera. When the camera sends photos to my phone the text comes in under the previous owner&rsquo;s name. I would not have paid $287 for a used or refurbished camera. The camera works flawlessly, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="from-other-companies-and-this-camera-is-by-far-superior-first">&hellip; from other companies and this camera is by far superior. First</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had several wireless cameras from other companies and this camera is by far superior. First, the trigger speed is really fast. I have had running deer in the middle of the frame&hellip;that&rsquo;s fast! The clarity is fantastic and the website used to manage the camera is outstanding. The set up is easy to do and even a &ldquo; 60 year old&rdquo; can do it. I will be buying more of these cameras. Worth the money .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="have-realistic-expectations-and-know-your-signal-strength">Have realistic expectations and know your signal strength.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this after reading reviews and knowing it&rsquo;s limits. Yes, you need a good signal to get real time pics. I didn&rsquo;t even consider it in a low service property I have and stick with checking cards manually. I first put in medium signal area that bounces between 1-4 bars. While I didn&rsquo;t get immediate texts when I walked in front to test I did load many shots when it did get signal later in the day, including deer pics that happened after I left. A few days later I moved to a high signal area and got immediate texts as I hunted over the camera with deer walking in front of it. So I guess you need to be realistic on your expectations.As far as the website and app I&rsquo;ve gotta admit it&rsquo;s pretty nice. I can remotely change setting, can download or share pics easily, the GPS is accurate and best of all I can load data plan from website. Another brand I had made me go to the AT&amp;T store each month to reload and then explain that I only wanted a data package and they messed it up half the time.Photos are very good and just what I expected. It will be a great tool to keep me out of the woods until I see daytime buck movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">LOVE IT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical but I LOVE this camera!! We were recently robbed and we got this as a security camera. It takes great pictures with lots of detail day/night. It&rsquo;s reliable, we get text images sent directly to my phone over a cellular network, and it also loads the pics to an app you can download. LOVE this camera and will definitely be buying another in the future!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-it-s-awesome-i-have-not-had-any-false-triggers">but it&rsquo;s awesome. I have not had any false triggers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have only had it a week. but it&rsquo;s awesome. I have not had any false triggers. every pic has a animal in it I can&rsquo;t state the long term.but I&rsquo;ve used the non wireless version for two years. exact same cam just no texting i had 3 of them and never had any issues. and for the money the picture quality can&rsquo;t be beat. only thing better is a $500 reconyx.I have owned spypoint and used a friends covert and this is leaps ahead. at&amp;t is not a issue in my area. and im am getting text within a minute from the time the pic is taken. I would suggest you take a at&amp;t cell phone, to the area you plan to use it. if you have good reception on it,you should be good to go. this is a game changer. it&rsquo;s the instant text we all been waiting for.</p>

<h5 id="bought-two-for-security">Bought two for security</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two for security at my dadâ€™s ranch, canâ€™t tell you how impressed Iâ€™ve been. Pictures are high quality and havenâ€™t had issues with reception (his place is literally in the middle of no where). Will buy another one for my place</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ll-never-go-back-to-a-traditional-game-camera">I&rsquo;ll never go back to a traditional game camera.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using this camera for about a month. I am a hunter but bought it to use for security and surveillance on a new house we are building.I was under the impression that only AT&amp;T users could purchase this camera. This is not the case. The data you use comes directly from bushnell as a monthly service. True, it is AT&amp;T data but you cannot add it to your existing plan. Starting at $9.99 a month you get 1,000 downloads. I opted for the $19.99 3,000 download option.Setup was very easy and I highly recommend downloading the bushnell app as you can change the settings on the camera remotely. The camera has a &ldquo;field scan&rdquo; option which is supposed to let you view the area such as a food plot without the camera being triggered at a set period of time which you specify. I have not been able to get this option to work which is the only reason I am not giving the camera 5 stars.The picture quality is very good. GPS pinpoint was within inches of its exact location. The camera sends pictures within a minute of taking them in most cases.Overall this is a great camera with multiple uses outside of just game photos. It&rsquo;s working great as a surveillance/security camera on our construction site. We know when subs are there and can see the progress they&rsquo;ve made. This would be great for a remote piece of property where no wifi is available to keep an eye on things. As long as you have decent AT&amp;T phone reception, $9.99 a month is pretty cheap security after the initial investment in the camera.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-me">Perfect for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has been such a game changer for me! I live in Texas but my hunting property is located in Kansas, so being able to consistently check and change my cards was a real hassle before this. Now I get up to the minute updates directly to my phone! Everytime I see the Bushnell App icon notification on my phone, I get an immediate rush! Makes it very simple to know if you have deer in your spot before you head to your stand as well. Absolutely love it so far!</p>

<p>bushnell has stood behind this product , the refurbished one was sent back and exchanged / and programmed to my existing account / subscription for picture transmission.</p>
