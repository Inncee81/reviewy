Product Description
Baby kicks. Music plays. And that’s just the beginning. Movable toys on the overhead gym encourage baby to bat and grasp.

<h5 id="precrawler-entertainer">Precrawler Entertainer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m 5 months old now and it feels like I&rsquo;ve been stuck in this precrawling stage for an eternity. There you are lying on your back, staring at the ceiling, and nothing is within reach. You keep yelling at your mom or dad to play with you but all they do is stick a pacifier in your mouth or sing out-of-tune songs with made-up lyrics.Thankfully, my parents got me a toy that I can actually use.-The arch curves over my head and hangs toys at a perfect height for me to grab.-The mirror isn&rsquo;t exactly the most flattering but it gets the job done. BTW, I&rsquo;m a handsome devil.-The piano keys are difficult to reach and don&rsquo;t really make much sense to me right now but might be cool later in my life.-When I roll over, I can see the art on the pad. It&rsquo;s no Picasso, but we can&rsquo;t all be geniuses. The pad is made of quality, thick material which helps prevent my vomit from soaking into the floor. Yeah, I love my mom&rsquo;s breast milk and eat way too much of it until I vomit. So sue me.There are some negatives:-The overall durability of the toy is good as long as it is handled gently. Unfortunately, I have a couple older siblings who didn&rsquo;t get the memo. They detach the hanging toys which are only held on by C-clamps. Then they run all over the house and leave the toys everywhere. Once I start to mobilize, I&rsquo;ll be able to retrieve them, but until then, my parents have to pick them up for me all the time. It&rsquo;s probably getting a bit annoying for them.-The arch is easily detachable from the base. I wish it locked in place so my siblings couldn&rsquo;t run around the house swinging it like they are swashbuckling pirates. Seriously, grow up.Overall, this is a well-made toy that is great for precrawlers like me. Once I learn to crawl, I probably won&rsquo;t be sticking around much anymore. It&rsquo;s possible I&rsquo;ll take the hanging toys and the detachable piano with me on my adventures. If I&rsquo;m not too busy, I&rsquo;ll come back and update this review.UPDATEJan 2015 - Happy new year, everybody. I bit my tongue for the first time. Somebody really should have warned me about molars. My, it&rsquo;s a rough world out there!READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>E is 5 weeks old right not and she loves this play mat. We love that the music stimulates her. She&rsquo;s always been a kicker, and this gives her something to kick. When she cries sometimes we&rsquo;ll place her on the mat, and when she kicks the music soothes her. Now that she&rsquo;s growing she can start to reach the attached toys. This was one of the best things we invested in.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-m-really-happy-with-it">I’m really happy with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This play mat is everything and more for my daughter! I’m really happy with it. Never used one with my son so I thought I’d give it a try with my daughter. There are a lot of features on this to my surprise! It’s great for the older stages too! Right now, my daughter is 2 months old so we are using the lay and play set up but you can use it for tummy time, sit up and play and the piano even detached for them to take with them! The dangling pieces even detach. The mat is machine washable and dry on low!! You can also wash the crinkle toy. That’s a huge bonus for me! The piano takes 3 AA batteries which come with it. Highly recommended, especially for the price!READ MORE</p>

<p>My son LOVES the kick piano! We had another (expensive) playmat and he wasn’t that engaged with it. Since starting in the playmat he has rolled over and also started moving around so much more. He loves the elephant dangle toy, the crinkle tag, and especially loves the crab. He doesn’t care for the hippo, but to the hippos defense it is just hanging there while the others are more interactive. He also loves the songs. And I love that you can make them short or long. Highly recommend A+READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-piano-is-a-great-idea-but-the-gym-has-not-many-more-functions">The piano is a great idea, but the gym has not many more functions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> We bought this play mat for our 2-month old girl. It is convenient to let her play for a few minutes at a time, and she seems to get the idea that the piano keys play music, so she kicks more than usual when laying on the mat. The piano can be put horizontal, so the baby can still use it once she learns to sit. Overall, it was fun for her, although limited in the amount of interaction than it offers.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="good-toy-for-little-ones">Good toy for little ones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this for my daughter when she was 3-4 months old. She lit up when she realized that when she kicks the piano keys they make noise. That type of activity is good for developing motor skills in that stage. She liked the toys that hung from the top and she especially loved the mirror. During tummy time the pieces that hang from the rung can be hooked onto the mat to stimulate them while doing tummy time. She is seven months now and she just uses the piano as she is sitting up now. Overall it was a good purchase and she got our money&rsquo;s worth out of it.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did I wait so long. My little 4 month old LOVES this thing. I can lay him down on it and 20 minutes later, he will end up rotated 280 degrees, still playing with the toys it has attached. Right now, he does not care so much for the musical piano, but he loves being able to lay down and interact with the toys above him. My child is teething, so the little elephant toy is his favorite to nibble on while looking at the other things this mat has to offer.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="fun-for-baby-to-kick-and-swat">Fun for baby to kick and swat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like most baby toys the songs will get stuck in Your head as your baby kicks away in this toy. It is different than other kicking plays because it encourages you are baby to kick at the keys to play the abnoxious songs. My son also loves the spinny Orange toy and the crunchy circle toy that hang above it. It&rsquo;s a great thing to lay your baby in if you need to leave the Room for a second. Make sure you leave it on the ground though because putting it on the couch could-be dangerous if the baby rolls overREAD MORE</p>
