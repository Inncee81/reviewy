<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="not-very-durable">Not very durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great concept&hellip; unfortunately the plastic-type washer inside the ball (nearest the handles) wore away with deep slices in it after our first use. So the cord finds these slices (made by the cord) with every pull&hellip; therefore the ball just stops mid-way down the cord. I will try to get some replacements and perhaps the item was damaged already. The other washer on the bat side broke with the first few swings of the bat but I don&rsquo;t think that affected the movement of the ball. However, the washer closest to the handles certainly will stop the balls progress down the cord.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="piece-of-crap">Piece of crap.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The plastic grommet in the middle of the ball should be metal. The nylon rope cut through it after about 10 of use and the ball wouldn&rsquo;t go more than 5 feet after it started cutting through it. The idea behind it is perfect. But the execution of the engineering is garbage. They cut a corner to save a few cents and it made the product not worth a single dollar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-it-my-son-is-8">I absolutely LOVE IT! My son is 8</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely LOVE IT! My son is 8, and being in T-ball/baseball now for 4 years, he has gotten very good at making contact between bat and ball. It&rsquo;s at the point that last summer I stopped practicing with him in our yard because he&rsquo;s broken shutters, hit the house, hitting over the fence into a main street. We have to take him to the local park, but making time to do that is much more difficult than just running out into the backyard. So this product is a lifesaver, and a money saver! Not only can my son practice his swing in our own yard, but it saves our, and our neighbors&rsquo;, house from damage. Also, you can control the speed of the ball, so he can practice all type of pitching-scenarios. I didn&rsquo;t feel that the price was unreasonable, either. Usually products I see and feel would help my kids are ridiculously priced. So I was more than happy to order it with the &ldquo;One Click&rdquo; button Amazon offers! Thank You!!!</p>

<h5 id="good-stuff-probably-for-kids-beyond-coach-pitch">Good stuff, probably for kids beyond coach pitch.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rdquo;m working with an 8yr old and a 6 yr old and this is a bit much for them. Neither of them can pith the ball to me and it does take some skill to get the ball in the same place every time. Obviously it is not a complete replacement for an actual tossed ball but is a fun way to change things up. The quality of the gear is very good. You do get an extra string set which is likely necessary because they get twisted up pretty easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-no-the-quality-i-had-hoped">Works, but no the quality I had hoped.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The SKLZ Zip-N-Hit could be great tool to teach young ballplayers how develop a good swing. The fact that they dont need to adust to varying pitch locations allows them to focus on the path of the ball and making contact in the heart of their swing as well as develop repition in their swing to encourage peoper mechanics. I also like the fact that you can change speeds so they really have to watch the ball instead of just loading up and putting the bat out there like some do with pitchiing machines.The reason I gave it three stars is due to the quality. After the first time we used it (10,8, and 6 year olds swinging at it) one of the black pieces that is attached to the ball to let the string glide through it came off. It looks like it was glued on. While this is not affect its performace, it was disheartening to see it start to come apart after the first use! The second time we used it, the small bumpers on the hand grips that stop the ball when it is driven down the line came off. It also looked like it was glued on. The other bumper came off of the handle as well. Again, this does not affect the performace of it. I just have to (after almost every hit) readjust those bumpers back into place before we launch the next ball. It is a hassle.I rated it three stars because although it did have some asthetic problems with the pieces coming off, it is a neat concept for a hitting tool.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-set-up">easy to set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>its ok. easy to set up. simplistic form. relatively easy to use for an average adult male. my 10yo athletic son had trouble sending the ball down the line. This is in part due to his shorter wingspan. the speed of the ball is generated by the friction of the ropes when separated. A 4&rsquo; wingspan doesn&rsquo;t work as well as a 6&rsquo; does.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-concept-poor-quality">Great concept, poor quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just learned of this product last week when my son&rsquo;s LL coach used it at our first practice of the year. I thought it was great - a simple, effective way to provide accurate and consistent pitches to develop a hitter&rsquo;s hand-eye coordination. Just what my son needs!However, as I was helping the coach use this (it was brand new, out-of-the-box), I noticed that within a few hits (less than ten) the grommet that helps the ball glide along popped out. Throughout the remainder of the practice, we had to keep snapping it back into place after each hit.No big deal, I thought. It still seemed to be a very worthwhile training device. So, when I got home, I ordered my own. I figured even if the grommet on mine fell out the way the coach&rsquo;s did, a little glue would be all that was needed to fix it.Boy was I wrong!When mine arrived a few days later, my son and I went out back and set it up. On the third hit (and my son is no power-hitter!), the grommet not only popped out, it shattered into pieces beyond repair.Bottom line: The concept is great, but the quality stinks! Please, SKLZ, spend a few more pennies and manufacture this thing right!</p>

<h5 id="fun-and-serves-a-purpose">Fun and serves a purpose!</h5>

<p>This thing is great. Takes 5 seconds to put up. Kids love this and it works for different ages and heights. Teaches them to follow through with their swing.</p>
