<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-dash-mount">Perfect dash mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This car mount works perfectly! The suction is very strong my dash has a perforated texture similar to leather and it has not looosend or lost its grip. The clamp that holds the phone is very secure I have a larger phone (iPhone 7 plus) and the sizing goes from very small to very large so you can hold a variety of devices with it. I don&rsquo;t have any downsides with this dash mount. The head pivets and rotates in a wide array of direction it also turns vertically. The dash is pretty small my phone is actually slightly bigger than it. I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no question it&rsquo;s worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-built-phone-mount">Quality built phone mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a quality built phone mount. Its not too big and bulky so when I&rsquo;m not using it to hold my phone it&rsquo;s not too overbearing on the windshield. The suction cup really holds well and has that sticky touch to it without leaving anything on your finger after touching it. I drive a lot for work and find myself on many different terrains without ever having to readjust or it falling off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tai-tronics-case-mount">Tai Tronics case mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To begin with, this unit sits in my dashboard so securely, I don&rsquo;t think it will ever fall by itself. I will have to trust that you need to wash the mounting rubber in warm water to reactivate it&rsquo;s sticking power, because it hasn&rsquo;t happened so far.I keep my 5.5&rdquo; ZTE Zmax 2 horizontally for Google Maps. It sits offset, i..e. not in the centre, but it doesn&rsquo;t distract, nor move. The charger cable goes in between the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; support conveniently (to the right) with bottom referring to its &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; position.The springs that squeeze the phone in place are tight, maybe a little too tight, but not impossible to place the phone in its place. For sure it will not pop out of its place.I am extremely happy with the car mount. I will buy another one if I had another car. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-solid-phone-mount-probably-one-of-the-best">Very Solid Phone Mount - Probably One of the Best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had the older version of this and really liked it, but I sent it to college with my son. That was a sad day. After I stopped drinking, I replaced it with this one, which is equally as nice. The only knock I can think of is the pins dictate the position of the phone (the old one did not have pins), and the resulting angle may not work with all windshields. It works with my truck, but not my sports car, for example. I solved that by removing the rubber covers and pulling the pins out with pliers. Now, it works just like my old one, except it holds the windshield better. I use it to hold a Samsung Galaxy S5 in an Otterbox Commuter case. Very solid product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-unit-is-great-plain-and-simple">This unit is great, plain and simple</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After getting a new iPhone 6 Plus recently, I discovered it was too big to pop into my car&rsquo;s cupholder for navigation purposes, and decided to look for a cheap dashboard mount. This one was the most recent model of a very well-reviewed product, so I grabbed one.When I got it I was immediately a little apprehensive because of how small it is. I started wondering if my iPhone would fit and stay upright, and was pleasantly surprised when it in fact did.This unit is great, plain and simple. Well built, very stable while gripping the phone, and a large, sticky suction cup base ensures the holder doesn&rsquo;t budge at all. I drive a hatchback that sits very close to the ground, so I tested the mount out on some bumpy roads and was happy to see it didn&rsquo;t move at all.I totally recommend this TaoTronics product.P.S. You can activate an extended warranty by visiting the TaoTronics website and pasting your Amazon order number into the prompt. Not bad for $11!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-i-thought-at-first-sight">Better than I thought at first sight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a larger phone and this appeared to be too small at first but it held my phone perfectly! Used it for hands-free calling and for the Googlemaps direction app. I like it and at $10 you can&rsquo;t beat the price! I cleaned my dash with Windex, let it dry, and then applied it. Very solid and has not come off even when we had a week of 90 degrees days. I am very happy with this product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-for-a-good-price">Great product for a good price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is very sturdy! The suction cup holds really well and the phone mount swivel can be tightened to stay in any position. It grips both mine and my husband&rsquo;s phones very well even though they are both very different sizes. Can&rsquo;t beat the price either!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-get-phone-in-and-out-of-holder-i">Easy to get phone in and out of holder- I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was looking for a hands free option for when I use my phone for naviagation. I drive a Honda Odyssey and was able to put this mount on the dash with no issues. Phone is able to charge with regular Apple lighting cable while in mount cradle.Holds my phone vertically and horizontally. It was also held family members other phone models small and large, as the sizing is very adjustable. Easy to get phone in and out of holder- I couldn&rsquo;t ask for more. Met my needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-bother-with-this-one">Don&rsquo;t bother with this one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I attached this to my windshield and left it in the same spot and it worked great for about a month.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-u-til-it-didn-t">Worked u til it didn&rsquo;t</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for a few months and then it broke into pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-experience-talking-to-the-rep-was-very-very-good-keep-up-the-good-work">The experience talking to the rep was very very good. Keep up the good work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Talking to a rep was way too fast. Slow down so a person can grasp what you are saying. I know I missed a lot of what he said just because he was talking so fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-after-1-month">Broke after 1 month</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Broke after 1 month, the suction cup mechanism completely disintegrated on me one day when I was taking my phone out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-small-phones-only">Good for small phones only</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>too small, too tight, doesn&rsquo;t hold on dash or window. my phone is too heavy for unit so a phone restriction should be disclosed and kept in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-very-happy-no-longer-sticks-and-now-i-ll-have">Not very happy.. no longer sticks and now I&rsquo;ll have &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not very happy..no longer sticks and now I&rsquo;ll have to get a new one&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought it for myself and my husband stole it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="liked-it-enough-to-buy-2">Liked it enough to buy 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked these enough to buy 2 of them. You can quickly load and unload your phone into this&hellip;often with one hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-won-t-last-long">Works&hellip; but won&rsquo;t last long.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount is nice at first, it sticks well and is easy to install. It holds the phone as expected.My problem with it is that it broke less than 6 months after&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-a-short-time">Worked for a short time.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for about 3 months. I cleaned the dash surface and was initially pleased with the mount. They held my Galaxy S8 with case without a problem.</p>
