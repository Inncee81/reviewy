<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Sony α5100 Mirrorless Camera w/ 16-50mm lens
Capture that crucial moment with ultra-fast autofocusing, 179 AF points and 6 fps. This lightweight camera delivers 24.3MP of detail even in low light, and you can share photos right to your smartphone through built-in Wi-Fi. Record Full HD Video or flip over the 180° tilt screen for perfectly framed selfies.</p>

<p>Technology</p>

<p>Ultra-fast and accurate auto focus with 179 AF points and 6Fps
Snap into focus with ultra-fast 0.07 second AF (Auto Focus) speed and never miss the moment. The α5100 also realizes up to 6fps continuous shooting with AF tracking by making the most of the wide-area 179-point phase-detection AF sensor. Even when dealing with a moving subject the α5100’s superb moving-subject tracking performance ensures you get the shot during still or video capture.</p>

<p>Capture life in high resolution with 24MP APS-C sensor
You get incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements thanks to the newly developed 24.3 megapixel Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor. It’s higher resolution than most DSLRs and adopts the same gapless on-chip lens structure as the α7R for ultimate image quality and light sensitivity</p>

<p>Instant sharing via smartphone with Wi-Fi and NFC
Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to control your camera with your compatible Smartphone or Tablet. Frame an image on your smartphone’s LCD, and simply click the camera’s shutter you’re your device.  You can even transfer the images taken directly to your mobile device for quick editing and uploading - sharing has never been easier. With NFC (near field communication) - connectivity has been simplified to one-touch. Simply touch the camera to the compatible NFC enabled device to connect.</p>

<p>Record Full HD 1080/24/60P video up to 50MB/s
Make movie magic with Full HD 1920 x 1080 video in cinematic 24p, or capture fast action at incredible 60p and 60i frame-rates. Made even easier with the α5100’s 179 point AF (auto focus) system – tracking moving subjects is not a problem. Selectable in-camera – XAVC S for broadcast quality – high 50Mb/s bitrate, Blu-ray quality - AVCHD or simple and easier upload to the web - MP4 codecs are available. For serious videographers, uncompressed 8bit 4:2:2 clean-screen video files to external recording devices is possible via the HDMI connection.</p>

<p>All the quality in half the size &amp; weight of other DSLRs
The α5100 is a super compact Mirrorless camera that’s about half the size and weight of a typical DSLR, yet it has the same size APS-C sensor as most DSLRs. The interchangeable lenses and E-mount system make the α5100 more versatile than almost any other camera on the market.</p>

<p>Stunning low light photos with ISO range of 100-25600
The α5100 features high sensitivity thanks to the newly developed Exmor CMOS sensor and BIONZ X processor. You get stunning detail in in low light from ISO range 100 – 25000. And for an additional burst of light, the α5100 features a pop-up flash.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Create easy selfies with flip-up touch-screen LCD
The α5100’s tiltable LCD screen flips up 180° to make shooting self-portraits a snap. Include other people, experiment with interesting angles or shoot against famous landmarks. When you press the shutter, the camera does all the work.</p>

<p>Enhance your camera and creativity with Camera Apps
Personalize your camera by adding new features of your choice with PlayMemories Camera Apps. Find apps to fit your shooting style from portraits, detailed close-ups, sports, time lapse, motion shot and much more. Use apps that shoot, share and save photos using Wi-Fi that make it easy to control and view your camera from smartphone, and post photos directly to Facebook or backup images to the cloud without connecting to a computer.</p>

<p>Built-in pop-up flash brightens the scene
Perfect when an extra burst of light is needed to get the shot, the built-in Guide Number 6 flash1 combines with high ISO sensitivity to enable shooting in just about any setting.</p>

<p>Easy one hand use with convenient power zoom lever
A new zoom lever on the body of the camera allows for effortless one-handed operation and smooth zooming even when shooting self-portraits, bringing compact camera convenience to the realm of interchangeable-lens models. Perfect for use with Sony power zoom lenses like the SELP1650 (16-50mm), SELP18200 (18-200mm) and SELP18105G (18-105mm).</p>

<h5 id="a5100-is-worth-the-money">A5100 is worth the money!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the Sony A5100 because I am a Youtuber and I wanted to get into Vlogging. As well take awesome photos for my Facebook and Instagram without carrying my heavy DSLR. I consider the A5100 because of the mirror flip up screen. As you know beauty bloggers are professional selfie takers lol. The flip up screen allows me to make sure the lighting, angles and the focus is right.A huge addition was that the camera came with WiFi, which means I can send videos or photos taken with this camera to any device around me as long as i&rsquo;m on WiFi. which makes posting content on my social media so much easier and efficient. This particular point and shoot has some weight on it due to the lens it comes with. It&rsquo;s heavy enough to where it wont fall out of your hand but not heavy enough to where it will make your arms tired. I LOVE CANON products and buying a Sony was extreamlly hard for me but I am very happy with my purchase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a lot to like with this camera. Aspiring photographers who are ready to graduate beyond their smartphones or point and shoots will appreciate the help button feature that provides helpful tips based on shooting mode.Video creators will also like its fast focusing, the 50 megabit recording mode, and its full frame 4:2:2 uncompressed HDMI output.Image quality is excellent both for stills and video thanks to the large sensor that&rsquo;s packed inside the rather small camera body. It also incorporates plain english descriptions for each camera mode to explain exactly what it&rsquo;s about to do.But there are a few compromises. Experienced photographers might find themselves frustrated by the lack of control surfaces. With only one dial on the camera, a few button pushes are required to switch between aperture, shutter, and ISO adjustments.Video creators will be disappointed to learn that the camera cannot be operated off of external power. And charging the battery inside the camera can take as long as 5 hours. The a5100 also lacks an external microphone input.The touch screen is also problematic. Most controls don&rsquo;t take advantage of it and it&rsquo;s very difficult to see in direct sunlight.But this camera isn&rsquo;t being marketed as a pro-level piece of gear - it&rsquo;s aimed squarely at photographic newcomers who are looking to transition to a real camera. And for those consumers this is a very capable camera with attributes found in much more expensive cameras.</p>

<p>Amazing camera!! Easy to use! Stunning quality! I use it for for family pictures! Definitely recommend it! 🙌🏼</p>

<h5 id="only-usable-for-pictures-very-bad-heating-problem">Only usable for pictures Very bad heating problem.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok first things is this camera takes great pictures, but after spending so much money I found myself not using it the reason why is I am a youtuber and I could not vlog with this camera it is not meant for that and the reason why it heats up and you have to wait for it to cool off and who has time for that! another thing my new canon has is a touch screen Sony needs to get up to speed with that. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it is a nice camera just not for what I needed it. It is easy to used the flip up screen is very convenient but thats about it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The perfect camera for my makeup mavens out there! Makes skin smooth and really brings out your eye shadow and lip colors. And for my girls who follow &ldquo;Amrezy&rdquo; On instagram and wonder how her skin glows you will get that same &ldquo;glowy/smooth&rdquo; skin effect as her if you put the skin smoother option on Medium.</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-it">Very happy with it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great camera. Very pleased with it thus far. Its not quite a good as my larger Nikon, but it definitely does the trick when I&rsquo;m traveling or just don&rsquo;t want to lug a larger camera and equipment around. Its also fun to have the flip screen and touch capabilities. I would recommend this camera if your looking for something between a little point &amp; shoot camera and a professional level camera.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good portrait camera, Images come crispy and clear with absolute zero noise in most of the scenarios.Image Quality# 5/5Features[Wifi(image transfer), charging - micro USB(so you can charge it directly from power banks)] # 5/5Zoom#<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> default lenses will not do justification.Shutter Speed# 3.5/5The product I have received it looked like an open box with 2016 offer page inside, felt disappointed when you are spending 500$ plus and you get an old product. Returned the product next day. Probably will buy it directly from the store.</p>
