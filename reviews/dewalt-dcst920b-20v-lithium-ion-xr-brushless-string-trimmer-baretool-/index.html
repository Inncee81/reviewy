<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="thoroughly-impressed">Thoroughly impressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having trouble with my 11 year old gas trimmer, I was looking at some of the newer technology battery trimmers. I really wanted the 40V model after reading the reviews on here and considering I have a 1.5 acre rural lot. I decided to try the 20V model because of the price. The battery had two bars out of the box and took approximately 30 minutes to fully charge. My expectations weren&rsquo;t real high considering I had some heavy trimming to do. Well I must say I was surprised and impressed. I used the low speed mode for battery conservation, but that was really all I needed. I trimmed a lot of grass that was 12&rdquo; high and slightly damp with no trouble. After trimming all that was needed, I kept going to areas that hadn&rsquo;t been mowed yet just to see how long it would last. After I was tired of trimming the battery still had a bar left ready to keep going. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how much I had trimmed and didn&rsquo;t need another battery. I am also impressed with the Dewalt line that came with the trimmer. With all the trimming I only had to advance the line twice and probably only needed to do it once. The first time I just had to try it since I am used to using so much line with my other trimmer. This was trimming around wooden and chain link fence, concrete and rock walls as well. I am glad I didn&rsquo;t spend the extra money on the 40V now. If the battery life gets even better like everyone says, I don&rsquo;t see a need for a second battery. I would definitely recommend this trimmer. I can&rsquo;t see most residential owners needing more and even like myself with outlying areas this does the job.</p>

<h5 id="not-the-usual-dewalt-reliability-at-all">Not the usual DEWALT reliability at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Big dewalt fan but this is through and through a piece of garbage. I&rsquo;ve only used it about six times on a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> acre area (driveway / sidewalk / flower beds) and it just seized up to the point that the motor wasn&rsquo;t turning fast enough to cut a blade of grass. To top it off the 2nd time I sent it in for warranty repair they CHARGED me $50+!! The explanation is that it is a 3 year cost control warranty - not actually a 3 year guarantee.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-motor-just-went-out">The motor just went out.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The motor burned out yesterday. Luckily it is still under warranty. I took it in for repair and couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that they also had 2 other DeWalt trimmers ready to be sent out for repair. I asked them if this was a common problem and they mentioned that it was and DeWalt was replacing the entire unit. I have not had problems with any of my other DeWalt products so I will give them a break on this problem and it also sounds like they are not messing around with trying to repair the affected units. The trimmer worked amazing until it all of a sudden stopped working at high speed. I just hope that they will reset the one year warranty from the date that it is replaced.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-product">Very good product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am quite pleased with my DeWalt weed eater. It is a bit heavier than advertised in the item write-up, about 13# but I am not having any problems handling it. This was important to me since I am a 72 year old female trying to keep up with the yard work. Do wish the guard was wider to keep it from throwing things back onto my legs!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy-happy-with-the-20w">Good buy happy with the 20W</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I started with a wired electric weed wacker and switched to gas for the portability, it died a year later but I had sold the electric one at a yard sale. I bought a new more expensive gas one that lasted 4 years, then died. I then bought a $30 corded one on amazon and it was fine except the string feed required too much work to open and manually advance. The cord was no terrible but not pleasant either.Finally we saw the 40V Dewalt at the store - it was too expensive, too heavy and too long - even without the battery the weight was a problem. I use the 20V already for drills and the leaf blower, so this was a no brainer.On first use I tried running the battery down - after 15 minutes of edging I was still at 3 bars, so I decided to mow the lawn with just the string trimmer for another 10 minutes, our grass is just 20 by 80 - was able to do sweep of the entire yard and buy myself a week before &ldquo;really&rdquo; mowing with our fiskar manual mower and leave it at <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> battery. I don&rsquo;t trust the indicator - so let&rsquo;s call it <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> battery since I probably couldn&rsquo;t do 25 minutes twice on this guy. I used low the entire time.I do plan on following the manf. instruction to remove the battery when not in use and when working on the string - the trigger is easier to accidentally push because there is no plastic shield around it. I wish the shield was a little bigger at the base, but I wear goggles so not a huge issue. Assembly was a breeze. If you don&rsquo;t already have the leaf blower look around to see if you get a one battery - two device set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A good purchase overall. On &lsquo;low&rsquo; power, I can trim for about 50-60 minutes. It&rsquo;s effective for trimming high grass and basic weeds along our house, driveway and trees. On &lsquo;high&rsquo; power it will take down 12-14 inch tall heavy grass, but drains the battery much more rapidly. Not useful for anything very woody (blackberries, for example), but has enough power for basic around the yard trimming which is what I needed. I had looked at the more expensive Stihls which I&rsquo;m sure are more powerful, but this was the right blend of power and price for my light use.Battery charges rapidly and it&rsquo;s been nice not having to deal with a gas trimmer. I&rsquo;ve put probably 6 hours on it since purchase and am still using the original string provided.My only complaint is the grass guard down by the cutting string. It&rsquo;s so small as to be basically useless. You will get covered in grass using this, so be prepared (and always wear safety glasses).</p>

<h5 id="wear-your-long-britches">Wear your long britches! :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I unboxed it (it is almost completely assembled) and began using it in shorts and the debris it was slinging was tearing my legs up! Very powerful for a battery device!Also while I was using it I looked back and it was digging dirt where I had been. This thing makes quite a 12&rdquo; swath.Much, much better than my 18v Black and Decker that I had used for years. (BTW: the paperwork that came with it stated there is a three-year warranty; one year is full replacement &ndash;I did not see that on Amazon)Brushless motor seemed kind to my battery as ONE battery (not a DeWalt brand) did the entire yard.This was only my first use, but highly recommended. I will certainly repost if I find any problems over time.</p>

<h5 id="very-disappointed-in-this-dewalt-product">Very disappointed in this Dewalt product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Two years in, and the Battery discharges within two minutes. I have probably only recharged it 7-8 times in the time I&rsquo;ve had it. Very disappointed in this Dewalt product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-bit-weak">It&rsquo;s a bit weak..,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the lithium weed wacker, but 20v is a bit weak. If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of weeds, it should be fine for you. I changed out the head so I can use quick change 8&rdquo; line.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty impressed it works for me and I have a .5 acre corner lot that can get out of hand. I will say this the 1.5 and 2 AH batteries won&rsquo;t be sufficient for runtime.</p>
