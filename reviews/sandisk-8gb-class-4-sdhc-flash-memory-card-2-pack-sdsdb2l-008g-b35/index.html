<li>Compatibility: Compatible with SDHC supporting host devices</li>
<li>Designed to withstand the toughest conditions.</li>

<li><p>Speed performance rating: Class 4 (based on SD 2.0 Specification)</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The SD and SDHC memory card is a highly secure stamp-sized flash memory card, which can be used in a variety of digital products: digital music players, cellular phones, handheld PCs, digital cameras, digital video camcorders, smart phones, car navigation systems and electronic books. To support the higher capacity needs, SD cards are now requiring a different design. The new SD 2.0 specifications - which supports 4GB and up - is called Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC). The SD Association has created and defined 3 speed classes to help you identify speed and performance capabilities/minimum requirements of SDHC cards and their SDHC host products. Cards address data (read and write) at numerous speeds. Many factors impede this performance. SDHC guarantees a minimum read and write speed necessary to handle recording high quality video and audio. The maximum card speed may vary, but you can always depend on SDHC cards to meet your SDHC host product&rsquo;s high quality performance requirements. Because SDHC works differently (supports the new higher capacity cards) this new card format is not backwards compatible with legacy SD format host devices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SANDISK CARDSSanDisk sells cards in various classes. Basically, the higher the class of card, the faster the SD card saves the file (anywhere from 20 MB/second to 95 MB/second). This is important if you want to take advantage of advanced camera functions such as fast action shots, continuous burst mode and multiple frames per second, and HD video (1080p). Photos are written to your card almost instantly at the higher classes so you&rsquo;ll get your best shot, and youâ€™ll save time moving it all from your camera to your computer. If you use these camera functions with a lower class SD card, you may lose data and experience dropouts and stuttering.ABOUT THIS SANDISK CLASS 4 SD CARDSThis is a standard Class 4 SD card with write speeds of 20 MB/second. Unless you take advantage of high end camera functions, you won&rsquo;t need a higher class (i.e. more expensive) card. I have used these cards in point and shoot cameras and game/trail cameras for the better part of a decade. I have also used some other brands. However, I&rsquo;ve never had a SanDisk card malfunction like the other cards I&rsquo;ve used despite operating in below 0 degree to over 100 degrees conditions (rated to operate in conditions between -13 and 185 degrees) and running them through the washer/dryer. These standard Class 4 cards are completely compatible with cameras, laptops, tablets, and other devices that support the SDHC and SDXC formats, and are capable of recording hours of HD video (720p). These cards vary in their storage capacity (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 GB).CONCLUSIONThe best thing about these cards is that they come with a 5-year warranty. However, I doubt that you&rsquo;d ever use it. If you want quality, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with these SanDisk cards. I hope my review helps!</p>

<h5 id="sandisk-flash-memory-cards">SanDisk Flash Memory Cards</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SanDisk is the best! I use SanDisk flash memory cards exclusively with all of my electronics that require them, e.g., trail cameras and other digital cameras. I have never had a SanDisk memory card fail to work and have used them where they were exposed to temperatures ranging from 1 degree (F) to 100 degrees (F) and in the rain and snow. I have several SanDisk memory cards and use them on a daily basis. As a matter of fact, I have four trail cameras operating right now that run 24 hours a day 365 days a year.</p>

<h5 id="these-work-fine-i-had-one-go-bad-once-and-it">These work fine. I had one go bad once and it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work fine. I had one go bad once and it turned out to be a bigger deal to exchange it than it was worth, so I just view them as expendable now and go on. Maybe they work for storage, but I just use them to transport images from cameras to hard drives. They seem more reliable than I imply with the sentences above. I suspect water does not compromise them, nor does heat or cold, as far as I can tell. 8 GB holds a lot of one megapixel images. Class 4 is fast enough for several of the items that I own that I use these in (for instance they are fast enough for images from a Primos Truth Cam 35 camera (a.k.a. one type of Trail Cam), which is a type of mounted, motion sensing, day and night camera that can be left out in the elements for weeks or more).</p>

<h5 id="sandisk-has-always-been-reliable-these-cards-are-no-exception">SanDisk has always been reliable, these cards are no exception</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these cards to give to someone along with a an older Canon SX-10 IS camera I was no longer using. The recipient of the cards is happy with how they work and I have used these same cards in trail cameras with no troubles. Obviously, they are best used in cameras and devices that do not require high speed recording so if you are looking to use these on a more recent camera you should probably look at higher capacity Class 10 cards. If all you want to do is take photos they will work fine for you, and while I&rsquo;ve used them for short videos, there are better choices for not much more money.</p>

<h5 id="sd-cards-rock">SD cards rock</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a canon camcorder that is a couple years old. It has an internal.memory and slots for 2ad cards. The color on the internal memory was never right. The sub slot would not work. I could do a work around with orca but the color was still bad. I ordered an Sd card. It came in a day I told my wife she was about to hear either sounds of complete joy or of the camera smashing against the wall. It worked! Recorded perfectly. Put it in a card reader to download,made a DVD,watched the dvd. The playback was perfect. Your sd card made me have the happiest day I ever had with a computer or camera.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-a-repeat-buyer-of-this-product-and-recommend-it-for-quality">I am a repeat buyer of this product and recommend it for quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these is the 5th time I have ordered these I just filled three of the 8gb with all the CD&rsquo;s containing music so I could retrieve some wall space in my home. could not believe I got close to 400 cd on these three. the sound quality is as good as the cd&rsquo;s I have found I could place a three drawer file cabinet full of scanned papers on one and now I am looking to get more to transfer all my DVD movies onto. Scan disk has been consistent in their quality so I turn to them repeatedly. I do not hesitate to recommend them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buyer-be-warned-i-only-received-one-working-card-in-my-order">Buyer be warned. I only received one working card in my order.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Scandisk is usually amazing and I&rsquo;ve never had an issue. So I thought it odd when I got these that one work fantastically and the other was dead out of the box. Wouldn&rsquo;t read, wouldn&rsquo;t wright. I essentially paid full price for on 8G card. Which is what I needed so I just kept them. But buyer be warned. Hopefully they aren&rsquo;t all like that. But I got a lemon this time.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-great-to-have-an-inexpensive-way-to-send-3-or">it is great to have an inexpensive way to send 3 or &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In taking pictures/movies of local elementary school sporting events, it is great to have an inexpensive way to send 3 or 4 - 8 to 12 minutemovies of our friend&rsquo;s sons and or grandsons (as the case may be) and do so in a standard business envelope. Also, it is a way to passaround in my family and to their in-laws, many photos of birthdays, picnics, outings, seasonal parties, etc. Volume and cost were theprimary drivers for me and I have used SanDisk in the past. In fact, had one card split at the seam and I sent it back, addressed to the CEO,asking could he retrieve the pictures on it ? Now that took 10 months to get an answer, it was no, but they did return a 64GB card as a smallway to say, &ldquo;sorry&rdquo;. Thus, I was happy to support SanDisk with this order. Was also surprised to get this review request. What I can say forthe good of the order is that your service was prompt, complete and as ordered. Aren&rsquo;t you glad you asked ? Dan</p>
