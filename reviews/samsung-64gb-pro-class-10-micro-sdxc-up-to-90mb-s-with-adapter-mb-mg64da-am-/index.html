<blockquote>
<p>COUNTERFEIT (some of them)I purchased a 64GB Samsung PRO microSD card (Class 10) via Amazon Prime, sold by &ldquo;White Rock&rdquo; for about $50.However, I received a FAKE Samsung microSD card. Please see my attached pictures to protect yourself.1) The Samsung logo on the microSD card was very sloppy and faded. Please see comparison to genuine.2) The Read/Write speeds I tested with A1 SD Bechmark were horrific, and Atto disk benchmark was unable to complete a test without receiving write errors on the disk.3) There was a cheezy &ldquo;VIP thumbs up&rdquo; hologram on the microSD cardThanks for wasting my time. Amazon needs to do a much better time sorting the counterfeit junk out of their stock.</p>

<h5 id="fast-is-an-understatement">Fast is an understatement!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally received the card today after a long back order period on Amazon. The card is fast, much faster than the 30MB/s write spead of my original Samsung SD card.I purchased this for my Samsung S5 and so far it&rsquo;s performance has been stellar. The test results however tell me that this card is capable of read/write speeds faster than my S5 can handle so this card may be an overkill Why you ask? See my bench marking numbers below. For a non-technical summary: The card tested must faster from my computer than the speed scores when tested in the actual android device.For those who want real numbers here are the bench marks.

<h5 id="highly-recommend-this-amazing-card">Highly Recommend this Amazing Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing card for an amazing price. I purchased a full sized sd card of this same variety (samsung Pro) to use in my dslr. It worked so well that I purchased several of these micro sd card for a variety of projects that needed them. I didn&rsquo;t need a blazing fast micro sd card but I figured for a few bucks extra I can get a cutting edge card that will work well for a long time.When I got this card, I put one into my USB 3.0 memory card adapter and attached it to my USB 3.0 port. I ran some benchmarks with Crystal Disk Mark to see if the real world speeds matched the stated speeds. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. The results are as follows:All units are MB/s (megabytes per second)Sequential read/write: 91.67 / 79.54512K read/write: 78.56 / 4.2164K read/write: 5.967 / 1.5794K QD32 read/write: 6.357 / 1.629This card is amazing especially given the price. I usually go with sandisk but I&rsquo;m a Samsung fan now. For the same or even less money, you can buy a samsung card that is much faster than a good sandisk card.I&rsquo;m hoping smart phone makers and camera makers will start putting faster card slots in devices. This card is much faster than my phone is capable of using. In order to push this card to its breaking point I had to buy a USB 3.0 adapter and use it in a USB 3.0 port. I know my dslr can&rsquo;t push the card to its limit, and my cell phone won&rsquo;t either. Despite this, I still recommend you buy a card that is faster than your device because then your phone will run as fast as possible and won&rsquo;t be slowed down by the card, plus it is somewhat future proof and you can use the card again for newer phones that support faster card slots.If you buy the 16 GB card, be aware that your speeds will be somewhat slower than the 32 GB and 64 GB versions.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-high-bitrate-video-100mbit-4k-resolution">Perfect for high bitrate video (100mbit+ @ 4k resolution)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me give some background first. I owned a transcend 300x speed 32gb micro sd card (rated for writes of 20MBps). My primary use case for the microsd card is Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I store movies (1080p at good bitrates), podcasts, music, camera videos in ultra hd (4k resolution), etc.The vast majority of microsd cards can easily handle podcasts and music. The true test for good/performance/high quality micro sd cards is their read/write speed with files over 4-5gb, transferring large files without corruption, and surviving a lot of data write and erase.My Transcend 32gb 300x card was quite good for everything on my Note 3 until I rooted the phone and used a mod to increase the 4k video capture default bitrate from 48,000 kbps to 100,000 kbps (this leads to better video quality). 100,000 kbps (100mbit) requires a microsd write speed of atleast 12.5MBps (100mbit divided by 8 = 12.5MBps). The card could manage this however it was right on the edge. Also, keep in mind that this card’s real write speed is well over 12.5MBps but cell phones as of 2014 don’t use the full UHS-1 interface speed. The phone would take 10-15 seconds of “processing time” when I hit “Stop recording” on the phone after a clip that was 3-5mins long. This was due to the large file size (3-4gb) from the increased bit rate. I could still live with it but it caused me to miss out on many family moments. This scenario was going to increase as future cell phones and camcorders would have higher and higher bitrates.I purchased this Samsung pro 64 GB microsd card due to its high write speed. Mobile phones cannot get the full 80MBps+ speeds at the moment but I am getting at least 20 MBps+ which is enough for future cell phones with 150Mbit modded camera bitrates.Companies always advertise read speeds but they don’t like to mention write speeds. This card is expensive for a reason. The flash memory is high grade and exceeds the UHS-1 spec by a long margin for write speeds. I can now record 4k videos on my Note 3 at 100mbit bit rate with 1-2 seconds “Processing time” after clicking “Stop”. This is a major help since my cell phone is the primary video camera. I expect this microsd card to also help with my DSLR burst shots.Transfer speeds over micro usb 3.0 are very close to the <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>80</sub> MBps speeds listed on the packaging. This is a 5 star product and a must have for all 4k video adopters in <sup>2014</sup>&frasl;<sub>2015</sub>.D-manREAD MORE</p>
