<h5 id="best-screen-protector-for-action-cameras">Best Screen Protector for action cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I love these screen protectors. They fit perfectly and are glass and fit perfect even though the brand is not GoPro; No bubbles or anything. I definitely recommend these over the GoPro brand because of the high quality and the easiness of putting it on. It also comes with dry and wet wipes, and a wiping cloth. The price is VERY affordable for quality so this is the best substitute.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-little-kit">This is a great little kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little kit. Fits perfectly. Camera still Fits in the protective case with this kit. I have extra comfort that I won&rsquo;t drop and break my screens with these protector on them. I recommend for all action camera users.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-glass-screen-protector-fantastic-value">Quality glass screen protector, fantastic value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect fit! Quality glass screen protector, for both lens and touch screen. The lens cap is a great accessory as well. Fantastic value and well worth the money. Installation was a breeze and included cleaning cloth and stickers for removing dust.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-just-about-any-camera-and-the-best-protection-available">Great for just about any camera and the best protection available</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m as much of a supporter for this GoPro camera protection set as it is a supporter for keeping my camera in top shape. I can think of so many great things about this lens cover and no bad things. Not many things come like that. But in case the lens cover is not what you expect, the container comes with the little note to customers that if the customer is not happy the lens cover can be returned. It&rsquo;s not always easy to return a product period especially one that you&rsquo;ve taken out and is no longer in the original manufacturers layout of a package.The promise to pay back customers if they just decide that don&rsquo;t like a great product it&rsquo;s not the only thing great about this camera cover. The one thing that ties with the camera lens cover&rsquo;s easy protection of beloved and often very expensive price is the fact that it can really be used on many different cameras. The brand of camera doesn&rsquo;t spell out the size of the screen. Each brand has its own list of sizes. As long as a camera matches the size of the protection, your electronics will be protected very well. I actually do have a GoPro and it was not cheap to buy. And usually I would think that for something very expensive the good protection for it would be expensive too. But this lens cover is actually very inexpensive. That&rsquo;s another Plus.One thing that I can say from my own experience is that it really does protect your camera, and I&rsquo;m sure that every camera has a good value to its owner. My 15 month old daughter actually dropped my GoPro into the kitchen sink. The GoPro bump pretty hard into a pile of silverware that was there to be loaded into the dishwasher. I really thought that the camera would be broken. I expected that if it didn&rsquo;t actually break the camera itself it would have such a messed up screen that it would no longer take beautiful, very clear shots of any person or place or thing. My GoPro always shows everything clearly and makes for very fun replays of media. When my camera bumped into that silverware, I expected that the clarity I had had before the accident would be lost because how much could such an inexpensive thing do? It was able to protect my camera. With a good rub down of rubbing alcohol on both the screen and the lens cover that is so thoughtfully included in this package, my camera delivered a visual spectacular that was just as good as I had before the accident.I can&rsquo;t say enough about the new lens cover and Camera protection but this set of lenses provides. I hope that whatever kind of camera you have and the manor how much you paid for it, whether that&rsquo;s big or small, that you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine. Happy pictures and videos!</p>

<h5 id="installation-was-very-easy-especially-after-reading-the-manual">Installation was very easy, especially after reading the manual</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased Fixget screen protector for GoPro Hero 5 Black. Package came in a small box which contains 1 LCD screen protector, 1 lens screen protector, 1 lens cap, 1 dust absorber with 2 guide stickers, 1 cleaning cloth, 1 wet wipe and 1 dry wipe, and also instruction manual.Installation was very easy, especially after reading the manual. Both screen protectors came with a sticker for easy peeling. The dust absorber is just a sticker, which is very convenient for sticking those stubborn particles on your screen. I reused the wipes and guide stickers for installation, and the guide stickers were so helpful in aligning the screen protectors.The only downside was the cleaning cloth that came was actually full of lint, and it left more particles on my screen when used. So shake the cloth to get rid of the lint before you use it, or don&rsquo;t use it at all. The wet and dry wipes are more than enough for cleaning both the lens and the screen.</p>

<h5 id="a-picture-says-a-thousand-words">A Picture Says a Thousand Words</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently received Hero 5 Camera, as a gift, which I was thrilled with, but since I love to take pictures outdoors, My lens and view screen were constantly collecting dust. When I saw this product provided a protector screen for both, I had to try it. Although I had to call my son to bring my camera over, he borrows it frequently, while he was at my house we put the screen protectors on. They went on easily and the product came with all supplies you need to put them on for best results. As soon as we got protectors on, my Son went out into woods and began taking pictures of wildlife. When he returned, there was dust on the lens and view window but it easily came off with the cleaning cloth provided. I am extremely pleased with the product. You know you are getting something good when the Seller offers 100% Guarantee of Satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-product">Very nice product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This arrived in small 2.75&rdquo; square box. What&rsquo;s inside came to a surprise, very neatly presented. As you can see in the picture, there&rsquo;s everything needed to do the job, a alcohol swabs and dry piece of lens cloth, the lens in two separate protected pouch, guide stickers, dust absorber and a lens cap and a instruction manual was 75% useful. It skip some procedures. Anyhow, it requires a steady hand when dropping the lens in place. The guide sticker is use on the other side of the lens facing out. After you pill off the protective shield on the lens, use the accompanied guide sticker to drop it in its proper placed. The lens which I didn&rsquo;t have time to scrutinized what it&rsquo;s made off, seem rigid to the touch. I highly recommend it.</p>
