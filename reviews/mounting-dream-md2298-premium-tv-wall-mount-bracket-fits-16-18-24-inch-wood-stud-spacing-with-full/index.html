<h5 id="absolutely-one-of-the-best-tv-mounts-of-all-time">Absolutely one of the best tv mounts of all time!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this wall mount!! My Dad and I put it up using a stud finder, the stencil of the mount that actually already came with the product, a hammer, a drill and screwdrivers. It took us maybe 30-45 mins (including moving furniture from the wall, etc&hellip;) It is easy to move and tilt which is a plus. I will say, I did have to change my ceiling light to a directional ceiling light after mounting this tv since the glare from the previous ceiling light was annoying&hellip;has nothing to do with the function of this product but I just found it annoying.</p>

<h5 id="only-tv-mount-i-use">Only TV mount I use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have now installed eight of these mounts on 55” and 65” inch TV’sI am at a loss to know what more I would want in a TV mountThe key features are:One-piece long wall plate is all assembled and can be placed on the wall without the TVIncludes a cardboard template that makes it easy to predetermine approximately were and what holes you will use to mount the one-piece long wall plateScrews to mount the One-piece long wall plate to studs are included.Two brackets with the necessary screws included attach to your TV and then once attached you can pick up the TV and hang the brackets onto One-piece long wall plate easily.Two tube clips with screws lock those brackets with TV onto wall plate.A lot of extra hardware so you have the right screws and spacers.Things to watch out for:The One-piece long wall plate as delivered is too tight for moving TV once assembled. It is better to loosen the six (6) pivot bolts before mounting the long wall plate on wall (not too much about a turn and a half each. For this you will need a Hex Key Wrench Set and an open end wrench set (strange but true I found two different size nuts). Check the feel of opening the plate before installation.To mount first install the two brackets on your TV then measure from bottom of TV to top of hook on bracket . With that measurement establishing the height of the One-piece long wall plate is easy. I have observed that many people want the TV too high in a living room this will strain the neck. I position the bottom of the TV 46 inches above the floor.A bedroom is different because for two reasons you are lying in bed and occasionally one must look over a too tall belly. I position the bottom of the TV 56 inches above the floor (check for overhead clearance before mounting.Find the wood studs you plan to mount wall plate to. Use the cardboard template to determine the position of the upper left lag screw and which two elongated holes work correctly for your studs. Drill a pilot hole for the first lag screw, then with a washer on the lag screw fasten the upper left side of the wall plate about one turn loose. Use a level to position the wall plate and drill the upper right hole and use a second lag screw with washer. Recheck level; recheck distance from floor to bottom of TV (as planned). Install lag screws three and four. Tighten all lag screws. Then Hang TV then connect TVIf for some reason the set is not level this can be adjusted at this point.Remember you may have exposed wires you don’t like. Please see my review of the Datacomm 50-3338-WH-KIT Easy Mount Cable Organizer Kit and PORTER-CABLE 43218 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>-Inch Piloted Down Spiral Drywall Cutout Bit to help you with that problemGood LuckMounting to wood studs is easy.I have mounted some to metal studs using <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; X 3-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; T-Anchors - For Hollow Cavity Applications when you use this part you will need to add a lot of spacers or chase the threads further as the threads have not been chased far enough to tighten the screw. Also after you tighten screw you will probably want to cut off the excess thread.</p>

<h5 id="without-a-doubt-the-best-large-tv-mount-i-have-ever-installed">Without a doubt the best large TV mount I have ever installed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Without a doubt the best large TV mount I have ever installed. I used it to mount my JVC 65&rdquo; TV in a position where the TV would always be extended far from the mount and at an angle to the wall. In other words, the effective weight of the TV is far greater on the mount than the actual weight. It holds the TV perfectly at this rather odd distance and angle and there is no sagging. Installation was very easy and using the included paper template made it a no-brainer. This item is heavy, because it is strong and made of steel, so I had to have my wife help to hold it in place while I installed the first bolt. After that it was just a matter of installing the other 3 and lifting the TV into place. I have also purchased 2 other simpler mounts from Mounting Dream and loved them. I will never consider another brand, they are that good.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-65inch-samsung-ks8000">Great for 65inch samsung KS8000</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to install. This is my first time to install a TV mount. There is a paper template that you can tape to the wall to layout the drill holes.I installed a 65inch samsung KS8000 and the included screws are not long enough. I went to Homedepot and got 4 screws for about $5. Everything works out perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="love-it-came-with-the-wall-grid-that-u">Love it, came with the wall grid that u &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it, came with the wall grid that u can just tape up and level it out. The level it comes with is pretty basic, but if you don&rsquo;t have one of your own it&rsquo;ll get the job done. I was able to mount this up by myself with little issue. Make sure to verify your vesa size on the tv, when i looked at the brackets i didn&rsquo;t think they were going to be large enough but i was able to mount it on the very last holes. Other than that it&rsquo;s very sturdy easy to pull out.the cable management is nice and they provide velcro ties which was nice touch.</p>

<h5 id="heavy-duty-mount-handles-studs-up-to-24-inches">Heavy duty mount handles studs up to 24 inches</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this mount to handle a 60 inch sharp TV over a fireplace. The studs were at 24 inches, so I had to look for a mount that would handle this size TV and could handle the 24 inch studs. This one fit the bill. It&rsquo;s very sturdy, and I felt confident after the TV was installed on the wall that it was solidly mounted to the wall, and that I could tilt and angle the TV as much as I like. The kit included many washers in adapters to handle a variety of TV&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-wall-mount-for-someone-with-a-larger-tv-and-longer-wall-stud-spacing">The perfect wall mount for someone with a larger TV and longer wall stud spacing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great wall mount! I had originally ordered a different wall mount, but discovered that it would only work for 16&rdquo; stud spacing. This mount solved that problem perfectly because it works for 24&rdquo; studs also. It&rsquo;s a little bit stiff when moving it, which is exactly what you should want. No one wants their wall mount to move too easily. Adjusting the tilt and bracket position is very simple. The one thing that was slightly concerning was the size of the lag bolts used to secure the mount to the wall. I felt like I was going to split the studs while tightening them, but they held up. The included 6&rsquo; HDMI cable is durable braided nylon. I&rsquo;m not sure how well the cable management system works because I&rsquo;ve not used it yet. Overall, you can&rsquo;t beat this product! If you have 16&rdquo; stud spacing then there are more competitive options, but if you have 24&rdquo; like I did, there&rsquo;s no doubt this is the best option. It&rsquo;s cheaper than other mounts that are similar and well worth every penny.</p>
