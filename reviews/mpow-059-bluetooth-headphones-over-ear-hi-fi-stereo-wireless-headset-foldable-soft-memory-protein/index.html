<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<ul>
<li>IMPRESSIVE SOUND QUALITY IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL &amp; PLEASE NOTE: 1. This item is passive noise isolating, NOT active noise cancellation(ANC), it can&rsquo;t cancel the noise completely but it won&rsquo;t drain the battery and damage the sound. As an additional factor of sound quality, it is better than ANC. 2. The closed-back design provides immersive Hi-Fi sound with CSR chip and 40mm driver together. If you care more about Noise Cancellation than Sound Quality, you may consider other alternatives.</li>
<li>BUILT TO STAY COMFORTABLE: The Memory-protein ear cushion simulate human skin texture, ensuring lasting comfort. The stainless steel slider and softly padded headband allows you to find the perfect fit without constraint and provide excellent durability.</li>
<li>NEVER POWER OFF, BOTH WIRELESS &amp; WIRED: 1. The wireless mode: A built-in 420mAh battery provides up to 13-hr music time/15-hr talking time in a single charge; 2. The Wired mode: you can also use it as a wired headphone with the provided audio cable so the headphones will never power off.</li>
<li>HANDS-FREE CALL &amp; BUILT-IN MIC: Please Note: The Microphone only works in the wireless mode. Mpow Bluetooth headphones provide a quick and stable connection with your Bluetooth enabled devices like cell phones, tablets, pc, TVs within 33 feet, with a high-quality built-in microphone for hands-free calls.</li>

<li><p>FOLDABLE DESIGN WITH A PORTABLE BAG &amp; GENTLE REMINDER : The foldable Headband is not only designed for saving your desk space but for carrying in the provided bag. Gentle Reminder: Depending on your head/ear size/shape, it may be a little tight(feels like“on ear”) for someone to wear which is designed to avoid sound leakage. In case of that and to get both audio and wearing comfort, please take off the headphone every 1-2 hrs to get your ears relax and protect them from muggy environment in use.</p>

<h5 id="video-review-awesome-bang-for-your-buck-folds-up-compact-decent-quality-and-they-look-awesome">Video review: Awesome bang for your buck. Folds up compact, decent quality, and they look awesome.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Video review: Yes, they work with glasses!Decent bang for your buck. If you listen closely there&rsquo;s a bit of &lsquo;fuzz&rsquo; noise, but that is drowned out once the music/video starts playing.These are the BEST headphones I&rsquo;ve tested (and I&rsquo;ve tested a lot) when it comes to latency&ndash;that is there&rsquo;s no delay when viewing a video on my iPhone and the audio that&rsquo;s playing.Note: There&rsquo;s quite a delay when pressing Siri. Like a good 3-4 seconds before she&rsquo;s &lsquo;activated.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Mic doesn&rsquo;t work properly. Others can barely hear my voice.Update 04/06/2017:Customer service did pretty good job and fast, by contacting me about the issue I had. They even re-order a new one for me, now everything is work perfect as I expected. Thank you and keep up the Good work.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-for-budget-headphones">Great Sound for Budget Headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed these MPow Bluetooth Headphones, especially for the price. At an entry level price, you get good sound and long battery life. It doesn&rsquo;t have the really deep bass like some other headphones do, but they offer decent balanced sound. If you wear them for more than an hour, it could start to hurt your ears if you have larger ears. If you use the bluetooth feature, make sure you either turn your headphones or phone volume all the way up to maximize your volume. With one turned all the way up then you can control the volume with the other device.They pair really fast with an iPhone 6S Plus and they have audio cues to let you know what mode the headphones are in.Making a call was clear, but having my voice muffled by the over-the-ear style headphones isn&rsquo;t ideal for me, so I probably wouldn&rsquo;t use them for long calls.While they don&rsquo;t have active noise cancellation, they do a good job at keeping background noise out because of the style.</p>

<h5 id="wear-them-daily">Wear them Daily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: comfortable on my large head. No headphone has ever covered my ears without hard places or sweaty or too tight. These are good for hours2. Battery seems to last many hours. Lost track3. Pairs easily with my moto G 4 phone and also a BT transmitter connected to my Chrome TV dongle. Easily xfer back and forth4. Clean, rich sound. Nice break from my ear buds.5. Build quality acceptable for this price. Soft earpads and padded cross support. Buttons gave solid response. Ear cups are flat enough to lay head on pillow to watch TV.6. Adjustable enough to find perfect comfort position.7. Good volume and surround and noise rejectionCons: none. We&rsquo;ll see how they hold up to long daily useUpdate 9/30/2017 I wear these for several hours each day. Holding up well. Battery still holds good long charge. I added moleskin to the earpads to make them a little more comfortable. Ear holes could be a tad bigger for my head and ears. Overall still the best headphones I have owned.</p>

<h5 id="great-headphones-for-the-price">great headphones for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife took over my $300 head phones so I needed to find something that was ok and won&rsquo;t break the bank. These headphones sound just as good as my $300 set for the most part. They aren&rsquo;t as strong in the bass but they still hold their own as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.They are very comfortable over my ears and are easly adjustable also the battery seems to last long enough for me before I need to recharge.They are not noise canceling but do block out enough outside sound that I can forget the world around me and enjoy my music.Now the only problem I have is she want&rsquo;s these and says I can have my old headphones back&hellip;.go figure ;)</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-value-for-bluetooth-headphones-foldable-wired-and-wireless-good-build-quality">Very nice value for bluetooth headphones (foldable / wired AND wireless / good build quality)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Need a nice value bluetooth headphones with durability, good sound quality, &amp; can be wireless OR wired? This MPOW headphone is it!*Unit Operational Test*This is a pretty simple unit to test. I started with testing fitment / adjustment to my head using the sliders (stainless steel sliders, nicely done!) while also testing the ability for folding the headphones (worked great, very solid feeling). The memory foam ear cushions and along the inside of the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very comfortable with good spring in the foam. It is an attractive set of headphones, good use of contrast red, silver, and black. The device is touted to NOT be active noise canceling so we&rsquo;ll test passive noise reduction with the over-the-ears cushions.The device has user controls on one side (power, volume up, volume down, track forward, track reverse, play / pause) on the right-ear side. My Test: 1) Turn on the Headphones &hellip; you&rsquo;ll heard a clear voice &lsquo;Power On&rsquo; message. 2) Turn on Bluetooth on your phone and pair the MPOW headphones / connect. 3) Start up your preferred music or audio smartphone app. 4) Operate the headphones (connected and streaming from your BT-enabled phone) for 10 hours continuous streaming and wired mode (using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable) along with conducting a test phone call. Then power off the headphones.I used my primary phone, a new Nexus 6P as my initial test. I turned on the headphones (the headphones provide an initial&rdquo;powering on&rdquo; along withe a &ldquo;not paired&rdquo; audio cue), then paired the device and connected by phone using Bluetooth (yet another audio cue &ldquo;phone 1 connected&rdquo;). I next started up one of the music apps. Eureka, it works!. Sound quality is quite good especially at this price (little emphasis in the mid-band imo). I can confirm no active noise cancellation but with the nature of the ear cushions I did experience reduce ambient noise when the headphones were on and in use. Sound can get LOUD but yet clear (no distortion nor crackling), which is nice to see. You won&rsquo;t get thumping base or highs, but that&rsquo;s to be expected.I next disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to test wired connection using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable that was supplied by MPOW to connect to my phone&rsquo;s headphone jack. The MPOW worked well in wired mode! Very handle to have both wired and wireless modes. I lastly powered off the headphones (nice touch for an audio &ldquo;powered off&rdquo; confirmation cue).My next test was to make 2 phone calls (one to my home landline phone and one to my cellular voicemail). Calls were very clear and quite loud (with the headphone volume turned all the way up), and everyone could hear me fine using the built-in mic. This test completed successfully as well.*Recharging*The MPOW Bluetooth Headphones offers built-in rechargable battery (420 mAH) that is rated to last up to 13 hours of continuous music time or 15 hours of talking time. I&rsquo;ve done a test with the headphones running while streaming music using bluetooth, my test ended after 10 hours and it was still running! That&rsquo;s more than enough run-time for me.I tested recharging as well using the micro-usb port (found on the same side as the user controls). You&rsquo;ll see a red led light come on.. It took me several hours for a full recharge after using for 10 hours straight in my music playback test.*Build Quality*Very solidly built device. Not in the same league materials-wise as Bose but also not in the same price range. Good use of sturdy plastics, memory foam as the ear cushion, stainless steel for the adjustable sliders. The unit&rsquo;s folding capability also worked well, very solid feeling along the hinges. Good fit and finish overall.*Conclusion*This MPOW Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear delivers in what they said this device could do. It connects seamlessly to your BT-enabled phone and can play streamed audio but also can accept a wired connection (no battery charge needed in wired mode!), the headphone design is foldable (great for travel &amp; storage in general). It&rsquo;s a solidly-built and comfortable-to-wear device. Mpow offers a 45-day money back guarantee and a 18-month worry-free guarantee as well (I&rsquo;ve not yet needed to take advantage on the other Mpow items I&rsquo;ve bought in the past, all are working great). I would happily recommend these headphones to friends and family, especially for the value &amp; flexibility to use in wireless or wired mode.Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headset, Foldable, Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs, w/ Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/ Cell Phones/ TV</p>
