<h5 id="with-fewer-frills-would-be-a-5-star-camera">With fewer frills would be a 5 star camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Long gone are the days where I had to lug a DSLR, multiple lenses and flashes in order to get good photos for clients. (I serve the construction market.) Enthusiast-level cameras do a great job and this one cost a fraction of what I spent on my last lens. While many clients are content with the photos they get from their iPhones, that&rsquo;s not what I want to deliver. In order to provide the quality I believe differentiates my services I need the control of a DSLR but I want the the compact size, low cost, and light weight of a great point-and-shoot.Here&rsquo;s what I love about this camera:&gt;The ability to shoot shutter priority, aperture priority, full manual, or full auto (with consistently good results in auto)&gt;Fast, quiet autofocus and zoom&gt;Tilt and swivel touch-screen monitor&gt;Very good 4k video&gt;A decent built-in, variable-output flash and a hotshoe&gt;The ability to shoot RAW&gt;A decent built-in mic and a jack (the sound quality is very good with the built-in mic although production audio rarely makes it to the finish)&gt;Quick cold starts and near-zero latency on the shutterThe only thing I truly dislike is the thumbwheel focus. It&rsquo;s slow, badly placed, makes pull focus and follow focus nearly impossible (although the auto follow focus does a good job), and after a half-century of shooting I can&rsquo;t stop reaching for the barrel of the lens.I also wish they&rsquo;d allocated costs differently. For some reason makers of enthusiast-level cameras think they need to pack their products with features that I find useless. Maybe their market demands these gimmicks but I hate &lsquo;em. Scene modes. Color balance. Drive modes. Then they slather on buttons and menus so that, in theory, you can access and manipulate all these options. I find them a hindrance. I wish they&rsquo;d spent their money on a faster lens, a larger sensor, and better dynamic range. Overall I like this camera a lot and it will serve my commercial and personal needs very well. But it could be better, much better, with fewer frills. I&rsquo;ve included some images from when I was first playing with the camera. The food shot from Patti&rsquo;s 1880s Settlement in Grand Rivers KY was shot at f2.8, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>, ISO 3200, no flash, in Intelligent Auto. The shot of Cave Run Lake (KY) was at f4, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>320</sub>, ISO 100, Intelligent Auto. The picture of the church in downtown Kingsport, TN was shot at f2.8, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, ISO 4000 in Intelligent Auto.</p>

<h5 id="fz300-a-fantastic-camera-that-is-a-huge-upgrade-to-the-panasonic-fz200">FZ300, A Fantastic Camera that is a huge upgrade to the Panasonic FZ200</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it&rsquo;s limitations discouraging. She didn&rsquo;t want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it&rsquo;s a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasionShe likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it&rsquo;s performance, I kept hearing , &ldquo;I love this camera&rdquo;, . &ldquo;I love this camera&rdquo;. . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail. I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special1. The camera has an excellent grip, it feels good in the hands. Easy to use.2. Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ2003. Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!4. Great zoom range. From 25 to 6005. EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better6. Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera7. Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.8. Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light9. Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.23. Good quality macro images possible.What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.3. Could use a headphone jack for video.4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won&rsquo;t replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it&rsquo;s own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it&rsquo;s the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you, consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</p>

<h5 id="very-pleased-with-the-photos">Very Pleased with the Photos!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it could have a larger sensor, higher MP, or be one of those &gt;40x zoom cameras, but I&rsquo;m happy with the photos it takes. Even at full zoom and in a variety of lighting, it takes awesome photos. Haven&rsquo;t had a blurry or grainy one yet. Even without a tripod I was able to take an amazingly detailed photo of the full moon. And even with morning fog, the photos came out sharp! I continue to be impressed by this camera&rsquo;s ruggedness against the elements: most of my photography is at the beach (read: sand, salt, and saltwater spray), and it&rsquo;s held up so far and seems to be well built to endure.</p>
