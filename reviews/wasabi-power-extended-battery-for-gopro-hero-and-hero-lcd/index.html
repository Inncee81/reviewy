<h5 id="great-battery-great-price-much-needed-accessory">Great Battery, Great Price, Much Needed Accessory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery arrived quickly as usual for an Amazon transaction. It was a perfect fit for my GoPro. It has multiple indicator lights to show the level of charge, I really like that feature. It charged quickly off my laptop which was important for me because I use my GoPro on a race car and there is rarely an available outlet to plug in a charger. I like the fact that with the extended recording time, I did not need to recharge at all at the race track, the battery lasted all day. We used it 30 minutes on the track, then 30 minutes off while the car was being refueled and prepped, then back out on the track. We repeated that scenario 3 times in the morning then 3 times after lunch. Other guys at the track had other brands of extended batteries and half of them had dead batteries each day by mid afternoon. My Wasabi lasted all day each day. There is a separate power button on the battery, so you have the option of using the GoPro battery first, then turning on the Wasabi battery. I don&rsquo;t know it that gives longer battery performance or not, I just turned on the GoPro and the Wasabi at the same time and recorded. My only gripe is not with Wasabi, but with GoPro. Their documentation is pathetic. They presume that the consumer knows too much about their product and they leave out important basic information. I noticed on GoPro&rsquo;s website that many people had the same questions about basic information that should have been in the user&rsquo;s guide but was left out. I had a glitch where the camera would not turn OFF when the Wasabi was attached, so I simply removed the battery then powered down the GoPro. That is a GoPro issue, not the battery. I also found some of the menu&rsquo;s on the GoPro were difficult to navigate. 4 other guys with GoPro cameras tried helping me and they also had trouble navigating the menus on my camera as well, so it was not my lack of comprehension; it was poor documentation from GoPro. One piece of advice, when recharging the battery, slow charging via a USB on a laptop is generally better than a quick charger plugged into an outlet or car. Quick chargers can overheat a battery and damage it quickly.</p>

<h5 id="learn-to-use-it">Learn to use it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Wasabi Extended Battery works great when you learn how to use it. I first thought I received a defective battery because it would stay on when attached to my fully charged Gopro causing it to get very hot, after troubleshooting with Amazon I was sent out a replacement which also did the same thing. The lack of instructions didn&rsquo;t help, so after messing with them I figured out that one must hold the power button on the Wasabi Battery to turn it off. If not it stays on causing you to use both batteries at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-worth-it">Well worth it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing product! I thought I was going to have to wait until the battery charged my camera before I could use it again but I just plugged it in and and my camera was ready to go! Plus it made it very convenient that it came with a water proof casing so my that portion of my camera was not compromised by adding the Wassabi Power Extended Battery.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-flawless-so-far">Good product, flawless so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good with this product, definitely give a whole lot more shoot time then the stock battery that came with the camera. The seal on the battery overlay seems to fight as snugly as the stock cover and fits in well. One thing that was difficult was removing the pin from the old rear seal of the device to replace it with this one. Once you have it started it is much easier but the initial starting takes a very small punch and some steady hands. Seems to charge fully in a few hours from any outlet that supports the USB.Overall a nice product that we hope to get a number of hours of use out of. I am looking forward to its cold weather life as we do a great deal in the winter months that we will be using it for.</p>

<h5 id="the-batteries-both-charged-up-fine-and-fit-as-they-are-supposed-to">The batteries both charged up fine and fit as they are supposed to</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries both charged up fine and fit as they are supposed to. I have not had a chance to put them to the test yet to see how much more batter life they will end up giving me, but I believe they will do the job. The extended case cover provided to fit over the battery while it is on the GoPro was easy to install and seems to work well. The batteries weigh less than I thought they would, this is a pleasant surprise because I was worried about the GoPro being to heavy for certain mounts due to the extra weight but I don&rsquo;t believe that will be a problem.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-battery-not-too-crazy-about-the-charging-light">Excellent battery. Not too crazy about the charging light &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent battery. Not too crazy about the charging light system. I also noticed that real battery only takes portion of the body space. However, this battery works great for close to 3 hour underwater diving. Very happy!</p>

<h5 id="great-add-on-for-hero-lcd">Great add-on for Hero+ LCD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is used as a second battery pack or you could charge your internal battery with this. Great add-on for Hero+ LCD. Just remember it will cover the LCD when applied.</p>
