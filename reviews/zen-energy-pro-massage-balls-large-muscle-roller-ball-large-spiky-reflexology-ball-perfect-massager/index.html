<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-for-sore-muscles-and-tired-feet">Good for sore muscles and tired feet!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have attempted to use tennis balls, racquet balls, golf balls, and a couple of massage balls in the past, but none have been either the right size or firmness to be useful to me. These massage balls feel sooo good on on tight upper back and low-neck muscles.I like the blue prickly ball the most for sore glutes and hamstrings, you can really feel the increased blood flow to the area when you use it on the bigger muscle groups.My favorite use for both of them, though, is on my feet! They are the perfect size that they don&rsquo;t roll away when I am rolling my feet out on them, and the firmness of the red ball feels especially good on my feet after standing at work all day!A nice little added feature is the bag that they come in, because I am less likely to lose them.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-price-for-good-function">Excellent price for good function</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was super excited to come home and find these in the mail! Like many other reviews here, I also practice Brazilian Jiujitsu. I also pole dance and shoot archery. My body is all kinds of sore, all the time!These rubber balls are great and sturdy. As described, these balls are natural rubber which to me, is always a plus. I like that they are eco-friendly. I recently started learning more about myofascial massage and release, which I&rsquo;m very new to. One of my instructors had to explain all about it. So this was a good product to start with, in addition to my normal foam roller, also from Epitomie.Personally, I have already been using a spiky ball as a foot roller. This one is equal in competition although I did not find it particularly better or worse. I love it. I roll about 10 minutes every night per foot. My feet have never been happier. My parents remarked that they would use it for body massages too, but I can&rsquo;t bring myself to try it yet. Just the smooth ball for body massage. I use the large massager on my back most of all. I&rsquo;ve tried it on my leg but I mostly just use a foam roller for my legs.Let me tell you - it DEFINITELY gets deep tissue massage going!!! Try it! If you do it consistently, it relaxes your muscles and helps untangle the knots in your body. WORTH IT.Good product for a great price. I will be purchasing more for christmas gifts!</p>

<h5 id="i-like-to-call-these-massage-balls-fire-and-ice-due">I like to call these massage balls &ldquo;fire and ice&rdquo; due &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like to call these massage balls &ldquo;fire and ice&rdquo; due to the way they feel on your skin. Youre probably asking, &ldquo;is it warm and cold&rdquo; and the answer to that is no. If you use these balls properly it can be a great way to remove trouble spots on your body.I have a disc issue in my neck, and i rub these 2 balls in the troublesome area and next thing you know my issues are relieved, temporarily of course.I suggest you use the balls the following way, use the spikey balls first, get the skin nice and red and dig in there for a few minutes then move to the smoother non spikey ball, hence fire and ice. You will feel a serious relaxing sensation, these balls are absolutely wonderful!Thanks again Epitomie Fitness!</p>

<h5 id="the-right-tool-for-the-job">The right tool for the job!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>66 yrs old, full time surfer, ex gymnast, ex full contact fighter, .. so for me it&rsquo;s all about releasing muscle trigger points. Using a ball works but it seemed various balls were not the right size or tension so results were hit and miss. The Zen balls are perfect!!! I can get a spasm to release in seconds! The knobby ball is evil but effective, &hellip;. really fantastic for getting difficult places to release. Their support team answered pre purchase questions quickly and even a minor question more to do with amazon was answered almost immediately. It&rsquo;s just a ball right? More like the right tool for the job!!!</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-perfect-for-the-gym-bag">Absolutely Perfect for the Gym Bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I struggle with a very tight piriformis that is almost debilitating at times.I stretch a good bit and also use a foam roller which helps but the roller will just not get deep enough to release the piriformis tightness. I stretch a good bit and also use a foam roller which helps . Also use a tennis ball, softball and baseball.The tennis ball is too small and flexes too much. Softball is too big and hard as with the baseball. I have had these Pro Massage Balls for over a week now and my condition has slowly improved to the point that I am back running with pain. The round ball is a little over <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch more in diameter than a tennis ball and much firmer but does have a little give to it. The size is perfect for getting into the piriformis muscle. I am able to lay down, cross my affected leg over and insert the round ball into the piriformis area. I do this for 30 seconds, relax for a minute, then 30 seconds three times a day. The spiky ball works great for rolling around between the spine and shoulder blade for a knot that I get. Overall, I am so pleased with this product and would recommend anyone with piriformis issues give them a try. A;ways in my gym bag. Great Product</p>

<h5 id="the-blue-one-is-easily-compressible-with-flexible-projections-for-people-who-enjoy-more">The blue one is easily compressible with flexible projections for people who enjoy more &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Within a simple carrying case, are two types of massage balls. They are both about the same size. The blue one is easily compressible with flexible projections for people who enjoy more direct tissue release. The red ball is solid, noncompressible and has mild heft to it which I like. I use these primarily to roll out my plantar fascia at the end of the day while at the computer at home or while brushing my teeth. I&rsquo;ve noticed an immediate difference and will probably continue to use the red ball (my personal preference).Object was provided at discount for review.</p>
