<blockquote>
<p>I did not know how ridiculous this plan works until I personally called their service desk for answers to my questions, and I can tell you if you just want to flush your money in the toilet then, that is the protection plan you want. Now read between these lines: 1) This plan covers ONLY if there is an electrical surge to your product in question. Now here is my two sense question. What&rsquo;s the odds for electrical lightening to hit your place and looks for you insured device so that you can claim for insurance? Now that is a fruit for thought.Again. If incase you happened to be the unfortunate one and your product got hit by Lightening, your &ldquo;asurion protection plan &rdquo; will Not and I repeat will Not give you a replacement. You have to send it to their accredited technician shop on your cost for the technician to access it. Therefore for the longest period while your product is under investigation with their technician you&rsquo;re up to the creek without peddle if you understand what that phrase means then please my advice to you. DO YOUR HOME WORK and read between the lines. Don&rsquo;t do it. It is a money grabber scheme, rather give your money to the poor, you&rsquo;ll be bless for it. Don&rsquo;t let them sock you in!</p>

<h5 id="be-asur-ion-not-to-purchase-this-plan">Be &ldquo;Asur&rsquo;ion&rdquo; Not To Purchase This Plan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Asurion was &ldquo;sure&rdquo; fast to cancel my plan, and actually &ldquo;reassured&rdquo; me the &ldquo;assured&rdquo; protection they offered was no longer valid. What?! Tried logging into my already created Asurion account to check some details. Account closed! I can&rsquo;t even access my account, let alone claim a warranty. Lol. But all is well, a lesson well learned. At least I wasn&rsquo;t out of pocket for a very large amount, and it was a one-time buy in.Would not recommend purchasing this product protection plan. Also, rest assured, nearly all products come with a manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.Sometimes, most of us are so excited and we want the best protection for our newly purchased items, we forget about the already existing warranty offered by the manufacture. Which is sometimes easier than the alternative.But please don&rsquo;t solely look at my situation, and think that all protection plans are bad. A prime example would be; once, I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time. Qualified for a 2% interest loan on my 2014 Subaru Forester 2.0XT, Touring Edition. A $35,000 flagship SUV. The dealer was offering a never-heard-of service warranty plan. Lifetime! Say what?Yes, it&rsquo;s a verifiable truth. Please forgive me if I sound arrogant, or as if I&rsquo;m boasting. But the vehicle recently had some major service work performed, at no cost. Service bill well into the thousands of dollars. Car is great, but already with 98k miles, parts needed to be replaced. However, the warranty company fixed everything, and even paid for my rental car.Another example; the original manufacture warranty replaced a $7000 transmission, because a technician misdiagnosed a noise around the front end. The cost and repair was so large, the regional manager had to visit the dealership, and sign off on the work.Now that was a protection plan worth buying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware">BEWARE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never purchase this again. Their protection X number of years INCLUDES the manufacturers one year &lsquo;built in&rsquo; warranty. SO, divide your &lsquo;extended warranty&rsquo; after you subtract the built in manufacturers warranty.They INSTANTLY screw you out of one year.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worthless">Worthless</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I tried to use the plan, it told me my warranty was still in effect and they denied me. My warranty was for 3 years and this was for 2. I wasted my money because they won&rsquo;t even cover it and it will expire before the manufacturers warranty does. They say not to buy extended warranties, I know why now. Never again.</p>
