<h5 id="works-fine-while-it-lasts">Works fine&hellip;while it lasts.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have several video game consoles, satellite receiver, blu-ray player, and a roku box so I need to use an HDMI switch. I used one of these cables as the output from the box to the tv and it couldn&rsquo;t handle it. Constant black screen flicker. So I used them betweeen the devices hooked directly into the back of the tv. The first one, hooked to my Dish Hopper, worked fine for about two weeks, then died. The second, hooked to my Roku 4, worked fine for an additional two weeks, then died. I troubleshooted the problem by swapping inputs and cables with the same devices. Twisted Veins cables have failed me for the second time. Ended up going with MediaBridge or BlueRigger cables. Picture and sound looked fine until they failed.</p>

<h5 id="sleek-looking-cables-that-provide-an-excellent-bang-for-you-buck">Sleek looking cables that provide an excellent bang for you buck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is always my go to brand when buying HDMI cords. Included is a few twisty ties to keep your cables from becoming a tangled mess along with a 90 degree adapter for those hard to reach connections. In my book this is the best bang for your buck when it comes to HDMI cords. I have never had one crap out on my and ive been using them for years now. The nylon braided cables give them a sturdy feel and they are as cheap as the plain black china ones that are broken right out of the box half the time. NEVER EVER BUY HDMI FROM A RETAILER STORE. They will charge you LITERALLY over 10x the price for the same thing!!!! That is insanity and here is an exampleMy aunt and uncle are not tech savy and got a Blu-ray player this past Christmas from best buy. I was over setting it up and thats when i saw the receipt. The employee upsold them on a single 6ft HDMI cable that cost $80&hellip;. That&rsquo;s right, EIGHTY DOLLARS. I told them to pack it up and bring it right back and immediately ordered them a 2 pack of these for about $10. Great product that I would recommend to anyone</p>

<h5 id="excellent-cable-well-worth-the-money-and-it-ll-be-hard-to-find-as-nice-a-set-for-less-money-anywhere">Excellent cable well worth the money and it&rsquo;ll be hard to find as nice a set for less money anywhere</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really nice HDMI cables. I needed to replace the one I lost for our 48&rdquo; TV when we moved and I was not going to pay the over inflated price for similar cables in the local stores. I generally buy all my electronics from electronics wholesale parts houses for the best prices. None could beat the price for similar cable like these. I even tried one of the big on line cheap cable places I use. None as nice as these for twice the cost. These have a nice heavy, yet flexible, cable and come with a 90 degree adapter and cable ties. The adapter alone costs more than the price of these 2 cables here on Amazon. If you need an HDMI cable these are the ones to get. One to use and a spare &ndash; or share the extra one with a friend who needs one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-low-price-work-great-extras-included">High Quality, Low Price, Work Great, Extras Included</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These cables are a great buy. At the time I was looking for a long HDMI cable I liked the price and color. They feel heavy duty with a nylon like braided sheath. The braid is stiff, not soft cloth-like, which might be an issue for some people. It works fine for me. I have not tried this with 4K content yet. No distortion or sparkles in my picture.I was happy to find that at the low price of these cables the company threw in extras such as a right angle adapter and cable wraps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="liberated-me-from-the-apps-on-my-smart-tv">Liberated me from the apps on my &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, for very little money I can play my Lenovo laptop through my Sony Bravia HD TV and my home theater, which means I have access to all the world of Internet based free audio and video, and Hulu, without having to remote my way through the clunky apps built into the television.Seriously, if you got a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV, chances are you&rsquo;ve got a dedicated computer input connection, and the next &ldquo;smart&rdquo; thing to do might be to get a nice inexpensive laptop to take the place of those apps that came with the TV, since most of those apps just duplicate what&rsquo;s out there on web sites, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, etc, and keyboards and mice are way easier to deal with than TV remotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="both-cables-bad">Both cables bad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tried both cables connecting to a DVD player. Both had static going in and out. One was worse than the other. Switched to the old cable, which was too short for my needs and it worked fine. Tried again and the same results. Both cables are bad. I did get a 90 degree adapter, little LED light and cloth for cleaning TV, but they don&rsquo;t mean much when the cables don&rsquo;t work.Seller was very helpful and has excellent customer service. They sent two more 15 ft cables thinking the two I received were defective. However the new cables did the same thing. When they learned that I was still having problems they sent me two 25ft cables because they are a thicker gauge. They worked great. Their 15ft cables are the same gauges as their smaller length cables. At 25 ft they use a thicker gauge cable. So in my case the 15 ft cables did not work on my DVD player. However they did work on my cable box. I would give their customer service 5 stars. But until they use the thicker gauge for their 15ft cable I can not recommend their 15ft cables.</p>

<h5 id="great-hdmi-cables">GREAT HDMI CABLES!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great HDMI Cables! They work perfectly. I used to work in Electrical, Electronic &amp; Cable R&amp;D-Manufacturing. These are well made cables. Great design and function. The HDMI 90 adaptor and mini LED Key Ring Work light really come in handy too. Very well packaged and product info. Wish I had found them a year ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-value-works-perfectly">Excellent value, works perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While these cables are not exactly supple, they work flawlessly and look premium. Previously, I had a bad HDMI cable kill the HDMI decoder on my Epson projector. After killing the HDMI decoder on a second projector, I tossed the cable and bought these. Great price, super value.</p>
