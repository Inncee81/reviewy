<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product, using with my Play:1 speakers. Hides the cords well and looks very nice. Only one complaint. The stand comes with 3 mounting brackets (one for Play:1, one for Play:3 horizontal and one for Play:3 vertical). I&rsquo;m planning to save and upgrade to Play:3 speakers for the rear of my surround setup. Unfortunately the stand only comes with one felt pad for attaching between the mounting brackets and the speaker, so it&rsquo;s a one and done and then you&rsquo;ll have shop for more parts if you want to switch to a different speaker or orientation. With the two extra felt pads this would be indisputably complete and in my opinion the best option for pillar mounting Sonos speakers.Update: Sanus reached out to provide me with the felt pads I needed. The pads arrived very quickly and are exactly what I needed. Thanks so much, excellent product and service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-stand-but-better-directions-needed">Excellent Stand but Better Directions Needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice product and fits the SONOS Play 1 well. It would have rated 5 stars, but the directions need to be a little better. Another review references the plastic collars and the danger of sliding them into place too soon instead of leaving them in the middle of the extension pole until you&rsquo;re ready. That is advice well heeded, and had I not seen that review, I would have had a similarly frustrating experience. (I&rsquo;d also recommend putting the rubber floor skids on the base before doing ANYTHING if you&rsquo;re working on or above a wood or laminate floor. The base is heavy by necessity and will scratch a pliable surface without the skids in place.) Other than the directions needing a little tweaking, the Sanus Speaker Stand is a quality piece of equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-solid-well-built-stand-for-a-play-3-speaker">A solid, well-built stand for a PLAY:3 speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This speaker stand does what it claims to do and does it well. It is well-constructed out of solid materials, and the design pays attention to isolation of the speaker so it does not transmit vibrations to the stand or the floor. I used a pair of these stands with PLAY:3 speakers in vertical orientation, and assembly was straight-forward. As others have noted, the plastic collars fit rather tightly on the shaft &ndash; a little lubrication makes them easier to position. The assembly instructions, though wordless, are quite clear, and the hardware for each step of the assembly is in its own plastic pouch with a number keyed to the instructions.I expect to buy these again when I extend my audio system into another room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-and-assembly">GREAT PRODUCT AND ASSEMBLY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG - I am so impressed about this product, its documentation, and packaging. I really HATE assembling products. But I was amazed how easy and well labelled was every step of the process. Also, all the products were protected with plastic so as not to scratch and to easily identify. The first stand took longer to assemble as I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect. The second stand was assembled in 10 minutes. The speaker stand works for both the PLAY1 and PLAY3. I have the PLAY1 and they are very sturdy. I was able to get rid of some furniture at my small place.So far, I love it. I recommend this item. I do not know how to upload a photo from my computer to my iphone so sorry.. no pic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="saves-shelf-table-space-but-requires-floor-space">Saves shelf/table space, but requires floor space</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these for my bedroom because I wanted to reclaim the surface area my two Sonos 3 &ldquo;rear channel&rdquo; speakers were taking up on the dual nightstands. The speakers are now mounted vertically on each stand and sitting in opposite corners against the back wall angling toward the bed. The stands are pretty large actually, particularly at the base. So be mindful of the dimensions when considering. Common sense. Also be aware that the power cables that are shipped with Sonos speakers are not terribly long. Of course that, and the location of the outlets, will limit your placement options unless you use an extension cord. Again, common sense. They work fine. And look pretty good, too. Very stable (won&rsquo;t be easy to tip over) and sturdy.</p>

<h5 id="after-several-purchases-of-other-speaker-stands-this-is-the-best-one-by-far">After several purchases of other speaker stands this is the BEST one by far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a one of the nicest speaker stands. After several purchases of other speaker stands this is the BEST one by far!!! I like how it hides the cords and is very sturdy. I have the SONOS PLAY 3 on it and it looks great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-of-these-stands-for-sonos-play-1-s-and-love-them-not-difficult-to-assemble">&hellip; 3 of these stands for Sonos Play 1&rsquo;s and love them. Not difficult to assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have 3 of these stands for Sonos Play 1&rsquo;s and love them. Not difficult to assemble, but follow directions. Don&rsquo;t assume you know how to assemble.They take up little floor space, are heavy enough so a bump won&rsquo;t topple them. Can be easily moved around if needed. Look very sleek! Recommended them to other family members.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-exactly-a-quick-assembly-but-a-nice-product">Not exactly a quick assembly&hellip;. but a nice product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received my stands and put them together. Overall the quality is good and the materials are substantial. Two things kept me from rating these 5 stars. One, the product description does not list the overall height at 34&rdquo; which would have been good to know since they are a little tall for what I was looking for. Second, the plastic sleeves that cover the pole to the plates were supposed to &ldquo;slide&rdquo; on. They were so tight, I had to literally use a hair dryer to soften them just to get them on. It made the &ldquo;installs in minutes&rdquo; a much longer challenge. Other than that, it&rsquo;s a great, solid product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-it">BUY IT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Buy this! My Sonos 1 fit perfectly. 5 min assembly, good quality. Looks great, wires are all hidden. Well designed and constructed.BUT IT</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stands">Great stands!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are great speak stand for the Play 1. Bought two to place behind couch for surround (play bar and sub). Look great, easy to assemble, fast shipping, and great quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked like a charm. Easy to setup and looks good. Good materials, it is sturdy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-assemble">Easy to assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to assemble, looks good ( especially w Sonos speakers ) and sturdy. I have several because of these features.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-so-easy-my-8-year-old-can-do-it-and-they">its so easy my 8 year old can do it and they &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this product is a no brainer. i have NO IDEA how people managed to break or crack these when assembling. its so easy my 8 year old can do it and they look amazing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-easy-to-put-together-and-works-well-w-the-speakers">but easy to put together and works well w/ the speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Footprint is bigger than I anticipated, but easy to put together and works well w/ the speakers. One word of caution is the plastic caps on top and bottom of pole crack easily&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sonos-stands">Great Sonos Stands</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very simple, but great product. I don&rsquo;t normally leave reviews, but I think these stands are perfect for the Sonos 1&rsquo;s and 3&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>
