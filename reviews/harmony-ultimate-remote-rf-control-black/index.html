<h5 id="love-it-works-exactly-as-expected">Love it. Works exactly as expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 5th Harmony remote over the last 15 years. This upgrade was my first with bluetooth and RF remote so that I could close the doors on our new A/V center cabinet. Usually, I dread having to set these up. Loads of to and from the USB cable and clumsy web app to get it right. However, this one was up and running in minutes. Its more intricate with more functionality, yet was easier to setup. The phone app makes a huge difference and you no longer need that awful USB connection for updates.I have the hub inside my cabinet and the IR blaster above for the TV. It works extremely well. Never have my devices missed a signal. Even with 3 shelves that almost touch the inside of the door when closed, each device on each shelf detects the IR signal from the hub sitting on the middle shelf. The intensity of the signal is enough to bounce off the inside of the wooden doors!My Harmony hub is now also attached to Alexa and I have voice control for activation and switching functions. Perfect for ending the night and going to bed. Simply say &ldquo;Alexa, turn off the TV&rdquo;. And everything, TV, Amp, DirecTV etc all turn off. Boom.Buy it. Worth it.</p>

<h5 id="finally-we-have-only-one-remote">Finally&hellip;we have only one remote.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, 3rd try over the last 7-8 years&hellip;finally, we have one remote control in our family room. Every time we tried before there was always SOMETHING missing. One didn&rsquo;t work with Apple TV. Another didn&rsquo;t work with Roku, didn&rsquo;t work right changing settings on reciever&hellip;etc. We haven&rsquo;t touched another remote control in the 3 months we&rsquo;ve had this.Easy integration with every device we had, easy one button changes between TV (cable), Roku, Pandora, AppleTV, anything. Bonus is that the App for Android or IOS is very good too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this remote. I&rsquo;ve owned several Harmony remotes over the years. They all fall short on the placement of some buttons, or the size and shape of the remotes, you can never satisfy everyone on these factors. That being said, I think the design is excellent. The fit is good in my hand. The screen is easy to read and use. I do think the placement of the shuttle controls shouldn&rsquo;t have been above the touch screen and the DVR button is too low. However, that&rsquo;s just me personally, others may like this arrangement.Where this remote shines is the ease of setup, the hub which integrates IR, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and RF(limited), and the ability to use smart phones and tablets.An unexpected bonus, I was able to integrate this remote with my home control system via a new plugin (Vera 3, Mi Casa Verde) and now I can condition lighting and other scenes based on activities. I can also send commands directly to the hub from the control system.I&rsquo;m still waiting on Logitech to release the Harmony Hub Extender, which will offer Z-wave and ZigBee control directly for lighting and other control, but my Harmony/Vera solution is working well.After a firmware update, it provided excellent access to my SONOS music system, including cover images on the remote screen.After purchasing this remote, I see Logitech has released the Ultimate Home line series. I hope they don&rsquo;t do like they have done in the past and never fully develop this product and only move forward with the newest version. The price is too high for that. I ran into that in the past with the 1000 and then the subsequent release of the 1100.All and all, this is a very capable remote. Even at this price, it is a great deal for a fully configurable remote that doesn&rsquo;t have to be maintained and configured by some dealer. When you notice something you want to change, you can configure it then and there.</p>

<h5 id="one-remote-for-all-your-devices">One remote for all your devices.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I always hated when setting up a new remote you had to go through 50 different codes to get one right. With the advances in technology now you have to enter the Model Number, which is great if you buy all of your electronics through Amazon and go through your order history. Otherwise you have to find a magnifying glass and the back of the equipment without unplugging your device.With that being said I was able to find all of my devices and enter them in the computer desktop software (There is also mobile apps for iphone and android), the setup was quick and painless. Even my Verizon/Frontier DVR was located and the channels programmed into the remote. The only issue is I have difficulty getting the Yamaha receiver to turn on and off, which could be because of the placement of the hub remote locators.So far everything is working.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="freezes-and-can-t-stop-it">Freezes and can&rsquo;t stop it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen is too sensitive so you can not hold or operate it with one hand. The RF feature requires wires coming out of the cabinet to sit in front of your IR devices&rsquo; sensor. Not easy or pretty when you got your tv on the wall. Set up is hard and confusing.It needs more space between the edge and the screen so your fingers don&rsquo;t touch the screen simple holding it. It has a totally round bottom so you almost have to set it upside down to keep it steady on your armrest. Online set up is easy to confuse with all the other ways to set it up. They don&rsquo;t seem to sync because the only place I could locate mine was on the desktop app. Not for amateurs as the ads would suggest. I sent it back with the screen still &ldquo;shutting down your activity&rdquo; as it had been running for an hour. No way to shut it off. Non-responsive to any inputs. Try this item at your own risk.</p>

<h5 id="i-think-this-went-about-a-smoothly-as-anyone-can-expect">I think this went about a smoothly as anyone can expect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this went about a smoothly as anyone can expect. I researched my devices on the logitech website before I purchased to make sure they were supported. After the remote arrived, I followed the very simple instructions which included powering on the hub and attaching the remote to my computer (iMac). The software helped get the hub on my WiFi network then guided me through adding devices and (pretty smoothly, easily) setting up activities. I added &ldquo;Watch TV&rdquo;, &ldquo;Watch Movie&rdquo;, &ldquo;Watch Roku&rdquo;, &ldquo;Watch Apple TV&rdquo; and &ldquo;Listen to Music&rdquo;. After the remote was setup I placed the hub and IR blasters so my devices could receive signals (most equipment behind walls in closet). I pressed &ldquo;Watch TV&rdquo; on the remote and everything came up as advertised. Nice!</p>
