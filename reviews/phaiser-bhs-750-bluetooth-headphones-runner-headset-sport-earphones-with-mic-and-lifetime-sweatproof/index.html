Look No Further - These Bluetooth Earbuds Have It All!</p>

<p>The Newest Technology
No More Choppy playback, weak batteries, dropped phone calls… Not all Bluetooth headsets are created equal! Bluetooth 4.1 increases Battery Life dramatically while letting you travel further than ever before.</p>

<p>The Highest Audio Quality
The BHS-750 uses the highest quality transducers and hardware, as well as Bluetooth 4.1, and A2DP stereo transfer protocols. That means bigger bass, lighter-than-air treble, and perfect phone call clarity EVERY time.</p>

<p>The Most Revolutionary Toughness
We designed the BHS-750 so that it can withstand even the toughest environments. The earbuds are made with Aviation Grade Aluminum-Magnesium-Alloy which doesn’t add weight. Thanks to LiquipelTM Nano-Coating the BHS-750 can be dropped into water and will live to see another day! (not for swimming)</p>

<h5 id="pretty-sure-these-saved-my-job">Pretty sure these saved my job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are my first set of wireless headphones so I didn&rsquo;t much idea of what to expect. I finally made the switch after realizing that the iPhone 7&rsquo;s design made it impossible to listen with their plugs and charge, and if you&rsquo;re streaming on a non-wifi connection as I do at work, it sucks a lot of battery life. I just kinda read an exorbitant amount of reviews and decided these were the pair for me because a) magnets! I love them. I have no shame for love of them. b) accoutrements. I am a sucker for accessorizing my accessories. Do I what all that stuff is for? Hell no! Do I care? Hell no! Life is all about choices, and I like my headphones to be able to enjoy the little pleasures of choices just as I do. C) the fact that comply tips were part of previously mentioned accoutrements. Another thing about my work is that they don&rsquo;t allow those huge (and effective) noise blocking headphones. My office unfortunately is also peopled by a multitude of individuals who like to stand RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR CUBIE WALLS AND SCREAM ABOUT THE INANITIES OF THEIR LIVES. Add to that an extreme case of misophonia and a dude who likes to clips his nails at his desk, and we&rsquo;ve got a perfect storm of things that make me wanna burn things to the ground. These comply tips are the best at outside noise blocking aside from actual foam earplugs. D) the carrying case is super solid and nice. E) the sound quality is great compared my old plugs. F) they fit perfectly. I&rsquo;m not a big runner/person who enjoys sweating, but if I found myself running for my life and needed a soundtrack to go along, these wouldn&rsquo;t be budging.These are a great price and I love them. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would buy again and have already recommended to my friends.</p>

<h5 id="750-s-better-than-the-730-s">750&rsquo;s better than the 730&rsquo;s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the new BHS-750&rsquo;s. Right now, the vast majority of reviews are for the older 730&rsquo;s. So far, I like everything about these ear buds. There seem to be several improvements in the new design. They are smaller in length so they don&rsquo;t stick out of your ears as much. There is an LED on the controls which is red when charging and blue when fully charged. The USB jack is now located in the control module. It appears that the ear buds are angled rather than straight and make pushing the buds in to your ears easier. Other than these improvements, I think these 750&rsquo;s are every bit as good as the older design.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-earbuds-they-fit-great-love-them">Awesome earbuds!! They fit great!! Love them!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying theses earbuds! I was surprised with all the ear inserts that were included in the package. There&rsquo;s a variety of pieces to accommodate each ear size and shape. I really like the former fitted foam ones that came with it. They&rsquo;re really comfortable! As far as sound quality goes, they sound is really good except for the bass. It&rsquo;s a little on the low side. But after installing a sound equalizer on the phone, it really improved it a lot! The batteries last a pretty long time. I got a good six hours out of them, before needing to be charged. The quality is pretty good. Fit and finish is nice, and I really like the magnetic ends that clip together around your neck when not in use. The really keep the earbuds from flopping around. All in all, I&rsquo;m REALLY happy with my purchase!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what you get for the price is well worth it and more. Many options in terms of clip and, nubs for your ears to customize the right fit. Word of warning though if you have multiple devices running on bluetooth. If you pair these headphones with them when you first turn them on you will hear nothing but connected coming over as its literally connecting to all the devices at once. Which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing if your doing a Skype call on your tablet and have music going on your laptop. Sound quality is good, it does what it needs to do. If your looking for a good pair of headphones for the gym, or just taking walks or whatever these are great. My only gripe was I saw the 760&rsquo;s after ordering these which are cheaper, but overall I enjoy them. It is nice working out and not having to worry about your arm snagging the cord while running, or when your lifting to have the headphones cord flail in your face or yanked out because your bluetooth device fell off the bench.</p>

<h5 id="first-the-good-the-sound-is-very-good-at-least-for-my-ears-no-audiophile-and">First the good- The sound is very good (at least for my ears - no audiophile) and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had these earbuds for a little over a week and have used them a couple times. First the good- The sound is very good (at least for my ears - no audiophile) and the controls work well. I&rsquo;ve listened to books as well as music and have been very pleased with the sound and the volume. As for fit, I am still playing around with the correct setup. I&rsquo;ve worn them for about two hours and they are comfortable for the most part. They do stay in my ears very well and have not had any issue of them coming out or feeling like I needed to adjust them. I&rsquo;m sure once I can find the correct combination they will be great. As a side note, I also purchased Bluetooth earbuds made by AADDON. These are also very nice stay in my ears like the BHS-750 but they fit really nicely right out of the box and don&rsquo;t have the wings. Equal sound for both sets. I really like both sets. I will update once these get broken in and I have a chance to use them for a longer period.</p>
