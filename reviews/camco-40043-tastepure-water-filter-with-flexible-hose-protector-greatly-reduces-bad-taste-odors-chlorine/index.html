<h5 id="awesome-filter-nasty-campground-water-no-longer">Awesome filter! Nasty campground water no longer&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have run these for years in my RV and they work killer! Here&rsquo;s some more in-depth thoughts:Pros:- These work better than I had expected. Just hook them up to the water source, hook your hose to it, run it to your trailer and viola` clean and good tasting water. Some of the places we have visited have had water that I wouldn&rsquo;t feed to my worst enemy. With this thing attached, it&rsquo;s very good tasting.- I like the hose attachment that comes with this to aide in adding flexibility to the system and not put too much strain on the system. I have bought so many of these, I now use one attaching the filter to the nozzle, one out of the filter to my hose, and one attaching my hose to the trailer.Notes:- I will note that the manufacturer suggesting using these for only 1 camping season, and this makes sense. That&rsquo;s what I do, and it seems to work out great. It&rsquo;s not too much $ to replace every season.- Another note, when first putting this filter into service (just the first time of the season, subsequent hook-ups wont do this) there will be a bunch of carbon (black in the water) that comes out of the faucet in your trailer. This is perfectly fine, safe, and of no issue. This is the filter breaking in and getting the extra carbon out of the system. There is no health concern with this happening. I just run the faucet until it clears up, and then we&rsquo;re good to go for the rest of the season.- Last note, when we unhook from our camping spot, I swing the filter in my hand with my arm extended (using centrifugal force, not centrifical, look it up) to get the residual water out of the filter so it doesn&rsquo;t sit in there and spoil. I do this until I get most of the water drops to stop, leave it out on the counter to dry, and boom, it&rsquo;s perfect the next time.Cons:- None to reportOverall this filter does a great job taking care of some seriously nasty campground water that we&rsquo;ve encountered all over the Southwest US. I cannot recommend it any higher.I hope I have helped your purchasing decision of this product.

<blockquote>
<p>I just installed this on a spigot in my horse barn and I&rsquo;m impressed already! The house water is taken care of with a water system, but the barn water always had iron in it. The iron got worse since the pressure tank was replaced in the house to the point where water was cloudy brown with sediment floating in i! Had a water company come out and test the water, said the barn water is fine for the horses but if we wanted to get all the iron out of it we&rsquo;d have to replace/upgrade the system in the house to the tune of $2600. Also said this sometimes happens when a pressure tank is replace, it may or many not settle in a few months. So I went and put one of these little filters on the spigot, figure for $15 it was worth the shot. Granted it probably isn&rsquo;t taking all the iron out, but at least the water is clear now and no chunks of sediment floating around! I made my husband taste the water after I put the filter on (LOL), he said it still has a metallic taste to it&hellip;. but oh well, makes me feel better that my horses are at least drinking clear water with not so much iron in it now. Attached is before and after photo of the water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My dad swears by this thing, and we purchased it after his recommendation. We haven&rsquo;t noticed anything different in the water in our RV, but am sure that it is filtering some of the nasties out.Unfortunately we had to return and order a second one because after being on for 3 days, the first one sprung a leak through one of the seams on the filter. New one seems to be working ok for now (has been one for a couple of weeks), but I am weary of quality and how long it will last after the first one gave so soon.</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t applied this yet, but just for appearances and swift delivery. I&rsquo;m giving it 5 stars.Will update IF NEED BE..OTHERWISE THE 5 STAR RATING STAYSUpdate: After finishing installing the 25 gallon water tank in my van/home/conversion I used this filter and it works perfectly as described.Just make sure that you run water thru this for a few seconds or so BEFORE filling your tank because a lot of loose charcoal will flow out that you won&rsquo;t want in your tank.After that it flows freely and is easy to use and fills tank pretty quickly with clean fresh water.</p>

<h5 id="decently-awesome">Decently awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty all right. If you&rsquo;re pumping from a spring, make sure the water isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;chunky&rdquo; + doesn&rsquo;t have bits of algae + whatnot floating around because it will clog this. My one complaint is that I set up a tub for the spring to pour into + the water came out SO clear + I pumped it with my gas powered pump + used this filter but the water still tasted kinda nasty + had tiny little things floating around in it (I have insanely good vision <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> + my friend (who has glasses) couldn&rsquo;t see what I was talking about but STILL nasty!)I didn&rsquo;t get sick but it&rsquo;s not something I would use alone in questionable water. Next time, I&rsquo;ll probably use 2 of these instead of just the one</p>
