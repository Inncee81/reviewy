<h5 id="good-bargain-on-a-good-telescope">Good bargain on a good telescope.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have their SpaceProbe 3 telescope already, so I may have been expecting a bit much out of this as it is 2x the aperture. It was easy to setup, if not a bit heavy to lug around. We got stunning views of the moon, and were able to see more detail with saturn (more moons than before) .I was hoping for a little more detail on Jupiter but was left a little short there. Where I want to try it most is in my hunt for the Messier catalog, but haven&rsquo;t had enough clear good seeing nights to try that out. We will be trying it as soon as we can.Long story short, I&rsquo;ve been impressed with Orion and their products, this is the second telescope I&rsquo;ve purchased from them and it is well built, was columnated from the factory (yes I checked) and is simple to setup and use.</p>

<h5 id="looking-at-guides-for-newbies-and-reading-reviews-online-for-the-best-starter-telescope-in-my-price-range">looking at guides for newbies and reading reviews online for the best starter telescope in my price range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are <em>brand new</em> to the stargazing world and this is our very first telescope. I researched for months before buying: looking at guides for newbies and reading reviews online for the best starter telescope in my price range. I searched on backyard astronomer websites, other telescope site reviews, etc. I decided on this 6&rdquo; Dobsonian and when it arrived in two very large and heavy boxes I was intimidated.I thought this would be too difficult to assemble and I was overwhelmed. I searched on YouTube and was thankfully able to find 2 video tutorials that went thru the set up of this telescope and highly recommend you do as well. The YouTube videos (from Orion) were easier to follow than the printed directions included. I was able to get it set up within about 1 hour - so I am confident that any beginner can assemble it too. The boxes were packed well and securely - nothing was damaged in shipping.Overall I&rsquo;m glad I purchased this one, but if we ever have to downsize or move to a smaller place I have no idea where we will store it: it&rsquo;s pretty big. Also, it&rsquo;s not really practical to pack up and take places. I am attaching photos from the last time we went on an evening picnic and brought the telescope - so it&rsquo;s definitely possible - but it&rsquo;s an undertaking. I recently went on a roadtrip and we wanted to be able to use the telescope because of the visibility, but we didn&rsquo;t have enough space and didn&rsquo;t want to carry this thing around: so if you&rsquo;re a beginner and want to bring your telescope with you I&rsquo;d recommend a different model. While I really do like this one, I am bummed that it&rsquo;s not more portable.One pleasant surprise: although all the reviews and guides said this model isn&rsquo;t ideal for photos I have still been able to get some pretty cool shots with my iPhone (also attaching these to my review) - it&rsquo;s not easy or ideal but you can get some neat pictures!</p>

<h5 id="huge-bang-for-buck">HUGE bang for buck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is unbelievable to me that a scope this good can be had for this price. Six inches is a LOT of aperture. Forget those little blue rigs with the computerized pointing&ndash;you don&rsquo;t need a computer to find stuff, you need <em>aperture</em> so you can actually see it. Download some free planetarium software (like Stellarium), buy a sky atlas, and get a nice fat telescope like this one. You&rsquo;ll enjoy it more because the views will actually be good enough to linger over, and you can take pride in finding observing targets on your own. If you want a computer to do all the work, why even buy a telescope? Stay on the couch and surf for some Hubble images.The scope is rock solid, it was in nearly perfect collimation right out of the box, and I put it together in about an hour while I watched TV. Then it was out the back door and BAM! The moon looks so good you may get stuck there for a while. Cloud belts on Jupiter are a breeze, as are the rings of Saturn. Star clusters look like diamonds scattered on black velvet. Galaxies and nebulas seduce your eyeballs until you realize that it&rsquo;s well past midnight and you&rsquo;re frozen half to death.One warning: the best scope for you is the one you will use the most. At 35 lbs assembled this is about as much scope as I want to be moving by myself. So think about the weight. If you decide it would keep you from using this scope very often, get a smaller one. Orion&rsquo;s XT4.5 is this thing&rsquo;s little brother, it weighs half as much, and it has gotten uniformly good reviews just about everywhere.One last thing: Dobsonians are not useful for most kinds of astrophotography but I have taken some stunning pictures of the moon just by holding my digital camera up to the eyepiece of this telescope. Give it a try&ndash;you may end up decorating your entryway with moon photos you took yourself.</p>
