<h5 id="a-must-have-rv-upgrade">A Must have RV upgrade.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a must have for RV camping if you need to stay connected. It&rsquo;s easy to install and works right out of the box. I was getting -110db and after i turned on the unit is was getting -80db. I would recommend buying a seprate antenna set for your vehicle because it works great for everyday use as well. I haven&rsquo;t had a dropped call even living in the Colorado mountains. FYI if the 20&rsquo; outside wire is not long enough I talked to weboost and you can run up to 50&rsquo; on the external antenna.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pleased-with-our-purchase">Pleased with our purchase&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hubby and I are remote workers and travel frequently in our RV. We purchased this about a month ago and have tested in several scenarios to be able to work. As noted it is not a wifi booster, rather cell booster. We also purchased TechnoRV suction cup mounts and PVC for a mast so we can position anywhere on the RV for the best signal rather than a permanent mount. We went from 0 or weak cell signal to 3-4, sometimes 5 bars in areas we have had no signal before. The cellular boost would then boost our ATT wifi puck and allow us to connect laptops and iPhones/iPads with no problem. We have ATT and works great for us</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="weboost-drive-4g-x-rv-4g-cell-signal-booster">weBoost Drive 4G-X-RV 4G Cell Signal Booster.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this 4G cell signal booster from Wilson Electronics for my Airstream TT and it has performed admirably. This product can&rsquo;t boost a cell signal that doesn&rsquo;t exist, it however, can and does significantly boost a marginal 4G cell signal. Nothing on the market comes close to the product quality and expert customer service. Packaging and install instructions are clear and well thought out. weBoost Drive 4G-X RV Cell Phone Signal Booster for RVs and Mobile Homes - Enhance Your Signal up to 32x. For Multiple Devices and Users</p>

<h5 id="we-boost">We boost</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have using this for several rv trips now, and I&rsquo;m still not sure if this was wise $decision and not sure it works that good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-does-improve-reception">It does improve reception.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing works great. I went from 1 bar to 3 and 4 bars and her phone went from ZERO to 3 bars (so that made her happy). It was easy to install and register. I took the time to make it look factory installed not rushing and got it done in 3 hours. It could easily be done in less time but with my OCD it took me that long&hellip;..but it does look factory installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok">OK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t gotten the gain I was looking for and this was expensive!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-work-with-sprint">Does not work with Sprint</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not work with Sprint. The description needs to be updated.After contacting manufacturer they were willing to buy it back. Good costumer service. Too bad it didn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>

<p>5 stars</p>

<h5 id="it-is-working-fine-i-have-only-used-it-in-a-poor">it is working fine. I have only used it in a poor &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, it is working fine. I have only used it in a poor reception area for a couple days and now I am using it in a good reception area.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="design-seems-great-but-wouldn-t-work">Design seems great. But wouldn&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Design seems great.But wouldn&rsquo;t work. Call to company &amp; was told it&rsquo;s a SPRINT issue. This won&rsquo;t work with Sprint 4G.Would have been nice to see that on the listing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cell phone booster works great. I pair it up with my Verizon Mi-Fi for full RV service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-good-but-didn-t-work">Looks good, but didn&rsquo;t work.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product appears to be well built and has everything you would need to boost your cell signal except for a mounting pole.</p>

<h5 id="din-t-work-for-me">Din&rsquo;t work for me.</h5>
