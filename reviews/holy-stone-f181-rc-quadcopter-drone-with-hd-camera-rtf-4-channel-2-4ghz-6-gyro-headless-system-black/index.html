<p>Important Tips for Drone:
1.The motors and circuit board will heat up with miseuse.We suggest the users take a 10 minute cool down break between flights to ensure the parts last as long as possible.
2.To avoid being burnt up the USB Charger, it should be used under currents input 0.5A.
3.Don&rsquo;t push the throttle up hard directly. Adjust the throttle slowly to avoid damage caused by loss of control.
4.The weight of quad copter is less than 0.5lb and no registration is required for this model on FAA.</p>

<p>Cautions for Lipo Battery Usage:
1)Don&rsquo;t use or charge a battery if it shows signs of swelling, pierced, or damaged in any way.
2)Don&rsquo;t charge the battery directly after use, allow it time to cool down in an open and dry area to insure overheating does not occur.
3)Please be away from furniture carpet or anything flammable. A fireproof bag is recommended for lipo battery charge or storage.
4)Don&rsquo;t charge the battery above 0.5A. Make sure to remove the battery from the charger after charging is complete, never overcharge the battery.
5)Be cautious while removing a battery from the charger, it’s possible to strip the cords that could lead to a fire( and ruin the battery)</p>

<p>revised review: after 1st time out getting some video, copter worked fine, downloaded videos and every one was apparently corrupted. videos were not playable. yes there were some hard landings but they were all in tall grass. shouldnt have damaged camera if thats why they arent playable.Revised Review #2. quadcopter makers sent a complete replacement copter. it works fine and video is also working on this unit. excellent customer service, quick and painless! not often that you can find a company that stands behind their product aswell as Holy Stone. A++</p>

<p>After reading countless reviews in search of a quad with a camera, I settled on the Holy Stone F181 and so far, have been quite pleased with it. The initial problem I had with researching was the numerous quads with 5 star reviews were from customers who were given free items in exchange for their reviews. I felt like this skewed the actual results. Who would give a negative review for a company that was giving them free stuff? This was not the case with the Holy Stone F181. Many reviewers have pointed out their exceptional customer service however I didn&rsquo;t think I would need tech support as I am an experienced flyer. I did have one issue in which I reached out to customer service and they went well above and beyond to make sure I was completely satisfied. It&rsquo;s true what they say. Holy Stone stands by their products 100%.Pros:Outstanding customer service.This thing flies extremely smooth.Has 4 modes, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. 25% being more for beginners and 100% being for more advanced flyers.Headless mode works quite well.The flip feature is AWESOME!Takes decent, not outstanding pictures/videos which was expected for this price range.Comes with everything you need right out of the box.I was able to fly this higher than any other quad I own that was in the same price range.Durable. I&rsquo;ve crashed it a couple times without single scratch and have even flown it indoors with relative ease.Has a &ldquo;headlight&rdquo; for visibility during night flying even with the LEDs off.Cons:Battery life is somewhat short, as with most quads when recording video and LEDs on.No higher capacity battery upgrades that I&rsquo;m aware of.The controller continuously beeps when in headless mode.All in all, for the price this one is hard to beat for beginners and even more advanced flyers and Holy Stone customer service is outstanding!</p>

<p>This is (was) my first drone. I didn&rsquo;t want to drop $1000 on a DJI until I knew how to fly. This little guy is a great drone. I will keep this short: I didn&rsquo;t test the camera or even use it. I just wanted to get a drone I could fly indoors and practice. The first thing I can say is READ THE MANUAL. There are things on the controller that are not obvious as far as operation (like trimming the forward/back/left/right). That said, this does fly well for a $100 drone. However one of the motors burned out after my 2nd day of use. So that was rude. Also I would HIGHLY suggest you use the prop guards&hellip;my houseplants would also very much agree. Here&rsquo;s a list of pros and cons:PROS:1 - Flies well and is very durable (I crashed it about 20 times)2 - Great lights for night flying3 - Looks cool4 - Comes with 2 batteries (about 5 min. of flight each one)CONS:1 - Motor burned out on day 22 - You have to screw in the prop guards which isnt obvious in the instruction manual3 - Batteries are kind of a pain to swap out4 - The light on the USB battery charger dont turn green when the battery is chargedSo overall I think this is a $49 drone, not a $100 drone. I am not a fan of having to contact support and wait for motors along with shipping and all that hassle. For $100 I thought the motors would at least last a few months&hellip;it&rsquo;s not like I was flying in wind or even outside. But it is a cool little drone, just not super well made.UPDATE: They sent out a replacement drone to me right away after reading my review on Amazon. That is unheard of these days!</p>

<h5 id="while-some-of-the-other-drones-are-better-than-this-one">While some of the other drones are better than this one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quad-copters have been a little bit of a fad in my group of friends lately. We have guys with parrots, djis, symas, hubsans, and udis. While some of the other drones are better than this one, none of them can beat it in bang for your buck. To have a quad-copter for this price that can go up to 300m and stay in the air for over 10 mins is awesome.Now for the negative, this will be short because its hard to find a lot wrong with this drone. I&rsquo;ve had a little problem with the camera. Sometimes it says it&rsquo;s recording but when I try and upload the video it wasnt saved. The yaw is a little slow too, and it dosnt get any faster through the different settings. The last thing, although I doubt Holy Stone makes their own batteries, is one of the batteries takes almost 3 hours to charge and seems to drain quickly.Hope this review is helpful, this is an awesome xcopter for begineers and intermediate flyers. You also cant beat what you get for the price.</p>
