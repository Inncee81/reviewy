<blockquote>
<p>This projector does a fantastic job. I can now watch movies/tv with the lights on. I have 6 recessed lights which are quite bright and the image is still viewable. The 3D works quite well to. It can show 3d SBS and straight 3D movies and there are couple of other options as well. My only quam is that the projector does have to set a good 20 feet from the image to throw a 16 foot diagonal image. As far as glasses for the projector i recommend SainSonic SSZ-200DLB. They are comfortable and look great. I have tried others and they do a far worst job in creating 3D image.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really awesome projector, High resolution and great picture! This is my first projector and I&rsquo;m glad I chose this one, its BRIGHT! And I have a really nice set up for it, see the pictures for yourself, the shutter on my camera really bleeds the the colors out so it does it no justice. But believe me, its a great projector for the price, really good for watching movies and tv shows, I have a multi HDMI source dock for it so I have my PS4, DirecTV receiver, samsung 5.1 surround bluray player and roku3 playing through with no issues. I have it semi permanently attached to my ceiling so I have yet to use it out doors to test the 300&rdquo; limit on this thing, But so far I&rsquo;m impressed with it.My only concern is that one day I will have to replace the bulb, I&rsquo;ve seen prices range anywhere from 199 to 400+. I live in a high altitude area at just under 6000 feet, it was nice to see it had a feature for preserving the bulb by increasing its fan output to keep it the bulb cooler.</p>

<h5 id="bad-longevity-great-picture-very-bright-and-quiet">BAD LONGEVITY!!! great picture, very bright&hellip;.and quiet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>09/2014: Replaced an older model (TX-542 HD- this has the same mounting specs and throw range), and was immediately impressed by this projector&rsquo;s brilliance and picture quality. This is almost identical to a much higher-priced Optoma business model. It&rsquo;s very quiet, even when certain settings (high altitude, bright lamp setting) kicking the fan up to a higher speed, it&rsquo;s still not overly loud. As with any device, use a Video Calibration DVD to get the best picture. (After calibration my brightness, contrast, and sharpness settings were much lower than default, and the picture quality was much improved.)&mdash;&ndash; UPDATE, 03/2016I have had 3 Optoma projectors in the past 5 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years. I have been hopeful that I&rsquo;ve had bad luck with them, but now I&rsquo;m giving up and giving advice to others: beware- these projectors do not last!!!The first 2 were TX-542 models, one regular, and one 3D. Each started showing stuck pixels after one year, once the warranty ran out. The first one I thought was maybe jarred during our move to a new house, or dust from pets. So I got the same model to replace it. That one had the same thing happen, same time frame. Reviews online revealed others had the same issue.I replaced the second one with a DH-1011, having read good reviews about this model. I was very happy with the picture quality and especially the brightness. With less than 25% of the bulb hours used, though, it stopped working. It would flash the bulb indicator after 5 minutes of trying to start, even with a brand new bulb in it. Optoma Support, though knowledgeable and friendly, have very few options to offer, and that&rsquo;s the real problem.Optoma OEM bulb replacements are around half the cost of a new projector. The first thing tech support needs you to do in order to troubleshoot is purchase one of these, and if that doesn&rsquo;t work you need to shell out over $100 more send it in for diagnostics. So for the cost of troubleshooting, to see if it is a problem that can even be fixed, maybe for a few hundred more, you can buy a new projector. Sadly, this is in part why I bought projectors #2 and 3, but no more. I am going with a different brand and suggest everyone wanting to get more than 18 months out of your purchase do the same.If you don&rsquo;t mind buying a disposable, un-serviceable product for your money, and are willing to spend the same amount again in 2 years or less on a new model, than these are good projectors for you. I really wish these would last longer than 18 months, but after 3 times it&rsquo;s obvious they either have recurring, widespread issues, or this is their business model- which could explain the lack of support and servicing options.Such a shame.=====update 4/2016One day after posting this review on the Optoma website, I received a one-time warranty fix for my most recent failed projector model (which failed just a few months beyond the short 1-year warranty period). This was a nice gesture to keep me immediately satisfied, and the projector worked like new once again. The return packaging was not up to the quality level that they require when you send the unit in, however, and there was very little information on what the issue was, which further indicates to me that support behind these projectors is not to the level that is needed. I will greatly enjoy this awesome picture for as long as this projector lasts, but I highly doubt I will ever again buy from Optoma, given the bad track record I&rsquo;ve had with 3 different units.</p>

<h5 id="great-projector-awesome-value">Great projector, Awesome value!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to the home theater thing but so far I&rsquo;m loving it! I had rented this projector in the past for a Hollywood themed birthday party &amp; was so impressed I decided to buy it for my family as a household Christmas gift. The picture quality is great! I was concerned about the lamp life when compared to others but we don&rsquo;t use it on a daily basis so 8000hrs (on Eco mode) should suffice. I would give it 5 stars but the speaker leaves a lot to be desired. I&rsquo;m not to concerned with it because we will be adding a theater surround system soon. Also another terrific feature, the picture quality remains the same if your watching in the dark or with lights on. I believe that&rsquo;s related to the lumen count. Overall, I love product &amp; I really loved the price. I would recommend to others.</p>

<h5 id="love-love-love-super-bright">Love Love Love - Super Bright</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a splurge of a purchase after we moved into a new home. I wanted something my kids would enjoy in their late teens. I wanted a projector that could play movies outside and still be bright enough to see. I didn&rsquo;t have a fortune to spend, but I didn&rsquo;t want to go cheap either. We can start movies about 30mins before sunset and have no trouble seeing the videos shown. YIPPEE!!! When it does get dark, you honestly feel like you are in a theater, except enjoying the backyard with friends. In the winter months we pull it inside and project on the screen. The kids play video games using it with huge crowds of kids.Haven&rsquo;t tried the 3D capabilities as of yet&hellip;.but super excited to see the results.</p>

<h5 id="great-bright-crystal-clear-image">Great, bright, crystal clear image</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my sister so she could show outdoor movies. Still gets used for this, but has mostly been appropriated by my nephew for video games and indoor movies. Its been a few years now and it still works awesome.Pros: Super bright, crystal clear image, even at dusk outdoors, with a decent throw ratio.Cons: The sound is a bit whimpy for outdoors. There you&rsquo;re better off plugging it into a boom box or something similar. Height adjustment could use a bit more range.I cannot speak to the 3D capabilities, but my nephews say this works great as well.</p>
