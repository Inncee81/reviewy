<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Color:Black
Many of us want to protect our business&amp; home and are looking for a cost effective solution to monitor them while we are not there. It can notify us when someone enters the area they shouldn’t, capture images of events that take place while we are away, give us a view of what is going on , and keep an eye on pets, children,and the elderly.</p>

<p>We are familiar with traditional CCTV surveillance attached to a VCR or DVR,but many of the modern DVR do not allow you to do what we mentioned above. What’s worse ,it requires expensive wiring and takes too much electricity without HD quality images on our televisions,computers and cell phones.</p>

<p>Now,the &ldquo;CCTV&rdquo; (Closed Circuit Television) camera, while still in use, is gradually being replaced by another more efficient digital product—wireless IP camera.Wireless IP cameras provide an easy-to-install and easy-to-control solution for video surveillance. </p>

<p>Now,I would like to recommend KeeKoon&rsquo;s IP camera for everyone!</p>

<p>Benefits of KeeKoon IP camera include:</p>

<p>Remote administration from any location.</p>

<p>2.0 Megapixel/1080P HD Wired/Wireless IP Camera</p>

<p>IR Cut-off Filter for true color (no color cast)</p>

<p>Night Vision (up to 8 meters) via auto IR-LED illumination</p>

<p>Two-way communication.</p>

<p>90°wide-angle advanced glass lens combined with 340° horizontal &amp; 90° vertical rotation range creates a complete 360° coverage.</p>

<p>The ability to send alerts if any suspicious activity is detected.</p>

<p>Support PC (Windows, Mac), Tablet (iPad, Android), Smartphone (iOS, Android) to monitor and control from anywhere at anytime.</p>

<h5 id="extremely-impressive-camera-well-worth-the-price">Extremely impressive camera, well worth the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really clever tech. Great quality camera and superior night vision. Love the two way conversation function. Great for anyone with pets or babies to monitor. Could do with being able to pan down more but the 360 spin and completely vertical upwards pan gives you great scope for monitoring. Like that it comes with wall mount. Easy to install and sync with WiFi. Reliable piece of equipment. Only flaw is that the cable provided is extremely short and does not give you much reign on positioning of the camera. May be best to purchase a longer cable especially for wall mounting. Love the app and camera is very easy to control on phone. Did have a problem with the cable stopping working after 2 months but company was extremely good and sent a new cable out immediately for me. Very good communicating. Very professional company and product and extremely great discount price. 100% worth the price!</p>

<h5 id="quality-item-and-stupid-proof-to-install">quality item and stupid proof to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>delivery fast, As for IP Camera it is of good quality and it has good image and control the sound and mic work good. After downloading the app, I use Qr barcode scanner and scanned in all the correct barcodes including the one on the base of the IP Camera it was 1% away from stupid proof just follow the on screen instructions do the password and change it. Setting inside the App are just a simple to follow. I cant understand the bad reviews from other buyer!!!!</p>
