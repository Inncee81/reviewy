</ul>

<p>TriggerPoint GRID foam rollers feature a patented design that offers a superior, multi-density exterior constructed over a rigid, hollow core that withstands repeated use while maintaining shape and integrity. The proven durability of the GRID has helped make it a trusted tool of physical therapists, massage therapists, athletic trainers and professional athletes. The GRID can be used to roll through tight muscles, knots and kinks to reduce soreness and improve mobility. Regular use of the GRID can provide benefits such as recovery from (or preventing) injuries, decreased muscle and joint pain, increased circulation and flexibility, improved balance and mobility and preparing the body for peak performance. The distinctive, multi-dimensional surfaces of the GRID replicate the feeling of a massage therapist’s hands - wide and flat like the palm, long and tubular like the fingers, and small and firm like the finger tips. The textured surface of the GRID helps to maximize the flow of blood and oxygen to heal tissue. TriggerPoint GRID foam rollers are available in three sizes and two densities. Regular density models include the original 13-inch GRID, the 26-inch GRID 2.0, and the 4-inch travel-friendly GRID Mini. The 13-inch GRID X features extra dense foam for working the tightest muscles. Purchase of any TriggerPoint GRID foam roller includes free access to an online instructional video library from the experts at TriggerPoint that illustrate the best foam roller techniques. 1-year warranty.</p>

<h5 id="great-foam-roller-but-beware-of-fakes">Great foam roller but beware of fakes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great foam roller that will fix your muscle pain in minutes.Make sure you get the real thing though. I received a fake on my initial purchase.Here are some tips to spot knock-offs:- fakes have no printed logo on top- no patent label on the inside- no packaging (which contains the exercises and instructions)- strong chemical smell upon unboxing- the fake was also way harder than the real one.Glad I could finally get the real one and start doing some rolling.The TP GRID is definitely on the hard side of foam rollers but the foam is very comfortable while rolling.The exercises on the packaging are helpful to get you started the right way.I have been enjoying it regularly since.Beware of fakes and happy rolling with the TP GRID!</p>

<h5 id="great-for-sore-muscles">Great for Sore Muscles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect roller to help with sore muscles. I sometimes have a sore back from sitting in my home office for hours at a time, and being able to roll out my back or sore muscles with this product is excellent! For my aching joints, I use Ostaflex –Relief from Severe Joint Ache with Glucosamine, MSM, &amp; Chondroitin and it is amazing, my knee pain is almost completely gone. The high density foam is high quality, does not have an odor like other products, and is quite firm, but comfortable and feels great on the muscle. Try these two products, you will not be sorry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-brand-to-buy-for-at-home-use">Best brand to buy for at home use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I started using one of these at my gym, and man oh man, is that a great feeling. I have mild back pain from work, so I decided to buy one of these to keep at my house and I read online that Trigger Point was the best brand to buy for at home use.I read through all the reviews, and decided to go for this particular model and it was delivered pretty quickly. All I can say is, wow. This one is actually better than the one I use at my gym. It eased the pain in my lower back, and actually works really well loosening up my muscles. I&rsquo;ve started using it after working out and it seriously reduces the amount of soreness I have in my muscles the following day. I absolutely swear by it. I give it five stars, AND, I have a tip for all the fitness enthusiasts who use foam rollers for their muscles.ThermaChill Pain Relief Roll On Cold Therapy, 3 fl oz. - Top Choice for Arthritis, Migraine Relief, Joint &amp; Muscle Pain - Limited Time Offer: Buy 1 Get 1 Free!.I started using this topical pain reliever after a friend at the gym recommended it for me, and it makes such a huge difference. Basically I get home, take a really hot shower, and use the foam roller on my lower back and any areas that I worked out recently. I then take the Thermachill and rub it on all of the areas that I just used the foam roller on, and this amazing warming sensation takes over and then cools down, completely alleviating any pain. The thermachill has tea tree oil and menthol, but it doesn&rsquo;t have too strong of a smell and it&rsquo;s completely easy to roll on without getting all over everything. I recommend it as an added product to use after the foam roller, as it gives you immediate relief for any ailments you may have.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-to-help-stretch-tense-neck-muscles">Perfect to help stretch tense neck muscles.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a lightning deal, not knowing what exactly to expect, but thinking my husband who is chronically tight in his shoulders and neck could somehow use this. A Christmas gift for a man who has everything, I was surprised by his daily, if not twice daily use of this roller. It took him about a week to figure out how best to use it for maximum benefit and now has no idea how he ever lived without it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-product">Awesome Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me just say that I&rsquo;ve been having back pain or many years and Im glad I purchased this because this is a life saver. My back hasn&rsquo;t felt this good in years, no lie. This isn&rsquo;t a paid advertisement either. My title tell all &ldquo;picky purchaser&rdquo; because I am and I tell the truth about what I buy ad use. Im really writing this for the people that have back pain.Instead of going to a doctor and getting surgery and rehab, try this first! like I said Ive been in pain for years until now, I still feel little pain but no where near what it use to be. Let me just say that for many years of incorrect posture and many other things in your life, your back will back out of line and this will put it back in. (1) correct your sitting posture (2) do some back stretches, look on youtube for them. Then ad this back roller to it. At first this will hurt because your back isn&rsquo;t use to going in the right direction. there are a few ways to do this to, pick the one you like and go with it. I do this everyday for as little as 5 minute and this makes all the difference.If you have back pain go out and get this or any other back roller, doesn&rsquo;t have to be this one and do this for 5 minutes a day. Every day you back will feel less pain. Also, a hot water bottle on the back to relax the muscles wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, good luck and hope this helps.</p>

<h5 id="wow-great-product">Wow, great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw a ballerina using this and became very intrigued. So I bought one.This is an amazing tool for athletes.Well built and an amazing concept.My only negative feedback is that the company website is geared towards getting you to pay them for a subscription and not giving you explanations on the various ways to use this product and that part was frustrating. The online videos sucked and I am not paying. Will check elsewhere for explanations, the companies focus is misguided as they should focus on getting newbies excited about this product.I have used mine every day. It is incredibly relaxing and helps you find the muscles you are more tense in and work on them.This with a lacrosse ball for feet relaxing is golden.</p>
