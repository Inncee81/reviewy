<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product after carefully reading lots of reviews about this and other similar products and this one peeked my interest the most from the reviews. After making the purchase, the product arrived on time and in great condition. I want to say that I&rsquo;m a QC manager and have been for many years so it&rsquo;s in my nature to look at, test, move, tweak, twist and try every piece of everything I buy for proper operation and that it works as described/designed.First off, I read a few reviews that a parts list with a very brief description would be nice to accompany this product. I say the same thing. You&rsquo;re getting 50 pieces and if you pull them out and count them, you probably aren&rsquo;t going to know if you got all the right pieces or just a handful of the same thing tossed in to complete the package. I found two straps that I don&rsquo;t know what they would be used for. I guess trial and error will have to work.The carrying case is made of good quality material with a foam insert, a webbed pouch on the inside, top and the zipper is sewn good. The items that have elastic work very well. The head piece has two adjusting buckles and a thin, non-slip surface on the inside that doesn&rsquo;t hurt or catch your hair if not using a hat. The chest camera holder also has nice elastic with five adjustments on it. It&rsquo;s easy to put on and make adjustments to the shoulder and midsection straps. The chest strap will move some, but that&rsquo;s expected with the types of clothes you wear and your physical appearance. I&rsquo;m not an athlete, but it works great and is very comfortable. The wrist camera holder is soft to the touch. Has a piece of velco on the inner strap to help get the wrist strap on and then there is a second strap that allows for the strap to tighten. The camera attachment swivels for any angle and has a button that will lock the camera in place. Nice feature. It came with a selfie stick that is about 36&rdquo;+ long with a screw that would screw into the bottom of a regular camera. The package comes with the adaptor that attaches to your GoPro and the stick. There is a three leg tripod that works well and can be manipulated to wrap around items that aren&rsquo;t flat, etc. It too has the attachment that would screw into a camera. There is also a threaded hole in the handle end of the selfie stick that it can screw onto the tripod to get height on the camera. There is an attachment that can be attached to handlebars or small diameter tubing. There are multiple adhesive pieces to attach brackets to hard surfaces.I suggest you check every bolt, nut and attachment to make sure they all work. All the bolts that came with the product are well made and have the same amount of threads per bolt protruding from the black plastic handle. I noticed that the nuts that are molded into the different attachments are not all the same depth. This is going to cause the issue that I&rsquo;m not happy with and will try to describe what I found because of this.The pieces that have the nuts molded in them and work with the camera and other attachment to get the camera in the angle and position to get the action movies and pictures you&rsquo;re looking for are not all the same depth in the moldings. Is what happens is when the bolt is placed through the molded piece to screw into the nut, it goes through too far and only allows for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> - 1 thread to secure the piece. There are two pieces that won&rsquo;t allow for the bolt to catch the threads at all. This is very unacceptable.After working with every bolt and screwing it into every nut, I want to make a finding that will help you, if you purchase this and the company, if they decide to add a parts list and a few operating statements. I found six pieces that I couldn&rsquo;t get the bolts to screw into. I tried different bolts and it felt as though the threads were crossed threaded. I finally tried turning the bolts to the left first (like you loosen bolts) until I felt a click. Then, I turned the bolt to tighten it and those six pieces could be tightened like the rest. I was thinking seriously about returning this product until I figured that out. Yes, it takes about 2 seconds longer to get the attachment tightened, but it works and I don&rsquo;t think it warrants returning the item.The items that I do have an issue with and hope the manufacture responds to are the 5 items that will not allow for a secure attachment because the nuts aren&rsquo;t in the molding far enough to catch the threads of the bolts.So, I think this is a good product. If the manufacturer can get the inconsistencies of the molded nuts fixed so there is a 100% operational satisfaction, I would definitely give this a 5 stars. Would I recommend this product for purchase, yes, because all the major components work as designed, it was only a few of the smaller pieces that had issues. There are enough extra pieces in this package that something can be used to get those fabulous pictures and movies you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p>I used the housing for the wristband and when I went into the beach to boogie board I noticed that it was pretty sturdy up until 10 minutes later I noticed my GoPro wasn&rsquo;t even attached anymore. So if you find a GoPro hero 5 in Manhattan beach somewhere please send it to me. Thanks!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-products">Excellent products</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this for i think a year. I love this thing. The case will hold several cameras and had everything you would need inside to get good videos. I would recommend to anyone just getting into videos and GoPro camerasIf anyone is worried about the quality. I have used this for at least a year and have not broken one part yet.</p>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The accessories they sent along with the bag are decent, but the bag itself is a real letdown. The cutouts are not really appropriately sized and the GoPro gear you put in them doesn&rsquo;t stay put.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-pretty-good-pack">it&rsquo;s a pretty good pack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the fittings had defects and couldn&rsquo;t be used. For the price though, it&rsquo;s a pretty good pack.The inside padding for the case was completely unusable. It was bent and flimsy and just in the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tons-of-pieces">Tons of Pieces&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of stuff in this kit I&rsquo;ll never use, but there is easily more than $20 worth of stuff I will. So far, the pieces I have used are useful, easy to use and do their job just fine.</p>
