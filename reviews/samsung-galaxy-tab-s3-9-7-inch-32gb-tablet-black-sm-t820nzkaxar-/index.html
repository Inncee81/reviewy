<blockquote>
<p>I waited quite a while before doing a review on my new Samsung tab S3 tablet. I wanted to give it at least a week of use in my office and in daily activities. I have had many tablets, including and using Microsoft tablets, the Samsung tab S2 8 and Samsung tab A 10.1 inch tablets.I am a person who prefaces this review by noting that I am not a gamer. I use if for work, for e-mail correspondence, updating myself on new and current features, and also using Android apps. I need to be able to perform light editing on papers, interact with an online office system that allows access to a data base, and get access to multiple web sites without a problem. Also, I use my tablet to watch movies when I travel.I tend to be a little OCD in my desire to read other reviews. I also am an editor of several publications, so I look at these reviews with an editor’s eye. I always try to figure out if their biased, or if they represent a view point that may not reflect my needs. That does not dismiss the other reviews, it merely points out that some people have different expectations and demands.And, I dismiss outright any review from someone who has neither purchased nor used the item. You cannot evaluate a product on the basis of the specifications.So, here is my opinion and finding;1.) The screen is much brighter than the Tab S2. I have used it outside with a Phantom 4 drone. The S2 is almost useless in the sun. This one is absolutely more visible. The brightness based on critical reviews finds it one of the brightest screens, brighter than the Apple and second only to the Google Pixel C.2.) The GPS is very sensitive. One of the reasons I didn’t choose the Google Pixel C is the google tablet has no GPS.3.) I have not found any lag with any application. I have read the reviews about problems with certain games. I agree, they may not run as well on this processor as with the Apple. However, for me this is a non issue.4.) Flawless video streaming from all services including Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.5.) I can connect to a office networking system using a Citrix receiver and not have delay or lag issues. With my Tab S2 the processor was inadequate to load the system. I have never had any Android system that would load the Citrix receiver and load the connection to the main system.6.) Excellent and extremely stable and fast WIFI.7.) The SD card does not load or hold all programs. The tablet is only 32gb of ram. However, having downloaded all of my prior Android apps, my photos (which do go to the SD card), and with daily use, I have over 19GB of storage.8.) All downloaded files can be stored on the SD card9.) I actually like the 8 inch Tab S2 as it fits in my jacket pocket. However, the added size of this tablet offsets the inconvenience. And, as phones get bigger, there isn’t much difference between my 6 inch phone display and my 8 inch tablet.10.) I got the silver. It matches the cover and only the back is silver, the entire front is black. For those who have noted over and over about the black back being a fingerprint magnet, get the silver. There are no fingerprints to be seen on this color.I also got the Keyboard, purchased separately at Best Buy as it was out of stock on Amazon.I honestly think that there is an expectation by some to have tablet keyboard to be the best most wonderful keyboard in the world. It is functional and does a good job. It is for a tablet that is 9.7 inches and cannot be a full sized keyboard. Having had many tablet keyboards, including ones from Samsung, here is my opinion and update to correct or add previous information.1.) When detaching the tablet, it turns off the tablet. Someone noted this was a disadvantage, claiming he/she then had to turn the tablet back on. I find this turn off function when taken out of the dock and advantage. I&rsquo;m done with the task,remove the tablet, and it&rsquo;s off.2.) The comment that it has no magnetic &ldquo;off&rdquo; contact when closing the cover does not happen on my cover. If the tablet is on and I put it in the keyboard cover and close it, it turns the tablet off.When using the keyboard cover, place it in the dock, and it turns on the tablet. Remove the tablet, it turns off. Turn the tablet on while outside the cover, put it in the cover, close the cover, it turns the tablet off.3.) It runs off the Tablet power. I can&rsquo;t tell you how frustrating it is to have a keyboard need charging independently from the tablet. One less thing to have to charge..4.) The lack of blue tooth hook up, noted in another review is a plus. The direct connection eliminates the independent power need of the keyboard.And, for anyone who has ever used a tablet blue tooth keyboard, the constant lost bluetooth connection and need to resync is a big problem.5.) The keyboard has a nice feel6.) The cover has a holder for the pen.7.) I have not had the problem of the tablet sliding out of the cover. I have tried to reproduce the tablet sliding out, described by the other review. I have to either hard drop it into a knapsack, or smack it on the side. Maybe I&rsquo;m more careful, or less abusive. In either case, in one week of daily use, the tablet has never slipped out of the case.What the tablet keyboard is not, is a full sized keyboard. It is cramped. But the key detention and feel is good.Remember, this is not a lap top or a full sized keyboard. It is for use with a 9.7 inch tablet. Big enough to be useful, too small for full productivity.What it isn&rsquo;t is a big, comfortable keyboard. However, it functions perfectly without a hitch. No bluetooth delay or need to sync.Someone noted the color. I got the silver Tab S3, the grey cover is perfect.What I don&rsquo;t like is that It is kind of pricey.I&rsquo;m giving it five stars because honestly think it is about as good as any tablet keyboard I have had and does the job. I have read multiple criticisms on review sites. I do think many reviewers believe that applying an unrealistic standard and expectation to a device elevates the reviewer&rsquo;s standing among those who believe that every device must provide a quantum leap in technology. This is a tablet keyboard. It turns the device on when connect, off when disconnected, and off if the device is placed in the cover.Ok, lots of words.Short and sweet. Bright, light, fast, fully capable Android tablet. It meets my needs better than any other Android on the market. And for the people who point out the slightly brighter and faster Google Pixel C, remember, no GPS and it’s heavier.The keyboard integrates perfectly and works.If you want more processing power and more RAM, you need to go Apple. But, they have no SD card and you are stuck in the Apple system.I give the entire system five stars. For the moment, although pricey, this is one of the best out there.Update on 4/29/17Many reviewers note that the tablet does not have a pen holder. There is one on the keyboard. I just got the yueton 5pcs Self-adhesive Leather Pen Holder with Elastic Loop for Notebooks, Journals, Planners and Calendarsyueton 5pcs Self-adhesive Leather Pen Holder with Elastic Loop for Notebooks, Journals, Planners and Calendarshttps://www.amazon.com/yueton-Self-adhesive-Notebooks-Journals-Calendars/dp/B01N8X33Y9/ref=cm_rdp_productHere&rsquo;s my review. It works very well.I got the Samsung tab S3 with the pen. The cover has a pen holder, but the tablet does not.What to do?I got this and placed it on the tablet. Now, my tablet has a pen holder. It is the perfect size.What don&rsquo;t i like, it would be nice if there was a color other than black, and the elastic holder for the pen is not totally flush to the leather making it a little &ldquo;proud.&ldquo;But, as they say, lots of bang for the buck. And easy to put on and use.</p>

<h5 id="best-tablet-ever-totally-worth-it-only-if-you-know-how-to-use">Best tablet ever (totally worth it) only if you know how to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just amazingI have owned iPad air2, iPad mini (latest version), and iPad Pro (12.9inch) with apple pencil and keyboard.I feel like this is the best tablet I have ever used especially the pen that comes with S3 is just insane.It is just amazingly good. It is located somewhat between laptop and typically tablets (including ipad).Many many new and great features that I have never experienced from tablets (even including samsung&rsquo;s previous tablets)Great value if you know how to use it.However given its price I won&rsquo;t recommend it for everyone.Don&rsquo;t buy if you just want to use it for internet browsing. It is waste of money.Buy if you will use your tablet for writing, drawing, games, or business purposes.Pro- The pen that is offered with tablet is incredibly sensitive, noise free and charging/connection free.I didn&rsquo;t expect much since it is basically free. However this works so good that I feel like I&rsquo;m writing on my notebook.Palm rejection works flawlessly and interact seamlessly (I found it acts even better than apple pencil. S-pen&gt;&gt;apple pencil &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surface pro pen, iPad compatible 3rd party pen)Best thing is that you don&rsquo;t need to separately connect or charge.What I found most annoying with apple pencil was that I have to connect once a while with my ipad by sticking its end to the charging part. It doesn&rsquo;t take long but it got annoying after repeating it three times. Also charging it separately was really bad because you have to literally charge ipad and apple pencil separately once every three days.Another good thing is that it is noise free.When I write with my Apple pencil, it makes this noise that you hear when you knock the window with your fingernail. I get used to it but people around me didn&rsquo;t get used to it and found it distracting. (Someone actually pointed out to me after the meeting saying that it is too loud.)This kept me from using it for writing in a meeting (especially in a quite meeting).Lastly the pen is capable of so many things that you never even think of. For example you can literally crop and make your own video by just drawing rectangle on youtube video. You can take the screenshot and draw on it or extract only text (great for screencapturing a book page). You can also write on the screen when the screen is off (very useful for writing down in a meeting) The pen has a little click button on the side which acts somewhat like the right mouse button and this gives you a lot of freedom.- Very very fast processing/ good uiUnlike other android tablets, this does act very fast. I found a lot of android based tablets lack the smoothness of overall operation that I experience with ipad. It seems like samsung did change the android ui somewhat in their own methods to create a better user interface.I also like that it gives me freedom to modify with multiple widgets. I know all android tablets offer this feature but the problem is that none of android tablets were fast enough to really give this feature work. It literally took 3 seconds for me to refresh my background.Tab S3 does this flawlessly and I can take advantage of all the widget features without any waiting time.Adding onto this, it has many many features that iPad doesn&rsquo;t offer. For example it has multiple keyboard shortcut preset that lets you open apps or do actions literally without touching the screen which gives me extra freedom.Multi window works flawlessly for all apps. What I didn&rsquo;t like about ipad multi tasking (open two programs at the same time) was that it only works for the app that supports this feature. For example I cannot write down a note on a note app while I read ebook since my ebook reading software didn&rsquo;t support this feature.I know this feature is more of android thing not the galaxy specific thing but I used multiple android tablet and a lot of them were so slow that this feature was literally useless. This tablet finally made this feature work in a way it was supposed to be.- Lots of useful softwares come with it or you can install for free from its own app storeFor example, MS office comes free.It is not a big deal since you can use it from ipad as well but unless your company pays for it you have to pay for the subscription fee. I&rsquo;m happy that this tablet comes free with the MS office.Also it has several apps that I can use my pen with. (Coloring app or memo app etc ) Some of these apps were only available for the purchase in iPad. I&rsquo;m glad that it comes with free apps that I can take advantage of using the pen.One thing to note is that Samsung somehow made their own app store (galaxy app) which offers you a lot of apps for free (not all apps are free though). Some of these freely available apps are actually sold for $4.99 etc in google play store. Make sure you check this galaxy app store before you purchase something from google store. I- keyboard feels pretty good.I purchased a keyboard accessory that Samsung sells with the S3. Typing feels quite good and I like that it has a language button for people who use multiple languages. Also I was surprised that it is really easy to put the table to the keyboard. I guess it is magnet but it seems like this has magnet in a lot larger area than iPad and it adheres to S3 really well.As mentioned above this tablet lets you use many many shortcuts. I am not sure whether this shortcut works for the third party keyboard though. At least for the samsung keyboard it works really well. You can see the list of preset shortcut by pushing magnifier button (next to ctrl) and / button together-Expandable with SD cardIt is good feature that you can expand the storage. (i&rsquo;m not sure whether you can install the software on sd card. I think I can but I&rsquo;m just not sure how to specify)Cons- ExpensiveI bought it only because I knew that I could return if I don&rsquo;t like it. (I think I will keep it since it is really good. )However I cannot say it is not expensive.Compared to iPad pro, i think it is still cheaper given that it comes with a pen (which is a lot better than apple pencil ) but not everyone purchase iPad pro. If you want a tablet for simple game or internet browsing this is not the tablet you want. If you want to draw or write or use it for business purpose I would strongly recommend this.-for keyboard cover there is a room for improvementkeyboard cover you cannot change the angle, the pen holder seems a bit weak.You cannot take photos with Samsung cover on using the back camera. But again it is attached to the cover using magnet and you just need to pick up the tablet like you pick up the paper from the desk .(very easy) Still it poses another barrier for taking photos. Since I don&rsquo;t usually take photos using tablet I don&rsquo;t find this that annoying.-no pen holder unless you buy a keyboard cover. I am not sure why they didn;t put magnet and extractable clip to be able to attach it to the ablet itself.- A lot of amazingly good features are hidden.I wish they release an official video of how to fully take advantage of all features available. For example you can write a memo when the screen is off but to do so you have to hit the screen while clicking the side button of the pen. (I figured it out accidentally.) I bet a lot of people will not figure this out on their own because this feature is all new. (you don&rsquo;t expect to be able to write on ipad when it is turned off. )I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t know. I bet it has more features but I just didn&rsquo;t discover yet.(I may never get to discover..) Samsung seriously needs better marketing.</p>
