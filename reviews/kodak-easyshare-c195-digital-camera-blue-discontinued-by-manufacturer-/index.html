<h5 id="okay-camera-takes-good-pictures-has-shutter-guard-problems-and-insurance-coverage-is-worthless">Okay Camera, Takes Good Pictures, Has Shutter Guard Problems and Insurance Coverage is Worthless.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered 2 Kodak Easyshare C195 Cameras for use by our mechanics in the shop to photograph the delivery, disassembly, repair and reassembly of pumps and turbines. The cameras have been somewhat sturdy cameras which could accept some drops and bumps. But the last 3 cameras that we have purchased have stopped working properly after about 9 months to the extent that the camera shutter guard will not open. It makes no difference if you manually open the shutter guard, it will not extend the lens and allow you to turn it on. Funny thing is that if you want to just review the pictures taken, you are unable to because the shutter guard will not open, so you can not view the pictures that you have already taken. The Serial Number is located on the bottom of the camera that easily rubs off, which is needed when sending off repairs.Don&rsquo;t purchase the SquareTrade insurance because I do not know what it covers. I purchased the insurance and have called SquareTrade to report a broken camera and they told me to send it to UnitedCamera.com which I did, but they could not repair and could not find the Serial Number. They have sent me back the camera saying it couldn&rsquo;t be repaired. Save the $19.99 for 3 years coverage, it is just a waste of money.</p>

<h5 id="blue-easyshare-c190-when-it-first-came-out-and-love-it-i-ve-been-using-it-for-six-years">&hellip; blue Easyshare C190 when it first came out and love it. I&rsquo;ve been using it for six years &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a blue Easyshare C190 when it first came out and love it. I&rsquo;ve been using it for six years or so and have been very pleased with it. It&rsquo;s simple to use, very versatile and takes sharp, colorful pictures. It&rsquo;s still working perfectly but when I saw these C195s for this great price, I decided to buy one as a backup to my C190 and for nostalgic reasons. It&rsquo;s the last genuine Kodak I&rsquo;ll ever have the chance to buy. This C195, like my C190, is an outstanding little point and shoot camera. I&rsquo;ve read comments about the software and the fact that there is no more Kodak Gallery. The software is irrelevant. Just insert an SD card into the slot in the battery compartment. After you&rsquo;ve taken photos, remove the card and put it in the SD slot of your computer. Then save your photos to your hard drive, a CD or whatever. I then select the photos I want and upload them to my Shutterfly account and order prints. This camera is beautifully designed and constructed. Order a Case Logic case for it, some Amazon Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, an SD card and you&rsquo;ll have a great little traveling companion for many years.</p>

<p>Seemed like a nice camera, but when I received it I found out that Kodak no longer support this model. Returned the camera, fast credit from supplier.</p>

<h5 id="not-easy-at-all-to-share">Not EASY at all to share!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a really poor quality camera phone, but who likes to post pictures directly to Facebook. I though, &ldquo;This is the perfect small camera for her! The &ldquo;Share&rdquo; button will simplify her life!&rdquo; No&hellip;First of all, do not make the foolish mistake I made. I assumed you could &ldquo;Share&rdquo; anyplace there was wifi. No. You STILL have to connect the phone via USB, which in essence makes the &ldquo;Share&rdquo; button pointless&hellip;even it if DID work&hellip;Apparently, Windows upgraded their security and it blocks this from connecting as a camera automatically. You will get an error message. So, after trying a few different sites, a patch was finally downloaded that updated the software. The camera, itself, didn&rsquo;t even COME with installation drivers&hellip;which is dumb on many levels.I can&rsquo;t even say this camera takes great pictures, because as of this rating I haven&rsquo;t seen any of them&hellip;still waiting for them to be posted. Hopefully, at least the small size and good picture quality will convince my friend that her problems gettting the damn thing recognized wasn&rsquo;t all in vain.In essence, if you are looking for an easy, wifi capable, Facebook camera&hellip;this just isn&rsquo;t it. I don&rsquo;t know what I should have gotten, but I&rsquo;m very sad this gift turned out to be so much trouble!</p>

<p>So far, I am pleased with this digital camera. Regular AA batteries don&rsquo;t last long, but went to AA Lithium batteries and no problems. I like the 3&rdquo; screen and picture taking is easy. Pictures are clear and sharp.</p>

<h5 id="no-software-therefore-no-easyshare-otherwise-good-camera-and-good-value">No Software! Therefore, no EasyShare. Otherwise good camera and good value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The software is no longer available. It does not come with software, but directs you to Kodak&rsquo;s website, which says &ldquo;KODAK EASYSHARE Software is no longer available as a download. We regret any inconvenience to you.&rdquo; They stopped supporting the software in March 2013, so why it was still sold as an &ldquo;easyshare&rdquo; camera with all the sharing features (email, facebook, etc) for the Christmas 2013 season and beyond is inexcusable. So, the little red button on the camera for easyshare does nothing because the required software can no longer be downloaded! (I&rsquo;m not sure upon more reading that it really did anything besides upload for you&hellip;it might not have been that useful anyway. I don&rsquo;t think it had any intended wireless capability, just uploading to your preferred location when you upload to your computer.)As for ease of use, I got it for my four year old as it is no doubt much higher quality than toy cameras after reading those reviews. I occasionally even snap a picture with it for myself if I don&rsquo;t have my &ldquo;real&rdquo; camera handy. The picture quality is not exceptional but probably quite good for the level camera it is. There are very few buttons and options and a nice large screen, which is what I wanted for my four year old. She really enjoys it and figured out how to use it and see her pictures right away. One thing I like is that the flash is easy to turn off when you need to (button dedicated to flash - not buried in a menu).If it weren&rsquo;t for the misleading marketing and I was taking price into account, I would give it a pretty high rating because it is an easy to use camera and it was very inexpensive.</p>
