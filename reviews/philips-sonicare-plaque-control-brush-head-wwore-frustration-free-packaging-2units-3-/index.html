<li>Ultra soft bristles to deliver a gentle, yet effective cleaning</li>

Uniquely designed with ultra soft bristles, the Philips Sonicare Sensitive brush head is soft on teeth and gums, yet effective on plaque. The ultra soft bristles combined with a new curved bristle field provide less pressure on teeth and gums. The brush head includes reminder bristles to ensure brush head replacement every 3 months as recommended by the American Dental Association. A fresh brush head every 3 months maximizes the effectiveness of Philips’ unique Sonicare technology.</p>

<h5 id="in-comparison">In Comparison</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as I hate paying over $8 a toothbrush head, these are the softest and best heads you can get - and the softer the better when it comes to your toothbrush heads. Stiffer bristles lead to gum recession and damage.Each of these three brush heads comes with it&rsquo;s own cover as well, so you can keep your brush clean and free of dirt and debris.I attached photos comparing the brush head with the standard Sonicare brush head and the diamond clean brush head. Also note that unlike the cheap knock-off&rsquo;s, these are made in the USA in Washington.I&rsquo;ll update with how long these last. However, my brush heads typically last twice as long due to use of a natural toothpaste (coconut oil and baking soda) that isn&rsquo;t as harsh on the bristles (or your teeth).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="longer-softer-brush-for-the-sonicare">Longer, softer brush for the Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These brushes fit my Philips Sonicare perfectly. I didn&rsquo;t install the family-&ldquo;ID&rdquo; ring that can color code each head if you share a unit, but the brush fit perfectly on the stem, but with a slight gap for that ID ring. The bristle head part is longer than the standard ones that came with my unit, and softer. I like these a lot! I can get way into the back, and inside the gumline on the lingual side (buccal is cheek-side, lingual is tongue-side with respect to your teeth. The &ldquo;lingual&rdquo; side is hard to brush! But that&rsquo;s where trouble can start, even with flossing and brushing with a good electronic toothbrush.)The three brushes come in one of those nasty clamshell packs that require careful cutting, laser-drilling followed by hooking up a winch and a come-along to extract them from the package. And yet, even with these precautions (mesh gloves, eye protective helmet) you still can get a nasty cut on your finger as you struggle to extract these from the packaging. I use a good pair of package-opening shears and still, it was a pain to open this package.The anti-pilfering packaging is completely unnecessary as every drugstore in our area keeps these behind lock and key, and who can reach through the monitor to steal these from Amazon? I wish they were packaged in a humane manner. Hello, Philips! Anyone listening? Have a easy-open option for people who order online, eh?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-and-soft">Nice and soft</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Long story short, I once had a Sonicare Elite model which had very rough bristles and only one type of head choice. The toothbrush was actually painful to brush my teeth with. Upon finding these, I switched over to the Sonicare Easyclean model and bought myself a 3-pack of these to go along with it. So far they are great. The bristles are very soft and gentle, but still do a good job cleaning. They are not rough on the gums like the other Sonicare heads. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has had sensitive gums like me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-brush-head-for-the-philips-sonicare">The Perfect Brush Head for the Philips Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ran into these soft Philips brush heads by accident&ndash;I had been using the standard brush heads for years&ndash;when I was looking to find a set of replacements at a local store. I purchased the Diamond tip Philips Sonicare brush heads, and for the first time in using my Philips device after years, I found I could not use it because the Diamond Head design was much, much to hard. This brush head left my gums so sore that I had to stop using the brush. I returned them and started looking again for my standard brush heads that I had always used.When I found these soft heads, I was quite surprised, as I had never heard of their existence. And because of my recent experience with the overly hard Diamond style, I now wondered if these soft bristles would be bad in the opposite end of the spectrum, something like puting a wet mop in my mouth.Well, all I can say is that after using these for a few months, they have easily become my FAVORITE brush head for the Philips device. The brush cleans exceptionally well (I can see no difference in cleaning ability from the original brush), but they are so much more gentle on the gums. And because that is true, brushing for longer (when I want to) is not a problem. These strike just the right balance, and I am now so happy that I discovered these.These brush heads also seem to have the same life span of the original brushes. It must be remembered that ANY brush head is to be replaced after three months, and there has been no evidence that I have seen that these wear out any faster than the other stiffness brushes.An easy five stars.</p>

<h5 id="stick-to-the-name-brand-that-is-made-for-your-brush">Stick to the name brand that is made for your brush.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked for a cheaper off brand for my Sonicare, but I have really sensitive gums and NEED the ultra soft brush heads. It sucks that they only come in a three pack, but they really are the best. I found some off brands with decent reviews, but then there were some awful reviews and I just didn&rsquo;t want to risk it. I prefer these, because they are super soft and a small enough brush head for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wonderful-medium-sized-head">wonderful medium sized head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these heads. I have a small mouth for an adult (my dentist always complains), so when these arrived I compared them to my two heads that came with my base- a compact and a standard. These are a happy medium between the two. The bristles also feel more like the bristles of the spinny polishing tool the dentist uses, which I prefer over the regular bristles of other heads. I&rsquo;d recommend these to anyone who has trouble getting their brush back behind their molars who appreciates nice, smooth, fresh from the dentist teeth. :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-like-where-they-injected-the-plastic-into-the-mold">Looks like where they injected the plastic into the mold</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind the stiffer bristles. My main complaint is there is a sharp nub about half way down the shaft. Looks like where they injected the plastic into the mold. This numb is SHARP it cut my lip. not a big deal i just used my pocket knife and scraped it off on all 3 heads. But if i am paying 20+ dollars on some plastic brush heads i shouldn&rsquo;t have to whittle down the brush head before use.</p>
