<h5 id="wow-is-that-noise-coming-from-the-machine">Wow is that noise coming from the machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When it came I loved this it is a very simple Blu-Ray player. I don&rsquo;t want apps or fancy User Interfaces (Samsung is way to busy with its UI). Any way love 4k however there is as of yet limited content. the reason I got this was I have a LG TV.After getting my Second 4k movie (Figured first disc was bad as that blu-ray playback is nice and quite) I found out I got one that buzzes during 4k play back. This is not an Audio out issue or anything to do with HDMI. The Drive in the device is really loud. Called LG Customer service seemed less than helpful. Referred to Lotus International Company. I will update this review with the outcome.UPDATE: 8/4/2017 - I did not save the box for this player, first time in my life I did not do this. A box arrived today from LG, lots of bubble wrap and a shipping label. Unit has been boxed and will ship on 8/7/2017UPDATE 8/22/2017 - Called as that &ldquo;Turn Around Time&rdquo; could be up to ten days. The representative did not understand what I wanted and told me that I should have received the unit. After working through dates and tracking numbers, she did see that the delivery status was for the delivery of the unit to LG. She now indicates that upon further review &ldquo;Brief Hold&rdquo; The unit is in need of parts and will be in the repair shop for up to 22 business days. Next Update 9/21/2017 &mdash;&ndash; Really?UPDATE 8/30/2017 - Well the Player has been returned and the same problem exists, so disappointed. so far the the only thing LG has done is added scratches to the unit. Called LG and was advised the unit would need to be repaired again. I will get this in the mail by 8/31/2017 and see what the next round brings.</p>

<p>LG UP970 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray Player with HDR Compatibility (2017)I wanted a 4K player and decided on this one because of the promised Dolby Vision firmware update later in 2017. Also, my TV is made by LG, so I hoped for good compatibility.The image quality is excellent. I have read many reviews about 4K HDR being very dark. I had a problem with dark video from the Arrival 4K disk, but the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 4K disk looked amazing. I worked on the video calibration for the TV, and the dark issues went away. Arrival look pristine after that. At couch distance, 4K is incredible. I can even stand with my nose a few inches from the TV and see only slight pixelation. Blu-rays and DVDs also look good.I only use this player to play disks. I don&rsquo;t use it for WiFi or LAN streaming, so I can&rsquo;t comment on those features.There are two things keeping me from a five-star review: the remote control, and the set up. The remote control seems a bit unresponsive. Sometimes it seems fine. Sometimes it responds, but slowly. Other times I have to really mash a button to get the signal to the player. It is definitely the weakest remote I own. I&rsquo;m working on setting up a universal remote, which will make the weak remote a non-issue soon.The problem I had with set up was the audio output. There are two HDMI outputs and one optical output. The HDMI outputs are labeled &ldquo;HDMI 1 OUT TO TV&rdquo; and &ldquo;HDMI 2 AUDIO ONLY.&rdquo; So I used one HDMI cable to the TV, and the &ldquo;AUDIO OUT&rdquo; HDMI cable to the receiver. I could see the movie on my TV, but hear nothing from my speakers. The way the user guide is written makes it semi-useful but a kind of confusing. I tried the optical output instead. No luck. I went back to the HDMI output and guessed at settings between the UP970 player and the receiver until I got the sound to work. I&rsquo;m not sure if this was really a problem with the player or the receiver.Overall I would recommend this player. Movies look beautiful. I&rsquo;m hoping for even better performance with a universal remote and the Dolby Vision update.</p>

<h5 id="dolbyvision-update-promised">Dolbyvision update promised</h5>

<p>Uhd 4k blu ray Movies coming out soon encoded with Dolbyvision HDR will also have HDR10 embedded so you&rsquo;ll still enjoy high quality color without the DV update. That being said, the programs available on Netflix that are offered in Dolbyvision are superior in my opinion to the HDR10 versions.I purchased this unit because I&rsquo;m so pleased with my LG Oled TV I wanted to stay with the same manufacturer. The user interface is much more intuitive compared to my Samsung Ubd-K8500.I&rsquo;ve also encountered lip-sync audio timing issues with the Sammy that haven&rsquo;t appeared on the LG player. Others have reported the same intermittent issue. The audio timing can be adjusted but it&rsquo;s annoying.I purchased my player locally.I&rsquo;m not associated with this product.I received nothing for my review.I recommend this product over the UBD-K8500</p>

<p>Â Great picture and sound quality but the motor makes a very loud constant buzzing noise that you can hear while the movie is playing.</p>

<h5 id="distracting-vibration-noise">Distracting Vibration/Noise&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like others have mentioned, it has a very obvious vibration which in results in a very loud noise as a result. This only seem to happen with movies with the &ldquo;Ultra HD Premium&rdquo; logo. My other 4K (John Wick, Creed, and Lego Batman) played quietly as expected. I contacted LG, but really no help and simply asked me to describe the cover of the disc in question and advised that it could be resolved with a future update. Note, the disc was &ldquo;The Martian Extended Version&rdquo; which also had a bluray version of which played fine. Again the &ldquo;Ultra HD Premium&rdquo; 4K disc has the issue. Lastly I replaced it twice, to ensure it was not simply a bad disc and still the same result.</p>
