<h5 id="great-premium-feel-portable-keyboard">Great Premium feel portable keyboard!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The build of this keyboard is aluminum with some plastic pieces, like the stand for the tablets or phones. It feels strong and in no way cheap in the contrary it feels very premium. I was astonished by the engineering used in this keyboard. They key press are like using a MacBook air. Is very easy to connect to is just like any other Bluetooth device, except this one you can connect to 3 different devices and can switch between them with a press of a button. It connects to all of them once you open the device, since it the way you turn it on. The touch pad is very responsive and it has a left and right dedicated click buttons. It also has an FN-Functions. Overall, I really liked this product and I am going to used it a lot with my tablet in my classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-problems-related-to-the-product-thus-far">No problems (related to the product) thus far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works as advertised, I got the white one just because I carry a lot of stuff around around with me, and with everything in my bag I find that having everything black makes it harder to see and grab quickly.Typing on it is about as you&rsquo;d expect, only slightly smaller than most laptop keyboards, so most people won&rsquo;t have a problem. I have giant hands, so while it&rsquo;s not the most comfortable for me personally, I understand the tradeoff needed for portability. I had another folding keyboard that was the same design, but no touchpad. The touchpad adds significant cost, but the functionality is well worth it.The bluetooth switching is also awsome, going tablet to phone (android) is a matter of a couple of seconds, this is a killer feature.My only complaints are that the &ldquo;zerolemon&rdquo; branding on the spacebar is a little big (being very nitpicky here obviously), and I really wanted backlighting. I knew this would not have it, but searching did not turn up a backlit option with everything else this one had.Would recommend, and have already to a few freinds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="portable">Portable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I always bring a tablet device with me in case I need to do work impromptu. With tablets the touch keyboard on screen is always difficult to use quickly for emails, etc. If you do a lot of typing you will know that nothing can replace the feel of a press keyboard. I love the convenient size of this. It&rsquo;s portable and comes with a velvet drawstring bag for protection. The stand that is attached and folds down for portability is strong and easily holds up my iPad mini without problems. The look of the keyboard is aesthetically clean and professional. I use it all the time but especially when I know I need to do a lot of typing and don&rsquo;t have my laptop with me. It&rsquo;s perfect in size and the price is not that expensive for the quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-advertised">As advertised!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Guess what is being used to type this review?Pros:Folding mechanism is well made and sturdyAble to link with up to three devicesTwo finger scrolling works with Android devicesComes with a nice velvet carrying caseCon:&ldquo;?&rdquo; is a fn key. Since it was commonly used in chats, wish it could have been on a dedicated key by itselfThe stands are spaced too far apart for my 8&rdquo; tablet. Not too big of an issue though.Definitely for those who do lots of typing on their phones or tablet!</p>

<h5 id="small-but-nice">small but nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>high quality with great key &ldquo;feel&rdquo;. Just a little small for me to be comfortable. A somewhat larger version would be awesome.</p>

<p>not sure about longer term reliability..works as advertised..took seconds to set up and start using&hellip;zero hassles ..great for what i had in mind&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<p>Awesome device. Great seller that cares about your satisfaction.</p>

<h5 id="soooo-close">Soooo close&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is as close as I&rsquo;ve seen to my perfect bluetooth keyboard. I have specifically been looking for a full sized keyboard with a built in touchpad , multi-device pairing, and built in tablet holder. This one is even foldable to boot! I paired it with a galaxy note 5 and galaxy note 3 with no issues. I also paired it with a Dell Venue 8 pro running windows 10.Overall Experience: Typing is accurate with minimal/no lag on all devices I tried it on. However, this is NOT a full sized keyboard (see picutres for comparison with a Spectre x360 (2017) keyboard. Trackpad was accurate. However, for each of these devices, the two tabs for supporting them were too far apart so I ended up standing my phone/tablet up on one support instead of both.Windows: Perhaps unsurprisingly, single touch action was fine. However, multi-touch gestures were supported, but unreliable. Two finger scrolling resulted in right click most of the time.Android: Smooth, no problems thereConclusion: Great keyboard for people with small hands. Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have small hands and the trackpad wasn&rsquo;t accurate enough for me so this is getting returned. That said, if this company makes a full sized folding version with an improved trackpad I&rsquo;d be all in. Until then I&rdquo;m sticking with my logitech k780 with a bluetooth microsoft arc mouse.</p>
