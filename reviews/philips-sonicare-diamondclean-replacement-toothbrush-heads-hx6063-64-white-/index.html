<h5 id="believed-counterfeit">Believed Counterfeit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were purchased directly from Amazon, not a 3rd party retailer but I believe them to be fake. I suffered the same problem as found by many of the 1 star reviewers where one of the two heads makes a terrible noise when in use. So loud it isn&rsquo;t usable. Both heads also have a sharp plastic on the back left over from the molding process. On my old head this molding divot was smooth. The &lsquo;Philips Sonicare&rsquo; logo printed on the head is poorly defined and in lighter print. The metal ring in the base of my old head was pressed into a 3D shape that went up inside the head cavity. On the new one it is just a round 2D washer with sharp edges (probably the cause of the noise). The serial number etching on the metal ring is poorly defined on the new one but clear on my old one. I cannot believe these are real. Philips had no interest in investigating this and just suggested that I drop another $30 to buy some more directly from their store. Poor form Philips and possibly poor form Amazon for selling questionable products. I&rsquo;d skip on these and purchase from a big box retailer. Note that the packaging looks very genuine!</p>

<h5 id="high-bristle-density-compact-size-is-the-perfect-size-top-of-the-line-cleaning-power">High bristle density, compact size is the perfect size, top of the line cleaning power</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these compact Diamond Clean heads after extensively researching Sonicare&rsquo;s confusing line of brush heads, before I actually bought a Sonicare toothbrush. I noticed the Diamond Clean was the most expensive but highly rated tooth brush available, with 7x the cleaning power. I was curious to see what differences (if any) there were with the actual Diamond Clean tooth brush versus a less expensive model such as the Essence or Flexcare series. I quickly found that most of these brush heads are compatible with the Flexcare and Diamond Clean, with the Essence being a low-budget line. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be a difference in performance between the Flexcare Plus or the DIamond Clean, so I ordered and received the Flexcare, and used the compact Diamond Head brush for my teeth.The full sized ProResults brush was too big and I didn&rsquo;t like the feel. The compact Diamond Clean has a much higher bristle density, with lots of tiny bristles packed into an area for maximum cleaning. The smaller size allowed me to focus on tight spots as well as cover the larger surface areas (flat parts of teeth, biting surfaces, etc&hellip;)I was skeptical at first, and I had been using Oral-B&rsquo;s brush system since around 1996, but always knew about Sonicare. I didn&rsquo;t realize how Sonicare really &ldquo;vibrates&rdquo; the tooth brush 31,000 times a minute because I can certainly tell. There are no mechanical moving parts with these brushes, the brush head just &ldquo;vibrates&rdquo; rapidly causing the toothpaste/fluid mixture to agitate and flow through gum lines and in-between teeth, while the brush works gently and rapidly to remove stains/debris from the teeth. Bottom line is that I am truly impressed with the performance of Sonicare.Overall: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars, if you have trouble with Sonicare&rsquo;s full-sized brushes, I highly recommend going with the compact brush heads. They are easier to use, more like Oral-B&rsquo;s precision brush heads. The Diamond Clean works much better than the ProResults brush due to the higher bristle density.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-standard-brush-head">Better than the standard brush head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like these Diamondclean Sonicare brush head&rsquo;s better than the standard Sonicare brush head. The brush head itself is slightly smaller than the normal ones but to me they feel both more powerful and gentle at the same time on my teeth. It feels as though the bristles are softer but there are more of them to do the job. These a little more expensive than the 3 pack standard Sonicare brush head&rsquo;s but I am going to stick with them because they feel better on my teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-of-the-brush-heads-vibrates-off-the-main-body">One of the brush heads vibrates off the main body</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The heads will not stay on. Soon as I replaced it I noticed that it was way to easy to install. When you turn the brush on the head will vibrate loose. Not sure if these are a new design or knockoffs but very much disappointed. Does anyone have the same issue or did I receive defective heads.UPDATE: after reading bunch of reviews I inspected all three heads and noticed they have these markings on them. One is a triangle, the other a rectangle and the third is a circle. These markings are to identify the heads when the unit is shared. Now the triangle and rectangle heads are solid and fit tight and do not vibrate off the main body. So the only defective head is the one with the circle marking. I have reached out to sonicare on their Facebook page. They commented right away saying they will get in touch. so hopefully someone will get back soon.HOW TO FIX: take a tiny section of some food plastic wrap put it over the shaft and insert the loose brush head. done.</p>

<p>Tried other fake ones and they fall apart very fast and don&rsquo;t clean as well as the original. Don&rsquo;t buy other than the original. 5 stars, expensive - 4 stars</p>

<p>$15 per head is ridiculous. Make a 6 pack for ~$20, and I&rsquo;ll try them again.They also seem to wear out quickly.</p>

<p>Great product. Exactly what I wanted and the exact same thing as the original head that came with my toothbrush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bad-quality-product">Bad quality product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a good product. The brush is making so much noise when operated and doesn&rsquo;t feel like the original brush. I do not recommend purchasing this product here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, they are toothbrush heads. They fit fine and work well. We use this with our sonicare heads that just slip on. A bit pricy, but we don&rsquo;t have much of a choice.</p>
