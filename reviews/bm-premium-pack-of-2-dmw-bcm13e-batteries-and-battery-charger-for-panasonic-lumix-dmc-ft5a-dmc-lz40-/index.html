<h5 id="the-batteries-and-charger-seems-to-work-just-fine-fine-and-i-haven-t-had-the-problem-with-batteries">The batteries and charger seems to work just fine fine and I haven&rsquo;t had the problem with batteries &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries and charger work fine, but the battery capacity isn&rsquo;t any different from stock. I haven&rsquo;t had the problem with batteries falling out of the charger yet that some have. However the listing claims that the battery is higher capacity than the stock battery. My testing indicated that this is not true. To test this I first weighed the battery and its weight was the same as my stock battery to the best my scale would read (one tenth oz). Lithium is an alkali metal so larger capacity batteries should weigh more. This made me suspicious enough to go the next step and test it in the camera. I set up the camera on a tripod to take time laps flash photos of the same seen until the battery capacity was exhausted. All batteries were fully charged at the start with the same &ldquo;BM Premium&rdquo; charger, the camera was set to the same mode and was set to shut down between flash photos. The stock battery (1250 mAh) shot 212 pictures before it quit, the &ldquo;BM Premium&rdquo; shot 209 photos before it quit which is close enough to indicate that it is probably just a stock battery that has been relabeled. A third battery I tested &ldquo;Kastar&rdquo; which claimed to be 1800 mAh also shot 209 photos before it quit. So while these batteries seem to work fine, they are most likely nothing more than relabeled stock batteries.</p>

<h5 id="worked-well-on-my-travels-abroad">Worked well on my travels abroad&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this charger and battery set to supplement the one battery that came with the camera and the requirement by Panasonic to charge the battery in the camera. The MAH were a little higher with these new batteries and they lasted a little longer than the Panasonic original. The charger came with a European adapter which worked well while travelling in Italy. The charger did not have any issues charging the original Panasonic battery, but I would not expect any issues as the battery specifications should be the same. I really did not pay attention to time it took to complete a recharge cycle as I would hook it up before bed and it was done before morning. A feature I would have liked on this charger is a USB charging port. It seems outlets in Italian hotel rooms are usually limited to one here or there and it would be nice to have a USB port to charge a phone or another device built into the charger.</p>

<h5 id="inexpensive-fully-compatible-batteries-for-the-panasonic-lumix-dmz-zs40-camera">Inexpensive, fully compatible batteries for the Panasonic Lumix DMZ-ZS40 camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product. Supplies 2 additional, compatible batteries, a charger that allows charging batteries outside the camera and seem to have comparable storage and longevity as the Panasonic OEM battery supplied with the Panasonic Lumix DMZ-ZS40 camera.</p>

<h5 id="battery-holder-comes-loose-and-one-battery-has-poor-capacity">Battery holder comes loose, and one battery has poor capacity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You get what you pay for. The battery charger &ldquo;works&rdquo;. It is composed of two pieces. One part plugs into the wall, the other part clips onto it, and holds the battery. I assume the plug in part is universal, and they pair it with the appropriate battery adapter. The problem I have is the battery holder doesn&rsquo;t stay attached well. A slight bump and the battery holder detaches from the plug in half. I may try tape or super glue to remedy that problem. Unfortunately, one of the two batteries does not hold as much charge as the other. One battery is actually quite good, or at least as good as the stock Panasonic battery. The other battery only provides about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the use before I need to recharge it. I&rsquo;ve gone through about 4 charge cycles on each, hoping that might improve the capacity but no improvement. I did not get a chance to try out the 12 volt car charging adapter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="compatible-with-panasonic-zs30">Compatible with Panasonic ZS30</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical of this product because there were no reviews. I went to the states without my charger and overnighted this set hoping it would work.This is a great deal, especially for the price. Not only does it work, but the batteries last just as long as the original battery. That and it didn&rsquo;t catch my camera on fire. I now have 3 functional batteries AND the option to charge outside of the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well">works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>batteries last longer than the OEM ones. This works perfectly in our Panasonic ZS30 even though I read somewhere these cameras only work with OEM batteries. perfect!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries and charger work for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS50. The two batteries included with the charger are 3.6V, 1500mAh, 5.4Wh versus the one that came with the camera whose specs are 3.6Vm, 1250mAh, 4.5Wh. So far they seem to perform as well as the original Panasonic but I can&rsquo;t tell for sure since the two times I&rsquo;ve used the different ones involved different operating conditions.</p>

<h5 id="great-customer-service-experience-from-the-seller-big-mikes">Great customer service experience from the seller&ndash; Big Mikes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this in May 2016 to have a charger for a big trip so that I would not have to leave my camera out to charge the batteries. Between these 2 new batteries and the oem that came with the camera, I ended up taking only one of the new batteries and using that as my spare. The other new Big Mike battery sat in a drawer until a week or so ago, and when I tried to charge it, the unused battery couldn&rsquo;t hold even a little charge. I wrote to Big Mike to see id I could return/exchange the battery, which I concluded had been defective.Big Mike&rsquo;s reps wrote me back immediately and said that the batteries need to be charged up, even if I don&rsquo;t use them right away and that the battery died bc it had never been used or charged. Who knew? I thought the battery would last longer if I didn&rsquo;t initialize it!And then Big Mike&rsquo;s surprised me: they sent me a brand new replacement battery, didn&rsquo;t even want me to send the unused but dead one. Big Mike&rsquo;s, your customer service is awesome, thank you!</p>
