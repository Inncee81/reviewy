<blockquote>
<p>Before I start this review, I would like to say that this is completely independent and from someone who has run the gamut on portable speakers. I&rsquo;m going to do my best to remain unbiased and compare to other portable speakers I&rsquo;ve used (and there are A LOT of them), but I honestly think that what Soundfreaq has done with the Sound Kick is unparalleled. The cost, portability, and sound quality that this speaker brings is what I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of but inevitably have had to make sacrifices until now. To preface, I&rsquo;ve traveled extensively with this speaker and have been using for close to 3 months now. So, on we go&hellip;When I first heard about this speaker back in May, I couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere. I went to four different Target Store locations in the Chicago area (the only place selling it at the time), and they were all sold out. However, I was able to do side-by-side sound tests with both the Soundfreaq Sound Kick and the Bose Soundlink (my other potential choice at the time). I&rsquo;m 100% convinced that I would pick the Soundfreaq Sound Kick in a blind test every single time. And, at the time, it was marked at 1/3rd of the cost of the Bose (the Sound Kick is slightly more expensive now, but worth every cent and then some).I was set to leave the country (permanently) within a week and somewhat discouraged that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bring a Sound Kick with me. So, taking a shot in the dark, I decided to email the company to see if they knew where I might be able to get one close by (and described my situation and VERY limited time). They emailed back almost immediately, and said they&rsquo;d see if they could find one around the office and would send via FedEx just as soon as I replied! Before I knew it, the Sound Kick had arrived with a pretty sweet, and free, Soundfreaq T-Shirt to boot! It was hands down the single greatest customer service experience of my life. With that, their customer service is an testament to their products. A company that takes that kind of time for their (potential) customers assuredly puts even more effort and sound engineering into their products.I read Amazon customer reviews all of the time to help me decide on my electronics, but I have never written one myself. However, the one thing I know well is speakers and, more specifically, travel speakers. I&rsquo;ve spent the better part of a decade living and traveling outside of the US, and I simply couldn&rsquo;t do it without my music. I&rsquo;ve gone through them all: Logitech, Bose, Atec Lansing, Big Blue, Jawbone, Panasonic, etc. The Sound Kick is without a doubt the best travel speaker I have ever used. It&rsquo;s so good that it&rsquo;s completely replaced my need for any other audio system when I&rsquo;m not moving about.So points I&rsquo;d like to highlight, which I&rsquo;ll also compare with some other speakers I&rsquo;ve used:- Sound: The balance is engineered perfectly. I can turn the speaker all the way up, and my iPod all the way up, and there is not even a hint of distortion. This is not just rare with travel speakers, it has been non-existent in my experience (until now). They really took the time to figure out the volume controls and let the speaker give everything it can give without compromising quality. The bass and treble are both perfect&hellip;and the amount of bass you can get will literally astound you. Sure, the floor won&rsquo;t be vibrating, but again, this is a portable speaker, and for my needs, I can get all the bass I could possibly want. The only speaker in this class that has better bass, is the Logitech Boombox. That&rsquo;s what it was built for, and if that&rsquo;s all you want, then go for it. But, the Logitech is much bigger and, in my opinion, bordering the line of what can be considered a &ldquo;portable&rdquo; speaker. Sure, if you&rsquo;re heading to the beach for a day, it&rsquo;s fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t pack that big boy on the long-term trips I take. Also, let&rsquo;s be honest, the Logitech Boombox is really ugly. While the bass may be better, I think there&rsquo;s no comparison. Over all sound quality, the Sound Kick wins without question. Further, This sucker can get LOUD too. I like to blast my music, and this will get you there, and most importantly, the sound will remain CLEAR. Something I can&rsquo;t say about any other speaker in this class. I can fill a large room at a party easily. You&rsquo;ll obviously want more sound with anything bigger than that, but that&rsquo;s the case with any other speaker in this class. It can&rsquo;t perform miracles, but it comes damn close.- Usability: The usability (bluetooth) is fantastic. I love that I just tap the power button and my iPod automatically pairs with it. I hit play and get on with my day. The only other bluetooth travel speaker I can compare to is Big Blue Audio. I really like that speaker too (and keep it at my desk), but the bluetooth function is annoying at best. There are two power buttons, an annoying blue light that never tells you what is actually happening, I have to &ldquo;re-pair&rdquo; with it just about every time I turn it on and hold down the power button forever&hellip;also, it never pairs with the device I want it to pair with. With the Sound Kick, I just hit power and that&rsquo;s it. Pairing a new device is infinitely easier as well. The sound on Big Blue is honestly very good, but the Sound Kick is much better and&hellip;honestly, in an entirely different league. Also, Big Blue is smaller if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for. But, I find the Sound Kick extremely portable, and at the same price point, I simply can&rsquo;t imagine a situation, ever, where I would pick Big Blue over the Sound Kick. With that said&hellip;- Portability. Once the little kickstand/bass boost is pressed in, the Sound Kick is nice and flat, and sits nicely at the bottom of my backpack. It&rsquo;s sturdy without being too heavy. Granted there are lots of other smaller speakers out there, but this is the prefect combination of great sound and portability. If you want that great sound when you travel, you should be prepared for something a little more bulky any way. The Bose Soundlink is much heavier&hellip;not to mention the fact that the sound quality is inferior and it&rsquo;s more than twice the cost. Like I said, Big Blue is smaller&hellip;but again, the sound is worse than the Sound Kick. Further, Big Blue is &ldquo;delicate&rdquo; because it wants to look fancy. The Sound Kick looks really, really sleek in my opinion, but with the metal grate and solid construction, it also feels like it&rsquo;s made to move and take a beating if it has to. The original Jawbone is a complete joke in my opinion (I can&rsquo;t compare newer models). Sure it&rsquo;s portable. But I&rsquo;ve heard better quality from a speaker 1/10th of the cost. Namely, the Altec Lansing Orbit. If it&rsquo;s ultra portability you&rsquo;re after, then that is the speaker for you. It is meant to take a beating, and I still use it often when working in rural locations. But, both the Altec and Jawbone (and perhaps Big Blue) are in a different class. Ultra-portability comes with an extreme reduction in sound quality. If you want one speaker that can handle just about every need, the Soundfreaq Sound Kick is the only speaker to consider.- USB Port: I didn&rsquo;t realize how handy this feature actually is until I started using the speaker on a daily basis. When I&rsquo;m in the field, I can charge my phone, and I use it often to charge my camera and, obviously, my iPod. So much better than a &ldquo;dock&rdquo;. I still use my Altec Lansing often when in rough areas, but it&rsquo;s increasingly becoming replaced by the Sound Kick. Not only is the sound infinitely better, but it&rsquo;s so handy to have the ability to have an extra, multi-use &ldquo;battery pack&rdquo; on hand at any given time.- Range/Battery - Both great. Depending on the space (thick walls, etc), I get the best range compared to the other bluetooth speakers I&rsquo;ve used or tried. I often have the speaker in my office while I&rsquo;m 40-50 feet away with my iPod in the lab without any skips or distortion. Much more than that, and it cuts out, but still the best range I&rsquo;ve seen. The battery life is still not fully tested. I&rsquo;ve run it for a solid 8 hours, and it was still going strong. I take weekend trips often and have stopped brining the charger with me.So&hellip;to sum it all up&hellip;.As far as cost goes, the Sound Kick has made the Bose Soundlink obsolete. At less than half the cost, the Sound Kick has better sound and is more portable. If that&rsquo;s what your comparing it to, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer. With all of the other options and stipulations you might have, here is my analysis in brief:There are numerous subclasses of small/portable speakers with their own strengths and considerations: speakers that are portable, those that are &ldquo;ultra&rdquo;-portable, sleek nightstand speakers, rugged and sturdy travel companions, extremely affordable desktop buddies, docks for your iPod (and only your &ldquo;iPod&rdquo;), those with bluetooth, those with rechargeable batteries, those meant to replace a bulky home audio system, and speakers meant to enhance your puny laptop&rsquo;s capabilities&hellip; and now&hellip;now, there is the Soundfreaq Sound Kick. It fits into all of those categories and then some in its own way and is quite literally in a class of its own.Soundfreaq has redefined what the small speaker can be while compromising almost nothing. The Sound Kick is simultaneously rugged and elegant. It sounds amazing; it&rsquo;s functional and usable; It&rsquo;s portable; It&rsquo;s affordable. I mean&hellip;the list goes on and on. There are very few products that come along that take into account every conceivable consumer desire. What the Sound Kick has done for portable audio is akin to what the iPhone has done for&hellip;well&hellip;you name it.Long story short, the Soundfreaq Sound Kick is, in my opinion, one of the most understated products on the market. It will match and exceed almost any criteria you have for a portable speaker. The bar has been set, and as Soundfreaq inevitably gains a larger and larger following, all of their competitors will begin to scramble and many will come up short. I don&rsquo;t know how they did it, but I&rsquo;m glad that they did!With all of that said, Soundfreaq, currently, is the most accessible and down to earth company I have ever dealt with which makes all of this just that much sweeter. I hope they don&rsquo;t lose that down the line! I mean&hellip;they are making freakin&rsquo; Bose obsolete here&hellip;that&rsquo;s bound to come with some ego. So, Soudfreaq, don&rsquo;t forget who you&rsquo;re designing for and what is making you the leader in portable (dare I say &ldquo;all&rdquo;) speakers.Oh, in the effort to be unbiased, I did want to state the negatives of this speaker. The &ldquo;light bar&rdquo; that is always active when the speaker is turned on is a bit bright. I like to fall asleep to music coming out of my Sound Kick, and that light can be obtrusive in the dead of night. Ummm&hellip;..that is all.</p>

<h5 id="this-box-rocks">This Box Rocks!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered on Friday, delivered (free) the following Monday … OUTSTANDING! Set-up was simple, buttons and connections are self-explanatory. Right out of the box, I began to charge the battery by connecting the AC adapter (12 hours minimum). Pairing was a cinch with the Soundfreaq app, although my Galaxy S3 and Asus tablet readily acquired sans app. The Sound Kick uses a Bose-like baffling chamber to resonate sound. This chamber must be fully extended (exposing a silver mark on the pull-out chamber) to use the unit. Google Play Music and Milk Music played perfectly (and while not a Sound Kick issue, Google Play volume was very muted even with device and speaker volume levels topped out; Milk Music absolutely screamed). Play via the GS3 sounded better with the normal or auto EQ setting, rather than rock/pop or dance. For a small speaker system, the sound is quite remarkable, whether playing classical, country, disco, or metal, the Sound Kick delivered clear, crisp reproductions. Applying the UQ3 spatial enhancement will depend on several factors, including your personal tastes, track mastering, and device EQ settings. The “dance” EQ on my GS3 with a professionally mastered dance mix will push the Kick well past its range, and the UQ3 makes it worse, not that without the UQ3 was much better. The Sound Kick is a mid-range, all around speaker system. You won’t Rock the Casbah with it, but you will Rock the Room! Determining battery usage is based on a blinking or steady red or green light, however I played the Kick for 7.5 hours and the light blinked Red-3 times, signifying a 10-30% charge remaining. If you choose to charge your phone, expect significantly less play time. The Kick’s slim build makes it easy to pack into a laptop bag or backpack. The Kick makes a great rich, full sound enhancement option with slim build, battery/AC power and USB charging, duel Bluetooth/3.5mm connections, for under $100. Perfect for dorms! 5-stars Soundfreaq, well done!</p>

<p>I did weeks of researching before committing. I had it narrowed down to a jbl speaker (which I had had a long time ago and adored) and a few others I can no longer remember. Then I found this guy.Boy, am I glad I found this guy.Despite being easily operable, I thought I had a defective one until I realized you REALLY have to pull the back part <em>all</em> the way out. There were about ten minutes of frustrated huffing and puffing as it kept shutting off before I looked up the online manual and subsequently smacked myself on the forehead.The sound on this is fantastic. I&rsquo;m a snob when it comes to the &ldquo;tinny&rdquo; sound; I have very few issues with this speaker. There are lots of songs that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed certain aspects of until listening to them on the sound kick - favorite part about this speaker, I think.This speaker is proving to be a helpful and vital tool at dance practices, as well. It allows everyone to play the song from their phone without having to constantly go over to the speaker itself to start/stop/rewind/etc the song.Overall, I&rsquo;d definitely suggest this over the options I had been considering - the price is right, the battery life is right, the simplicity in bluetooth hookup is right&hellip; Soundfreaq got a lot of stuff right.</p>
