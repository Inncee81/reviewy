<h5 id="awesome-monitors-i-purchased-3-of-these-with-some">Awesome monitors! I purchased 3 of these with some &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome monitors! I purchased 3 of these with some vesa adapter brackets (They are not really vesa mountable without them) and they work great! The thin bezel really helps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-triple-monitor-setups-diy-vesa-mount-instructions">Perfect for triple monitor setups (DIY Vesa mount instructions)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have made an unboxing video if you wish to watch it: youtu.be/JADWTeYISZQSo far I&rsquo;ve bought three of these things and they look and work great. The monitor itself is 22&rdquo;, but not that the screen is actually only 21.5&rdquo;. Assembly is simple, take out the base, screw the stand into the back with the thumb screw, and then slide the monitor into the base. The monitor has VGA and DVI as input choices, though I wish to see HDMI or Displayport, it&rsquo;s not enough for me to knock off a star. Also no there is no vesa mounting option built into the monitor. There are adapters you can buy that will slide onto the screen and enable it to be mounted, but it still should be noted.Edit: I recently bought a triple monitor stand and have mounted these monitors to the stand. While VESA adapters do exist, they are expensive, so I went with the DIY approach. Total cost was less than $10 total. I got a 10 foot roll of Galvanized Strapping (used to hang pipes from the ceiling), washers, nuts that would fit onto the included vesa screws, and some heavy duty duck tape. Cut pieces of the stripping to match the holes in the vesa mount (I used the smaller 75mm holes). Wrap them in duct tape to prevent scratching the monitor. Put the screw through the holes in the vesa mount and place 2 strips of the strapping on each mount, one across the top pair of holes and one across the bottom. Put a washer over the screw and loosely put a nut on each screw. You should be able to slide the monitor stand into the brackets you just made. Use a pair of pliers and screwdriver to tighten the screws in place. Repeat for each monitor, and make sure that they are tight. I was able to align these vertically and horizontally without them sliding around.</p>

<h5 id="solid-photographer-s-eye-full-true-natural-hd-color-with-no-bleed-or-cross-screen-color-variation">Solid, Photographer&rsquo;s eye full true, natural HD color with no bleed or cross-screen color variation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This came in well protected in a double box, the outer shipping box, wrapped inside with industrial paper and within the manufacturers box. The outer shipping box was a bit banged up but the interior box was fine. The monitor was intact and undamaged and packed well. (Hint save the box, wrap and foam for storage and if you move house). The monitor itself exceeds expectations, passing every online monitor test I could find. The default color is &ldquo;warm&rdquo; and it is slightly &ldquo;less cool&rdquo; than the Samsung 27&rdquo; LED it replaced. Each monitor has it&rsquo;s own slightly different tone within brand and model as well as across them. Visually, the image is clear thus far, no lines, dark spots, light bleed or any thing else. This from a professional photographer and the colors are true to real world.The stand is metal, easy to assemble in seconds and can be done while the actual monitor remains resting within wrap or foam. There are 2 HDMI ports, a VGA and a DVI port. One of the ports is a HDMI-MHL port. The buttons are located lower center right and it gets a bit of getting used to, learning to navigate the menus and explore the options. There is no in-package manual. I could have gone online, if I had chosen to, which I would recommend to the average user. The visual input switch is the leftmost button and will present you with all of the available options, but will default or go back to the active channel if there is only one source. For example with two computers, A &amp; B if you have HDMI-2 on B and you shut it down; it will switch back automatically to HDMI-1 on computer A. The screen is quick to time out when you shut down the system or you lock screen and has no trouble waking up from &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. It does not &ldquo;pop on&rdquo; to check for signal. It has two speakers built into the back, but much like in flatscreen TV-sets, these are not designed to be primary speakers. There are audio in/out jacks (standard headphone sized) in the rear of the machine as well. I was hesitant to buy a little known brand, but this is a very nice monitor and one of the best I&rsquo;ve had. I did pick up the offered warranty for three years; they are well worth it. I&rsquo;ll update this review if any issues arise, but so far 5-stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is a very good monitoer for the price, I was very surprised at how crisp games looked on this thing. the resolution upgrade was a bit more then I had expected, the screen has no dead pixles and dos not stutter I have had this product for a few weeks now.pros. no dead pixleslooks great!priceeasy to reach speaker port.cons, the stock mount dosnt alow for much flexibilityno speakers.I would recommend this product to anybody who wants to up the resolution but still cant afford a 4 or 5 k monitor. keep an eye out for sales it a great addition to any setup!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great monitor. If you are like me you wanted a 1080p monitor with no compromises and this one had everything I was looking for. It worked perfect out of the box. I have now purchased two of these monitors and the second one works no problem.Pros:27 inchesNo bezelIPSLED Backlit1080pVESA MOUNTING ( no dam monitors have this)60 hzMatte screenCons:Doesn&rsquo;t come with DVI in the back, comes with HDMI and VGA, I have an HDMI to DVI connector hooked up so no problemThe only other con is that I am planning on picking up three of them to do surround gaming and the bottom of the bezel sticks out a tiny bit at the edges and this will make it so there is a hairline gap between multiple monitors, but it&rsquo;s really not that big of a deal.</p>

<p>Easy set up once I figured out how to remove the back to get take the stand completely off. Just a tip, use a credit card to pop off the plastic, works like a charm.</p>
