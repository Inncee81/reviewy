<h5 id="product-is-just-ok-customer-service-leaves-much-to-be-desired">Product is just ok. Customer service leaves much to be desired.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case broke within one day of receipt. The magnet that holds the stand door closed broke <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the way down by simply closing it, with no abuse or misuse. The stand did not close flush into the back of the case and leaves a very noticeable lip from day one. This, combined with the magnet defect, prevents this case from being used further without the stand flying out and making the device awkward to handle and more susceptible to dropping. I attempted to reach out to the company Gumdrop, and they requested pictures of the damage and have not heard back. Customer service isn&rsquo;t great, though I will say that aside from these issues the case is very rugged and will most certainly protect the device. Just hope you do not get a defective unit, as your experience could be similar. I will be shopping around for another case.</p>

<h5 id="bad-product-if-you-have-a-note-with-a-stylus">Bad product if you have a note with a stylus.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a waste of money !!!If you have the Note with stylus you might want to avoid this product.I bought this case cover so I&rsquo;ll have some peace of mind, not fearing that my tablet would fall and break .I put it over the tablet and it looked great , it felt like it would defiantly keep my note pro 12.2 safe .BUT, I started noticing that the screen became less responsive to the touch , AND also the pen started to put out some deformed lines.Around the middle of the screen, strait lines that i draw with the pen became curved , i tried to draw a box and could not get the line strait until i moved the canvas to the side of the screen.After reading what other reviewers said , I guessed this was something to do with the plastic screen protector part of the case.So i removed the plastic cover, the screen became more responsive to the touch as before, BUT!!! it changed nothing for the stylus accuracy.I started putting lines all over my screen and i found out a 1\4inch dead spot around the home button , the pen could not draw in that area , it just carved around it. This curvature was going through to some extent all the way to the middle of the screen , and was the reason for the strait lines becoming curved .I thought that maybe it was something with the home button.IT was Not!The problem was the strong magnet at the back of the case, the same magnet that holds the hide-away stand in place.as soon as i completely removed the cover , things went back to normal , and i could draw strait like once again.I don&rsquo;t know if having a constant magnetic field could permanently harm my wacom digitize in the screen.But since i bought the tablet for art making , it was useless if it lost it&rsquo;s pen accuracy.If you Buy this Cover for the note, and plan to use it with the s-pen, then forget about it !</p>

<h5 id="a-nice-decent-case-if-you-are-on-a-budget-but-the-otterbox-case-is-far-superior-for-protecting-the-tablet-screen">A nice decent case if you are on a budget, but the OtterBox case is far superior for protecting the tablet screen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no complaints about this case. But I did return it to Amazon to exchange it and purchase a similar protective case made by OtterBox, but I did have to pay a lot more money for the OtterBox case, and although both cases from both manufacturers do the job well in protecting the Samsung galaxy note Pro 12.2 inch screen tablet, but the main reason for returning this gumdrop case and going with the OtterBox case instead is that this case does not have any kind of hardcover that you can attach to the front to protect the tablet screen and says that&rsquo;s the most sensitive and easy to damage part of the tablet and since I do a lot of traveling by flight. I wanted a case that included a hardcover to protect the screen and the openings on the gumdrop case that expose the tablet&rsquo;s speakers are not nearly as refined as that on the OtterBox case for they are merely slits that are cut into the rubber to expose the speakers as opposed to the OtterBox case that are very nicely molded and angled outward so that you do not lose any sound quality.</p>

<h5 id="the-case-is-the-best-case-currently-out-for-the-note-12-2">The case is the best case currently out for the Note 12.2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is the best case currently out for the Note 12.2. The best screen protector is the Mime all glass screen protector (US company). My main concern was that the included plastic screen protector would not be easy to remove. I was also worried about the case not fitting over the thicker glass screen protector.Fortunately the plastic cover was easily removed, but the tape holding it on took a little more effort to remove. The case fit over the Mime protector easily. It was more difficult to get the case around the S-pen, but manageable with patience. Overall, the whole process was easy and fit well.My main complaint with the case is that there is not any way to use a 30-40 degree angle for typing without changing the screens orientation. You can keep the orientation, and not fold out the smaller magnetic support flap, but I wonder how long that would work before the hinge breaks.update: The Mime screen protectors extra thickness creates a slight gap between the devices home button and the Gumdrop case button. I used one of those silly &lsquo;aluminum&rsquo; button stickers to fill the gap and its not noticable, and made the home button more responsive&hellip; ymmv.</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-the-best-most-protective-case-available-for-the-note-pro-12-2in">Absolutely the best, most protective case available for the Note Pro 12.2in!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent case! Absolutely love it! Every bit as protective as an otterbox at a fraction of the cost. In fact, it&rsquo;s nicer than an otterbox. It fit my Note Pro 12.2 inch perfectly. I love that all the ports are protected as well. It also has the option to use with or without the screen protector that is included. The only small complaint I would have is the corner where the S-pen is located doesn&rsquo;t seem to stay in place, or is easily removed&hellip;but, other than that, it&rsquo;s really an awesome case. I would definitely buy another one if more colors become available. If you have done your research, you know that cases for this specific tablet are hard to find as it is, let alone one this nice. And with the equivalent of a $120 otterbox, it&rsquo;s well worth the money!</p>

<p>The case provides great protection. For senior citizens, it helps to grip the tablet. I had one for my iPad and got this when my husband got his Galaxy.</p>
