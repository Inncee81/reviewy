<h5 id="i-ve-had-a-few-of-these-this-is-my-favorite">i&rsquo;ve had a few of these, this is my favorite</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as expected.PROS:Not hard to turn on (I&rsquo;ve had a number of these, sometimes you hafta try to click it on multiple times before it acknowledges you. This one doesn&rsquo;t do that)Bendy arm stays put, doesn&rsquo;t flop back like some others. Nice and sturdy.LOVE that it is rechargeable so I can grab it and take it someplace if I need to.Clip is big and sturdy with enough depth to grab onto something.Nice and bright.CONS:The cord is INCREDIBLY short. But since you can use it cordless I decided not to deduct points.OTHER / on the fence:I use this in bed to read when my spouse is sleeping. So I like the dim setting (one click) to be a little dimmer than this one. But that&rsquo;s a personal preference, some might like the light level.Bottom line - this is my 4th or 5th of these kinds of devices, this one is my favorite.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-light-every-reader-should-have-for-night-time-reading">Fantastic light every reader should have for night time reading!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great book light! It is very sturdy and the light is wonderful. I have no problems seeing any part of my book while reading. There are 2 settings on the light: bright and brighter. I have never had to use the second setting for the brighter light because the first light works great! My husband has no problems sleeping next to me while I am using this to read at night. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a really nice book light at a great price! The manufacturer has great customer service as well, they emailed me to make sure everything was good with the light and to make sure I was happy with their product. I love this light I have used it every night since I got it and I still have not had to charge it!! Makes both my husband and I happy he gets to sleep and I get to read more. I used to have to stop reading or go to the living room when he was ready to go to sleep but not anymore! Nothing beats being comfy and reading in bed to me, especially now that it is starting to get cooler out! Again if you love to read in bed at night and have a spouse that can&rsquo;t sleep with a lamp on or reading in the car at night while on a road trip or waiting on someone than this is for you. I have had many book lights in the past and none of them are as well built as this one! The clamp is great and can easily hold large sized books or very small books. I don&rsquo;t think the clamp will wear down anytime soon either. I will be purchasing more of these for Christmas as gifts for family and friends that love to read! Again I have had many book lights in the past and this is by far the best I have ever had!!!!</p>

<h5 id="nice">nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>really nice book light. clip is a bit large and heavy&hellip;especially for thinner paperback, or puzzle books. Still, overall nice and fairly priced. Has two settings and very good illumination. mostly nice for a rechargeable</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good clear steady light. Flexible, adjustable neck. I&rsquo;ve found it works well with both hardbacks and paperbacks. I can read late into the night without the light bothering my wife. The charge lasts hours and hours, then you just recharge. Getting away from batteries was a main reason I purchased this kind of book light. Very affordable I&rsquo;m very satisfied with the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-light">Love this light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this light. I not only use it for reading my books but I also clip it on my computer desk and use it to check my mail or do my nails. It works well so I don&rsquo;t have to turn on a ceiling light and bother others. Easy to use and all you have to do is push the button for a brighter light. Perfect desk light for me and compact. Would recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-a-standard-micro-usb-charging-cable">not a standard micro usb charging cable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The light itself is fine. Two different brightness levels and a handy clip. The major downside is that this is rechargeable using the supplied cord and it is not a standard micro usb. It is a special cable with a round charging plug so you need to be very careful you don&rsquo;t lose it. I would prefer not to need yet another charging cable to keep track of.Edit 2/20/2017:After seeing this review the manufacturer was kind enough to send me a free new model of the charger which is charged by the standard mini usb. It also has some other upgrades. Very nice. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-bedside-reading">Perfect for bedside reading.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I got this light. It&rsquo;s battery lasts a long time between charges. I got it as a bedside reading light for my 5yr old. It&rsquo;s working great and doubles as a night light of she gets scared during the night.My only complaint is that it&rsquo;s not a mini usb. So only the charger it came with works with it. Not a terrible thing but just a mild inconvenience in a time when everything in life needs charging.</p>

<h5 id="the-lighting-in-my-room-is-not-very-good-so-i-bought-this-to-make-my-case">The lighting in my room is not very good, so I bought this to make my case &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a law student and I bought this because I&rsquo;ve been doing some work in my bed as I hurt my back. The lighting in my room is not very good, so I bought this to make my case books easier to read. The light is very bright. It does not spread evenly over my casebooks, but the books are really big so I did not take a star off for this. I think it would be perfect for a normal book. I like that it is rechargeable too. The reason I took a star off is because the clamp is very bulky and does not even work that well. Overall, I really like the product though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-how-well-this-lights-up-my-books-at-night">Love how well this lights up my books at night</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love how well this lights up my books at night, and the fact that you can adjust how bright you want it to be with the 3 different brightness options, great quality and being able&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="junk">Junk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a piece of deal. It stopped working a month after we bought it. It won&rsquo;t charge or turn on at all. So disappointing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-small-personal-light">Excellent Small Personal Light</h5>

<p>My wife bought it to use on an embroidery hoop, but it is just a little large at the clip for that. But there is clearly nothing wrong with the lamp, and we will find many other&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-value-for-the-price">Good value for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my son to use for reading at night, the idea being he could clip it to his headboard.</p>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<p>Ordered it and did not come with a charger.</p>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good light. The clip could be much smaller.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works Fantastic!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-book-light">Great book light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally love this light! It is sturdy but not heavy. The light is perfect for reading in low light or no light (night).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars-1">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to read while my husband sleeps, but he says it&rsquo;s too bright. Sigh. I&rsquo;ll keep looking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-like-that-this-light-is-rechargeable">I really like that this light is rechargeable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like that this light is rechargeable, the clip is sturdy which has been great for my differently sized textbooks. Bonus* it also fits snugly on a standard music stand.</p>
