<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="happy-so-far">Happy so far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only taken our RV out once since I purchased the booster, but the one time we did, it increased the cell signal from 2 or 3 bars to 5 bars inside our trailer. We&rsquo;re definitely happy with our purchase, but the real test will be when there&rsquo;s only 1 bar to start with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice booster that works very well and is easy to set up and works so well. I kept looking at the set up and telling myself that there had to be more to it but there wasn&rsquo;t it was so easy. This booster boosts the download speed and upload speeds substantially. I work while we are camping and this works great with my VPN access and VIOP phones. I called their customer service once and the person went way above and beyond to take care of me and made me feel like a valued customer. The have made me a customer for life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Initially I had mixed feelings about the Weboost and was ready to return it. We decided to call customer support and they are really helpful in guiding us in the proper way to set up and remove interference. Once we had the right set-up we did see an appreciable boost in our signals. We have T-mobile that is notorious for having a bad signal but I love the all inclusive pricing package of Tmobile vs Verizon or ATT. The Weboost has allowed us to keep using Tmoblie as our only hotspot as we fulltime in our RV throughout the country. We have stayed in BLM land, National Parks and sometimes we go from no signals to LTE. The signals have been good enough to watch Netflix. However, if you are too out of reach of a signal it cannot boost anything that does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-perfect-but-it-has-significantly-improved-signal-in-a-marginal-signal-area">Not perfect, but it has significantly improved signal in a marginal signal area</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We replaced a five and a half year old 3G system with this one. Our camp is located in the middle of a national forest with 80- to 100-year-old loblolly pines and various species of oak trees in a county with a small population, so cell signal where we are is lousy for any of the popular carriers. With this signal booster, we usually have decent 3G or sometimes 4G signal. In the past, with the old booster, we obviously didn&rsquo;t get 4G, but often got 1X or no signal at all. This booster hasn&rsquo;t solved the problem completely but it is a good improvement over the older booster.We are using a yagi (directional) antenna on a 40-foot antenna tower to reach a tower seven or eight miles away so our situation is probably very different from that of most people using this booster. We did have to use different cabling/connectors from the antenna to the booster than the older booster used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-ll-need-an-rv-longer-than-30-feet-to-use-it">You&rsquo;ll need an RV longer than 30 feet to use it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried it in a 30 foot class A Motorhome and there was just no way to get enough separation between the inside and outside antennas to prevent oscillation. I was able to get it to work a little by wrapping the inside antenna In aluminum foil with my phone. When I contacted customer support they said that installing it as directed by the instructions was not recommended. In addition, the outside antenna is directional which sounds great but in reality only gives you three directions to aim it. If your rig is facing the tower there is no way to point the antenna at it unless you put the outside antenna in front and the inside antenna (and your phone) in the back.I sent it back and purchased another model from the same manufacturer and it works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="was-hopeful-but-too-inconsistent">Was hopeful, but too inconsistent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wanted this product to work for us but it was far too annoying to get it working. While we knew that we would have to identify the right direction and mount it each trip, we didn&rsquo;t anticipate how difficult it would be to get it working. If we got the right direction, then we would have issues with it not liking how close the inside and outside units were to each other. If we attempted to spread them apart, we would lose the increased reception. Just too much of a pain to worry about. We will consider a permenantly mounted option instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-even-returned-it-and-tried-another-one-thinking-that-i-might-have-been-bad-out-of-the-box">I even returned it and tried another one thinking that I might have been bad out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I only gave this one star because there is not a place to leave 0 stars. I tried hooking this up and even was on the phone with tec support. The two antennas were interfearing with each other and would not work to boost the cell signal. I even returned it and tried another one thinking that I might have been bad out of the box. This was not the case and it still didn&rsquo;t work. I would not spend the money on this product. I honestly don&rsquo;t know how they can sell this crap!</p>

<h5 id="this-the-best-we-are-in-a-place-that-i">this the best.. we are in a place that I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this the best..we are in a place that I used to be getting 1 bar now its 4 bar..always have connections..we live in mountain area where reception so weak..this made my life easier..so very happy about it&hellip;thank you guys..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-purchased-this-with-the-hopes-of-it-providing-a">I purchased this with the hopes of it providing a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this with the hopes of it providing a boost to my RV as I travel across the country for 90 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>a little hard to install not easy to hide in the RV</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install">Easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install, brings you a signal in rural areas, does exactly what it says and the company is great to talk with if you need assistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-i-have-a-couple-of-friends-recommended-the-rv-weboost">and I have a couple of friends recommended the RV Weboost</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all I am a long time RV&rsquo;er and have a 38 ft Motorhome. I had a Wilson 3G Booster in the past, and I have a couple of friends recommended the RV Weboost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-work-for-me-where-i-needed-it-to">Did NOT Work for Me Where I Needed it To</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not work. I ordered this as the reviews were good. I need one is a specific place that I go every year to camp and scuba dive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-really-good-for-rv-sites">Not really good for RV sites</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not really good for RV sites. Vista CA was where we parked for three months and did not really help with signal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-cell-phone-signal-booster">Amazing cell phone signal booster.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are using this in a very remote part of the Mojave Preserve, went from no signal no bars to 4g and full bars. Amazing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the money, I am pretty disappointed. We are in a bad area right now so im hoping the next spot it will be better. Also very intermittent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didn-t-improve-our-signal-and-tech-support-sucked">Didn&rsquo;t improve our signal and tech support sucked.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not worth the hastle. Didn&rsquo;t improve our signal and tech support sucked.</p>
