<h5 id="dnt-buy">DNT BUY!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At 1st I was in love with this item. Worked well and loved the look. I also purchased the warranty considering it wasn&rsquo;t expensive and I wanted to make sure it would last.I wasn&rsquo;t having the problems everyone else was so that made me even happier. It did arrive rather quickly so that was a plus, however around a month in a half the mouse started acting up. Never had the problem of it falling asleep while I was working, but when I would try to scroll up or down, it would make my page jump up and down in a real fast motion. I tried going through the &ldquo;warranty&rdquo; I had purchased thinking it was going to be as smooth as it said it would&hellip;. well they came back saying it was still covered under the original manufacture warranty. Still no problem there except there is no name brand on the box or on the item.I contacted Amazon and with their great customer service they offered to contact the seller for me to obtain the manufacture name, but they never contacted me nor Amazon back! I was very disappointed in the fact I was in love with this item and now I can not use it nor can I use the warranty I purchased for it&hellip;Apparently all this is bogus so please dnt get the warranty, it&rsquo;s no use and ya the item won&rsquo;t last you much. I was hoping to be lucky and just receive a good one that I would enjoy, mind you this was for work not for home&hellip; Amazon did take care of me, but as for the seller, they never tried to assist or help me with this matter which is so upsetting because now I had to go buy another mouse and of coarse take up another USB port which I was already using&hellip; DONT BUY!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this set. Works great and was super easy to set up. Idk why some say the key noise is loud? It&rsquo;s def audible but I&rsquo;m so focused on my work I hardly notice. The mouse is not even audible when clicking! I thought the small keyboard what bother me typing but for what I do it&rsquo;s fine. I would love to see this offered in a standard sized keyboard though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective-items-do-not-order-and-non-responsive-seller-item-doesn-t-last-more-than-6-months">DEFECTIVE ITEMS - DO NOT ORDER&hellip;AND NON RESPONSIVE SELLER!!! ITEM DOESN&rsquo;T LAST MORE THAN 6 MONTHS!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO RESPONSE FROM SELLER WHEN I TRIED CONTACTING THEM AS MY MOUSE SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING FOR NO REASON WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT. BE AWARE! I PURCHASED ANOTHER ITEM AND THAT ONE DIDN&rsquo;T WORK EITHER AND I HAD TO RETURN IT. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE ITEM.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-keyboard-but-beware-of-potential-duds">A good keyboard- but beware of potential duds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: The Seller was kind enough to send me another free of charge after both the mouse and keyboard failed to function in less than a week. It seems that the first one I got was defective- so take that into account. The working one is great, two weeks or so now, and has pretty good wireless range too! I would avoid spraying it with any water, and use a very damped cloth as the previous one was very sensitive to water getting between the keys.The mouse is great, nice and quiet. The color of both is fantastic and the keyboard is super light and small to move around. I hope it lasts, as I really like it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-very-good-quality-but-working">Not very good quality but working&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it mainly for matching color of my slim computer box. They are cheaply made but function okay as keyboard and mouse, Mouse itself is likely made from even cheaper plastic so I don&rsquo;t know how long it could last. Once I thought mouse died after one month occasional usage but it seemed to be some flaw of power saving / on / off issue related to wireless receiver. I just re-plugged receiver and mouse came live again. Keyboard didn&rsquo;t have the similar issue so I am not entirely sure what the real problem is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-but">Cute but&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this one time since I got it for Christmas. I&rsquo;ve changed the batteries plenty of times and the keyboard isn&rsquo;t working. The mouse works after a few minutes of playing with it but the keyboard won&rsquo;t type</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-golden">Work Golden</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this set for work after I dropped and killed my old mouse. The keyboard is petite but that works just fine for me and the gold is great (really more of a champagne).Note: the keyboard doesn&rsquo;t contain the End, Home or Print Screen buttons, which I realize now that I DON&rsquo;T have them, I use all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didn-t-work-out-of-the-box">Didn&rsquo;t work out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not work out of the box. The instructions to connect were not very clear either. Fail on all levels.Pity since the size and design seemed to be nice.Cheap Chinese crap manufacturing, if you don&rsquo;t mind the risk of having to return a few before getting one that works, go elsewhere</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>was okay while it lasted&hellip;.not even a month and it would not work</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mouse-doesn-t-work">Mouse doesn&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Keyboard works and both are visually attractive. However mouse didn&rsquo;t work straight out of package. Also the box looked like it had been opened and items were poorly secured in&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the mouse especially since it doesn&rsquo;t make a click noise but the keyboard is a little small for me, hard to get used to but compact and thin and easy to travel with</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m have trouble with only one key &ldquo;S&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know what to do! :/</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-2">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks great but stopped working after 30 minutes. I returned it and got the a different model keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stay-away">Stay Away</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Trash, waste of my time.It&rsquo;Is not even recognized by my MacBook air..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this! I have the Microsoft surface pro 4 and it works perfectly with it, even the mouse connected fine . Have no problems with it at all .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>looks pretty but you can feel that it is made of very cheap plastic</p>
