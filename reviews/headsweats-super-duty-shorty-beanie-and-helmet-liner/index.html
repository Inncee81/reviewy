<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product-but-a-tad-small">Great product, but a tad small.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for long distance running. It works great at keeping the sweat out of my eyes. My only gripe is that it runs a bit small. I have a shaved head with no hair to get in the way. And I wear a 7-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch cap. i can feel the pressure build up more and more, mile after mile. After ten or so miles I get home and take it off. It literally takes about two hours for the line to disappear from my forehead.I really want to give this product five stars but I had to stop wearing it due to the small size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-but-variable-sizing">Great quality, but variable sizing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been wearing these things for years - like 20 years - including this brand, which is one of my favorites. I have noticed that the size varies - sometimes it is a bit tight, sometimes right on, and one time it was really loose, but I think that one was meant to go over the tops of the ears, maybe. I have a small head, around 56cm/22in, so if you have a bigger head these might feel tight, but this recent one is one of the looser more comfy ones I have received. I do get a line on my forehead after wearing them, which lasts for about an hour, maybe, tops. I get this with all of them, pretty much, except the real loose ones. The problem of snugness seems to be pretty universal with these nylon skull caps - and I have probably 5 or 6 different brands, at least, that I have tried (many of those offered on Amazon). The Shorty has a terrycloth patch on the band over the forehead, which is quite comfy, and may offer some improved sweat blocking, but to be honest, the ones I have that lack this seem to work fine for me, including on long sweaty runs in heat and humidity. Btw, I use these all the time for all sorts of things - running, biking (under a helmet), marshall arts training, at the gym, and just walking/riding around town with the family. I took one star off, not for quality, but because the sizing varies more then it should - but this is over many years, several purchases, from, probably, various sellers.</p>

<h5 id="best-sweat-band-ever">Best sweat band ever!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best sweat type band that I have ever had &amp; I have been cycling since 1984! I though my Gutr was good but when my helmet sponges got loaded up with sweat in front the sweat would miss the Gutr &amp; hit my glasses, but with the Headsweats Beanie the sweat stays in the beanie &amp; wicks toward the tail in the back &amp; I never get sweat on my glasses any more. I just used this on a 54 mile ride last Saturday in So Cal where it got up to 94&rsquo;, yes 94&rsquo; on March 14, 2015 &amp; not one drop of sweat got on my glasses or in my eyes. I just ordered two more one extra for myself &amp; one as a gift for my cycling friend. The sweat band within the beanie is 1&rdquo; wide all the way around to the tail in the back that helps pull the mouisture to the rear. This weekend I am going to try it under my snow ski helmet at Mammoth because of the warm spring like conditions.</p>

<h5 id="another-great-headsweats-product">Another Great Headsweats Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Headsweats for 12 years.I first used it when riding my bicycle across the USA in 2000. I had two problems that I was trying to address:- I was getting sunburned through the holes in my bike helmet, and- I was getting tired of having sweat drip into my eyesA web search found the Headsweats folks. I called up the owner in Cincinnati and his product seemed like exactly what I needed. I immediately ordered three of them and had them shipped to me mid-tour. I was absolutely delighted by the performance of these things. Ever since, I&rsquo;ve had no problem whatsoever with either of the above issues.The Cool-Max sweatband built into the thing is quite effective in absorbing sweat.While I originally used the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; version, I&rsquo;ve since upgraded to the &ldquo;shorty&rdquo; version. The classic version sort of had an open back with three floppy pieces that were intended to be tied at the back of your head. That felt uncomfortable inside my helmet &ndash; so I never tied them. The problem with the classic version was that when you take the helmet off, the untied floppy things would flop around in the wind &ndash; sometimes flopping over my head and onto my face &ndash; awkward. The shorty version fixes that drawback, while keeping the same high performance of the original.I LOVE my Headsweats!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="older-versions-fantastic-new-one-not-so-much">Older versions fantastic. New one not so much.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest edition of this previous great product is sad. The current version is the same as the older one except it is now &ldquo;Super Duty&rdquo; which means it is thicker in all areas including the sweat band portion of the cap which means double stitching for the band itself so there is stitching on the top and bottom of the band. Now take that situation combined with the new beanie being smaller and it fits too tight on my medium size head around the forehead and side. Consequently when I take off the cap after a ride there is a circular groove in my skin that goes around my head so it looks for hours afterward like I have a scar from having the top of my skull removed. Ridiculous. I&rsquo;ve lessen the problem by using scissors to make vertical cuts in the sweatband to lessen the tension.Why they changed to this newer version is a mystery to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-more-sweat-in-the-eyes">No more sweat in the eyes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally I found the product that keeps the sweat out of my eyes while running and cycling.I have tried many skull caps and headbands with sweat still pouring into my eyes stinging them but the first time I tried the Headsweats beanie I was sweat free.i finished a 6 mile run the other day and no sweat in my eyes.In fact I love this beanie so much I ordered another one right away.Great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-had-an-older-headsweat-beanie-that-i-loved-i-ordered-this-one-and-it-doesnt-have">I had an older headsweat beanie that I loved. I ordered this one and it doesnt have &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had an older headsweat beanie that I loved. I ordered this one and it doesnt have the terry cloth piece across the forehead. With that said it doesn&rsquo;t hold in the sweat very good. In fact the bottom edge in front leaves a crease in my forehead. It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable to wear for any extended length of time. Personally I think it is a cheap imitation of headsweat brand and not the real thing. I cannot recommend this for anyone to buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-even-on-larger-heads">works great, even on larger heads</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cap does a great job of keeping the sweat out of my eyes on long hot bike rides. It easily fits under my helmet. I have a larger head (hat size 7.5) and many of the other brands are too tight. This one fits me comfortably.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-as-expected-appears-to-be-good-quality">Fits as expected, appears to be good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits as expected, will work under my helmet, if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-the-look-and-feel-of-the-material-but-it">I like the look and feel of the material but it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the look and feel of the material but it is just too tight on my head. And the ties in the back are shorter than I expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits good and drains sweat away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These headsweats are perfect for cycling and made well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfect">Works perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works prefect. Keeps sweat out of my eyes during intense workouts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-these-things-for-controlling-the-sweat-that-comes-off">I love these things for controlling the sweat that comes off &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these things for controlling the sweat that comes off from my head. As I am a bald guy. Nothing to catch the sweat, and these protect my head from excess sun as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-more-sweat-in-my-eyes">No more sweat in my eyes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I sweat a lot and hate having to stop my bike ride because the sweat is burning my eyes. I have tried just about every brand of head band and this is by far the best product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-expected">Just what I expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I expected</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keeps-the-sweat-out-of-my-eyes">keeps the sweat out of my eyes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think my hat size is 7 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. Maybe on the large side as heads go, but not unusually so. In any case, this do rag is a bit tight on me. But it&rsquo;s still better than sweat in my eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-just-ridding-around-time-great-for-long-trips-not-so-much">but just ridding around time great for long trips not so much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>fit as epected but the longer you wear them it seems to tighten up and causes some discomfort. but just ridding around time great for long trips not so much.</p>
