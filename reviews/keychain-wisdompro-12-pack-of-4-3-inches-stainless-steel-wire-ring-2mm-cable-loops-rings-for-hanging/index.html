<h5 id="nice-easy-good-cosmetic-not-sure-about-the-durability">Nice, easy, good cosmetic&hellip; Not sure about the durability.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these as a multi-purpose tool and to replace traditional keyrings. The one with my daily keys has been solid but the one that my wife used for her daily keys came apart after a couple of days. Great for the price but I had to knock off one star for the one that broke quickly with light use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-people-with-arthritic-hands-the-shorter-ones-at-least">Not for people with arthritic hands&hellip;the shorter ones at least.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice quality and a great price. I would recommend getting the six inch length. I purchased the 4 inch size and found that some of these are less flexible than others, particularly the blue, purple, and black colored items. The shorter length makes it a bit more difficult to make the ends meet on the darker colored rings, though I have no idea why the color of the vinyl covering the cable would effect the flexibility. I did put in an order for the six inch set and am certain I&rsquo;ll love them. Hoping the stiffer ones will become more flexible with handling. Save those for projects you won&rsquo;t have to add more items to frequently. The clear and light green colored cables were easily connected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-sized-sturdy-great-for-tiles">Perfect sized, sturdy, great for Tiles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sturdy keyring, easy to secure without marring my fingernails. Excellent for my Tiles!I needed to buy some Tiles because I got tired of losing my keys and wallet. These cable loops popped up in the &ldquo;Customers who bought this item also bought&rdquo; section. Thank you previous buyers, and thank you to the algorithm writers who made this possible. These wee cables are perfect, and I am really happy to have 12 of these little cables.When the loop is laid out straight, the 4.3&rdquo; length is just under four and a half inches&hellip;so true to advertised size. Closing the loop is easy, the threaded connector perfectly fits the threads, and the closure is secure. If you&rsquo;re having a hard time closing the loop (tightening the connector until it cannot tighten further), press the loop into an oval - this helps the threads align with the connector. When the loop is closed it is larger than the typical keyring, the extra room is useful without being too large.I love these loops for my Tiles. One loop carries my keys, another is on my wallet, and my third loop is inside my carryon luggage. Each loop is secure, and I like the color options. I&rsquo;m going to replace all of my standard key rings with the remaining loops (since I have only used three in my set of 12). I am very happy with these cable loops, and I look forward to finding more practical uses for these beyond the usual key rings.(Photos coming soon!)</p>

<h5 id="good-for-stay-put-compact-connection">Good For Stay Put Compact Connection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Might prefer the next size up for easy of use. This is a little stiff to bend and connect so if keys were on it I would be worried they could fly in the air when undoing it. One of them didn&rsquo;t connect at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-hate-the-old-type-of-key-rings-that-you-break">I hate the old type of key rings that you break &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I know key chains are not the biggest thing to get excited about, but I was really excited when I got these. I hate the old type of key rings that you break your nails prying them open and then trying to slide the keys on and off. This is so much easier it&rsquo;s almost like a bracelet for your keys. You just slide your keys through the end and use them jewelry Style screw on clasp to make the circle complete. I have 2 looped together right now and had no issues with them coming loose. I will never go back to the old metal keyring again. Another plus these are coated so less noise if you ha e multiple keys. Try these, you will never go back to traditional keyrings, I promise you that!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-perfect-for-my-needs">These are perfect for my needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EXACTLY what I was looking for! I do a lot of cross-stitch projects and I use plastic bobbins to hold the floss colors for each individual piece so I can bag it and take it with me when I have appointments (it beats reading magazines in offices). I needed something on which to put the bobbins that isn&rsquo;t permanent - I was using twist ties but they are too flimsy. These are perfect for my needs. They hold the bobbins, yet I can undo them when I&rsquo;m finished and return the floss to my storage cases. I can&rsquo;t attest to the durability, since this use is not exactly heavy-duty; however, they are exactly what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="first-use-failure">First use failure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of them failed, that is, the ends pulled off the very first time they were fastened. It does not give much confidence in the ones that did hold together long enough to be fastened. I certainly would not use them on anything where failure could result in the loss of what they were holding and I would not recommend them. For a far superior product, both in design and quality, check out the Lucky Line Flex-o-lock.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-faulty">Great but faulty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great alternatives for key rings. However! After a while, each wire ring does unscrew without you realizing it. I usually just tighten it once and a while and make sure no keys are lost!Also, out of the 12 wire rings, there were at least two that were damaged. I tugged on it to see how durable it is and how strong it can hold, the ends snapped and was no longer usable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adjustable-key-chains">adjustable key chains</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although my use as different from that which was intended I can heartily endorse this product and the capable vendor</p>

<h5 id="fortunately-it-happened-prior-to-travelling">fortunately it happened prior to travelling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these to replace previous cords that did not have the plastic coating. I use them to hold luggage tags and the metal strands began to fray which can be a poking hazard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Could be a little longer. No problems noted.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>
