<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-deer-watching">Great for deer watching</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought these to enjoy watching deer on our farm. They are just right for this at distances up to about 900 yards. Much better at light gathering than the 8x28 units we have used in the past. Focusing is easy and fast and they are light enough to use for extended periods of time.*** UPDATE - 3/9/2017 *** I took a photo today by simply placing my cell phone lens over one of the eyepieces. I verified the range to the road sign using GPS at 8,472 ft (1.6 miles) - (2,824 yards) The view is actually razor sharp, but the autofocus on the phone camera blurs it a bit. I am very happy with the Bushnell Powerview 20x50.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-every-penny">Worth every penny</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was going back and forth on these or a pair of Nikon (any pair or Nikon&rsquo;s, really). It was my understanding that these here Bushnell would be less than stellar compared to an expensive brand.Not true. These Bushnell 20x50 are awesome! They are super crisp, and believe it or not, they are actually really easy to hold steady considering the magnification. They have slightly more weight than, say, a small compact pair of bino&rsquo;s, but these are great. Worth every penny.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow-these-are-powerful">Wow, these are powerful!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When you first get them, make sure to clean off the lenses REALLY well or you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. It took a while to get them adjusted right and cleaned, but now that it&rsquo;s done, these work very well. As with any higher powered binocular, every little move your hands make will cause your view to be very shaky. You&rsquo;ll either need a very steady hand or you&rsquo;ll want to set them on a pedestal and look through them.I&rsquo;d recommend them if you are wanting to look at stuff 5-15 miles away. If the object is only 1-5 miles away and stationary, you&rsquo;ll get a great view. If it&rsquo;s moving, forget it. Go with a less powerful pair.These are also heavy to hold steady after a while.</p>

<h5 id="lens-not-sealed-faulty-gasket">Lens Not Sealed. Faulty Gasket!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these and they arrived in only 2 days. I tried them out seemed to work okay. But the bottom ( Larger) Lens looked scratched up. Upon further inspection. I noticed they looked scratched or fogged from INSIDE the lens of both barrels.I tried breathing on the lens like you do on a pair of eye glasses and wiping it with the provided cloth. But this did not help. The seal or gasket may be faulty allowing the lens to fog up from the inside. Will be returning this pair for a replacement or refund. (Note) Would not recommend the cleaning cloth that comes with it, alot of lint on it. Buy a good quality lint free cloth from the camera department at your local Department Store.</p>

<h5 id="review-of-bushnell-model-131056-10x50-powerview-bincocular">Review of Bushnell model 131056 10x50 PowerView bincocular</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not much to dislike at all about these. I have found the Bushnell (model 131056) PowerView 10x50 porro-prism wide angle binoculars to be of excellent quality, and an outstanding value for the price: I bought mine for $48.72, including shipping and tax, through Amazon.com.What I liked:- Multi coated optics and Bk7 prisms (borosilicate crown glass) result in a very clear, sharp image. The large 50mm objectives gather light well even in low-light level conditions. I have used them for moon- and star-gazing, birdwatching and general outdoor use. In all circumstances they have performed exceptionally well.- Image quality. In my opinion, image quality is as good as what I remember with the Steiner binos I was issued when deployed to Anbar Province and Baghdad, Iraq on a US Army Military Transition Team (MiTT) mission in 2006-2007 - if I recall correctly, they were a Steiner 7x50 porro-prism bino with a mil-scale reticle - what the Army refers to as an M22 bino. The civilian version of these Steiners sells for $800.00+. The Bushnells also compare favorably with some of the expensive Nikon, Zeiss, Zeiss/Jena, Leica and Hensoldt/Wetzlar binos I have had the opportunity to use during a 24-year career in the US Army. However, I do NOT believe that, for most use, the relatively marginal increase in image quality in those far more expensive binos justifies paying 10 to 20 times the cost of these Bushnells.- Toggle lever focus system. Bushnell calls it &ldquo;InstaFocus&rdquo;, works well, I have found it precise enough for small focus adjustments once I got used to it. Particulary useful for tracking/identifying moving objects such as ground vehicles, aircraft in flight and personnel moving across terrain at varying distances. I have also found it works exceptionally well for tracking moving animals in the field and birds moving through trees and in flight.- Rubber armor. Covers the entire body of these binoculars - makes them easy to grip even when wet and should serve well to protect the internal optics from damage if they see some rough use.- Wide woven neck strap. Works well for my use, does not dig into neck/shoulders during field carry. For those wanting increased comfort and utility, buy an upgraded strap or even a bino harness system.- Padded nylon case. Suitable for average use, same as what came with some far more expensive Nikons I bought recently. For more protection, recommend buying a case that is more water/humidity/dust resistant, better padded and shuts more completely with a zipper. Most of these, such as the FieldLine tm brand models are reasonably priced and often come with additional internal and external storage pockets.Other notes:- I have noticed some minor color fidelity issues (called chromatic aberration) under some conditions, as well as slight image distortion/bluriness at the edges of the field of view. Be aware that this is an inherent problem with any optics. Routing light through any lens system will cause this, thus it also occurs in more expensive binoculars to varying degrees. It is not an indication of any manufacturing or design flaw. Everything in the center of the field of view is in color-correct crisp focus with no distortion, so I do not find these issues objectionable given the relatively large field of view of 341 feet @ 1000 yards.- Lens covers. The ones that come with binos work well to protect lenses, fit tightly. Problem is they are not attached to bino body, so one could conceivably lose them. I bought lens covers that stay attached to bino - available at Amazon and at most optics stores and online optics vendors.- Close focus distance is 20 feet. You cannot bring anything into focus that is closer than this. Note that this not a flaw or malfunction, this is just how Bushnell designed the optics on these particular binoculars. I personally have not found this to cause any problems as I seldom have had the need to look at anything that is closer than 20 feet.- 5mm exit pupil. Makes prolonged use of this bino easy on the eyes.- 26 oz weight. Among the lightest 10x50 binos you will find (Our family-use Nikon 8x40 binos weigh more than these, and they are smaller.) Light enough to be easy to carry for prolonged periods of time. While hiking, walking: if I&rsquo;m not planning on using them soon, I keep them in my bino case on my belt or slung over my shoulder until I need them; I find this makes it easier to carry them.- Fold down eyecups and 10mm eye relief allow those who wear glasses to use these easily. I wear glasses but I personally find it easier to remove my glasses before using binos, so I leave the eyecups up.- Right side adjustable diopter. Makes it easy to adjust to your individual eyesight requirements.- Even though these binos are not waterproof or fogproof (ie: not O-ring sealed and dry-nitrogen purged) I have not experienced any internal fogging in the rain, warm humid conditions or in situations when they went from warm to cold temperatures. If you want a waterproof and fog-proof binocular, highly recommend the Bushnell Legacy series porro-prism binoculars. They also have the more newly developed BaK4 (Barium Crown Glass) prisms, can focus closer (18 ft for the 10x50 model) and come in three models: 8x42, 10x50, and 10-22x50 Zoom. You can find them for around $100.00 +/- at Amazon. Bushnell also has many other porro-prism and roof-prism binos in a wide price range to suit your needs.</p>

<h5 id="worst-pair-of-bino-s-i-have-ever-owned">Worst pair of bino&rsquo;s I have ever owned.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned do own a lot of binos. These are just plain old poor quality. The lenses never focus right even with adjustments as per instructions. The focus-er (sp?) is so sensitive that it literally moves by itself. The distance between the eyepieces is to narrow and will not adjust out far enough. The best way I found to use them is to close one eye because even after adjustment things are still blurry. I own the previous model of these and I grab them instead because these are dookie. Would not buy again or recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-binoculars-excellent-customer-service">Great binoculars, excellent customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great binoculars, easy to focus, and rocker focus for up close and distant works flawlessly. These are 12 power and are about as powerful as a person can hold steady without going to a tripod. The thing I have liked most about Bushnell is that they stand behind their products. I did have a problem with one pair having to do with the rocker function. I had owned them for about six months, and when I called them, there was just no discussion, they were rigth on top of it. They sent me a new pair withing days. I have contacted customer service twice, and both times the people were most helpful and courteous. They resolved my problems immediately. I like these products so much and the service I received that I have bought them for gifts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="horrible">Horrible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They suck. Constantly fog up, god forbid I taken them from inside to outside they&rsquo;d be dripping in fog on the lenses, god forbid you set themOn the counter they would be&hellip;</p>
