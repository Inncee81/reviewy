<h5 id="great-for-learning-about-astronomy">Great for learning about astronomy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son&rsquo;s tenth birthday was around the corner and with most kids lack of interest in anything that doesn&rsquo;t have a screen nowadays,the wife and I were trying to figure something out that would be educational and possibly something the whole family could enjoy. Looking outside one evening at the sky, it hit me, a telescope! I had one 30 years prior, so I had an idea of what to look for.After a few days of light research, the Orion StarBlast seemed to be a good telescope to go with. I was leaning towards a refractor telescope initially, but this Orion was about $100 more than the one I was looking at. It came in a giant box, we wrapped it up, and my son was genuinely surprised and excited when he opened the gift.Nothing much to assemble. Only tough part was lining up the sight but the little red dot made it fairly easy.After sitting through Sunday&rsquo;s super blood moon lunar eclipse for 3 hours, I realized that even after the kids leave for college, I&rsquo;ll be able to personally enjoy this for years to come. They loved watching the eclipse as did my wife and had loads of questions. The two lenses that come with it are excellent. I do plan to order the recommended Barlow lens in the future though. Looking forward to looking at planets now.I was able to line up my lens with my iPhone for some pics. Took some work but it was fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-beginner-scope">Great Beginner Scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome first scope. Didn&rsquo;t take long for me to get the hang of it. You learn as you go. I purchased filters and extra lenses including a 2x Barlow. So far I&rsquo;ve been able to see stunning close ups of the moon, a small but undeniable Saturn during it&rsquo;s opposition, Jupiter and a few of it&rsquo;s moons and way more stars than I can see with my own eye&rsquo;s (even with an airport only a few miles away) I noticed a couple of confused reviews so I&rsquo;ll tell you, for planetary viewing I use my 2x Barlow with my 20mm lense to locate the planet and then switch to my 6mm lense for more magnification. This is my first scope and I&rsquo;ve only used it a month but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found useful. If your patient and put in the time needed, you won&rsquo;t regret it. If your not patient then don&rsquo;t buy a telescope. I did tons of research before I decided on this scope and this one seemed like the best option, in this price range. It&rsquo;s already paid for itself with my pure enjoyment. It has taken a hungry interest and turned it into a life long passion. I just ordered a 4 mm lense and am already dreaming of my next scope purchase in the coming years. Even then, this one is so convenient and easy to use that I&rsquo;ll still be taking it outside for as long as it let&rsquo;s me. I love it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-my-first-scope-and-i-am-very-happy-with-it">This is my first scope and I am very happy with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first scope and I am very happy with it. Very compact and lightweight, easy to move around and to set up. Optics are good for such entry level equipment. Beware, this is not for observing planets, even with the 2X barlow. The moon however looks great. Observed at 150x with the included eyepiece (6mm) and 2x barlow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-starter-scope">Great starter scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband bought this for himself hint the name on the account. He loves looking at the star&rsquo;s and watches any show on TV he can. But his main reason for getting this was our youngest daughter. She loves the sky too, our oldest looked into it to and said it was amazing. She was excited to be able to see the craters in the moon. With this scope you can do that and so much more. My husband now wants an even bigger one 😬</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I became inserted in digiscoping and tried 3 different spotting scopes priced under $400.00 and was not quite satisfied, I wanted to be able to photograph birds at 100 yards away and be able to identify , none of the scopes I tried were capable, so after careful consideration I bought the Orion 10015 and it did the job with the supplied 6mm eyepiece I have it set up on my back porch aimed at large tree over a football field away with some dead limbs in the top and I have photographed birds such as Bluebird, Crows and Hawks with clarity, it is not a $10,000.00 camera lenses but close I am able to identify small birds. I do not know how they can manufacture a telescope of this quality for under $200.00.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-experience">Excellent experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An excellent out of the box experience. Only assembly required is getting the packaging material off the telescope tube, and attaching the red dot sight. The secondary mirror is collimated quite well, and the primary mirror needed just a touch of tweaking to align it. The alignment ring already placed on the main mirror was very helpful for this.With the included lenses, I am able to view Saturn fairly well as a tiny disc and make out the rings around it (though not distinguish between individual rings). Eye capability does vary from person to person.This telescope was recommended to me as an excellent choice to get started in astronomy on a budget, and I second that recommendation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-magnification-and-clarity-for-the-price-point">Great magnification and clarity for the price point</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great scope for the price point, probably best in class? I&rsquo;m no expert though, so take that with a grain of salt. The only thing this is missing is a tightening/locking mechanism for the X-axis (lateral spinning). You can lock it vertically but you cannot lock it horizontally so it&rsquo;s not something you can &ldquo;bump&rdquo; when viewing - have to be very still and not touch the scope with any part of your body.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-view-first-time-astronomer">Awesome view - First time &ldquo;Astronomer&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was able to clearly see the moon&rsquo;s craters and surface, even as a sliver in the sky. Saw Jupiter and 3 moons. Was able to clearly see the bands on my first time ever using a telescope. No setup out of the box other than configuring the star finder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-expected">Better than expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my wife and is her first telescope so I don&rsquo;t have a lot to compare it to but it&rsquo;s very portable and easy to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Magnification is not that great even tryed different eye pieces</p>

<p>What a great little telescope. Easy to set up and great visualization for the price.</p>

<h5 id="magnification-is-great">magnification is great..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wife got this for my birthday. Set up was ridiculously simple, magnification is great&hellip; as a beginner, the EZ finder makes locating and positioning a breeze.</p>

<p>As a novice star gazer, this telescope has made it rather easy to find constellations with the view finder and was easy to set up.</p>

<p>This is a nice telescope but I was expecting to see things a little more magnified I guess.</p>

<p>So far, so good, but I need to find a way to attach it to my camera tripod to elevate it for comfort&rsquo;s sake.</p>
