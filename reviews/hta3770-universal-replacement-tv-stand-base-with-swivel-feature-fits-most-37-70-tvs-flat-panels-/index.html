<h5 id="fantastic-stand-easy-to-assemble">Fantastic stand, easy to assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really dreading putting this together as we have always used the stands that come with the TV. We just purchased a 65&rdquo; Vizio M series and the included feet are too wide for our entertainment center. Also the display was too low for our soundbar to sit in front of it. This stand solved both problems. It was super easy to put together by myself. The directions are diagrams only sort of like IKEA if you have ever put their furniture together. All of the parts are very clearly labeled and all of the tools needed are included. The base is very good looking and swivels easily. The TV does not tilt forward as others have mentioned, even on the highest setting, and I had no issues getting it level. I didn&rsquo;t even check to make sure it was level until it was completely assembled. I&rsquo;m not sure if put together correctly how it wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-value-very-easy-to-assemble-except-wrong-bolt-size">Excellent value, very easy to assemble except wrong bolt size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall this product is excellent &hellip; it looks nice, is sturdy and is well priced compared to other options. Unless you can find something significantly cheaper, I would not try to save $5 or $10 on an alternative. I would concur with everything said by Ray Diggins in his review on 9/9/2016. A few things to add:* I too could not use the included bolts to attach my TV to the stand. They only provide two sizes of bolts and if you have purchased wall mounts or other similar products, they sometimes include a dozen different sizes. Be prepared to go to the hardware store and work your way through finding a bolt that fits unless you happen to have them already. Do take note that they include square washers which I found to be essential for holding the bolts to the frame &ndash; the holes on the frame are bigger than any bolt head I could find so this was a vital piece the manufacturer included* The base of the stand is made of tempered glass. I had expected plastic so this was a minor surprise. It&rsquo;s attractive so its not a bad surprise. The post from the base to the frame is made of plastic.* Despite the bolt problem, I give them a solid five stars because they had possibly the easiest to follow instructions I&rsquo;ve ever seen for this type of assembly. I&rsquo;ve attached a picture but kudos to the manufacturer for actually labelling all of the parts instead of forcing you to guess which one is which. This saved a ton of time.* The only confusing part of the instructions is there are two rounded triangular brackets that attach to the upper pole to hold the frame. The angle they show on the instructions makes it easy to misunderstand where they go. Also, be sure to note the direction the base is pointed in the instructions to be sure you put those triangular brackets facing the right way (they face towards the front of the stand).I am very pleased with this purchase. For reference, I use this with a 42&rdquo; Phillips LCD TV 4000 series. Many other reviews report using this successfully with much larger TVs and I can see why.</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-stand">Sturdy stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this stand to hold my 65 inch Samsung KS8000, so far so good. Stand looks great and is sturdy. Easy to follow instructions for asseembly. Only complaint is I had to buy longer screws to fasten my tv to the stand. The screws that came with the stand were not long enough. I like the fact that it swivels, a nice feature to have when watching LED tvs and their limited viewing angle.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<p>As advertised, thank you</p>

<h5 id="70-inch-televisions-are-extremely-heavy-and-it-seems-like-this-product-was-not-made-for-those-sizes-despite">70 inch televisions are extremely heavy and it seems like this product was not made for those sizes despite &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an 70 in Vizio television. The TV obviously fits but the stand is not powerful enough to keep the television up. The stand makes the television move forward as if its leaning forward. The item was properly installed the correct way but it seems that the product is way too weak for 70 inch televisions. 70 inch televisions are extremely heavy and it seems like this product was not made for those sizes despite what the product says.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-solid-tv-stand">Very solid TV stand.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This purchase was for a 55&rdquo; LG tv that only had the feet on each end which was way too far apart for the current TV stand. This Tv was on a piece of plywood on top of the tv stand with a towel underneath the plywood as to not scratch the tv stand cherry wood. The plywood extended to compensate the newer larger 55&rdquo;tv . I read thru the 1 page double sided DIAGRAMS and took my time double checking everything. I assembled it in under 30 mins. I used the box it came to on he carpet to assemble &amp; to spin it easily as I work from section to section. Once i was done with the initial stand I had to make sure I attached the brackets to the back of the tv. There was only one choice as to where to put the bracket. Once the main brackets were done i prepared the little brace partially screwed in, I put them to each side of the entertainment center within reach. I stood behind the tv with it all unplugged and lifted teh tv up and set it on the top notch. I did this ALONE and Im only 5&rsquo;2&rdquo;. I would say that is the only time having someone else to help you decide which section on the bracket you&rsquo;d like your tv on. ONce i had the tv on the stand and secured on I lifted the tv from the tv frame and pushed the plywood and towel out slowly by moving it with my hand that was on the lower part of the tv base. If i had kids/pets I would get the straps to secure it but at this time i dont feel it&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<h5 id="totally-capable-at-65-inches">Totally capable at 65 inches</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>mounted my 65 inch Vizio without a problem. Looks sharp and love the idea that such a large TV can now swivel a bit to accommodate viewers and occasional glare. Great clearance from bottom of TV to platform it is on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-swivel-is-also-an-excellent-feature">The swivel is also an excellent feature.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As TV&rsquo;s get larger and larger, the manufacturers increasingly try to save money by designing cheaper stands for their products. The wide stance of some of the Vizio TV&rsquo;s also make the TV nearly impossible to position unless the surface it will be placed upon is nearly 60 inches long. This stand solves that problem. This stand is currently supporting a 70 inch screen with no problems. The swivel is also an excellent feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-job-stand">Nice Job Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got a 60 inch Sony and stand holds tv firm to and sturdy put together in 45 minutes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terrible product. Followed instructions to a T for a Samsung 70&rdquo; TV. after about 2 hours on the stand the metal bent and the tv fell to the side.</p>

<p>Great! Easy to install</p>

<h5 id="product-not-sturdy-under-the-weight-of-a-large-tv">Product not sturdy under the weight of a large TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product might be fine for a very small TV, but it did not feel sturdy at all. My 65&rdquo; TV is only 35 pounds or so, and I did not trust this product to hold it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works really well but it heavy so be prepared.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-ro">I like ro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a good alternative to wall mount.</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I needed. Solid and easy to put together. Stable and works perfectly with my 51 inch Samsung TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-anyone-care">Does anyone care</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stand would have a much higher rating if the screws that were included to mount the tv to the stand were the correct screws!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-we-made-it-work-and-it-is-good-quality">But we made it work and it is good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had to make a manual adjustment to make it fit my tv. But we made it work and it is good quality</p>
