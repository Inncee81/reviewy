<blockquote>
<p>I have a D610 camera with sevral lenses, which I use for my landscape photography. However I have developed an interest in bird watching lately. I wanted to photograph the birds that I see, so that I can look at those pictures at leisure after returning home, and try to identify them with the help of field guides. I felt that I did not have enough time on the field, to look at the birds carefully remember its markings and consult a filed guide on the spot. Too much time wasted in what could be used to watch more birds. I looked into spotting scopes through which pictures could be taken using a phone adopter, but the quality was not good and also they require tripods and are expensive. I also thought of buying the Tamron or Sigma 150-600 mm lens, but although their price is reasonable, they weigh quite a bit. I have some back pain and cannot realistically carry that much weight along with the binoculars. Too difficult for me at the age of 62. So when I learnt of this camera from Nikon, and looked at the sample pictures, I decided to pre-order. Got it yesterday and must say that I am VERY impressed. Took it to the neighboring state park and got a lot of good photos. They, understandably , are not in the same league as those with full frame cameras, but are highly useable and are greatly increasing my ability to learn the names of the birds. Connecting it to my iPhone 6 was very easy. Weight is very manageable. I did not use a tripod even when using at the maximum zoom range of 2000, but still got good, decently sharp pictures. However I do intend to use a tripod whenever I can. But it does not seem essential. I had thought that not having RAW would be a great disadvantage, as I invariably use RAW for my full frame Nikons, but I have actually felt relieved, being forced not to able do a lot of post-processing. Saves time to spend on the field. I did some simple editing in Lightroom, mainly an S curve, noise reduction and some sharpening. Do remember to customize it at &ldquo;U&rdquo; setting, so that you have the spot focusing available to you. Otherwise you may end up with sharply focussed branches rather than the bird. Use fine JPEG setting. I am looking forward to the moon eclipse on April 4th. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This review is edited because someone accused me of being dishonest for not explaining that I use post-processing after taking photos. I also use post-processing with my DSLR cameras and with every photo I have ever taken that I plan to sell, so it actually never occurred to me to mention this. I did mention in my original post that I&rsquo;m a professional photographer and this is common practice in the profession. Here is my original review, except I have placed an asterisk before and after my inserted information.I am leaving this same review for both my new camera and the extra batteries I bought for it, so I&rsquo;ll discuss the camera and battery in this review and copy it and paste it to the other review. After all, anyone buying the camera deserves to know how the battery works. The camera is the Nikon CoolPix P900 and the batteries are Halcyon replacement batteries, not made by Nikon, but work in the camera.I am a professional photographer but I don&rsquo;t take my DSLRs on vacation because all of that camera equipment is so heavy and it&rsquo;s difficult when flying. <em>All I usually do to the images after I&rsquo;ve shot them is decrease the shadows (if needed) and decrease the highlights (brings out the colors in a sky that has clouds). I also sometimes (but less often) darken a photo by increasing the black. I use Lightroom to do this, but I also have a great photo editing software that I&rsquo;ve been using for 7 years that I downloaded for free online and it will accomplish the same thing. I never increase the saturation, but sometimes (very rarely) I&rsquo;ll increase the contrast.</em> So instead of bringing a lot of heavy camera equipment on vacation, I can just bring this one camera since this lens has such a great zoom range. This camera has 83x optical zoom which is equivalent to 2000mm lens. With the lens not zoomed in, it is equivalent to 24mm. If you are zooming in, you can stop at the top of the optical zoom range, or you can continue on into the Dynamic Fine Zoom range which is from 84x to 166x (4000mm equivalent). Dynamic Fine Zoom is digital, but the camera adjusts the pixels in a smarter way, so the image is sharper than regular digital zoom. Here is a quote from an article about Dynamic Fine Zoom: :(Dynamic Fine Zoom) works using pattern matching algorithms to boost the quality of the digital zoom&rsquo;s interpolation. In other words, it makes smarter guesses&rdquo; - &ldquo;a more intelligent digital zoom.&rdquo; If you still need more zoom, you can continue to zoom even more into regular digital zoom up to 332x zoom (8000 mm equivalent). This part of the zoom is not Dynamic Fine Zoom. DFW stops at 166x.This is just what I needed for our vacation. The battery will last for approximately 360 photos. I usually turn off my camera between shots and I don&rsquo;t shoot a lot of video (which I will discuss more later.) On our overseas trip, we had limited time and availability (only in the hotel while sleeping, basically) for recharging camera batteries, so I bought some extra batteries just to be safe. I took over 4000 photos on this vacation and didn&rsquo;t want to worry about running low on batteries. My last point and shoot camera (an earlier model Coolpix) usually needed an extra battery every day and one day I needed two, so I bought two for this camera. I only needed the extra battery once and I didn&rsquo;t charge the battery the night before because all of the bars were full on the battery meter. I&rsquo;ll know better next time!The video is great quality. You can zoom in and out while you are shooting. Also, you don&rsquo;t have to change the dial on the top to shoot video - you just push the red button on the back of the camera to start and stop the video. The microphone is very good. I took some video of kids laughing and splashing in the pool, yet I could easily hear what they were saying and I was several feet away. There is a short lag between pushing the red button and the recording to start. Probably only a second, but you may need to know this if timing is crucial. In quiet situations, the camera makes noise when zooming and it is definitely heard on the video. I just use Microsoft Movie Maker and turn off the volume and re-save the video so it is silent. Or I can use Movie Maker to turn off the camera volume and I can narrate or add music. So that is not really a problem for me except that it is an extra step.The macro setting on the camera is very good and I&rsquo;ve tried the Sunset setting and it was also excellent. I&rsquo;ve tried the other settings on the earlier CoolPix model and they were great too! It has a User setting which you can customize everything you need. Basically for vacation needs, I use either the P or the Auto setting while on vacation. Then if I need to adjust the photo later, I can do so when I get home and get the image on my computer. I also have the &ldquo;U&rdquo; (user) setting set just the way I like it for most situations, but with one change. I use a pinpoint focus just in case I am photographing birds in trees where the camera might try to focus on the closer branches. The camera also has a birdwatching setting which has a pinpoint focus meter and a silent camera click. I use this one a lot too.I prefer to use the viewfinder when I take photos but you can also use the LCD screen. It is a large screen and it can pull out and swivel to almost any direction (side to side and/or up and down). So I can hold the camera up over my head and take a photo above the crowd or I can take a photo from a very low position without having to sit on the ground - all the while having the screen at the best angle for viewing. However, if you have ever had problems seeing a screen in very bright sunlight, you just put your eye to the viewfinder and the camera automatically switches from the screen to the viewfinder and when you look through the viewfinder, the brightness of the sun is no longer an issue. In fact, the only problem that I had with the camera automatically switching to the viewfinder was when I was using a rain sleeve. When I put the rain sleeve on, the camera automatically switched from the LCD screen to the viewfinder so I checked the settings and discovered that the camera can be put on the LCD screen and the feature that automatic switches to the view finder can be turned off. If this feature is turned off and you want to view through the view finder, there is a button to the left of the DISP (display) button that toggles the view between the screen and the view finder.I have used the wireless feature to send photos to my phone and it was easy. I was on a bus that had WiFi. I did everything on the bus, but I would recommend setting this up before you go on vacation. You have to download the app to your phone or tablet first, but basically, all you do is turn the WiFi on the camera on and let your phone or tablet find the camera&rsquo;s network. The manual has good instructions. Connect to the network, then use the app to transfer one or more photos to your phone or tablet. You tell it to look at the photos on the camera and they will all pop up. Then you just choose the ones you want and transfer them. I was able to send photos back home from the bus. At first, I was taking an extra photo with my phone and sending via email, but I kept forgetting to do that, and I wanted to send photos back to family and friends that I had taken with my camera (which took superior photos anyway.) I didn&rsquo;t have any way to transfer photos using my SD card since I didn&rsquo;t bring a laptop, so this let me transfer them easily and email them using either WiFi or the phone service.So far, I haven&rsquo;t found anything negative about the camera or the batteries. Everything has worked great and to my highest expectations. I plan to get a monopod because all of that &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; is hard to hold steady. I had a 42x camera before and I could take steady photos even zoomed into the digital range, so I have a very steady hand, but this zoom is phenomenal, so I will probably need a monopod at least.The attached photos were taken in Italy - all with this camera (It was the only one I brought.)</p>

<p>I am not a professional. I recently picked up birding and wanted to upgrade my Nikon D40 to a better zoom camera that could hold more than a 2GB memory card. I was wavering between buying a nicer zoom lenses or a new camera. Every lenses that I liked was well over $1000 so I thought I would give the P900 a try. I am really happy with my choice. The weight is also a plus - it is light enough that it goes unnoticed in my backpack on a hike.I have added 2 accessories : a ~$20 monopod and a ~$7 UV filterThe two photos of a woodpecker are from this weekend – zoomed out and zoomed in (using a monopod). They were taken mid day with low light.I&rsquo;ve noticed that I have stopped using binoculars when bird watching and now only use the zoom on the camera. While I am really impressed with the quality of zoom, I am let down by the battery life. My D40 could go 2 or 3 full without a charge and this camera can only go 1 day.</p>
