<h5 id="perfect-scale-for-a-fishermen-s-tackle-box">Perfect scale for a fishermen&rsquo;s tackle box.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this as a father&rsquo;s day gift for my boyfriend. Even though he is an avid fisherman, he didnt have a scale in his tackle box. Ran across this one and took a chance. I&rsquo;m so glad I did! He is in absolute love with it. So far he has tried it out on bass and mullet and he said the hook fits perfectly. Its not to big and its not to small. Seems to be accurate on the fish&rsquo;s weight and the blue back-lit display is clear and perfect for night time fishing as it doesn&rsquo;t kill your eyes. I would definitely recommend this product for fellow fishermen.</p>

<h5 id="super-portable-accurate">Super Portable &amp; Accurate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â The hanger is a very handy thing to have for anything under 40Kg. Here is my thought about the different aspect of it:Size:This portable scale is very compact. The hanger has a place behind the scale so the whole thing can be fit in any bag or even a packet.Units:The scale can show the weight in Lb, JIN, Oz, and Kg.Battery:It takes 2x AAA batteries. It last a long time I used the hanger a lot in the past couple of weeks and I still have not seen the low battery sign.Backlight:The scale has backlight which turn on with the device and turn off if no button is pressed after a while. This is perfect specially if the environment is dark as it makes it super easy to see the number.Locking function:The locking function can be enabled/disabled. It locks the number after a couple of second after something is hanged from the hook. This function is good if you want to have the number locked on the screen even after you take the weigh off the hook. This function works hand in hand with the LED above the screen that blinks as the scale is weighing but turn solid when it locks the number and you see a lock sign on the LCD as well. But if you are adding weigh or the item is such that the weighing takes a while (e.g. if the item is swinging for a while, etc.) to show it&rsquo;s stable weight you might want to turn this off. You can also turn it on in the middle of weighing to lock the weigh when you feel it&rsquo;s a better time (all you have to do just move the hanger and as soon as it sens a change in weigh it will go in locking mode in a couple of second.Tare function:This function is great because you can hang something (e.g. a bag) from this scale and tare it (e.g. zero the reading) to make the scale not account for that weight then add anything you want to it (e.g. the bag) and get the weigh of the item only.Hanger size:The hanger is a bit narrower for big international luggage but you can make it wider a bit with a plier OR just have a rope/chain with you that can go around the luggage handle then hang that to this hanger (and tare the wight of the rope/chain to get the accurate weigh). As for other things you can also hang any bag from the hanger (that fits the hanger) then put the items in the bag to figure out the weigh of them (again tare the bag weigh to get accurate reading).Accuracy:The scale is accurate I have compared it with other scale and got the same weigh. In my video you can see how some exercise weights are actually lower than their advertised weigh.</p>

<h5 id="digital-scale-is-a-winner">Digital Scale is a Winner!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got back from a trip and purchased this immediately. On my return trip home, I had no idea how much my luggage weighed when I checked in for my flight. I had purchased a few items on my trip which increased the weight of my luggage and was hoping it was going to be less than 50 pounds. Of course, it was overweight so I was scrambling and moving some of the contents over to my carry on bag. It was stressful and embarrassing as I was holding up the long line. I swore to myself that I would not put myself in this position again. As soon as I received the digital scale, I put batteries in it and tested it. I got my luggage out and put some things in it and proceeded to weigh it. The scale was very easy to use and I compared it to my bathroom scale to see how accurate it might be and both weighed the same amount at 32 pounds. It is compact so will fit easily in a carry on. There are other features that I&rsquo;m sure other people would find useful but I bought this for one reason only and it&rsquo;s a winner!</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-and-sturdy-handheld-scale">Very nice and sturdy, handheld scale!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For something so small, I&rsquo;m surprised by its strength and sturdinessJust pop in 2 AAA batteries (not included) and the scale will automatically power. You can choose from Kg or Lbs, and then weigh things from the hook on the bottom.The weight seems to be pretty accurate, the scale is a good practical size for keeping with my travel accessories, and it works as advertised.One thing I recommend is removing the batteries when the device is not in use. The scale comes in a box with a plastic insert. Within the plastic insert, there is a space for the 2 AAA batteries. That will prevent your batteries from sweating and damaging the scale.Happy travels!</p>

<h5 id="5-star">5 Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this electronic digital weighing scale to measure the weight of travel baggage. It is small, cute, accurate and easy to operate. It need two AAA batteries, weight can be measured in kg, lb etc. Once the weight is measured, it gets locked and can be easily read. It will be automatically switched off after few seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-nice-quality-cheap">Works, nice quality, cheap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For an advertised 88 lb capacity this thing is pretty sweet. I was able to find out that one of my main backpacks is actually pretty heavy, and I suspect it&rsquo;s because all of the zipper pulls are kind of heavy, so I may replace them with paracord pulls. I don&rsquo;t know how much I believe the 88 lb capacity with 0.01 lb accuracy, but even if it&rsquo;s just 50 lb capacity with 0.1 lb accuracy that&rsquo;s certainly good enough. I have no idea what the fishing stuff in the description is about. Did not come with batteries.</p>
