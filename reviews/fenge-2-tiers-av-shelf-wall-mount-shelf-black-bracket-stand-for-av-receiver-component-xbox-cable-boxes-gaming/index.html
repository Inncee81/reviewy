<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="shelves-are-nice-but-the-lag-screws-are-poor-quality">Shelves are nice, but the lag screws are poor quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount rack is quite nice, except for the lag screws that hold it into the studd. The quality of the screws is so bad that with no effort I stripped the screw heads out before they even got close to going all the way into the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; pilot hole I drilled. Also, I have no idea if this was the correct size pilot hole because the instructions did not say what size to use! I ended up having to go to Lowes and buy new stainless steel screws to install this. Not a big deal, just really annoying.Update: I have attempted to place an orignal XBox One on the bottom shelf (weight wise it should not be a problem) but it does not fit. These shelves are tiny; they look very nice but they are not entirely functional. I am going to attempt to find a light weight platform that is larger than the shelf itself and place that on top to place the Xbox One on. I will also tie the platform into place because the Xbox One comes farther out from the wall than the shelf does and I don&rsquo;t want it to fall forward if the weight distribution isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="low-quality-even-at-this-price">Low Quality&hellip; Even at this price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept behind these shelves is great. The pictures show a nice, clean, and spacious space for your electronics. Unfortunately, once you start plugging cables in, it will push almost every device off the front edge. The cable management tabs are a bit confusing and don&rsquo;t really provide any practical use.I ended up returning this item due to some issues that may have been specific to my package so keep that in mind as you continue reading. The package that I received appeared to have been scuffed up and the glass got the worst of it since the black film on the underside had been rubbed off in several spots. After predrilling holes to put up the support, the screws quickly stripped out and I was only able to recover one of them when I was repackaging the item (the other screw had to be drilled out). The clamping mechanism that holds the shelves in place were also ineffective and after tightening all screws, the shelves continued to rock and would not stay level.The seller was quick to authorize the return and processed the refund the day I shipped it back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-and-very-slimline">Easy to install and very slimline</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to install. It took only 15 mins to install. However it doesn&rsquo;t come with a lag bolt option to install it directly to a stud. So, I am giving it 4 stars because I had to go buy two lag bolts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="before-i-talk-about-the-bad-the-bottom-line-is-that-it-does-what">before I talk about the bad, the bottom line is that it does what &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel a little mislead. First of all, before I talk about the bad, the bottom line is that it does what it us supposed to do. My problem is with the pictures, very misleading, the shelves are not as big as they look, I should have held off and did some measuring but the cut off for next day shipping was closing in and I meeded something like this asap to keep the baby from messi g with the cable box and PS4. If you have Dish, your main dvr box will hang over by about an inch on the left and right and about 2 inches on the front, and that was with me buying extra right angle connections to help keep the cables and hdmi from being beint behind it. The PS4 hangs over on the front by about 2 inches, again, had to buy an extra right angle hdmi connector to help keep the cable connected while keeping the PS4 pushed as far back as possible. All in all nothing is insecure, it just doesnt loom too good seeing that they dont really fit on to shelving. Second problem I have with it is the screws it came with suck. They stripped about half way while screwing them in on the lowest torque setting on my drill. Had to wrestle with them to back them out with some pliers and go to Home Depot fpr some lag screws. So I would say if you this set up, start with buying the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> in by 2 in lag screws and dont bother with the cheap tin screws provided.</p>

<h5 id="good-price-confusing-instructions-pretty-sturdy-doesn-t-fit-xbox-completely-and-doesn-t-fit-verizon-fios-cable-box">Good price. Confusing instructions. Pretty sturdy. Doesn&rsquo;t fit xbox completely and doesn&rsquo;t fit Verizon FIOS Cable Box.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m only giving this 4 stars because the instructions were NOT clear at all. I&rsquo;m not sure if I was missing something in my package or if that&rsquo;s just what they were meant to be like, but there was only pictures to show me how to put it together, no actual words. There was a list of pictures with arrows pointing to a corresponding number or letter that the &ldquo;piece&rdquo; was numbered or lettered by. So you basically had to assume how to put it together based on the pictures. It&rsquo;s NOT large enough to hold my Verizon FIOS Cable Box, it hangs off the sides and the front of the shelf, especially once you put the cords in the back. It&rsquo;s NOT big enough for my XBOX One either, especially once the cords are plugged in the back of the box. The XBOX also hangs off the front as well. The shelves need to be a little bit deeper, they&rsquo;re basically okay width-wise, but as far as depth goes, they definitely aren&rsquo;t. Okay, now with the bad things out of the way, ONCE I FINALLY GOT IT UP after taking an hour to figure out what all the pictures meant, I did notice that it is extremely sturdy, and although the shelves don&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;re going to hold things up, it does seem like my cable box and XBOX are okay on there despite the fact that they are hanging off a little. I guess it&rsquo;s a good buy for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-did-a-lot-of-research-and-back-and-forth">I did a lot of research and back and forth &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did a lot of research and back and forth between brands before i finally settled on this one.You cant beat the price first off, and the quality isnt too shabby either. Its a little small if supporting certain game consoles or a less compact bluray player, but its hardly an issue. Hopefully there will be wider shelf options in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="smaller-than-pictured">Smaller than pictured.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is smaller than pictured. Make sure you check the dimension before purchasing. It is way too small for my needs. I would ship it back but I wouldn&rsquo;t get much $ back so it&rsquo;s not worth it. Putting it in the trash.</p>

<h5 id="these-shelves-are-great-for-holding-lightweight-electronic-devices-out-of-the-way">These shelves are great for holding lightweight electronic devices out of the way</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These shelves are great for holding lightweight electronic devices out of the way. Very good construction, fairly straight forward installation. I highly recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy">Sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much heavier duty and better quality than expected. Sturdy and well built. Very happy</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>to many pieces to put together. not easy</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-just-fine-for-me-and-im-pleased-with-it">Worked just fine for me and im pleased with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed more room for my audio gear and bought this shelf to allow me to put my DVD player and the cable box on and it worked out fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="numerous-installation-issues-just-relieved-it-s-finally-up">Numerous Installation Issues,,,,, Just Relieved it&rsquo;s Finally Up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s up - that&rsquo;s all I can say. Not really an easy installation. One thing was there was no bottom hole on the mounting plate that secures to the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="flimsy">Flimsy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like touching anything on it because it&rsquo;s so unstable and feels as if the shelves are going to come right off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked as advertised and easy to install. Would recommend this to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product it holds my Xbox one :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>
