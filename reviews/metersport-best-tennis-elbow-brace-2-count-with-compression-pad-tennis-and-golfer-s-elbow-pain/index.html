<h5 id="id-recommend-to-anyone">Id recommend to anyone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like these braces, they are comfortable, easily adjustable and a much more superior brace then those you can buy at your locals stores. I&rsquo;ve actually thrown my other braces away as these do the job well. Don&rsquo;t have a need for the single sweat band I use it to keep the braces together when not in use. Also the exercises they give you are quite helpful</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="helps-alleviate-pain-from-my-tennis-elbow">Helps alleviate pain from my tennis elbow.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the MeterSport because my previous tennis elbow brace had a different type of velcro that would not stick. I am currently suffering from painful tennis elbow. The MeterSport gives me enough relief to allow me to use my arm to get through the day. The velcro adheres really well. I also like the fact that it has a 1 year warranty. I highly recommend MeterSport.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-kept-the-wristband-thought-and-i-like-the-color">I have kept the wristband thought and I like the color</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this product for my mother-in-law, which has been complaining about her elbow pain. She is a housekeeper, so she does a lot of work wiping, dusting, cleaning - this item is helping her a lot.What about the smell: it did smell as a new item from the stock. the smell was gone after airing it out, wearing and washing it once.I have kept the wristband thought and I like the color. So we both are happy with the MeterSport and the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-were-even-better-that-i-expected">and were even better that I expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The braces arrived very quickly, and were even better that I expected. Works great. I can lift my coffee cup without pain now.I&rsquo;ve been suffering from tennis elbow for over a month. My friend recommended me this brand. And I&rsquo;m happy with my purchase.</p>

<h5 id="ahh-the-brace-i-have-been-looking-for">&ldquo;Ahh, the brace I have been looking for! &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh, the brace I have been looking for! It does not work its way down my arm, it has targeted compression, it arrived quickly, and came as a pair&ndash;you have to have more than one cause they do tend to get misplaced. The searching is over!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-company-to-deal-with">Great company to deal with</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product did not work for me due to the size of my forearm, but Metersport very quickly refunded my purchase and was super efficient in all the details. There is no risk with trying this product, which, by the way, is very well made and a good value</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="by-far-the-best-fitting-comfortable-brace-i-ve-worn">By far the best fitting comfortable brace I&rsquo;ve worn</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>By far the best fitting comfortable brace I&rsquo;ve worn, superior to most other braces I&rsquo;ve tried, I have tendinitis in both elbows so right now the meter sport brace is doing the trick, I&rsquo;m pain free. All around great product and company, there enclosed Ebook is very helpful, all the info you need in it. Went to orthopedic doctor for same condition 2 years ago, don&rsquo;t bother just buy Meter sport brace and read the Ebook because that&rsquo;s pretty much the same info the doctor gave me anyway but not as complete.</p>

<h5 id="the-best">The best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my adult son he had pain in his elbow for about a year. His job requires him to do lifting a minimum of 30 pounds .He has tried many different wraps for it they usual cause more pain than relive it. So we thought we&rsquo;d try this this gives just enough pressure on it .He loves it nothing has even come close to this amount off comfort.</p>
