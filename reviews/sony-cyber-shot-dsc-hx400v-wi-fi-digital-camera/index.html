Product Description
MP camera that takes you there. Even shoot on the move thanks to Optical SteadyShot that helps minimize blur. Use Easy Mode to simplify the camera’s menu functions, plus add fun or dramatic looks with the built-in Picture Effects. It’s ready when you are.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Sony High Zoom Point and Shoot Camera
Closeness is nothing without clarity. Enjoy 50x optical zooming, silky-smooth Full HD video and razor-sharp, 20.4MP pics—perfect for sporting events and all your adventures. Looking to capture the mood of a shot without the harshness of a flash? Low-light environments (think candlelight and campfire) maintain their warmth thanks to the sensitive Exmor R CMOS sensor.</p>

<p>Technology</p>

<p>50x Optical/100x Clear Image Zoom G Lens
Get amazingly close with 50x optical zoom plus 100x Clear Image zoom G lens . Most digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos.</p>

<p>Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and stills
Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and still images with the new BIONZ X processor and Optical SteadyShot (Intelligent Active mode). When the processor and image stabilization technology work together they deliver sharp image quality with low noise and minimal blur even while the user is strolling and the camera is zoomed in</p>

<p>20.4MP Exmor R CMOS Sensor for superb low light images
This camera features a 20.4 megapixel Exmor R CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera’s professional G Lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined Exmor R CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processor delivers extremely fast up to 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080p movie modes.</p>

<p>Keep your subject in focus with Lock-On AF
Lock-On AF gives you the ability to focus on multiple points with subject recognition to keep your subject in sharp focus even when in motion.</p>

<p>Simple connectivity to smartphones via Wi-Fi w/NFC3
Connectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi w/NFC3 control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, the camera also supports NFC (near field communication) providing “one touch connection” convenience when transferring images to Android smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control — a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone — connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.</p>

<p>Motion-Shot Video traces subject movement
Motion-Shot Video traces subject movement on the camera’s LCD for a unique visual effect. Use this playback function on the camera to study form and pathways of subjects.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Create cinematic Full HD video1 in 1080/60p/24p
Record crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p/24p in 1080 AVCHD video.¹ This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HDTV.2</p>

<p>Map your images with GPS tagged photos
GPS records location data and camera direction as you shoot movies and photos. GPS Log lets users track a photographic journey and later view the path and images on a map. Map View in “they were taken. The logged path and images PlayMemories Home” software, allows users to view images on a map showing where can also be displayed on Google Earth.</p>

<p>Enhance features w/ downloadable camera apps
Get creative with PlayMemories Camera Apps by applying exciting artistic effects or retouching images with professional results, then easily upload your photos to Facebook or Instagram. Enjoy added functionality with apps that include Time Lapse, Smart Remote Control, and Direct Upload.</p>

<p>4K quality still image output via HDMI2

<h5 id="the-hx400v-is-a-big-step-forward-for-sony">The HX400V is a Big Step Forward for Sony</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less about a few silly, post-capture, in-camera picture effects. The purpose of a good camera is to take pictures out in the field, not play around with them afterward. There&rsquo;s plenty of time for that, after you get home.The image quality and the quick, effective functions of this model, put it far ahead of the deficient HX300 of last year. I sent that one back after 5 days, but this one is a keeper. Even at full-size, most of its photos look presentable and at normal full-screen viewing sizes, they are sparkling good. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone could put 21 Megapixels on a tiny sensor like this and get good results, but Sony has proved me wrong.The photo and video quality clear out to the end of the 1,200mm lens is sharp. The HX300 lost resolution at full zoom. With video, you can engage the Active Stabilization Mode and get 1.41X, or a 1,692mm equivalent in focal-length and there&rsquo;s no loss of quality. There are several other superzoom brands on sale now, that seem to match the HX400V in some specifications, but their overall performance for all purposes falls behind this one.I recommend getting the Sony ECM-XYST1M stereo hotshoe mike, to put on this camera. It picks up distant sounds well and mostly eliminates wind noise using a furnished furry wind sock. Breathing sounds from the operator are not recorded, which is a problem if the built-in mikes are used. The two elements can be swiveled out wide or pointed ahead for varied pickup patterns. I also bought two sets of Wasabi NP-BX1 batteries and chargers here on Amazon. You don&rsquo;t get an external charger with the camera and having 5 batteries and two chargers gives me plenty of backup power and charging capability. This brand of battery seems to have the best reputation for an after-market source.The autofocus for both photos and video is quick and solid. There is no better camera for shooting flying birds or aircraft. The low-light abilities of it are amazing and the unique multiple-exposure modes make it possible to get good photos in very dim light.There&rsquo;s a KiwiFotos lens adaptor tube here on Amazon that is built to fit the HX300. Although it is claimed that the lens is the same size as that of the HX400V, it is not. The HX400V outer lens housing is 1mm larger in diameter and this adaptor will not fit. Perhaps KiwiFotos will build a new one later that matches the HX400V.Although this camera is listed here and at other dealers in the USA as the HX400 (B), it is in fact the HX400V (B) they are selling. This model has GPS and the HX400 that is sold in some other countries, does not have GPS.</p>

<p>This is a phenomenal camera for the price.I bought this as a second camera for my wife to use while on safari. She&rsquo;s kryptonite to anything technology if it can break or stop working she will find a way to make it happen. With this camera however, she ended up taking some amazing photos on our trip of fast moving animals at distances I couldn&rsquo;t believe. The videos turned out even better.Reasons to buy:-This a great does-it-all camera: Enough megapixels to take photos for large print, good enough glass to make them clear and more-The 50x (1600mm equivalent) zoom takes great photos at long distances with the right lighting - my wife got photos of monkeys at 500 yards that my 200mm/F2.8 would never be able to. The clarity was phenomenal and some will be on our wall, you&rsquo;d swear we were closer-The video quality is outstanding and the slow zoom makes for great landscape shots that zoom in on objects far away-GPS- We were deep in the African bush and when I synced our photos all of them were geotagged, pretty cool-Wifi - Using the playmemories app on Android or iPhone, you can control the camera and take photos or send your best ones to your phone from the camera for sharing online-If you are already bought into Sony&rsquo;s camera line: this takes the same batteries and has the same menus as many others-Viewfinder is good enough, it gets the job done. For better long distance shots, this is a must and is why the cheaper long zoom cameras without an EVF are just about useless-Build quality is really good. The camera is also super lightReasons not to:-The RX10 is slightly more and is easily the best all in one for those not looking for a full frame or compact system.-The Lumix FZ200 and FZ1000 are great alternatives: I&rsquo;d still have bought this camera for the price howeverr</p>

<h5 id="amazing-camera-for-the-price">Amazing camera for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I caught this camera at a lower price when it was available for pre-order only and thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. My primary reason for wanting a mega-zoom camera is for birding, but I&rsquo;ve also tried shots indoors and close up flower photography.I am not a serious photographer, so my review will not be technically rigorous. I do enjoy my casual photography, especially when I come home with a few &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; shots like I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to do with this camera.I have been extremely pleased with this camera. Even in auto mode the photos have exceeded my expectations, even at the highest range of zoom. The details are staying crisp (water droplets on a loon&rsquo;s head, the iridescence of feathers) and the focus speed/shutter speed have allowed me to catch a couple photos I would not have thought possible with a camera of this type.I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning more about this camera&rsquo;s capabilities and becoming more adept with the mega-zoom.</p>

<h5 id="unbelievable-results-from-this-camera">Unbelievable results from this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read a ton of reviews before purchasing this camera. The only negative I read was that it had a &ldquo;cheap plastic feel&rdquo; to it. hmmm&hellip;okay, the body is plastic&hellip;.does not have leather bindings&hellip;&hellip;but doesn&rsquo;t feel cheap to me. After using the camera, I don&rsquo;t care if it feels cheap. The results speak for themselves. Do yourself a favor and go on to the sony site and download the user help guide. A ton of great information in there on how best to use the camera. Last night too a picture of a half-moon and only supported the camera on a tripod with no mount&hellip;.the zoom was phenomenal! I took a lot of macro shots and was beyond impressed. FYI&hellip;the macro is plain old ground pepper. Would buy again in a heart beat if needed</p>
