<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great Purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a neat little compact totally manual washer, it does a great job on getting clothes clean especially if you do a bit of a presoak in warm water then refill add detergent and do main washing action. Sturdy, and efficient and i have NOT made a trip to the laundromat since it was delivered. It has already PAID for itself in time savings, cost and product use. I wash personal laundry, t shirts, jeans, towels, wash cloths, twin sized sheets and pillowcases.. BIG stuff i will have to take to the laundromat but for everyday clothes (one person) it is perfect for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-use">Very easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this and did a few loads in it. It works really well! It takes up to 2 minutes of time to wash, then an optional (but recommended) rinse cycle. The hand crank is very very very easy to turn. Assembly was easy. It&rsquo;s light weight. The suction cups at the bottom of the machine mean business- if you set this down in a tub or on a tiled surface you&rsquo;ll need to put some effort into getting it back up. It holds a lot more clothing than I thought it would.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This item arrived in appropriate packaging to keep it safe from damage while in transit. It came in many pieces which looked overwhelming at first but it was pretty easy to put together and it came with clear instructions. There was one small piece missing from mine, and when I notified the company they gave fast, great customer service and are mailing it out a.s.a.p. It seems to be very sturdy and I don&rsquo;t expect it to break any time soon. I have been using it for three days now, several times per day trying to catch up on laundry since my washer broke. It takes some amount of physical activity so keep that in mind. (I fill it with 2 quarts of water, put in laundry, crank for two minutes, lift into the tub, drain, fill with 2 quarts water again, lift out of tub, crank for 30 seconds, lift into tub, drain, wring out clothes and carry them wet to the dryer. I do this three times and get a dryer load that isn&rsquo;t too much smaller than a regular load of laundry. Don&rsquo;t try to put more than that in unless you have a wringer, it&rsquo;s too much weight for the dryer.) If you are able to use this outside next to a line that would be ideal. The suction cups do not stick very well so you can&rsquo;t count on that, make sure you are holding it down with one hand while you crank with the other. It gets clothes amazingly clean, as good as my electric washer if not better! That alone got it five stars from me. It&rsquo;s a great little machine if you don&rsquo;t mind the workout. I&rsquo;m very grateful to have one.</p>

<h5 id="great-in-certain-circumstances">Great In Certain Circumstances</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received my EcoWash from Air and Water a couple of weeks ago. It arrived in very quickly and was packaged well (see picture). After trying it out a couple of times, I think it is very useful under certain circumstances. I believe it is useful for RV’ers, hand washables/dry clean items, and even for households without a washer that don’t want to spend their life at the Laundromat.The day after I received it, I returned from a 4 day RV trip. We take at least one trip a month and sometimes they last several days. Cleaning laundry, even at RV parks with full washer and dryer is a hassle. I set it up pretty quickly, after reading the instructions. I did my first load with items from my trip: 2 pairs of pants, 3 shirts, all my underwear and a stained by cleaning up tomato juice wash cloth (see pictures). I didn’t expect the EcoWash to clean this washcloth very well as even my regular washer couldn’t do it very well with out bleach.I added he detergent, which was all I had at home. The directions say to add a certain amount of teaspoons of detergent depending upon how much the load weighs. I weighed my load and it weighed about 5 pounds. Then I filled the container with warm water. I sealed the container and cranked it 100 times. It’s easy to crank, and well balanced. I then drained the dirty water into my sink. I refilled with cold water to rinse the clothes and cranked it 50 times. The whole process took 5 minutes. After hang drying the clothes, I found they came out surprising clean. The stained washcloth had visibly reduced the stain, but still needed further cleaning. The other clothes were great. My socks were cleaner, but still had some bottom residual on them.Upon reflection, I decided to do the following the next time. Use regular detergent. Stop turning after 50 in the wash cycle and let soak, and then turn the rest of the 50. I will do the same with the rinse cycle.A few days later, I washed a couple of lightly stained ties and a sweater, which I would normally clean at the cleaners. I used Woolite and implemented the above reflections. They came out great. After hang drying, they were as good as the dry cleaner would do. I saved money there.In summary, with a few reservations, the EcoWash does a good job for the things I tested it on. Not as good as a home washer, good as a dry cleaner, but plenty good for certain circumstances.</p>
