<h5 id="great-swim-goggles">Great swim goggles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>when buying products on-line, consumers rely on public reviews&hellip;these are one of the best swim goggles on the market&hellip;sure, there are others that are expensive; however for the price, it is very reasonable considering the satisfaction return rate of the unit&hellip;it does not fog or leak and it is an easy on/off and will last a while&hellip;i have bought three pairs of aryca goggles for the family..believe me and depending on your budget, don&rsquo;t waste your money on other brands like i have&hellip;i have five other brands that are no good and a waste of money because it leaks and fogs up&hellip;live and learn&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simply-great">Simply Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent goggles, they are well made and look great, really comfortable to wear and very easy to adjust.My biggest surprise was how well these goggles stay clear during my swim, No fog! I have had far more expensive goggles in the past and they didn&rsquo;t stay as clear as these do!Simply Great goggles and I&rsquo;ve just ordered a second pair!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brilliant-for-contact-lens-users">Brilliant for contact lens users!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wear contact lenses and I&rsquo;ve never found a pair of swimming goggles that don&rsquo;t leak and therefore irritate the lenses. Until I tried these goggles! They are great! First time ever I&rsquo;ve not had to cut a swimming session short or leave the pool with sore eyes. I would highly, highly recommend to anyone who wears lenses. Plus they were really comfortable to wear and looked pretty cool as well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had looked at some goggles on Amazon, and then received an e-mail about these. I was able to try them out yesterday, and they are quite awesome! The rubber around the lenses is very pliable, and actually forms a suction on my eyes! They did not leak or fog up at all! The only minor issue is that I don&rsquo;t really need mirrored/tinted goggles for an indoor pool, but these are really great!</p>

<h5 id="great-goggles-historically-bought-speedo-goggles-but-needed-a">Great goggles. Historically bought Speedo goggles but needed a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great goggles. Historically bought Speedo goggles but needed a new pair quickly so tried these. Worked great and a steal at this price. We ended up buying 3 more so the whole family had a pair.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These goggles are great. They are everything the reviewers say they are. They are a combination of comfort, function and even style. I give it a little spit before I begin and have had ZERO issues with either fog or water getting in (after a quick adjustment of course). For this price, this is an excellent deal. Highly recommended!</p>
