<h5 id="nice-mini-quadcopter">Nice Mini Quadcopter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yipa 3D flip Mini RC Drone with LED Flashlight came nicely packed without any damage. This is the smallest quadcopter and it looks really tiny. This quadcopter is very stable, precise and it flies really well and it flips nicely, Its got nice bright LEDs on the each motor mount. It comes with a little transmitter, USB charging cable and 4 pieces of spare props. It has got built in 100 milliamp power battery and it takes about 15 minutes to charge and get about 5 minutes flight out of it.Before using this we need to sync the quadcopter with the transmitter by moving the left throttle to upwards and then backward, once synced the LED on the quadcopter will become solid. And to flip, you need to press the right button and do and flip and itwill beep to let you know that is waiting to flip and once you give the input it will flip and it will turn the flip mode back.It has got nice tight flips and it is really good stable flips. It has got three different rates from the left stick</p>

<h5 id="fast-little-bugger">Fast little bugger!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tiny little guy is powerful. That in part is the problem as well. I thought I&rsquo;d be able to control this in the house but it&rsquo;s just way too quick for me! If you throw it full throttle up it shoots up and smacks the ceiling before you even know what happened! I was starting to get the hang of it after a while and then the batter started to die. I also think the battery dying helped a little as it was loosing some power and became more manageable. Problem is with too much furniture and things to smack into I was picking the drone up off the floor more than I was actually flying. I just need more practice. It&rsquo;s not my first drone but it&rsquo;s my smallest. I wanted to get some practice indoors since the wind and weather don&rsquo;t always cooperate with me outdoors when flying my other drones. I do need to shut it off and a few times after crashing because the remote looses connection with the drone but no big deal. It never happened while flying which is important.</p>

<h5 id="nice-starter-drone">Nice starter drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these since I was interested in a mini drone. This mini drone is rechargeable and the controller requires 2 AAA batteries. To make the drone work, it needs to be powered on and same with the controller. Once powered, you need to follow the instructions of moving the left side controller up and then down to start the drone. The left side controller controlled the elevation where the right side the direction. The movement is very sensitive and will drop constantly. Make sure to be in an open room so that the drone does not break. Mine got entangled in hair but I was able to take the propeller off and take the hair out. Not a bad toy for the price and its fun just need a little getting used to get acquainted with the controls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-beginners">Not for beginners.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its a good little toy but not for first time flyers. Its very hard to control. Mine would violently lose power and regain. I know how to fly drones. The remote is super sensitive. Not for kids. I changed propellers and it still goes side ways even after calibration. Lasted a whole week.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-fun-to-play-with">Really fun to play with</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really fun to play with! The only downsides are that the battery runs out really quick and the blades are thin plastic that get bent easily. Comes with four replacements propellers. Pretty easy to set up and get working.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>HOLY HELL!Its SO SO SO cool and fun.Good practice if you fly FPV.Battery is short but recharge is fast.Good for price and size, flys perfectly at a high altitude low air pressure.</p>

<h5 id="this-was-one-of-my-daughter-s-favorite-birthday-gifts-ever-she-exclaimed-after-opening-it">This was one of my daughter&rsquo;s favorite birthday gifts ever she exclaimed after opening it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband has bigger versions of this but he will never let the kids play with it so guess what I just had to get my daughter for her birthday. She has already had so much fun with this little drone. With the size of this one they she has been able to play with it inside of the house but the only problem is that the cat keeps trying to swat it down like she is king kong or something. It did actually take my daughter a little bit to learn how to use the controller for it because it is was confusing to her to know which way the joystick buttons went and what it did what exactly.The copter actually last pretty long on a single charge, came with extra parts and my daughter has even told her dad that he is not allowed to play with it. I told him she is your daughter and she must have learned from the best. Just one piece of advice do not take it up so far that you lose connection with the copter like my daughter did because other wise it will be really hard to regain control of it and it comes crashing down really really fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-toy">Great toy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its so fast! Little powerful drone. All you need is to charge it and than you manage it with a control panel. Although It has 3 flight speed modes for you convenience, I quickly understood that it would be not easy to play with it at home, as it&rsquo;s flying speed is fast and I was afraid of walls and furniture. But I must say that it reacts on you pressing the control panel buttons at once and a child can control it without any problem.Drone has led lights, which make a great effect in a darkness, little drone looks like a little UFO in a dark sky.My children and my husband like the drone very much and play with it often.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-and-definitely-worth-the-money">Great product and definitely worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product and definitely worth the money. The only reason why we give it 4 stars as oppose to 5 is because of its delicacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<p>A great fidget toy. Worked good for me right out of the package. Great battery life. I would caution that the motors are powerful for thier size and get very hot.</p>

<p>Super fun doing flips and stuff but after just a few weeks one of the motors gave up on me for no reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>awsome cant wait to use it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-for-the-price">Very good for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good for the Price. I rated 4 stars because the machine itself is very hard to fly stable (mostly due to its tiny size) and the battery doesnt last long, but hey its cheap&hellip;</p>
