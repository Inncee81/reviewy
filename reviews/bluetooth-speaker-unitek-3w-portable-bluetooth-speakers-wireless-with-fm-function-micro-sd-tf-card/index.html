<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First things first, lets start with the packaging. It arrives in a plastic package which has details about what the speaker can do, such as hands free voice calls, play music and listen to the FM Radio. You can clearly see the speaker, which I think is a nice touch!I have to say, the speaker was a lot smaller then I expected, like.. a lot smaller! Taking the speaker out of the packaging, you are greeted with an instruction manual which tells you how to do everything with the speaker such as volume up and down and how to power it on. A flat micro-usb cable and a little &lsquo;Thank You&rsquo; card are also included in the packaging!The build of the speaker is really, really good. It is fully metal and is pretty heavy which makes me believe it is definitely real metal, as it is also cold to the touch. It has a nice chamfer on the top and middle of it, which make it look more premium. The speaker grill at the top is also metal which is great!On the bottom of the speaker there is a blue LED light which lights up when you turn on the speaker, and flashes while music is playing. All the controls are on the bottom side of the speaker. There is a button which changes from bluetooth mode, to aux mode to FM radio mode (which interestingly uses the Micro-USB cable as the antenna!). There are also the volume up and down buttons, skip track buttons and pause play buttons. There is a port for the Micro-USB cable and there is a SD Card slot in case you have any music on an SD card.Lets talking about sound quality. It is loud, really, really loud. Shaking desks and vibrating floors loud. It really surprised me since the speaker is so small, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend keeping it up that loud all the time in case it blows the speaker! The bass is really good with this speaker which I love and the mids and the highs are pretty decent as well from my testing! Battery life is great, and I got about 4.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> hrs of music playback with the speaker. It only took 30 minutes to charge from 0-100% as well.Overall, this is an excellent speaker and I would fully recommend it to anybody who is interested in one!</p>

<h5 id="cool-tunes-dude">Cool tunes dude.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In all honesty I didn&rsquo;t think this speaker was going to be any good but was I wrong. This speaker is user friendly, durable, and loud. The set up for Bluetooth was nice and simple. It tells me in a loud clear voice when I have paired successfully. The sound is clear as well as powerful. I couldn&rsquo;t be any happier with my speaker.</p>

<h5 id="nice-volume-range-of-music-for-my-classroom">Nice volume range of music for my classroom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice volume range of music for my classroom. Perfect for nutrition, lunch, and afterschool when I want to listen to music while I am preparing for meetings and taking a break.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worse-case-if-i-don-t-feel-like-returning-it">worse case, if I don&rsquo;t feel like returning it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not gonna lie, I thought $20 in the bucket, worse case, if I don&rsquo;t feel like returning it. Got it today and I think it is awesome! Not high bass obviously but a great sound! Easy to use, and great sound for less than $20. Do it, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="the-sound-is-loud-and-good-enough-quality-for-such-a-small-device">The sound is loud and good enough quality for such a small device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound is loud and good enough quality for such a small device. Compact enough for traveling (the reason i bought it) and loud enough for my hotel room. The bottoms at the bottom are very small and hard to read their function. I figured it out, so happy with this and the price i paid.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="short-cord-comes-with-this">Short cord comes with this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This would be great if the cord supplied was not incredibly short - less than a foot. You can&rsquo;t set it on a piece of furniture &amp; plug it in unless your elec outlets are high up. Mine are all right above the baseboard. Looking for longer cords to replace. Otherwise can&rsquo;t be used!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="speaker">Speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it for my office and it is everything I wanted in a little portable gadget with one exception, The connection and mode change announcement is obnoxiously loud and cannot be muted. I go in and out of my office about dozen times per day and have to manually reconnect device. It&rsquo;s annoying. Otherwise it&rsquo;s great for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-but-great-sound">Small but great sound!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great sound for a tiny speaker. I bought this as a gift, but I tried it myself before giving it away. I was blown away. This is the perfect little speaker for a small place. You great good quality sound without disturbing the person in the next room. Just perfect for traveling because it is super small. You can fit it in your purse! The blue light coming out from the bottom is kind of cool. Gives it a nice little extra touch for darker spaces. I had to give it away because it was a gift, but I hope it lasts a while. Cool little gift if you ask me.</p>

<h5 id="could-ve-been-a-great-speaker">Could&rsquo;ve been a great speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound, love the size of the product, and the color as well. Went to go turn it off, and its like something came undone in the speaker, none of the buttons work anymore.</p>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Started out great but only lasted a few months. Now it won&rsquo;t stay connected. Need to purchase a replacement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds wonderful! The battery lasts a long time! Would recommend. Only suggestion I have is making it a micro USB charger instead.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-speaker">Great Little Speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this little guy on super sale, so that&rsquo;s definitely part of my glowing review, but it&rsquo;s perfect what I need it for, listening to music outside or watching something on my&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="volume-is-terrible">Volume is terrible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The volume is lackluster &ndash; really nothing more than the effect of putting your phone in a cup to amplify the sound. Pretty disappointed by this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good little speaker</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-price-it-s-worth-it">For the price it&rsquo;s worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice speaker for a small space. Wish the volume was a little louder but for the price, it&rsquo;s not a bad buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="such-a-big-sound-from-such-a-little-speaker">Such a big sound from such a little speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Bluetooth Speaker is sleek and still packs a punch! The speaker keeps the high sound quality even when it is on a high volume setting!</p>
