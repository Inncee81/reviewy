<p>Double-slot SD Card Recording for Instant Backup
For safety and convenience, double-slot recording allows you to record simultaneously to each of the two SD memory card slots, providing an instant backup for your footage.</p>

<p>Relay Recording for Continuous, Long-run Recording
With Relay Recording, the XA35 Professional Camcorder automatically switches video recording from one SD memory card to the other when the first memory card becomes full.</p>

<p>Wide DR Gamma (600%)
For natural and realistic-looking image capture that faithfully represents the scene at hand, the XA35 Professional Camcorder features a Wide DR Gamma mode. By suppressing overexposure in high brightness areas of the composition, this mode helps achieve a wide dynamic range of 600% to produce seamless tone gradations, resulting in smooth detail, accurate color and virtually no blown-out highlights.</p>

<p>Highlight Priority Mode
To capture highly saturated, realistic colors and to convey gradation characteristics as perceived by the eye, the XA35 Professional Camcorder has a new Highlight Priority mode that achieves effects similar to HDR modes in other camcorders. By reducing the mid- to high-brightness compression of the standard gamma mode, the Highlight Priority mode helps to prevent loss of detail in high brightness areas. Designed for display on a bright LCD TV, videos captured in Highlight Priority mode should be shown at a high brightness setting to help ensure accurate portrayal of the effect.</p>

<p>View Assist Function that Supports Highlight Priority Mode
When using the XA35 Professional Camcorder in Highlight Priority mode, the View Assist function increases brightness and medium tone gamma in the camera&rsquo;s viewfinder or OLED panel. This allows images to be displayed with the brightness and gradation with which they are being recorded or reviewed, helping to ensure the subjects look natural and realistic.</p>

<p>Intelligent Optical Image Stabilization System with Powered and Dynamic Modes and Auto On/Off
The XA35 Professional Camcorder offers a powerful optical image stabilization system suited to help reduce image blur in a wide variety of shooting situations. The different image stabilization options can be selected manually, or Intelligent IS can use an automatic detection system to identify the proper stabilization mode for the situation. Featured on the XA35 is Dynamic Mode, which provides electronic correction of roll and tilt.</p>

<p>Dynamic IS
Used for image stabilization at the wide end, Dynamic IS builds on translational (up-down/left-right) stabilization, adding roll axis correction, horizontal roll correction and vertical roll correction for five-axis correction. Image distortion is substantially reduced, even when shooting while in motion.</p>

<p>Macro IS
Macro IS corrects angular and shift-type shake in wide-angle shots.</p>

<p>Powered IS*
Used for image stabilization in telephoto shooting, Powered IS corrects for low-frequency camcorder shake.</p>

<ul>
<li>During Intelligent IS (AUTO mode), Powered IS can be set to ON or OFF.</li>
</ul>

<p>Full Manual Control
Custom Key and Dial
A Custom Key and Dial feature allows you to assign functions to an easily accessible key and adjust the settings with a control dial. The functions include:</p>

<p>Tv/Av: Use the dial to adjust shutter speed (Tv mode) or aperture (Av mode), as needed. In this mode the key has no effect.
Manual exposure: When manual control is selected, the dial can adjust aperture, shutter speed or gain. Select items to adjust, such as aperture or other settings, with the key.
Exposure Lock can be set on or off as can the AGC Limit.
Composition Aids
With the Level Marker feature, it&rsquo;s easy to keep the camcorder level for more accurate framing. The Grid Marker provides a reference grid in your viewfinder. Depending on the background color of your shot, you can choose between two different colors (white or gray) for better viewing contrast.</p>

<p>Gain Control
Gain may be manually set from 0 dB to 24 dB in 1 dB increments. Additionally, Auto Gain Control Limit allows you to set the maximum gain limit for the image sensor&rsquo;s sensitivity. With this function, brightness and noise can be balanced as required, and image quality can be maximized in low-light situations.</p>

<p>Power Zoom
Power zoom is available in Variable and Constant settings in 3 modes: Fast (approx. 1.9–60 seconds), Normal (approx. 2.5–180 seconds) and Slow (approx. 4.0–285 seconds). To provide added control, there are 16 predefined steps in Constant mode.</p>

<p>Ergonomic, Portable Design
Weighing less than three pounds including the detachable handle, battery and lens hood – and less than two pounds without – the XA35 Professional Camcorder is ideal for high-action shoots when both speed and mobility are essential, and where keeping a low profile is an added benefit. Though small in size, this camcorder sacrifices nothing when it comes to professional functionality. It features a “seesaw” style zoom lever, manual focus/zoom ring and joystick for easy control and an electronic viewfinder that can tilt up to 45° for low-angle shooting. It also has five Assign Buttons to help it fit to your operational needs.</p>

<p>Two Phantom-powered XLR Audio Inputs with Manual Gain Control
A stereo microphone is incorporated into the XA35 Professional Camcorder, as are two XLR audio inputs with +48 V phantom power. The built-in microphone provides outstanding audio in fast-paced situations while the XLR inputs provide connectivity to external microphones and other professional audio devices. If you choose, the built-in microphone and XLR input can be used simultaneously.</p>

<p>Audio is recorded in 16-bit PCM format at 48 kHz for amazing quality and fidelity. And both the built-in microphone and XLR inputs have the option for automatic or full manual gain control. To prevent variations in the recorded audio level, the dial can also be locked.</p>

<p>The XA35 also includes a 3.5mm headphone terminal with 16 volume settings for accurate audio monitoring.</p>

<p>Ultra Compact with Detachable Handle
A detachable handle provides the user with expanded audio performance and added flexibility. Removing the handle allows the camcorder to be made more compact for convenient storage when travelling. Included on the handle are the following terminals, controls and monitors:</p>

<p>Two built-in XLR audio input terminals with phantom power
Accessory shoe (cold)
External microphone holder
Manual audio level control
Zoom control and record start/stop button
Infrared light
Tally lamp
High Definition Peaking for Focus Assist
To enhance focusing capability, the XA35 Professional Camcorder provides Focus Assist. It includes enlargement, which helps in capturing your subject in razor-sharp focus. It works by providing a 2x magnification of your subject, which is automatically cancelled when you start recording. Also included is color peaking, which shows the shooting object&rsquo;s focused areas in actual colors.</p>

<p>Assignable Buttons for Custom Shooting
The XA35 Professional Camcorder is equipped with five assignable buttons so that the camcorder can be tailored to the specific preferences or needs of the user.</p>

<p>Button 1 is preset as AF/MF.</p>

<p>Button 2 is preset as Pre REC.</p>

<p>Button 3 has no preset.</p>

<p>Button 4 has no preset.</p>

<p>Button 5 is preset as Rec Review.</p>

<p>Improved Infrared Shooting Mode for Extreme Low-light Conditions (with built-in IR emitter and diffuser)
The XA35 Professional Camcorder features an Infrared Mode allowing the capture of video in conditions with little to no ambient light. Improved from the XA25 and XA20, it can shoot at brightness levels that are approximately 1.4 times more sensitive, and allows low-light capture by removing the infrared cutoff filter from the optical path. Its specially designed lens coating allows the infrared light to pass through to the image sensor. Additionally, the detachable handle of the XA35 features an infrared emitter with a diffuser to shoot appealing infrared imagery even in complete darkness. For evening camera crews or nature documentary makers, the benefits of a compact, high performance camcorder for shooting in such conditions are obvious. Without the need to add lights, the shooter can save time on set-up, or blend into the background to reduce their chance of being seen by the subject. Also, the XA35 gives the option of recording in white or green mode.</p>

<p>Connectivity to Various Inputs and Outputs
Not only does the XA35 Professional Camcorder provide the user with incredible control over the image, it also provides immense creative freedom when it comes to inputs and outputs, including:</p>

<p>HD/SD-SDI Output (see dedicated section for more details)

Optional Bluetooth Mic with Two-way Intercom-like Capability
The XA35 Professional Camcorder is compatible with the optional Canon WM-V1 Wireless Microphone. Bluetooth technology allows high-quality audio to be recorded from up to 164 feet away (50m), making it ideal for interviews, nature recording and other situations that call for unobtrusive sound recording. With earphones attached, the WM-V1 Wireless Microphone can also be used as a two-way intercom, enabling more creative control, such as discreetly providing an on-camera subject with direction.</p>

<p>Advanced Display Features: Zebra, Color Bars and Test Tone
Color bars and test tone can be selected and recorded. The color bars comply with the SMPTE standard. -12 dB, -18 dB or -20 dB can be selected as the test tone.</p>

<p>Enhanced zebra pattern (70% or 100%) indicates “blown out” or high brightness areas to help you set the proper exposure.</p>

<p>The white balance control has six available presets selectable through a variety of day and artificial light conditions (Daylight, Shade, Cloudy, Fluorescent, Fluorescent H and Tungsten), as well as two manual white balance settings. Color temperature may also be manually set from 2,000K to 15,000K in 100K increments for more precise adjustment.</p>

<p>Impressive Slow and Fast Motion, including Interval Recording from 2x to 1200x
Slow and Fast Motion Modes allow the XA35 Professional Camcorder to record a different frame rate than the playback frame rate (only in MP4 recording modes), for a fast or slow motion effect during playback. Since the camera is recording real frames and modifying the playback rate, there is virtually no quality loss and maximum image quality is maintained. Additionally, interval recording allows the user to record frames at specified intervals, providing time-lapse recording of up to 1200x and slow motion down to 0.4x of the original speed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using a Canon XA25 for the last year. I loved it so much that I decided to get another, and then I saw that Canon was releasing the newer XA35. All I can say is that this camera is improved in every way that matters. One knock I had on the XA25 was that it had really got muddy in low light. The XA35 has solved that. If you shoot in a lot of low light situations, this camera is worth an upgrade over the XA25.</p>

<p>Awesome little camera. Kinda small but has great picture. It also has live output for streaming or anything which is why I bought it.</p>

<p>We use this camera professionally and it is a star performer, providing excellent image quality and good functionality. We like the included remote control which allows us to zoom in and out without touching the rocker control. Menu settings allow you to adjust the speed at which the remote control zooms&hellip;.so this is a nice feature. We even bought other remote controls as backups and they all work well.I&rsquo;m holding back a star because it&rsquo;s hard to be sure how to adjust/set the audio settings when using external mics. We have had silent audio when a new tech didn&rsquo;t get it right and it&rsquo;s easy to make a mistake as the controls for audio settings, internal, external, phantom power etc. are not at all clear on the camera. We always spend 10 minutes or so double checking this for each use and we still are cautious about it.Other than the audio settings problems we encounter, this camera is wonderful. It&rsquo;s a little pricey but solid and the dual memory sticks make it a professional&rsquo;s tool.</p>

<h5 id="sticking-with-canon-no-more-sony">Sticking with Canon - no more Sony</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stay away from Sony&hellip;this is the camera you want if you want an amateur-ish professional-ish user-friendly camera. Stay away from Sony. Just do it, you&rsquo;ll thank me later. Sony makes things silly complicated with their proprietary file format that requires a whole separate piece of software (that doesn&rsquo;t work right on Windows 10, just sayin&rsquo;) just to get the files into MP4 format. And the Sony people actually said that &ldquo;this is a professional camera so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s more complex.&rdquo; Ummm, no, being silly to use and adding extra steps does not a professional camera make.This is the real deal. Works wonderfully even on Auto mode, and the Cinema modes - while standard on cameras like this today - are very cool. The audio is where it really shines, and if you add an external mic like we did, it truly outperforms other cameras in its class and then some.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>smaller than I was expecting it to be, which in turn makes it more difficult to handle with my bulky hands. I have been used to professional size camcorders most of my career &amp; I adjusted down in size to the DSLR movement, but this camera is even smaller than my Canon DSLR once a lense is attached. But I must say the low light ability that Canon has managed to get from this camera is amazing. It performed better in an extremely low light event than 2 Canon DSLR&rsquo;s, a Panasonic industrial camera &amp; 2 JVC Professional Cameras-Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have the model #s for those cameras, but they were all component output cameras (except the DSLR&rsquo;s of course). So in that area, this camera is spot on for my needs.</p>
