</ul>

<p>This premium articulating mount is designed to universally fit most LED, LCD, Plasma TVs and other flat panel displays from 42” to 70”. This unit is designed to use the standard VESA patterns installed in almost all flat screen TVs with a range of 200mm x 200mm up to 400mm x 600mm. Constructed from commercial-grade, heavy-duty steel, and high-quality barrel hinges, this sturdy unit is rated with a capacity up to 100 pounds. The smooth-motion, articulating design allows for tilting, panning, and extension to find the perfect viewing angle. The arms of the television mount can be extended up to 20 inches from the wall or retracted back to within about 3 inches. In addition, the TV can rotate up to 160 degrees left or right and the tilt can be set from +8 to -5 degrees to find your ideal settings. Convenient openings in the arms and back plate provide space to pass cables and wires through for a clean and uncluttered look. For your convenience, the articulating arms and back plate are pre-assembled right out of the box and the step by step instructions will guide you through the simple assembly and installation process. Certifications: RoHS, CE &amp; ISO-9001. Also included is a 6 inch magnetic level to help you get the perfect installation. As an added bonus, we have included a 10&rsquo; HDMI braided nylon cable with gold plated connectors.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="an-excellent-mount">An excellent mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will let the pictures speak for themselves. The mount is solid, it is placed off center to meet the stud requirement, and the tv is approximately 70 pounds. The television sticks out almost fully extended from the wall, providing a &gt;12 inch clearance. Excellent mount and I trust it to hold my 2000$ investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-stars">5 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before I start, I don&rsquo;t make reviews very often unless I am very satisfied with the product. It took us(My father and I) about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> hours to install for one of 3 reasons. 1) we had to measure the tv and the wall to make sure that the tv was centered. 2) Then we had to measure where we wanted the mount to be and how high we wanted to mount it 3) We didn&rsquo;t read much of the instructions until we got the mount up. This unit is very sturdy, in the pictures I have provided(With a 55&rdquo; Samsung 4K tv) I can explain a few things that some of the reviews have complained about, excuse the mess(this setup is going to take a while to complete), and yes I know the tv is at an angle we did this on purpose. The angle it can go to knowing it is completely sturdy is astounding. The picture where it shows the middle of the mound with a few nuts screwed into the mount, this is where the wrench that comes with the parts of the mount is for. When we first put it up it was slightly offset. We fixed that with the wrench adjusting the angle of the tv and the offset of the television. The hardest part for us was figuring out the 4 metal pieces that make a rectangle to screw it into the tv, but the screw goes in on the holes at the end of the two vertical pieces. This mount comes with everything you need besides a stud finder, drill, and drill bits(you&rsquo;re going to need those). I hope this review helps for those of you that are thinking of buying or already bought the product and have or had a struggle with it.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-sturdy-well-constructed">It&rsquo;s sturdy, well-constructed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount is everything it promised to be. It&rsquo;s sturdy, well-constructed, and I was impressed with the way it is engineered. So why not five stars? The instructions. Here&rsquo;s the thing .. it is put together very logically, and ample options/parts exist to accommodate anchoring choices and TVs. But none of that is explained for you.Here&rsquo;s an example. Where I would want to read:&ldquo;Three sets of screws are provided for attaching the interface to the VESA holes on the TV. Use the set that fits the holes. The two smaller sets of screws require the use of the washer. The largest set of screws do not.&ldquo;Instead the instructions read:(A,B)+G,CReally? Is that Backus Naur or Reverse Polish Notation?There is nothing in the instructions to tell you which way the four brackets are oriented. Would it have killed them to say &ldquo;The longer brackets are oriented horizontally, with the concave side facing the back of the TV.&rdquo; Finally, why not provide a table of the standard VESA mount measurements, and EXACTLY which hole on the brackets to use for that? Instead, it&rsquo;s trial and error.So my advice: Buy this mount. It&rsquo;s perfect for the job. But use the picture on the Mount Factory website to help with assembly. That picture, unlike the one in the included instruction page, is high enough resolution to clearly see what goes where.</p>

<h5 id="nice-mount">Nice Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice mount. Quality hardware. Level included is a nice touch, but the included wrench is not great. Installation doesn&rsquo;t take long if you have an impact driver, only about 20 minutes. Full disclosure, I&rsquo;m pushing 240 and I hung off this thing and it didn&rsquo;t give out, it handles my 65in Sony XBR just fine.One gripe, the bolts which lock the vertical pivot don&rsquo;t hold up well to pushing the TV in and pulling it out, have to keep releveling it even when you torque them down hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-put-some-thought-into-this-mount">They put some thought into this mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mounted several TVs around my house, and this is by far the best mount I&rsquo;ve used.I only shop for mounts that somehow obscure the mounting hardware. This mount has plastic covers that snap on and off to give the mount a nice finished look.This is the only mount I&rsquo;ve ever seen that forgives you if you don&rsquo;t mount it exactly level. The interface between the TV bracket and the wall bracket has a round connector and allows you to rotate the whole TV and tighten it down so if you didn&rsquo;t get the mount quite level, you can fix it after the fact.The materials are sturdy. Comes with all the hardware you need.I am mounting into brick and (yes, there are lots of opinions as to whether to go into the brick or the mortar! I went into mortar) the size of the mount exactly matched my 2 <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; spaced mortar joints! I know I just got lucky but that made it all go so much better that I just had to mention it. It came with six anchors and lag screws and, after looking around for a better way to mount it, I couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything. I did put a little bit of Liquid Nails around the anchors in case there was any crumbling around the holes.My TV is a 48&rdquo; but only 29 lbs. so I&rsquo;m confident this mount and the provided anchors (5 lb/anchor) will hold it well.It was easy to assemble, even considering the non-verbal instruction sheet.</p>

<h5 id="was-very-easy-to-mount-on-the-wall">was very easy to mount on the wall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product arrived as stated.was very easy to mount on the wall. I drilled directly into the 2x4.Most of the work was done by myself. My wife helped with the last process. She bolted the TV on to the frame while I was holding the television.I mounted the 55 inch TV onto the unit. It tilts and turns smoothly.The product is finished in black and packaged well.The assembly instruction is hard to follow but you can figure it out just by looking at the pictures and part number.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-clean-looking-well-functioning-mount">Very clean looking well functioning mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have our TV swung to the side slightly and it is really nice having a clean looking mount behind the TV with no bolts or wires everywhere. The mount is quite solid as well and moving the TV from side to side so we can see it in the living room or dining room is effortless. Assembly was easy until we got to actually hanging the TV on the wall mount. We did have a time mounting the TV because the mount would move every time we tried to hang the TV. The two pieces must be lined up exactly, which is no easy task with two people working off of two ladders. That is the only reason I didn&rsquo;t give it five stars.</p>
