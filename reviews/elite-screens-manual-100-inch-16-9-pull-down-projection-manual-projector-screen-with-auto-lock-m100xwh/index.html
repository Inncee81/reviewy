<h5 id="their-design-flaw-became-my-pain-in-the-a">Their design flaw became my pain in the a$$.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Editing this review because upon seeing it, EliteScreens contacted me to replace the defective one. I didn&rsquo;t realize there is a 2-year warranty when I wrote the following. But they made good on it. Good screen. No complaints.When I got the screen, it wouldn&rsquo;t retract. I called in and they asked me if the left end cap was broken. It was. The customer service rep explained that this happen and that they&rsquo;d send me a replacement end cap instead of having me ship the faulty one back. I agreed because he said the fix was pretty simple. Well, it isn&rsquo;t if you have never done it before.I&rsquo;m pretty handy and have been wrestling with thing and damaging the screen in the process. Aside from Elite Screens allowing a poorly-designed part to continue in production, I&rsquo;m ticked because the CS rep was not apologetic at all, He just assumed I&rsquo;d be happy to fix it myself and that it was no big deal. At the time, I thought so, too. But now I&rsquo;m ticked off.Yes, it&rsquo;s been a while since I purchased this, and it is well outside warranty. I just didn&rsquo;t have time to screw with it since the replacement part arrived. So now I have a screen that doesn&rsquo;t retract and the right side border is damaged from me trying to rewind the spring as instructed. Not happy.</p>

<h5 id="would-definitely-recommend">Would definitely recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is great. It arrived in perfect condition. It is shipped in a box inside a box with styrofoam dividers to stabilize it. The shipping company appears to have treated it very well en route, which isn&rsquo;t always the case. It was very easy to hang from my ceiling using a couple of 50lb spring hooks. The pull &amp; retract mechanism works very well. It doesn&rsquo;t pull it up too fast and is easy to use. It did have a slight bit of that plastic chemical smell that others have mentioned, but it went away after about a week. At least to the point where it is no longer noticeable. The screen had no creases or curl ups, not even the edges. The picture on it is fantastic with my 3200 lumen projector. We have watched at least 7 or 8 movies on it and are very happy with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-happy">Very Happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My screen came damaged (plastic part that mounts to wall was broken off). It was an easy part to replace, but would have required them to replace the entire screen, not just send me the part to fix. I took a credit against the price since I wasn&rsquo;t mounting it there anyhow. Overall i am very happy with the screen, it does have some waviness at the bottom which is only noticeable if you are watching something like espn and the ticker on the bottom has a little movement. I don&rsquo;t think you can beat the experience for the price. Screen is a bit smelly when you first roll it out, had to let it air out for about 48 hours before that went away.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-amazing-amazing">Amazing, Amazing, Amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First, I should say that I did not end up getting this from Amazon. I ordered it from Amazon first, but the screen came damaged and I had to refuse delivery. Because that was the last one in stock at Amazon, I had no choice but to order form Buy.com.So with that said, I got my screen over a week ago and WOW. I am using the Epson 8500UB with a 13&rsquo; 5&rdquo; throw. First it comes in a really nice, stlyish case that the wife likes. Second, its just massive, at 135&rdquo; your in local theater territory. I have the couch at 13&rsquo; starting at where somones head would be on the couch and its very IMAX like. The gain on the screen is very good, I can watch during the day without an issue and thanks to the epson, I can even enjoy it with all the lights on. Blacks are good but don&rsquo;t expect miracles during the day.Overall, for $259, I got an incredible screen that I really love with only a couple small waves that I cant even see when the movie is playing. One tip is that as a manual screen, you may not be thinking about screen alignment. With an electric, you can program it to stop at a certain distance but with a manual its up to you to bring it down to the same level you had before. Because this screen has a black drop, you could overshoot. My cheap solution, was to take a piece of black tape and rap it around the pull string. When it hits the carpets as I pull it down, I know I&rsquo;m at the right spot and stop pulling. Works every time and is wife tested.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-beat-it-for-the-money-solid-no-frills">Can&rsquo;t beat it for the money. Solid. No frills.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have tall ceilings and want to drop the screen lower this has 24 inches of extra black drop at the top. The case is well constructed of steel with plastic ends. The screen mechanism seems quite good, although there is nothing to prevent a &ldquo;runaway return&rdquo; so are if you are using this in a public setting like a conference room someone will break it. The screen is not tab tensioned or anything fancy, so the edges of the screen curl a little bit &ndash; really not a big deal at all and not worth spending 5x more for! This is a solid screen. I gave it five stars considering its low cost &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t need motorized, controlled return, or tab tensioning you don&rsquo;t need anything more than this screen. When first used it had a bit of a &ldquo;new shower curtain&rdquo; smell which went away after I left it down for a day.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-seem-to-be-very-well-made-and-was-easy-to-install">It&rsquo;s seem to be very well-made and was easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Read hope that this would work, but with it not being fixed, static, it waived with in a breeze and causes distortion of the picture. It&rsquo;s seem to be very well-made and was easy to install, will return it for a fixed screen</p>
