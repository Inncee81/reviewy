<p>Introducing amFilm Tempered GLASS Screen Protectors for your iPhone 7 6 and 6S.</p>

<p>amFilm Premium GLASS Protectors are the latest in state-of-the-art screen protection technology. Highly durable and scratch resistant/chip resistant, this strong 9H (hardness level) protector will guarantee your cell phone the best protection against drops, bumps, scratches and normal wear and tear. Get all the protection without any bulk - amFilm Glass protectors are a mere .33mm thin making them ultra-light weight to allow for a &lsquo;delicate touch&rsquo; style screen protector that promises not to interfere with the sensitivity of your touchscreen. To top it all off the amFilm GLASS protectors are designed to be 99.99% transparent to promote an optimal, natural, crystal clear viewing experience. Backed by our Easy To Install Guarantee - simply align the protector with your device and a simple swipe of your finger adheres the protector to your screen.</p>

<p>Please Note: Due to the curved-edge design of the iPhone 7, 6 and 6S, our screen protector is made to be a little smaller than the actual screen of your device. This is to prevent the protector from overlaying these curved edges which can lead to unwanted bubbling and peeling up around the edges.</p>

<h5 id="honest-review">HONEST REVIEW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>*I paid for this item in full, at my expense. I didn&rsquo;t receive this for free or at a discounted price.Of the two screen protectors, one came from a crack (probably occurred during packaging or shipping).Comes with cleaning kits, &ldquo;squeeze card&rdquo;, dust stickers.I was going to return the product after I saw one of the protectors had a crack in it, but decided out of necessity to use the other screen protector for my phone.From the looks of it, the protector is like a firm plexiglass; I applied some pressure (after seeing the crack) to see how it would bend, since I&rsquo;ve seen other reviews of other screen protectors being entirely flexible. (See photos)Packaging sucks, and for that reason this product gets 4 stars. The sleeves that the product comes in are thin and sheer. The protective box seems sturdy by itself, but to protect glass during shipping, not reliable. (See photo, I applied pressure to it and it twisted) Either this box needs to be upgraded, or the shipping and handling needs some work. My product came in a bubble envelope with a hole, so maybe the reason why the protector came cracked was because of that, who knows? The &ldquo;squeeze card&rdquo; was also bent and no, I had not used the product prior to the picture.The phone is responsive to the touch, and works fine with the screen protector.Until further notice, this protector seems to be decent for the price it is. Will report back if anything occurs, see photos and make your own judgment.***EDIT: 7/5/2016I DROPPED MY PHONE! I was in line at a burger joint, about to pay. I was holding my wallet and my phone in one hand, while trying to open my wallet with the other hand, and my phone dropped face down onto the floor. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;1, but I dropped it at about chest level. I was so scared to flip it over and see that my screen was cracked, BUT IT WASN&rsquo;T! Only the glass screen protector cracked a bit in the corner (WILL INSERT PHOTOS WHEN I GET TO BF&rsquo;S HOUSE), but other than that, my screen is completely fine. THANK GOD! I highly recommend this screen protector! It really does work, and I am ordering my boyfriend a pair, since he has an iPhone 6+.On a side note, the company contacted me twice to ensure that I was satisfied with their product, at which point I told them my other screen came cracked. They apologized and sent me a replacement PAIR for free, and this was aside from my warranty. I originally wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything because it could&rsquo;ve been the shipping company&rsquo;s fault, so I didn&rsquo;t want to make it an issue for the TechMatte company, but they were so caring and generous to send me another pair for free.Moral of this review:1) Don&rsquo;t take the chance of not having a screen protector!2) This company has really good customer service and their product is amazing.3) They have a very good warranty!<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> for good product, good customer service, and good warranty! Cheers!</p>

<h5 id="get-it">Get it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product plus great customer service! They sent instructions with photos in package and by email of how to install screen saver. We put one on my husband&rsquo;s phone replacing a plastic screen cover. Amazing things were clear again. Also attempted to put one on son&rsquo;s phone and did not get it on right. So, I emailed customer service to ask how to reapply, if possible, without damaging screen saver. They informed me that it was not possible and then offered to replace the screen saver for me. Can&rsquo;t go wrong this product.</p>

<h5 id="wish-it-had-a-guide-for-placement">Wish it had a guide for placement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s case came with the glass and a guide piece; mine didn&rsquo;t. Sure wish I would have kept the guide piece for another use instead of having to eyeball it.Love how smooth it feels. 1000x better than Otterbox&rsquo;s built-in-to-the-case plastic screen protectors.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-great-customer-service">Great product &amp; Great Customer Service !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Would like to start off by saying – I’ve been using Maxboost for the past two years. Applecare replaced my phone &amp; so I ordered a new Maxboost screen protector. To my horror, I got the “halo” effect – the bubble of air around the edges of the phone. I emailed Maxboost immediately. No reply. Then I got the automated follow-up email you get with a lot of Amazon purchases. I replied to that – no reply.Techmatte doesn’t have as many reviews as Maxboost but I noticed the reviews were more positive. I ordered the screen protector and unfortunately got the “halo”. Honestly, it was not as bad as the Maxboost. But still… really ugly.I got the automate follow up email from Techmatte so I replied. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick their response was to my issue! The representative asked for photos. After I obliged, they explained they are working on reducing the chances &amp; appearance of the bubbles. They offered me a replacement (a choice between film or glass). I chose glass (because no matter how ugly the halo is, a glass screen protector is better than a film one). I installed the replacement last night &amp; it looks great! The installation method is also very easy – holding tabs on the ends to place the protector in place instead of fumbling with your fingers on the edges.A+ ! I think Techmatte’s response to my complaints says a lot about their integrity and pride as a company. Not only did they respond to my emails, but they delivered on their promise on providing a product that addressed my issue.</p>

<h5 id="love-these-things">Love these things!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I bought my phone the carrier salesman tried to sell me a $40 tempered glass screen protector. I almost laughed in his face.This brand is top notch and I can&rsquo;t say more how much I love all the accessories they send with the protectors (wet and dry wipes, stickers etc.) because it just show how much they care about the consumer.I bought one of these for my Nintendo Switch, and for my iPhone, and will continue to buy from them for future electronics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="finally-no-bubbles">Finally! No Bubbles.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been waiting for a screen protector like this for years. Whenever I have bought protectors in the past, I always buy at least 2 backups because I know I will screw up and have to throw 1 or 2 of them in the garbage before I get it right. I got a couple packs of these for 2 iPhones and managed to get them both right the first time! No bubbles, no hidden dust. These are more expensive than other brands, but they are more than worth it. Seriously, these are like magic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="packaging-is-good-wipes-that-came-with-were-great">Packaging is good, wipes that came with were great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would give <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Packaging is good, wipes that came with were great. I took one point off because it is a bit smaller than my previous screen protector. I own iphone 6 and bought screen protector from AT&amp;T so do not remember the name of product but this product fits to my screen a bit tight( width wise). Length wise, it is a good fit. I don&rsquo;t know how this will fit into iphone 7. Protector appears to be sturdy but we will see how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-peasy">Easy peasy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The easiest to install. I just cleaned the screen, placed the glass, and it just melted with the screen. The only thing is- it did not completely cover the screen, a very small gap all around. But with an otterbox case and this glass, my phone is protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality product and prompt delivery. Thank you!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! Simple easy install. If you ever had trouble installing a screen protector, you won&rsquo;t with this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-iphone-7-plus">Fits iphone 7 plus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit perfectly on the iphone 7 plus. I like that it comes in a 2 pack and it has the dry and wet wipes, stickers and microfiber cleaning cloth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok cover. Lasten a few drops before breaking. But my phone screen didn&rsquo;t so I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks good, does the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-bubbles">No bubbles.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work great and go on nicely. They fit my iPhone 7 perfectly. It did start out with a few bubbles, but I got them out with my thumbnail. They squeezed right out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-its-job-fairly-well">Does its job fairly well!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This actually prevented the screen from cracking on the phone from a bad fall that resulted in this cover cracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen protector has saved my iPhone screen at least 3times! I won&rsquo;t go without! 👍🏼</p>
