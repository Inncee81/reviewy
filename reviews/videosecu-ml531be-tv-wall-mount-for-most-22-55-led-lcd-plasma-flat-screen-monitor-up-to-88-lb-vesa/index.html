<blockquote>
<p>I used to install TVs for people professionally, so I have used many different mounting systems. I was looking for something cheap, but reliable to hang a 50&rdquo; LG 50LA6200 LCD TV. I looked at a lot of options both on Amazon as well as elsewhere before settling in this one. I am happy that I did!For starters, this comes with EVERYTHING that you could possible need to hang your TV, with the exception of a #2 phillips head screwdriver and a drill. Included are a complete assortment of screws, bolts and washers (all neatly organized and labeled in individual packets), a double-sided spanner wrench, a very nice magnetic level, and even a 10&rsquo; HDMI cable. The instructions say to use the &ldquo;optional&rdquo; expansion kit for larger TVs. Usually, this is code for &ldquo;kit not included.&rdquo; I was pleasantly surprised to find that that was not the case here. For once, the &ldquo;optional&rdquo; kit was actually included!Installation was a breeze for me, even without instructions since I already know how this works, but I found the instructions relatively easy to follow for those who need them. All of the various configurations for the expansion arms can get confusing, but just try each one until you find the right setup for your TV.** PLEASE NOTE **There is one change to the instructions that I highly suggest, however. The instructions say to drill a <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; pilot hole into the stud for each mounting bolt. Then screw the bolt in with a phillips head screwdriver. When I first mounted this (I wound up moving it shortly thereafter), I followed the suggestions for the pilot hole. Sure enough the screw did thread in easily&hellip; a little TOO easily. The second hole from the top actually stripped out and I was not putting much force behind the screwdriver at all! When I moved this to the other side of the room, I decided to go with a smaller pilot bit. I used a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; bit instead. Granted, you are not going to thread the bolt in with a screwdriver - you will need a 10mm socket - but doing it this way, those bolts are not going anywhere! You could probably get away with a <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub>&rdquo; bit, but to really protect your expensive TV, I would want all of the bite I could get!I also found that the inside diameter of one of the washers was a smidge too small for the bolt to go through. I just enlarged it with a round needle file, but since they don&rsquo;t include any spares, if you don&rsquo;t have a file or another washer laying around, you&rsquo;ll need to get one. Just thought I&rsquo;d throw that out there in the interest of full disclosure.Once this was installed, I was impressed with not only the sturdiness, but also with the complete range of motion. This is fully articulated. You can put your TV pretty much anywhere you want to. The only thing it can&rsquo;t do is move your TV up or down, although you can tilt it to a certain degree.</p>

<h5 id="this-tv-mount-is-beyond-my-expectations-very-well-built">This TV mount is beyond my expectations. Very well built.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I was very skeptical of this product when I first looked at it, lots of people saying it would tear out of the wall shortly after installation and all that. Lemme tell you, they just did it wrong or like complete idiots; you do no use dry-wall mounts for a heavy TV, possibly a lighter TV, and I can not stress the word &ldquo;Light&rdquo; enough. No one should be using dry-wall mounts in the first place, they are not reliable&hellip; plain and simple.Anyways, back to my experience with the product. I have it mounted above my Xbox One about 4 feet off the ground. I mounted to a stud in the wall and right after that, my roommate who weighs around 150 LBS hung off of it for about 5 seconds at the base and it didn&rsquo;t even budge; now that&rsquo;s a tough wall mount if I ever saw one! I put my 40&rdquo; Samsung TV on the mount, and I can extend/swivel/angle/tilt it however I want.The gear it comes with is pretty high quality and especially the level. For an add on to the product the level is pretty decent for it&rsquo;s designed purpose. The packaging is well done and the parts are all labeled well and accordingly. Make sure you use washers on the outside of the mount before you put the TV adapter on your TV, they will save you a lot of grief.I&rsquo;ve had this wall mount for a month so I felt pretty confident in writing a review. I&rsquo;ll add some pictures to let you know the range of motion as well as how the TV looks how I attached the adapter and the part where it&rsquo;s mounted to the wall. I can sit specifically off to the side and enjoy the TV along, I can turn it to look at my PC area so I can play while I talk to friends on Skype or other chat programs and I can turn it to look at my bed and I can enjoy Neflix or Hulu as I lay in bed, nice and cozy.I hope you all enjoyed my review, it&rsquo;s been a blast and I&rsquo;ll be willing to answer any questions you might have.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-with-beefier-support-to-the-wall">Works great with beefier support to the wall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Based upon some of the reviews, I mounted support brackets between two studs and using a heavy duty toggle bolts, mounted the wall mount. It went up in about 90 minutes and is solid! Used heavy duty screws to assure it will not fall from the wall.Kit includes level and cable as stated and is great! Articulates out and nice adjustment of the angle. TV looks great!</p>

<h5 id="great-product-and-price">great product and price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For my purpose, which was mounting a 40&rdquo; LED TV to a corner of work out room, this mount did a great job. I mounted the mount with the included wood stud screws. I pre drilled per the instructions and then mounted the mount. It was a little tricky figuring out the configuration depending on your mounting pattern on the rear of your tv but it has various options. Assembly took about 10 minutes and mounting was not very hard, but you will need a helper to hold the tv. Once mounted you have various options of articulation and tilt which is great. The arm can articulate in either direction which is a great help as I have mounted some that only articulate in one direction (Picture your arm bending at the elbow in both directions or just one direction). I was a little concerned about moving the mount a great deal as it is held on by 4 bolts mounted to the wall (Wood beam in my case) in a vertical pattern but it is more that strong enough. My kids move it all the time without issue. It has tabs that you can tighten and loosen if you want to keep the current position.</p>
