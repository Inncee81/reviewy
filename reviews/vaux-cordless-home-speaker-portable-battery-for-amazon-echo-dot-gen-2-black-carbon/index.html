<p>About the Startup</p>

<p>Describe your product in 3 words.</p>

<p>Quality, Portability, Style.</p>

<p>How did you come up with the idea for this product?</p>

<p>At Ninety7 we are always striving to elevate products and brands through design and innovation. The Amazonâ€™s Echo Dot is a phenomenal device for so many people but had limitations in terms of look, sound and mobility which is what inspired us to design our product. VAUX elevates the Dot from gadget to indispensable home companion and allows for a different look than what is currently available in the Amazon family.</p>

<p>What makes your product special?</p>

<p>VAUX is the first battery-powered speaker designed to hold the Amazon Echo Dot. Our design integrates the Amazon Dot so seamlessly that you want to buy a Dot and our product together. We are an obvious great gift for anyone that has already bought a Dot, but we are also a great value as a bundle.</p>

<p>What has been the best part of your startup experience?</p>

<p>At Ninety7, the best part is making great product and not compromising on quality. We get to work closely with incredible people that know how to execute and get things done. At the end of the day, we just want to make things better and have a great time doing it. That quality shows in our product and service we offer.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="look-ma-no-cords">Look Ma, no cords!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such a clever gadget! I love my Dots, but music just sounds sad over her little speaker. This speaker has the quality of a good bluetooth speaker, plus a battery so Alexa can roam free! Setup couldn&rsquo;t be simpler - drop the Dot into the top and plug it in, that&rsquo;s it! The speaker connects to the Dot via the 3.5mm aux output so no fussing with Bluetooth or wifi, and you get full quality audio rather than compressed over Bluetooth. The battery connects to the Dot&rsquo;s micro-USB port, and the speaker unit has a separate micro-USB port for charging. You use the cord you were already using to power your Dot. The sound quality is good. Not Bose-quality, the bass is definitely lacking, but substantially better than the built I speakers. It&rsquo;s equivalent quality (maybe a little better) than the JBL GO I generally pair to my Dot. It&rsquo;s also LOUD, so definitely turn your Dot down to sound level 3-4 before you plug it in, or you&rsquo;ll get a sonic barrage. That could be a down side, as the only volume control is via Alexa - the speaker volume isn&rsquo;t controllable separately. If you&rsquo;re looking for the softer end of the spectrum you may want to unplug the speaker for that purpose. One interesting thing I noted was that with the speaker plugged in, Alexa doesn&rsquo;t stop playing music to answer questions or respond to her name. She decreases the volume slightly, but the music is still clearly audible. Overall, I&rsquo;m thrilled with this purchase. It makes my Dot so much more functional! I feel like I scored an Echo at half the price!!</p>

<h5 id="dot-vaux-combo-is-the-best-echo-device-so-far">Dot/VAUX combo is the best &ldquo;Echo&rdquo; device so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very impressed by the quality of this speaker. I have a Bose SoundLink Mini II hooked up to a Dot in another part of the house and while the Bose speaker has better fidelity (it better since it cost more than 4 times as much) it&rsquo;s not that far off. The speaker&rsquo;s design and aesthetic is excellent. A second generation Dot sits almost flush with the top of the speaker making it look like it&rsquo;s part of the speaker rather than something that doesn&rsquo;t belong. The ability to grab the speaker and take it with you is huge. Whether you&rsquo;re taking it along while you clean the house or sit with it on the patio sipping iced tea, it&rsquo;s the perfect digital companion.I personally haven&rsquo;t had any issues with the speaker so far. It sits on my kitchen island connected to the original Dot charger. It hasn&rsquo;t turned off, stopped working or any other issues I&rsquo;ve seen in other reviews. I&rsquo;ve been able to disconnect it and take it around the house with no issues. This is a high quality and thoughtfully designed piece of equipment that, in a way, makes the Dot/VAUX combo better than any other &ldquo;Echo&rdquo; product due to its ability to be a small stand alone or a portable powerful speaker depending on your needs.This is by far the best peripheral for the Dot to date. If you have a Dot, or are thinking about picking one up, I highly recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="quality-materials-that-look-very-nice-plays-well-with-good-sound">Quality materials that look very nice. Plays well with good sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality materials that look very nice. Plays well with good sound. Haven&rsquo;t tried it in the battery mode yet. My complaint is that I can&rsquo;t lower the sound enough to use it for playing environmental sound for nighttime sleeping. I have to take the Dot out of the speaker to get the sound low enough for listening comfort.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-dot-add-on-speaker-but-could-be-a-bit-better">Nice DOT add-on speaker but could be a bit better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, the design is cool. You slide the DOT in and it looks nice and integrated. No lag on DOT wakeup and performs nicely. However, as for the audio quality - much better than the DOT&rsquo;s, but not as nice as I expected. I had expected more bass response and this device does not quite get there.For the price, I think it is a good value but if there was one with better audio, I&rsquo;d go for that since we use the DOT for music most of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-extremely-well">Works extremely well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Dot fits perfect and took all of 30 seconds to set up. The wireless feature is super. I can take this on my Lanai and control all the items outside versus having to plug one in. The sound is pretty good. you can&rsquo;t compare it to a high end Bluetooth, but its a lot nicer than the original DOT speaker.Very nice product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-addition-to-the-echo-dot">Perfect addition to the Echo Dot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. Very impressed. The sound quality is amazing and the Echo Dot fits into this perfectly. Excellent design with the connectors covered and the unit charges with the existing Echo Dot power cable. Now my Echo Dot is also portable with the built-in battery and sounds better than my standard Echo that I also have in my home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t be happier with this speaker. I now have battery back-up in case the electricity goes out so the alarm will still go off in the morning and the quality of the speaker is excellent for listening to music. We have an echo and a dot in the house. Wish I had purchased two dots with these speakers instead of the echo. Would have saved money and would have battery back-up on both!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-speaker">I love this speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this speaker! I bought it because I wanted to use my echo dot wirelessly but to be honest, I&rsquo;ve left it plugged in next to my computer since purchasing. What I like the most so far is the increased volume quality for my echo. Be warned though - it can get loud enough that Alexa won&rsquo;t be able to hear you anymore!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="low-sound">Low sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not very loud speaker, will return for refund</p>
