<h5 id="great-little-light">Great Little Light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought one of these lights a few weeks ago for my 6x12&rsquo; chicken house. It works great, is built well and provides a lot of light for a solar bulb. I have attached a photo for reference to its brightness. Will definitely buy more for my sheds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! Works great and charges even in low light and limited daylight hours! Its the middle of winter here- we are getting about 4 good hours of daylight when its not cloudy and it seems to be plenty to keep my light charged for nightly use (on and off a few times - maybe 30 min of straight on use nightly). I have 3 different versions of this type of light and this one is my favorite! Worth getting the bigger solar panel!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="installed-in-my-dirt-bike-trailer-works-great-pics">Installed in my Dirt Bike trailer, works great, pics</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great light, very bright. I installed this light over my work bench in my 7x12 dirt bike trailer. I used a zip tie to hang it over the bench and the output is very bright and lights up my work area nicely when needed, see pics. I like that I can unhook the light and move it to anywhere I might need it inside or outside the trailer. I installed the solar panel on top of the trailer and used silicone to seal it up weather tight. I share the solar charging cable with another led light listed below that I also bought on Amazon: This light below I use in the body of the trailer and leave it on the auto setting so it lights up when I enter the trailer.OxyLED T-02 PLUS 36 Bright LED Light, 480mm/18.9inch Long Rechargeable, Motion Sensor Night Light</p>

<h5 id="this-little-light-is-amazing-easy-to-use">This little light is amazing! Easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been a long time since I have been impressed with a product enough to write a review. This little light is amazing! Easy to use, charges very quickly. I used it in my chicken coop the first day. The light lasted almost all night. It is unbelievably bright. It worked so well that I brought it in the house to show my husband and left it hanging in the dining room for 2 days and to my amazement it still worked 2 days later so I kept it in the house now for 5 more days and it still works! This has went above and beyond any other thing we have tried lately. I have already purchased another. I plan to get one for every room in the house in case of power outages ect. And for only 10 bucks! What a deal. I did place the solar panel inside a plastic container to weatherproof it. Works perfect!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="versatile-light">Versatile light.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This can be left always attached to the included solar panel and used or it can be removed and used in a portable capacity if desired.My intended use will be as a shed light or as a light under the car port area but as I lack a ladder neither is a current option.I tried to offer some idea of the ability of this light in the video, hopefully it is well conveyed.I think for a small area or my small shed this is pretty much a perfect solution.Check the video for more.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-nice-micro-usb-rechargeable-led-light">This is a nice micro usb rechargeable led light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>POSitives: This is a nice micro usb rechargeable led light. Its bright, and has a good spread of light. Last a long time on a single charge. Used while car camping and would use multiple nights(easily 4-5) before i recharged it, though i dont know how long i had it on for each night. Works great outside or hanging inside a tent.NEGatives: Mine only has an 800mah samsung cellphone battery inside it (not 850mah as advertised). The plastic over the lights pops off when dropped but pops back on easily. Cant tell when fully charged, the light for charging never changes.- Not certain how well the solar panel works as its winter and raining a lot.- The one i received only had an on or off, and no other modes as others have reported.- Add a battery bank and this thing could last a very long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-rechargeable-led-worth-it">Cheap &amp; Rechargeable LED&hellip;worth it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super bright when charged! I was really worried about the lumens output when I initially received it. Somehow in the box the switch had been pressed on and it was extremely dimly glowing. I only realized it was &ldquo;on&rdquo; when I tried to turn it on. It got darker and the reflections I thought were there was the light now gone.Anyways, upon charging it with my regular micro usb wall adapter for maybe 20m or so, I hit the button again and now I see stars. Very bright!I really like also that the solar panel that came with it is just a standard micro USB out. If I needed I could charge something else.It also allows for faster charging of the light with any regular USB cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="both-failed-and-wont-charge-after-2-weeks">Both failed and wont charge after 2 weeks!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 2 of these from another seller amd they are awesome! Then I purchased 2 more from this seller because they were $2 buck cheaper, but theses failed to charge after about 2 weeks. The problem.seems.to be in the cable and not the lamp itself. I love these, but not from this seller. The others that i purchased first, have a red and black cable, these have a heavier black cable, which i assuned was good, but its not.Update: the seller was nice enough to send me 2 replacements, without me asking! Thank you!</p>

<p>This turned out better then I anticipated. I hope for a reliable light source that doesn&rsquo;t rely on electricity and this really surpasses my expectations.</p>
