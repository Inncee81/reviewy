<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-awesome-light">Excellent, Awesome Light!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Grow Light!!! I would definitely recommend this one. I have mine above plants in a bow window. I live in Northern Michigan where it&rsquo;s cold now, and not alot of sunlight. I bought it to help my meyers lemon tree &amp; guava tree along in the winter, because every winter they lose their leaves, and don&rsquo;t look well. I have mine hanging a foot or 2 above my trees. My Lemon tree hardly ever got blossoms in winter. I&rsquo;ve used this light for about a month now, and there are about a dozen fruit flower buds developing on every branch right now. I have it hooked up to a timer so it lights up in the morning when the sun would rise in summer, until the actual sun comes up, and then having it turn on again at sunset till about 8:30. It also gives off a very pretty pink light out my front window.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Started a garden indoors with these before planting outside, photo attached.</p>

<h5 id="the-herbs-don-t-seem-to-be-too-happy-but-the-coleus-is-very-happy-with-this-lighting">The herbs don&rsquo;t seem to be too happy but the coleus is very happy with this lighting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m only growing culinary herbs and coleus at the moment. The herbs don&rsquo;t seem to be too happy but the coleus is very happy with this lighting. This throws a pleasant light in the house, it&rsquo;s not too warm-so will be good in warmer weather.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Iv&rsquo;e used this light for a month and it&rsquo;s not that great. The idea of having white lights to see the plants sounds good at first but in reality it is pretty useless. I did some research after receiving the light and found that plants only need red and blue. I should have done my research first. My seedlings sprouted and did great at first. Anything int center that of the tray that got both blue and red light did great. Plants on the edge by the orange and white light turned yellow and would burn. I swapped it out with a different light that has only blue and red LED&rsquo;s and the yellowing seedlings greened up. This design would work better for a single plant but you&rsquo;re better off getting a light that has only blue and red LED&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-but-not-great-by-any-stretch">Not bad. But not great by any stretch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d take a chance on these lights. After all, aren&rsquo;t LEDs a cheap alternative to less energy-efficient alternatives? Well I think they CAN be. However these are very cheap and I suppose I got what I paid for. They turn on, they help the plants grow. SOME. But if you&rsquo;ve been using another type of light you will notice the difference. The difference between these and my old 43w CFLs was (pun intended) night and day. These lights come on, they look cool, they do what they say they they&rsquo;re going to do. But they don&rsquo;t do it very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightweight-and-complete">Lightweight and complete.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very lightweight. Hangs a little funny due to the weight of the power cable on one side. Only gets moderately warm.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ll-buy-more-of-these">I&rsquo;ll buy more of these!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this and a cheaper red/blue light to compare. This is AMAZING and so worth a few extra dollars. My indoor citrus trees under this went into full bloom in January in MONTANA! My mandarin orange tree is now covered with pea-sized fruit. The red/blue light, which is over my herbs and an avocado tree, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing anything at all for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="45w-led-grow-light">45w Led Grow Light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Light weight and sucker is bright like it says. Especially for the price and only 45w. Within the first 4 hrs of having this light over my plants, the leaves perked up apart vertically towards the light. I&rsquo;m excited to see how the plants respond in the long run.Do Not Look Directly Into The Light Like It Says. EXTREMELY BLINDING</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-plants-that-require-low-lighting">Good for plants that require low lighting.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price range and wattage, seem to be the most reliable vs some other &ldquo;look-alikes&rdquo;. Still usefull in cloning and seedlings. Good for beginners IMHO (me).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product but can&rsquo;t grow more than one plant with it. Very good for sprouting seeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-first-impression-of-this-grow-light-is-fairly-good-it-was-easy-to-assemble">&hellip; my first impression of this grow light is fairly good. It was easy to assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Havn&rsquo;t started growing yet but my first impression of this grow light is fairly good. It was easy to assemble, but the cord that connects to the light isn&rsquo;t very durable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quick-delivery-was-a-gift-so-do-not-know">Quick delivery - was a gift so do not know &hellip;</h5>

<p>Quick delivery - was a gift so do not know about performance other than it lights up as I tested</p>
