<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="buy-this-case">Buy this case!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks just like the picture, zips good, the fabric both inside and out is really smooth feeling so will prevent the chrome book 14&rdquo; from scratching. I didn&rsquo;t give this product 5 stars because on the top of the case I feel like if the case was ever drop on the top it wouldn&rsquo;t have shock resistance for the top. There is a seal where the zip is but it&rsquo;s kind of rope like. But I feel like if it was a flap that covered the computer first that the case would provide more protection. So what I did I used the thick durable foam that came with the case I folded it in half over the top of the chomebook then put the case on then zipped it up with the foam and computer in the case. It still zipped up fine even with the extra thickness in it. But you don&rsquo;t have to do that, that&rsquo;s just what I prefer. Works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-really-nice-case">A really nice case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this case. I bought it for my niece for her Kids Kindle. I went with the largest case to fit the Kindle and a set of headphones. The case is very lightweight but feels durable. It has a very soft interior so it won&rsquo;t scratch the device. There is a foam pad insert that you can remove but I will leave it in there for the added protection of the Kindle screen. Now we&rsquo;ll see if it can pass the tests that a 6 year old can put it through.</p>

<h5 id="double-protection-feature-strong-construction">Double protection feature. Strong construction.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect size for an ASUS Zenbook, with dongles attached. There are so many Neoprene sleeves to choose from on Amazon, I am very happy I chose this one.1. Double zipper on top. This is a very sturdy zipper with zipper-pulls that are large enough to grab very easily. The zipper seams are sewn in evenly from edge to edge and zipper action is really smooth.2. Side pocket is roomy and has a zipper (Yay!). I can fit a Logitech micro mouse, mini bluetooth keyboard and plug into the side pocket3. In addition to the padded protection of the Neoprene, the main compartment is lined with a baby-soft small pile shearling-type material, which also protects your mobile device from scratching. I love this added feature.4. The handles are a feature that I was looking for. These handles are stiff and have a strong Velcro closure at the top. The handle is strong and well attached. No fear of them tearing. Personally, I would have preferred more of a canvas/cloth like handle which would be easier to grip. This handle is stiff and a little uncomfortable to grasp ( Handles are a bit big in my hand, so I find I am periodically adjusting my grip as I am walking) However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the overall quality.5. The Amazon price is fantastic! The quality is excellent for the price.I highly recommend this product</p>

<h5 id="inadequate-accessory-space-for-my-needs">Inadequate accessory space for my needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A &lsquo;sleeve&rsquo; is no more a complete case than a shirt sleeve is a complete shirt. It is thin and nicely contains either of my 14&rdquo; laptops BUT the outside accessory (zippered) compartment is too narrow for all but the slimmest accessories. I can get my external DVD/optical drive into it but not a complete power cord. I am a mouse user - and a small mouse is a challenge for this pocket.This sleeve is well made and reasonably well insulated for toting a laptop around - but most of your accessories will need to be brought along in something else. If what you need is a sleeve for the laptop only and a couple of slim other items, it may do the job for you. In the end, it is too limited in size for my personal needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-but-snug-fit-for-a-14-laptop">Works well, but snug fit for a 14&rdquo; laptop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter received a 14&rdquo; Lenovo Ideapad 100s as a gift, and we purchased the 13.3-14.5&rdquo; sleeve to help carry around and protect the laptop. While the laptop fits, the corners are a bit of a tight squeeze to zip it shut. Other than that, she/we are happy with this. It carries the laptop in the main pocket with the power adapter and her mouse in the front pocket. Very bright pink on the outsidde (which she loves) and plenty of protection for your normal back and forth travels.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-sleeve-at-the-right-price">Solid sleeve at the right price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A decent laptop sleeve at a good price. It fits my 14-inch laptop snugly. I personally don&rsquo;t use the handles much, I think it looks odd to carry them like that. The pocket in the front is nice, but you can&rsquo;t fit much. You can put in a USB key, a phone charger, a portable external hard drive, a micro-sized travel mouse; You won&rsquo;t be able to fit papers (without bending them), regular sized mice (at least, not comfortably); laptop chargers, etcThe rubber-coated zipper pull breaks a little easily. The metal only protrudes halfway into the rubber tab, so the rubber broke off with regular storage in my backpack.Still, I&rsquo;d recommend this if you need a laptop sleeve for a 14-inch laptop</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-do-like-this-sleeve">I really do like this sleeve</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really do like this sleeve. It is 15 inches and it fits my notebook perfectly and although I still have the foam in the sleeve with my notbook just in case I do accidentally drop the bag, it fits both perfectly snugged. The material is very awesome and seems very durable, its like a nylon polyester material both inside and out with the inside probably having micro foam bumbs. I also like that it has snatch hadles so I can snap them together. In addition it holds both my notbook, charger and all of my flash drives. Overall I would recommend anyone with a 14 or 15 inch notebook or laptop to purchase this sleeve.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-bag-for-a-7-year-old">Nice bag for a 7 year old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter loves the pink. These are great little cases and give decent protection. This brand runs a little tight, so I bought the next size up (this one is for a 12.5&rdquo; screen Lenovo x220t laptop; the one with that dimensions didn&rsquo;t fit but we will use that for a 9&rdquo; tablet instead ). The pocket on front is just big enough for the wall charger and a mouse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-surface-pro-4">Great for Surface Pro 4!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is just what I needed. Fits my surface pro 4. I love that it has a zipper to keep the mouse and other things in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-14-hp-stream-but-has-odor">Fits 14&rdquo; HP Stream but has odor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice, but has strong chemical smell. I hope this odor dissipates. If so, I&rsquo;ll update. This is the 13-14&rdquo; size and it fits my 14&rdquo; HP Stream with room to spare.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>IT was okay&mdash;&ndash;case a little thin</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-laptop-cover">Perfect laptop cover.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is perfect for a smaller laptop. Great for traveling. Love the hot pink color. Room for power cord and mouse too.</p>
