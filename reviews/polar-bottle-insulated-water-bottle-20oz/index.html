<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the 20oz Polar Insulated Water Bottle in red, as I just bought an entry-level MTB and want to do a mix of single-track and road-riding, both long and short-hauls. I needed something to supplement the need for a hydro pak on short runs; and, for an initial purchase, wanted something that would fit on either my seat tube or my down tube. While I haven&rsquo;t taken it on a ride, yet&hellip; it&rsquo;s still too cold in PA, but Spring is literally only a couple days away&hellip; here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found so far.Pros: The body is a nice, durable, pliable, contoured plastic. Contours cause the bottle to sit a little higher in my cage; but, allow the cage to grab the bottle. It has a quality feel to it, unlike cheaper &ldquo;gimme&rdquo; bottles. The red, mylar-like liner might serve a purpose, e.g., light/heat deflection and minor insulation; but, I think it&rsquo;s the double-walled construction that really serves the purpose of insulating. The outer shell is the semi-transparent part you see. Behind that shell is a another semi-harder white inner wall. The inner wall also feels more quality-driven than those you find on freebie bottles. I can definitely see how this will be freezer safe, given its pliability. The entire bottle body just feels durable, but not so much so that you can&rsquo;t squeeze it one-handed. Based on decent hard tugs, the black strap feels tear-resistant. The cap is well made and seems, despite being more opaque, like a material similar to that of the inner wall of the bottle&ndash;flexible, yet durable. The outer shell of the cap has a textured/contoured feel to it, allowing you to unscrew it easily. The nozzle (which feels like a durable, hard silicone) slides out with the perfect amount of resistance using either your teeth or your fingers. The nozzle is removable (which I really like, as it will make cleaning the cap much easier). To remove the nozzle, twist it in its housing and pull it out of the cap. It&rsquo;s not overly easy to do&ndash;it shouldn&rsquo;t be or it&rsquo;d pop out on its own&ndash;but not so hard that it&rsquo;s impossible. When you finish cleaning the nozzle, pop it back in (ensuring the nozzle tabs are in the gaps provided). Water tests (i.e., topping the bottle off, capping it, and squeezing it as hard as I could) resulted in no leakage. The cap uses compression to keep liquid in it. There&rsquo;s a lip in the cap into which the mouth of the bottle fits&ndash;no gaskets or foam, only compression, but it works (at least for me). I would imagine cross-threading the cap would cause irreparable damage and leakage. Be careful not to cross-thread it; and, you should be okay. The water stream was perfect. The taste of the water in the bottle, after a thorough cleaning before first use, was excellent.Cons: I honestly can&rsquo;t think of any based on what I&rsquo;m seeing and experiencing, which is strange for me, as I really pick things apart&hellip; keeping in mind I haven&rsquo;t yet ridden with it. I’ll update the review after I take the bottle on a ride.General Comments: After reading many reviews and doing a great deal of research, I settled on Polar Insulated bottles, vs Camelbaks, for a couple reasons. Some reviewers noted that this bottle doesn&rsquo;t keep liquids cold as long as other bottles (e.g., the better-insulated Camelbak Podium Chill); however, reviewers that actually purchased both bottles and tested melt-/warm-times thoroughly said the better insulation of the Chill was negligible and not really worth paying more than double what you&rsquo;d pay for certain styles of the Polar bottles. In addition, compared to similar Camelbak-insulated designs, the cap on this thing is going to be much easier to keep mold-free (a huge plus, IMHO). My plan for this bottle, based on all I read, is, for short rides, to ice and go. For longer rides, I plan to fill it halfway and freeze it before my rides. Then, I&rsquo;ll take it out of the freezer right before the ride and fill it up the rest of the way. I&rsquo;ve read accounts of others who pack two bottles and note they freeze the first half way and fill it with liquid and then freeze another solid. By the time they finish the first, the other is semi-thawed and ready to go. Before testing the bottle for leakage and taste, based on all I read, I cleaned it multiple times. First, I used barely a dot of dish soap and hot water on the cap and bottle&ndash;multiple rinses. I then used a baking soda/water mix on the cap and nozzle, rinsing well. Finally, I cleaned the bottle with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> lemon juice &amp; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> water mixture, rinsing well afterward&hellip; money. I don&rsquo;t put plastic in dishwashers. This bottle will be no exception. From this point on, I should be able to do the baking soda/water mix for the cap (nozzle out) and lemon juice/water mix for the bottle&ndash;allowing a complete air dry before reassembly&ndash;and be okay. Thorough cleaning and dry times are worth it, IMHO, to avoid mold that will grow in wet, dark places like any bottle&rsquo;s cap and nozzle.Recommended Purchase: So, do I recommend purchasing the Polar Insulated Water bottle based on my experience so far (and based on all the other reviews I read)? Yes. This was my first Polar purchase. Based on what I&rsquo;m experiencing, I&rsquo;m getting another&ndash;the 24oz, in red&ndash;to supplement this one. The 20 will go on my seat tube, the 24 on my down tube. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t pay above $10 for this bottle, $15 at the most. For $8, depending on the style you choose and the oz you choose&hellip; absolutely, it&rsquo;s a great bargain for a great bottle.In case you&rsquo;re wondering, I paid the Amazon-advertised price for this product. I only write reviews for items I personally use and test. Please know I did the best I could at the time I wrote this review and always welcome both constructive feedback (to make my reviews better) and all questions related to this review (to make it better and help where I can). I will try to address both as time allows, within a reasonable period from the date I posted the review. I&rsquo;m a family man; so, my time isn&rsquo;t always my own. Thanks for understanding.</p>

<h5 id="use-it-everyday-during-college">Use it everyday during college</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect sized water bottle (20.oz). I take this bottle to college everyday so I don&rsquo;t always have to bring disposable water bottles with me. When it was really hot out I would put about 2-3 ice cubes into the bottle and when I drank from it the water was super cold. Then fast forward about 5 hours later and my water will be cool&ndash;not cold&ndash;but cool, which was fine with me since i&rsquo;d rather have cool water in a dry bottle on a hot day, as opposed to lukewarm water in a bottle that is wet on the outside due to the condensation. I have had a few leaks from this bottle (a couple of drops spilling from the side of the cap) but once those drops get out, the bottle seems sealed, so I don&rsquo;t find it that big of a deal.Be sure to carefully choose your design; what you see in the product picture is what you actually get.</p>

<h5 id="does-the-job">does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bike a couple of times a week and I dont like super cold water due to the fact that it can cause stomach issues on really hard hot rides. I purchased this and would use this as my secondary bottle and drop a couple of icecubes and after I get around 20 miles out ready for my first bottle switch it is still sitting at a reasonable temp. Really nice bottle if you are not wanting to suck down 90 degree water on really hot rides, it does the job, good material. Cleaning what ever im not big into that just soak it some water. I ripped the little carrier hold off. because it is sitting in a bottle holder underneath my bike 98% of the time. No leaks easy to open the valve.</p>

<h5 id="three-of-these-bottles-and-one-of-them-works-great-as-far-as-not-leaking">&hellip; three of these bottles and one of them works great as far as not leaking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought three of these bottles and one of them works great as far as not leaking. I&rsquo;m not sure what the difference is in the two but they absolutely will not properly seal. The ones that leak are both the red color but I don&rsquo;t see how that would matter since it&rsquo;s the same bottle but with different color insulation.As far as keeping things cold&hellip;.ehhh it works ok. If I put ice almost all the way to the top and fill in with cold water the ice lasts a few hours and the water becomes room temperature shortly thereafter.On the plus side,it has a smaller section in the middle for easier gripping. My 2 year old holds it rather easily when taking a drink.Overall,if you want a fairly cheap water bottle, it isn&rsquo;t bad. Personally,I&rsquo;d recommend skipping this one and going for one of the Rubbermaid bottles. I&rsquo;ve never had that one leak and even though it&rsquo;s not insulated it really isn&rsquo;t different in how long my water stays cold. I tried these for my kids travel water bottles. My 4 year old cries every time the water drips on him and he ends up drinking out of my Rubbermaid water bottle anyway.</p>

<p>The QC team should revisit their process. The bottle itself is OK but the cover design placement looks like was done by kindergarten kids, and even them might do a better job than whoever prepped these bottles. See attached picture, what you see is what you&rsquo;ll get.</p>

<h5 id="keeps-water-cold">Keeps Water Cold</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was torn between Polar and Camelbak bottles and chose this because people were saying the cap was hard to close off the Camelbak. Please don&rsquo;t listen to those people as they don&rsquo;t know how to use it.My buddy actually has a Camelbak cycling sports bottle and while yes, it is more difficult to completely close the cap, you don&rsquo;t need to! The Camelbak mouth piece is a silicone tip that will keep the water from coming out unless you squeeze the bottle to get water to your mouth. You just leave the twist cap open until you put it in your backpack or something where you don&rsquo;t want accidental pressure to push the water out.That being said, this is a really nice bottle and I love the graphics that you can select for the insulator. My only problem so far is getting the cap 100% on and tightened. The loop that is on the bottle so that you can grab onto it really easy has a ring on the bottle threads where the cap goes, so some times that will pop-op over a thread so when you tighten it, you&rsquo;ll think its tight, but its not. So now after filling it up and tightening it, I squeeze the bottle to make sure that water isn&rsquo;t going to spill all over the place.</p>
