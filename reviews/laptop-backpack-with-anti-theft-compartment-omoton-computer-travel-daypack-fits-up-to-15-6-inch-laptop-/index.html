<h5 id="so-many-hidden-compartments-and-great-quality">So many hidden compartments and great quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such an amazing high quality backpack. Not only is is padded to protect your lapto but it has so many compartments for everything you need. There are hidden areas to store your belongings as well. We have had purse snatchers in Europe unzip and take our belonging when riding on trains and busses without us even knowing. This beautiful backpack has so many hidden compartments it would be difficult even for a professional thief to steal items hidden deep inside this bag!! It is made of high quality material and is nicely padded. This is perfect for school, hiking/backpacking, travel. I am very content with my purchase. It will not disappoint you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-solid-buy-low-key-but-modern-looking-pack-for-work-setting">A solid buy&ndash;low-key but modern-looking pack for work setting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty much exactly what I was looking for&hellip;a backpack you won&rsquo;t be embarrassed to carry into a job site or general work environment. It&rsquo;s not going to wow anybody like a Tumi might, but OTOH, for most of the world, a Tumi is too much anyway. This seems like a pretty good middle ground. On the upside, I don&rsquo;t think thieves are going to target you in a crowd for having it.As someone else noted, the zippers feel a little less premium than the rest of the bag, so you&rsquo;ll probably want to open and close them with some care, but again, this isn&rsquo;t a hiking bag. They don&rsquo;t feel inadequate exactly&hellip;but they&rsquo;re definitely not Swiss.It&rsquo;s spacious enough to actually carry a fair bit. The main pocket is fairly unstructured, so if you carry a lot of files or whatever, you&rsquo;ll need some organization. There&rsquo;s one divider for papers, but it&rsquo;s pretty basic.FWIW, the zipped side pocket is not big enough for a drink or anything&hellip;I guess it&rsquo;s for cables or cords or pencils or something. But you&rsquo;ve got the stretchy pocket on the other side for a water bottle, which I needed.The straps are well padded and overall, everything feels solid. Barring any zipper disasters, looks like a good purchase.</p>

<p>OUTSTANDING BACKPACK!!! Especially the anti theft back design back the pack. I love it! This was a present for my boyfriend, he uses a laptop for work and quite a few more items that he carries every day, the backpack looks durable, it looks great and with enough room for what he usually carries, he loves the support it provides in the back for easy carrying as well as the straps and all the extra compartments for extra storage, the price is reasonable for this great product.!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-and-many-features">Great Quality and many features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality and construction. Very usable and thoughtfully placed pockets for smart storage. Comfortable straps and lightweight. Zipper quality is good and similar to other high end products. Two hidden compartments not accessible from the front is a great feature to stop theft. This is a size that will fit under an airline seat. Very happy with this purchase.</p>
