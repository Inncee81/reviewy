<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="highly-reccomended">Highly reccomended!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I design electronics kits for a living and for one kit in particular which had a 20W+20W amplifier, my customers needed a portable 12V power source capable of supplying at least 2A. My customers and I have purchased a lot of cheap blue and black brick batteries from China through ebay, and time and time again they&rsquo;ve failed after a few charge cycles, and upon opening the batteries up, I found the cells inside were not only lower capacity than advertised (3200mAh in a battery advertised as 9800mAh @ 12V) but also used, and several years old! The chargers supplied were also far too weak for the job, being rated for only 150mA in one case, resulting in a charge time of over two days!I finally decided to give Amazon a shot and after seeing that this battery had good reviews and pictured a 1A charger I decided to order one. When it arrived, packaged very nicely, I could tell just by the weight and feel of it that the build quality was much better than some of the other similar looking batteries I&rsquo;ve tried. I also noticed the two halves were held together with screws, which meant I wouldn&rsquo;t have to destroy the thing to peer inside. So I decided to do a tear down.As you can see in the photos, this battery is very well built, and uses cylindrical cells which are supposed to be a bit safer than the pouch cells, but weigh a little more and take up more space. The circuit board itself also appears to be well constructed. Most importantly though is that you can see the cells are stamped with a date code that indicates they were manufactured only two months ago. No recycled cells here!Finally, after tearing down the battery I reassembled it and charged it up and it works great.So for the price this is the best no-frills 12V battery pack I&rsquo;ve found. It&rsquo;s only a little more expensive than the fake Chinese batteries, it arrived in a week instead of 4-6, and it looks like it should be reliable for years to come.I will note have seen a few reviews stating that the battery would not take a charge. It&rsquo;s probable that those people did not turn the power switch on when charging. While it seems like you&rsquo;d want to do that, the switch must be on for this battery to charge. Which is perfect for my installations actually, where the battery is inside an enclosure with no access to its power switch. I just connect it to an external power switch and charge port with a wire harness that makes use of the included Y cable, and I&rsquo;m good to go.</p>

<h5 id="good-batteries-hold-charge-well-slight-problem-with-connectors">Good batteries, hold charge well - slight problem with connectors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: I&rsquo;ve edited this review from 4 to 5 stars because of the excellent customer support received. The company was very responsive and professional, and their support was so good I just had to bump it one extra star.I ordered about 30 of these for a project, so I had a good sample of them. They worked well, and held the charge pretty well. They were also well built, except for some of them, which had a more fragile power adapter connector pin. Some of the connector pins ended up being pushed inward or pulled outward, but I was able to open their cases and put the pins back in place.The chargers that they came with also worked well, and I had no issue with these. The only other issue with the batteries is that they had no charge indicator, so I had to leave them charging for a few hours to make sure that they were fully charged. But other than that they worked perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="i-used-it-for-a-led-tape-light-suit-that">I used it for a led tape light suit that &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used it for a led tape light suit that I made. It powered two 16 ft led light strips for at least 3 hours. The power was still working when I took the lights off.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-great-customer-service">Works great. Great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to power my 8&rdquo; Celestron SC telescope and AVX mount. Upon opening the box I was disappointed to see the product was broken- the buttons and port were completely loose and fell into the box (picture). A simple email and a quick response later they shipped a replacement to be in a hurry.Now to the good stuff. Comes with a splitter cable, power cord for charging and instructions. The box itself is small and relatively light, perhaps a bit larger than two decks of cards placed side by side. Put the button in the 1 position to charge or power your instruments. A bright blue LED light tells you it&rsquo;s working. Very simple to use really. I&rsquo;ve used it for three nights, each with this powering the telescope mount for at least 2 hours at a time and it&rsquo;s still got plenty of power. Great concept and much more portable and cheaper than the celestron power tank.</p>

<h5 id="does-just-what-you-would-expect-it-to-do">Does just what you would expect it to do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to power a 7-inch LCD display. The display required 12v power and this battery provided just that. I didn&rsquo;t read the weight spec when purchasing and assumed that because it was a large battery case that it was going to be quite heavy. It&rsquo;s actually not heavy at all. I like that the weight is manageable when batteries of this dimension are typically quite heavy. The battery does exactly what it is supposed to do, power my display. I plug the cable into the battery and then into my display and everything works as expected.One of the best things about this battery is the charging/power cable. You can connect the battery to whatever it is you want to power and you can then connect the battery&rsquo;s power pack to the same cable and plug it into the wall. This allows you to power your device and charge the battery at the same time. Nice design.Pros:- Light for its size- Provides the power I need to run my 7-inch display- Power chord is a Y adapter. I can power my device and charge the battery at the same timeCons:Does not include any DC connector size adapters. Should provide a few to accommodate different devices.</p>
