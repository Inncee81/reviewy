<h5 id="i-wish-it-came-with-useful-directions">I wish it came with useful directions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have not used this mouse very long, but since I have got it working it has performed quite well. I rather like the feel and esthetics, despite what other reviewers say. The only real problem with this product is the instructions. They are AWEFUL. I consider myself to be relatively tech savvy, and it took me hours to get this thing working. This is what worked for me with a Samsung galaxy note 10.1 running Android 4.3. (Should be similar with most android devices.)1. Find AAA batteries, install and turn on.2. Hold right mouse button, left mouse button, and scroll wheel down together until blue light starts flashing. Now it is in pairing mode. (The instructions say to push the Bluetooth pairing button, which so obviously means hold all 3 of these things down for a second)3. Turn on Bluetooth on device and scan for detectable devices.4. Select the mouse and try to pair.5. If it asks you for a passcode, go read this thread:( it got deleted by amazon: read below)I hope this saves someone else some time.PS: Because my link got deleted I will paraphrase here. On the tablet go to the play store and download an app called Bluetooth Pairing. It is obviously not in English, but it works. pretty much just keep ussing the only button on the screen until it comes up with a text box that has some exclamation points at the end which I can oly assume says something like success. Then close the app look at your list of paired devices, and click on the mouse.</p>

<h5 id="there-were-some-bad-reviews-but-i-decided-to-get-it-and-try">There were some bad reviews but I decided to get it and try &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There were some bad reviews but I decided to get it and try since this was the only one that fit my criteria. I think people who are complaining might be wanting a $50 mouse for $10 bucks. This is a GREAT, occasional use bluetooth mouse.Pros:- FLAT design - it fits in my briefcase on top of kindle!!!!- Power off button - saves battery- Works WELL!!!!Cons:Yes, it does feel like cheap plastic but I really did not want to spend more on a mouse that I use maybe 1~2 a month.I would NOT recommend this if you&rsquo;re going to use this everyday. Spend more $$ and get a good product for everyday use. I spend about $30+ for my everyday mouse. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-slim-mouse-works-well">very slim mouse, works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The good and bad about this mouse is its size: It&rsquo;s very flat, which means it could be a great mouse for travel, because it takes up so little space. However, for long-term use I prefer a mouse that&rsquo;s got a little more depth to it. I had no problems whatever with the bluetooth connection and the tracking &ndash; it works well. It has a sleep mode to conserve battery life, and a simple double-click on the left button wakes it up immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-good">It&rsquo;s Good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this only after reading all the other reviews. I lowered my expectations a little, after all this is a $10 bluetooth mouse.This thing looks great for $10 almost a perfect replica of the apply mighty mouse. The only thing that gives it away is the ugly &ldquo;Bluetooth 3.0 Print&rdquo; idk why HDE choose to do this I mean it probably cost more to print that on there and it&rsquo;s pretty obvious this is a bluetooth mouse.The build quality is ok. This thing is completely plastic. The &ldquo;Black&rdquo; model has a slight glitter effect on the paint, nothing to distracting but it&rsquo;s definitely not a flat black.As for as the actual performance, its ok. You have to change the DPI until it works for you. (Might have something to do with my Surface Pro&rsquo;s High Res Screen)Would definitely recommend to somebody who wants a cheap and good looking mouse. If you want an ultra precise and high quality mouse then you should be looking in a different price range.</p>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed-for-my-nook">Just What I Needed For My Nook!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First, I am not compensated in any way to write this review. That&rsquo;s important, because, if you are like me, you are wondering how many of these reviews actually come from people who have used the product objectively, and are offering their candid opinion. So, jokes about still using a Nook aside, I have to say that I went from hating my tablet, to loving it. I&rsquo;m a real estate agent, so I have a serious need for mobile computing, and until I came upon this mouse, my fat fingers were making using my Nook a complete nightmare. But once I had this mouse up and running, my tablet became my new &lsquo;go-to&rsquo; computing device, even over my laptop. Starting with my first impressions when I opened the packaging, I felt like the mouse was not as small as I had hoped, but it is still smaller than the bluetooth mouse I use for my laptop. The feel is admittedly cheap and plastic-y. Pairing the mouse to my Nook was not easy&hellip;I followed the instructions, but they were not the clearest. Ultimately, I got frustrated and just Google-ed the pairing instructions. I advise you to download the bluetooth pairing app from Google Play, as you will save yourself a ton of frustration. Once the mouse was paired and connected, I was instantly over-joyed that I made this purchase. My Nook is so much more capable, and efficient, without all the multiple finger taps and incorrect selections. Who knew that I could work just as quickly on my cheap Nook as I can on my laptop. And I love that the bluetooth mouse works perfectly while the bluetooth keyboard is paired and connected as well. The battery life has surprised me, as well&hellip;I expected a fairly short battery life, but I&rsquo;ve yet to replace the batteries, and I think it&rsquo;s been about a month. Also, I love that you can adjust the speed of the pointer&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if that is unique to the mouse, or if that&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Nook thing&rsquo;, but it really helps as the speed of the mouse right out of the package is a little fast, and hard to get used to. The only things I&rsquo;d like to see changed are the feel of the product, and the ease of connecting it to the computing device. For the price, I am super thrilled with this product, though.</p>
