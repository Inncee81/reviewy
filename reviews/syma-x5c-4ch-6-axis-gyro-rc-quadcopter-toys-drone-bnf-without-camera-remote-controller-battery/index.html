<h5 id="complete-replacement-for-my-crashed-x5c-just-add-radio-and-camera">Complete replacement for my crashed X5C. Just add radio and camera.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love that you can buy a complete replacement this inexpensively. My son&rsquo;s X5C got stuck in a tall pine. After throwing pine cones, baseballs, rocks, and sticks at it, a friend finally knocked it down with a paintball. In addition to busting a hole in the body and splattering paint inside, the paintball freed up the drone so that it could fall gently&hellip;into the river. By the time we fished it out it was toast. Rather than replace the body, motors, and controller board, I simply ordered a BNF replacement from Amazon and we were flying again in two days.BNF stands for bind and fly. This means that you have to supply your own controller and camera. In our case we just used the controller from the broken drone.</p>

<h5 id="easy-5-stars">Easy 5 Stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m addicted to this quad!I bought this bare-bones X5C-1 as a second flyer for myself, as I already have a heavily-modified X5C-1 and transmitter. I recently ordered two more for my older two boys as their first official beginner quadcopters. Then I ordered another one for their grandpa to fly, and yet another pair for my best friend and his oldest son as a birthday present. My boys already have five Syma X11/X12 transmitters from last Christmas, so everyone mentioned gets one. The X11/X12 controller works great for the X5C-1&hellip; it provides great flight range and its a nice small size, perfect for smaller hands and those who are used to Sony Playstation-type controllers. A Syma X8C transmitter works great if you have bigger hands, and gives you way more flight range than a stock X5C-1 transmitter.Before buying, make sure you have a suitable Syma transmitter, or buy an X5C-1 that already has one. This one does not.That said&hellip; anyone who is considering buying their first quadcopter needs to own the legendary Syma X5C-1. You simply will not find a better beginner quadcopter for the price. If you watch X5C-1 realated YouTube videos, they will get you hooked fast. Experienced pilots praise the X5C-1 for its ease of use and overall performance&hellip; but the best feature of this quad, hands-down, is its amazing flight stability. If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a perfect beginner quad, your search is officially over. Durability is impressive&hellip; it is simply overbuilt, and it withstands more crashes and impacts than you would think possible from something considered a &ldquo;toy&rdquo;. Parts are easily replaced or upgraded if damaged&hellip; and cheap.The X5C-1 makes an excellent budget sport flyer. I recommend flying this quad without the camera, prop guards and tall landing gear installed, as it is much more fun to fly without the extra weight. I also recommend buying larger capacity batteries for extended flight times. Based on my experience, 850mAh batteries are the perfect size for the X5C-1&hellip; they fit great and are only 2g heavier than the stock 500mAh batteries. If you desire even longer flight times and don&rsquo;t mind sacrificing a little performance, heavier 1200mAh batteries can also be used with removal of the battery door support bar. I also recommend buying a carrying case for safe transport and storage, and a decent $50-up lipo charger for keeping your batteries at peak performance. The cheap ones supplied with the batteries are very poor quality and are not good for battery longevity and performance.When your X5C-1 flight skills have progressed and you want to step things up a notch, it can easily become a cheap performance-orientated quadcopter with some basic weight reduction and upgraded propellers. The X5C-1 body has no less than 26 screws holding it together, most of which can be removed without significantly affecting its structural integrity. After weight is removed, install larger more powerful Syma X5HC/X5HW propellers.The larger blades are slightly heavier than stock, but with the weight reduction they will give you a ridiculous amount of thrust, faster flying speeds, quicker handling characteristics, and longer flight times as a bonus. For a lightened X5C-1, I do recommend using heavier 1200mAh batteries in breezy conditions&hellip; the extra weight and better center of gravity help stability immensely.Easily modify the transmitter antenna for longer flight range (highly recommended 1st mod). Customize the X5C-1 further by upgrading to bigger and/or faster motors. Install a good FPV camera if you want, and have a blast doing so. All this while learning basic soldering techniques and gaining more flight time. Paint or customize the quad however you desire. Turn it into a great video drone using a quality micro camera. The list goes on and on. The Syma X5C-1 has to be the best &ldquo;bang-for-your-buck&rdquo; hobby quad available today, for both beginner and experienced pilots alike. It&rsquo;s WAY more than just a toy.Easy 5 stars!</p>

<h5 id="best-beginner-quad-around">Best beginner quad around!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Syma X5C is the BEST beginner quad to be had. It only gives you the very basic controls with no RTH or headless mode. But it&rsquo;s cheap, rugged, easy to fly and replacement parts are cheap and easy to get just about anywhere (e.g. eBay, Amazon, Gearbest, Banggood, TomTop, etc.).You SHOULD get extra batteries because of it&rsquo;s short (5-6 minute) flight time. So that way you can charge up a buncha batteries in advance and have an enjoyable <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour or so of flying time. Also, be sure to &ldquo;break in&rdquo; the motors before your first flight to give them additional life before they burn out, and they WILL burn out after a while. Replacement motors are also cheap and not too hard to replace.The X5C was my first quad and I&rsquo;ll always treasure the time I learned to fly with it.</p>

<h5 id="the-perfect-drone-for-a-beginner-if-you-are-thinking-of-buying-one-of-these-you-ve-already-thoug-buy-now-and-you-will-not-regre">The perfect drone for a beginner, if you are thinking of buying one of these you&rsquo;ve already thoug buy now and you will not regre</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best drone to buy especially if you are an amateur. However the motors will burn out after a lot of use I&rsquo;m on my third one now and I have replaced all of the motors the batteries over and over again and it will not fly so I am currently giving up on this brand and I&rsquo;m going to go up to the next level which is the 200 to $300 level I have found that anything over $100 still most of them do not come close to what this can do and how much fun it is. I gave it 4 stars because it does not last long and replacing parts don&rsquo;t work more often than they should my voice is if you have a broken down drone buy another drone that&rsquo;s already built just without the remote control and camera when you get into changing motors its not worth it especially at this level do your research and last but not least go slow very slow for your first time will be like me and get your first one stuck in a hundred twenty five foot in 20 minutes</p>

<h5 id="great-toy-to-fly-and-learn-how-to-master-drone-flight">Great toy to fly and learn how to master drone flight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hands down i truly love this cheap little drone. I&rsquo;ve bought a lot of toy drones over the years and this one has been the best in quality and flight control. I purchased this one to replace an older one that still flies without issues but can tell the motors are getting weak and the case is pretty damaged since that one was the first and fly it all the time. I think if your learning to fly this Syma is one of the best that truly gives freedom to take off, land and just have fun zipping it around trees in the front yard.Well recommended</p>

<h5 id="one-flies-like-a-champ">One flies like a champ</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have ordered three of these now. So far 2 have come with a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; motor. One flies like a champ, the other two seem to really struggle to stay up. One has already had a motor die. They are cheap but can be fun if you get one that works.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-quadcopter-awesome-price">Awesome quadcopter, awesome price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome quadcopter for beginners. This is my second one after one too many crashes with my first one. This thing can definitely handle some beginner crashes. Cheap replacement parts can be ordered, I was just lazy so got a BNF replacement. Great quad for the price! Would certainly recommend it for all ages!</p>
