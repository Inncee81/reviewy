<h5 id="incredible-game-a">Incredible game. A++++</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am 70. I have been watching my grandsons play this game since last Wednesday. This is the most incredible looking gave I have ever seen. My hats off to Naughty Dog in their teem. We are only on chapter 11. I am really looking forward to the rest of the game. We are playing at the moderate level.</p>

<h5 id="uncharted-4-review">Uncharted 4 Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Uncharted 4 ReviewEdition: StandardReviewed on: PS4Uncharted 4 is a third-person, level-based, action adventure game set in modern times that continues the adventures of Nathan Drake. Nathan Drake is once again tracking down ancient pirate treasures with a few of his friends to keep him company along the way. The characters that we are introduced to in this game are very well voice acted and really well developed, my favorite character being Nathan Drake’s brother Sam. The game will have you exploring a wide variety of detailed environments to track down clues for the pirate treasure from snowing Swedish Mountains, tropical oceans, bustling city streets, and the savannahs and jungles of Madagascar. The action in this game is amazing, it will have you going through spectacularly cinematic action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. The gameplay is also great with the third-person shooting mechanics feeling very smooth as you battle your way through the enemies that stand between you and the treasure. The story of the game is very good with lots of mystery and suspense. One of my favorite things I noticed while playing this game is the dialogue that you have with your companions during your adventures, it really helps build the characters and story. This game also features a multiplayer mode that can be fun fun for a short time, but isn’t that great overall especially if you compare it other multiplayer based games. During all of my time playing I didn’t experience any technical problems whatsoever, no frame rate drops, lag, crashes, or even glitches. Even though this game’s characters, story, and action is amazing, the game has one big problem. It’s level based. This means that once you have played through and beaten all of the levels there really isn’t much else to do. You can play on tougher difficulties or spend in game points (that you get by finding hidden collectibles throughout the game) on neat graphic filters, like cell shaded, and gameplay modifiers, like slow motion. These can be entertaining for a little bit, but that’s it. Overall, I had a ton of fun driving through city streets in intense car chases and solving various puzzles to find the next clue to the pirate treasure’s location with an amazing cast of characters and an especially awesome ending. I just wish there would&rsquo;ve been more to do after it was all over. I’d give it a 8.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.</p>

<h5 id="the-voice-actors-do-a-great-job-of-bringing-life-to-the-characters">The voice actors do a great job of bringing life to the characters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Feeling betrayed by Square Enix for forcing PS4 members to wait a year after the release of Rise of the Tomb Raider, I dove into the Nathan Drake series. Most recently Naughty Dog has caused me to forget about Lara through non-stop action, visually stunning graphics, breathtaking environments, and rich character and story development found in Uncharted 4.The storyline and characters place Uncharted 4 into a league of its own. The voice actors do a great job of bringing life to the characters, it’s easy to become attached. The writers succeeded in developing a great story line without taking away from gameplay. It’s like you’re playing through a movie. I appreciate how the game is organized like a book. There is prologue, chapters, and an epilogue. The prologue is a flash forward to the middle of the game. The first chapter is a flashback to establish Nathan’s relationship with one of the key characters (almost teared up 30 minutes into the game). The game is organized by chapters which accomplish a certain goal and end with suspense. The gameplay and controls are simple, responsive, and extremely fluid. Moves and controls were gradually introduced and never felt overwhelming.Uncharted 4 exceeded all expectations set by its prequel and Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us. Nathan Drake may have just stolen Lara Croft’s crown for the best third-person action adventure franchise. Thank you Naughty Dog, Square Enix, step it up.</p>

<h5 id="one-of-the-greatest-games-of-any-generation">One of the greatest games of any generation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This game has a little something for everyone. The visuals are superb, the story is engaging, and the gameplay is spot-on. I cannot reiterate enough how good the visuals are in this game. I have a gaming PC that is very high-end and I have never played a game that presents the visuals that are in this game. Whatever settings that I would initially think would put my PC above a console be it physx, tress effects and such do not compare to what naughty dog has done. The character models are eerily realistic comma the movement is almost life-like comma and the realistic physics almost mirror real life.If all you like to do is play single player grand Epic Adventures then this is your game. If you prefer fast-paced multiplayer action then this is your game. Even if all you like to do is watch a cool story and you are not much of a gamer there is Easy Settings that make you auto aim on targets thus progressing you very quickly to the story parts of the game. This allows accessibility to almost everyone who would want to enjoy this story.If you have the extra money then the Uncharted collection 1 through 3 plus this game is some of the greatest gaming experiences you will ever have.While it is sad that this franchise is over comma it is one that is filled with highlights. It is never dull and you know that naughty dog is presenting you with their very best and is not just trying to milk a franchise.</p>
