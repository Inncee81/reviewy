<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-alternative-to-the-expensive-brands">Great alternative to the expensive brands!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the past 2 years I have owned the Beats earbuds (not wireless) and was very satisfied with the quality with the exception of the fact that the buds always fell out when I was running. About a month ago, my Beats broke and after inquiring with their customer service, they told me I would have to pay $60 to get a pair of $100 headphones fixed, which I felt was absolutely ridiculous. After getting an Amazon gift card for Christmas, I decided not to spend the $200 on a pair of the wireless Beats and instead opted for the Hussar wireless earbuds instead. I am extremely happy with my decision! Not only did I save $160, but the Hussar headphones have good sound quality and I am very pleased with how long the battery lasts. I charged my headphones the first day I received them, and it&rsquo;s been a week using them almost everyday and there&rsquo;s still 60% battery life left on them. In addition, the headphones look great on the ear and are very light compared to some other wireless headphones I have tried in the past which is especially useful when I am doing strength training that involves a lot of up and down movements.My only criticism (hence, 4 stars instead of 5) for the product is when it comes to sound quality with songs that have a heavy bass beat in the background. While the quality is by no means bad, the song gets a little bit muffled and begins to sound a little choppy. However, in the large scheme of things the pros of the headphones greatly outweigh this one negative.Overall, this product is great for the price and I don&rsquo;t find the sound quality to much different than that of the Beats earbuds I used to own. I recommend the headphones to anyone who is very active and cannot bring themselves to spend hundreds of dollars on the more expensive options.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-very-glad-i-found-these-to-purchase">I AM VERY GLAD I FOUND THESE TO PURCHASE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These cost a bit more than some others on Amazon. However, the sayi\ng is true &ldquo;You get what you pay for.&ldquo;PROsOver-the-ear hooks: There are a lot of Bluetooth earbuds available on Amazon that sound great, but don’t always stay in your ear while you’re running or working out. The over-the-ear hooks on these earbuds solve that issue. I did a quick test by running in place, doing jumping jacks, and doing push-ups, and the earbuds stayed in my ear without an issue.Sound quality: The sound or these earbuds is great! When sealed into my ear canal, I get a good bass response and the music quality is very good. At higher volumes I did notice some bass distortion, but still very good sound quality overall.Controls: There is no remote to flop around and hit your face. The controls are built-in to the earbuds. They are fairly easy to find and use while running, and make it easy to skip, rewind, and adjust the volume.Design: The black and red design of these earbuds may remind you of a certain other, well-known brand. But at a fraction of the cost.Built-in mic: If you receive an incoming call while using these earbuds, you can answer it thanks to the built-in microphone.Bluetooth 4.1: In additional to improved sound quality, Bluetooth 4.1 also has improved battery life for both your phone and the earbuds (as long as your phone is Bluetooth 4.1 compatible as well).CONSIt is a positve negative. I am reffering to their Noise Cancelling: Please note that these earbuds do a GREAT job of blocking out the noises around you. Thus, it is important to use caution if running near traffic or crowded areas and very important when driving or riding a bike.I strongly reccomend to only use ONE EAR BUDa in these situations. You will still get quality phone calls and music at the same time it will provide the ability for you to be alert for outside sounds that you would hear if you are not wearing a headset.Overall, I like the design and sound quality of these earbuds. I also like the secure fit that keeps these in place during my workout.</p>

<h5 id="couldn-t-be-happier">Couldn&rsquo;t be happier!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are fantastic. They hold a charge for several days of partial use. They are loud enough without distortion. So far, no damage from sweat or rain. They are very comfortable for everyday use and also feel good while exercising. In terms of BT connection, they are easy to pair and allow me to connect to multiple devices at the same time. The included case allows you to toss them into your bag without worry of them breaking or getting tangled, or just getting gross. For this price, I see no reason to go with the similar styled named brand version.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about these headphones. The sound quality is really surprising. And when I wear them at work I can&rsquo;t hear anyone! It&rsquo;s a running joke that people will either have to tap me or wave or do something outrageous to get my attention because they are really noise-canceling. My only gripe is that sometimes the music cuts off and becomes choppy but it&rsquo;s only temporary and might be because of my position. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this to a runner, for example. But for the office it&rsquo;s great!</p>

<p>These were just &ldquo;ok&rdquo;. Stopped working not long after purchase. Sounded good when it worked, but gave out after a few weeks. Wouldn&rsquo;t purchase again. =(</p>

<h5 id="good-but-broke-on-one-side">Good but Broke on one side.</h5>
