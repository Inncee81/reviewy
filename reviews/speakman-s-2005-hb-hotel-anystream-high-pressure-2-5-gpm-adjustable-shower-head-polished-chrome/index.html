<h5 id="comparing-two-speakman-units-on-well-system">Comparing two Speakman units on well system.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: We have a typical well system. This review looks at how two Speakman units do on a well system. If you are on a municipal water supply you likely have higher pressure and water flow rate. I also removed the 2.5 gal limiter - more on that at the end of this review.I replaced our old Speakman Classic 32 (4 jet unit about $22 here on Amazon) with this S-2005-HB unit. Below is a review of both units.Speakman Classic 32 (found elsewhere in this Amazon shower head list) - A few years ago, and after trying quite a few mediocre shower heads, we stumbled upon this mighty little shower nozzle. It is about 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; in diameter with a more powerful spray than any other we had tried. It had only this one usable spray setting with maybe two dozens small, powerful streams but it made for a very nice shower experience. The Classic 32 lasted 4 or 5 years on our filtered well water system. However, it was slowly giving up the ghost to mineral deposits. I tried to clean out the jets a bit with a toothbrush but that only made it worse. We liked the Classic 32 unit so much I almost ordered a duplicate but decided to try a better Speakman unit instead.Speakman S-2005-HB - First thing you should note is that this is a big shower head - maybe 5 inches in diameter or about the size of the end of a 2 liter bottle! It is heavy, with a full chrome finish. The female <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; fitting is all metal too, as opposed to some with a female fitting made of chromed plastic. It really has two usable settings on the variable shower control lever.The first lever setting is a 4&rdquo; wide rain shower with a lot of water flow from some 50 streams. Truth be told, it is not quite as powerful of a stream as the Classic 32. However, the Classic 32 has about half as many individual streams coming out so that makes some sense. Move the control lever 180 degrees and you have a very powerful shower message jet. This single massage jet is very impressive and effective - all the more so on our lower pressure system.The manufacturer claims that the lever allows unlimited, variable shower settings but that seems to be a bit of advertising fluff to me. I prefer to call it two settings only as the in-between positions on the variable lever really just split the water between the sets of jets, reducing both nozzles flow to the point of being ineffective in our installation. (PLEASE NOTE: If you have higher pressure and water flow rate, these in-between settings may be more useful. Please remember that I am on a well system).So what&rsquo;s the verdict? The less expensive Classic 32 is slightly more vigorous than the S-2005 on it&rsquo;s stream setting, but not by much. Having said that, the S-2005 does have a much wider coverage on your skin with more jets and it seems like the big nozzle delivers more water to rinse more quickly. The big difference between the two units is that the S-2005 also has that great massage setting that makes it clearly the better shower nozzle and maybe worth the extra few bucks to most people. On a well water system EITHER Speakman unit is better than most any other shower nozzle we have tried through the years!WARNING - Removing this restrictor is difficult so the following procedure is done at your own risk. You may also be subject to criminal prosecution and incarceration, ridicule from your friends, and nasty letters from the Audubon Society for being so &ldquo;ungreen&rdquo;. But much worse, it will void your warranty so you are on you own now!Removing the restrictor - First, remove the black washer with stainless steel screen from the end of the fitting. The screen is easily bent back into shape before reinstalling it so just grab the screen with needle nose pliers and out it comes. Underneath is a round, white gizmo with an &ldquo;o&rdquo; ring in the middle of it. That is the restrictor. After I broke off all these little tabs trying to pull it out whole, I just drilled it out carefully with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; drill bit and took it out in pieces. Rinse it out, reinstall the filter screen and screw the nozzle back on to the shower nipple. It does seem to make the shower even better but it is a subtle improvement at best on my well system. Still, every little bit helps when on a well system.I hope this review was helpful to you. I try to give you the best info I can because I appreciate it so much when other reviewers give me the real facts I need to make an informed buyers decision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great showerhead. Easy install. A little tape, then hand-tighten. Boom!The important part, as mentioned by others who are likely relaxing under a luxurious water stream as I type this:The restrictor can be easily removed. Drilling is unnecessary. All you need is a pair of curved hemostats ($3.60 on Amazon).Picture order goes from Right to Left (Sorry, I&rsquo;m photo-dyslexic).Using the hemostats, first pluck the mesh screen with rubber gasket out.Using the same hemostats, grab the center white, plastic piece.I eventually went between the tabs. If a part of the white plastic breaks off, no big deal, as the whole piece has to come out anyway.By wriggling in, grabbing, and locking the stats, then pulling, it was out in seconds.Don&rsquo;t forget to replace the mesh screenRinse and repeat as needed!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the shower head looks and works fine, it does not live up to the description. It says &ldquo;adjustable water flow&rdquo;, but all it does is change from one set of spay holes to another. I expected to be able to either shut off the water flow or at least turn it down low. Very dissappointed! Also the description says &ldquo;chrome&hellip;.&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s nice looking, but it&rsquo;s plastic! I expected some sort of metal. I&rsquo;ll end up putting this in the guest bathroom and try again for a shower head that I can ACTUALLY turn down the water flow rate.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-shower-head-ever-and-even-better-with-2-5-gpm-flow-restriction-removed">The best shower head ever &hellip; and even better with 2.5 gpm flow restriction removed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Speakman S-2005-HB is the very BEST shower head I have ever used, and the fact that it is Amazon’s #1 best seller speaks for itself.First things first, this is a BIG shower head (five inches across) and the saucer extension around the perimeter makes it seem even larger. But size actually DOES matter. The internal impeller which makes the center massaging mechanism function is large and robust. That’s why the massaging action actually works and doesn’t just pulse the water stream like the wimpy old Pollenex design.The rain shower setting is better than any rain shower you have ever used. It’s like being in an Amazon rain forest except the water can be warm. And the 360 setting knob means that you can move from one setting to the next without ever getting to the last setting and being forced to go back. However, in order to make the thing actually function properly, it is necessary to defeat the internal flow restrictor/limiter.If you mount this shower head right out of the box, it will rate 7 out of a possible 10. Pretty good really, and still the best shower head I have ever used, but not quite a life changer. However, once the flow restrictor is defeated, it’s a solid 10 (maybe 11). You choose. The restrictor limits flow to 2.5 gpm. Without it, you can expect closer to 4 gpm with most city water.Here’s how it’s done.First, examine the threaded end of the 2005. Inside, you’ll see a convex debris screen with an integrated black rubber washer. The washer ensures a tight seal to the pipe and the screen filters larger debris before it can enter the showerhead. Remove this and set aside. Tweezers work well.Now you can see the real culprit. The restrictor is white plastic with spokes connecting the inner hub to the outer radius. If you look carefully, you’ll also note four white plastic tabs placed like compass points. Of course, it’s tempting to think that a firm grasp on these tabs will allow easy removal of the offending restrictor, but no such luck. Use your needle nose pliers, get a firm grip on a tab and prove it for yourself. The restrictor won’t budge, but you can break off the plastic tabs (no help). The tabs are for assembly only and they are no help when attempting removal. Nope, this fix requires power tools. So get out your hand drill and a ¼ inch bit … EXACTLY ¼ inch bit. And drill out that sucker. The ¼ inch bit is self centering (like they WANT you to do this) and since the restrictor is plastic, use a slow speed. But if you’re careful, then within a minute or so there will be nothing but white plastic shards remaining, and the restrictor will be no more.Now turn the 2005 over and tap it lightly on a towel. Use your tweezers, whatever, just get out all the plastic shards otherwise they will find their way inside the 2005 and that would be wrong.Reassembly is a cinch. Just replace the debris screen and gasket (remember that the screen should be convex, not concave) and press it into place without damaging the screen or the gasket.Now wrap some teflon thread tape on the pipe coming out of the wall, (believe it or not, they actually include some in the box). Install the 2005 (righty tighty) and enjoy a well earned shower.This is a DIY project you will thank yourself for every morning of your life. A high quality shower head like the 2005 should last at least a decade. So at $30 and over 3000 days … what’s that? … one penny per day? for a shower that will change your life? Just get this thing.</p>
