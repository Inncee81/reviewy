<h5 id="very-good-sound-bar">Very good sound bar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good sound bar. Before I bought it went to the store and listen to the sound (in the store 2 times more expensive). Good stuff, nice appearance and most importantly good sound (Bass and Treble and Subwoofer power - easily adjustable with the remote)I am very satisfiedmore about the technical specifications can be found here - [&hellip;]</p>

<h5 id="i-can-hear-the-tv-now">I can hear the tv now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this sound bar to match my LG tv with downward facing speakers it was hard to hear the television. This sound bar makes a huge difference. You can definitely crank the volume with this unit. The neighbors say you can hear it out in the road. Not the same sound as surround sound but nice not to have wires running all over the place.</p>

<h5 id="this-lg-sound-bar-because-i-recently-bought-a-smart-lg-50-tv">&hellip; this LG sound bar because I recently bought a smart LG 50&rdquo; TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this LG sound bar because I recently bought a smart LG 50&rdquo; TV. Knowing the setup and sync would be compatible. I was seriously thinking of buying the Yamaha model soundbar ($399.00 plus tax,) for I know they have excellent sound products. After going online and comparing pricing and sound quality I found the LG SH5B 2.1 system. LG was priced much lower than other top line sound systems. purchased this, got it and am very pleased with the unit. It added much needed volume for movies and music through the TV. Now if your a person from the 70&rsquo;s its going to blow the windows out, but for the price its a great upgrade for your TV. The brackets to hang this unit to your TV did not accomadate my TV. You will have to research your TV to the soundbar mount for exact fit. It can easily be mounted on a wall for clean look. wireless Subwoofer more than adequate. Very easy sound menu with minimum settings. Synced to my TV remote with 1 click. I listen to a lot of DVR music and needed some power. enhanced movie sound a lot. Very pleased with price and quality. Great job LG&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-design-and-value-for-a-2-1-soundbar">Great sound, design and value for a 2.1 soundbar.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mated to a new 65&rdquo; LG 65UH7700 4K TV in a 22x 13Ft living room. We used a slim cabinet and as such our Receiver and PSB 5.1 setup prior was removed (as per wife&rsquo;s wishes!) and we needed something more streamlined and less equipment in your face dominating the room&rsquo;s decor.Listened to many 2.1 models under the $350 range like the Vizio SB3821, Yamaha YAS105, Sony HTC180 and Samsung 4000 series and I kept coming back to the LG.So this review and details are based on the integration between the 2 LG products:+Soundbar is slim and of great construction, looks nice in front of the 65UH7700. Smil enough to wedge securely between bottom frame of the TV and the stand.+Wireless subwoofer is small. So small its about as tall as the average 5.25&rdquo; Bookshelf monitor yet slimmer. This allowed easy placement in the storage cube organizer shelf below the television so i started there instead of having to bury it somewhere else in the room. While small it has great impact in the tight 45-100hz area, and you can achieve deeper low end my manipulating its positioning. In my case the further i pushed it back with the port firing against the wall, the louder and &lsquo;larger&rsquo; it sounded.+Connectivity with LG TV was seamless. Under Sound Out Menu on TV, you can scan for device and it will automatically pick it up Bluetooth with no direct wire connection to the TV. I was pleasantly surprised to find the audio mix was accurate and didn&rsquo;t appear to have any delay from the video on screen. I still opted for the optical cable for the Dolby/DTS decoding from my sources. My experience with the output set to TV Speakers + Sound Bar&hellip;was audio was not sync&rsquo;d&rsquo;leveled properly, i would recommend against that and only output to the SH5B.+ Magic Remote controls the soundbar directly, but audio functions such as Sound Mode : APS (power Saving) , Standard, and Cinema (Surround), Midnight(cuts sub off) &hellip;.as well as having control of the Woofer, Treble and Bass in -5 to + 5, in 1 steps&hellip;needs to be done with the included remote.+Magic Remote turns the sound bar off/on when you shut off the television, in sync. Love that simplicity.+Bluetooth connectivity with my Samsung Note 5 worked flawlessly, outputting sound from all my app/sources tested. Requires no Pin.-Main con is wishing it offered a few more sound modes (perhaps Game, simulated 7.1, etc&hellip;) but perhaps those are better features for the pricier models that come with surround speakers.For the price i paid of $192, i&rsquo;m satisfied with the SH5B and its sound quality for its intended use. In the future i would like to pick up a Sonos Playbar and Sub and moving this to another TV, but IMHO for most people looking for a simple setup with a low profile sub that sounds good&hellip;.there is little point in spending more than the SB5H unless the goal is Sonos Sound. Nothing below comes close IMO , so why pay a premium for something in between?This room is the communal room: some news and cartoons, video games, sports and award shows, Youtube music/Netflix and some occasional Blurays. We do our main movie watching in a projector room with 7.1, so the SB5H covers our day to day audio needs just fine.In my honest opinion this is not a surround sound replacement for a separates lover or a movie audio buff as your sound stage never leaves from in front of you , there is no advanced audio decoding and the spatial quality is not quite there for rear sound effects, but perhaps at the 20ft distance of the farthest seating position in MY room, those things dont travel that far back in surround mode. It is however very much up to the task of some balanced sound with great treble, improved speech intelligibility, wider soundstage and bass for a small to medium sized room, and a miles ahead increase over the OEM speakers. This little setup is plenty loud as well. Some reviews claimed it wasn&rsquo;t but it could be source dependent: ie. some channels or programs (you wont make a baseball game scream 100db&rsquo;s) on TV. Watching a surround mode movie or music video on Youtube its very loud enough at 45-50%, and hell the wife has complained to lowering the volume at 30%&hellip;so depends on what you are listening to.The SB5H was a good buy for my money.</p>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great Purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Phenomenal sound quality when synced with an LG UHD TV. Wireless subwoofer links itself just plug and play. FiOS remote can control TV and sound at. Easy setup.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-but-has-its-issues">Great sound, but has its issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had this a week and it does produce a good sound, but the sound sometimes fades in and out on the &ldquo;cinema&rdquo; setting. Which of course is the best sounding setting. I&rsquo;m gonna give this sound bar a chance.</p>

<h5 id="unreliable-sound">Unreliable sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound - when it works. On SEVERAL occadions the audio in the background (i.e. music) comes through but you can&rsquo;t hear anyone talking. I recorded a movie and the dialogue cut out 20 min into it so I dod&rsquo;t get to finish it.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-for-the-money">Great value for the money</h5>

<p>great speaker for a small apartment. the sound-bar itself is great with voices coming through clearly with mediocre separation of highs and mids.</p>
