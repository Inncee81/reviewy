<p>Superb Zoom for Spectacular Range
18x Optical Zoom
The powerful 18x Optical Zoom range (35mm equivalent: 25–450mm) on the PowerShot SX600 HS is ideal for capturing memories of kids&rsquo; achievements on the sporting field, recitals, plays and concerts – all those times when your access to the action is limited.

<p>Rethink Photography with Creative Shot
Creative Shot mode
In addition to the versatile power of its amazing 18x Optical Zoom, the PowerShot SX600 HS also turns out impressive artistic photos with Creative Shot mode. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.</p>

<p>Beautiful Images and Incredible Performance Start Here
16.0 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor
The PowerShot SX600 HS camera&rsquo;s 16.0 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor is the highest resolution CMOS sensor used in any PowerShot camera. The difference this makes in your everyday photography is remarkable. The large sensor takes in more light, so images are clear and beautifully detailed. High ISO shots are particularly impressive, with less noise and expanded dynamic range. And the 16.0 Megapixel resolution gives you the flexibility to be more creative with your shots: crop and enlarge any part of an image – you can be confident that the detail and resolution you need are there.</p>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The new Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot SX600 HS camera&rsquo;s advanced functions and capabilities, including Hybrid Auto, Creative Shot, and Full HD video shooting at 30p in the easy-to-share MP4 format. Its accelerated processing speed creates fast, responsive performance, for a shooting experience that&rsquo;s easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations, and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system compensates for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur, and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The result is images that are reliably sharp and clear at all lengths of the camera&rsquo;s powerful zoom. The processor&rsquo;s highly efficient design also extends battery life.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM helps provide excellent low-light performance
The slim, compact PowerShot SX600 HS gives you the power to capture beautifully detailed, naturally lit images even in low light – reducing the need for flash and the occasionally unwelcome effects it produces. That&rsquo;s because the camera&rsquo;s 16.0 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works with the camera&rsquo;s new DIGIC 4+ Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM, specifically engineered for spectacular low-light performance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you&rsquo;ll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at ISO speeds up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.</p>

<p>Get the Complete HD Experience
Capture stunning 1080p Full HD video with a dedicated movie button
The PowerShot SX600 HS not only preserves your special video memories with spectacular realism, but does it in a format that makes them easy to share. You can simply press the dedicated movie button to start and stop video recording, so you&rsquo;re always ready to capture the moment as it happens. The camera records in stunningly realistic 1080p Full HD, so even when played back on a big-screen HDTV, your videos are crystal clear, with smooth action and beautifully natural color. Thanks to the advanced DIGIC 4+ Image Processor, video can be captured at 30 frames per second in MP4 format. MP4 videos are perfectly sized for quick online sharing – whether you&rsquo;re showing relatives what the kids are up to or posting status updates on social networking sites.</p>

<p>Share with a Single Touch
Mobile Device Connect Button
It&rsquo;s now easier than ever to connect your PowerShot SX600 HS camera to an iOS® or Android™ device* using the Mobile Device Connect Button. The button allows you to choose to transfer images to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing with the CameraWindow app**, or to your computer on the same network with Image Sync to make saving and organizing your images easier. Once your device is registered on the camera, simply press the Mobile Device Connect button for easy connection.</p>

<p>By connecting to a smartphone with the CameraWindow app using the Mobile Device Connect Button, you can browse and share images while still leaving the camera inside a bag.

Once your camera is linked to your computer on the same wireless network, you can automatically transfer images to it, for easy saving and organizing of your photos.

<p>Remember the Day in Crisp HD
Hybrid Auto
The PowerShot SX600 HS camera features Hybrid Auto, which records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, or any time you&rsquo;re shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this “highlight reel” is stunningly beautiful. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos
Smart AUTO
Sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button, Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. On the PowerShot SX600 HS, detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you&rsquo;re shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX600 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether youâ€™re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
ECO Mode
The PowerShot SX600 HS features ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. The mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi® featured on the camera. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.</p>

<p>Easily Print Your Favorite Moments
It&rsquo;s quick and easy to make beautiful prints from your PowerShot camera. With the built-in Wi-Fi® on your PowerShot camera, it&rsquo;s easy to send your images to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) compatible printer. Or use the Direct Print system; simply connect your PowerShot SX600 HS camera to a Canon PIXMA or SELPHY photo printer with a USB cable and press the button to print.

<blockquote>
<p>I have several other Canon digital cameras, and slowly retire old ones to replace them with new ones, all the while keeping three or four of them active. I like the consistency of Canon&rsquo;s user interface, since let&rsquo;s face it&hellip;..many digital camera have user interfaces that you will forget how to use if the manual is not handy.I have one of the ELPH series, which is a gorgeously nice looking camera that is both small and light weight, and it takes nice pictures. But it is reluctant to focus properly in many situations, and is fond of taking photos that look OK on the LCD screen but are actually a bit soft in focus. It also will not adjust focus or exposure during the taking of videos. So, nice but still lacking in some ways.Then I have a big S3IS which I love, but it is growing a bit long in the tooth in terms of its small LCD screen size and relatively low resolution. However, it excels are being able to take still photos while in the process of also taking videos, something I find very useful, and its ability to freeze action during sports or other &lsquo;active&rsquo; scenes surpasses any other camera that I currently own.Then there is one PowerShot that I bought a year ago because it takes two AA cells for its battery, as opposed to requiring a proprietary Canon battery, but I see Canon has discontinued that camera line.So I was looking for a replacement for the ELPH in my lineup&hellip;..a basic point-and-shoot with good specs, pocketable size, strong optical zoom, and ability to take camcorder-quality videos including auto adjustment of focus and exposure as the subject of the video changes. The choice came down to the PowerShot SX600 HS and it&rsquo;s mate the SX700 HS, a price difference of about $100. The major differences are that the SX700 has a better image processor and a much stronger optical zoom (30x instead of 18x). After discussing my needs with a Canon product specialist (and Canon remains excellent for how easy they make it to reach real people for getting questions answered, and these people are not in a foreign call center reading from a script), I decided on the SX600.After taking a few photos around the house to make sure it worked, I took it along as a backup to my S3IS camera on a recent vacation trip. Now that I am back from the trip, I have to confess that I never pulled the S3IS out of the bag, and did all stills and videos using the SX600.The SX600 is a typical size for its class, measuring 4&rdquo; wide, 2.4&rdquo; tall, and 1&rdquo; deep front to rear (not counting the zoom lens which sticks out quite a ways when the camera is turned on). This is a comfortable pocket size, but the weight of about 6 oz is noticeable and I would not call it exactly light weight. The camera feels substantial and sturdy.Even though the SX600 uses a typical proprietary flat Canon rechargeable battery, the camera case sports a small bulge in front to help you keep a good grip on it while shooting with only one hand. I found that this bulge was useful, but still just a bit too small to really afford a secure one-handed grip. Still, I applaud Canon for providing anything to help in this regard. The camera case is all plastic; mine is the black finish and it is a simple matte plastic texture. The other color options appear to provide different textures, but I cannot comment further on that.The front of the SX600 is dominated by the large lens assembly; this is a generously large optical device for a small point-and-shoot, and it is one of the main selling points for the camera. In order to get the lens &lsquo;unpacked&rsquo; for use, the internal motorized mechanism has to go through a series of maneuvers, but this is automatic and quick so you hardly notice it. The same applies to stowing the lens when you turn the power off. The automatic lens cover works very well.The rear of the SX600 is taken up with the large 3&rdquo; diagonal wide-viewing-angle color LCD display and the set of buttons and selections. I will not go into detail of the user interface since the SX600 shares the conventional and well established Canon philosophy and controls layout. The only part of this that I found to be different from my other Canon&rsquo;s is the addition of a three-position slide switch that allows changing from normal AUTO picture taking mode to either of two specialty modes. The most notable of these modes is the so-called &ldquo;Creative Shot&rdquo; mode, where immediately after you take the intended still photo, the camera automatically takes several more of the same subject in quick succession, each with different &lsquo;special effects&rsquo; settings applied. I found this to be a totally useless feature for anything like normal camera use&hellip;.not sure who would be likely to appreciate this feature.I like the pop-up flash. If you push it down, the flash will not fire regardless of the settings, and if you think you might want to have the flash work, you press the button that allows it to pop up, and it will then fire automatically as needed. I much prefer this to having to go into a menu somewhere to turn the flash on and off.The image sensor is 16 megapixels, which is very good in this price range. You will not even notice this for most normal photos, but if you zoom in to the limits of the optical zoom and then keep zooming in, the extra resolution will help prevent the image from getting grainy.While the SX600 is both a camcorder and a still camera in a single case, it does have some limitations as described below.STILL:- You cannot shoot still photos while the camera is taking a video. However, pressing the shutter button (as if to take a still photo) will immediately stop the video and pressing the shutter a second time will take the still photo. Then press the red VIDEO button again to immediately resume shooting the video, and hopefully you only lost a couple seconds.- Not as many ways to fine tune the resolution and JPEG compression settings to use for still photos, when compared to my other Canon cameras&hellip;..this camera will always take larger sized image files than what I desire for most casual photography.VIDEO:- Focus adjusts on the fly as you pan around while shooting videos, but exposure adjustments seem to be sluggish in response (compared to the quick way the camera is able to automatically adjust otherwise).- The SX600 has effective image stabilization for still photos while zoomed in, but it seemed to me that the image stabilization did not work very well while shooting videos (and maybe the camera does not even have this feature&hellip;.the manual was not too clear about it).- Full zoom is possible during videos.- Unlike still photos, it seems there is no adjustment to how the videos are taken. The aspect ratio and resolution appear to be fixed as 1080p (1920 x 1280) full HD widescreen.- Unlike still photo mode, where I never experienced a failure to focus perfectly, I encountered many times (but still a small percentage of videos I took on my vacation) when the camera simply refused to focus after I pressed the red VIDEO button. I needed to stop the video, tap the shutter button to &lsquo;wake up&rsquo; the auto focus system, then press the red VIDEO button again to restart the video. No good reason that I can think of for this to happen.- Unlike a real camcorder, the SX600 automatically creates new video files every few minutes, as opposed to making a single huge video file if you keep on recording without a break. If you edit the separate files together on to a DVD or something like that, it appears that nothing is lost. But it can be alarming to look at the video status on the display when you have been recording a video for maybe 12 minutes, and the counter shows only 2 minutes and 5 seconds, for example (because it already closed off the first 10 minutes as a separate video file).As with all Canon cameras, you cannot recharge the battery while it is in the camera. You must pull it out and place it in the included charger. I got very long times out of the battery, lots of time with the display on and zooming going on, etc; Still, I recommend buying a second battery in case the first one runs out of power in the middle of something important. It takes a few hours to recharge each battery but I found that one charger could easily charge two batteries overnight (if I set an alarm to wake up and change the battery at 2 AM). Based on my experience, don&rsquo;t waste your time with generic or third-party batteries&hellip;.just plop down the money for the real Canon battery if you want the same kind of battery life that the included one gives you.The SX600 has Wi-Fi, and you can use this to send photos and videos to your smart phone or to Wi-Fi equipped printers, computers, etc. However, I have not used the Wi-Fi feature and cannot comment on it. One cute aspect of the Wi-Fi is that you can apparently use your smart phone to remotely trigger the camera to take a photo; useful for group shots and so on.The SX600 is fairly basic in terms of special features and being able to shoot in unusual situations. It is primarily a basic point-and-shoot. However, you can get some access to basic manual controls if you are so inclined to use them.Based on my experience so far, filling up six SD cards of 8 GB each on my vacation (lots of than being video), I have few real complaints with the SX600, and it has become my main camera for everyday and vacation photography and video.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a Canon compact zoom camera. I had before compact point and shoots with 5x zoom max, which satisfied me, but at some point you start missing a good zoom at nature shots. So I decided to give it a try. Its 18x zoom with 4.5 to 81mm lens is great, which is said to be 25-450mm according to 35mm film specs - just amazing, not many DSLR camera lens have these specs - eventually you will end up with those huge lens hangin all around your neck costin you 2K or even more and feeling like a weightlifter. BTW this model is similar to cheaper model 280sx with a bit deeper zoom.After a short play I was pleasantly surprised with zoom lens - I shot everything and at any distance. The camera also has Canon&rsquo;s Hybrid Auto mode, which captures a few seconds of video before each picture you take. At the end of a day, the camera automatically gathers up all clips and photos and puts them into a movie, which is really funny.Still the only one con (-1 star) which matters to me is the matrix size. The resulting picture in really low light conditions is a bit more noisy (IMHO this is actually the difference between small and large matrices, not all though) than with larger matrix that needs a larger budget. After all, every budget camera today is supplied with small <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3 CCD.Pros:1. 16.0 Megapixels, with loads of resolution pictures are still clear at big zooms. High resolution is also good for producing bigger printouts.2. 18x Optical Zoom is cool.3. DIGIC 4+ Image Processor. Mighty enough to give you advanced system options, provide quick-shoot with low battery consumption. Must be quicker than DIGIC 4, which is currently Canon&rsquo;s efficient processor for budget cameras.4. Very lightweight, just put it into your pocket, and take it everywhere.5. Full HD video with video snapshots called Hybrid Auto is a new feature that I like.Cons:1. Still <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; sensor - entry level CCD providing standard pictures, not of a DSLR quality though.2. No Aperture priority or shutter priority mode, which might be a good feature while shooting nature.Summary:I definitely love the camera. Current price $249 - about right taking into account its competitors. If you&rsquo;re looking for a &ldquo;medium budget&rdquo; compact zoom camera taking family photos and events, and especially nature requiring zoom, this is a good choice and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
