<h5 id="no-electricity-no-problem">No electricity? No problem!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a little hesitant to get this air pump simply because I didn&rsquo;t know if it could handle pumping up our extra large queen mattress as well as two twins running on battery. Our mattresses are the kind that have the built-in air pump, but you need to have electricity to plug them in (obviously), and we were camping at a site that not only didn&rsquo;t have electricity, but we had to carry our gear to the site after parking our car (too) far away, unable to utilize the A/C receptacle our cars are fortunate to have.The only gripe I have is the attachments that come with this - there are three different size nozzles to choose from - none of which fit the mattress plug to keep the air going into the mattress vs. leaking out all around the nozzle. So it took a little patience (and holding the nozzle and air pump firm, blocking the leakage with my hands) to get the air in, but it did ultimately work. The size configuration of the nozzle adapters is the only thing that knocks one star off this air pump.I was worried about battery power lasting, and it certainly does - in fact, the batteries still had plenty of power to fill up the kids&rsquo; mattresses to do a camp out in the backyard a week or so later - and that was after we borrowed the batteries for a battery powered lantern we used throughout the weekend, since we forgot to buy enough batteries for both.Word to the wise, though - if you have long hair, make sure you hold this thing away from you, or it will try to eat your hair where the intake fan is. Ahem.</p>

<h5 id="easy-pump">Easy Pump</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great portable battery operated pump. It doesn&rsquo;t need cords or your car cigarette lighter to work. My mattress was ready for company in very little time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-very-handy-little-pump-for-small-air-mattresses">A very handy little pump for small air mattresses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use and only takes 3 or 4 minutes to blow up a small mattress. Really helps when you have several mattresses to blow up. Sure beats having to do it by mouth. This pump also deflates the mattresses as well. One of the things I like about this pump is that the adapter nozzles are attached to the pump so they won&rsquo;t get lost or misplaced. Operates on 4 D cell batteries so I just swap the batteries from my Mag-Lite to my pump or lantern. That way I only need 4 batteries instead of 12.I really like it and would highly recommend it over the Coleman. Coghlan&rsquo;s air pump is not only cheaper but has better user reviews.</p>

<h5 id="great-universal-air-pump">Great universal air pump.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great air pump. We use it mostly while camping. It blows up the air mattress, our water floats, etc. It also vacuums the air back out so that you can fold them back up the way they came and fit them back into their box. The batteries usually last a season.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have">A must have!!!!!</h5>

Our mattresses are the kind that have the built-in air pump, but you need to have electricity to plug them in (obviously), and we were camping at a site that not only didn&rsquo;t have electricity, but we had to carry our gear to the site after parking our car (too) far away, unable to utilize the A/C receptacle our cars are fortunate to have.Another great advantage to this is for all of the blow up toys for the kids. We have a large inflatable pool and a slide to go with it. I was concerned that it might take too long to inflate and kids would go crazy while I was blowing it up. To my surprise, this machine worked very well. I was able to blow up the pool in less than 5 minutes. However, it did not work as well with the smaller attachments.The only gripe I have is the attachments that come with this - there are three different size nozzles to choose from - none of which fit the mattress plug to keep the air going into the mattress vs. leaking out all around the nozzle.

<h5 id="2-pumps-and-still-no-luck">2 pumps and still no luck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate that I have to give it 1 star. It deserves zero. I purchased this product right before my camping trip. I go to turn the pump on and it wouldnt turn on. So I switched the batteries. Same thing happens! I return home. put in the request to return it and the next day I receive a new pump&hellip;. Guess what!!! It doesnt work either! Two pumps and they both don&rsquo;t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-air-mattress-inflator">Great air mattress inflator!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to use on a 3 week road trip so it got a lot of use in a short amount of time. It worked great! Never had an issue and didn&rsquo;t have to change out the batteries during the trip. I am very happy with the product. It fills up a queen size mattress quickly and is not overly loud. Great product for the price!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk-do-not-buy">Junk, do not buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When it first came i put batteries in it. All four of the batteries were almost fully charged. I started to pump up my air mattress but it didn&rsquo;t even get half way done inflating before the pump shut off and would not turn back on. I took the batteries out and tested them and they were at half strength. I then went and purchased four brand new batteries. I put them in the pump and when i went to turn it on, it did not work. I didn&rsquo;t even get one use out of this pump. Do not buy</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-not-recommend-this-to-any-one">I would not recommend this to any one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A low powered noisy personal fan &ndash; not an air pump. This &ldquo;pump&rdquo; made no change in size at all to our totally flat, brand new River Rats.</p>
