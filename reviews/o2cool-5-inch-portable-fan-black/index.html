<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="super-quiet-but-not-as-powerful-as-other-small-fans">Super quiet, but not as powerful as other small fans</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised that this fan doesn&rsquo;t put out more wind on the highest settings, especially considering it uses 2 huge D batteries. On the low setting you can barely feel it. I have a 3&rdquo; and a 4&rdquo; fan that puts out a much stronger breeze. BUT, this one is very quiet. See my photos to see how far this one blows the scarf, compared to another I have (but it IS much louder).So if you are looking for a small QUIET fan, with a decent breeze, this is a good choice. But don&rsquo;t expect to feel the breeze further than your arm&rsquo;s length away. So it is good for working on my computer/desk.</p>

<h5 id="fan-comparison">FAN COMPARISON</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 2 fans to see which one I would like better. I needed something light and portable to carry with me. I bought these 2 fans.OPOLAR Portable Rechargeable Fanhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZYUL6A/ref=cfb_at_prodpgO2COOL 5-Inch Portable Fanhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AVMSEY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0After receiving them the first thing I noticed was the weight which was a big Factor for me as I’m disabled and carrying heavy items doesn’t work well with me. The OPOLAR is much lighter. I still haven’t even put in the batteries yet. So, I opened the boxes and to my surprise the OPOLAR again came with a battery that was light weight. The O2COOL required 2 heavy D batteries. Another Negative for the O2COOL. Not that I have many things that use D batteries I had to have someone go pick me up some. So anyways I got the batteries later that night and begin the Fan test. So, I was checking the power of these 2 fans and to my surprise the much lighter and smaller OPOLAR literally blew the O2COOL away. Now the O2COOL only has a 2-speed motor and the OPOLAR has a 3-speed motor. But even on the second speed the OPOLAR is much stronger and much lighter the winner of these 2 small fans in my opinion is the OPOLAR by far. The OPOLAR is also lighted by a pretty nice blue led. And also has a pretty strong led flashlight on it as well.OPOLAR Portable Rechargeable Fan, Mini USB Fan with Upgraded 2200mAh LG Battery, Personal Cooling for Traveling Hiking Fishing Camping or Desktop, 3 Speeds, with LED Light</p>

<h5 id="great-as-baby-beach-fan">Great as baby beach fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These fans are awesome - great value for the price. We bought two for our beach vacation to use in a beach tent with our 4 month old. They worked perfectly. I even bought tons of extra D batteries because I planned run the fans the whole time we were down on the beach. I did run them the whole time we were out for 5 days, and I never had to replace the batteries. Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="good-little-fan-hacked-to-use-a-usb-cable-for-power">Good little fan, hacked to use a usb cable for power.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was able to hack this good little fan and connect a USB cable for power. Now I use a rechargeable lithium ion battery pack, hours and hours of powers. I use it for my tent while camping. Much better than using expensive and wasteful D batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fan-portion-is-5-inches-whole-unit-is-larger-than-that">Fan portion is 5 inches. Whole unit is larger than that.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bet as a desk fan, this would work fine. I bought it to bring with me backpacking to keep in our tent for some air movement and some ambient noise. However, when it says 5 inch fan, it means the fan portion is 5 inches, NOT the entire unit, which is what I thought when I ordered it. It is closer to 9 inches across, which makes it too large for me to carry with me backpacking. I am returning the unit because it is too big for my needs. I wanted to made sure I left a review so that other people will know that it&rsquo;s just the fan portion that is 5 inches.</p>

<h5 id="obnoxiously-difficult-to-open">OBNOXIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO OPEN</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT 5/2/17: I finally gave up and bought a plug-in fan. What a relief! My hands just couldn&rsquo;t take the beating with every battery change&ndash;and it was needing fresh batteries constantly. It&rsquo;s a cute little fan but geez! Save your sanity. Get something else.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;It is testimony to the fan&rsquo;s otherwise greatness that I am giving it FOUR STARS, because the battery compartment is an absolute MONSTER to open. In all my 52 years I have never encountered such a bloody bear of a thing. I actually <em>injured</em> my finger trying to prise the acursed door to the compartment open. The screw was not screwed into anything; it spun round and round uselessly until I finally stuck a regular screwdriver in between the fan&rsquo;s case and the battery compartment door and saw what was going on. It was then I realized I&rsquo;d have to bust it open, using the screwdriver for leverage; but even then the dastardly thing held fast. Finally, I tried wedging a metal file into the opening and pulled it and the screwdriver in opposite directions. This did the trick, and the fan itself blows plenty of cool air at me just exactly as I hoped it would.I&rsquo;m very happy w/ its size and stability on my table top. I&rsquo;m happy as can be with the amount of cooling air it moves. But it was almost&ndash;not quite but almost&ndash;not worth it. Needless to say I won&rsquo;t be putting the battery compartment door back on. EDIT: As you might expect, it is also a Herculean task to get the dead batteries OUT&ndash;which sucks because the dang thing is a battery hog. If the amazon algorithm will let me, I&rsquo;m taking this frustrating thing down to three stars.</p>

<h5 id="and-they-were-great-somehow">and they were great! ) Somehow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave this product three stars. These work okay, but I found that the batteries, for me, were hard to put in place. I used to have two older models that finally went kaput, so I bought two new ones to replace those older ones. (The fans really lasted&ndash;I had had them for YEARS, and they were great!) Somehow, replacing the batteries now requires placement of a tiny screw and a Phillips screwdriver, which I don&rsquo;t always carry with me! I like the light weight of these fans, but because of the more difficult replacement of the batteries, I could only give the product three stars.</p>
