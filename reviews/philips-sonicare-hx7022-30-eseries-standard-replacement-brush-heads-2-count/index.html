You can&rsquo;t see it, but your brush head wears over time. Blue reminder bristles fade in color to let you know when it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Dental professionals recommend replacing your brush head every three months. Sonicare technology helps you remove up to two times more plaque compared to a manual toothbrush.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="buy-the-real-thing">Buy the real thing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE my Sonicare - nothing compares to how clean my teeth feel after every brushing other than the dentist. I highly recommend one to everyone I know. It was the best money I&rsquo;ve spent in a long time. My mouth feels cleaner, longer. My teeth have since whitened&hellip; But on to the review of this product:I originally had purchased the sonicare replacement brush heads, but I felt they were pretty pricey, so I purchased some Wal-Mart special replacement heads. Worst idea EVER. The wal-mart special replacements are loud, not even close to the same quality, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I would get the same clean from just using it manually. I am not even ready to replace my wal-mart heads, and have already bought these, which compared to local prices, is much gentler on the wallet!Conclusion: Buy the real thing, spend the money on the sonicare heads, unless you want to hate your brush. It&rsquo;s not worth the savings, from Wal-mart or wherever, because you&rsquo;ll just be here, buying the real thing.</p>

<h5 id="bristles-falling-out-and-this-is-the-second-set-doing-this">Bristles falling out and this is the second set doing this!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I need help from the company. This is the second set (we get them every 3 months) that the bristles begin falling out as you are brushing your teeth. It starts within the first few days of using them. It is only a bristle or 2 at a time but it is not good. It gagged me this week. It is happening to both replacement heads on mine and my husbands. We have never had this problem before but the set before this and the current one are doing this. I need them replaced. I would also like to know why this is happening all of a sudden. Once I hear from the company and get resolution, I will update my review. Thank you.Update: I have not heard from the company. I need this resolved by them!!</p>

<h5 id="defective-right-out-of-the-box">Defective right out of the box!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although it appears to be packaged in original Philips Sonicare packaging, I am afraid that the product may be a knock-off. I have been using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for at least 15 years. We have never gotten a defective replacement brush until we ordered this one. One of the brushes seems to work just fine, but the other just barely vibrates. I might as well be using an ordinary toothbrush. I compared the two brushes and the defective one seems to be missing a magnet at the bottom of the brackets that go inside the housing. I will not be buying any more of these from Amazon. I really am disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrible-product-from-this-manufacturer">Terrible product from this manufacturer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One bristle fell out with my first use. Another one the next day, another one the next day, etc. I haven&rsquo;t had this problem when I have bought the same product through Kohl&rsquo;s, so I don&rsquo;t know where these are coming from. Did the manufacturer start using a plant in another country? Next time, which should be very soon since bristles keep falling out, I will buy these from Kohl&rsquo;s or another local store so I can easily return them if they fall apart. I am too busy to figure out how to return them to amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-when-they-work">great product when they work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is a counterfeiting or quality control issue, but the last couple of packages of these I&rsquo;ve bought have had some bum heads in them. When I put them on my base, they&rsquo;ll vibrate but the head doesn&rsquo;t swivel, so they&rsquo;re totally useless. I tested them on my husband&rsquo;s base as well so I know it&rsquo;s not just me.When I buy these, I take them out of the packaging and store them in my pantry until I&rsquo;m ready for a new one. Last time I went to switch out I had 3 or 4 in storage, so I&rsquo;m not sure who I bought them from or which shipment they came in. I did notice that some had &ldquo;philips e-series&rdquo; stamped on the stem and others didn&rsquo;t; the non-functioning ones also seemed not to stand up exactly straight, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell just by eyeballing.I can&rsquo;t buy the compact heads from any of my local retailers, so I&rsquo;m stuck buying them online. Next time around, I will buy from amazon (the seller)so I know they&rsquo;re won&rsquo;t be problems returning should I need to, and test both heads before tossing the packaging should they need to go back.I gave these 5 stars because I vastly prefer the compact head. Yes, it is the size of a child&rsquo;s toothbrush, which enables me to get the backside of my front teeth, and the small head hugs every little crevice and curve of my teeth, making for a much for thorough clean. A larger head is fine for a manual toothbrush but not great for a sonicare since you can&rsquo;t exactly turn, tip and angle the brush to get it to fit the space you&rsquo;re cleaning. I&rsquo;ve been using these for about 10 years and wish the compact heads were more readily available at B &amp; M retailers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-waste">What a waste&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a waste. These heads break easily, well before the bristles are worn down.What I mean by &ldquo;break&rdquo; is that something happens so that the vibration becomes reduced and ineffective.I had bought the &ldquo;Sonishare&rdquo; generic versions previously, but thought I should spend a little more and go back to the Philips-branded toothbrush heads for a better experience. I was wrong&hellip;there&rsquo;s no difference in performance, and I actually prefer the Sonishare&rsquo;s slightly stiffer bristles.But what I really like about the Sonishare is that they last. I&rsquo;m pretty disappointed (as much a toothbrush head can disappoint) in these Philips versions&hellip;they&rsquo;re just a waste of money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="0-for-3-they-all-broke-within-a-month">0 for 3, They All Broke within a Month.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never had an issue with Sonicare Replacement Heads before, and I may have just received a bad set this time. The 1st head I tried made a loud noise when I turned it on, and didn&rsquo;t vibrate like Sonicare Heads normally do. I thought it may just have been a bad head, so tried another. The second worked for approximately 2 weeks, then the same issue happened. Thinking it may have been the base to my toothbrush, I had my wife use the 3rd and I went and bought a single head off the shelf at the local Target. Her lasted 3 days and had the same issue. Again, this is the 1st time this has ever happened and chances are it may be a manufacturing issue, but to spend this much money on 3 heads that didn&rsquo;t work, is annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of-money">Waste of Money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not notice this was a generic product when purchased.It is noisy, It &ldquo;stutters&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t seem to do the work.a complete waste of money. Had I tried it earlier I would have certainly return it because it is a rip-off</p>
