<h5 id="this-item-would-not-work-with-my-boss-setup">This item would not work with my boss setup, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This item would not work with my boss setup, I have installed multiple sound systems before so I know I was not doing something wrong as I had others check my wiring. Also did not let me return this 2 days after it was bought.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-amplifier-400-watts-4-channels-is-nice-for-a-small-amplification">The amplifier 400 watts 4 channels is nice for a small amplification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The amplifier 400 watts 4 channels is nice for a small amplification, you know if you are looking just for to change your regular series sound, it&rsquo;s perfect. But I recommended to use speakers no more than 50 rms watts if you want a clear sound and no a flip. I tried the 400 watts amplifier for my wife and she is happy with this. But for me I took the 1600 watts 4 channels amplifier, with 100 rms watts speakers and this combination was really perfect, the amplifier is working perfectly, the sound is great, some people waiting bad reviews about this but I think they are using the amplifier incorrectly with the wrong rms watts speakers, I always recommend to use one amplifier 50 % more rms watts that your speakers. Example. If your speakers are 100 rms watts, you must to use an amplifier 150 watts rms by channel.</p>

<h5 id="garbage-don-t-buy-it">Garbage. Don&rsquo;t buy it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother buying this amp. I didn&rsquo;t read the reviews but afterwards i found I had the same exact problem as several other people with a high pitched noise in every channel.It would play audio properly but the noise is always there as long as it&rsquo;s powered up.I was issued a refund but opted not get a new one seeing as so many people had the same problem</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="could-not-get-the-buzz-out-of-this-even-running">Could not get the buzz out of this even running &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Could not get the buzz out of this even running a hard ground to the battery and adding a ground loop isolator to every channel. I&rsquo;m buying a different one for my needs. You get what you pay for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="noise-problem">Noise Problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little amp seemed like it would work just fine after I installed it. Sound wasn&rsquo;t great, but i must admit it was at least as good if not better than expected for the price. Then I turned the ignition on, and the noise was insane! Buzzing, repetitious clicking, whine, etc.. It was the worst I&rsquo;ve ever heard, truly, and i&rsquo;ve owned some pretty cheap amps before. Anyway, I tried a Boss inline 12A power filter. Works great sometimes, but in this case made it worse actually. Then I tried an old in-line RCA filter i had thrown in the electronic scrap box because it didn&rsquo;t work and I couldn&rsquo;t return it. It worked on this amp! This is a Left/Right RCA filter that says &ldquo;20 Amp High Quality Noise Suppressor Isolation Transformer&rdquo; on the outside housing. It didn&rsquo;t work for the application I bought it for (so I got a BSN40 and it did work.) Glad I saved this one though, because it killed every noise the amp was making and sound quality was not compromised. The bass might actually be slightly richer/deeper now on this full frequency range application, but i&rsquo;ll have to find another filter exactly the same for the other 2 channels. I see several sources here that sell what appears to be it, but you never know with generic label stuff like this.So if you have this amp and don&rsquo;t know what to try next, the filter I suggested worked perfect for me, even though 2 of them cost as much as the amp does. :)</p>

<h5 id="simply-put-it-doesn-t-work-properly">Simply put&hellip;&hellip;It doesn&rsquo;t work properly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this amp in order to power 4 JVC speakers which were rated 50 watt RMS per speaker. When the car was in accessory mode everything works fine, but as soon as you put the vehicle in ignition mode or once it&rsquo;s running you hear this unbearable beep sound. The sound is best described by imagining a continuity meter beep. It&rsquo;s extremely annoying and obnoxious. I switched the amp for a $200 Kenwood and the noise was gone and the sound quality was 1000 times better. Avoid yourself the headache and avoid this $30 amp. You literally will get what you pay for.Other reviewers will also state they have had the same issue with this amp.</p>

<h5 id="great-amp">Great amp!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this because I was not happy with my new JVC stereo- it did not have the power my old JVC did. Come to find out the old JVC&rsquo;s have a great pre-amp that the new ones lack. I still have old JVC as I still go back and forth about switching it out- only thing that stops me is new has a usb port in front that I use all the time. I bought the amp to power 4 speakers in my 02 Chevy Silverado 1500 ext cab. I have it powering four Pyramid 250 watt (each) speakers- 2 are 5x8&rsquo;s and 2 are 6x9&rsquo;s. It does a great job of boosting the midrange and highs. I went from having to turn my stereo to 16 to get a decent sound level for driving to only turning it to 3 to get the same level now.I have another Boss amp (1200 watt) hooked to my subwoofer. I will say the subwoofer control is not going to boost your sub&hellip;it will actually cut power to it. It is nice if you have someone in the vehicle that hates a lot of bass, but other than that I leave it unplugged. What some people do not realize is you have to match watts for watts. If you are trying to run 1000 watt amp to power a 800 watt sub- you will not be happy. It will get hot unless you limit the output. I had that issue when changing to a lower watt sub, the amp would get hot and turn off (I thought it was the sub turning off). I had the audio shop make some changes and now all runs cool and the music is great- OK except to the old people who can&rsquo;t stand the thumps and loud music coming from my truck :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;BOSS Audio R4004 Riot 1600-watts Full Range Class A/B 4 Channel 2-8 Ohm Stable Amplifier with Remote Subwoofer Level Control&rdquo;i have only had this for about a month now give or take a couple weekswould give 5 stars but my only porb is that when u bridge for the sub channels it over heats way to fast i mean its stiil great for the price the sound is better then what i did have. the other 2 channels work amazing with the &ldquo;BOSS Audio SK694 Phantom Skull 700-watt 4 way auto 6&rdquo; x 9&rdquo; Coaxial Speaker&rdquo; that i bought with this amp i mean other then the over heating im still pretty happy with this buy</p>
