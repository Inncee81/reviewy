<ul>
<li>Sale is for a SINGLE BAND. Choose 1 of 5 different resistance levels. Not sure which band is right for you? See the second image for our Band Selection Recommendation.</li>
<li>You are looking to purchase this band now: #1 Red - 10 to 35 Pounds <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &ldquo; *4.5mm - With the least amount of resistance, these bands can be employed in stretching, jumping and other light exercises including light weightlifting. They are also perfect for those who only need a slight push for their pull ups.</li>
<li>Here are the details of all the other bands we offer: #1 Red- 10 to 35 Pounds (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &ldquo; *4.5mm), #2 Black - 30 to 60 Pounds (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> &ldquo; *4.5mm), #3 Purple- 40 to 80 Pounds (1.25 &ldquo; *4.5mm), #4 Green - 50 to 125 Pounds (1.75 &ldquo; *4.5mm), #5 Blue - 65 to 175 Pounds (2.5&rdquo; *4.5mm)</li>
<li>Many people buy more than one band and combine the bands for most efficient training. Combining bands gives you 3 levels of assistance - one with the thicker band, one with the thinner band, and one with both bands. This allows you to do sets where you start with the thicker band and then add the thinner band to squeeze out a few additional reps. As your strength gradually increases, you can switch from double bands to the thicker band and then the thinner band alone.</li>

<li><p>Whether you are just starting out with pull ups or you are an athlete working on regaining or enhancing your strength, the WODFitters resistance band will help you take your pull up and chin up training to the next level. Try it for 60 days. If during this time you don&rsquo;t love it or don&rsquo;t feel it was worth every penny of your investment today, we give you your full payment back. No questions asked! We offer a 100% satisfaction Guarantee! New Year New You!</p>

<h5 id="40-year-old-guys-does-2-sets-of-6-chin-ups-for-first-time">&ldquo;40 Year old guys does 2 sets of 6 chin ups for first time&hellip;&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a squat rack that has a pull up bar attached, but as big as I am it&rsquo;s impossible for me to do a single pull up.Based on the positive reviews, I purchased the strongest one (blue), me being a solid 250lbs.What I did was loop it around the top bar and tried it with my knee at first which was pretty hard&hellip;then I nervously put my foot in the loop and stood in it. That was the sweet spot!Not only did it hold me while stretched out&hellip;I was able to do 2 sets of 6 reps of chin ups! &hellip;.Is this not every mans dream since grade school when they humiliate you in front of everyone trying to do the pull up test?I&rsquo;m so excited to be able to add pull ups to my workout routine. It&rsquo;s one of the best exercises on the planet.So, do yourself a favor. Stop reading reviews. Buy the strap you think will work for you&hellip;and then get to work!</p>

<h5 id="love-the-green-band">Love the green band</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it! I got the green band. I am a 5&rsquo; 4&rdquo; female who weighs about 130 pounds, and without it I couldn&rsquo;t do a pull up or chin up on my own. With the green band I am able to do 5 chin ups. I have a doorway mounted chin up bar, so my legs aren&rsquo;t all the way straight. That&rsquo;s no problem though, I bend my knees a little, strap the green band around my knee and do the chin up. It works great. The band helps me do the chin ups, but I&rsquo;m still definitely working hard, it doesn&rsquo;t do the chin up for me (I was sore the next day!). I plan to work my way up to doing about 15 chin ups in a row, then I&rsquo;ll go down to the purple band, then black, then red, then hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to do some unassisted chin ups! I highly recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very nice product! I am 5&rsquo;4, 120 pounds, and have moderate strength. I do weight lifting for toning up, but I am lacking enough strength to do sets of pull ups on my home gym bar. I bought the purple band as the chart said to, and I think it was a good fit. Now I can do pull ups with the right amount of help. There are so many different leg exercises I can do with this band as well. I love it!</p>

<h5 id="good-quality-correct-length">Good quality - correct length?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first set of resistance bands, and I purchased them for the sole purpose of pull up assistance. I purchased both the blue and green bands based on my current weight and the number of pull ups I can currently perform unassisted.The bands came SUPER fast. I am not sure if it&rsquo;s because of Prime or because of the seller, but the bands qualified for free one-day shipping. That was amazing. If that is something the seller setup, I really appreciate that. If it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and give them some praise for it.The bands are really nice. I&rsquo;ve used them a couple of times already and they seem to be high quality bands. I was slightly worried they would take some time to straighten out from being folded and rubber banded, but that didn&rsquo;t happen at all. The bands immediately unfolded and are in perfect condition. Quality (so far) is A+.My ONLY complaint - and I am not even sure if this is valid - is the length of the bands. Like I said, this is my first set of resistance bands so I have nothing to compare against, but these bands do seem kind of short. I am 6&rsquo;1 and I use a pull up station in my apartment complex gym. I attach the band around the pull up bar as instructed in the materials provided by WODFitters and everything else I can find online. Once I have done this, I find it VERY DIFFICULT to get into the band for the pull up assistance. I have to hold my body up in the air and try to get my knee into the band without (1) falling or (2) the band shifting all over the place and preventing me from getting my knee in. One day I tried using both bands and putting one knee in each - yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t happening. And as far as getting my foot into the band? Absolutely not. There is no way that is happening either. I do not know if this is because the pull up station is high, or maybe I am doing something wrong - and I understand that the bands do need to be a little bit short so that you can have the resistance to provide you some assistance. However, these (to me anyways) border on being too short. Do they stretch out? Maybe this will get better over time? I just don&rsquo;t know. Again, this is my first set and maybe all bands are this length - if I try another brand and find the same thing I will update my review because these do seem to be great quality. But, from a beginners eye these do seem short and it does make my workout with them (so far) slightly awkward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I literally used it for 3-4 reps attached to a high bar for abdominal crunches (muay thai crunch) and it began to fray. I received the band yesterday and was looking forward to using this morning and it frayed. I actually don&rsquo;t know what else to say&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="ripped-bands">Ripped bands</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon opening my package I noticed all bands were tied and in and individual bags except the purple. It was out as if it was just tossed in the bag. I would of been ok with that but then I noticed that it had a cut in it. If I even try to use that one, I&rsquo;m sure it would rip. Very displeased in how my order came.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 red, 2 black, 2 purple and 1 green. Had just over a month and after use (not unopened) they all look like they&rsquo;ve aged years (Beat-up &amp; a lot of dis-coloring). I have no proof these had prior owners and were given &lsquo;make up&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s possible. However there is no wearing or deformity, the edges are even and intact, it&rsquo;s just the appearance that makes me suspicious. Used for a lot of leg exercises (squats, hip &amp; leg extensions) as well as the other muscle groups. There is no tension reduction, none of them have any signs of weakness or that I have to baby or eliminate an exercise because it might break. Tried over 50 exercises, used a lot and extremely useful.</p>

<h5 id="must-have-product">MUST HAVE PRODUCT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started my fitness journey. I have never been able to do a pull up, chin up or anything similar. I went online to find ways of how to build myself up to doing them. Luckily I found these bands! I weight 127 lbs and am 5&rsquo;2, I originally purchased the purple 1 going by the chart and it held up very well. My brother who is 5&rsquo;10 and 175 lbs used it and it held up very well. However I didn&rsquo;t take into account that the band wouldn&rsquo;t be enough assistance for me. I then bought the green one and it was just what I needed! If you have zero upper body strength and around my weight I suggest getting the green band!</p>

<p>Why are they so short!!? I can&rsquo;t even get my foot to reach into the loop (and I used to do kung fu!) They must be made for people 5&rsquo;3&rdquo; and under! Totally not workable for me.</p>
