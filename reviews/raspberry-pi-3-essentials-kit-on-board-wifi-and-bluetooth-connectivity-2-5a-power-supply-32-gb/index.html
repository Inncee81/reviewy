<h5 id="i-love-my-rpi3-kit-from-vilros">I love my RPi3 kit from Vilros!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I say about a RPi3 board that others have not said, its an incredible value and a blast to use and learn with. I will go over exactly what I got in this kit and Vilros actually threw in an extra.You get:-RPi3 board-high quality 2.5 A power adapter-great case that is just like the Canakit bundle-a direct number for customer service and support-32gb Evo+ great read/write speeds-MHL HDMI cable-2 aluminum heatsinks-as a bonus that was not stated that was included, I got a usb micro SD card reader, this could have been a mistake, but i will take it!All of the above will get you up and enjoying your RPi3 in a few minutes. As a owner of a RPi2 I love these board and this one has a better GPU clock and is 64 bit which will in time have better software to take advantage of this. Also my Retropie emulation has really been much improved, especially on the Mupen64 (N64) emulator. If you have not tried this mini pc build, its a whole world of fun and learning. As a plus, you can ditch overpaying for a mini Nes and just buy your kid one of these and let him play all Nes titles plus learn Linux and beginner coding to boot. The ultimate reason to choose a Vilros kit is that the Canakit has a bad case design on the 2016 version and can cause your RPi3 board to be damaged when it is installed. This Vilros case is perfect and i experience no overheating while emulating in Retropie. Either way, if you choose a bundle like this over purchasing each seperate piece your going to save money. When I got this kit it was 64.99 which is a great value as individually to get the same things I would have spent nearly 80 bucks. I did not go really to far in-depth, but hopefully I have helped someone with a purchasing decision. I will follow-up in a few months to give my opinions on if the products they bundle hold up to lots of use. Give me a helpful click if you enjoyed my very brief review of Vilros RPi Essentials kit.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="amazing-except-for-the-documentation">Amazing! (except for the documentation)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I am a techie so I realize I have difficulty viewing things from a newbie perspective. Having said that, I will try to make this review as non-techie as possible.The only reason I would be tempted not give 5 stars to this product is due to the inappropriate documentation that comes with it. However, I am so pleased with this package that I really want to give it 5 stars, so I did.The Raspberry Pi (RP) board itself came in its own box in the package. It included a &ldquo;Getting Started Guide&rdquo;. Ignore it. You bought this package for all the goodies (case, SD card, etc) that came with it. That guide is written thinking that you only bought the RP board. There is also a &ldquo;Raspberry PI Quick Start Guide&rdquo; included in the package. It&rsquo;s more complete, but it&rsquo;s not written for this particular kit. Don&rsquo;t throw it away, but you can&rsquo;t follow the instructions in the order in which it is written. And there are instructions in the guide that you won&rsquo;t care about. for example installing NOOBS on the SD card, because the SD card in the package comes with NOOBS already installed. This would really confuse newbies. When I further reference the guide below, this is the one I&rsquo;m talking about.So, here is what I recommend doing in the order that you need to do it.1) Unpack everything and make sure nothing looks damaged. If it does, don&rsquo;t even mess with it. Get it replaced.2) Take the case apart CAREFULLY. It is very well made and fits together really well. If you&rsquo;re applying force you&rsquo;re not doing the right thing. Slow down and take your time. There are 3 case parts. The top (it has a Raspberry logo stamped into it), the bottom (it has rubber feet on it) and the other part I&rsquo;ll call the middle. Take off the top first and then separate the middle and bottom.3) Follow the guide instructions for installing the heat sinks on the board.4) Put the card in the case in this order:a) Put the card in the bottom piece; the end with the SD card slot will slide under 2 plastic tabs and then the other end with all the USB port on it will drop into place.b) slide the middle piece down onto the bottom piece; it only goes one way. Use very slight pressure and wiggle around a bit if necessary until you hear a nice click and you will see that it seats well.c) put on the top piece. This also will only go in one way. Don&rsquo;t try to push it too far in. It&rsquo;s made to seat on 4 legs and it leaves a ventilation crack all the way around the perimeter. In other words, don&rsquo;t expect this piece to push down until there&rsquo;s no opening like the other 2 pieces. It comes off and goes back on VERY easily.5) Insert the SD card per the instructions in the guide6) Attach a USB keyboard and mouse using the USB slots. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which USB ports you use.Note: I thought I had a keyboard and mouse with USB connectors on them but I couldn&rsquo;t find them. I have a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Keyboard and Mouse that are wireless and connect to a computer via a USB dongle. Having no other options at the time, I tried using it. IT WORKED! The installation recognized the keyboard and mouse and I was able to continue on.7) Attach a monitor using the HDMI cable. This assumes you have a monitor that has an HDMI port. If you don&rsquo;t, there are adapters that allow an HDMI cable to be used with other types of ports. Do a search and you&rsquo;ll find them (or borrow a USB keyboard and mouse from a friend for a few hours).8) Plug in the power cord to the PI. It will boot up and present a window that allows you to install Raspbian. As I previously mentioned, NOOBS was already on the SD card and I didn&rsquo;t have to do anything else to it. Just power it up and install.9) Install. The installation window has several icons greyed out. The two that were active were the &ldquo;Install&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wireless&rdquo; buttons. I didn&rsquo;t know if I needed to configure wireless before installing. It turns out, you don&rsquo;t. However, I clicked on the wireless button first and it found my wireless router and I connected to it. When that happened the Install window all of a sudden displayed a LOT more installation choices. I assume that was because it connected to the internet and displayed more options. Ignore all those other choices and install the one on the SD card (Raspbian).I&rsquo;ll leave the rest up to you. Read the rest of the guide for useful information (e.g, how to restart, shutdown, use the Desktop, etc.). There is a ton of details available on the internet for the installation process, how to configure wireless, etc. If you have another PC, tablet, Smartphone handy it might help, if you&rsquo;re not sure about something during the installation, to find the answer.Other than the lack of instructions that should be included for this specific product, I am extremely pleased.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="fun-project-computer">Fun project computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Enjoyed the simplicity and ease of this kitCase fits together snugly, heat sinks installed easily (they have double-sided tape on them, if you&rsquo;re wondering) and OS installed without a hitchCurrently have it hooked up to a spare monitor and am impressed with how easily it streams 1080p live video from Youtube, although I would recommend placing a small desk fan next to it to help keep it cool - even with the case open and heat sinks it tends to get warm after about 20 minutes and there is a temperature warning icon that shows up on screenHaving a preinstalled basic version of Minecraft was awesome as well!My only minor gripe would be the power plug not having an on/off switch, but I knew that when ordering the kit so no biggieCan&rsquo;t wait to see what else it&rsquo;s capable of!</p>

<h5 id="solid-user-experience">Solid user experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great package if you want to get a machine set up and running quickly. I bought this machine to have a separate machine for maintaining a web site, keeping separation from my other computers. Within just a few minutes, I had it all assembled and working, and with just a bit of research, I was able to connect to it with VNC and get to work.One thing I found was that the OS I loaded (Raspbian) was out of date, so I needed to update and upgrade to be able to download other software.I&rsquo;m very please with my new system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-for-the">Good value for the $</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to assemble and get going comes with everything you need in the box and very nicely packaged. Installing Raspbian was a breeze however, my only issue is that following the included quick start guide and trying to install RetroPie did not work I would get an error message every time that it would not work on a stretch version of Raspbian. So as of being able to emulate games on this which was the sole purpose I bought this for I cannot really say how good it works. When I get more time to tinker with it I will update but as of now I have a nice paperweight.</p>
