</ul>

<p>The black X3 (2nd Gen) from Fiio is a portable high resolution audio player and USB-DAC for audio enthusiasts. The unit features an audiophile grade architecture and premium components capable of playing files up to 24-bit/192 kHz in a variety of formats including native DSD, WAV, WMA, ALAC, FLAC, APE, AIFF, and more. The X3-II utilizes a Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC coupled to a finely tuned low-pass filter offering extremely low noise and phase distortion. Additionally, the tantalum capacitors in the analog circuit provide minimal internal resistance for the best uncolored sound. Dual crystal oscillators ensure the lowest jitter and highest precision playback of music at any sample rate, eliminating conversion artifacts.</p>

<p>The player offers a standard <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; / 3.5mm headphone output and a separate line out/digital (coaxial) out via <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; / 3.5 mm. The X3II has no on-board memory, but uses a microSD card slot supporting up to 128 GB. The 2600 mAh Li-polymer battery provides up to 11 hours of playback under normal conditions. The user interface (UI) offers six unique themes, while the classic scroll wheel and 2.0&rdquo; TFT display offer easy navigation, which supports browsing and playback via folders, songs, albums, artists, genres, favorites, and playlists. The 10-band graphic EQ and the 120-step digital volume control allow for custom tailored sound and levels. The chassis is made of aluminum alloy and features a high reflectance fine-grain faceplate. The X3-II ships with a 3&rsquo; / 1m high-current micro-USB data/charging cable, an <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; / 3.5mm coaxial S/PDIF adapter, a hard-shell case, two screen protectors (1 applied in-factory), and a set of three Bodywork stickers (USA flag, wood grain, and carbon fiber).</p>

<h5 id="the-audio-fidelity-i-wanted-and-a-simple-reliable-player">The audio fidelity I wanted, and a simple reliable player.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The audio fidelity I wanted, and a simple reliable player.I was sick of my experience with a smartphone as my daily music player on my commute. IMHO, a smartphone is a jack of all trades, but master of none. My library of music has transitioned from lossy, low quality mp3&rsquo;s to all lossless FLAC, and various other lossless formats. I spend at least 2 hours in my car each day and really enjoy my music. I spent a decent amount of money on full range quality speakers and head unit to hear the details of my favorite tunes more clearly. Though the smartphone did ok, it was convenient it had too many other functions, which lead to a plethora of interruptions and of course the underscoring problem of noise and poor reproduction of sound. I&rsquo;d had my eye on a FiiO DAP for years now, and decided I&rsquo;d had enough of the fighting with my dumb &ldquo;smartphone&rdquo; and bought the X3 II. No regrets! I immediately got what I wanted, glorious detailed sound. No BS, not even a clock! What need would you have for it anyway? Just pure simple controls and all the enjoyment of my music library to drown out the sounds of traffic and people for my ride to and from work. The line out is the best part, it delivers the audio clean and un-amplified to my car stereo and lets the stereo do the work after that.The DAC on PC function is a welcome use too, I previously used my FiiO EO7K as a DAC on PC for great headphone playback of movies and music with no noise and great amplification. And the X3 II does this even better with its line out and SPDIF, COAX, options. Its plug and play on linux, needs a driver package install on windows. Which FiiO has recently nailed down with a great installer. Battery life seems really good. Easy to load files onto with Storage mode, or with an external micro sd reader and a PC.In all the ways that matter this player kicks ass. Very happy :)Only complaints:-The included skins (vinyl stickers) are neat and welcome to protect from scratches, but they have the major side effect of being huge lint magnets&hellip;making your spiffy new player look like it had been left in a corner of an uncleaned room for a year after one time in a pocket.-The screen isn&rsquo;t bright enough. And its small, so its almost impossible for me to read in daylight, forget while driving&hellip;thankfully it supports album art and that shows well at least.-DSD playback seems iffy and buggy with some files-Playlist creation sucks, unless I&rsquo;ve missed something you have to play any track you wish to add to a list in order to add it&hellip;-</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-music-player">Wonderful Music Player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this music player, which I&rsquo;ve had for about three months now. It is very compact, but the sound quality is excellent. I have been disappointed with several MP3 players I&rsquo;ve tried. I&rsquo;ve been disappointed with the sound quality of MP3 in general. It&rsquo;s too muddy, especially at higher volumes. The FLAC format (24-bit 96 kHz) is a wonderful alternative. The X3-II is more than powerful enough to push most earbuds and low impedance headphones by itself. I did find it a little lacking when I listen through high impedance studio headphones. I solved this by purchasing the FIIO E-12 Mont Blanc amp as a supplemental device. The seller delivered this unit on time. It was well-packaged for transit.</p>

<h5 id="up-your-audio-game-become-edm-compliant">Up your Audio Game. Become EDM compliant.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased the FiiO X1 to begin with. Unfortunately I received a defective unit that would not play several lossless formats that were listed to be compatible. I ended up purchasing the FiiO X3-II which solved all the issues. If looking to purchase this unit I would strongly suggest looking at the FiiO X3-II or X5. Much higher priced DACs are made by Pioneer and Sony but FiiO offers a much more affordable solution with their devices.FiiO provide regular firmware update on their website. A fascinating aspect to unboxing this product was the quality of the packaging and the included accessories. The device comes with 3 full body skins (carbon fiber black, light wood grain, and (MERICA) a US flag theme)). Also included are 3 screen protectors and a decent plastic snap on case. Very Impressive.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-mp3-player">love this MP3 player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love this MP3 player. sound quality is way better than any iPod or MP3 player I had ever used. the music from this fiio x3 sound even better than my oppo ha2 se amp, granted the fiio doesn&rsquo;t get as loud as the oppo but the sound quality coming out of the fiio x3 is much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-pleased-with-the-quality-and-sound-of-this-player">Very pleased with the quality and sound of this player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FiiO X3 version 2. Very pleased with the quality and sound of this player. I like the fact that it does not use proprietary software like my old Creative Zen Jukebox. I am able to create folders with my Windows computer and just drag and drop into the SD card. And since I am able to have 128 gigs at my disposal I just create different folders with different types of music and just use the folders for my playlists. A lot of the songs are duplicated between playlists but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter with so much hard drive space available. The player is very smooth and may slip out of your hand so be sure to add the Dignis leather case. It&rsquo;s a very nice high quality leather case that should stand the test of time.</p>

<h5 id="great-replacement-for-ipod-zune-creative-zen-cowon">Great Replacement for IPod/Zune/Creative Zen/Cowon!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Replacement for IPod/Zune/Creative Zen/Cowon!!! Higher quality sound!!! Easy &amp; more options when copying ITunes, Amazon or other Music files. Lack any wireless headphone options, and doesn&rsquo;t have all the bells &amp; whistles of an IPod or Zune. Still reviewing</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-dac-option-of-this-dap">Love the DAC option of this DAP!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the reviews on head-fi.org.A terrific product, sound, and value.You can use this as a beautiful sounding Hi res audio player with natural slightly warm neutral sound as well as a DAC to listen to your music on you computer with much better quality. I use it for my listing to music and streaming on my mac by using its DAC option as much as I use it as a Digital Audio Player.</p>

<p>Sounds amazing, great build quality, but disappointing interface. Making internal playlists is borderline impossible, and importing playlists is very complicated</p>
