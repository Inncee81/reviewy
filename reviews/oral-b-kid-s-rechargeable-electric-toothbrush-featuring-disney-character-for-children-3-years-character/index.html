<h5 id="oral-b-the-b-stands-for-best">Oral B – The B stands for Best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been searching for a new toothbrush for my daughter and the Oral B Pro-Health Power Rechargeable Toothbrush is the treasure I was searching for. My daughter has lost a number of her baby teeth (as five year olds tend to do) and I’d recently noticed that she wasn’t brushing her teeth as well. I guess it is hard to get excited about brushing the three teeth she has left :o) She had a Crest Spinbrush before and the gaps in her teeth seemed to make it less effective. I was interested in something that would allow her to focus more on each individual tooth and in comes Oral-B. I received this toothbrush as a gift in exchange for my honest review and the timing couldn’t have been more perfect. I am familiar with Oral-B products as I have an Oral-B Precision 5000 for my own use so I was excited to see what the kid version was capable of. My daughter was immediately drawn in by the Finding Dory Theme as I received the toothbrush right around the time this movie was being heavily advertised and she already loved Finding Nemo. She enjoys the music it plays when removing the toothbrush from the base and the tune it plays to tell her to switch from the top to the bottom. There was a small learning curve getting her to brush each tooth versus the sweeping motion she was accustomed to with the SpinBrush and other more traditional toothbrush heads. Luckily, she had it down after the first couple brushes. I was a bit worried that the toothbrush head might be too aggressive for her mouth but seems to provide just the right amount of scrubbing to her teeth and gums. Plus the toothbrush heads are not too hard and not too soft for their more sensitive mouths. The toothbrush is extremely kid friendly and seems to be fairly ergonomic for their small hands. I think the similarities to the more mature designed adult version adds to the appeal for kids; especially if their parents have a similar toothbrush, which I do. She definitely has more independence and seems more mature about her oral care now that she has a “big girl” toothbrush that’s like Daddy’s. Let’s not forget there was an immediate improvement in my daughter’s brushing over the last few weeks. The mild buildup I was noticing while using the SpinBrush was no more and she was actually excited about brushing again. So much so that there were a number of days where she brushed &ldquo;just because&rdquo; without having had a meal or snack. The initial charging time was reasonable and the charge seems to hold most of the week if left off the base. I can’t say enough good things about this toothbrush.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>great toothbrush&hellip;my 2 year son loves it and it cleans his teeth thoroughly. my only complaint is, why you can&rsquo;t choose your character at checkout. we were hoping to get a dory toothbrush but got cars instead. not a deal breaker but a slight disappointment. seems like it would be an easy fix to offer both options when ordering.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-preschoolers">Great for preschoolers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wish that we had gotten this toothbrush sooner! We have a 3.5 year old that has always cooperated with brushing his teeth but I still didn&rsquo;t feel like we were doing a good enough job. I was always worried that I was brushing too hard or too soft. We tried a cheaper electric toothbrush but I felt that it was just WAY too big for him. This toothbrush is the perfect size for him and works great! The music feature is really soft but that does not really matter. I highly recommend downloading the app that goes with it. My son is so excited every morning and night to brush his teeth and get his sticker. It has definitely helped us to start hitting 2 full minutes of brushing without him getting too antsy. Highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-toothbrush">Fantastic toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best kids toothbrush ever. It is small enough for my 4yr old to hold it , the head is small and does a great job cleaning. I keep it in the charger all the time knowing that it can&rsquo;t over charge. Thats a plus for me. We haven&rsquo;t traveled so far , therefore I cannot comment on how long does a charge lasts. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.</p>

<h5 id="seems-like-i-have-to-charge-it-overnight-for-best-performance">seems like i have to charge it overnight for best performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had it for about a month and from the beginning, the battery is weak. seems like i have to charge it overnight for best performance. come to think of it I have the same issue with my adult oral-b. Since this is for toddlers, the battery power is even worst. my three year old is ok with it. i have problems brushing the outer side of the bottom row of her mouth - could be because the brush is a little big for her.</p>

<h5 id="reluctant-brusher-this-might-be-the-ticket">Reluctant brusher? This might be the ticket!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already used an Oral-B electric brush before I bought this for my 5-year-old son. His dentist said he needed to brush a little better, so I decided to give this a try (in lieu of more heated toothbrushing &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; at bedtime). He was thrilled with this toothbrush! He loves Disney&rsquo;s Cars, so this was an easy way to get him to brush his teeth more thoroughly. We use the Magic Timer app, and he loves to see what stickers he will earn that day. We&rsquo;ve noticed an obvious improvement in his willingness to brush for the full 2 minutes (and more sometimes!), and the toothbrush pauses to let him know when to switch to a new section of his mouth. If you have a reluctant brusher, this might be for you!I might deduct <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> a star for the length of time it took to get to us, but it was worth the wait.</p>

<h5 id="very-short-songs-we-only-know-3-or-them">very short songs &amp; we only know 3 or them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 3.5 year old daughter likes this. She refused to use the Oral B kid&rsquo; toothbrush which doesn&rsquo;t have music. I like the fact that when being charged, the light is flashing indicating it&rsquo;s in the process of charing just like adult&rsquo;s toothbrush. The other kid&rsquo;s kid doesn&rsquo;t have. I don&rsquo;t like the fact that the music is very very short. Just one sentence &amp; there are only 3 of them that we know from which songs : ex: &ldquo;Old Mc.Donald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O&rdquo;I wish they use more popular songs that kids know &amp; the song should be longer (or at least it allows me to choose a longer or short song)&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrific-toothbrush">Terrific Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves this. My mom got one for her house for him and he plays with it. So I had to purchase one for him at my house. He loves how it plays music when he takes it off the charger. Then it sings a song when he is done brushing on part of his mouth, and sings again when the other portion is not. It is a great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stopped-working">Stopped working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son used this toothbrush around 5 times before it stopped working. It never played a tune, and it stopped charging completely.</p>
