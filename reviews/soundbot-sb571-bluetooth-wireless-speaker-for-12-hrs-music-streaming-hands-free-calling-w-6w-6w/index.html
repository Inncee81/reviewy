<h5 id="very-impressed">Very Impressed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very impressed with the great sound from this little speaker. I only have one complaint, well&hellip; two complaints, which I will explain below.ProsCheap (got it for $21 during a sale)Great sound (low noise, low distortion, as claimed)Surprisingly good bass response (as low as 50 or 60 Hz)Very loud, twice the power output of many other Jambox clones (6W per driver instead of 3W)Long battery lifeBluetooth connection works wellMicroUSB charging port is convenientDedicated volume buttons is a plusConsUses female voice to announce status (&ldquo;Pairing!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pairing NOT completed.&rdquo;, etc.)These sound clips interrupt music playback, which is very annoying, especially when you&rsquo;re not even using Bluetooth and just want to use AUX inSimilarly, if you reach the maximum volume and press the volume up button again, it will interrupt your music to make two beeping soundsDespite these two minute issues, I am giving it five stars because I feel this product deserves more attention. Not one website mentioned this product when I searched for reviews of portable Bluetooth speakers, but it is probably one of the best in the &lt;$100 price range.</p>

<h5 id="much-better-tha-expected">Much better tha expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 3 - one for each of my teenage kids for Christmas. I have to say that when I heard them that morning, I was shocked at the sound quality. The bass was very good from a cabinet of that size, and the overall sound quality was great. The volume is awesome, with plenty of sound to fill a room. The Bluetooth pairing was a breeze (Samsung Galaxy, Note, and an IPhone). I&rsquo;d have to say this is without a doubt the best speaker I&rsquo;ve heard for the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-little-speaker">Awesome little speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome little speaker! My work vehicle does not have Bluetooth. I bought this so I can listen to music and so I can hear the maps instructions. If you are looking for a speaker to vibrate the windows in your car then this is not the speaker. For my use it is perfect. I listen to a lot of news radio and the voices are crisp and clear. When listening to music the sound quality is very clear. It is loud at full volume and at times I do have to turn it down. The battery gets me through a full day of work with no issues. The only thing I have noticed is that if I am using it solely for the directions from map there is a little bit of lag or delay. It will miss the first few words of the instructions. That doesn&rsquo;t bother me. If I have music or news radio playing then it mutes whatever I am listening to and I never miss a word. This is a great little speaker for the price. The first two I bought I gave as gifts and after my experience with them when I wanted one for for my work vehicle I did not hestitate to buy this speaker for myself. It has not disappointed me as of yet and I am super pleased with this speaker.</p>

<h5 id="wow-what-a-great-little-speaker">Wow! What a great little speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the market for a Bluetooth speaker for a while now and was planning on buying the Amazon basic speaker. After doing some more research I decided to buy this one instead and boy am I happy I did! This thing is small, but it packs a punch! I mainly use this to listen to my audiobooks/music in my car while I&rsquo;m driving (older car). I place this on my cup holder under where the radio is and it sits perfectly.Connection was a breeze. I have tried listening to music from Pandora or youtube and have noticed a long lag/buffering time. I&rsquo;m not really concerned with it since I don&rsquo;t use the speaker for that purpose, but something to keep in mind if that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re buying this. I like that it came with an aux cable, so I can plug in my ipod.I have the speaker next to my bed and listen to my audiobooks at the end of the night or when I wake up and it&rsquo;s worked great. Can have my audiobooks going on my iphone and be checking mail and so on with no issues. The little blinking blue light can be distracting at night for some, but I&rsquo;ve just turned mine upside down on my nightstand and it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. The same for the red light when I charge it at night. The battery life has been great as well. So impressed and happy!</p>

<h5 id="do-not-try-this-at-home">Do Not Try This At Home.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay. This review comes 4 months after my purchase. I felt the need to either edit or write a review for this product after I accidentally dropped it in the clothes washer. While taking care of my domestic duties, the speaker must have fallen off the shelf into my pile of clothes to be washed. It was in the water for about 5 seconds. I quickly pulled it out and allowed it to dry face down. After 36 hours, I attempted to charge it. IT WORKED! I do believe having the USB and audio cable attached saved me. Sounds like it never got wet. I thought sure I was going to have to order a new one.Great speaker. The picture describing the speaker is pretty accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good-for-the-price">Pretty Good for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, it&rsquo;s a nice little unit. It may not satisfy bass heads or people who are used to more expensive speakers, but if you keep your expectations reasonable, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.I see a lot of reviews complaining about a female voice. I think the company has fixed that issue on new ones, because I haven&rsquo;t heard any voice from my unit. It always beeps when you turn it on and beeps a different tone when Bluetooth connection is established. The beep is not excessively loud or annoying to me.This product is also nice for listening to podcasts and audio books. In other words it&rsquo;s good for both music and voice.Pros:- Reasonably priced- Sounds pretty good for the price (don&rsquo;t expect Bose sound)- also good for audio books and podcast listening (no excessive boom added to voices)- long bluetooth range - I can take the unit upstairs or to the back porch while the phone is downstairs.- the volume buttons are separate from the back/forward buttons.- loud enough to fill the entire bedroomCons:- The bass is slightly lacking depending on the type of music, but this also contributes to the versatility of the unit being good for both music and voice.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-for-the-price">Great Product for the Price</h5>

<p>Speaker is a good size (small enough to carry around but big enough to put out a good amount of volume) and will get loud without distorting the audio quality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clear sound. Super loud for being so small. Sturdy and works with old Bluetooth iPods. Good bang for your buck.</p>
