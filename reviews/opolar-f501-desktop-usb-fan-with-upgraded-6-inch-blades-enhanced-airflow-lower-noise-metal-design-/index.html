<h5 id="almost-perfect">Almost Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I paid for this with my own money at full price with no discount so, you know my review is unbiased.I get hot very easy so, I’m not sure why I live in a desert. The house has A/C but, when we go camping every year or if the power goes out, I need something to cool me down while I sleep. This USB fan can run off my laptop or portable power bank and only uses 2.5 watts per hour. I like the on/off switch but, usually I will just unplug it when I want it off. It puts out a lot of air for its size but, not as much as I was expecting so, I’ll have to buy another one before we go camping next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-silent-and-powerful-little-fan">Small, Silent and Powerful little fan !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little fan for the price!! I have it plugged into the back of my smart tv and use it to keep the tv, my amazon fire stick and my wireless router cool. We all know that these electronics put off heat and this fan keeps everything cool to the touch. I will purchase it again for my other tv&rsquo;s and electronic devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quiet-good-looking-and-great-customer-service">Quiet, good looking, and great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first fan arrived damaged in shipping, and the seller sent a replacement right away. The replacement looks great, the fan outputs a fair amount of power, and is quiet. I also tested that the fan can work off a USB battery, and this will be great for when I take my son camping and the tent gets too hot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="totally-surprised-by-this-fan-this-is-so-cool-pun-intended">Totally surprised by this fan. This is so cool (pun intended)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan is amazing, It&rsquo;s quiet and it does the job. I am in the middle east and my home does have AC, but not in all the rooms. This is where this fan shines. The fact that its get its power from a USB port, makes all the difference in the world. I do not have to worry about power cords or outlets. I have several external battery packs that I use to charge my cell phones and most of them are sitting in my dresser as I only need one. You would think it would drain your batteries after a couple of hours but that is simply not the case. When I am at the computer, I just plug it into the USB port there.The fan is compact, easy to carry in my backpack. I have since purchased a second fan so I can keep it at work instead of bringing it back and forth. I write very few reviews, but this one is a winner. Inexpensive, and highly functional.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fan-best-14-i-ever-spent">Great fan! Best $14 I ever spent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great fan, I love it. I bought the 6&rdquo; blade model. I use it on myself, and on my dog, Jack. He&rsquo;s a 16 lb miniature poodle. He loves it also. I have my AC on at 73F and he&rsquo;s still panting. Therefore the only thing to do is to get him a fan. It&rsquo;s quiet, I use it when I am sleeping and reading. I have a fan running on my left and on my right side.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quiet-and-cool">Quiet and cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is quiet and very good..soo good that I had to point it away from me as I was getting cold. I am in an office where there aren&rsquo;t a lot of AC plugs left open but I did have a USB port replicator device so I thought I would try a USB fan. I have had other USB fans and typically they are louder than this and some did not move that much air. This did the trick.Next time I go camping in hot weather, I am tempted to pack this with me along with a USB battery to see how well it does.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-right-for-me-and-my-desk">Just right for me and my desk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the idea it runs on USB, and that I can make it portable using a battery pack. Sits on my desk giving me the soft flow of air I was looking for. Don&rsquo;t need high horsepower, just a gentle breeze. The main noise is the familiar blade spinning noise. It is fairly quite, but it seems to give off a faint ringing noise that appears to not happen when I hold it in my hand. I&rsquo;m working on either a way to hang it or set it on the right surface to minimize the sound. It&rsquo;s probably just me and my sensitivity to high pitched sounds. Not a big deal. I really like the stand. You can use it to hang from a wall and point it where you want (it angles 360 degrees). I hope it is durable over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-breeze">It&rsquo;s a breeze</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Gotta say this little thing is a lifesaver&hellip; it&rsquo;s right next to my bed hooked up to a USB AC charger (not included) and if the room gets hot at night I don&rsquo;t have to get up and turn up the AC or open a window I can just turn it on half in my sleep. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have enough air noise to keep me from falling asleep however sometimes it&rsquo;s cooled me enough so if it&rsquo;s not needed I reach over and turn it off still in sleep mode ;). It doesn&rsquo;t seem to disturb my husband either. I will offer that even when the room is warm the effect of the air being so close really does make the air it blows seem &lsquo;cooler&rsquo; - while that&rsquo;s mainly because in winter we keep the room cooler and in summer the room has already been cooled and dehumidified somewhat from the AC - this fan just acts as that little &lsquo;burst&rsquo; of cool.)Colors are great- this one was a brass burnished finish that actually goes with the decor so, good idea to offer more than white and colors like bright pink. The size is good enough to keep it steady and small enough to fit on a small section of a night stand.. Wishlist, a two speed version!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well">Works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like it and it works well. The only thing is that you can&rsquo;t plug it into an outlet you can only plug it into your computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-fan">Great little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great fan. It&rsquo;s a little bigger than I expected but it works great. It was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-little-noisy">A Little Noisy&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A little noisy but works well. Get a longer USB cord so you won&rsquo;t be having to deal with air blowing in your face at a close distance!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my desk at work, quiet and puts off enough air to keep me cool</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it-and-just-in-time-the-weather-is-getting">I love it and just in time the weather is getting &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it and just in time the weather is getting warm and I love the size as well as the usb plug.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-good-fan-pretty-quiet">It&rsquo;s a good fan, pretty quiet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this since my last fan died a couple of months ago. It&rsquo;s a good fan, pretty quiet, and moves quite a bit of air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-and-quiet-but-powerful">small and quiet but powerful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is perfect for my desk. I wish it had options for different speeds but other than that it works just dandy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: I didn&rsquo;t realize this thing was powered via USB. Luckily I have untold numbers of phone charger adapters laying around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great item</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-was-a-good-fan-when-it-worked">It was a good fan when it worked</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fan stopped working after a month or so. It was a good fan when it worked.</p>
