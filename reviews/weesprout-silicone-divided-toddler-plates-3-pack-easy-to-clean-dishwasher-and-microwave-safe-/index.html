<p>Make Your Life A Bit Easier With These Premium Baby Divided Plates</p>

<p>Being a parent is the world&rsquo;s toughest job. We know, we&rsquo;re parents as well. Mealtime, in particular, can be a nightmare: you&rsquo;ve prepared 4 different kinds of food, you&rsquo;ve used half a dozen different dishes - which you&rsquo;ll have to wash, there are food stains everywhere, and your little angel still refuses to eat.</p>

<p>They are microwave, dishwasher, oven, and freezer safe, easy to clean, and virtually unbreakable, no matter how naughty your little munchkin gets!</p>

<p>Your Baby&rsquo;s Safety Is Not To Be Taken Lightly - We Know!</p>

<p>Weesprout divided plates and other baby accessories are made by parents, for parents. We&rsquo;d never provide our customers with anything we wouldn&rsquo;t use for our kids ourselves.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we make a point of using nothing bit premium quality, pure silicone. Unlike the suspicious plastics lesser baby products are made of, it&rsquo;s free of BPA, pthalates, or other harmful and toxis materials, FDA approved, and 100% safe for your baby!</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-toddler-preschooler-approved">A++ Toddler/Preschooler APPROVED!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is exactly about WeeSprout, but we absolutely adore all of the products we&rsquo;ve had from their company. They hold up really well, are colorful and enticing for little kids to use, and are a good bargain in comparison to their competitors. These plates are no exception! My 4-year-old and 1-year-old are both enjoying them&hellip; They love how lightweight they are to hold and use, as do I! The bottoms even have a slight grip to them, which insures they stay in place both on a table and highchair&hellip; SUCH a convenient feature! Dishwasher friendly is of course the other huge bonus, though they&rsquo;re easy enough to quickly rinse clean due to their material. I can&rsquo;t imagine these will easily wear out, but if they do, I&rsquo;d definitely purchase more!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-little-nieces-and-nephews">Perfect for My Little Nieces and Nephews</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any kids of my own but I have been around my nieces and nephews enough at meal time to know how quickly a food disaster can happen. I like how these plates have higher sides to help keep food on the plate and off the high chair tray and floor. The divided portions are nice so the kids can see and appreciate the different foods for them. The colors are vibrant and kids live them. What I appreciate the most is they are unbreakable and non skid so they don&rsquo;t slide off the table as easily but if they do or get thrown they don&rsquo;t break or make a loud crashing sound when they do hit the floor. Dishwasher, microwave, freezer and oven safe. Very convenient. Love these plates and so do my nieces and nephews.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-size">Great size!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so cute! They seem very durable. I plan to use them for picnics for my 2 and 5 year old. The material seems like it will wash up very nicely. The portioned sections are perfect size for all the sides included in their picnic meals (cheese slices, grapes, strawberries, etc.). These plates are also the perfect size as they&rsquo;re not too large that they&rsquo;ll fill up their plates with unnecessary foods, but not too small that they need to keep refilling (and risk spilling while doing so). The colors are vibrant and fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-plates">Love these plates</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these plates! They are silicone but heavy duty, not flimsy at all. My toddlers can carry them from kitchen to dining room without risk of them bending or being flimsy. The best part is they&rsquo;re dishwasher safe. My toddlers don&rsquo;t mind food touching, but I like to have my food seperated, so why not do the same with my kids food. Weesprout as a whole makes fantastic products. I have many of their products and these do not disappoint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-fun-little-plates">Love these fun little plates!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love these plates. They are fantastic. The colors are fun, they wash up so easily and are the perfect size for our little tot. Great price, great product. We use these every day and have zero complaints! Will probably order a second set in the future when our second son is ready for table food. I like that I don&rsquo;t have to worry if my son throws it, that it will break or cause damage to anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-set">Great set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These plates are great for little ones! They are a good size, and fun bright colors. Dishwasher and microwave safe makes them practical for any meal, and I love how they sort of &ldquo;stick in place&rdquo; on the table and the counter - it definitely helps prevent a few (not all, because little ones can definitely still pick up and throw the whole plate if they want to haha) major messes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-silicone-is-perfect-for-my-baby-who-also-likes-to-chew-on-everything-at-this-age">The silicone is perfect for my baby who also likes to chew on everything at this age</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these!! The silicone is perfect for my baby who also likes to chew on everything at this age. It also means it&rsquo;s not as interesting to play with because it doesn&rsquo;t make loud banging noise when he knocks it so it really increases our chances of keeping the plate ON the table. Which if you have a toddler, you know is no small feat. The one feature I do wish this had is suction cups on the bottom so it would help to stick to the table. I have another one that does that and I love that feature. BUT, these are amazing anyway and they have been a big hit in our house.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-and-stay-put">Sturdy and stay put</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used similar toddler plates with different sections. What I love about these plates is the material. It is flexible but still sturdy, the texture of the material helps the plate stay put better than the hard plastic. The material is super easy to clean and so far has not stained from any food. I will definitely look to buy more to replace my others in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-looked-at-the-pictures-others-posted-and-thought-they-were-a-good-size-wish-they-were-a-tad-bigger">I looked at the pictures others posted and thought they were a good size. Wish they were a tad bigger</h5>

<p>They were a little smaller than I thought. I looked at the pictures others posted and thought they were a good size. Wish they were a tad bigger.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-toddler">Perfect for my toddler</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>GReat plates. Needed a plate to divide up toddlers food. Works great so far. No stains from tomato sauce. I don&rsquo;t like to use plastic and these are great for microwave.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="purchased-for-special-needs-cats">Purchased for Special Needs Cats</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to make it clear, I did not buy these for a child but for special needs cats. This is the third brand of silicone dishes I have purchased and they are not nearly as&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pleasantly-surprised">Pleasantly surprised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are fairly nice. Sturdier than expected. One solid piece. No peeling of paints. It fits in my Chico 360 hook on high chair tray. Happy kids!</p>
