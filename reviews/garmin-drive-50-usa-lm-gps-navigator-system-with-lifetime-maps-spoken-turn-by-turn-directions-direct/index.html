<h5 id="drive-60-lmt-vs-drivesmart-60-lmt">Drive 60 LMT vs. DriveSmart 60 LMT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I may just be a picky user, but figured my review my help others decide on what device to buy. I originally updated to a Garmin Drive 60 LMT from an older Nuvi 1450 LMT. Screen size and smoothness/speed were main considerations. Shortly after purchasing, updating software and maps, and installing in my car I was disappointed. The 6&rdquo; screen is nice and big but&hellip;.it is nowhere near as bright as the older versions. At 100% brightness it was about as bright as the Nuvi 1450 at 40 - 50% brightness. Likewise, if you wear polarized sunglasses, it will make the screen even darker (practically unreadable in some cases). I contacted Garmin and they confirmed that they polarize the screen on this device and, unfortunately, orient the polarization to interfere with polarized sunglasses. Everything else was great. That being said, if this doesn&rsquo;t bother you, or you only drive in overcast/dark conditions, you should be fine. I ended up returning and replacing with a DriveSmart 60 LMT (I did have to pay a little more obviously). Completely different device. Brighter, sharper/crisper screen, and not subject to polarized sunglass issues. That along with the other added features (bluetooth, voice command, swipe touch screen, etc.). My only gripe, and I&rsquo;ll be fine with it, is that to get the nice crisp and sharp graphics, Garmin used a glass screen that is not matte. Therefore, you see fingerprints easier, and it is reflective. If you&rsquo;re looking at both, maybe this observation will help. You can add a matte screen protector but I&rsquo;ve found that those will make the screen less crisp sharp (especially text).</p>

<h5 id="the-reasons-i-like-this-better-than-google-maps">The reasons I like this better than google maps</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Garmin Drive 50 USA LMI bought this GPS unit as a backup for google maps on my Nexus 5 for a cross country trip from IL to CA. Surprisingly by the end of the trip, I found myself using the Garmin about 99% of the time. I am comparing this unit against google maps that I use 99% of the time otherwise.The reasons I like this better than google maps:1. The split screen was really informative - especially with large lane guidance in unfamiliar areas and upcoming stops displayed next to the map without having to navigate away from the live map. This may not be a problem with long stretches of roads but in a city for example, the ability to show important stops like gas, food and rest stops without having to risk going away from the map and losing a turn.2. The &ldquo;Up next&rdquo; info was probably the most useful feature for me as the three most important things during a long trip Viz. Food, Fuel and rest areas are very conveniently shown next to the map. This allowed me to get fuel at the upcoming gas station if the next one after that (whose distance was also shown as part of what&rsquo;s up next information) was going to be 100 miles away. This saved my from running out of fuel a couple of times in the middle of the AZ/NM/NV area.3. The current speed limit was very helpful and I found it was about 100 yards off from the signs posted (i.e. the GPS took about 100 yards to catch up with the posted speed limit signs). This is better than google maps which does not have any such information at all.4. Offline navigation! This in itself was the main reason I brought a dedicated GPS unit and I was not disappointed! I shudder to think of not having navigation in the middle of Arizona/Utah because of lack of phone coverage.After using a dedicated GPS (while coming from a position of skepticism of it&rsquo;s usefulness over google maps), I will say that I probably will be using this GPS for all my long distance driving over using my phone (and leave my phone always connected to the charger). But for inner city navigation, I still prefer google maps/waze for almost instantaneous traffic based navigation.</p>

<h5 id="fabulous-gps-unit-could-not-be-happier">FABULOUS GPS UNIT. COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE this Garmin. I waited to write this review, until I used it for several trips. I&rsquo;ve previously owned a Garmin (long time ago), and more recently, a Magellan, that basically died on me. After doing a good deal of research and reading TONS of reviews on Amazon - I opted for this unit. Set-up is effortless. It loads quickly. Downloaded the necessary Garmin info to my computer, so updating it is a breeze. The visual is great. It gives clear, concise directions, with added info like, &ldquo;Turn right at the Shell station on your right&hellip;&rdquo;. Input is VERY easy. I cannot recommend it enough. I purchased the Garmin Portable Friction mount as well - and that has proven to be a DREAM COME TRUE. There is NO slipping, and I don&rsquo;t have to be bothered with the suction cup window mounts, which always drive me crazy. I am thrilled with this purchase, and highly recommend it. One of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve ever made, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Garmin Drive 50 is great. I upgraded from a Nuvi 260W and the difference is noticeable. Maps and spoken directions are great and the ability to know when speed limits drop or there are school zones ahead is a benefit. The traffic function is very useful when traveling.</p>

<h5 id="but-it-may-be-too-much-asking-for-garmin-to-satisfy-their-customers-by-supplying-a-device-that-actually-works">But it may be too much asking for Garmin to satisfy their customers by supplying a device that actually works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Garmin Drive 60 could not be charged with the original cables that came with it. I got an error message stating that charging is not supported. Please use the cable that came with the device ( which I did). Then I updated the software via Garmin Express hoping that would fix the problem but it didn&rsquo;t. The provided cable is only a measly foot long (the one for the car is longer). Tom Tom&rsquo;s cable is almost 5 feet! I wish Garmin would actually test each device individually if it can be charged using the cables provided. This is a problem that was also reported by other customers. But it may be too much asking for Garmin to satisfy their customers by supplying a device that actually works. If you can&rsquo;t charge your GPS, it does not function! I got a TomTom Go 60 and their supplied cable is not only longer (to make it more user friendly but it also lets you charge the GPS which is what a charging cable is supposed to do. I had to return the Garmin back to Amazon.</p>
