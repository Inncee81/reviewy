<p>Whether you are out for a relaxing day on the water or tracking miles down the coast, up the river, or across the lake, the iRocker Paddle Boards Cruiser is the perfect all around SUP.Â  Don&rsquo;t be surprised with all the looks and attention you get on this amazing looking SUP.
This board boasts 10&rsquo;6&rdquo; in length, 33&rdquo; in width, and a 6&rdquo; thickness. Â The 33&rdquo; width and extra wide tail makes the iRocker Cruiser as stable as an inflatable board comes in any water conditions, whether you are in choppy or flat water. Â 
The deck pad has been extended all the way to the tail of the board for those interested in Paddle Board Yoga, Fishing from your SUP, or you would like to take a cruise with your significant other. Â 
The expanded front bungee area gives 3.3 square feet of storage space, enough room to secure all your gear. Â The D-Rings also allow you to strap your gear down so go ahead, pack your lunch box with dinner andÂ catch a perfect sunset out on the water.
The bottom of the board has a tri-fin set up with 2 side fins permanently fixed to the board and one larger removable center fin. Â The tri-fin set up allows for straight tracking while paddling to keep the side to side paddle motionÂ to a minimum. Â </p>

<p>Everything You Need, Nothing Left Out!</p>

<p>Not only is the iRocker Cruiser SUP Package equipped with everything you need, it is equipped with only the highest quality accessories available.
iRocker Fiberglass Paddle- Equipped with a 2 pin locking system that easily allows you to adjust the paddle from 67 to 79 inches. Â The iRocker fiberglass paddle is half the weight of standard aluminum paddles and much more durable as well. Â The paddle breaks down into 3 peices so that you can easily travel with the paddle and fit it into the supplied back pack carry bag. Â The outside edges of the blade are constructed of aÂ strong, resilient, rubber material for extra protection when pushing off of rocks, docks, or any launching pad. Â 
iRocker Ultra Light 37 oz. Dual Action High Capacity Hand Pump- Easily fits into the gear bagÂ and light enough so that you don&rsquo;t even notice it. Â This is a dual action high capacity hand pump that allows you to inflate your iRocker Cruiser as efficiently as possible. Â The dual action feature allows you to begin inflating by pushing air into the board during the up and down stroke of the pump. Â Once the PSIÂ begins to build up you can then switch to the single action feature that only pushes air into the board during the down stroke to make pumping easier. Â The pressure gauge on top lets you know exactly how much pressure is built up inside the board at all times. Â 
iRocker Back Pack Carry Bag- This is the most comfortable, high quality inflatable SUP bag on the market. Â Constructed of an extra thick canvas material so that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the bag ripping. Â The back pack consists of padded shoulder and waist straps. Â This allows for a very comfortable experience when hiking to your favorite SUP spot. Â Also equipped with an inner stabilizing board strap and outer cinching straps to keep your board from shifting inside the bag. Â This bag is large enough to not only carry all your gear but there is room to spare.
iRocker Premium Ankle Leash- You also receive the high quality iRocker Ankle Leash. Â This makes sure that your iRocker Cruiser SUP does not get too far should youÂ happen to fall from the board.

<h5 id="we-inflated-them-to-test-and-everything-seemed-good-so-we-hit-the-lake-the-next-day">We inflated them to test and everything seemed good so we hit the lake the next day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came well packed w no damage to box (props to delivery guy). My girlfriend bought a 10.5&rsquo; PEAK by Isle same day and this one is significantly larger - the bag and the board width when inflated. We inflated them to test and everything seemed good so we hit the lake the next day. It was not easy inflating to 15PSI. It seems almost fully inflated @ 7, but I pushed it to the recommended 15 and it held up great! We cruised the lake in the wind for over an hour without any issues. It tracked well and held down some items in the front cargo area very good (even when I fell and flipped it). I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; 240lbs and I use the paddle @ max length and it is probably a couple inches too short. Her paddle from PEAK is longer but did not work as well. The only issue I had is paddle length as am a tall guy.UPDATE 6/8/17 - This one is far more stable and rides better than her ISLE Peak board. The additional 3&rdquo; on the width help with stability as a newbie. We both tried both boards and we both like this one slightly better as far as ride and stability goes.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-board-for-beginners-and-families">Perfect Board for Beginners and Families</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After deciding to purchase some SUPs for a family activity, I scoured reviews for the best quality board and best value. Based on Amazon reviews, we were very close to purchasing 2 PEAK boards, but then I read multiple reviews from paddleboard blogs and websites that mentioned iRocker as one of the best boards (especially for beginners) out there with a growing following. I&rsquo;m so glad that I stumbled upon these reviews because based on an Amazon search alone, I probably would have never found them. We took them out on the lake the first night that we got them. First impressions were that the bag was much larger than I expected, but also very comfortable to wear thanks to the padded straps. That being said, I still wouldn&rsquo;t want to walk far with this on my back. This is a high quality roomy bag that I&rsquo;m sure will withstand years of use! The zipper (weakest spot on most bags) is very durable and will not split, I&rsquo;m sure. The pump is fantastic and from what I&rsquo;ve read, one of the highest quality hand pumps on the market. I was able to inflate the board in about 10 minutes and the last few pumps to get to 15 PSI were killer. We did purchase the Sevylor 12V 15-PSI pump because I&rsquo;d rather save my energy for paddling, so I&rsquo;ll update once we try the electric pump out. The board is very easy to carry once inflated. First time on the water, the weather was extremely windy and the water was quite choppy, so we were getting blown around quite a bit, but I was very impressed at how stable the board was in those conditions. The leash is very comfortable and I forget that I&rsquo;m wearing it - no chafing at all. The paddle floats, which is a huge bonus, performs well, and adjusts quickly. The next night, we took our 4 year old and had an amazing experience. The water was calm and there was little wind. Even with our kiddo crawling back and forth to put her feet in the water, I felt completely stable and was able to stand up with her on it right away. She even stood up and had no issues. We were able to get these boards up to speed and really see how they handle in good conditions and they were so easy and fun to use! Turned on a dime, amazing stability, and great tracking. Bungee straps are great for gear and kiddos to hang onto. We just ordered the kayak kits straight from iRocker and can&rsquo;t wait to try those out in windy conditions next time. Deflating is very LOUD at first (just be prepared if you&rsquo;re in a public area, people will turn around to see what&rsquo;s going on) and I&rsquo;m still struggling to get the pin to turn when deflating. Boards are very easy to roll up and put back into the bag.Pros:Affordable all-inclusive kit and accessoriesVery stableWide board and high weight limit for kiddos and other ridersMany D rings for gear and kayak seatAwesome customer service (I emailed about a question and heard back within minutes)Solid board - I don&rsquo;t think that I could damage these if I triedComfortable surface - my feet never got sore or tired after hours of paddlingCons:Only one color option, obviously not a deal breakerBackpack is difficult to maneuver, but it would be hard to make it much more compactBottom line:I research things to death and came to the conclusion before and after taking these out on the water that this is the best quality board and accessories that you can get in this price range. The brand is well known and the customer service is top-notch. The boards handle so well for beginners and young riders. We&rsquo;re looking forward to many years of fun with these! If you&rsquo;re on the fence, just buy this board - you won&rsquo;t regret it.<strong>EDIT</strong>After purchasing the Sevylor 12 Volt 15 PSI SUP and Water Sport Pump, we returned it because it didn&rsquo;t function properly (auto shut off didn&rsquo;t work), but also because it actually is much quicker to inflate using the manual pump. The electric pump made me realize how good the manual pump actually is, and now after about 6 uses, it&rsquo;s gotten easier and quicker. Still extremely satisfied with our purchase of these boards!</p>

<h5 id="irocker-cruiser-vs-sport">iRocker Cruiser vs Sport</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is our second iRocker SUP, the first was the 11&rsquo;6 Sport version. I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to the version and found the sport a little unstable for my 6&rsquo;3 250lb body. My wife on the other hand had very little problems (5&rsquo;5 130lbs). I bought the cruiser for her thinking it&rsquo;ll just take a little time for me to get comfortable on the Sport. Ironically she can use both with little balance issue so it looks like I&rsquo;m now the proprietor of the Cruiser.We paddleboarded in Jamaica last year on the resort&rsquo;s big Hobbie SUP&rsquo;s. It was fun so we wanted to get back in to it. With a hybrid car, midsize SUV, and not a lot of storage in the garage, we decided to get inflatable SUPs. Besides a week in Jamaica last year, we have no other PB experience.On the Sport my wife was up and paddling with no issue outside of the initial couple of wobbly stand ups and sit downs. She&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;5ish and has a low center of gravity.On the Sport I was very wobbly to stand up and very non-acrobatic to get back down. Paddling from a kneel or sitting position is no issue. After an hour or so and some forced stand-ups I was able to get up and shakily get going. This inflatable SUP is stable but nowhere as stable as the resorts big Hobbie&rsquo;s. After an hour or so I was comfortable enough but my legs were burning from the balance board session I had that day. The next time out we got the Cruiser and I used both boards. I was much less wobbly this time out and it was a lot easier to stand and get moving.The difference between the Cruiser and the Sport is not day-and-night but it is noticeable. For me the cruiser is more stable and easier to stand up on. The Sport definitely seems to glide through the water easier and faster. While noticeable, I don&rsquo;t know that the differences are so stark that you have to buy one over the other for your intended need. They are both great boards. If I had it to do over again (I&rsquo;m only 3 outings in) I&rsquo;d probably get the Cruiser but the stability differences are not so drastic that I&rsquo;m hating my Sport purchase - I just think I could of got up and going quicker and been confidently paddling sooner had I initially bought the Cruiser.This last outing I took the dog with us. A small 22lb Jack Russell. We got a life jacket for our fearless little family member. She rode fine though sometimes her moving around and biting at the wake did &ldquo;jack&rdquo; with my balance. She&rsquo;ll be going with us on future outings. Definitely a lot easier to have her as guest with me while I&rsquo;m on the Cruiser. On the Sport her movements have a little more effect on our vessel. I&rsquo;m sure all of this will smooth out over the next couple of outings.On a final note, I think the higher center of gravity for my 6&rsquo;3 body and the extra 100+lbs makes my initial experience with these inflatable SUPs a lot different than my wife&rsquo;s. Where I was wobbly and shaky she had minimal wobbles. I have better balance than her on land and in sports. With that said, I have no doubt both of these iRocker paddleboards will bring us a lot of fun and exhausting weekends. If you&rsquo;re a bigger guy/girl especially if you&rsquo;re taller, just understand that it&rsquo;s going to take a few sessions to get your SUP legs but be patient and keep at it. It gets easier each time.</p>
