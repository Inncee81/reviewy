<blockquote>
<p>This is a good stand seems to be built well but from my opinion not the best one in this price range. I have two other tv stands so I felt I could make a good comparison review.HEIGHT ADJUSTMENTS : The Echogear has four height adjustments in the back of the column where you remove 4 screws then move these screws to the next set of holes. My AEON model has three height adjustments where no screws need to be removed. To make the adjustment you simply change the vertical bars in one of three levels . I have attached a picture of the height differences between the two models . I bought the Echogear model for a 50 inch tv which works well and gives me about 3~4 inches of space between the bottom of the tv and the metal base . Note if you are considering the Echogear for a 55&rdquo; to 65&rdquo; TV you will have little to no space underneath your TV for components or to mount a soundbar underneath. This is because the total max height on the Echogear is much lower than on the AEON model.BASE: The immediate difference is that the AEON base is about 25~30% larger. I like the larger base because it allows me to put components on the glass under the tv . If I put my cable box on the Echogear model it is too deep and hangs off the front of the base . The Echogear base is stamped shell from thin metal to create a thick look. It is a black matte painted finish. The AEON model is very thick black tinted glass . This could be a personal prefernce but I like the look of the AEON much better and my concern with the metal base is that it will scratch and dent over time, where as the glass still looks great after 8 months of heavy use .COLUMN : The Echogear model is a two part column made of metal. The lower column has a small plate on the bottom which is welded in place with four small threaded screws to hold it in place. The inner column is small and slides inside the larger column to offer height adjustment capability . The Echogear column is painted with a flat black matte finish. The AEON model is a two part column system as well but of the same size on top and bottom . The upper part is for the swivel functionality . The AEON model is held to the glass plate with two large full length threaded rods which clamp between the glass and the top of the column forming a sandwhich. As a previous welder myself I like the idea that the AEON has no welds to fail. The outer finish of the AEON column is a high gloss black painted finish .SWIVEL: The Echogear and the AEON models both have good swivel range and function. The AEON model seems to swivel with a little less ease.STABILITY : The Echogear and the AEON both seems like they are strong and stable tv stands. I have a 50&rdquo; 40 pound tv on the Echogear and a 60&rdquo; 58 pound tv and 10 pound soundbar on the AEON . Neither model leans , but my Echogear does tilt down to the left on one side a few degrees . I put a shim in to fix this problem.ASSEMBLY: Echogear has the slight advantage here, I put the Echogear together in about 15 minutes or so and the AEON model took me about an additional 5 minutes.OVERALL : Overall this Echogear is a good tv stand and I will not be returning this model . But my personal preference is the AEON for the appearance, larger base, and additional height under tv . I&rsquo;d give the Echogear a 4.1 star and the AEON a 4.7 star.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great and stable stand for my older tv that had was missing a stand after having been wall mounted for years. The installation guide had me cracking up which made the experience even more enjoyable. This company has a great sense of humor and I enjoyed that extra special creative touch. Who knew putting together a stand could be so fun? Lol!</p>

<h5 id="very-sturdy-stand">Very Sturdy Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stand worked perfect on my 55&rdquo; LED TV. I wanted a stand with a metal base, not tempered glass like most have. I drilled a hole in the back of the base and bolted it down, so it could not be tipped over. I know they make tether straps for this but then you can&rsquo;t swivel the TV easily. This way I can swivel the TV to the front of my recliner to watch football.</p>

<h5 id="not-used-as-intended">Not used as intended.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, where do I start, I was looking for a stand that could be assembled back to front. It took me a very long time to check all the individual specs of a lot of products on Amazon. I have a built in tv niche that could not accommodate my larger tv and I could not find a well priced hanging wall stand that would cover 27-inch depth. This stand is a financial win. I assembled the stand back to front and aligned the short front end to the built-in edge. I then drilled 3 holes in the metal base and bolted the stand to the built in cabinet. Then hung the tv and it is not going anywhere. I do understand that this can only be done if you have a very sturdy table or built-in, I have also installed a safety strap (totally unnecessary but I had bought the strap already.On the photo, you can see the back 2 front assembly. The niche is 37 inches wide and our tv is 41 inches wide. The tv now hangs flush with the front of the cabinet.The stand comes with all the screws for all different TVs and some extenders for curved/not straight TVs..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit our Samsung 55&rdquo; KS8000 perfectly and set up was a breeze. Had all parts we needed and so much better than the leg stands original TV came with which were almost too wide for the furniture we already had. Plus this offers swivel which is great!Great purchase</p>

<h5 id="great-product-and-tremendous-customer-service">Great product and tremendous customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for use with a Samsung UN55KS8000. I had to have a stand because I have a ZVOX Soundbase that the TV would sit on, and with the way the legs were oriented on the TV, it would not fit on top of the Soundbase. When looking at reviews for this product, I found several reviews that said that the bolts that came with the Echogear TV Stand were not long enough for this TV. I also saw a review where someone had said that, if you contact Echogear, they will send the bolts to you free of charge. So, after ordering the TV stand, I sent a message to Echogear, and they promptly followed up and said they would send out the bolts I needed. To my surprise, when I got the package from Echogear, it was a kit that had ever conceivable size bolt imaginable. And, as it turned out, I actually needed a bolt of a different size than an earlier reviewer had said you needed for this TV, and fortunately, that bolt was in the package sent by Echogear. So, thank you Echogear for making this work for me. Plus, the installation was simple, and works great for this TV. It is very stable feeling, and I love that it swivels so I don&rsquo;t have to move the base when turning the TV. Very well made and thought out design. Great product and exceedingly excellent customer service. I would definitely do business with them again.</p>

<h5 id="good-but-needs-more-screws">Good, but needs more screws.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received and installed this base. It seems very well built and looks really good. The swivel function works perfectly and was really easy to assemble. With the stand height adjusted all the way up I was able to install my sound bar underneath the TV which is a nice bonus. However, the screws included would not work to install my Samsung UN55KS8000 with the factory Samsung spacers. To install this correctly, you need 4 M8 X 45mm screws. Unfortunately, the kit comes with 4 M8 X 35mm screws. Way too short. So if your buying this for this model Samsung, you&rsquo;ll need to go to the local hardware store and spend some more money.</p>
