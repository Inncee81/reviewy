<h5 id="worked-well-on-a-rented-kayak-trip">Worked well on a rented kayak trip</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great with a rented kayak. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I was going to mount a GoPro on a rental. I wanted to take a continuous time lapse video while on a several hour kayak/brewery event. Gives a unique (good or bad depending on what you want) view. You will see you arms and paddle in the video.When walking around between breweries, the harness worked great and was very stable, as long as you don&rsquo;t mind people asking you why you have a GoPro strapped to your chest!The harness mount has a clip that allows you to remove the camera from the chest harness. Once I realized the rental kayak already had a matching base already screwed into it, I removed the camera and attached it directly to the front of the kayak for a different perspective.Overall, a nice product. Comfortable enough to wear (Im a big guy). Works great because it is attached to your chest, which does not rotate as you turn your head.</p>

<h5 id="i-tried-it-at-different-levels-on-my-chest-before-finding-the-right-height-to-minimize-bicycle-pedaling-movement-and-get-the-bes">I tried it at different levels on my chest before finding the right height to minimize bicycle pedaling movement and get the bes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this chest mount when I ordered GoPro Hero 4 Silver. I made my very first movie with it on my bicycle. I tried it at different levels on my chest before finding the right height to minimize bicycle pedaling movement and get the best view of the trail. I didn&rsquo;t even have to adjust the buckles, I just positioned it and it stayed where I put it. The elastic is very comfortable and very stretchy yet it stays put. I think this would fit anyone because the elastic is so stretchy and the buckles give even more roominess if needed. For my cycling movie, I wore the whole harness tilted upward so the camera was about 6 inches below my chin. It probably looked uncomfortable but it was perfect and I even forgot I was filming. Very lightweight. GoPro attaches securely.</p>

<h5 id="quality-low-price-harness">Quality, Low Price Harness</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to film a nerf war that my college campus does. I bought this harness because it was cheaper and highly reviewed. I&rsquo;m glad I did. It arrived quickly and safely and is very easy to use. It&rsquo;s comfortable and can easily be worn by people of many sizes or over bulky clothing such as winter jackets. It didn&rsquo;t slide around or ride up and gave me some great footage.I haven&rsquo;t put it through the ringer just yet so I&rsquo;m not sure how it would hold up to, say, a BMX fall or something but it seems sturdy from my use.My only complaint is specific and very minor &ndash; I&rsquo;d love if the mounting bracket stuck out a bit more. Being so close to the chest piece means you get the widest angle possible, but it also means you&rsquo;re going to get a low angle if you&rsquo;re using the battery pack or LCD screen attachments with the GoPro. I had to remove my detachable screen because it was forcing the camera to point too far downward.That&rsquo;s a minor gripe, though, and I&rsquo;m happy with the harness. I&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good, comfortable harness that won&rsquo;t blow their budget.</p>

<h5 id="a-little-side-to-side-motion-in-video-but-i-m-a-fall-line-skier-so-it-isn-t-bad-at-all">A little side to side motion in video but I&rsquo;m a fall line skier so it isn&rsquo;t bad at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used for skiing. I&rsquo;m tall and ski the trees out west so am paranoid a branch will take off my GoPro, much more secure and out of the way on my chest. A little side to side motion in video but I&rsquo;m a fall line skier so it isn&rsquo;t bad at all, and better then the swaying you get mounted on the head. Basic construction, worked great over my jacket, once adjusted easy to put on and take off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-responsive-vendor-solid-product-at-good-price">Highly Responsive Vendor, Solid Product at Good Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I must say that I was incredibly impressed with their responsiveness to questions about the fit. In fact, they sent me a replacement with no questions asked on the the off chance that the original product had a defect. These are the types of vendors with which customers want to do business. Top of the line vendor. As for the frame itself, you have to be careful when you place the camera inside because the front side of the frame, into which the camera is placed, contains a thin rim (presumably to secure it when in place) that can get make things a bit tricky. I found I had to bend the frame a fair amount to avoid the rim getting caught on the corners of the camera frame. However, I did a test with GoPro&rsquo;s own frame and it presents the same issue. So it is by no means a deal killer, but a little finesse can help you avoid cosmetic damage to the camera. Once on, the frame works splendidly, and I find it particularly useful with the suction mount. Save yourself some money and go with this vendor&rsquo;s product rather than the considerably more expensive GoPro. Moreover, the vendor stands behind its products, so if you should have any complaints, you can expect a prompt and satisfying response.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-really-good">It&rsquo;s really good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This chest mount is as good at the GoPro one. It&rsquo;s way less expensive and it comes with everything the GoPro chest mount would come with. I totally recommend buying this one over the GoPro one. The only different between this one and the GoPro one is that the GoPro one has the logo on it. That&rsquo;s the only different I could tell. It comes with everything in the picture except the GoPro of course and it&rsquo;s really good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This chest mount works great. It has allowed my son to mount his go pro and use it while bike riding, or motor cycle riding. It does not fall out or move, it stays in place and allows for recording great videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-chest-harness-for-gopro">Excellent Chest Harness for GoPro!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an extremely well made chest harness. The material is heavy enough to be durable and long-lasting. There are adjusters to adjust the shoulder straps and the chest to get the perfect fit. The material is also elastic enough to get a snug fit and keep the harness in place. The mount for the GoPro is a sufficently heavy metal plate together with a GoPro adapter that allows some additional adjustment. Everything is included that is necessary for you to mount your GoPro with skeleton onto the harness. I am very impressed with the quality and durability of this harness. Fast shipping and great price as well!!!</p>
