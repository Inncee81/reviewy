Choose Right Antenna</p>

<p>Choose the Right Antenna</p>

<p>Check the distance from the house to the nearest broadcast towers to choose the right antenna, and pls check how many available channels in your area on antennapoint website.</p>

<p>The number of channels you get is determined by what&rsquo;s being broadcast in your area, how far away you are from the towers, and your surroundings.</p>

<p>Warm tip:</p>

<p>If the distance from your house to the nearest tower is less than 30miles, but you bought the 50miles antenna with amplifier, pls do not connect the amplifier and test at first. Because, in some instances, the amplifier may cause self-oscillation, which may interfere with the signal.

<h5 id="and-couldn-t-be-happier-we-pick-up-the-main-three-or-four">and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. We pick up the main three or four &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Soberer TV Amplifier for four or five months now, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. We pick up the main three or four local channels that allow us to see the news, and we were able to watch the Summer Olympics without any trouble. The channels come in with great quality on our 47&rdquo; TV. The amplifier picks up a lot of other useless channels, but we just wanted it for the local ones since we watch Netflix mostly. For the price, you can&rsquo;t beat it. Easy to install, works immediately. One thing you have to do is run a channel search on your TV which might take five or ten minutes, but I just let it run while I was doing chores, and the TV did it&rsquo;s thing.One thing to add is that we live downtown in a city. I&rsquo;m not sure how this product will work in more rural areas, but it definitely worked great for us.</p>

<h5 id="i-simply-hooked-it-up-to-my-32-vizio-smart-tv-and-ran-a-channel-scan">I simply hooked it up to my 32&rdquo; Vizio smart tv and ran a channel scan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this antenna yesterday and it works exactly as advertised. The product arrived on time and without damage. I simply hooked it up to my 32&rdquo; Vizio smart tv and ran a channel scan. I now receive 37 channels from the Orlando viewing area, ranging from 1080p, 740p and 420. I might add I live on my sailboat and it is receiving quite well through the thick fiberglass hull. The antenna is mounted above a port in my cabin with the supplied tape. For the price I don&rsquo;t think you can find a better, smaller, indoor antenna. It compliments my sling tv nicely. Hope everyone gets a positive idea of this product from my review.</p>

<h5 id="worthless-product-worthless-customer-support">Worthless product, worthless customer support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Moved to a new house and the FCC website says I should get PBS for the kids to watch but wasn&rsquo;t getting it with my old antenna. The tower is about 25-30 miles away, so thought maybe the signal needed to be amplified. Hooked up this amplified antenna and noticed absolutely no difference between this and my old leaf antenna. Contacted the company, they suggested that maybe I was too close to the tower. For a company that deals with radio signals, they should probably have a better idea how radio waves work. No way is 25 miles too close for TV broadcast. When I told them I wanted a refund and they promptly stopped responding.</p>

<h5 id="genuinely-surprised-at-how-well-this-antenna-works">Genuinely surprised at how well this antenna works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am genuinely surprised at how well this antenna works. I researched antennas a bit before taking a chance on this particular one. The Lightning Deal price was low enough to take it as a loss if the antenna didn&rsquo;t work. We got rid of TV service close to 4 years ago and have been relying on a home made antenna built from a 2 x 4 and metal hangers. It worked well but it is one ugly looking thing (Google it). The Sobetter TV antenna is compact and came very well packaged. I was even more doubtful that it would work after a quick look at it.Installation was as easy as unplugging the old antenna and connecting the new one. During installation I opted to not use the included amplifier. I used the included double sided sticker to &lsquo;hide&rsquo; the antenna behind the TV. Next, I did a channel search just to make sure the antenna was in a good location.I live about 30 miles from downtown Denver and the 50 mile range was an important feature for me. The Sobetter antenna performed well and found more than 50 channels. It did much better than the old hanger antenna. The channels come in well and most of them come in HD. I have not had poor reception since installation. I used an antenna transmitter locator and all the channels within the 35 mile range were found by the Sobetter antenna and most of the 50 mile range were also found.I would definitely recommend this antenna to friends and family. I am completed satisfied with the performance, the compact size, and the ease of installation.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-indoor-hd-antenna">Perfect indoor HD antenna</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This antenna works great had no issues at all and I was surprised by that do to its size! Easy to hide behind anything and still get a great signal. Used the enclosed booster and found the sweet spot in den. I get all the channels I am supposed to get for the area I live in. No issues installing it at all. Very pleased with this Antenna so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-very-well-and-can-be-powered-from-the-tv-for-the-amplifier">Works very well, and can be powered from the TV for the amplifier.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this because the local TV station, a NBC affiliate, is doing battle with both Satellite companies. They have already been dropped by one and I bet they will be dropped by the other soon. If I want to watch NBC, I have to go around the Satellite companies.I was able to use a USB port from the TV which puts outputs 0.5A [500mA] as the Sobetter needs only 0.05A [50mA]. I attached the antenna to the window and instantly scanned over 50 HD Channels. Unfortunately, where I live, most are in Spanish [South Florida] but that&rsquo;s not the antenna fault. Overall, I&rsquo;m very happy with the antenna, it&rsquo;s actually exceeding my expectations.For the price, this was a really good purchase.</p>

<h5 id="supper-high-reception-with-amplifier">Supper high reception with amplifier !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried severals hdtv antennas before, so i suggested to track how far the station from your address, choose the right miles range one would better than higher miles range one. my address would be a little far from the station so I chose the 50 miles antenna with amplifier. sobetter inc&rsquo;s antenna has supper hige reception than my old one, and I got 46 channels max with this one! Deserved to rank on top 20, recommend !!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cut-the-cord">Cut the cord!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised. I bought 8 of these antenna, 5 white and 3 black ones and they all work as intended.Pros:*They are small and can be hidden*Range extender lights up read letting you know it&rsquo;s on*double side tape is strong and can easily adhere to the wall/windowsCons:*Could use the 4G interference blocker*this unit is directional, if your area has multiple towers then you might have to choose one over the others like I had toCaveat: reception is all based on where you locate the antenna, on my Patio I can pick up all the channel clearly without glitch, in some rooms of the house I can not pick up a few channels, if I relocate the antenna then I give up other channels. So I chose the ones I will likely watch more.For the cost of $20 per TV, I consider this a great value and easily justify the cost of cutting the cord. If your sick of paying crazy cable bills for only a few usable channel then this is a great alternative. I primary use this for football that is air by my local stations and news, everything else I stream off Amazon or the internet.</p>
