<h5 id="best-sounding-and-fit-of-the-bunch">Best sounding and fit of the bunch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Of all of the other blue tooth headphones I&rsquo;ve tested in the $100 to $150 price range, these are the best sounding and have the best fit. For reference I only use Bluetooth ear buds for working out and use Beats Studio wireless over the ear headphones for around the house listening.Back to the ear buds. I&rsquo;ve tried the Bose Soundsport wireless but the ear piece was heavy and it always felt as if it were falling out o my ear. I&rsquo;ve tried Beats Powerbeats 3 but I don&rsquo;t like the over the ear hook as it tends to just dangle after a while especially if I&rsquo;m running or jumping rope. Both above mentioned sound good as long as the bud is in the ear. I&rsquo;ve also tried the Monster iSport Superslim which sound the worst with tinny sound, but they have an OK fit.However the Jabra Sport Coach has a solid sound, good bass, clear but not tinny, and they stay in the ear very well. They also come with more size attachments than the others.My only complaint is I&rsquo;m on my third pair in three years. It seems to know exactly when the warranty expires and they die right after a year. However, when shopping for this third pair I again tried all the above and returned all of them. The Jabra Sport is still the best in my book.</p>

<h5 id="just-ok">Just OK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The piece of junk fabric carrying pouch they ship with the product is shameful and offers no protection for a $120 pair of headphones. It came apart at the seams after two months. I contacted Jabra and they said they could not replace it but sent me a link to BUY a better case. Really, Jabra?Had to update the firmware right out of the box which was a pain. You have to download the update to a computer and plug the headphones in, run the installer, etc. I&rsquo;m not sure why they can&rsquo;t update wirelessly from the phone.Otherwise, decent wireless headphones and they&rsquo;re easy to pair. The bass is less bassy than I&rsquo;d hoped it would be but good enough for working out. Comes with different sizes of silicone and memory foam fittings, so you can pick the most comfortable size for you. Personally I feel that even the largest ones could be a little more snug.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Product, fit is perfect, sound is even better. Battery life is a bit short, 3 hr-ish</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="music-does-just-fine-but-the-minute-a-call-comes-in">music does just fine, but the minute a call comes in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got these despite the small number of negative reviews about call issues. Well, they were right, music does just fine, but the minute a call comes in, the sound starts breaking up and the person on the other end cannot hear you. To bad. Spend the money for Bose. Update for 4/4/2017: So I followed the manufacture comment on this post and did the reset and updated the firmware. Now calls are clear on both ends so the combo of great sounding music and good calling, warrants a significant revision of my rating. I possibly over-reacted as this was the second set (not as expensive and I fell for a good advertising line). I therefore upgrade my rating to a 4 until I see how its battery and quality.</p>

<p>Excelentes! Gracias</p>

<p>Works great!</p>

<h5 id="average-sound-great-noise-isolation">Average sound, great noise isolation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have mixed feelings about these. Sound wise with music they are lacking compared to other ear buds or headphones I own. The sound is not terrible. it is just not that great. Noise cancelling is great with these. very similar to my Etymotic 4P&rsquo;s which also use passive noise cancelling as these sit more in the ear and block out most sound. I used these while listening to music and cutting my lawn on my tractor and I could barely hear the tractor.As for coaching, I have a tried a few of the exercises with the app and they are Ok but I prefer to follow routines like Focus T25 and PX90x. I get more motivation with those than I do with the coach.I did have a hard time finding the right fit ear pieces. I am currently using the middle size foam ones which seem to stay in place ok but they are not easy to put in. Once in, they are comfortable and stay in place for the most part. The cable does get a bit annoying at times as it is a bit short for me and tends to hit the collar of my shirt at times. The buttons are hard to adjust when you are wearing them since you cannot see what you are doing.As for Bluetooth, like every other pair I own, these also cut out from time to time which I find annoying. It is why I still own and want to use wired headphones.Overall, not bad. But not great.** I downgraded my star rating to two stars after using these a bit longer. First, battery life is horrible. I tried using these to listen to music during the workday but the battery won&rsquo;t last more than 3 or 4 hours max. Second, sound quality is just not there. At louder volumes, these headphones just create a mush of sound and any detail is completely lost. Definitely not in my top 20 for music based applications. Third, pairing these with my Iphone has become a nuisance. While the actual pairing was easy, getting them to register on my phone takes two attempts every single time. I have to turn them on and then off and then on again. I have tried to manually select them from the Bluetooth area on my phone but they will not connect without repeating the process.Overall, a big eh&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-for-me-in-terms-of-fit-and-sound-didn-t-care-about-the-app-and-coaching">Good for me in terms of fit and sound, didn&rsquo;t care about the app and coaching</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a pair of sports headphones for walking and my solo yoga practice. I can sweat a fair amount, hence the sports model. There is nothing on the app that applies to my situation so I am fine without the coaching. I can say that properly fit the ear buds stay in place during inversions which is a huge plus.Take time to get the correct fit with these. I assumed the medium would fit me but was far better served with the small set up. I found the sound very crisp. I was playing some of my digitized music from the 70s and could hear fingers on guitar strings very clearly. I do feel that I had to have the volume up pretty high to hear well and I have normal hearing.As of this month my company is allowing us to wear earbuds at our desk. I like that I can hear people around me through the ear buds. I startle easily and hate people coming up behind me. My biggest quibble was with the website and less than useful instructions got this product. The site is very busy and it isn&rsquo;t all that easy to find what you are looking for. Overall, these are, for me, very comfortable wireless headphones that meet my needs well.</p>

<h5 id="when-it-works-i-love-it-when-it-partially-works-its-the-more-irritating-pair-of-headphones-ever">When it works, I love it, when it partially works its the more irritating pair of headphones ever.</h5>

<p>These are probably the most frustrating set of earphones I&rsquo;ve ever owned.I love them when they work, but I just had my second set fail in under two years and I can&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing">Disappointing&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had another pair of Jabra headphones. The battery died after about two years. On this model the battery life is terrible and the ear wing supports come off easily and get lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Way too expensive and doesn&rsquo;t block noise out. I had trouble keeping the blue tooth connection as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disposable-product">Disposable Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these headphones last January and for no reason they just wouldn&rsquo;t charge anymore . They simply died.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">do not buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these headphones after reading negative reviews about them not working and chose to give them a chance anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-sound-and-perfect-fit">Excellent sound and perfect fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a review that looks at the coach app, you will be disappointed, since I had no interest in using it.</p>

<h5 id="handfree-sound-made-carefree">Handfree sound made carefree</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This headset fits comfortably behind your neck and provided excellent sound. Perfect for exercise and hand free use.</p>
