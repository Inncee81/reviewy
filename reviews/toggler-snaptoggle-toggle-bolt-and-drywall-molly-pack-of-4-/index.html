<h5 id="very-sturdy-on-drywall-if-installed-correctly-using-2-to-hold-bicycles-up-to-30-lbs-works-great-haven-t-tested-heavier">Very sturdy on drywall if installed correctly. Using 2 to hold bicycles up to 30 lbs, works great. Haven&rsquo;t tested heavier.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered from the AV company, not the other one. Came with the full kit as advertised, and arrived on-time. Works great to hold up my bikes using a hook system on drywall. Very sturdy. Note that you do have to make a sizable hole in the drywall to stick this through, but if you make the hole too big you&rsquo;ll have to rely on what you&rsquo;re screwing onto the wall for the support on the visible side.Installation tips:(1) You will need a drill to make a sizable hole in the wall (around a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; squared, maybe a tad bigger).(2) Making the hole big enough for the metal part is not big enough for the end plastic piece to go in flush against the wall. You should make it so the metal piece fits in both ways (like a + sign, or square) to make sure the circular plastic piece can fit in flush against the wall.(3) Don&rsquo;t make the hole too big or the end plastic piece will be loose on the visible side of the wall (or go in&hellip; don&rsquo;t want that!).(4) Make sure the zip is pulled completely before breaking off the excess plastic, with the metal part and end plastic piece fully connecting to the wall on both sides&hellip; or it will be loose with no way of fixing it.</p>

<h5 id="these-worked-perfectly-we-had-to-mount-a-49">These worked PERFECTLY! We had to mount a 49&rdquo; &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These worked PERFECTLY! We had to mount a 49&rdquo; flat screen on a wall that has literally NO studs in it! We live in an apartment that has concrete exterior walls and ceiling so I GUESS they didn&rsquo;t have to put studs on the interior walls?! I have no idea why that is but I was very nervous to put this TV up, to say the least! The last thing i wanted was the tv falling on my toddler so I had no problem trying to rip this thing off the wall to make sure it would hold the TV and it did! It was not budging! Been up for weeks and I feel much more confident with it up there than on any cabinet, anchored or not, for the sake of my toddler AND my tv!</p>

<h5 id="don-t-let-your-studs-be-the-boss-of-where-you-place-things-on-your-walls">Don&rsquo;t let your studs be the boss of where you place things on your walls!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to mount my televisions on the walls of my new home, but exactly where I wanted to place them didn&rsquo;t always agree with stud placement within the walls. My brother told me about Toggler Snaptoggles and told me installation would be a breeze. I have <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; drywall and chose the size of Toggler meant to handle multiple times the weight of my TV and its hanging device because I knew that the greater the distance the TV was extended from the wall, it effectively weighed more than a static, wall hugging arrangement. I&rsquo;d used a variety of anchors for drywall and masonry before, and have been pretty disappointed-I had my doubts and pricey electronics at stake.My brother made these sound like miracle products that a blindfolded animal without opposable thumbs could apply in short order. I&rsquo;m very pleased to find that he wasn&rsquo;t exaggerating-much! My Togglers were, I think, repackaged from bulk and came quickly, but without instructions. I found the manufacturers website, read up on them and watched the tutorial videos. They were exceedingly easy to install and are really innovative! I&rsquo;m a perfectionist fuss-pot type and it took many hours of calculations, measurements, and even making a template so that the televisions would rest exactly, &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo; where I wanted them. (This gal&rsquo;s got priorities, after all!) Once I drilled the holes in the drywall, I inserted the Togglers, leveled them, and snugged them in very tightly just like I saw in the video. Super easy and the first TV took about 20 minutes to hang&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m a little slow and deliberate. Second TV was up faster and they&rsquo;ve been up for over a year and a half, with mild seismic activity in the first year (wall shaking/cracking construction nearby), wide variations in weather and temperature-both TV&rsquo;s are mounted on outside walls, and the TV mount bolts are as tight and secure as the day they went in! No wall damage, no problems and I&rsquo;ve used these since to affix other heavy things to drywall in full confidence!I think the maker merged with another company but just search for the site using Toggler Snaptoggle and you will find a chart to help you calculate which size you need based on the weight of the item, the thickness of your drywall or wall construction, and how many bolts you will use. You&rsquo;ll find lots of helpful information, and if you&rsquo;re like me, your faith in wall anchors will be renewed!</p>

<h5 id="strong-and-flexible">Strong and flexible.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use, bigger than you need for most drywall hanging jobs but we were hanging a kitchen shelf so this was just the trick. Long enough to accommodate any imaginable wall thickness, or just snaps off to any size after installation if you don&rsquo;t need all that depth. Seemingly well engineered for its intended purpose. More than adequately packaged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried to install these in a ceiling for my projector. 2 out of the 4 broke during installation. I&rsquo;ve installed hundreds of these before and I think these were just old or dried out.</p>

<h5 id="togglers-are-fantastic-these-not-so-much">Togglers are fantastic, these&hellip;..not so much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Half of my 4 pack are now lost forever inside my wall. 2 of the togglers had bad threads. I did not notice the first until it was in the wall. The 2nd I chased the threads and all was well. Then I had mess up threads on a screw break off the other. I used a hand screw driver to on them and still had these issues.I have used hundreds of togglers when I was marine electronics installer. These lack the quality control of those</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i recently just bought this product hoping using it to mount my TV to a metal stud wall, but when i open up the package i noticed that it only came with the toggle, no screws or washers were included. the product description said &ldquo;4pcs kit SNAPTOGGLE® <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-20 toggle bolt, Grip Range <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> to 3 <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch. Includes 2.5 inch screws and washers.&rdquo; but there were no screws or washers. disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="i-purchased-8-of-these-and-5-broke-when-trying">I purchased 8 of these and 5 broke when trying &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased 8 of these and 5 broke when trying to install. The plastic breaks off at the wrong point and the toggle falls behind the sheetrock. I was able to get one shelf bracket up and it is very secure but getting them in place is difficult. Considering the cost of these, I very much regret this purchase.</p>
