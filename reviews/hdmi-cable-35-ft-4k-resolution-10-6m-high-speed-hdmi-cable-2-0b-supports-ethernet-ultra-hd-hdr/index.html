<h5 id="i-have-had-trouble-with-other-cables-getting-a-good-consistent-signal-to-my-three-hdmi-high-def-tvs">&hellip; I have had trouble with other cables getting a good consistent signal to my three HDMI high def TVs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At 40 feet I have had trouble with other cables getting a good consistent signal to my three HDMI high def TVs. These work great and give me all of the extra features of a &ldquo;smart TV&rdquo; that I wanted. I highly recommend them as an economical, quality answer long run cabling. Don&rsquo;t try multiple shorter- run .cables. You are doomed to failure.</p>

<h5 id="the-information-basically-says-that-good-cables-will-definitely-work-up-to-about-40-feet">the information basically says that good cables will &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; work up to about 40 feet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 40&rsquo; long version of the Ultra cable for an &ldquo;In wall / in ceiling&rdquo; application, and I needed every last inch of it. If you look online at the various testing that has been done of HDMI cables, the information basically says that good cables will &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; work up to about 40 feet, and will &ldquo;most likely&rdquo; work at somewhat longer distances. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk things, so I purchased the shortest cable I could possibly have.The quality is excellent, and I have no signal issue over the 40-foot length. The only thing that I will point out as a potential &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo;: At the widest point, the vinyl/rubber behind the HDMI connector is <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; of an inch wide. That is pretty huge. The place where I had to run my cables required that I drill a couple of new holes through my basement ceiling, and it was in a very awkward location; barely within reach of the drill with my arm fully extended. I drilled these holes prior to the arrival of the Ultra cable, and I drilled them at <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; diameter &ndash; after all, no HDMI cable could possibly be more than <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; wide, could it? Apparently it can. I could not realistically go back and drill bigger holes, so instead I filed about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; of the vinyl off of the widest part of the HDMI cable. Problem solved. Just be aware that these are pretty &ldquo;meaty&rdquo; connectors if you have any in-wall holes you need to pass the cables through.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-hdmi-solution">Perfect HDMI Solution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased a new 4K tv for my living room. I have all of my equipment in a cabinet behind me and the TV is across the room from the equipment. I needed a cable this long to get from the equipment cabinet to the TV. This filled the bill nicely. It works well. I have had absolutely no problem with it. Also, like the fact that it is white as it is not so noticeably along the woodwork. I had a sales person from Best Buy tell me a cable this long would never work well unless I spent a fortune on it. Apparently, he didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about. This is a reasonably prices cable that delivers. I would recommend it to anyone who has a similar situation to mine.</p>

<h5 id="4k-chroma-subsampling">4k Chroma Subsampling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this 40 foot HDMI with hopes to link my computer with a GTX 960 in one room with my LG 65UF7700 in another room.The good:I was able to pass UHD 4K @ 60hz with 4:2:0 sub-sampling.I have no problems using this with a Vivitek Qumi Q5 Projector @ 720p 120hzThe cable feels extremely solid and the termination ends are neither too loose or too tight.The white cable jacket is less obtrusive to run over the wall.I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate running this through a wall.The bad:As of 9/24/2015 no known current cables over 35 feet are able to pass 4:4:4 chroma, including this one. The one that can at 35ft is silver coated ($$$) and is very YMMV.</p>

<h5 id="great-price-solid-quality-and-a-great-seller-standing-behind-it">Great price, solid quality, and a great seller standing behind it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought several of these and got one that may have been dead out of the box or it may have been damaged when I fished it through my wall to my TV.I didn&rsquo;t test the cables before I fished them through my wall and I was honest with the manufacturer about that.They processed my return with no questions asked and all of the cables have been working perfectly with no signal loss for over 6 months now.5 stars, I&rsquo;ll buy these again!</p>

<p>Arrived on-time and well-packaged. Signal seems fine as compared with image on tv&rsquo;s in the house with much shorter HDMI cables. I would buy this again if needed and recommend it to friends and family.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-looks-slightly-different-than-picture">Works great, looks slightly different than picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ran this cable through the walls to extend my living room HD cable/DVR output to a TV in the basement via a HDMI 2.0 splitter. It&rsquo;s working great. This item was pictured as having red stripes all along the cable, but mine is solid white with a red stripe just on the plugs at each end.</p>

<h5 id="you-can-tell-the-pioneers-by-the-arrows-in-their-backs">You can tell the pioneers by the arrows in their backs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Amazon purchase and shipping experience was very good. This product was technically described in detail, where others omitted significant details on compliance with HDMI 2.0 and 60 frames per second, which will be important over the comes years, but not detectible in most installations. Therefore the manufacturers integrity is most important at this time.Does it work on 4K at 60fps? I don&rsquo;t know. I have an extremely well equipped iMac 2015 and it choked on the process of putting video and audio on the TV screen. Lots of connectivity problems. Apple tech said to try their Thunderbolt 2 to HDMI rather than the one I had. It got worse.So here is the irony, it would appear the cable is transmitting more information, and that additional information is troubling my Mac. Seriously, they downloaded operational data and working on it in engineering.My guess is that the cable is as advertised. And you need to know that HDCP will be much effective; meaning it will interfere with you watching a movie or music because the legacy devices cannot talk, and it thinks it is pirated material when it is not. Every device in the chain of digital devices have to be compliant, and they are not. We are in the wilderness and you need to expect problems.</p>
