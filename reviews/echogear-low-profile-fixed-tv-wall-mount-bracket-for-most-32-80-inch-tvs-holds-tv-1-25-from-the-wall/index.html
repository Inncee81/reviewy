<ul>
<li>Fits 32&rdquo; to 80&rdquo; TVs. Holds 150 lbs. Can time travel. Sits only 1.25&rdquo; from the wall. One of these is a lie, can you guess which one?</li>
<li>With a plethora of hardware, minimum assembly, and a blazing fast install, you&rsquo;ll be saying things like &ldquo;Wow, there is a plethora of hardware, minimum assembly, and a blazing fast install&rdquo;</li>
<li>Is there anything we didn&rsquo;t think of? Click lock security system with pull-string quick release makes it easy to ensure your TV is locked during installation and even easier to take the TV off the wall when needed.</li>
<li>A thin TV deserves a thin mount. Get a crisp, clean look with this mount that sits just 1.25 inches from the wall.</li>

<li><p>Wall plate allows compatibility with 16&rdquo; studs, 24&rdquo; studs, Brad Pitt studs (not too soon, he will be okay).</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Set it and forget it. The ultimate in easy TV mounting.</p>

<p>If you need a TV mounted in a single location that doesn&rsquo;t need to swivel or tilt this is the perfect mount for you.</p>

<p>Since it doesn&rsquo;t need to move, it has the lowest profile, so the mount is basically invisible on the wall. Your friends will think it&rsquo;s magically levitating when they come over, like Wingardium Leviosa. This type of mount also fits a wider range of VESA patterns, improving its compatibility with TV brands like Samsung, Vizio, and Sony.</p>

<p>Being so close to the wall does have one major drawback, it is hard to access your cables. Luckily, ours has pull cords to easily unlock the TV from the mount, to get at your cables without having to take the entire TV down, saving you time. And we all know that time is money, money is power, power is pizza, and pizza is knowledge.</p>

<p>Because the mount doesn&rsquo;t need to move, it is also the most budget friendly mounting option and the easiest to mount.</p>

<p>Here are the specs:
VESA Compatibility: 100x100, 200x100, 200x200, 300x200, 300x300, 400x200, 500x200, 300x300, 400x300, 400x400, 500x400, 600x400
Profile from Wall: 1.25&rdquo;
Lateral Shift?: Yes
Studs Required: 2
Wall Compatibility: 16&rdquo; or 24&rdquo; on Center Wood Studs &amp; Concrete
Construction: 100% High Grade Steel
Click Lock Security System
Favorite Movie: 21 Jump Street

<h5 id="echogear-low-profile-fixed-tv-wall-mount">ECHOGEAR Low Profile Fixed TV Wall Mount&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t realize this tv mount was two pieces for the main bracket. But, putting it together, there were no issues in mounting the bracket to the wall or the tv to the bracket. This wall mount works and the price was right. There is no adjustment options to this tv wall mount. I would recommend this tv wall mount if you don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of money and don&rsquo;t need to have it adjustable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="superior-product-at-a-resonable-price">Superior Product At A Resonable Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used a few TV mounts over the years, slim profile to fully articulating and different brands along the way (Monoprice, Cheetah, OmniMount, etc.). In considering the cost and quality of the product, along with installation instructions, process, ease of TV removal when mount (love the pull down straps option), ECHOGEAR very much impressed me with this mount.Not only was I impressed with all aspects of this mount, I&rsquo;ve even considered replacing one of my existing fully articulating mounts, which I currently don&rsquo;t have any issues with, simply to reduce it&rsquo;s footprint and based on my experience with this unit.Would highly recommend ECHOGEAR mounts based on my experience, superior product at a reasonable price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install">Easy to install!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is very easy to install. I have installed two of these on different television brands and worked out great. the package has variety of screws to fit almost any model of television to the mount. It was very easy to move the television to the wall mount and secure it. It was also very easy to take the television off the wall mount my pulling on the two cords to release. I did opt out of not using the huge lag screws included to mount to the wall, but instead used a 3&rdquo; long standard wood screw utilizing the washer included.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-super-low-profile-wall-mount">Fantastic super low profile wall mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The wall bracket comes in two pieces to allow it to fit in a smaller box but it&rsquo;s easy to assemble. The build quality is excellent. It&rsquo;s very low profile as I wanted which isn&rsquo;t an issue because my TV wall plate is recessed and conveniently located behind the TV so that I have all the access I need with a quick pull of the release tabs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="extremely-pleased-with-this-purchase">Extremely pleased with this purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with this purchase. I actually bought two of these, and they both went up relatively easy. ( I am NOT a mechanically oriented person.) I had originally bought a different brand, and after taking part of one unit out of the box, I decided they were way above my abilities to install; so I returned those two.Again, the Echogear tv wall mounts worked very well for my two new TV&rsquo;s.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-are-wondering-how-this-wall-mount-works-or-it-will-work-with-your-tv-read-my-review">If you are wondering how this wall mount works or it will work with your TV&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; read my review! :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FANTASTIC!!! If you are in the market for a frame bracket to hang your flat screen TV, then look no further! I was very impressed how well thought out this wall mount is. I chose the one that mounts the TV flat onto the wall, with NO tilt, NO articulating arm, NOTHING. Just flat against the wall. ECHOGEAR does offer other models of wall mounts that provide these capabilities.Everything that you will need to mount your TV onto a wood frame wall with 2X4, or any 2X framing is included with the one I ordered. If you are going to mount this onto a concrete wall, or a masonry wall, then you will need to furnish the anchors yourself. I am not sure if ECHOGEAR offers them with anchors instead for a wood frame wall.The wall mount allows you to anchor onto a 16&rdquo; or 24&rdquo; on center wall framing. The wall mount consists of 2 main sections: the square frame that goes on the wall, and the 2 vertical pieces. The two vertical pieces you see, that have the straps on the bottom, are what bolt onto the back of your TV. This kit comes with all the different bolt sizes that most TV&rsquo;s have on them. My TV is a 65&rdquo; Samsung LED TV. The kit also has some spacers that will allow you to place between the TV and the two vertical frame pieces that allow you to fur out or move the TV a little bit away from the wall. In addition, these spacers provide small clearance for the cords that connect to your TV. I did purchase a 6 piece HDMI kit that has different 90 degree elbows to turn down the cable, instead of coming straight out the back of the TV where this would introduce a clearance problem with the video cable would be interfering with the wall. Turning down the cable with a quick 90 degree connector solved this clearance problem for me. The rectangular frame piece is what bolts to the wall. The horizontal slots are what allow you to adjust the frame horizontally on your wall. Prior to any hole drilling or entry into the wall, I used a stud finder and a level to mark out the center of the studs and where the four holes will locate vertically and horizontally on the wall. The kit comes with four (4) <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; x 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; wood lag bolts and flat washers which I used after drilling a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; pilot hole in the center of the wood studs. I then drove them into the wall with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; impact gun.Once the square section frame is fastened to the wall, and the 2 vertical pieces are fastened to your TV, you can hang TV. The straps are level to pull down the spring loaded clips that lock your TV onto the square frame.I was unsure about purchasing this frame and read the previous reviews with almost all 5 star ratings. I am very glad and happy that I purchased this wall mount kit. I think you will as well.</p>

<h5 id="quality-wall-mount">Quality Wall Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great quality TV wall mount. It also comes with all necessary hardware which is also good quality. It&rsquo;s easy to install and it keeps the TV pretty flushed to the wall. I used it for our old Panasonic 42 inch Plasma TV. I had to pull the two halves of the bracket little away and I could only use two screws in top and bottom rows each to attach the two halves of the bracket, and yet it felt pretty solid. I had no trouble mounting the TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it">I love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this wall mount. Great price, very simple low profile fixed mount. Frame is well finished, no &ldquo;ginsu&rdquo; edges. Very substantial and sturdy, lots of mounting screws included for all kinds of different televisions and easy as can be to install. Latching pull strings are nice, made it easy to pull set off wall.Ran into a slight problem when centering the mount on wall. My TV is 70&rdquo; using 400x400 vesa pattern with 16&rdquo; center to center stud spacing. TV takes up virtually all available horizontal space on wall (61&rdquo; <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> TV vs. ~64&rdquo; wall) and so centering the mount perfectly was a major concern. Due to an unlucky stud configuration relative to center of wall it was not possible to mount in the center and horizontal slide action to compensate after TV was mounted came up a little over an inch short on allowing TV to be perfectly centered on wall. Still turned out great and TV does not extend past the wall edge so I&rsquo;m a happy camper.. Just wish this mount was two inches wider.</p>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-put-together">Very easy to put together</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was one of the easiest wall mount systems that I have set up. Very easy to put together. I installed into 2x4 studs in drywall.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-with-my-samsung-65-qled-q9f">Works great with my Samsung 65&rdquo; QLED Q9F</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works great with my Samsung QN65Q9 (65&rdquo; QLED Q9F TV) - the little straps that unlock the device from the wall are very helpful (my last wallmount had little screws underneath&hellip;</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-assemble-and-install">Easy to assemble and install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to assemble and install. I gave it 4 stars because the long bolts that attach the rack to the TV were too short. If you use the spacers you will need longer bolts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disappointed the concrete screws weren&rsquo;t included, otherwise the best brand in the business</p>

<h5 id="10-10-would-buy-again"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would buy again</h5>
