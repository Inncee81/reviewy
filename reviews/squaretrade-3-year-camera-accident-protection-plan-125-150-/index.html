<h5 id="the-customer-service-is-great-and-the-response-time-is-good">The customer service is great and the response time is good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use squaretrade for all my electronics warranties (I think I have around 10 warranties currently). The customer service is great and the response time is good. I&rsquo;ve had to use the warranty 5 separate times with three different phone contracts and everytime was great. There is also a points program which allows you to purchase warranties with the point accrues from purchases. I just redeemed points for a game console warranty. I will continue to purchase squaretrade warranties in the future.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-customer-service-with-absolute-resolution-when-my-camera-s-shutter-broke">AWESOME Customer Service with ABSOLUTE resolution when my camera&rsquo;s shutter broke!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve NEVER had a warranty service SO easy to work with!! The &lsquo;shutter button&rsquo; on my camera stopped working after having it a year. I called Square Trade customer service (spoke to an AWESOME rep), then rec&rsquo;d return instructions via email. I packed up my Nikon camera per Square Trade&rsquo;s instructions, returned with supplied &lsquo;prepaid&rsquo; Fed Ex label, and BOOM&hellip;.received my refund in 7 days&hellip;.via check today! I will NEVER&hellip;EVER&hellip; buy any electronic item WITHOUT Square Trade as the insurer!!</p>

<h5 id="refund-with-no-hassle">Refund with no hassle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this on a Lightdow LD6000 that I had for about one year. I let a friend borrow the camera, and when I got it back and tried to charge it, the metal around the USB port fell into the camera, rendering it impossible to charge.This was actually the second Lightdow LD6000, as I had previously damaged the lens on my first one, and got a refund using the Assurant plan that I had purchased.Anyway, I filed the claim, and didn&rsquo;t bother sending this camera back until over a month later. The tracking info never worked on the FedEx website, but the box still reached its destination the next day and I got my refund, which I am using to buy my third Lightdow LD6000 (and another protection plan, of course)!Hopefully I&rsquo;ll stop being so clumsy with these things!</p>

<h5 id="wow-highly-recommended">Wow! Highly recommended!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never EVER purchased an extended warranty or protection plan before but figured what the heck and opted for it on my ActionCam and I am so glad I did.The lens on my Action Cam got scratched and all my videos had a obnoxious blur where the scratch on the lens was.I went to the Square Trade website and filed a claim within a few minutes. A few hours later I got an email saying it was approved and got a fedex label e-mailed to me. A day after dropping it off (before the return was even delivered) I was e-mailed an Amazon gift card code for the full price of the camera.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This service worked great !! I purchased this plan for a small action cam that I was worried about dropping, well guess what ? Yep cracked the lens and cam would not power on. It took about 2mins to file a claim on there web site and 10mins after that I had a prepaid return label waiting in my inbox. What really made this nice was the next day I dropped the package off with FedEx and 10:45am an by 1pm that day I had a Amazon Gift card code for the amount of the camera.. Great Service</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a dozen or so items covered by SquareTrade. So far, I&rsquo;ve only had to make three claims, so they&rsquo;ve made a good chunk of change from me.Still, I don&rsquo;t mind it at all because they provide:➔ First class service. Calling in a claim is painless. They don&rsquo;t question you or give any indication that they doubt what you&rsquo;re saying.➔ Replacement comes next business day. My Samsung S3 went out. I was up and running the next day.➔ Full disclosure. You&rsquo;ll likely get a refurb. But I honestly could not tell. They look brand new to me.Concerns?Some people have issues with refurbs. But I weigh the pros and cons this way. By the time you make a claim, you item will be well used. If you claim is due to a drop or some incident where you&rsquo;re at fault, does it really make sense that you get a brand new replacement, especially given that the cost of your plan was a fraction of what the replacement cost would be?I&rsquo;m comfortable with the economics of that.</p>

<h5 id="relieves-a-lot-of-worry-great-protection">Relieves a lot of worry! Great Protection!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Glad to have this on some of our electronic products. Does not disappoint. The company advises you via regular US mail on several occasions to get yourself registered on-line so as not to lose out on technicalities of replacing or fixing your product. Good Job Square Trade. I found their staff to be gracious and helpful. They walked me through the procedure when I could not quite figure it out.</p>
