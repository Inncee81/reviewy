<h5 id="poor-manufacturing-deficient-in-tolerances">Poor manufacturing, deficient in tolerances.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the card with the hope to use it as a dual use type of device. Where, I will run the RaspberryPi and if needed will transport it on my android device.In terms of storage and compatibility, the card performed as expected. It booted Raspbian and I could also take pictures with my phone. GREAT. However, after exactly 6 times, where the micro SD was removed to be placed on the phone and back into the adapter for the Pi. The card was not being read at all, and I made sure not to jam the micro card or place it incorrectly. Therein, I eliminate any operation error.After careful inspection I found out that the SDadapter had slightly shifted open. Which is caused by the use CHEAP plastic and bad tolerances. With this shift, the adapter pins could not make proper contact with the microSD card and therefore it didn&rsquo;t worked.Now, I am using a competitor brand adapter and the microSD card still works well. Although I live in constant fear of a sudden malfunction and loose of all my data, specially the one originated from the RaspberryPi.Will update in regards of the performance of the microSD card.</p>

<h5 id="extra-capacity-for-gps-map-update">Extra capacity for GPS map update</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this flash card to provide additional capacity for my GPS device so I could upgrade my maps. Allow me to digress for a moment&hellip; I purchased a lifetime map update for my GPS about 4 years ago. The first couple of updates went off without a hitch, but last year I got an error message informing me I could only update part of the map due to storage limitations. Same thing this year, but much more extreme - I was only going to be able to get a regional map, which was not acceptable. Rather than succumb to the pressure to buy a new device, I purchased this flash card and was able to successfully complete my update. Hopefully this will be sufficient for a few more years. I know more people are using their smartphones for GPS these days, but since I already have the device, and don&rsquo;t want to burn through my data plan, this is a good option.</p>

<h5 id="not-sure-if-i-got-a-defective-sd-card-or">Not sure if I got a defective SD card or &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure if I got a defective SD card or not but after I take pictures I try to display them on the phone, sometimes the app locks up. Found out it is the SD card cuz I placed the SD card in my PC and I have a hard time reading the files. It took me over 8 hours to move the pictures to my desktop. I had several lockups of Windows explorer. After I retrieved most of the files I reformatted the SD card and will try it again in my phone. I was able to move the pix from PC to card without issue after the format. Maybe I fill up the card using the PC to ensure the card is ok before I trust it to store my phone pictures. I&rsquo;ve used Kingston memory chips in the past without issue but this one is flaky.</p>

<h5 id="i-bought-two-of-these-cards-and-they-passed-flash-test-repeatedly">I bought two of these cards and they passed Flash Test repeatedly.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Buying genuine microSD cards has become an absurd challenge and risk due to the abundant counterfeit microSDcards flooding the market. I have a small box full of worthless pseudo-microSD cards that I bought on eBay.Even the ones that are advertised as major brands and are in the packaging of major brands can be worthlesscounterfeits. The result is that a buyer has to run FLASH tests on every microSD card before accepting thepurchase and placing the microSD card in service.Please note that you need to run the flash test multiple times because one of the failure modes of thecounterfeit cards is to finish the test on the first pass, usually with recoverable errors, but then to failmassively on subsequent tests.I bought two of these cards and they passed Flash Test repeatedly.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-so-pleased-with-my-purchase">I am so pleased with my purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so pleased with my purchase! The price and reliability of this product is the best on the market. I will buy from this company again when I am in need of an SD card for sure.This is my own opinion of the product and yours may vary. I received no monetary compensation and I am not required to give a good review. I am not associated with the seller in any way.

<h5 id="dead-micro-sd-card-within-6-months-but-replacement-in-less-than-1-week">Dead Micro-SD Card within 6 months but replacement in less than 1 week.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Card worked great for 6 months but recently the card crashed and I lost some data I saved on the SD card. I was able to reformat the card ok but then this morning, it crashed again. These cards are only good for holding onto copies of data located on a real hard drive or in the cloud. Good luck with yours if you intend to buy one after reading my entry.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;5/12/2013 - An update to my previous listing. I have to commend Kingston on their Customer Service. After posting my earlier review on their 16gb MicroSD card, I received an email from Kingston stating that these cards have a LIFETIME WARRANTY. That&rsquo;s right, LIFETIME WARRANTY!! I called the Customer Service phone line in the email they sent me and discussed my problem with the representative on the line. They received a few bits of information from me regarding my Amazon purchase and gave me an RMA address to send my faulty 16gb MicroSD card and SD Card adapter. In a few days later, I received a brand new package with a 16gb MicroSD card and SD Card adapter. Now that is what I call service!! A company who stands by their product deserves an opportunity in the marketplace. Tnanks Kingston!!!</p>
