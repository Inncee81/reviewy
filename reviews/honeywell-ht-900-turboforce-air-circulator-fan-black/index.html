<h5 id="excellent-fan-with-a-single-glaring-con-for-those-young-at-heart">Excellent fan with a single glaring con,for those young at heart</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>let me start off by saying this: Before this fan I was sweating enough to get us out of the California drought. With this fan now I am cool as a cucumber I have not drippity drop dropped a single sweat in my room ever since I plopped this puppy on my desk.BUT..I cannot talk into the fan and distort my voice which really let down my inner 6 year old self.Still 5 stars, but for those of you looking to distort your voice by speaking into your new beloved table fan, look elsewhere. If the above doesn&rsquo;t apply to you stop reading this nonsense and buy the thing already!</p>

<h5 id="little-fan-moves-a-ton-of-air">Little fan moves a ton of air!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I bought this fan because our house does not have good circulation unless we are running the central air. We can open all the windows and air still doesn&rsquo;t seem to move. My wife and I also have a challenge because I need moving air to sleep and she cannot have any moving air or she gets an ear ache and headache! I read a little about air circulators and how they can move air around a room effectively, so I thought for $14 bucks I would make a minimal investment and give this a try. I found out very quickly that this tiny little fan can really move the stale air with very little noise. When I started it up on high speed, it didn&rsquo;t feel like it was moving a very impressive amount of air close up, but as I moved away 5, 10, 15, and 20 feet it seemed as if there was a concentrated cylinder of air moving in a vortex of sorts. I was pretty amazed. I placed this on the floor in the corner of our bedroom and aimed it at the ceiling toward the opposite corner of the room. It really moved the air around the room nicely without the violent blowing and noise of a box fan. For me, the moving indirect air is enough to keep me sleeping comfortably through the night and I hope that this indirect air doesn&rsquo;t end up giving my wife ear aches over the long haul. I have to believe this fan uses far less energy than the huge box fans that are clumsy and inefficient. I&rsquo;m sold on air circulators, and will probably pick up a few more for other rooms in the house. If this review, photos and video helped you, please let me know by clicking &ldquo;YES&rdquo; below. Thanks so much!PROS: moves a big vortex of air like I didn&rsquo;t expect, quiet, energy efficientCONS: NoneUPDATE: Because I was so satisfied with this product and its low price, I went and purchased a 2nd air circulator.</p>

<h5 id="comparison-to-the-chillout-fan">Comparison to the Chillout Fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you in the market for a $16 smallish fan? Then you are probably trying to decide between the Honeywell Chillout and the Honeywell TurboForce. I have both and like both, but both are suited for slightly different settings. In a nutshell, the Chillout pushes less air but has quieter operation (and a more pleasing tone, but that is subjective); and, the Honeywell has more options (tilt, 3 speed settings) and a more stable base (and as you can guess pushes more air with it&rsquo;s larger fan blades and is louder). So in the end you need to decide which fan will work better for you.Air Flow: Winner = Tie- (+1 Honeywell) Based upon my observations the Honeywell low setting produces airflow in between the low and high setting on the Chillout. The medium setting on the Honeywell gives more airflow than the high setting on the Chillout. The high setting on the Honeywell give more airflow than can be achieved by the Chillout.- (+1 Chillout) As a consequence of this, however, the Chillout allows you to have a truly low setting for those instances you just want a touch of airflow. The Honeywell is still pretty powerful at its lowest setting. For us, this comes in handy in our daughter&rsquo;s room. This way our baby monitor (audio only) is not overpowered by the strong gust/sound from the Honeywell. Now my daughter is allowed to use a fan overnight - with the Honeywell, we would shut it off before going to bed.Sound: Winner = Chillout- Chillout: 80 decibels (dB) directly in front of the fan, 70 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 45 dB about three feet to the side of the fan.- Honeywell: 80 dB directly in front of the fan, 75 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 50 dB about three feet to the side of the fan.- As I mentioned above, I fell the tone of the sound from the Chillout is closer to white noise, whereas the Honeywell motor overpowers the sound and is higher pitched. The Honeywell sound is not annoying, just louder and less pleasing (for those that like white noise).Stability: Winner = Honeywell- The Honeywell has a solid base that allows uniform distribution of weight across the entire base. It sits well in window sills with extended platforms in front.- The Chillout has a pair of feet in the front that is connected by a cross bar. The back is a fin similar to the front feet, but pointing backwards. The depth of the Chillout is slightly less than the Honeywell. I thought this might add to stability when used in a window sill or the platform in front of a window if you have one; however, I did not find this to be the case. I found that with the feet design, the Chillout has a more concentrated distribution of weight and therefore has a tendency to slip and fall to the side when used in situations that are not perfectly stable.- Case in point - our windows have platforms that sit in front of the window. They run about four and a half inches wide. The Honeywell sits on these with not problem despite extending about an inch or so beyond the platform. The Chillout, despite being only about a half inch beyond the platform, want to fall forward and off the platform because of the shape and position of the front feet and lack of other contact points. We have to use something underneath the fan to extend the effective platform width to keep the fan in place.This review is re-posted as a Chillout review.</p>

<h5 id="died-after-45-days">Died after 45 days.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It stopped working after 45 days. The websites talk about cleaning the motor and oiling it. If you have to open it every 45 days and oil the motor, it is junk. I have 2 other fans (different brand) that have been running for years with zero maintenance. This purchase was a mistake.</p>

<h5 id="it-does-what-it-says-it-will">It does what it says it will</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it to move hot air from the wood stove around the room. It&rsquo;s quiet enough not to have to turn up the tv in the same room, and it&rsquo;s been working for two winters now without a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sufficiently-silent">Sufficiently silent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Geez, half the reviews here complain this fan is too quiet, while the other half say it&rsquo;s not quiet enough. Didn&rsquo;t know who to believe, so I just took the plunge and ordered the bastard. My verdict? Not dead silent, but on the lowest of 3 speeds it&rsquo;s quiet enough to make me happy, and appreciably quieter than my former fan, a raucously loud Holmes Lil Blizzard. Some of the improvement is probably due to this fan having an 8&rdquo; diameter blade instead of 6&rdquo; (bigger blade = lower frequency noise), but still.Sound aside, this Honeywell HT-908 is physically stable, can tilt 90 degrees (straight up), and lives up to its self-description as a Whole Room Air Circulator (didn&rsquo;t realize &ldquo;fan&rdquo; needed marketing euphemisms) by doing a bang-up job of moving air across a bedroom even on its lowest setting. Overall, a pretty phat fan. If anyone cares, it&rsquo;s not a real Honeywell product, but made by some Massachusetts company called Kaz.PS - If you&rsquo;re in a cheap mood, note that the 6&rdquo; version (HT-900) retails for about half as much ($16 vs. $30).</p>

<p>Cools me well in this summer heat, it&rsquo;s quiet just like how it is described.</p>

<h5 id="dead-motor-after-2-months">Dead motor after 2 months.</h5>

<p>Owned for less than 2 months. Motor is ceasing. Very quiet fan but was never that powerful. Worst fan ive ever owned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quiet-and-effective">Quiet and effective.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Honeywell fans have been a staple in my house since I was a child. This is easily the quietest fan I&rsquo;ve ever had without sacrificing power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-simple-fan">Nice simple fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This the second fan I have purchased. They work amazingly with no problems. They are relatively quiet at first. As dust collects on the fans they tend to create a bit more noise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dead-after-12-months">Dead after 12 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lasted 12 months and then died. Great when it worked but that lifespan is horrible. Would advise against this item.</p>

<h5 id="great">Great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a lightweight fan, with 3 speeds. It is quiet and has great power. Good for travel, as well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-good">Works good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A good product, works well and light. I recommend this product if you need a fan in a room for circulating the air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-value">Outstanding Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very surprised at the output and how quiet these fans really are. I highly recommend these for home or business use.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little fan. Kind of wide, hence the four stars, but I&rsquo;d buy it again.</p>

<p>perfect for under my deck!</p>
