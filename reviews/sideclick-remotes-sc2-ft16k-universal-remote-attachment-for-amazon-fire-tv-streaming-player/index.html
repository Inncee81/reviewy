<p>Product Description
Sideclick is a slim universal remote attachment for streaming devices. A perfect accessory for cordcutters and streamers needing a simple universal remote to control your TV&rsquo;s basic functions and your streaming device all-in-on. Sideclick can be programmed over multiple devices (TV, sound bar, receiver, blu-ray) using IR learning technology. Great for kids, allowing them to access their streaming apps quicker and easier. Sideclick&rsquo;s clip-on design attaches in a snap and allows you to utilize your streaming remote&rsquo;s voice search feature which is lost in other universal remote options.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>$108,000 raised
with 2,651 backers.</p>

<p>Ditch the Other Remotes
Sideclick snaps onto your existing streaming remote, allowing you to control the basic functions of your TV and your streaming device all-in-one. As cordcutters, we developed Sideclick because we needed a simple solution to juggling multiple remotes when streaming.</p>

<p>Simple to Program and Use
Sideclick attaches in a snap and makes accessing streaming apps quicker and easier, especially for kids. Sideclick uses IR learning technology to program 8 buttons of your choice over multiple devices in just minutes. No fumbling with source codes or having to connect the remote to your computer. Just point and program.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t Lose Your Voice Search
Sideclick&rsquo;s patent-pending clip-on design allows you to utilize your streaming remote&rsquo;s voice search feature which is lost in other universal remote options</p>

<p>Interchangeable Device
If you decide to upgrade or change your streaming device, you can still use your Sideclick. You just need a new adapter clip for the new streaming remote. No reprogramming necessary.</p>

<p>Affordable Solution
Get a Sideclick for every TV in your house for less than you&rsquo;d pay for 1 RF/Bluetooth compatible, over-complicated smart universal remote.</p>

<p>Streamline Your Streaming Experience
Sideclick Remotes provides products that Streamline Your Streaming Experience. As cordcutters, we only need to control the TV&rsquo;s power and volume, change channels using an HD antenna, change Input and perform only a few other basic functions while streaming. Sideclick offers a simple and affordable all-in-one solution to juggling multiple remotes or using expensive and over-complicated universal remotes.</p>

<p>About the Startup</p>

<p>Describe your product in 3 words.</p>

<p>Simple Streaming Solution</p>

<p>How did you come up with the idea for this product?</p>

<p>Having grown frustrated at the price of our monthly cable bill our family became cordcutters. We started researching streaming devices and decided on a Roku device. We loved the simplicity of the remote but hated how we were always searching for a different remote to power ON/OFF the TV and a third remote to control the volume on our Sound Bar. Brett, a mechanical engineer and product designer, sketched the idea for Sideclick and used a 3D printer to create the first prototype. Given the positive feedback we received from family and friends and the overall trend in streaming device sales, we decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to gauge interest. We loved the collaborative atmosphere that crowdfunding provided and with the help of over 2,600 Backers, Sideclick became a reality.</p>

<p>What makes your product special?</p>

<p>Sideclick Remotes provides products that Streamline Your Streaming Experience. As cordcutters, we only need to be able to control the TV&rsquo;s volume, change channels using an HD antenna, change Input and perform only a few other basic functions while streaming. Sideclick offers a simple and affordable all-in-one solution to juggling multiple remotes or using expensive and over-complicated universal remotes.</p>

<p>What has been the best part of your startup experience?</p>

<p>The best part of our startup experience is the collaborative atmosphere and general support we received from our backers. Their patience with design delays and all of the positive feedback we received once the product was delivered made all of the challenges of product development worthwhile. Another best part of our startup experience is the feeling that we are living the American dream. We have created something together as a family that solves a basic problem. Despite the many many challenges we have faced, we continue to proceed as if success is inevitable. Our family, friends, and backers have allowed us to retain the optimism required in creating a new business.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-design-really-cool-concept-love-it">Great design, really cool concept, love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write reviews often but I&rsquo;m thrilled about this little gizmo. I&rsquo;m a tech junkie and since I saw this concept I&rsquo;ve been dying to try it. The remote is more durable than I thought, its seamless with the remote as seen in the image; the only thing to get used to is the extra width since it adds about 3/4ths of the remotes original thickness.The programming was fairly easy, it took about 1 minute after I realized which buttons I wanted; very cool and simple. Definitely great not to have to look for the other remote to control volume and power, the convinience is just great.The price is ehhh.. look considering the design and function, it&rsquo;s worth it. This isn&rsquo;t a cheaply designed poor material built design; it looks like it took time to get a precise and seamless fit, the housing holds 2AA batteries which are included, that was great to see; ready to use right out the box.There you have it, my first review in 2017 and just because this product IS something that makes a daily difference, I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea">Great Idea!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second device with the first one being almost a year old now, it is a must have for non smart TV cord cutters who use a HDTV antenna and Fire device but could be better if it had a few more extra buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-all-remotes-are-the-same-this-one-does-so-much-more">Not All Remotes are the Same&hellip;THIS ONE DOES SO MUCH MORE&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Addition to the Fire TV or Fire Stick Remote. I went from three remotes to one with this simple product. It is a piece-of-cake to program (I mean it was really simple), easy to attach to the Amazon Remote, and it feels and operates like a quality product. It feels good in my hands and is easy to use without even having to look at the buttons. I am going to buy another one for my other TV.I noticed some of the competing products have very limited programming capability&hellip;the Sideclick can accept programming from a variety of audio equipment&hellip;much, much better than the competition. I programmed a Samsung TV, an Onkyo Receiver, and another Customized Remote.THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="consolidate-your-remote-controls-with-this-easy-to-setup-gadget">Consolidate your remote controls with this easy-to-setup gadget!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Incredibly easy to program - as easy as pointing the remotes at each other and clicking the corresponding buttons. Each remote I purchased took less than 1 minute to set up. I bought my first one for the living room Fire TV and as soon as I received it, set it up and started using it, immediately ordered one for the bedroom. Having recently cut the cord on cable, this helped keep everything I need in one controller. There are 2 buttons labeled A and B that can be used for other remote features you may want to setup on this that don&rsquo;t align to the other buttons that have the typical +/-/power symbols. I use one for mute. Simply point and program. The kit comes with clips for both the voice-enabled and non voice-enabled remotes so you&rsquo;re covered if you have one or the other. The 2-AAA batteries were also included.If you&rsquo;re looking to consolidate your remotes, I highly recommend grabbing one of these. I can now power on/off, volume up/down, channel up/down and change inputs on my Vizio and Sony TVs with one small remote.</p>

<h5 id="5-stars-perfect-fit-easy-programming-how-is-this-not-standard-equipment">5 stars, perfect fit, easy programming, how is this not standard equipment?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a FireTV stick or box or a roku these side clicks are great. 8 programmable buttons (programmed all 8 in 90 secs with ease) No more tracking down 3 remotes (TV, sound bar, fire stick). Comes with a bracket customized for your remote type (no universal BS) straight from amazon. (Roku bracket is ordered separately I believe)If anyone has suffered from the terror of toddlers making off with 1 of your remotes leaving you without sound this is the way to fly.Thank you for this product! It was clearly well thought out. Being in IT people often ask me for personal technology recommendations, but I usually try to avoid it lest I be stuck supporting it.You are the first product in 5 years I actually made a legitimate post on Facebook talking about how greatly this item performs its intended purpose. Flawless execution!Comes with side click, battery, brackets for fire tv and fire stick remotes (voice/non voice) and some clever packaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-needed-for-cable-cutters">Must needed for cable cutters!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our family has cut the cable cords and moved to streaming cable/netflix! We purchased a couple Amazon Fire Sticks to stream all these services. We have smart tv&rsquo;s but found they don&rsquo;t always have all the apps available - example Playstation Vue or Sling. (both services that we&rsquo;ve been trying out) So the addition of the Fire Sticks was great, but it was a pain to have so many different remotes. The Sideclick has an AWESOME! We can move from the Fire TV to a digital antenna to get our local channels, turn the volume up and turn everything off with 1 remote. Don&rsquo;t need to have 3 remotes on hand anymore!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It WORKS!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not easily impressed, but this item was rather impressive. I got it and in 15 mins, I got the thing programmed and tested. I had previously attempted to &ldquo;combine&rdquo; remotes with a harmony, but I ended up with two remotes, the manufacturer&rsquo;s and the Harmony (the manufacturer&rsquo;s remote didn&rsquo;t have a sleep button and it is 3 levels deep in the menu!). So having had history with Harmony, I was surprised that it was so easy to program. I programmed my A button to be mute and B to be sleep. Now, my tv entertainment system is complete.Will update if the situation changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yes-you-need-this">Yes, You Need This</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This doohickey is amazing - if you&rsquo;re on the fence, DO IT! The only &ldquo;warning&rdquo; I would offer is that it needs a remote to learn from. I bought it because my packers lost my remote in my recent move. So I ended up buying a $5 remote from Walmart and then programming the sideclick from that. It&rsquo;s awesome, it&rsquo;s perfect. I use Fire sticks exclusively, so there are three more TVs in the house and I plan to get sideclicks for. I wasn&rsquo;t able to program the &ldquo;mute&rdquo; button, but I think that was operator error - hopefully by the time I&rsquo;ve programmed three more, I&rsquo;ll get that option figured out! :))</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-easily-with-the-amazon-fire-report">Fits easily with the Amazon Fire report</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits easily with the Amazon Fire report. Does take a bit to get used to the feel in your hand but super easy to program and works well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-future-is-here">The future is here&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased 2 and have had no issues. This has to be a saviour for all those using multiple remotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-firetv-owners">A must have for FireTV owners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own 4 of these and absolutely love them, ended up putting one in every room. I have an internet cable subscription on my FireTVs (PS Vue) and am always using my FireTV remotes&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little accessory for your Amazon remote. I was tired of always getting my TV controller out to change the volume or input or turn the TV on or off but this little addition&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-works-great-forget-whole-foods">This thing works great! Forget Whole Foods</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing works great! Forget Whole Foods, you need to buy Sideclick and incorporate it into one, easily held Fire TV remote.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea-just-what-i-needed">Great Idea! Just what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FANTASTIC! Works great and I can put all the other remotes in the drawer. powers TV and Bose surround. So far so good. Ordering another one for my bedroom</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-overall-happy-with-the-sideclick-remote">I am overall happy with the sideclick remote</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am overall happy with the sideclick remote. I had no problem sinking it to our TV and it is easy to opperating. After you get used to the awkward shape, you are in business.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-easy-to-program">Perfect, Easy to Program</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a perfect purchase. We bought the Sideclick to perform a few simple functions while we were watching Netflix: to change the input, the volume, pause, mute, and turn off&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yes">Yes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very convenient. Easy to program. Get this!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It won&rsquo;t work on the newer models of smart tv&rsquo;s since most of them use a combination of RF and Bluetooth signals. This remote only uses RF signals.</p>
