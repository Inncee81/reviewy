<h5 id="outputs-go-black-even-if-you-manually-set-the-switch">Outputs go black even if you manually set the switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found that when leaving the switch settings (4 up as it is shipped as), the display on the outputs would go black for a few seconds, every couple of minutes. Very annoying if you are actually viewing the outputs. Decided to manually change the switch settings to the source. That worked better but the outputs would still go black for a few seconds about every 20 or so minutes - apparently I was wrong to assume that the &ldquo;auto-sense&rdquo; of the device would turn itself off if you changed the switch settings to something other than the default settings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="splits-the-output-signal-and-looks-great-across-all-displays">Splits the output signal and looks great across all displays</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A fantastic little device that has no problem splitting a connection to 4 outputs. It has a ton of different video options that can be set by dip switches on the rear of the device with the use of the included instructions. The Orei 1x4 2.0 Splitter WILL NOT strip the HDCP protection, so if you are going to split it to a capture device you will get a &ldquo;No Signal&rdquo;. It did work fine with find with the HDCP stripper I plugged in. I had a PS4&gt;HDCP Stripper&gt;Orei 1x4 Splitter and all devices worked perfectly including my capture card.</p>

<h5 id="i-found-it-annoying-enough-to-put-two-http">I found it annoying enough to put two http</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I noticed about this unit. It is slow to detect and decode, then present the signal. So just changing channels on the tv results in several seconds of the split off device receiving the correct signal and displaying it (about 5 seconds give or take as the device times out and says no signal until the OREI decodes and presents the signal.. I found it annoying enough to put two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002673EW6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002673EW6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a> in place of the 4 port as they decode and present the signal much faster. I am still using it on some devices to split the signal, but the main devices I use to display the signal are on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002673EW6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002673EW6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a> for a faster response.</p>

<h5 id="this-product-did-not-work-with-my-sony-soundbar">This product did not work with my Sony soundbar. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product did not work with my Sony soundbar. My sound bar has one HDMI out, which I wanted to split to go to my TV and my projector so I didn&rsquo;t have to switch the cables when I wanted to switch what I was watching. Connecting this simply caused my soundbar not to work at all, I got no sound and no image on either screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-for-3-months">Works great for 3 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for 3 months. Then my TV&rsquo;s started to have &ldquo;audio distortion&rdquo;. The &ldquo;distorted audio&rdquo; progressively became more pronounced and more frequent. Then I bought new HDMI cables to replace the old ones thinking it was the cables. After quite a bit of trouble shooting, I discovered the audio distortion originated from this Splitter. If I reboot the Splitter the audio will be OK for a while, then it returned. I bought another HDMI splitter from a different brand a month ago. The audio distortion is now gone. But then it is too late for a return and replace. $$ evaporated. I would not touch this brand ever again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hdmi-splitter-1-to-4">HDMI splitter 1 to 4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My cable box does not like splitters. this one works perfectly for me but may not be perfect for all. In my case, I have a rarely used home theatre except for Sunday football with my friends. I also have a Sling Box which required its feed from my cable box so I can watch my football team when I am away over the net remotely. And of course my main 65&rdquo; panasonic in the family room is always in use. I never need more than one of those devices on except on very rare occasion when I want the game on in the theatre and in the family room. When that happens, the TV image is fine on the TV but the audio is cut out - however, the theatre works perfectly, sound and picture. So, all the devices works perfectly when only one of those three require viewing but when multiple devices require viewing simultaneously, it may not work too elegantly (no switching required). I did not try switching ports because i don&rsquo;t need to but I&rsquo;m sure if you switch ports, the priority can be changed so your primary always gets picture and sound no matter what&rsquo;s on and that may work for you.</p>

<h5 id="it-works-great-we-just-split-the-signal-to-the-tv">It works great, we just split the signal to the TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these for our work. We wanted to put a TV on the wall that had the exact same thing our computer screen showed so our patients could see what we saw while talked with them. It works great, we just split the signal to the TV, and there is no loss of quality, we&rsquo;ve had no issues with it cutting out or not working, and it&rsquo;s been running 9 - 5 m-f for over a year now. I know we aren&rsquo;t using it for what most people use it for, but it&rsquo;s working great for us. The 2 monitors are only 10 feet apart at the most, so if you have to longer, your results may vary, but we really loved this unit, it was a great purchase, definitely recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="splits-hdmi-but-runs-hot-and-no-hdmi-cec">Splits HDMI, but Runs hot and no HDMI-CEC</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a piece of electronics equipment that consistently feels as hot to the touch as this device. I even attached rubber stoppers to the bottom of it to help dissipate the heat away from the wooden entertainment center shelf. Although the basic functionality of splitting the HDMI signal works well, I wasn&rsquo;t able to use it as I hoped due to the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t pass on HDMI-CEC signals (which can wake up the TV or toggle it over to another HDMI port). The HDMI-CEC signals are sent when any of my devices are connected directly or even through an HDMI toggle box, but unfortunately this splitter doesn&rsquo;t pass on those signals. It&rsquo;s too bad that a device with such high ratings has these shortcomings with heat management and managing (what seems to be) a fairly standard control signal.</p>
