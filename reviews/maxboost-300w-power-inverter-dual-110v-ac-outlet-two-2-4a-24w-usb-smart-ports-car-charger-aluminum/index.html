<blockquote>
<p>This will be a technical review of the product features that will access the quality of design and manufacturing.Firstly I must say the design of this is really nice! Some little features like the AC socket snapping into place with the USB port is just great idea and must make assembly a breeze!Manufacturing:Reflow Quality 9.5/10Wire Harness Quality <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (all adequately heat shrinked)Through Hole Solder Quality 9/10Flux removal <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (Bottom side could use some cleaning after through hole soldering but this is not a big deal, and will not effect reliability)Bodge Wires <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (there is one small fix that I imagine will get fixed in the future but it was done in a method that will prove reliable.)Design:Packaging <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (good retail looking box)Electronics Packaging <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (not sure why there are 3 not used holes on the outside I imagine it the enclosure might be shared between another product.)High voltage isolation <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (I would have liked to have seen some isolation slots, but the gap they have of 2-3mm is acceptable.Component Choice 7.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (would like to see better capacitor brands and user replaceable input fuse)Convince 9.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (The small size is great, along with the 4mm banana jack inputs make it really easy to hard wire it into your solar system or car. The big color LED indicator tells you when the output is good. The only thing I wish it had was a way to mount it easily to something)Heatsinking 9.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (I really like the silicone sleeves over the mosfets that are then clamped to the outside aluminum extrusion, this couples with the fan keeps the product nice and cool under full load. I also like how the fan is only on when the temperature rises)USB output <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>(nice stable output. I am not sure why ports are said to be limited to 2.4amps I can draw 3.5amps the max my test equipment allows me at the moment)Overall I really like this product. I am not sure what I will use it for yet but I can be confident that it will work when I need it!-DISCLAIMER&ndash; I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product, based upon my own personal experience.- I have not been coached or asked to provide positive feedback, nor have I received any compensation or incentive from the company for this review.- I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR part 255 &ldquo;guidelines concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising&rdquo;.- I am not affiliated with this company or any of their products, in any way.- The views expressed here are my own, based on my personal use and experience with the product, and are unbiased and honest reviews.

<h5 id="this-is-my-first-power-inverter-with-dual-ac-outlet-and-usb-ports">This is my first power inverter with dual AC outlet and USB ports.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the newer vehicles that you can purchase right now come with one or two ac outlets built in. However it was not standard built back 2011. There is no ac outlets in my Toyota Rav4. I have been in the market for one of these power inverter with outlets and usb for a while. I am very impressed with this power inverter dual ac outlet and usb ports from Maxboost.Arrived in well packaging in a small priority shipping box. This is a One Piece unit. There is no other accessories in the package but an user manual. The plug was detachable, you can remove the power cable that makes storage easier than ever. I like the compact size and Aluminum feel of this unit. The cord is about the right length for me. It&rsquo;ll reach the passenger seat just fine.I want to be clear that this is a nicely working unit that will be fine in your running car. My initial goal was to find an inverter that has both ac outlets and usb charging ports since I want to charge my phone and laptop at the same time. Another reason I bought this unit was because the review that written by Kyle Smith. You can find his review of this power inverter in the review section of the product. He wrote a technical review of this product about the design and build quality.<strong>Pros</strong>- 2 AC outlets + 2 usb ports. 2 USB ports each one is capable of 2.4A. It also features with built-in mSMART chip that can identify the attached devices to provide the maximum output up to 2.4A.- High quality. You can tell by just holding it on hand- Travel size design.- Durable metal housing provides advanced protection from drops and bumps.- One-Year Limitied Warranty includedLet&rsquo;s talk about the ac outlets. SAFETY FIRST. I recommend use it for charging laptop, tablet, DVD players, camera, lights or other electronic devices. Do not use high power electric devices such as hair dryers, electric heater, curling irons. Again, Safety first. I would avoid placing the inverter into sunlight directly or next to hear sensitive materials to protect inverter from getting too warm. Also try not to leave the power inverter in the ON position while your car is off. This is just something that I will do to keep my vehicle, my family and myself safe.</p>

<h5 id="didn-t-work-with-65w-laptop-charger">Didn&rsquo;t work with 65W laptop charger.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: I received a certified letter that notified if I remove this negative review, they will bribe me with a $30 gift card.Bought this to charge laptop (charger/Transformer rated at 65W) and it faults out whenever charger is plugged in.Does not work for its intended purpose. 300W rating seems to be more than optimistic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk-not-worth-the-money">Junk, not worth the money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this about 2.5 months ago, and the fan has now died, causing this to be a trickle charger. This is quite disappointing considering the fact that I had a cyberpower inverter last for about 9 years with the same use. I will be opening the inverter up when I get home to see what went wrong with the thing.Before I do that, a few tips: Do not have this plugged in when you start your vehicle, it will blow fuses. Do not plug in a phone and a 90w charger for your laptop, it will break it. Do not move the inverter, that will make it stop charging for some reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A little clunky but fantastic for vacations or long road trips. This thing saved me and allowed me to work all the way through a 9 hour car drive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of-money">Waste of money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It broke after 7 hours of light use. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on this product. There are plenty of other choices. Zero star rating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-device">Good device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As expected and great value and if any one needs something like this then this would be a good purchase</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for a trip to Florida that we took this year. The kids all needed a place to plug in their chargers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work-with-anything-but-low-power-ac-devices">Doesn&rsquo;t work with anything but low power AC devices.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All the good reviews, I guess I am unlucky. The fan never turns on. The unit does allow me to use the AC rapid phone charger in the AC outlet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price">Great price.</h5>

<p>Very good unit for an extremely affordable price.</p>
