<p>Product Description
Inventor&rsquo;s Note:
As a mother of two teenagers who are constantly on the move between basketball and football practice there are always uniforms that need last minute washing. It was a waste of water, electricity, and money to run a full size washer for small loads. With my experience in the laundry industry it was obvious there was a better way to wash those in-between loads. The Laundry POD, inspired by salads spinners, uses less than 3 gallons of water and zero electricity. The Laundry POD takes up very little space and is perfect for dorms. I was so pleased that I was able to bring my idea to fruition. Now I never waste any water on unnecessary loads of laundry. When my kids go to college at least I know they will have clean clothes. I hope that this invention makes a difference to people all over the world.</p>

<p>The Laundry POD
The Laundry POD is a portable washer designed for washing small loads of laundry using a minimal amount of water and ZERO electricity. Winner of the Best Greener Gadget award and Top Global Innovation GIA award! The Laundry POD features a manually operated spinning system for washing your garments and then extracting the water for the shortest drying time. It is more convenient than hand washing, and great for washing delicates. Compact enough to be portable, but serious enough to stand up to tough laundry challenges. The Laundry POD is perfect for dorms, apartments, camping or anyone looking to add a little green to their laundry routine. Save money, time and effort while helping the impact. It fits under your sink and into your life indoors and outdoors. The Laundry POD puts a whole new spin on clean.</p>

<p>Laundry POD X-ray View larger
An Engineered Product Easy to Use
Since the washboard very few advances have been in non-electronic washing. Now there is The Laundry POD, a non-electric portable washer. The Laundry POD replicates the regular washing cycle of a conventional washer, but gentler. The Laundry POD is designed specifically for small loads and delicates. The rotation of the internal basket helps to cause agitation with the clothes to get them clean. The Laundry POD uses centrifugal force to extract most of the water during the drying cycle. The Laundry POD is made just for you. Put a new spin on laundry with The Laundry POD.</p>

<p>Compact and Portable
The Laundry POD is a portable and simple way to do laundry on the go. The Laundry POD does not require electricity or any kind of motor. In addition The Laundry POD requires very little water. It is perfect for the world traveler or the constant camper.</p>

<p>Faster Than Hand Washing
Hand washing one item of clothing can be a lot of work. The Laundry POD is an easier way to get your clothes clean. The Laundry POD is better for delicates than hand washing. After completing the drying cycle your clothes don&rsquo;t need any wringing out because most of the water has been removed from the clothes. A few simple rotations of the handle and your clothes are clean. The Laundry POD uses a system making washing faster and more effective, yet gentle enough for delicates.</p>

<p>Save Time and Money
Conventional washers are not only a drain on your wallet, but also on your time. A conventional washer costs hundreds of dollars a year to run. Each load uses about 40 gallons of water. The cost to do laundry at a Laundromat can be even more expensive. Save money and time with The Laundry POD, the washer.</p>

<p>Washing System
Conventional washers use a lot of electricity and up to 40 gallons of water with each load. The Laundry POD uses less than 3 gallons of the water and zero electricity. Using less water and no electricity can help to minimize your lasting impact on the Earth. Not only good for your wallet, but good for the planet too.</p>

<p>Product Features
The Laundry POD is an washing system, using a fraction of the water consumed by a standard washing machine and zero electricity
It&rsquo;s compact and portable making it perfect for apartments, camping, college, boating, RVing, and anywhere space is tight
Gentle wash and extract cycles are ideal for &ldquo;hand-washing&rdquo; delicates
Easy to use spinning, washing and draining system can clean clothes in less than 10 minutes
With no electricity or quarters needed, The Laundry POD saves you money as well as time
How does it work?
The Laundry POD is a portable alternative to conventional washers. First you fill The POD with 4-6 liters of water and just a tablespoon of your favorite detergent. We suggest that an detergent. Next you place up to 10 garments in the basket. Now you let the garments soak for a couple of minutes. Once you&rsquo;ve placed your clothes into The Laundry POD it&rsquo;s a simple process. Now that all the washing materials are in The POD you just make a few simple rotations of the handle. Just a minute is all it takes to get your clothes clean. The rotation causes agitation and enables the clothes to be scrubbed and cleaned. Drain the water by opening the valve and rotating the handle to extract the dirty water. It&rsquo;s time for the rinse cycle, just put some clean water in The POD and rotate the handle. Now the clothes are done being cleaned and are ready to be dried. All you have to do is open the valve on the bottom and place the draining tube into the sink. Now rotate the handle again and this will extract most of the water. The spinning will remove the water from the clothing using centrifugal force. The Laundry POD is equipped with easy spinning gears, so doing laundry is simple. The rest of the water will be removed when the clothes are hung up to dry completely.</p>

<h5 id="great-convenience-for-a-single-mom">Great convenience for a single mom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read the reviews carefully before buying this since I didn&rsquo;t want to waste money on a tight budget and there&rsquo;s a large variation in the reviews. I didn&rsquo;t need to worry - this is a great item and does just what it says it will. I do think people&rsquo;s expectations are a problem with this: look, you&rsquo;re hand washing. You have to expect that you&rsquo;re providing the power. That said, you&rsquo;re getting a <em>much</em> more efficient wash and rinse with much less effort than you would in the sink or a bucket, and you&rsquo;re getting a spin dry to avoid some and often all hand-wringing. That&rsquo;s huge! It&rsquo;s a good design, well made, and definitely improves the efficiency of hand washing. The only question is whether such a product fits your lifestyle.As a single mom, I <em>dread</em> the weekly trips to the laundry room in my apartment complex with (at least) two huge bags of laundry and a three year old in tow. Three trips back and forth, two of them carrying heavy loads, and not able to do anything else for at least 2.5 hours because I&rsquo;m waiting for that timer to ring and don&rsquo;t want to hog the community washers and dryers. It is <em>so</em> much better to put this in my bathtub (at the end away from the drain, the natural slope of the tub allows the hose to drain just fine) and work on getting the wash done as just another part of the household chores, nothing heavy to carry, not dragging my three year old out, no weather to contend with, etc. I bought a little rack to hang things dry, and a steamer to make it as easy as possible to get out any remaining wrinkles, and I&rsquo;m good to go.Not only is the work of getting the laundry done more pleasant this way, there&rsquo;s the added bonus of being able to do any needed items mid-week, a big deal for gym stuff or when my son wears holes in the knees of all but one pair of jeans in a single week! That&rsquo;s just not possible with the laundry room, or practical for only a few items.I&rsquo;ll need to go to the laundry room for the big stuff from time to time - but I may actually be able to do those items more often now, and I certainly won&rsquo;t have to go every week. This is a huge win.As far as capacity, I&rsquo;ve been sorting things into regular plastic grocery bags, that&rsquo;s about the right size for a single load. If you overload, of course it won&rsquo;t work as well. That&rsquo;s physics, not faulty design. I&rsquo;m plus sized, and right now I&rsquo;ve got my gym pants and shirt in there along with one of my work shirts - and that&rsquo;s a pretty small load. I could easily have added another shirt, or a few things of my son&rsquo;s, but I opted to leave the extra space to get a better cleaning for the gym stuff. It will do two pairs of my works pants no problem. I could probably do two full days of my son&rsquo;s clothes at a time and he&rsquo;s in a 5T. It&rsquo;s not huge, but it&rsquo;s not ridiculously tiny. It fits more than it looks like it will.Overall I&rsquo;m extremely happy with this purchase. It makes my life easier and does a good job on the clothes. A+!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="does-exactly-what-it-says-it-will">Does exactly what it says it will</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really liking this product! I use it mostly for workout clothes, because I don&rsquo;t have enough of those to keep a good supply in between loads of regular laundry. It&rsquo;s perfect for that: It gets them clean, spins out enough water that they dry overnight (usually; it gets pretty humid here in the winter, and nothing ever dries then), and does it all reasonably quickly and easily. It&rsquo;s also great for those little emergencies: Oops, I forgot to wash the top I wanted to wear tomorrow. Oops, I&rsquo;m out of clean underwear. Etc.It&rsquo;s taken a bit of practice to figure out how to fill and drain this thing without spraying water all over everything (pro tip: Make sure the drain is closed before filling!), and how to agitate the clothes so they actually move relative to each other (turn the handle slowly, and change direction often) but I feel like I&rsquo;m past the learning curve now, and it&rsquo;s doing just what I need it to.I feel like a lot of the negative reviews on here are due to people wanting this product to be a different product, so let&rsquo;s talk about what this device is NOT:&ndash;It is not electric powered. It does take some work, involving you and your muscles, to operate. However, if you are capable of basic activities of daily living, I don&rsquo;t see any reason why you couldn&rsquo;t use this machine.&ndash;It is not a full-sized washer. It just isn&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t put a whole load of laundry in here. And when it says &ldquo;up to 10&rdquo; items, I think maybe that means 10 individual socks. For anything else, you can probably fit 3 or 4 lightweight items like t-shirts, or 1 or 2 bigger ones.&ndash;Similarly, it is not a replacement for a real washing machine, unless you have nothing else to do, ever, except laundry. It is, however, a way to cut back on the number of loads you need to do in the real washer, because you can take care of little things as they come up instead of running &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; loads that aren&rsquo;t full enough.&ndash;It is not a spin dryer. However, it does get clothes dryer than I can get them by wringing them out after washing in the sink. It just takes a little time and patience: Keep spinning until water stops coming out of the hose! Then maybe give it a few more spins for good measure. Yeah, it&rsquo;s work, but you can spend 3 extra minutes spinning now, or an extra day waiting for your clothes to dry and cleaning up drips from the floor. I&rsquo;ll take the 3 minutes.So. If you keep those limitations in mind and use the POD appropriately, I think you&rsquo;ll like it as much as I do.READ MORE</p>

<p>I purchased this laundry pod because I live alone and where I live we cannot have a regular washer. It works great on hand washables. It washes and rinses great on shirts and jeans. The problem that I do have is not with the product but with me. I am in my 60&rsquo;s and I don&rsquo;t have the strength to spin the clothes fast enough to get all the water out. I would recommend this for anyone living in an RV or tiny home.READ MORE</p>
