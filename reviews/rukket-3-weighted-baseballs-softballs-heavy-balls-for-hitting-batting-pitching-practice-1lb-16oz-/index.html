<p>Rukket PurePower Weighted Hitting and Pitching Training Balls</p>

<p>INSPECT WHAT YOU EXPECT</p>

<p>These heavy weighted training baseballs are specifically designed to help develop the muscle memory needed for a perfect and powerful swing - and allow you to quickly fix mistakes you may be making at the plate. Our weighted training ball allows you to truly &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the bat as you drive the barrel thru the ball. Each ball is designed so that if it&rsquo;s not hit pure - even if it&rsquo;s hit just a little off-center - it&rsquo;ll just wobble and fall harmlessly to the ground. Because of this unique design, you&rsquo;ll know with every swing whether your swing is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.</p>

<p>EXPECT THE BEST</p>

<p>Our weighted balls are ridiculously rugged, made from the most durable material, weigh 1lb (16oz.) each and are 3&rdquo; in diameter. Other companies won&rsquo;t stand their products, we will because we know the specs that they are manufactured to, so you can buy with confidence knowing this is the best-weighted training ball you can buy.</p>

<p>WHO NEEDS SAFETY NETS ???</p>

<p>Well, we sell those too (our 12X9 Barrier Net is particularly good) so we&rsquo;ll go ahead and say that you need one of those as well. In all seriousness though, these balls are heavy - at least for a baseball - and they just won&rsquo;t travel nearly as far. Small space, best new training aid, no net needed, team stays safe, it&rsquo;s a win-win.</p>

<p>DON&rsquo;T WORRY BE HAPPY</p>

<p>&hellip; because at RUKKET we stand behind every item we sell. There&rsquo;s a reason we&rsquo;ve gone from a small, little Delaware start-up to one of the fastest-growing sports training aids companies in the USA and it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re fanatical about only manufacturing and selling the best products for our customers. If for any reason, we&rsquo;ve let you down and you&rsquo;re not happy for any reason, just let us know we will gladly take it back for a full refund.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy customer!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought to practice with our 7 year old. Perfect weight and even better not having to chase balls all over the yard. We looked online &amp; at several local sporting goods stores and the Rukket was the best price by far. Will purchase Rukket again when the time comes to replace or upgrade. A proud Rukket ball bag toter as well as Rukket bragger. Thanks for being a company that puts so much into making sure the customer is happy and the product is durable.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="finally-a-great-option">Finally a great option!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great indoor/outdoor heavyball throwing/training balls! Unlike other true heavy balls made for overweight throwing, that are dark in color and hard impact, these balls are softer and bright red, rendering they as a safe option for throwing programs. Often, when using other heavy balls, it was literally like taking a chance with my health. They have metal construction with a plastic covering and are usually black in the 12 oz. weight. Not the Rukket balls! These will prove especially valuable over the winter when throwing indoors and with less than adequate lighting.I wish these were available 5 years ago!!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="just-what-we-needed">Just what we needed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these for my 9 y/o Little league team. They seem very well built and are better priced than our local sporting goods chains. I also like the sturdy box they come in for storage. To build up strength and form, these ball do just that. Great for a smaller yard too as they don&rsquo;t go far once the batter hits it.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-price-good-quality-weighted-baseballs">Great price - good quality weighted baseballs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had found a weighted baseball after a game once and it was perfect for my 10 year old. We eventually found the owner and returned the ball and have been looking for some since then. These balls come in at about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the price of any other weighted ball and seem to be an exact replica save the color. We used them for batting warm ups before games. Also, we played catch a couple of times and I was surprised to find my arm a bit sore after throwing and catching this ball for a few minutes.As I&rsquo;ve only used them a handful of times I can&rsquo;t comment on the longevity (yet) but initial quality (JD Power - thanks Mahk) seems fantastic.I would buy these again.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="investing-in-your-kids-sport">Investing in your kids sport.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My two boys aged 9 &amp; 13 decided to try baseball this year and have done well even though there has not been a lot of practice time due to weather and games. I noticed their coach using what i called dead balls in the gym one practice and asked about them as I do not have much flat land to practice their hitting. He said to check out Rukket so I purchased these. I should have gotten the 9 pack instead of the three but funds are tight ( baseball is not a cheap sport to get into!). i finally got to use them this past week and I am very pleased with them. I also showed them to the coach as he has older ones and he was impressed with them and the price. My boys like them and we used them for BP before last nights game for my oldest. The kids did good and one other parent/coach had never used them and will likely be getting him some. Know only if I could find some practice balls for a reasonable price along with a tee and hitting net I can have my boys practice at the house.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-for-training">Great for training&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our travel team head coach had a set of these balls and the kids love them (trying to keep a straight face here). I decided to buy some so we can play with these balls in the backyard. Great for frontal soft toss and not having to worry about a net; helps my son keep his back in the strikezone for a longer period of time.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-training-in-backyard">Perfect for training in backyard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these for my 8 year old so we could practice baseball in the backyard without fear of breaking any windows or anything else. These are perfect for hitting with his game bat. I toss them and he whacks away. I don&rsquo;t have to chase balls all over the place, either since even the most direct hit only sends the ball about 10 feet. It also saves a lot of time and cost by not having to go to the batting cages all the time. For tossing, I am sure these will help build his arm strength, too!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-weighted-balls-are-great-tools-for-teaching-the-players-proper-mechanics">The weighted balls are great tools for teaching the players proper mechanics</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The weighted balls are great tools for teaching the players proper mechanics, while emphasizing the need to swing with a lot of force. These are great for making sure the hitter uses both the lower and upper part of the body during the swing. Hitters become more aware of when they connect with the ball well. These definitely provide the &ldquo;ah ha&rdquo; moment where a focus on proper mechanics yields immediate results. The product seems very durable, and is appropriate for the age levels I coach and beyond.READ MORE</p>

<p>These have worked great so far. I am really hopeful that they will strengthen my boys swing and help him swing through the ball.</p>
