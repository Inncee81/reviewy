<h5 id="both-4mm-and-6mm-version-are-extremely-good">Both 4mm and 6mm version are extremely good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 2nd TriVision NC-335PW Camera, and this model is 6mm focus length version, the last cam I buy is 4mm. The difference is the distance and angle.4mm: wilder angle, shorter distance6mm: narrower angle, longer distancesee the picture to show the differenceBoth are good camera.I had been searching around for a long long time to get an outdoor camera that met my criteria in reasonable price. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s rated for this camera:1. Well build and tough=&gt; 5* body build with metal, and inside looks clean and firm2. support SD card for offline recording when my wifi is down=&gt; 4.5* support my 32gb MicroSD card, but not standard SD card, which is less optimal, as SD card is cheaper and faster.3. have different power options=&gt; 5* It supports POE, AC/DC power adapter (provided)4. have different network setup options=&gt; 4.5* It supports wifi b/g/n, DHCP, manual setup. but not 802.11ac, but acceptable.5. support writing files to NAS directly=&gt; 4* working well, but only 1 sub-folder, and very slow for doing any file deletions/browsing operations. I will just use my PC to browse the NAS share instead of the camera interface.6. support writing files to FTP remotely=&gt; 3* Only works when you inserted a SD card, and the upload is delayed for more than 15min from my testing.7. support android app &ldquo;IP Cam Viewer v5.8.3 or up&rdquo;=&gt; 5* working great, this is important to me, because I have many different brands of cameras, and I need to view them all at once.8. Good night vision, must have IR cut filter=&gt; 5* very good image quality and distance9. Motion detection and alarm=&gt; 4.5* not too sensitive, but i don&rsquo;t think there is a better solution in markets.10. scheduling of alarm=&gt; 5* work as expected11. define the window size and sensitivities of motion detection=&gt; 5* it&rsquo;s important to me, as I don&rsquo;t want the movement of my tree trigger the alert all the time. and it can define multiple windows12. password protected for all access=&gt; 4* good, but no https13. no unknown outgoing connections for whatever reasons=&gt; this is very important, most china made cam had unknown outgoing connections which I am very concern, but this cam does not have the problem.So, overall, I give it 5* for the excellent camera. even full price, I will purchase it again when I need one.This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.14. Long range and stable wifi connection=&gt; 5* I tried most other wifi camera, most of them are having issue when connecting to a far away wifi router, and usually need a repeater, that&rsquo;s why some dlink models provide repeater functions. But, this camera provides excellent long distance wifi connection, good speed, and keep the connection stable.15. reconnect after router reboot=&gt; 5* again, most other camera need a restart after I reboot my router. I was originally think this one is the same. but not. It reconnects in 1-2 min. this is a excellent feature.16. configuration when you have two cameras=&gt; 3.5* if you own two of these camera, you should turn off UPNP, and map in your route by yourself, otherwise they will conflict each other, and make them very slow.Overall, once everything setup, it&rsquo;s excellent!</p>

<h5 id="i-m-tough-should-probably-deserves-5-stars">I&rsquo;m tough, should probably deserves 5 stars.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fantastic product! Is definitely high tech. I&rsquo;m giving it four instead of five stores simply because the company touts a three-step, easy, process to set up. I don&rsquo;t believe that is completely genuine. HOWEVER, as mentioned, the product is fantastic and produces very good quality video. However, because the equipment is so complex, there are so many different settings that it&rsquo;s very difficult to work through as a newbie. Again, however, tech-support is very responsive via email and provides very clear step-by-step instructions. They have been fantastic!While you can control much of the camera via the app, there are still many settings that require you to be at a computer that has the software downloaded. The software on a laptop or desktop is the only way to control the many, many different settings. I would like to see the settings also controlled via the app.I knew basically nothing about security cameras until I started researching. This camera appears to be the best value. After installing it, I do believe it is. Now that I&rsquo;m comfortable with my first camera, I plan to order 2 to 3 more cameras and install those. No doubt, the second third and fourth cameras will be a breeze to set up.Also, one good thing about the product literature is a step-by-step set of instructions for all the different settings. However, even with that, I still had questions about how everything worked together and needed tech-support give me a few pointers along the way. It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning tech support, is available all through the night, is based in China, and communicates in very good English.Lastly, as I look back on the entire process, the most challenging setting to get right was the motion detection sensitivity and tolerance settings. Therefore, I suggest the tech-support write a page or two in the manual and give some examples about how to set these particular settings. The &ldquo;cold&rdquo; trial and error that they suggest in the manual as it stands currently, takes way too long to work through. What one needs are a few examples of where to start, then do the trial and error, then finish. The installation and settings setting a lot faster than starting without examples.I&rsquo;ve only had the product for a couple of days and cannot speak to the long term longevity of the product. However, out of the box, installed, and settings now understood, I&rsquo;m excited to be able to use the product and hope to be able to use it for years to come.</p>

<h5 id="i-gave-it-a-1-because-zero-is-not-an">I gave it a 1 because zero is not an &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave it a 1 because zero is not an option.Software does not install from autorun. Three options present, one is exit. That&rsquo;s the only one that works.Manual install did run but I had to find it on the CD.Camera discovery does not work.Browsed to the camera and was able to enter setup, change the name of the camera, etc. Even viewed a live image. But cannot use the included software so no record, multi-camera views, etc.No response from email only tech &ldquo;help.&ldquo;Software download page displays in Chinese.Shipped the junk back the same day.</p>
