<h5 id="astounding-unbelievable-my-first-good-shower-in-6-months-before-and-after-photos">Astounding! Unbelievable! My first good shower in 6 months! Before and After Photos</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I moved into a mountain home six months ago. Our neighborhood is served by a community water tank. Neighbors who live way down at the bottom of the hill tell me the pressure is pretty good. But we live at the top of the hill and the pressure sucks.I just installed the Delta Water Amplifying shower head. Whereas with the previous shower head, the flow water never reached within 18 inches of the back wall, now it soaks the back wall. (See the photos.) I am finally getting a good shower again!I know we have little to complain about in this wonderful country, but I never knew how much I missed having a good shower. If you have low pressure, buy this shower head. You won&rsquo;t regret it.Key to the photos:Photo 1: No shower head. Note the low water pressurePhoto 2: Old shower head. Note the anemic flow.Photo 3: Delta 75152 shower head. Ahhhhhhhhh&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="prompted-a-first-product-review-from-an-old-cynic">Prompted a first product review, from an old cynic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m 57 and have never bothered to review a product before. This unit deserves one.I bought this to replace an old shower head, in an old house, in a city in MA, that is now rumored to have the highest water rates in the USA.My wife has a daily shower at 5am, and the noise of the flow through the copper pipes, apart from waking me up (and making me wanna go pee) seemed to go on for ever.Another problem that we had is that, after about 2 minutes, the cold water in the mix arrived from the old clay pipe water mains which are about 10 feet down. In granite. In New England. In winter. It would suddenly (and shockingly) drop the temperature to tepid.I did not expect a lot from an economical unit such as this.This unit has:1. Reduced the &ldquo;pipe noise&rdquo; level to where I thought initially my wife had given up showering!2. Produced an increase in water pressure and rinsing action that allows my wife to rinse her hair in a fraction of the time.3. Cut our water use bill by about 35%4. Nearly eliminated the cold water shock problem described.In short, I was so impressed that my 1st thought was to buy a lifetime supply of these just in case they stop making them!</p>

<h5 id="i-can-finally-get-my-hair-rinsed-completely">I can finally get my hair rinsed completely!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our old, small shower head just wasn&rsquo;t getting it done anymore when it came to rinsing shampoo and conditioner out of my thick hair: curses on the people who passed all the water-saving plumbing laws! Figured I&rsquo;d give this a try before heading to the black market to buy an illegal high-velocity fixture, I was that desperate. This shower head isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it definitely has enough power to leave me with properly rinsed hair. Great value for a pressure-improving shower head.Install is simple: remember you will need some Teflon pipe tape though. I dry-fitted the shower head first, to see approximately how much of the existing pipe would remain exposed&mdash;that way I didn&rsquo;t end up with a ton of white plumber&rsquo;s tape showing. Tighten it up, check for leaks, that&rsquo;s it. The hardest part of the install was probably getting the old shower head off.There&rsquo;s a little half-moon switch that can be moved up or down to adjust the water flow; it does make a change but it&rsquo;s not incredibly different (&ldquo;down&rdquo; = higher flow). The water comes out in big droplets, not a fine spray. Most importantly, I do still get good, consistent flow even when water is being used elsewhere for laundry, dishwasher, etc.My one star off is because I wish the spray pattern were just a little bigger, maybe 5 or 6 holes? I suppose that would also affect the flow, though. The fixture itself looks fine in a standard bathroom but it&rsquo;s not fancy enough for a spa-type decor.</p>

<h5 id="showers-aren-t-tedious-and-annoying-anymore">Showers aren&rsquo;t tedious and annoying anymore!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d been reading about this shower head for months before I finally ordered it. Let&rsquo;s just say that I wish I&rsquo;d ordered it long before I did!We had a Waterpik shower head before this one, and the pressure was awful. I had to spend 10 minutes trying to thoroughly rinse my hair sort of awful. I hated the waste of water involved with that as well. Anyway, I read overall glowing reviews for this on here, and decided for 20 bucks, why not give it a try?It&rsquo;s literally like a whole new shower experience! The pressure is great and it looks like it would be easy to clean the head itself if needed as it has 4 decently-sized holes that are easy to get at. I&rsquo;m alright with the 2 pressure settings (low and high). I&rsquo;ve found the low setting is more than encompassing enough. I don&rsquo;t find myself needing or wanting any other setting other than what it comes with. Easy installation, and classy looking, too! I would recommend this to anyone who is in the market for a good, powerful, water-saving shower head, and you just can&rsquo;t beat the price! I don&rsquo;t dread taking a shower anymore! It looks like Delta has a good lifetime warranty as well, so when this wears out, they&rsquo;ll replace it it seems.Good one, Delta!</p>

<h5 id="makes-a-world-of-difference-wouldn-t-be-able-to-shower-without-it">Makes a world of difference! Wouldn&rsquo;t be able to shower without it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I moved into a new apartment that had the worst water pressure for hot water ever. I was worried that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to shower well, and so I gave this thing a try, and bam!! Full water pressure and I am able to shower normally! Is it as good as a place that has good water pressure normally? Maybe not, but this makes it 80% of the way, which is phenomenal, considering it was at like 10% (if that) before.Thank you Delta for making this!!My only gripe would be that it isn&rsquo;t as wide of a spray and a bit narrower than the other showerheads (like waterpik), but I&rsquo;m assuming they had to do that to increase the water pressure.</p>
