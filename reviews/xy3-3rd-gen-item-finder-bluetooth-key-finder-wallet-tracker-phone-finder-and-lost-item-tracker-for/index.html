<p>The XY3 is small and lightweight enough to be attached to almost anything. It&rsquo;s a key finder, luggage tracker, wallet locator, pet finder, purse tracker - the possibilities are endless! It connects to your phone or tablet via a Bluetooth Low Energy signal and uses your phone&rsquo;s GPS to track its location.</p>

<p>Find Your Things With Your Phone
Always know where your things are with XY3. Use your phone&rsquo;s Bluetooth signal to make misplaced items beep, hunt them down with the signal indicator, or see the last known location on a map. With our KeepNear notification technology, you can even get an alert when you&rsquo;re leaving something important behind!</p>

<p>Find Your Phone With Your Things
The XY3 will make your lost phone ring, even if it&rsquo;s on silent! Just hold the button on your XY3 and your nearby phone will ring, so you can find it even if it&rsquo;s trapped between the couch cushions or buried in the laundry hamper.</p>

<p>Five Times Louder
The new XY3 is five times louder than before. That means even in a noisy room, you can hear your lost XY3.</p>

<p>KeepNear Alerts
Stop leaving valuables behind thanks to our KeepNear alert system. Your phone will notify you if your XY3 goes out of Bluetooth range.</p>

<p>Community Lost and Found
Can&rsquo;t find your XY3? Mark it as &ldquo;lost&rdquo; in the app and we&rsquo;ll send you a private notification with its location whenever an XY user is near your lost item.</p>

<p>Small, Stylish Design

<h5 id="i-ve-found-it">I&rsquo;ve Found It!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having used several location tracking products in the past, I can confirm that this has been the best experience I&rsquo;ve had so far! When travelling, I want to be sure that I know where my luggage is at all times, which now I can just throw my XY3 Find It into my suit case and keep track of it. I&rsquo;ll probably buy another one for my backpack. High quality and very accurate. Thanks!!!</p>

<h5 id="very-limited-use">Very Limited Use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think these things are really only useful if what you&rsquo;re looking for happens to be right next to you but you&rsquo;re just not seeing it (like in a couch crack or under a jacket). More than 1 room away, and it&rsquo;s either &ldquo;out of range&rdquo; or you can&rsquo;t hear the chime. And if it&rsquo;s right by you anyway, you probably would have found it with a bit more searching. So for me, it&rsquo;s just not that useful. Case in point&hellip;.I attached 1 to my keys, 1 to my spare key, and 1 to my daughter&rsquo;s phone (via a key ring attached to her rubber case). This was the one I was most excited for since she misplaces her phone a lot (usually in the house). However, the very first time she lost her phone, the XY3 was no help at all. It showed the last place her phone was seen as in the house, but when I pushed the &ldquo;beep&rdquo; button, it didn&rsquo;t beep and it said &ldquo;out of range.&rdquo; I walked over the entire house, car, garage, basement etc., pushing the &ldquo;beep&rdquo; button, and it never beeped or registered as being in range. Customer service said it has to be really close and have a visual line of sight to the phone I&rsquo;m searching with. So if I&rsquo;m that close AND I can see it, why do I need the XY3??General comments: Registering the tiles was confusing. What looked easy ended up taking 20 minutes plus an email to customer service, waiting for a reply, and then trying something different to get the app to read all 3. 1 tile appeared non-functional when I got it, but after removing the battery and putting it back in, it registered. The chime is not easily recognizable against background noise. It sounds more like a song than a beep or alarm, which would be very easy to hear. It&rsquo;s also not very loud.I did use another XY3 to successfully find my keys when they were buried in my purse, which was sitting right next to me. So these are not entirely useless. But since it didn&rsquo;t find my daughter&rsquo;s phone, which is pretty much why I bought it, I feel like it was a waste of money. I had high hopes for the XY3, but so far it has been a disappointment.</p>

<h5 id="completely-unreliable-and-it-burns-through-your-phone-battery-time">Completely unreliable&ndash;and it burns through your phone battery time.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really liked the idea of the XY3 3rd Gen Item Finder&ndash;a light, compact hexagonal disk that you can attach to your key chain and use it to find the location of a multitude of things&ndash;from your cell phone (which it will &ldquo;ring&rdquo; even when turned off) to those keys (which you can track down through the Bluetooth app, to, theoretically, your parked car.At least that&rsquo;s what they say on paper. Reality proved to be another thing altogether. The first sign of trouble was setting it up after you installed the app on your phone. It was less than intuitive, the instructions were insufficient and the actual app was tricky to navigate. After some trial and error I finally got it &ldquo;paired&rdquo; with my phone and my keys.I don&rsquo;t seem to have problems misplacing my keys as much as not remembering where I just put my phone down. I put the XY3 to the test, pushing the triangular button on the disc and, lo and bold, it activated a musical chime on my phone which was loud enough to locate. At least it did it the first time. I haven&rsquo;t gotten it to work again since.It also has been having issues showing where my keys were (they in the immediate vicinity&ndash;actually right beside the phone) when I test it. It will some of the time, but not others.The only thing the XY3 seems to be consistent in is running out my phone battery time, which it does quite efficiently if I don&rsquo;t remember to turn off the location finding.All in all, while a great product in theory, it&rsquo;s still got a long way to go in practice.</p>

<h5 id="these-do-not-work">These do not work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My boyfriend had the original Tiles that worked great, but you can&rsquo;t replace the battery so we decided to give these a shot when he needed to reorder new ones. Unfortunately these didn&rsquo;t reach from the living room to the bedroom of a small apartment, and they were not load enough to hear when they did work. We returned them and will stick with the Tiles.</p>

<h5 id="as-a-former-tile-owner-i-m-a-little-disappointed">As a former Tile owner, I&rsquo;m a little disappointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: Has same basic functionality and range as a TileHas replaceable battery unlike Tile.Is cheaper than Tile.Cons: Battery only lasts about 3 months for meSeems to be a battery killer on iPhone unless you kill the app and disable location services. Tile was not so bad, but also had an impact.</p>
