<h5 id="a-very-useful-and-reasonably-priced-tool">A VERY USEFUL AND REASONABLY PRICED TOOL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I combine this with a D Addario string winder bit and it makes changing strings on my guitars and basses much easier, more fun and I get a better tighter wrap around the machine heads.I love giving these as gifts, people think it&rsquo;s a great tool and it feels more expensive than it is.The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is they no longer ship with a double ended screwdriver bit (one phillips and one straight end). They now include two separate bits which are much easier to lose or misplace.A set of batteries lasts a long time too. I have several of these screwdrivers around the house, we use them all the time. In my recording studio I use this for racking up equipment, it&rsquo;s a great way to put in rack screws, not as inclined to strip threads as a powerful electric drill driving a screwdriver bit.Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="a-huge-time-saver-life-saver-wish-i-d-gotten-this-cordless-electric-screwdriver-years-ago">A HUGE Time-Saver &amp; Life-Saver &ndash; Wish I&rsquo;d Gotten This Cordless Electric Screwdriver YEARS Ago!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>l got this Black &amp; Decker Cordless Screwdriver last year, after my mom had a stroke in August, and I needed to do some small repairs/fix-its/installations &amp; other &ldquo;honey-do list&rdquo; type stuff (like putting in a closet organizer/shelves, etc.) around the house to make things safer and easier for my mom to manage with decreased mobility &amp; other issues.Until last year, I&rsquo;d always used only manual screwdrivers whenever a screwdriver was needed for any tasks. I don&rsquo;t know why it never occurred to me to get an electric screwdriver, but it just didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d been using manual screwdrivers for years, and though I hadn&rsquo;t really had any problem with them, per sé, using them was pretty time-consuming &ndash; and since I had several tasks around the house to complete preferably before my mom came home from the hospital (actually the rehab center she&rsquo;d been admitted to, after she was discharged from the hospital) I was in a major &ldquo;time crunch&rdquo; and thought that using a manual screwdriver for everything that needed to be done, would take way too long.So, in order to save the time, energy &amp; effort of manually screwing in countless number of screws (for all the various tasks necessitating use of a screwdriver) I got this Black &amp; Decker Cordless Screwdriver&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.and I am GLAD that I did!This battery-operated cordless electric screwdriver is pretty simple &amp; easy to use. It has two buttons (one on either side of the handle) to easily switch between installing screws and removing them with forward and reverse buttons. This screwdriver comes with 2 &ldquo;bits&rdquo; &ndash; one of them for flat-head screws, and the other for Phillips-head screws and they pretty much just snap into place in the specific slot.All in all this is a great screwdriver, and saved/saves a LOT of time &amp; frustration when installing shelves, and doing other small home improvements/repairs. The only reason I gave this Black &amp; Decker Cordless Screwdriver 4 stars instead of 5 is because rather than putting both the flat-head screwdriver and the Phillips-head screwdriver on either side of one &ldquo;bit&rdquo; (so that both types would remain in the drill at all times) instead they put it on two separate &ldquo;bits&rdquo;. So only one of the &ldquo;bits&rdquo; can be in the drill at a particular time, and since they are so small they&rsquo;re much harder to keep track of.Other than that, this is a GREAT cordless electric screwdriver &ndash; especially for such a low price!★☆★☆ 4 STARS!!!!!</p>

<h5 id="pretty-good">Pretty good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little puppy is actually better than I thought it would be. It has enough power to impress me, that is with batteries at full charge. I replaced some screws that were longer and this little thing pushed them through the wood pretty good. I really like the collar lock which locks it so it can be used as a regular screwdriver to finish the last little bit. I have to take a star off because why would they not find someway to include a place for the other bit! I am using rubber bands to attach the second drill bit and it looks kind of crummy and is inconvenient. I also do not see any place on Amazon where I can get additional drill bits in this size. But all in all this is a pretty good tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-good-but-could-be-better">Really Good but could be better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very good, not nearly as fast as if you use a drill/driver, but plenty good enough for odd jobs. I like that you can easily switch directions by pushing a different button, you don&rsquo;t need to move your whole hand. I have an older model which requires using 2nd hand or changing grip to change rotation direction and it&rsquo;s kind of a hassle, so I like this feature.I do wish there was onboard storage somewhere for the extra bit, or a 2 sided one that you can just flip over to switch between flat and Philips. It is annoying to have to dig around toolbox for the other bit. I couldn&rsquo;t believe there wasn&rsquo;t a place to clip the other bit on somewhere, so I even read the instructions. What a shocker that was, you won&rsquo;t believe how many instructions there are for a screwdriver; who knew it was such a complex piece of machinery! But no place to store the extra bit. Strange. Comes with 4 McNair brand batteries included.</p>

<h5 id="handy-device-for-driving-in-a-screw-without-stripping-or-slipping-off-the-screw">Handy device for driving in a screw without stripping or slipping off the screw.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this little guy. I have several cordless power drills. Even with the torque limiting feature of them and the variable speed trigger it is still hard to drive in screws without stripping them or the bit slipping off the screw head. Not with this little guy. It has low gears to give it the torque to drive in a screw but at a consistence slower speed that helps keep the bit on the screw with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-silly-redundant-product-that-i-don-t-know-how-i-lived-without-d">a silly, redundant product that I don&rsquo;t know how I lived without :D</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only bothered to get this since I&rsquo;d used a friend&rsquo;s (different brand), and it was a cheap add-on item. It seemed like a silly thing to waste money on, since i have plenty of other tools that&rsquo;ll turn a screw - most way stronger. This thing is GREAT, though. It is so incredibly convenient to have something barely bigger than a plain screwdriver in your back pocket for times when you didn&rsquo;t expect to even need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stripped-the-gearbox-probably">Stripped the gearbox, probably</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like a lot of things about it, and it seemed rugged. Perhaps I took things a little too far trying to tighten some <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; bolts with it. In either case, it appears that some gear or something inside must have stripped. It has absolutely no torque anymore, and it just slips ineffectually at the first sign of resistance.I ran it with Eneloop rechargeable batteries and it worked fine. I would return it, but I guess it was sort of my fault that it&rsquo;s broken considering the larger hardware I was trying to use it on. Either way, I&rsquo;m slightly less than impressed with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-it">Get it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Real men will think this is a toy. It is not a toy. It&rsquo;s really a very handy tool that I use all the time. Beats breaking out the drill (screw gun).</p>

<p>Love that it uses regular batteries. I do not use it often so not having to recharge a battery when I need to use it is a big plus. Excellent for an occasional user.</p>
