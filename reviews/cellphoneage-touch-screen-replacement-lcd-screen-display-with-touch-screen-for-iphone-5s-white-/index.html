What should I pay attention before I am getting started the iPhone installation? 9 pts.You must know.
#1 Watch through installation video tutorial before getting started. There are many of these tutorials in YouTube.
#2 Make sure you power off your phone before starting the repair work.
#3 Make sure you have read through the installation instruction printed on the packaging box.
#4 Perform the replacement under a electro-static discharge (ESD) free environment. Wear a anti-static wrist strap or put a anti-static mat on the working table to prevent any ESD damage on your phone device.White and zebra strip lines sometimes results because of ESD as well.If you are not confident about that, we suggest you to locate a repair shop at your neighbourhood.
#5 Cover up any metal bare connections around the flex cable with Kapton tape to avoid any &lsquo;short-out&rsquo;.
#6 The LCD screen assembly is fragile and please don’t crack the 4 corners and the area right under the flex cables.
#7 Check whether there is any dust or debris in between the flex cables and motherboard. Clear them with brush or alcohol dipped cloth.
#8 Don&rsquo;t bend the flex cables.
#9 Make sure the flex cable is properly connected with a &ldquo;click&rdquo; sound.Don&rsquo;t force the connector together until they are properly lined up</p>

<h5 id="great-start-horrible-finish-look-elsewhere-for-a-screen">Great start, horrible finish. Look elsewhere for a screen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed to replace a cracked screen on an iPhone 5S and took a gamble on this low end replacement.The Good:1.) Packaged well in a clam-shell case and came with a free tool set.2.) I was impressed with the resolution and it still had a better picture then the screen I bought afterwards.3.) Cost effective.The Bad:1.) Not the same clarity of a Retina display.2.) Tools set is not even of middle quality. Don&rsquo;t expect to use them more then once and maybe not even that.3.) As noted by others, this display only lasted just over three months before the heating/cooling cycle of charging the battery caused the adhesive holding the digitizer to the screen to fail. And no, once that happens there&rsquo;s no way to fix it. If you notice that the screen is starting to have touch response issues, then you better order in a replacement right away. That happens shortly before failure.4.) Contacting the company who sold this item through Amazon about the problem resulted in this response: &ldquo;Thanks for getting back to us but sorry to tell you that Since Our products are Fulfilled by Amazon, which product&rsquo;s replace/exchange, return and refund are responsible by Amazon. Hope you can understand.&rdquo; So, they take absolutely no responsibility for this screen and don&rsquo;t care a bit about quality, durability or customer satisfaction.If you only need a screen for a month or two, then sure, go ahead. But if you don&rsquo;t fancy going through the process of replacing your screen again, look elsewhere.</p>

<h5 id="bad-digitizer-to-start-off-with">Bad Digitizer to start off with.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really disappointed. You can check my account if you need to. I have been repairing phones on a daily basis. First of all, the packaging was decent, looked professional. The connectors however, for the digitizer did not work. I tried 6 different broken screens and it worked just fine. LCD looks to have good coloration. Disappointed because now i have to go and send it back and wait for a new one. I&rsquo;m in the midst of switching part providers and moving my store, hence why I am buying from Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-kit-and-instructional-video">Excellent kit and instructional video!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very informative and truly detailed instructional video. Screen quality and resolution appears to be on par with OEM. Repair went smoothly overall and am happy with the results. If you need a sharper point spudger than what is included in the kit, try using a small wooden toothpick. Seemed to be just the trick for two of the steps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="suitable-short-term-solution-but-look-elsewhere-for-a-better-option">Suitable short term solution but look elsewhere for a better option.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen works. Which is good. It came with nice tools and packaging which was also nice. There are a few problems with this screen though. First it is a polarized glass or some variety that makes looking at it with polarized sunglasses next to impossible. This is a problem that the original OEM screen did not have. Second is that there is a very bright spot in the middle of the screen at all times, as if there is an uneven LED spread. Third, and the biggest problem, is that touch responsiveness from the digitizer is inaccurate. Sometimes when I touch one place it touches elsewhere. Or if I scroll up sometimes the screen jumps down. I&rsquo;m willing to say this may have been an installation problem, however I&rsquo;ve installed many screens before and never had this happen. Overall though, it&rsquo;s a suitable replacement if you just have to stretch your phone&rsquo;s life a bit longer.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-screen-quality-flawless-digitizer">Excellent Screen Quality &amp; Flawless Digitizer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen quality is excellent and digitizer works flawlessly. It took me about 90 minutes to install and was greatly helped by watching an instructional YouTube video (made all the difference for installation). Just installed today, so I have no history for reliability, but if I encounter issues, I will update my review. But so far the screen quality is excellent (indistinguishable from my original screen from Apple). Really pleased with product - thanks to the guys that make this!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stay-away">Stay away!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Poor fit. The screen did not fit nearly as nice as the original. It may be have been from my poor phone frame. But I would NOT recormmend this screen because within only a few days the screen started ha being dead spots. Where when I tap a portion of the screen nothing would happen.I have not tried to contact the seller at this point. Will update when I do.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-an-extremely-tough-job-not-for-the-short-tempered">This is an extremely tough job. Not for the short tempered</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This job is extremely hard. Dont listen to anyone that says this is an easy job, believe me its not. Went to the web site to watch the tutorial, and couldn&rsquo;t find a tutorial. But they made sure they got my email address so they could send me their junk mail. Thank god for YouTube, or I&rsquo;d have never finish. Took me seven hour, and about 11000 F bombs. I also had a magnifying hobby lamp to help out, because all the part are very tiny.I am a professional mechanic 20 years, and I will never do this job again. Next time I&rsquo;ll go to a professional and let them lose their mind trying to fix this thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a decent screen, although the lighting of it is a little differently colored than if you buy a new iPhone 5s or se (it works for both). Have had some glitching issues when I drag on the screen with my fingers, but that might be because I messed up a little on instillation. Also, the parts for prying up the screen and other components to start removing components, reinstall them later or replace them with the new screen are a little crappy, but the screwdrivers worked fine.</p>
