<h5 id="this-is-legit-the-best-wireless-speaker-i-have-ever-purchased">This is legit the BEST wireless speaker I have ever purchased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is legit the BEST wireless speaker I have ever purchased!! Ok so it has a little weight to it, but it still floats!! It has the hook so you can clip it to yourself of bag or something, but it floats!! You wouldnt think so because of the weight. The buttons on top are easy to operate, and they respond easily. Now the sound: HOLY CRAP! it gets super loud, the bass is amazing! You would think the sound is coming from an actual stereo system, not this speaker! It is waterproof, I submerged it and it was perfectly fine. In fact, you could hear the music underwater too. I am in love!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-size-bluetooth-boom-box">Good size bluetooth boom box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good size bluetooth boom box. The color and design are nice too. Sound tested are pretty clear so far, better than expected. I use it to listen to music in my home gym and the bass and sound are strong and solid enough. Good product for the money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-amazing-bluetooth-speaker">An amazing Bluetooth speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love this wireless Bluetooth speaker. It puts out an amazing amount of sound for being so small. It sounds much bigger than it is.To start off with, it was very easy to pair with my Samsung S7. The audio streams crystal clear with no issues at all. The sound is amazing as I said before. The mids, highs and lows are all very clear. Even better this is waterproof so you can use it in the shower or take it outside and not worry about getting caught in the rain.Overall this is a great product and I would highly recommend it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waterproof-bluetooth-speaker">Waterproof Bluetooth speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>very small in size- easy clip on and carry- can be used in shower or beach or in rain- don&rsquo;t go on the size, it packs a punch in sound department</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="boomin-bass">Boomin Bass</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The bass is booming! This speaker is very simple to maneuver. 5 button control volume up and down, pause/play, phone and power on/off. The buttons do require a nice firm press.Connecting to bluetooth was also a breeze. The distance is the best I have come across thus far, much stronger than the bluetooth in my car.This baby is very sturdy. I did a drop test about 5 times at 3 feet and the speaker covers began to pop off. However it was vey easy to pop it back into place and left no physical or function damage.I also tested the waterproof aspect. It passed and no water seeped through, the speaker still played perfectly. I would love for sound to come out of both sides of the speaker but unfortunately it does not. Also the phone feature is not as loud as the media play back. Ultimately I would recommend this speaker. View the video for a live demo. Oh this is much louder than my BRV-1 and half the price</p>

<h5 id="i-must-admit-when-i-actually-saw-it-s-size-i-was-kind-of-disappointed-until-i-heard-all-of-that-sound-coming-from">I must admit when I actually saw it&rsquo;s size I was kind of disappointed until I heard all of that sound coming from &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the little speaker that COULD, I must admit when I actually saw it&rsquo;s size I was kind of disappointed until I heard all of that sound coming from this lil brick, it has excellent highs and just as good bass without almost any distortion, I highly recommend this speaker to all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound-quality">Great Sound Quality!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this because I recently lost my bluetooth speaker and I really missed listening to music in the shower that was louder than my phone speaker. When I got this I had to instantly test it out. I turned it on and it was super easy to pair with my phone. I wasn&rsquo;t sure about how good the sound quality was going to be because it wasn&rsquo;t a $100 speaker. I was greatly surprised when I turned it on and the sound quality was great! It is super easy to use. It has so many thing you can do like skip a song or answer an incoming call. I like it so much that I am even listening to it right now as I write this review!! I also think it is super convenient that it comes with a aux cord too because some phones might not be able to connect via bluetooth so this is super helpful.</p>

<h5 id="this-speaker-is-pretty-cool-i-bought-it-because-i-gave-my">This speaker is pretty cool! I bought it because I gave my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This speaker is pretty cool!I bought it because I gave my JBL Speaker to my sister since she said she needed one. This speaker is close to the JBL but half the price! I love the sound and the button functions. The JBL speaker I had allowed me to do almost similar features that this one can do but the Apie Speaker does more. In this you are able to pause, turn up or down the volume, change to the next or previous song, answer and reject calls and basic Bluetooth hook up. My Old JBL speaker could only do a few of those things. Sound wise. The speaker is super loud! and powerful! I had it for three weeks now and still amazed at how powerful it is. I only charged it 3 times since I had it. I use it when I drive in my truck going to and from work or if I drive around. So it gets a good amount of use. Wanna say maybe 40 mins a day.There a few things I noticed about it that kinda eh but not that big of a deal.One of the things I noticed is that the volume doesn&rsquo;t seem to sync well with iPhones or at least maybe my iPhone. it seems to delay a little so for example, I could have three volume bars and turn it up two more bars and then the Bluetooth will be communication that with the speaker and it&rsquo;ll delay and turn it down. making me have to turn it up again so the speaker can turn up itself.Overall I like the speaker. Think its good for the price. it the volume thing doesn&rsquo;t bother you I suggest getting it.</p>
