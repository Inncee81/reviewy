<h5 id="sturdy-sleek-affordable-mount-that-does-exactly-what-you-need">Sturdy, sleek, affordable mount that does exactly what you need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this mount for my Optoma HD141x; it looks and works great! Assembly was easy, and the included wall anchors did the trick since I don&rsquo;t have a ceiling stud at the mounting location. Unfortunately one of the screw holes was stripped, so the set screw wouldn&rsquo;t tighten fully. But most set screws install in pairs so the mount is nevertheless sturdy and I was able to easily align the projected image to my screen.I guess my only complaint (if I had to make one) is that, after installing, I realized that the mount is a little too tall for my setup. I know it&rsquo;s my bad for incorrectly measuring, and the minimum length of the extension rod is clearly advertised, so I&rsquo;m definitely not docking my rating for this. But it would be nice if they included the basic topmost joint from the VP01 model in this kit, so that I could opt to not use the extension rod at all.The attached pictures show how the mounting feet attached to my projector. Since the HD141x has 3 mount holes, one of the mount&rsquo;s feet should be removed. The other 3 attach according to the pics, in order to center the base plate over the projector&rsquo;s &ldquo;do not throw away&rdquo; picture of a trash can. (you&rsquo;ll know what I mean if you have this projector) The mounting feet fit PERFECTLY onto the projector&rsquo;s mount holes.</p>

<h5 id="really-solid-projector-mount-at-a-great-price">Really solid projector mount at a great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought a VIVO monitor mount last year and loved it. When I had a need for a small projector mount I remembered that fact and found this little guy. Really can&rsquo;t beat it for the price. Comes with all the hardware you&rsquo;d need and some extra as well. Includes the allen key as well. It&rsquo;s very sturdy, has a lot of adjustments and looks very sleek. It was a little finicky to assemble myself. Could have used a third hand perhaps but once assembled it did the trick. Also, my projector only had three mounting holes but I was able to swing the 4th arm around underneath and line up the other three arms. Definitely would recommend VIVO products so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-mount">I love this mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This ceiling mount is great. I don&rsquo;t see myself getting another projector, but if I did, I would buy this mount again. The construction is really good and sturdy. It is an attractive design and it hides the cords beautifully. It&rsquo;s very adjustable to help get your projector dialed in how you want it.Pros:Attractive designHighly adjustableClear instructionsLooks professionalCons:The provided lag screws are a little too long (see below)This will probably only apply to a very specific situation. The mounting point for our projector was in between two joist and the lag screws provided were long. We have a floating laminate flooring on top of a 3/4IN OSB sub-floor. I cut a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> x 12 x 16 piece of plywood as a substrate (I&rsquo;m sure you can see where this is going). Upon mounting the bracket with the lags through the ceiling I check upstairs and realized I had pushed the flooring up in a 14 x 12 area. I ended up removing the lags and using shorter ones which we already had. This was the only issue that I encountered with the installation and it was on my end.</p>

<h5 id="incredibly-hard-to-mount-but-works-great">Incredibly hard to mount, but works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Measure the arm attachments and lock them in, but deatch the projector an attach it to the bottom feet LASTI used this to cross about 5.5 inches (with projector 2.5 inches to the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> joist) and it didn&rsquo;t really move at all. Very sturdy. Turns out all of my joists are metal and the places I thought were joists were thin wood and dry wall. Not magnetic too, totally threw me off. Anyways, I re-mounted this thing again and mounted the projector last, no problems at all. This mount is legit because it goes up and down so much. Could probably stash it a little safer while having guests over, but it can take a few mins to line up again.&mdash;&mdash; old review &mdash;&ndash;The screw plates should be attached to the main pole, because it&rsquo;s almost impossible to set this up with so many moving washersI ended up taping the plates inside and doing the top 2 before the remaining 2 underneath</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="read-the-description-carefully">Read the description carefully</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this specifically because it said distance between mounting holes should be 12.5 inches or less. The greatest distance between mounting holes on my projector is about 12 inches, and this mount extended all the way reaches just under that. I was able to fabricate extension plates and make it work but I wouldn&rsquo;t have purchased this if the description was correctI see I&rsquo;m not the first to have this issue. It&rsquo;s asinine the seller neglects to update the descriptionActually, I&rsquo;m wrong:Important Note: As mentioned above the mounting arms for this projector mount have a maximum reach of 12.5”. Before purchasing, be sure to find the mounting holes on top of your projector and measure the distance between each one (especially the ones diagonal from one another). If all diagonals measure 12.5” or less then this mount will fit your projector.I did not measure the diagonal distance, only the longest length - so my mistake BUT this is confusing as you need to dig into the product description below to find this excerpt. The first sentence under the product description says:UNIVERSAL MOUNTING fitting the majority of projectors on the market. Distance between mounting holes on back of projector must be 12.5” or lessThis should be changed to reflect the importance of measuring the DIAGONAL distance.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-value-mount-ever">The best value mount ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes value means compromises, but not with this mount. At 17 bucks, I was SO happy to find this on amazon after looking at alternatives in big box stores (10x the price). All I needed was a mount to ceiling mount my projector in our living room, and this did a very adequate job.The installation was a bit of a challenge, but I think that was the nature of mounting something on the ceiling rather than the device itself. It&rsquo;s amazing that it&rsquo;s universal, and although it took some messing around we did get 3 of the 4 mounts to screw into our projector.The controls for adjusting up and down was alright, took a bit of messing around with the screws, but ultimately we found what worked and we haven&rsquo;t touched it since. My projector hasn&rsquo;t fallen on my head in the last half year, and for 17 bucks I think that&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t quite fit my Epson project. It is only in 3 rather than 4 or 5 holes. It wasn&rsquo;t big enough. Is still holding it up, but far less securely than I would like.</p>
