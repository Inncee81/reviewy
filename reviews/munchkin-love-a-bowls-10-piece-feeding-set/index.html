<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-but-lid-issue">Good..but lid issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The lids (at least my batch) does not go on easily. If one has arthritis or equivalent then it would be really difficult to work with these lids. I fought to close with lids for over 10 minutes. Each time I closed one area, another just pops out and repeat. Even placing your hand over the top fully didn&rsquo;t force it to close evenly. Other than that, they are nice compact bowls and nice long spoons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pro-is-tight-lids-cons-is-tight-lids">Pro is tight lids&hellip;cons is TIGHT lids</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love that this item has so many pieces. However I noticed in one of the reviews that they said that the lids were tight. I didn&rsquo;t realize how tight they are because they are easy to split. See the picture. I am disappointed because I&rsquo;ve only used these one time and it&rsquo;s already damaged period on a good note even with top big split it still holds tightly to the bowl. I make baby food for my granddaughter and freeze it. So these lidded bowls are great to slowly thaw her food in the fridge. Unfortunately I&rsquo;m going to have to return it. As you can see from the picture the lid is almost completely split and I don&rsquo;t think it will hold up much longer. Nice concept but I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to go back to the drawing board.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bowls-are-great-for-homemade-baby-purees-and-finger-food">Bowls are great for homemade baby purees, and finger food!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like these bowls a lot. I currently use them, to store finger food, for my 12 month old. Before storing finger food, I would put our homemade purees in these bowls. I like that they are microwave and dishwasher safe. We use them so much, that we had to buy another set. My only complaint, is we dropped one and the lid shattered into pieces. Some of the other lids as well, are starting to crack. Sometimes, the lids are hard to place onto the bowls, because it has a good seal. I really like the spoons, that come with these bowls. The spoons are very soft, and flexible, making it easy to put in the babies mouth. They are small though, so they&rsquo;re better suited when first starting purees. Overall, I really like this set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bowls-put-them-on-your-must-buy-list">Great bowls, put them on your must buy list</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love these bowls. They don&rsquo;t spill at all, something I found after I dropped a bowl containing runny rice cereal on the kitchen floor. No spills! The lids are a tad difficult to snap on, but the mechanism ensures&hellip;well, no spills (don&rsquo;t hate me).I prefer the spoons that came with the bowls, instead of the best selling Munchkin spoons. The spoons are made of a softer material and are shaped such that my 7 month old doesn&rsquo;t have to struggle to eat (unlike the other Munchkin spoons which have a scoop shape). My baby loves taking the spoon in her hands and shoving it in her mouth, and these don&rsquo;t hurt her.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-set-small-size">Good Set, Small Size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bowls are a little smaller than I was expecting them to be after seeing the product photo. One reviewer photo where someone is holding one shows a better depiction. They&rsquo;ll be great for now while my baby is just starting out eating, and also for small snacks for travel, but definitely not big enough for when baby gets older.The spoons seems like a perfect size for beginning feeding. My son isn&rsquo;t old enough to eat himself yet, but I could see these working for self-feeding a little too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hard-to-close">Hard to close</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like these and I think they sell for a great price but the lids are really hard to push over the bowl. I will say once the lid is on nothing will leak out at all! I like that these do great in my dishwasher and I can pop them in the microwave or even toss them in the freezer. These are great o have on hand and I may even order some more but just know that it takes a lot of effort to get these to seal closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="useful-and-super-cute">Useful and super cute</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are no doubt really super cute perfect sized bowls and are great for baby&rsquo;s snacks. These are the perfect size for portions for a kid from 6 months to toddler age. I use dishwasher with them and they did well. I like they are so useful. I even bought second time to gift.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lids-are-a-little-tight">Lids are a little tight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to point out that the lids on these bowls are very hard to put on. First you definitely need two hands to do it and even then it is a struggle. As if the lids are too small&hellip; I did sterilize the set in steaming hot water so may be that shrunk the plastic, I don&rsquo;t know. On a positive note, once they are on, they are on! No leaking issues even if the whole thing drops on the floor, which has happened a few times.The spoons are cute and nice and small for the baby&rsquo;s mouth. For the bowls they came with they work fine. But I tried to use them with other bowls, the ones that have a suction on the bottom, and they do not stay in the bowl. They are not weighted right so if you want ot leave the spoon in the bowl you cannot, it falls out and makes a mess. But as I said, for the bowls they came with they work fine.Still this is a good set of bowls and spoons. I love the bright colors. We use them daily with my baby.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-set">Perfect set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this set so much I&rsquo;m buying another one. The bowls are perfectly sized for my 9 month old&rsquo;s daycare food. The low profile lets me stack them up in our fridge drawer easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The lids did not fit the bolws ðŸ˜’</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-set-works-fine-for-me">This set works fine for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set works fine for me. My baby is using a bigger bowl now and I use these little bowls so pack his snack, with the lid they work for me on-the-go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-spoons-and-perfect-size-plates">Love these spoons and perfect size plates.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these bowls and spoons! These spoons are the best to feed my baby he loves them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-set">Great Set !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this bowl/lid set with the bonus spoons. These are great to put snacks in for on the go, and I love that they&rsquo;re BPA free and can go in the microwave.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-love-these">I don&rsquo;t love these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We never use the spoons. I don&rsquo;t like that they are plastic. Ended up buying silicone spoons for baby since she likes to grab and chew on them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="corlorful-never-leak-when-go-out-bring-baby">Corlorful, never leak. when go out bring baby &hellip;</h5>

<p>Super happy with Munchkin bowls, but why only 2 spoons? I love their spoons, they are so cute &amp; fit into my little One&rsquo;s mouth at 6 months while some are either too small or too&hellip;</p>
