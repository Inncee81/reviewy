Get the most out of your home audio system by ensuring the best connection from your speaker cable to your receiver with the Sewell Deadbolt Banana plugs. Using self crimping teeth these plugs provide a simple, secure, and low profile connection without requiring soldering or screws. These 1.6‚Äù inch plugs are extremely low profile making it so you can put your speakers or receiver closer to the wall. Unlike other banana plugs that use low quality metals like zinc alloy the Sewell Deadbolt Banana plugs use pure copper and high quality brass with 24k gold plating. Installation One of the best things about the Deadbolt Banana Plugs is that installation is quick, secure, and requires no tools. Just follow these steps. Feed the cable through the bottom piece. Push the cable back over the teeth on the bottom piece. Screw the top piece to the bottom one. You&rsquo;re finished. All in all you should only need 10-20 seconds for this entire operation. What Are Banana Plugs? Today, many electronics use the banana plug interface, also known as binding post (referring to this connection in its female form). This female binding post connection that accepts this banana plug is found commonly on virtually all audio/video receivers, speaker wall plates, and more. Banana plugs offer an alternative to inserting a bare speaker wire into the equipment. Often a bare speaker connection is not as reliable as a guaranteed banana plug connection. Wires tend to get pulled out or frizzy after time passes. Banana plugs require only one install, giving you a permanent and robust connector at the end of your speaker wire.</p>

<h5 id="disappointed-contact-crushes-probe-not-resilient-metal">Disappointed,Contact crushes,Probe NOT resilient metal.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Other reviewers have mentioned the metal contact probe won&rsquo;t spring back after repeated use and unfortunately that&rsquo;s truth . Just one time inserting plug in a speaker/amp jack &amp; removing it results in a loose less than secure connection, the probe crushes and doesn&rsquo;t spring back after the initial insertion, it&rsquo;s spent.If you&rsquo;re a perfectionist about audio you&rsquo;ll be sending these back. The contact crushes and will not return to original shape.I guess the majority of folks stick these together &amp; forget about them &amp; that&rsquo;s why so many people give high marks.I&rsquo;m using mine wth a Yamaha RX-A660 AV tuner and a 7.2 channel Klipsch reference speaker setup &amp; had to be very careful with my wire routings so I didn&rsquo;t have to remove them.For now they&rsquo;ll have to suffice but I&rsquo;m in the market for some quality plugs that can be cycled.In the past I&rsquo;ve used a more classic style with dual set screws or the bfa type with non conductive plastic sheath. I found some here marketed by &ldquo;eastone&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t cost an arm and a leg.If you have an application where you&rsquo;ll be changing your configuration and needing to plug/unplug these won&rsquo;t hold up.If you look close at the probe design the split/ flared section represents a smaller area compared to others where the whole probe is segmented &amp; expanded, so maybe it&rsquo;s the design &amp; not the material.The bottom line is that I&rsquo;m not going to settle for an inferior product, especially when I have so much invested in every other component.I&rsquo;m not here to beat up on this product but I feel compelled to join the other reviewers to let you know the shortcomings.Other than the above issue the design is adequate, the way the wire locks in is good and the body is solid metal with a grippy rubber strip, but is conductive and being a fat diameter run the risk of shorting against its neighbor.I regret buying these and have asked to return them.Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t recommend this product.Two stars because they do work once.</p>

<h5 id="the-super-convinient-easy-to-install-banaplug-of-my-dreams">The Super Convinient, easy to install banaplug of my dreams</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:Much more compact than my old Monster dual banana plugs - won&rsquo;t add too much length to the back of your amp (maybe an inch or so).Grips the wire REAL tight and inserts without fuss - even when length was a little too long / shortNice heavy quality feelStupid simple installation and can take &ldquo;typical&rdquo; 16 ga or even 12 ga wire.Looks nicer than bare wire when you are doneReusable when and if you want to re-wire somedayOh ya - plug head rotates so that they don&rsquo;t unscrew themselves when they move around a bit.Cons:A little pricey (over a buck a plug)Color coding done with cheap stickers - you lose those (and you will eventually), and you lose some convenience (my wire was already poorly indicated)I bought these mainly because my aging Yamaha receiver will literally shut itself off if it doesn&rsquo;t like the way I&rsquo;ve jammed bare wire under its cheap plastic posts. I&rsquo;ve also gotten everything hooked up and heard a little static - argh, must the thing be so picky? It is also a tad frustrating to get everything all hooked up in a tidy way with bare wire and 5-way posts anyway. I&rsquo;ve accumulated quite a few speakers and wanted to be able to quickly re-assign them to different channels of my different amps. Banana plugs are the most convenient way to do that by far. These plugs seem like the best choice aside from the cheap color-coding. Just easy to install, super-snug tight, and pretty good looking. Smart design by some genius who deserves a raise.</p>

<h5 id="fantastically-simple-and-effective-product">Fantastically simple and effective product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a new receiver after about 15 years. LOL! I was going to just run the speaker wire into the speaker inlets (which it had an option to do) but I thought I&rsquo;d try the Sewell Banana plugs instead. Reasonably priced on Amazon and I&rsquo;m so glad that I bought them! I watched some YouTube videos on how to install them and it couldn&rsquo;t have been simpler. Took no time to connect the Sewell Banana plugs to each wire and they attached and worked great in my new receiver! I connected a heavy gauge wire for my front speaker and a very thin gauge wire to my back speakers. I was afraid that my thin gauge wires wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;grab&rdquo; to the banana plugs but there was no problem! I&rsquo;ll probably get heavier gauge for these speakers in the future but overall I had a great experience with the Sewell Banana plug speaker connectors! I would highly recommend them to anyone!</p>

<h5 id="ingenious-design-saves-time-during-installation">Ingenious design saves time during installation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has a clever integrated screw-in-body design that allows hooking up one of these plugs to a cable in a fraction of the time it takes with the more traditional screw or soldered post designs. Saved time becomes significant considering it takes 16 of these puppies to connect a 7.1 speaker home theater rig.Banana plugs also remove the guesswork from threading a cable into a receiver&rsquo;s binding posts by touch in the tight confines of a AV cabinet or in a speaker tucked between furniture.I was surprised that it took the relatively thick 14 AWG cable quite well. No soldering of the cable tips is needed or recommended for this gauge. However, for a cable this thick, it is somewhat difficult to get the plug teeth to catch a previously tinned cable.On the other hand, for 16 or 18 AWG cable, being thinner, I recommend tinning the ends of the cable and bending to a J with nose pliers prior to installing for a positive grip.I was resistant to use banana plugs before, but this design won me over.</p>

<h5 id="really-like-em">Really Like &lsquo;em</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love how easily they can be connected. Got these to hook up a home theater speaker system and they worked wonderfully. Used both 14GA and 12GA speaker wire and these plugs were able to accommodate them. I didn&rsquo;t plan well and ended up buying three 6-pair packs. Had I known what my final layout was going to be, I would have bought the 12-pair pack and saved a few bucks. I liked them enough that I ended up switching out the older banana plugs in the stereo system with these also.One of the plugs didn&rsquo;t fit in to the speaker jack and I just used a different plug from the same package and it worked.</p>
