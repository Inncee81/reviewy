<h5 id="great-wire-at-a-great-price">Great Wire at a Great Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These wires were exactly as advertised. They work fantastically with my Blu-ray, xbox 360, and HD Cable. I am getting 1080p signal with the Blu-ray and Xbox. The cable is coming in at 1080i and 720p which is the highest res available to me. I appreciate the no frills packaging which was just sealed clear plastic bags. The price was great less than $5 per cable and $7 to ship expedited (1-3 days). Four wires for less than the cheapest one at walmart and best buy. The best buy guy tried to sell me a mid range $70 cable saying not to trust a cheap one but 1080p is 1080p. Since I needed four cables even if I went with the cheap one at the store I saved around a $100 and had I gone with the suggested one I saved $250. Don&rsquo;t be fooled into packaging and store displays. If it can wait just a couple of days save the money.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a great product and with excellent quality. I received it very quickly. I bought this product to replace the current product I’m using in the same category and I must say that it definitely does the job better than I ever would’ve thought. Packaging, materials are all top notch and above my exceptions. I found this product by accident and decided to give it a shot and I couldn’t be happier. It’s lightweight and durable. I don’t believe I will be switching products anytime soon. If you’re contemplating on buying this product I’d definitely give it a shot, I don’t think you will be disappointed!</p>

<h5 id="bad-customer-service">Bad customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I mistakenly ordered this cable when I ordered my new DVD player. I already had a cable to connect the player up to the HDTV, and tried to cancel the order within minutes (less than 5 minutes) after the order was placed. This was on a Saturday, and I didn&rsquo;t receive any reply from the distributor, other than the normal Amazon notification that my cancellation order had been sent to the distributor. I didn&rsquo;t think too much of it, because being a weekend day, I thought their office might be closed until Monday, then I would hear from them. On Monday I did hear from them, it was a notification that the cancelled cable had been shipped that morning. I contacted the distributor by e-mail, because no phone number was available, and was notified in their reply, that they couldn&rsquo;t cancel the order at that point, because it had already been packaged for shipping. They were very adamant about that in subsequent e-mail conversations, and wouldn&rsquo;t work with me on resolving the issue.When I received it, I just decided to keep it, in the event I should need it for something else in the future. It was such a low cost item, less than $5.00, that I decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth the hassle of returning it. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what most people do, and what the company is betting will happen.</p>

<h5 id="not-all-hdmi-cables-are-the-same">Not all HDMI cables are the same!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Now judging by my topic, I&rsquo;m not telling you to go spend $25 dollars and HDMI cables.Especially not MONSTER CABLES for $50-$250.All I&rsquo;m saying is there are differences versions of HDMI, and they all should be able to deliver 1080P signal, and some should be able to go even further with deep color, Ethernet, higher resolutions than 1080p and so on. These cables combine all of them, and I actually noticed a better picture quality from the LAST brand of cheap HDMI cables I brought on Amazon.com.These seem to handle motion better (could it be that they handle 10.2GB instead of 2.5Gbs?) they also seem to have a richer color and the colors pop from the screen. Now I&rsquo;m not saying that the last HDMI cable was bad or anything, they both look amazing, especially if you have people over watching a movie or event. However these just look a tad bit better.If you have some older versions of HDMI you might wanna think about replacing. I am now removing all of my OLD HDMI cabling in my entertainment system, consoles, HTIB, and etc, and replacing my old ones from Eforcity (a great shipper) with these.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-bargain-for-a-needed-item">A Great Bargain For A Needed Item</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For awhile I&rsquo;ve been playing my Xbox 360 on a standard component t.v. but now able to afford a LCD t.v. my dilemma now became getting a HDMI cable for my Xbox 360 along with my PS3 that I had bought, and like a lot of consumers I first went to some electronic stores but after seeing the outrageous prices for a simple 3ft to 6ft cable that they wanted to sell for $50.00 dollars I decided to try out the reliable Amazon website. Now that I have the cables I&rsquo;m very happy to have made this desicion to get these instead of paying an elaborate amount at a store for the same item, the hooking up was of course very easy as was the menu options to reselect the video settings for my game consoles and after seeing the difference all I can say is Wow. The video is of course is sharper more detailed and looks more superior than what I was seeing before not to much of a difference but instead of some of the subtitles or letters looking scrunched together like before this time vastly more easier to read as well as see. Also I can&rsquo;t really say if anyone else has heard the difference but the sound quality of my Xbox 360 when I play games is vastly improved as well which is a true joy for me as well. So if you&rsquo;re like me and just bought a new LCD or Plasma t.v. and now are on the look out for some HDMI cables than I say look no farther here&rsquo;s a great choice and at a very reasonable price too&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="excellent-product-inexpensive-and-functions-exactly-as-it-should">Excellent product&ndash;inexpensive and functions exactly as it should</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly many folks have been pushed or conned by salespeople to purchase outrageously expensive &ldquo;high-speed&rdquo; HDMI cables that offer zero functional advantage over these far less expensive ones &hellip;Go ahead and enjoy the snob-appeal of your $35 (or more) 6-ft. HDMI cable. Of course you&rsquo;ll need to boast of how much they cost you as you adjust your recliner and click your remote.Moi? I&rsquo;ll be relaxing too, secure in the knowledge I have the exact-same-quality signal going to my HDTV as you, except I&rsquo;ll still have the $30 you wasted on your ###ster brand cable.</p>
