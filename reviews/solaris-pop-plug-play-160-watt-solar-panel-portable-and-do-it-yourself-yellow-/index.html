<p>Color:Yellow
Solaris POP is a mini solar power, renewable energy photovoltaic module suitable for residential areas, rented and owned houses, and for any other on grid purpose. It is at the forefront of portable solar panel, solar power and small renewable energy solutions. Solaris POP is manufactured by RenFactory, a resourceful, established Italian renewable energy and solar power company. The modules are imported and sold into the United States by Green Book Project. As a result, Solaris Pop benefits from high-tech European renewable energy R&amp;D and stunning Italian design, while being safely usable in America. Solaris POP is available in 4 different, bright colors: red, blue, yellow and green. The generator has a rated power of 160 W, while the PV surface is only 1m2. This allows to reset the basic energy consumption of a medium size house, when the house is idle. POP is already assembled, and it just needs to be taken out of the box. It can be connected in less than 1 minute, just by plugging the generator’s plug into any electrical house socket. This renewable energy, solar power mini generator can be disconnected at any time and transported anywhere. As a renewable energy and solar power photovoltaic module, Solaris POP allows the owner to request a 30% Federal Solar Tax Credit. As a result, 30% of the purchasing price of the item can be deducted from your federal tax bill when purchasing this solar power device! POP can be connected directly to the house. It introduces usable renewable energy and solar power into the household electrical system, in order to absorb the fixed daytime consumption of an idle medium-sized house. The mini generator is connected to the household electrical system thanks to a simple plug, and it can be easily disconnected at any time. POP converts the sun’s energy into electrical power, making it immediately usable into your house. Thanks to its innovative design, POP is 100% safe, and it is easily transportable.</p>

<h5 id="works-very-well-but-some-temperature-sensitivity">Works very well - but some temperature sensitivity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 5 of these Solaris panels to place on our flat garage roof - it gets sunlight most of the day. We had considered getting a commercial solar panel installation, but we have a shake roof on the house that we&rsquo;d have to replace, first. These seemed like a good option that would help us avoid the high usage surcharge ($0.40/kW.hr) our power company imposes if we exceed 1200 kW.hr/month.I&rsquo;d highly recommend getting a KMC Wifi Smart Plug ($16) so you can monitor how much power the panel(s) are producing using your smart phone. Lying almost flat on the roof the five panels peak out at about 600W around noon, and usually produce 4 kW.Hr each day.They work very well - but they are temperature sensitive. Their rated operating range is up to 65C (149F), but during a recent hot spell (103F air temperature) they virtually shut off during the hottest part of the day (12-2PM). Perhaps the temperature on the roof in direct sunlight exceeded their limit - but they started producing power again later in the afternoon. I&rsquo;ve noticed that they produce the most power on cooler, sunny days.They seem well constructed, and I love the fact that I can just plug them into a normal house socket and they work!</p>

<h5 id="a-good-start-could-improve-in-some-respects">A good start, could improve in some respects</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First one came broken (photovoltaic glass was shattered)&ndash;had to get rid of it. Thankfully a refund was granted without having to return it (since it was a hazard).Second one came, similarly packaged but thankfully intact.The metal stand that comes with it is a little puzzling to assemble&ndash;could definitely use better pictures.Bought a KMC Smart Plug as suggested, did some testing. It indeed gives around 150-160W on a sunny day with optimal angling.Do not use indoors or have any part of the panel shaded (even just a small part)&ndash;any shading will decrease the amount of power by 10 fold.Handle by the sides when lifting&ndash;do not try to lift with the top margin since the rubber lining is only held to the panel with glue (which can come off with heat).Use this on a deck or a flat roof that only you have access to&ndash;it&rsquo;s REALLY portable which means it&rsquo;s going to walk if you put it on a patio that&rsquo;s accessible to others.</p>

<h5 id="would-recommend-good-product">Would recommend, good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very simple set up, came quickly and had no issues. I bought a wattage reader to track production, and in Michigan I average about 0.75 kWh per day in July after tracking for about 10 days. The only real complaint I have is that I&rsquo;ve never seen more than 115 watts of production at any given time, but given less than ideal angles this is to be expected. Overall would recommend, the 30% federal tax credit essentially makes this cost $280!</p>

<h5 id="my-panel-has-also-disgorged-an-amazing-amount-of-this-wax">My panel has also disgorged an amazing amount of [this] wax</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>See my reply to another customer, where I wrote: My panel has also disgorged an amazing amount of [this] wax. VERY glad to hear that&rsquo;s what it is, and not something more toxic.I have another brand of plug &amp; play panels, and though they do reduce their power output when it&rsquo;s hot, it&rsquo;s not by nearly so much as this unit. The heat performance of this unit is just unacceptable. It goes to ZERO output on a hot day for several hours, and even when the temperature cools a bit, it is still only producing a fraction of what it produces in the initial couple of hours of sunlight.The edge trim is glued on with some sort of adhesive that is also sensitive to heat. My panel has basically had the entire edge trim come unglued.The power output I&rsquo;ve been seeing, using a KillAwatt meter, is about 100 watts until 10 AM, then the unit starts lessening its power output, and it will go to zero during the peak sunlight hours from about 11:30 AM until about 2 PM. I&rsquo;m not giving the unit a 1-star rating as it still produces some power as the day cools, but this unit seems unsuited for ambient temperatures above 85 degrees F.</p>

<h5 id="i-ll-spring-for-the-more-expensive-next-time">I&rsquo;ll spring for the more expensive next time.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While I like that its a solar panel, plug and play and generates a lot of power, I don&rsquo;t like how my mount is missing pieces and I never recieved any assembly instructions. While the mount might be easy enough to figure out, it still needs all of it pieces! I will not buy this brand again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>comes with stand and angles are 35/45/55 degrees..top watts 114 in minnesota</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-is-this-yellow-liquid-dripping-from-the-inverter-got-it-on-my-hand">What is this yellow liquid dripping from the inverter? Got it on my hand.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Something went wrong with mine. I was producing only 45 watts then I noticed a yellow goo dripping from the inverter. When I unplugged it to move it out of the sun a large amount of liquid poured out of the inverter. Some got on my hand, spilled on my deck. I wrote a letter to Green, waiting for a response. Is this stuff toxic????Hopefully I hear back very soon.Update: They said it is candle wax, nothing to worry about, it is used as a coolant. I was offered a replacement for free, I declined since it powers down when exposed to the heat of direct sunlight and leaks candle wax which fills the plastic inverter housing mounted directly on the back of a black glass solar array.I hope they sell billions of these and have years of great relations with their customers.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-i-have-2-solar-panels-i-bought">so far I have 2 solar panels. i bought &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>so far I have 2 solar panels. i bought 2, last month they saved me a 100 wattson my electric bill.Loving it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-product-not-so-much-the-pricing-strategies">Love the product, not so much the pricing strategies!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this panel in excellent condition and within 15 mins had it up and running. Very simple to install, and it looks great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cute-and-easy-to-set-up">Cute and easy to set up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is so easy to set up. Just but the base together (no screws)&hellip;&hellip;so easy and cute. Truly plug and play.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solaris-pop-is-the-best-deal-you-can-do">Solaris POP is the best deal you can do!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solaris POP is an amazing product, it&rsquo;s cheap compared to other solar pops, the product is much better and the design is really awesome!</p>
