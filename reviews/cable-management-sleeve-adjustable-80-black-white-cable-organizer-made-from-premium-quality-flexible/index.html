<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-s-pretty-versatile-and-flexible-and-i-like-that-it-was">It&rsquo;s pretty versatile and flexible and I like that it was &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The initial purpose I had for this product was to use the white side and run cables from a freshly mounted tv down the side of my fireplace. However the white, understandably so, is not quite the same as my mantle. So I decided to use the black side (amazing it&rsquo;s reversible) and cut it down to work with the cable mess. I have plans to actually clip it to the shelving we have to hide it more. It&rsquo;s pretty versatile and flexible and I like that it was easy to cut down to the proper sizes.</p>

<h5 id="no-more-messy-cables">No More Messy Cables!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cable Management Sleeve | Adjustable 80&rdquo; Black &amp; White Cable Organizer Made From Premium Quality Flexible Neoprene | Baltic Living® Cord OrganizerI got this product two (2) days after purchasing it online. This cable management sleeve from Baltic Living is exactly what I needed to organize the cables of our musical instruments in our living room and the electronic wires under my computer table. It&rsquo;s very hard to move and work if you have messy wirings everywhere. I cut the sleeves into four and used it to organized my messy cables in the bedroom and living room. Now my cables are no longer all over the place.This sleeve is very convenient and easy to use. It could be inverted and used either side. I prefer having the black outside so that it won&rsquo;t easily get dirty. And, you can actually reuse it, just undo the Velcro of the sleeve.Overall, I am pleased with this product. I gave this a five (5) star because it well-made, reusable and you can fit a lot of wires through the sleeves because it is made from highly durable &amp; flexible neoprene.I&rsquo;d highly recommend this.NOTE: I received this product at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased opinion. I am under no obligation to leave a positive review if my experience is otherwise.</p>

<h5 id="the-reversible-idea-is-cool-but-not-very-practical-unless-you-have-bright">The reversible idea is cool, but not very practical unless you have bright</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much more roomy than I expected. The reversible idea is cool, but not very practical unless you have bright, stark white walls. For some reason, the black side looks better in my opinion. Very easy to cut to desired length, cut holes in, etc. Neoprene seems to be decent quality and I&rsquo;d expect it to last forever in my application which is just sitting there holding cables that I never really mess with after setup. No complaints, nothing fancy, just does exactly what it advertises.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-concept-could-use-some-improvements">Great concept, could use some improvements</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept is great! You can cut it to size, you can put a lot of cables in at once, and you can let isolated cables escape the sleeve earlier if needed. Super helpful!Less good is that the &ldquo;white&rdquo; side is more of a gray, and that you need to find a way to hide the velcro part because it&rsquo;s black, and therefore has a lot of contrast when you use the white side. It is not easy to hide that part from all angles, it might be less of an issue if the whole sleeve just came in white, including the velcro part. In one case, about 2 inches of the velcro detached from the neoprene after cutting. That&rsquo;s not a big deal since this part is hidden behind furniture/electronics anyway, and the rest of the velcro holds it in place.I ordered two of these, and one had a few creases from being folded, it seemed.Conclusion: Does the job! Could use some small improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-innovative-and-useful">Very Innovative and Useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is amazing. I was a bit skeptical when I ordered but it arrives in a roll, one side black and one side white. We used the white primarily to conceal several large cables coming from a big screen TV and assorted peripherals. It was very isse to apply, simply measure the length needed cut and secure in place with the provided velcro edging. I could not be happier with the innovative approach the manufacturer used to the unsightly spaghetti of cables and wires.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-happy-with-this-product">Really happy with this product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had some cables out in the open I wanted to conceal better and keep my cat from messing with. This sleeve did just the trick! The sleeve is reversible black or white. It has Velcro along the edges to easily wrap around your cables. It&rsquo;s also extremely easy to cut the product into the length you need for an area. Overall it has helped me declutter one area that was constantly visible and which looked untidy. I think my cables look a lot better managed now. This isn&rsquo;t a perfect way to conceal your cables but a cheap and easy method. This also helps if you have pets that get into cables and want to keep them from messing with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-great-for-my-application">Worked Great for my application.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Cable Management Sleeves worked great for me. Wrapping the cables with it was very easy and made the cable mess going across one wall of my office look much better. People hardly even notice them now. One sleeve was not long enough for my needs so I purchased 2. I put the first one on starting from one end and then overlapped the 2nd sleeve on the first sleeve by about 2 inches. You can hardly tell it&rsquo;s not just one long sleeve. It was plenty big for the 4 cables I needed to hide.</p>

<h5 id="awesom">awesom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome product! one side is black, the other is white&hellip;. two for the price of one! it wraps around in such a way it will hold both larger cables and smaller as well&hellip; i love the adjustability of it. it can be cut to any length. so i can clean up cables behind the monitors as well as the cables to the outlets on the wall. in my humble opinion, this is well worth the cost. judith</p>
