<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price and service this works great. It has a ton of features and a load of power. Quality,power,nice. Charge LED light on top. LED light to see the job. Comes with bits. Not heavy and does the job. Great balance. The chuck has no wobble. You could pay more for a Bosch or DeWalt but the only thing you get is the name. It comes with a nice set of bits. We used this around the house to install security cameras,blinds,etc. The chuck is nice and it<code>s a cinch to change bits and it grips them tight. As for how long the battery holds a charge it depends on how often you use it and how hard the material is you drill into. Update! It</code>s 3/27/16. Still going strong. Get the 12v if you need extra kick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="definitely-worth-the-money">Definitely worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased on older home and have been in the process of updating all the lighting fixtures ( I have quite a few) and bought this to help speed things up. I reach for this more than my cordless drill since it size and weight make it easy to carry around. I have used mine pretty regularly for 6 months and it is holding up well. It has good battery life and enough power for most small jobs. This is in no way a substitute for a regular drill but it is a good addition to any toolbox.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy-for-the-money">Good buy for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t expect too much for the price. Not a lot of torque but just enough to do what I needed it to do (remove tag bolts off of cars). The light in the front is very helpful and battery holds a charge for a long time and indicator light seems to work fine. Overall not bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lighter-than-advertised">Lighter than advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have only had mine for a couple of hours but wow am I impressed. I bought it because my job has turned me into a laptop repairman and I am turning screws all day. I started looking at 4 volt screwdrivers that only weighed 1 pound but I was worried that they would lose their charge too quickly so I was glad to find this 7.2 volt driver that was about the same size. The description says it weighs 2.2 pounds which I figured I could live with since I needed it to last all day, but I was pleasantly surprised to look in the manual and find they had it listed as 1 pound. I put it on a food scale and it weighs 1 pound 1 <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> ounces. I know it is not designed for heavy duty work but I was hoping it would be strong enough for occasional medium duty jobs so I charged it up and proceeded to repair some slats that had fallen off of the fence. I ran about 20 1 ¼ course thread screws through ¾ inch slats with no pilot holes and it had just enough power to sink them flush. The charge indicator was still green when I finished so I am pretty confident it will run laptop screws for quite a while before needing a charge. The manual says charge time is 3 to 5 hours.</p>

<h5 id="good-alternative-to-a-toy-drill-for-mature-kids-wanting-to-be-like-daddy">Good alternative to a toy drill for mature kids wanting to be like daddy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 4 year old son&rsquo;s toy drill broke and he discovered my &ldquo;real&rdquo; cordless drills but they were too heavy for him. I was looking at toy drills again and thought of something like this, a low rpm cordless screwdriver.Keep in mind the maturity of your child and that they will obviously need a lot of supervision using REAL tools. That said, my son LOVES this thing! He uses it when he&rsquo;s with me in my workshop. It is great for him because it is low RPM, has a torque limiting clutch, and isn&rsquo;t too heavy. He has a thick pine board and a handful of 1&rdquo; Phillips head screws and has fun just driving them in then reversing the drill to take them back out. Though he almost always uses it until the battery is dead, the battery life is good. He&rsquo;s even dropped it (fell off his workbench) from about 30&rdquo; onto the concrete floor a couple times and it still works.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-torque-adjustment">Get torque adjustment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking at my Amazon orders and just realized it has been almost a year since I bought this drill driver, so it is about time I say that I love it! I bought it specifically for driving Kreg screws because it has the torque adjustment. It is very easy to strip Kreg screws in soft wood because you cant&rsquo;t see the head of the screw inside the pocket and you have to depend on the torque setting to know when to stop. The setting is sensitive and consistent; changing just one number make a difference. Now I find myself using the tool all the time so I will wear it out. Going to order another one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-at-this-price">Good value at this price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my lightweight jobs, because it is not bulky and heavy. therefore, I can fit it in just about any of my pockets. Not much of difference between the two speeds, but that&rsquo;s not a big deal.I am giving it 4 stars, because you are really getting a good value for this price (just under $30 in 2016). I didn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars, because I believe the positioning of the LED light could have been better (or even had a second one), and because the torque settings are not very good, meaning the first 14 settings seem to be for very light screwing, but as soon as you set it to 15 you can do pretty heavy jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="chuck-wobbling-badly-unusable">Chuck wobbling badly - unusable!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I returned the first one for the same reason. Ordered again thinking it might have been just bad luck &hellip; it&rsquo;s much worse! The first one can at least drive screws okay. The main reason for me to choose this model is that occasionally I need to drill holes for screws. This model has very convenient features for swapping drill bits and screw drive heads quickly and securely, having relatively higher power and still being compact. I feel so sorry having to return it twice. It could become the best selling drill/driver if the manufacturer can make the chuck go straight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little drill.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to be cheaply made lacking in power. I realize it isn&rsquo;t made for heavy duty work, but the difference between a similar Skil model I had for years and this one are profound.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good, but not great. As it cannot drill cement walls.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine">Works fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it around the house and works fine for my small projects. I recommend it for your small DIY light use projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-pretty-well-clutch-seems-to-kick-in-the-same">Works pretty well. Clutch seems to kick In the same &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works pretty well. Clutch seems to kick In the same no matter the setting. Works for basic stuff though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="crap">crap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this driver is an absolute piece of junk! The very first time I used it, it striped out the gears inside it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-complain">Can&rsquo;t complain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t complain so far for the price it gets the job done small tasks of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-waste-of-money">What a waste of money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have enough power to hardly do anything I bought it for. What a waste of money!</p>
