<p>Standard Speed vs
Hi-Speed Flash Memory</p>

<p>Where fast just got faster…
PNY&rsquo;s new line of Elite Performance SDXC flash memory cards are the perfect solution for photographers and videographers utilizing advanced DSLR cameras, and HD camcorders. With speed performance up to 60MB/s, you&rsquo;ll be ready to capture ultra-fast action shots and HD video without missing a beat. These cards and are built with UHS-1 (Ultra High Speed) bus interfaces for getting the optimal performance out of your camera/camcorder.</p>

<p>Experience High Speed Capture of HD and 3D Video with Class 10 UHS-1 Performance
PNY&rsquo;s Elite Performance SDXC UHS-I Memory Card is ideal for recording high-quality HD videos with a camcorder or your DSLR. The card&rsquo;s Class 10 UHS-1 rating means it can keep up with the demands of capturing HD footage. Its U1 speed class (UHS Speed Class 1) means it can capture real-time video and large-size HD videos with UHS-1-enabled host devices.</p>

<p>Speedy File Transfer and High Capacity Storage
Additionally, you&rsquo;ll appreciate the transfer speeds of up to 60MB/s that will minimize the amount of time you&rsquo;ll spend waiting for videos to transfer to your computer for back-up and editing. Altogether making your workflow much more efficient and speeding up your file offloads. And with 64GB of storage you&rsquo;ll be able to capture thousands of images and hours of HD video.</p>

<p>What does 60MB/s speed performance and UHS-1 mean for me?
You don&rsquo;t need to be a professional photographer to utilize a Class 10 UHS-1 card, and the increased 60MB/s read speeds make a difference. Whether you&rsquo;re taking family photos or shooting action sports, PNY&rsquo;s Elite Performance 60MB/s cards are ideal for situations where capturing every moment counts.</p>

<p>60MB/s speeds you to capture more high quality photos faster and more accurately, saving you time and aggravation
Shoot HD video effectively
Which Class Rating is left for me?
The SD Association has created and defined 4 speed classes to help you identify speed and guaranteed performance capabilities/minimum requirements of SD/SDHC/SDXC cards and their host products. Please note that UHS-1 is also defined as a Class 10 card, but has speed performance higher than 10MB/s.</p>

<h5 id="card-failure-after-3-months-lifetime-warranty-does-not-mean-lifetime-warranty">Card Failure After 3 Months - &ldquo;Lifetime Warranty&rdquo; Does Not Mean &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; Warranty!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do a lot of video production&hellip; It demands reliable, high quality equipment. For years I have used SANDisk products and have never had an issue. Recently I went with PNY because of the transfer speed and supposed ruggedness etc. My cards are not put through rough conditions&hellip; In fact, the cards are always in one of three places: Stored in a Pelican SD case, In the cameras, In a reader for transfers. For applications such as weddings, there simply is not an option to retake shots because of failures, which is a reason I run a backup solid state device on the cameras as well. After switching to the PNY product, I finally had a chance to restore data from the SSL device due to the failure of this SD card. The card cannot be seen or mounted from any device and that data is now lost. This brand will not be on my approved vendor list starting now. I would like the product replaced however&hellip; after all&hellip; I paid for it. An email to PNY about this issue was replied to with the quoted text below. The links only take you to the legal writings of the products. For warranty items, there is a link on those pages that directs you to PNY.Com. Not too useful. Keep in mind that PNY advertises a &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; warranty for this product - What this means is that it is only good for the time in which the device is being sold. Once the product goes off the shelf, so does your warranty. The other PNY SD cards that I had purchased are still working, but I am never again going to use them for a production application. I hope this review helps someone who is considering this product.&ldquo;Thank you for contacting PNY Technical Support.First I need to inform you that PNY does not perform data recovery nor has the software to do so. What I can suggest is to do a websearch for data recovery software or services.As for the warranty:Standard size cards – Lifetime, Details are at the link belowhttp://www.pny.com/File%20Library/Support/PNY%20Products/Warranties/Flash%20Memory%20Cards/Flash-Media-2-21-13_v1.pdfMicroSD cards – 1 Year, Details are at the link belowhttp://www.pny.com/File%20Library/Support/PNY%20Products/Warranties/Flash%20Memory%20Cards/Micro-SD-Warranty-2-21-13_v1.pdfRegards,JanTechnical Support&rdquo;READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="read-this-before-buying-any-memory-card-over-32gb">READ THIS BEFORE BUYING ANY MEMORY CARD OVER 32GB!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>READ THIS BEFORE BUYING ANY MEMORY CARD OVER 32GB!!!Good to keep in mind when buying a memory card for phone or computer:Newer sd/micro sd memory cards that are bigger than 32gb DO NOT run on the traditional memory system of FAT32 which many devices (like windows and blackberry) mostly used until the year 2012.Rather these bigger sized cards run on an upgraded system called exFAT which many devices do not recognize yet.So if you buy a micro sd card for your bb/iphone/galaxy/etc. Make sure that if the memory card is over 32gb, that your device can handle it (see following link). Otherwise just stick with 32gb card or lower. For use on a computer (windows/Mac), you can upgrade the computer software to run exfat and then use the card on your computer.All explained simply and in short over here of how to tell what works with which memory cards:[&hellip;]Click here for a link to update your windows 7/vista/xp or Mac software to recognize exFat:[&hellip;]You can also just convert the card from exFat to Fat32 using the &ldquo;SmartDisk Fat32 format utility&rdquo; could help.This info could/will save you lots of trouble.[&hellip;]Have a wonderful day :)READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This memory card is part of the new line of memory cards aimed at the serious professional, hobbyist or tech enthusiast.The card is made in Japan. Lifetime Limited Warranty in the USA.I use a Transcend USB 3.0 Super Speed Multi-Card Reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC/MS/CF Cards (TS-RDF8K) that is connected to my USB 3.0 slot for a Read/Write test.Also, testing with a IOGEAR USB 2.0 Hub and 45-in-1 Card Reader GUH287 (Black) for USB 2.0 slot Read/Write test.I used a program that writes a 500MB file 5 times and averages the resultsPNY Elite Performance 90 MB/s (32GB card)USB 3.0Read 96.75 MB/sWrite 63. MB/sUSB 2.0Read 20.04 MB/sWrite 19.49 MB/sSandisk Extreme 45 MB/s (32GB card)USB 3.0Read 44.48 MB/sWrite 42.15 MB/sUSB 2.0Read 20.10 MB/sWrite 19.50 MB/sSandisk ExtremePRO 95 MB/s (32GB card)(coming soon, currently lent out).The Sandisk Extreme is still an UHS-1 Card and I just wanted to include it until my extreme pro is back in my hands.The key thing about the speed (transfer rate from memory card to computer) is that you really need USB 3.0 in order to see those fast transfer speed numbers. As for electronic devices, if the devices are UHS-1 compatible you should be able to see the benefits. In some cases like DSLRs, the write to card is limited by the buffer or the memory slot unit. Be back in a few months, testing it to see if it can handle photography gigs with my D600.READ MORE</p>
