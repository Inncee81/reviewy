Select a personalized setting between 10 to 90 PSI with 1,400 pulses per minute to keep your gums healthy. The Ultra Water Flosser cleans deep between teeth and below the gumline, while massaging and stimulating the gums.

<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-quiet-operation-large-water-reservoir-variety-of-tips">Very happy with this. Quiet operation, large water reservoir, variety of tips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: 1/24/2014 - Waterpik has a new model, the Aquarius Model WP660C, Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser, White Satin Base with Crystal Clear Reservoir. It&rsquo;s been updated with a few new features. It has a gum massage feature and to help you pace your flossing it pulses at 30 and 60 seconds. It runs for 90 seconds on a full tank at the highest pressure setting. The WP-100W has a clunky storage space on the top for storing the tips and the WP-660C does away with that while allowing the storage of two tips between the reservoir and body of the waterpik. It is much lighter in weight (not sure if that&rsquo;s good or not) and is attractive in a waterpik kind of way. You may want to consider checking out my review of the WP-660C before making your decision on which to get. I actually prefer this Ultra WP-100W in spite of the new features of the Aquarius WP-660C&mdash;I&rsquo;m very pleased with this Waterpik Ultra WP-100W water flosser. Prior to this I owned an Interplak Dental Water Jet, 1 each and I was quite happy with how long it lasted. That one lasted 3 years with daily use and started to leak at the handle so I decided it was time to buy a new one. Unable to locate the same thing locally, I decided to purchase the Waterpik WP-100 and so far I find it superior to the Interplak.The Waterpik operates on 120V, 60Hz only.Measures at the base 5.5&rdquo; wide, 4.75&rdquo; deep.Cord length is about 54&rdquo; which is quite generous.It&rsquo;s got a small footprint so doesn&rsquo;t take up much counter space. The Interplak didn&rsquo;t take up much space either, but the Interplak was very light and it was more difficult to remove the water reservoir than with the Waterpik. The Waterpik is heftier and feels more substantial and better built.I was also quite surprised at how quiet it is. Compared to the Interplak which made a LOT of noise, this is very quiet.I think the water reservoir has more than enough capacity for me and I seldom fill it all the way to the top. Usually about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the way to get a thorough amount of flossing action. With the water reservoir filled completely and the pressure set to mid-range it will operate for 2 minutes 45 seconds.A large variety of tips are included, most of which I never use. But if you have orthodontic appliances, then there are tips that you will appreciate for getting around the orthodontics. there is only one standard tip however so if you are not the only person using the machine, you&rsquo;ll have to purchase some additional &ldquo;normal&rdquo; tips for other users.I have the pressure setting set to 7 and it&rsquo;s plenty powerful enough for me.The handle has a really handy button to temporarily stop the flow of water and I also really like the rotating tip feature that lets you easily manipulate the tip position while its in your mouth without having to do contortions with your hand and arm.It&rsquo;s a winner. Now I just hope it lasts for years. I&rsquo;ll update my review if necessary.UPDATE: August 12, 2012 - My WaterPik is now almost a year old and is still working perfectly. I use it every day. No leaks, no odd noises. It&rsquo;s doing its job well.UPDATE: May 19, 2013 - Still going strong. No problems.UPDATE: January 24, 2014 - Still going strong. No problems.</p>

<h5 id="great-waterpik-for-home-use">Great waterpik for home use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For near-dental quality ‘water-flossing’ I would say the Water Flosser (from Waterpik) is as good as you can get in an ‘at-home’ model. While there are many things about it that could be better (the plastic has a cheap feeling to it, the product itself is very light-weight) the improvements would likely raise the cost of this product by hundreds of dollars. For the price, this is as good as it gets.While I have been really working hard to ‘beautify’ my smile for an upcoming wedding, I use the Waterpik as part of a healthy regimen of cleaning my teeth. It has 8 different attachments, but you really only need to use the 3 standard jets and the 1 attachment for deep gum cleaning. I’ve been using This teeth dental-strength whitening kit for the past few weeks in preparation for the wedding, and because of this, I was worried that my gums would be a bit sensitive if flossed too much. Luckily this unit has 7 different speeds, so regardless of whether or not you floss or if you’re trying to use different cosmetic whitening solutions this product will still work well. I’m happy to say that using this has helped me not only keep my mouth free of periodontal disease but has enabled me to floss with water while using the whitening product. My gums are still healthy as can be and my teeth are white as ever.The one complaint I do have about this product is the hose is quite short. This means you have to have the product very close to the sink in order to use it. I would make sure to have an extension cord handy so this product doesn’t end up being a cumbersome task of plugging and un-plugging whenever you want to use it.Asides from that, I really have no complaints about this. I’m giving it a 5 out of 5 stars. The people who give it a lower grade fail to remember the value they’re getting for their buck. I always look at the value for the product in comparison to the results, and am happy with this purchase decision.</p>

<h5 id="mold-warning">Mold Warning!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We actually have liked this product and used it for more than two years. However, recently when changing the tip I noticed black particles coming out of the hand-held wand bulb. I then hit this plastic section against the sink and dislodged a considerable amount of additional black material. I felt it was then important to break open this plastic bulb section - the part you hold in your hand - and found it full of black colored mold! In my opinion this is a serious design flaw. Since this section is not sealed, it should be possible to clean it. Yet, in the Waterpik manual, you will find no instructions on how to do this, or that it is even necessary. I have read one third-party article that recommends periodic soaking of this plastic bulb in vinegar. However, there is no a way to assure that it is clean, without breaking it. It does appear that any mold in the plastic case of the hand unit may not contaminate the water spray into the mouth, however, the proximity of mold growth so close to mouth is, in my opinion, unacceptable.I called Waterpik to advise them of my concern, noting that, while we don&rsquo;t seem to be allergic to mold, many people are and this section of their device should 1) be re-manufactured to allow opening and cleaning and 2) cleaning procedures should be published in their manual. Obviously, we have discontinued using the Water Pik. To their credit, the company has responded by email and is, apparently, now looking into this matter. They have offered a replacement unit and we have declined.</p>
