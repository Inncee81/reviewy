<h5 id="perfect-solution-for-safely-using-your-cell-phone-in-a-car-with-no-damage-to-your-phone-or-vehicle-interior">Perfect Solution For Safely Using Your Cell Phone In A Car, With No Damage To Your Phone Or Vehicle Interior.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a good way to keep your cell phone readily accessible while driving? I used to keep my phone on the passenger seat (only works if you do not have a passenger), or in one of the dash or console compartments (phone slides around and sometimes out onto the floor). I had quickly realized that I needed a method for securely mounting my phone in the car. I have tried nearly all of the various mounting methods (suction cup, Velcro patches, weighted bean bags, magnetic, etc.). None were really satisfactory. The suction cup type sometimes dropped my cell phone, and left hard to remove marks on my windshield. The sticky glue of Velcro patches has damaged my dashboard. The weighted bean bags still slipped, and did not securely hold my phone. And, there are very few places on modern cars to use a magnetic mount.I believe I have finally found a solution! The TaoTronics Car Air Vent Phone Mount Holder (TT-SH015) fits all of my requirements for a phone holder. It mounts, and unmounts, quickly, easily, and securely to a dash air vent blade. It uses silicone rubber pads (does not damage any part of the car in any way). A two position lever (one positon for thin air vent blades, and the other position for thicker blades), makes this holder usable in just about any car air vent (horizontal fins or vertical). It holds the phone itself securely to the mount with grooved rubber pads, that ratchet and lock your phone as you push the holder arms together (works with or without phone cases, and causes no damage to either your phone or case). The ratchet holder releases the phone easily with the push of a button on the mount (using only one hand). The position of the phone is quickly adjustable to just about any angle or position (including vertical and horizontal). The mount then can be easily locked with the turn of a knob for tightening, and locking the position desired.So, how does the mount work in actual driving? Excellent! I really liked the position of the phone while using this mount. It placed the phone just to the right of the steering wheel (when using the center air vent), and in close proximity while driving (more easily accessible than any of my car&rsquo;s dash controls or audio system controls). An incoming call can be answered by a touch of the phone, and another touch to place the phone in speaker mode, allowing total hands-free operation after that. This allows quick, and easy, one hand operation of the phone, and minimal eye movement from the road (for much improved safety).I sometimes use my cell phone as a GPS locator (map), and for instructions in finding a location, and using Google Maps to monitor traffic. This TaoTronics mount puts the phone in an excellent position (close and under the windshield) for excellent reception of the GPS satellites signals. I have had trouble with GPS reception with my cell phone in other positions in the car, as the satellite signals are shielded by the car&rsquo;s metal parts. This unit puts the phone in the optimum position for good reception.The phone mount appears to be constructed of ABS plastic (strong), and the quality of construction is excellent (very sturdy). The finish is nice. The instructions say to place the mount, with the lever down, to the bottom air vent fin for the maximum stability. I purposely placed the mount with the lever up, and on air vent fins other than the bottom one, and all positions seemed to work equally well for me. I used the mount and phone in 3 different cars, and it worked very well in all (2011 Honda Accord, 2011 Honda CVC, and a 1997 Honda Civic). I used the mount with an iPhone 5s, an iPhone 6, and a Samsung Galaxy S5, all with cases, and without. All were held securely in the mount. The mount is stated to hold phones with a width from 1.97&rdquo; to 3.70&rdquo;. I will definitely be using this phone mount, and purchasing another. I have not found a better way to use a phone in the car.Although I received the TaoTronics Car Air Vent Phone Mount Holder (TT-SH015) in exchange for a fair and honest evaluation, I feel that I have done an honest evaluation of the product. I did not receive any money or anything else for this evaluation.</p>

<h5 id="works-perfect-so-far">Works perfect so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed it today in my car&rsquo;s AC vent. Works perfect so far, button on the back of the ratcheting expandable phone clasp is slightly hard to access, not a show stopper. A button on the back of the ratcheting phone clasp mechanism releases tension &amp; activates tightness - makes it pretty easy to load and unload the phone. The vent clasp is tightened by a lever with two tension settings rather than a threaded tightener, easier to install and uninstall from the vent.My last purchase a 360 Degree AIKEMA (powder puff blue) with spring tension double metal bars phone clasp lasted 8 months, ahh, I really liked it and it is out of stock - this TaoTronics one looks like an equal match. I broke the blue padded plastic vent clasp on the AIKEMA changing out between my car and a rental, need to be more careful.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-good-car-mount">This is a very good car mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good car mount. I used it on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It holds the phone very well in a vertical or horizontal position. The Galaxy S7 Edge is a bigger heavier phone but did not seem to cause any problem while mounted to my BMW X5 heater vent. I like the fact that when you close the mounting arms against the phone that it gives it a nice positive click. It has a release button on the back that releases the phone and the arm kind of Pops open. The mounting arms that go into the event are pretty ingenious. It has a soft 1 position mode or a very tight position mode too. It works extremely well. No issues whatsoever especially going over hard bumps on a bad Road. I would recommend this to anybody.</p>

<h5 id="good-price-product-option">Good price / product option.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good price / product option.I have an Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) fits perfect.It becomes easy in the window of the vehicle, you should know well which option to adjust if the 1 or 2 to tighten in the window.It fits smoothly in the center windows in the 2015 Corolla.So far it has worked well.Cons: You must know how to put it so that the weight of the phone does not force it and lower the window.</p>

<h5 id="solid-universal-phone-clamp-air-vent">Solid universal phone clamp air vent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>YMMV, but no knock on the manufacturer tho. Product materials overall is a nice hard plastic and well build. There is two of three part I will explain with this product. The third part with the pivoting ball joint you know about it if you use car holder in the past with it.First the front clamp phone holder area. The teeth part is a semi-soft rubber material, it built-in not glue to clamp. A plus there. The button release seems durable from repeated use. The clamp holds the phone tightly when I use it with my LG G4. Any phone smaller than a Nexus 6 well not fit so measure your phone with body case if you have one on. Portrait mode with phone.The backside area vent grip fit my Prius with really thick vent guard well. It comes with a thick foam pad to protect and hold on your vent guard. I don&rsquo;t even have to use the I or II latch switch. But it holds pretty tight.Note if you have a heavy phone it will droop down, so place holder on a lowest or second lowest air vent fin. You can tilt some degree on the pivot ball joint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bent-up-easily">Bent up easily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed having this in my car but it didn&rsquo;t last. I constantly falls off which is so annoying. As you can see it&rsquo;s bent. Overall I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend. Had this for less than 6 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-customer-service">Excellent customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the ability to tighten it to the vent fins with a thumb switch. I have vertical fins in my car and it holds tight. It makes my phone easier to glance at maps without looking away from the road. The ball head joint helps get it in just the right position. The quick release is a nice feature as well as the unique finned rubber grippers for the phone, it really stays put pretty well. It is harder to dismount and mount phone compared to others. Thiercustomer service is always topsomething for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="button-easily-stuck">Button Easily Stuck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After using this for only a few days, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the release button tends to get stuck.When it does, the clamp cannot be closed until it is wiggled a bit to help loosen the button.Therefore, I consider either the unit I received to be defective or the product poorly designed.</p>

<h5 id="not-the-best-holder-but-does-the-job">not the best holder, but does the job</h5>

<p>very cheap, not the best holder, but does the job, most of the time.</p>

<p>Okay product, mostly does whats intended. Doesnt stay secure enough on vent and will fall off when going over bumps so i need to hold it.</p>

<p>Clip on part doesn&rsquo;t stay long. It just bent easily. I have had this for less than a month. But, the part &ldquo;clip on to vent&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t hold the vent and just slips down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="is-a-decent-phone-holder-but">Is a decent phone holder but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;it does not offer as strong of a grip on the vent as other similar holders I have used, even on its tightest setting - it has two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-durable-construction">Not durable construction</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After only a day or two the jaws of the clamping mechanism have stretched. The mount no longer holds securely to the vent slats.</p>

<h5 id="buy-it-but-wait">Buy it but wait.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. simple design. It fits in my acura tl 2005. I was surprised to see how sturdy it was after adjusting the clamps.</p>
