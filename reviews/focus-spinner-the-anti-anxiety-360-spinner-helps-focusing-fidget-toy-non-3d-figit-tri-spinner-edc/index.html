<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="spinning-into-focus">Spinning into focus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this product!! I originally bought it for my son who has autism, because I thought it would help him focus and still be able to fidget. He has a hard time sitting still for long periods of time and normally I don&rsquo;t mind this, but there are some instances where he just has to stay seated. This has helped with that. I received it just before finals week. After he went to bed that night, on a whim, I picked it up and started spinning it. To my surprise it helped me stay focused on studying. This is a great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-spinnner">good spinnner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the red spinner and the blue spinner. The blue spinner was shipped first. It is heavy, good quality, and spins great. Really happy with it. I got the red spinner today&hellip;.it&rsquo;s lighter weight, and the middle part fell off as soon as the spinner was dropped. However, I popped it back in, and it hasn&rsquo;t been an issue since. They both spin super fast for awhile. We all love playing with them. The heavier weighted blue one is better, but both good. Out of all the spinners out there, this product is the better out of the other brands. They raised the price so high on these though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fidget-toy">Great fidget toy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter saw one of these at school. She couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about it. We ordered one and she loves it. She keeps it with her at all times learning new spinning tricks. She also looked up youtube videos to find tricks. All of her friends now want them. Great toy, made well and really spins as seen on ads. For a child with ADHD who needs to always have something in her hands this is perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bought-2-1-is-great-other-arrived-damaged-barely-working">Bought 2 - 1 is great, other arrived damaged &amp; barely working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought two for my two kids. One arrived with problems - seems off centered or something. Makes a lot of noise, does not spin smoothly. The other one arrived working great. Very happy with one, not happy at all with the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="immediately-spun-it-and-loved-it-until-an-hour-later-when-he-dropped">immediately spun it and loved it. Until an hour later when he dropped &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son was so excited to get this! He spent his own money on it. He ripped it open, immediately spun it and loved it. Until an hour later when he dropped it&hellip;and it broke. Didn&rsquo;t even last a day. Very poor quality compared to the cheap one he bought off the playground at school that has survived a nuclear war. Save your money and buy a better quality spinner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-just-a-fad">Not just a FAD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received this yesterday for my son who is ADD and is in Special education. He also has high anxiety. He has kept it with him since it arrived. This one also glows green in dark and is almost a translucent White when not dark. Seems to spin forever. Sturdy. Not cheaply made. Or looks like t would be something for anyone out there.But&hellip; It is fairly hard material so if spinning fast keep away from any windows out breakables&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves his fidget spinner. Fast shipping. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pay-extra-and-get-the-real-one">Pay extra and get the real one.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t spin very long at all. Granddaughter has another from a different company that spins 3 times better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-glows">really glows</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>awesome glow in the dark fidget spinner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Son loves it and is still using it a few months after purchase. Has held up well and no issues. Quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-but-cheap-bearings">Ok, but cheap bearings</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bearings wear out quickly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="see-it-spin-in-the-dark">See it spin in the dark</h5>
