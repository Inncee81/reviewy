<p>Size:2 Pack of 25 Foot HDMI Cable
Twisted Veins High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet Package includes Two 25&rsquo; cables, a right angle / 90° adapter, and three 6&rdquo; resealable microfiber cable ties. All Twisted Veins cables conform to the latest 1.4 HDMI standard and support high speed, Ethernet, audio return, 1080P TVs, 3D TVs, Deep Color, TrueHD, and DTS-HD. Twisted Veins cables are premium cables with extra shielding, custom stronger connectors, gold plating, and a protective braided jacket. Twisted Veins cables are available in 3&rsquo;, 6&rsquo;, 10&rsquo;, 15&rsquo;, and 25&rsquo; lengths. Additionally, Twisted Veins offers a 6&rsquo; cable two pack, a receiver pack consisting of three 3&rsquo; cables and one 10&rsquo; cable, and three packs of right angle adapters. All of these are sold separately at Amazon and can be found by searching for Twisted Veins HDMI. This package includes one Twisted Veins right angle 90° connector, allowing components to have a lower profile for a more flush look and in cases when a straight cable connection is not ideal. Most TVs are designed to be used with either a 90° adapter but some use the alternative 270 degree adapter. Please check your TV for the orientation of the HDMI insert. Twisted Veins cables are triple tested for reliability. Nonetheless, should you ever experience a cable failure, please contact your authorized Amazon seller for immediate assistance.

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-buy-3-4-17-updated-from-4-to-5-stars">Good buy (3/4/17 Updated from 4 to 5 stars)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The HDMI elbow was backwards. Everything else is great.(Update)I&rsquo;m speechless. I left the review above less than a week ago. I came home from work and to my surprise I had a package. I didn&rsquo;t order anything. Twisted Veins must have a Customer Service team because they sent me a three pack of HDMI elbows adaptors that were in the correct direction. Best part is I have 3 monitors so it was perfect. That was seriously the best part of my day. Thank you for such great service.</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-brilliant-packaging-lots-of-extras-and-all-that-for-chump-change">Great quality, brilliant packaging, lots of extras, and all that for chump change.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>50 feet of high quality HDMI, very well packaged, even comes with a bunch of little extras, like a little light thingy to help you find that HDMI port in the dark corner, a cloth for wiping down computer and TV screens, and L connector for going around corners. And all this for a fraction of the cost of such a cable from competitors?! Yes please. This is a ridiculously good deal. If you need 50 ft of HDMI and you are looking at this on Amazon, just buy it already.Just note: The cable is very thick and pretty stiff. I got it around some corners just fine, but it is certainly a heavy duty cable, as a 50 footer should be.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-this-one-is-missing-the-angled-tips-but-i-didn-t-need-them-for-this-application">Perfect , this one is missing the angled tips but I didn&rsquo;t need them for this application</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought so many twisted veins brand HDMI cables because they are great. I bought way to many 6&rsquo; cables but now I have extras. These I bought for running behind the wall through tubes by the builder. I just didn&rsquo;t think I actually need a cable this long though. When it came to needing a additional cable for a DVR cable connection the cable that the builder had when we moved in to our new town home was the lowest basic so when the tip fell off of that one this weekend I immediately just ordered this one from Amazon . Amazon is the shopping solution to all your googling needs. I so love Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="stellar-performer-even-works-split-and-extended">Stellar Performer! Even works split and extended!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace a wireless HDMI setup that was too flaky. Wasn&rsquo;t too sure this cable could handle what I&rsquo;m doing especially at $39.99 but it performs perfectly! I tried it out in the open before running the cable between walls and was very happy to see it work.I&rsquo;m running this cable from my Dish VIP 722 satellite box to a ViewHD 1in/2out powered HDMI splitter through a conduit over 2 floors. I&rsquo;m able to avoid laying it near any electrical lines, or at most might have run perpendicular over one wire. From the splitter, I have a 3 or 6 foot HDMI cable to one TV, and a 25 foot HDMI cable to a surround sound receiver, and from the receiver to a TV with a 3 or 6 foot cable. I was afraid that would be asking too much. It isn&rsquo;t. All TVs work just fine, one at a time or any combination including all at the same time. That last TV shows input of 1080i which is the same as the VIP box puts out. The picture on all TVs look great so I believe it is 1080i. I have not tried 1080p so I won&rsquo;t make any claims on whether that will work.The cable itself is very substantial which helped it run easily through 2 conduits, one of which has two 90 degree bends. I had pre-run twine to help with the bended conduit but it actually worked better to push the cable through rather than pull it.Amazing price for a very solid product.</p>

<h5 id="missing-conductors-great-customer-service">Missing conductors, great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Missing 5 conductors. I ordered 2 cables to feed 2 identical Samsung smart TV&rsquo;s from a 1x4 splitter. Worked ok for 6 months. I could see a little sparkle on one display, which indicates a low signal. Then the intermittent problems began. I ordered a hdmi cable checker, to my surprise these were the worst cables out of a dozen. Missing connectivity on pins 2, 5, 8, 11 and 17. Mostly shields for the tmds and clock but 17 is a ground reference for several signals! I checked both cables, they were the same. The product description basically says anything over 720p probably won&rsquo;t work, 5-10 years ago this may have been acceptable.Feb 2017 update. Twisted Veins reached out and refunded my purchase and sent me a new 50ft cable. I tested it, same problem. I purchased verified HDMI 1.4 4K 35ft cables, working good now, I didn&rsquo;t need the extra 15ft, it was likely an issue with Hdmi 1.3a (1080p) the spec is only good up to 45ft. Im not saying wiith the right amplifier this cable may work, but I&rsquo;d rather run a cat6 with extenders or SDI on a coax.Feb 7th 2017 Update. I added three stars for the excellent customer service! They did everything they could to make it right. It&rsquo;s a rare quality in companies these days. I&rsquo;ll still use there products, because I know they will stand behind them.</p>

<h5 id="nice-product-unexpectedly-good-customer-service">Nice Product. Unexpectedly Good Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I inadvertently wrote a review for this cable for the 50&rsquo; product. My opinion hasn&rsquo;t changed. I bought 100&rsquo; for my small studio business to upgrade my ability to provide closed circuit TV coverage for things like focus groups and conference/meeting overflow, etc. I was worried that my cameras might not be able to drive 100&rsquo;, but they can and do quite nicely.The cables are nicely constructed. They are a little stiff and large in diameter for my taste, but then, there&rsquo;s probably a trade-off between armored, braided construction and flexibility and size. So all-in-all, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a good compromise.I initially gave the product 4-star&rsquo;s because of the size and stiffness issue. But after receiving a phone call from Twisted Veins, I must upgrade to 5-stars for their customer service. I explained my case, and they offered to send me some 270¨ adapters and give me a discount. I gladly accepted the adapter offer, but objected to the discount. After all, I thought the price had been fair, and I did get as much or more than I paid for. The adapters came yesterday, priority mail. I don&rsquo;t know if a discount is coming, but if one does, I guess I won&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the mouth.I recommend this product, and I congratulate Twisted Veins for actually reading the reviews and being so concerned about their customers&rsquo; satisfactions.</p>
