<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The AmScope PS25 microscope slide set includes 25 prepared slides of a variety of specimens including plants, insects, and animal tissues used in basic biology education. The samples are preserved in cedar wood oil and sealed with a coverslip to preserve specimens and prevent contamination. Labeling on each slide identifies specimens. Slides are composed of optical glass for clear viewing and are 3 x 1 x 0.4 inches/75 x 25 x 1mm (H x W x D, where H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) The set comes in a fitted wooden case to prevent breakage and ease handling.</p>

<p>Slide specimens include coprimus mushroom (cross section), dense connective tissue (section), dog cardiac muscle (longitudinal section), dog esophagus (cross section), dog skeletal muscle (longitudinal section and cross section), dog stomach (section), honeybee worker leg-composite (whole mount), house bee mouth parts (whole mount), human blood (smear), hydra (longitudinal section), Hydrilla verticillata leaf (whole mount), Lilium anther (cross section), Lilium ovary (cross section), nymphaea of apustio stem (cross section), onion epidermis (whole mount), pig motor nerve (section mount), pine leaf (cross section), pine stem (cross section), pumpkin stem (cross section), rabbit spinal cord (cross section), rabbit testis (section), sunflower stem (cross section), Tilia stem (cross section), young root of broad bean (cross section), Zea stem (cross section).</p>

<p>Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.</p>

<p>United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="surprisingly-good-specimens">Surprisingly good specimens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good collection of slides and made an excellent gift to a young family member who is starting out with biology studies. The specimens are very well prepared and clear and the glass slides themselves have smooth edges so there is no danger of a sharp corner on a finger (I have my own battle scars from cheap slides).Just one negative: most of the slides needed a wipe-down right out of the box - apparently they were badly finger-smudged during preparation and not cleaned before packaging.Overall, it&rsquo;s a good set of surprising quality.At the date of this review the description doesn&rsquo;t list the specimens, here they are: pine leaf,coprimus mushroom set, sunflower stem, broad bean root, onion skin, tilia stem, pumpkin stem, lillium ovary, lillium anther, zea stem, aqustio nymphaea stem, hydrilla leaf, pine stem, dog esophagus, human blood, dog skeletal muscle, pig motor nerve, rabbit spinal cord, rabbit testis, dog cardiac muscle, connective tissue, honeybee mouth parts, honeybee leg, hydra, dog stomach section. Most of these are in cross section.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-slide-set">LOVE this slide set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE this slide set. Very well put together, my children(3, 5, 7, 9) have had no problems finding the object under a microscope.The set comes in a very nice wood box, with a label sheet, which you really only need if you want to keep them in that order in the box. Each individual slide is labeled with the object to be observed.Great price for a starting set. As a homeschooling family, we have used this set quite frequently already.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-slides">Great slides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a college professor and have used slides similar to these many times in anatomy and physiology lab. I got these for my son&rsquo;s 4th grade classroom and am pleased. The quality is just as good as the ones the university purchases. The slide box is wooden and the slides fit inside perfectly. None were broken during shipment. The quality of microscope used will make a big difference in what one can observe from the slides. One with a100x objective and immersion oil is preferred but a 40x objective will also work, just with a less magnified and detailed image.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-club-science-at-home">Perfect for Club Science at home!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These microscope slides are great for my 6 year old science obsessed son! They have the description on them and then list all of the items: some favorites are dog cardiac muscle, and rabbit spinal cord (things we could have never explored under the microscope at home without the help of these pre-made slides. The complete list of included slides is noted in the product description and was 100% accurate. I ended up writing numbers on the slides that corresponded to the key to help make sure we were putting them in the proper slots. We have a decent quality kid microscope and they worked well. I like using these pre-made slides rather than the limited number of slides we can create at home. This would be a great addition to any homeschool co-op or science lab. The case is unfinished wood with a little clasp that secures it. I would not recommend transporting them very much as some of the slides have nicks in the sides from bouncing around in the case because they are in there close and tight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-starter-kit">Great starter kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not know much about science or how good or bad these slides are, but I can tell you they are an excellent way to give as a complimentary gift with a microscope. My 8 year old was asking for a microscope for Christmas and I needed a kit to go with this one and based on the good reviews I bought this one. I love it comes in a case and I think the kit helped to learn what to expect when she is looking into a slide.The truth is that after a month looking at the slides, she no longer looks at them or touches them at all she lost interest and that is normal because she wants to see new stuff she has not seen. She now uses some clean slides that came with the microscope to put new things like hair strings, strawberry&rsquo;s, cilantro and anything new see can find. This kit is perfect as I said so they can learn what to expect when making their own slides, but don&rsquo;t expect them to be hooked on them forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="packed-in-a-sturdy-wooden-box-with-a-label-of-all-slides-included">Packed in a sturdy wooden box with a label of all slides included</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This box of slides is ideal for the aspiring biologist as well as any science hobbiest. Packed in a sturdy wooden box with a label of all slides included, they remain safe and organized. The mounting and cover slips of all my specimens were well prepared. The collection contains a nice cross section of both plant and animal tissue. Cell structure and optimal staining techniques clearly enhance the study potential of this slide series.</p>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Slides are poorly mounted case is nice</p>

<h5 id="must-have-with-microscope">Must have with microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to go with a microscope I bought for my 8 yo son. He loves the microscope. I absolutely love the box these are held in.</p>

<h5 id="disappointing-dash-many-blank-slides">Disappointing Dash many blank slides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How many slides that were supposed to have something on them had nothing on them.</p>
