<h5 id="amazing-screen-great-value-great-purchase">Amazing screen, great value, great purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You honestly cannot find a better premade projector screen for the price. Not only is it the best value screen, it&rsquo;s good enough to be used as a permanent screen and it gets the job done. This is my first projector screen I&rsquo;ve ever had and although it is not perfect, it surely did exceed my expectations. I&rsquo;m very picky and have a keen eye for imperfections. Originally I was concerned with wrinkles, lines, and curves that will be too obvious and will distort/warp movies and games. The screens did come with lines and wrinkles, however, but fortunately it did not affect performance. The lines are barely visible from normal lighting or from the front but is more noticeable from the side with direct lighting. I tested watching movies and playing games on it for five plus hours and I never noticed anything distorted or bothersome.I was previously looking at &lsquo;tensioned&rsquo; screens to get a true flat screen but they usually run for $500-600. I paid less than $100 for this screen that comes with some minor wrinkles that doesn&rsquo;t affect the performance is totally worth it for me. The only issue is the slight smell that it does have and the lack of mounting screws. Other than that I&rsquo;m super happy with the purchase.Pros:- Lightweight and easy to handle.- Great value for the price.- Works great for movies and games.- Smoother and brighter than a white wall but not overly bright.Cons:- Minor wrinkles but nothing major. Mainly an OCD thing.- Slight smell that takes a while to go away.- No mounting screws.(Pictures are taken with a direct white light shining to emphasize the wrinkles. With my normal yellow room light on it&rsquo;s not as noticeable)</p>

<h5 id="excellent-value">Excellent Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is an excellent value – high quality materials and construction. It lays flat and is easy to install. The packaging is phenomenal. Two minor things I would note are:1. The screen makes a scraping noise against the housing when it rolls up. I don&rsquo;t think this is causing any damage, but I&rsquo;m not absolutely certain.2. I previously bought the 80&rdquo; version of this screen (also excellent), but when I compare them side-by-side, the 80&rdquo; one is a brighter white – a &ldquo;daylight&rdquo; white as opposed to an &ldquo;eggshell&rdquo; white for the 100&rdquo; model. The projected images look fine to me on both, but if you are looking for the brightest possible white, you might consider the 80&rdquo; model. The difference in screen material may just be the difference between lots in manufacturing, so no guarantee the 80&rdquo; one would be brighter.I found the manufacturer&rsquo;s dimensional specifications insufficient for my needs, so here are some additional measurements for those who may be interested:• Overall end-to-end length 94 <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo;• Center-to-center of mounting holes 93 <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo;• Length of screen housing 93 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>:• Width of screen housing 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;• Height of screen housing (including horizontal pull bar attached to screen) 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;• Screen fabric width 90&rdquo;• Screen fabric height (fully extended) 52&rdquo;• Black border width around perimeter of screen 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;One last comment: The retractor mechanism on this screen seems strong and likely to last well. I considered some motorized screens, but in the end decided they were ugly, complicated, and expensive. If you are making a simple home theater, I don&rsquo;t think you can go wrong with this screen. It makes for a pretty awesome picture.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product, works perfectly for our outdoor movies with the neighbors! Fast shipment, great packaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-great-the-screen-comes-rolled-up-in-a-tub">It works great. The screen comes rolled up in a tub</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this screen so I could create an outdoor movie area for my roof deck. I built a PVC frame and purchased Tekton Tarp Clips and Kotap Ball bungees to secure the screens to the frame. It works great. The screen comes rolled up in a tub which I still use for storage. It is a nice quality material that is thick enough to hold up to the cross winds on my roof. There is a black border around the white part of the screen that contrasts very well with the eyes while viewing and the screen material really makes the projector image pop (I use just a white wall for my bedroom projector and this screen makes a TON of difference in making the colors more vibrant). The only real criticism I have for this product is the chintzy adhesive strips that come with the screen. It is nice that they include a way to mount it, but it is mostly useless as I found that the screen is too heavy to stay mounted using the provided strips. I will definitely be buying another of these screens soon for use in my bedroom ( I will build a black wooden frame for this use and hang it on the wall). As long as you understand that you will have to make arrangements for the mounting, this product is exactly what I was looking for and I have not been disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-a-budget-home-theater">Great for a budget home theater</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a surprise gift for my husbands 40th birthday. We are on a budget but I really wanted to give him the home &ldquo;theater&rdquo; experience he has been wanting. I liked that the price of this Projector screen and I liked that it could be ceiling mounted. Those two features were both very important in my search. I am not up to date on technology or the latest and greatest home theater equipment so I relied heavily on amazon reviews and a bit of google research for this project. I am pleasantly surprised and very happy with this purchase. My husband was tickled. He was able to install it pretty easily. Very clear instructions. And with a little elbow grease we had it ceiling mounted in no time. It pulls down and retracts with ease. I have included a picture that shows the comparison of this screen to our 65 inch flat screen tv to show the size. I also bought a projector and upon using it the screen performed wonderfully. Our media room is a large 24x24 room with no windows so we do not have to fight with outside light. The screen allowed the projector to display vibrant colors and features. I am very happy with this projector screen and look forward to many family movie nights.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see the wrinkling others complained of. I&rsquo;ve used it for a week so far. It seems to work well. Retraction takes some practice.</p>
