<h5 id="good-but-a-little-small">Good but a little small&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good stand seems to be built well but from my opinion not the best one in this price range. I have two other tv stands so I felt I could make a good comparison review.HEIGHT ADJUSTMENTS : The Echogear has four height adjustments in the back of the column where you remove 4 screws then move these screws to the next set of holes. My AEON model has three height adjustments where no screws need to be removed. To make the adjustment you simply change the vertical bars in one of three levels . I have attached a picture of the height differences between the two models . I bought the Echogear model for a 50 inch tv which works well and gives me about 3~4 inches of space between the bottom of the tv and the metal base . Note if you are considering the Echogear for a 55&rdquo; to 65&rdquo; TV you will have little to no space underneath your TV for components or to mount a soundbar underneath. This is because the total max height on the Echogear is much lower than on the AEON model.BASE: The immediate difference is that the AEON base is about 25~30% larger. I like the larger base because it allows me to put components on the glass under the tv . If I put my cable box on the Echogear model it is too deep and hangs off the front of the base . The Echogear base is stamped shell from thin metal to create a thick look. It is a black matte painted finish. The AEON model is very thick black tinted glass . This could be a personal prefernce but I like the look of the AEON much better and my concern with the metal base is that it will scratch and dent over time, where as the glass still looks great after 8 months of heavy use .COLUMN : The Echogear model is a two part column made of metal. The lower column has a small plate on the bottom which is welded in place with four small threaded screws to hold it in place. The inner column is small and slides inside the larger column to offer height adjustment capability . The Echogear column is painted with a flat black matte finish. The AEON model is a two part column system as well but of the same size on top and bottom . The upper part is for the swivel functionality . The AEON model is held to the glass plate with two large full length threaded rods which clamp between the glass and the top of the column forming a sandwhich. As a previous welder myself I like the idea that the AEON has no welds to fail. The outer finish of the AEON column is a high gloss black painted finish .SWIVEL: The Echogear and the AEON models both have good swivel range and function. The AEON model seems to swivel with a little less ease.STABILITY : The Echogear and the AEON both seems like they are strong and stable tv stands. I have a 50&rdquo; 40 pound tv on the Echogear and a 60&rdquo; 58 pound tv and 10 pound soundbar on the AEON . Neither model leans , but my Echogear does tilt down to the left on one side a few degrees . I put a shim in to fix this problem.ASSEMBLY: Echogear has the slight advantage here, I put the Echogear together in about 15 minutes or so and the AEON model took me about an additional 5 minutes.OVERALL : Overall this Echogear is a good tv stand and I will not be returning this model . But my personal preference is the AEON for the appearance, larger base, and additional height under tv . I&rsquo;d give the Echogear a 4.1 star and the AEON a 4.7 star.</p>

<h5 id="great-find">Great Find</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a new TV only to discover once unboxed, that it has two spindly legs on each end and would not fit on my TV stand. I loved my TV stand and didnt want to spend hundreds of dollars on a comparable stand. I was sure other people had encountered this same problem, so immediately went to Amazon to find a solution. I am so happy to find the EchoGear stand. It was easy to assemble, much sturdier that the legs that came with the TV and best of all, fits my corner TV stand. And I love that it can swivel. Thank you ECHOGEAR.</p>

<p>5 stars because I really like it. However the holes didn&rsquo;t line up for my new Vizio 50&rdquo; TV. Had to drill them out a little to fasten. That wasn&rsquo;t a problem, my Son took care of for me. If someone was not capable of adjusting in this manner, that would be a problem.My sons ready to get one for his 65&rdquo; VizioHoping this company makes. We enjoyed the wit!</p>

<h5 id="liked-it-so-much-i-bought-a-second-one">Liked it so much, I bought a second one.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stand may be a bit more expensive than some others offered here, but it&rsquo;s worth it.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and attention to detail that went into making and even packaging it. The instructions are easybti fillow, and were written with a wonderful touch of humor, which I appreciate immensely. There were zero problems with the quality or quantity of the parts included. I had bought two cheap 4K TVs from Costco, and they had similarly cheap stands. The type of &ldquo;stand&rdquo; (cheesy plastic legs) that is popular for OEMs to use at present is horrid, and not suited for a variety of places you might want to put a TV. So this stand worked very, very well, it was so easy to put together, and it allows me to position my TVs with the flexibility I really need, including much easier height adjustability than the expensive wall mount I have for my living room TV. If I need another stand in the future, this will be the one I choose, even before a wall or ceiling mount.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-tv-stand">Excellent TV stand!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This universal wall mount is exactly as advertised. I bought it for my Samsung 55 inch TV Model UN 55ES6150FXZA that had been mounted on a wall for about 5 years, and due to a construction project inside my condo, the TV had to be taken off the wall, so we decided to put the TV on a cabinet. This stand is perfect. I searched the internet for a likely stand and settled on this one. Good decision, as it was easy to assemble with just a Philips screwdriver and all the necessary assembly parts were included for the set up of the stand. The stand is working perfectly (swiveling etc) and I am very happy with this purchase. The company provides a number to call if you need help to set up the stand but we did not need help because good and easy to follow directions were included in the box. I also like the quirkiness of some of the comments in the directions and on their site. Someone has a sense of humor! I thought the price was reasonable because I called Samsung and they were going to charge substantially more for a stand that, as described by the salesperson I spoke to, was cheaply made and did not swivel. I also looked on eBay and for about $20 less, I could have gotten a used stand that had come with this particular model TV, but there were no refunds, and the picture on eBay showed what looked like a battered and beat-up, used stand. So, when I found this Echogear Universal Stand, I decided to go with it and, as I&rsquo;ve already said, I am glad I did!! Great product. Thank you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This, so far, has been an outstanding product. It was easy to assemble, and quick. I had no problem attaching the TV to the stand, and is much more stable than the two legged stand my TV came with. I could have purchased any TV atand from ANYwhere, BUT&hellip;I chose, you, ECHOGEAR, because of your humorous marketing. It pleased me, and made me smile, with everything I opened and read, so, there, you guys got that going for you! Seriously, I NEVER pay regular price for ANYTHING, and here I AM SPENDING MORE $$ Than I would have liked to, JUST BECAUSE you guys were funny. ??? Go figure&hellip;</p>
