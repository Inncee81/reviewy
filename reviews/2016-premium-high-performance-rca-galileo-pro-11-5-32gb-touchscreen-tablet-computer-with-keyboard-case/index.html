<h5 id="nice-tablet">Nice tablet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tablet is loaded with features. It has a nice size keyboard where you can actually type papers and letters on a web based word processor. The processor is <em>very</em> fast, and there is no wait. Sound is very nice and loud enough to actually hear uTube videos. Lots of buttons to control the tablet in nice locations. I get 5 hours battery life watching uTube videos. It has android 6, which it is very slick and smooth. I was able to take my phone info/settings and transfer to the tablet seemlessly. I connect via wireless and it has not lost the connection from usage all day and night; mostly watching video. Where I work, everybody has a tablet. Out of the 50 or so tablets, this RCA tablet is faster, nicer, and cost <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> as much</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s a computer with a big screen but it is light weight! It is easy to start up and running when you get it ad works great! It has a USB port and the tablet is detachable from the buttons! It is also touch screen! HERE IS THE BEST PART: WHEN YOU CHARGE THE TABLET IT CHARGES THE KEYBOARD AT THE SAME TIME!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-tablet-bad-display">Good tablet bad display.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice tablet. Especially for the price. It&rsquo;s pretty fast and I love the screen size, but the picture quality is a little lacking. It&rsquo;s not HD and you have to play with the screen angle a bit to get the best view thus the 4 stars. It&rsquo;s probably not a great choice for gaming The keyboard is excellent. Nice and roomy, it&rsquo;s a rather large keyboard. I use it mostly for Bible study and other Christian material. The screen size is great for reading. I have the Kindle app on it and it works just fine. I&rsquo;m also a musician songwriter and I plan to put my music on it. I am pleased with the Galileo tablet and would recommend it for reading and maybe web surfing.Update,The more I live with this tablet the more I wish that I had spent a little more and got the Maven Pro. The low definition of the screen is starting to bother me. That is the only negative of this tablet. But the display is the main thing you interact with when you use it. I went ahead and ordered a Maven Pro for about $40.00 more. It actualy has an HD IPS screen. I&rsquo;ll review it when I&rsquo;ve used it a bit.</p>

<h5 id="very-unhappy-customer-save-your-money-buy-something-that-s-not-rca">VERY Unhappy Customer&hellip; Save your money &amp; buy something that&rsquo;s Not RCA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t Buy RCA&hellip; It&rsquo;s Not really RCA anymore!I Wouldn&rsquo;t Recomend This Product To Anyone&hellip; This Model is Prone To Heat Crack!- Which is <em>Not</em> covered under RCA (Venture Electronics INC.) 1 Year Warranty.I purchased &amp; received the Premium High Performance RCA Galileo Pro (11.5&rdquo;, 32GB, Model# RTC6513W87 DK, Charcoal) early April 2017. When I turned this thing on, it was a bit more than buggy to say the least&hellip; took me HOURS to get this thing to finially run like it supposed to. I had to disable about 75% of everything in the stock system apps, and what couldn&rsquo;t be disabled&hellip; I had to install a fire wall/data blocker to keep it at bay. Go figured it&rsquo;s the way they &ldquo;google&rsquo;ized&rdquo; this particular Android Marshmallow that was the cause of all the bugginess&hellip;&hellip; Anyways, after I finally got it to run right and found a replacement apps for almost everything that was stock, it ran great and was very reliable.I even forgave the fact that I ran into such a nightmare with this thing in the very begining.Then a little over 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months later, litterally after charging it overnight&hellip; a Huge screen crack that spans from the left of the USB keyboard to the charging plugin (upper mid left side of tablet) suddenly appeared!!! I lost about 90% of all touch screen function thus far and only have limited access now from the top right hand corner of the screen. Couldn&rsquo;t contact Amazon Customer Support about because it was beyond it&rsquo;s 30 days and because this is Obviously a manufacture flaw, it was covered under the RCA 1 Year Warranty, as stated in their own Owners Manual in the device. I didn&rsquo;t even mind the fact that i would have to pay to ship it to them for repair. I grew to really enjoy using this device with all it&rsquo;s nonstandard tablet features and wanted it fixed. So, I went to the RCA website, as recommended in their own manual&hellip; then called their US Customer Support/Repair 887 phone number because I was having so many issue using the site. Actually, I tried contacting their second phone number first (because it was an 800 number), but same automated message kept comming up saying their office is closed even though it was during their normal running bussiness hours. The 877 number was the first one on their list worked though, which I did get through the first time I called. I gave the representative all my info along with explaining the heat crack issue. She was very vague with every answer she gave me&hellip; but she did repeat twice that, due to the nature of this issue, it is covered under their 1 Year Warranty. The representative then gave me my &ldquo;prequalified repair number&rdquo; (or whatever it&rsquo;s called) then advised me to the RCA Tablet Support/Repair site, fill out the form and add the prequalification number she gave me, then advised to state in exactly what i told her in the &ldquo;description&rdquo; part of the form and it will be covered under warrabty. So I did what she advised then submitted the online form.The very next day (today, July 18th 2017), I received an email from RCA Repair to ship it (tablet part only) to &ldquo;Venturer Electronics INC.&rdquo; in NY. But then there was was this other statement in the email that said &ldquo;NOTE: If this product has any sign of physical damage (ie. cracked screen, water damage, accidental damage) or has virus/malware, it is no longer covered under warranty.&rdquo; &hellip;Well this statement really bothered me, for the obvious reason that the screen is heat cracked (due to a manufacturing flaw). The email was very blunt when it came to the fact that <em>Any</em> screen crack was not cover under the warranty and was complete contradictory to what the representative told me the day before. So I contacted the RCA Customer Support/Repair 877 number again to get further clarification regarding that email&hellip; and they blocked my phone number!!!! Well, I couldn&rsquo;t get through with my phone so i called that same phone number using my dad&rsquo;s phone instead and got through. After over 30 minutes of waiting in que, and wasting all that cell time my poor dad pays each minute for, I hung up and called the second customer support number, just in case, but that phone number still played the same automated message stating their office was closed eventhough it was during their standard bussiness hours.At a complete lose of what to do next, I then went online to try to get the phone number for the Venturer Electronics repair facility in NY only to find out that they had no actual phone number (other than the 2 US RCA phone numbers) on the actual Venturer Electronics site. Then I found All These Complaints from multiple people (well over a dozen) regarding sending their tablet to the NY repair facility for warranty repair and they never receive their tablet back or even money back&hellip; and are litterally left with nothing other than the USB keyboard and adapter that they were told not to ship! They all claim it gets shipped to NY, and from there, shipped to Canada under a different tracking number. At, least that was what was expressed in the complaints when customers could get a hold of them and got the runaround&hellip;. I&rsquo;m Way Too Afraid Now to send this thing to to them for repair (under warranty or not), after having them block my phone number with no other way to contact them and seeing what happens after people try to ship their device to them for warranty repair&hellip;. I mean the product gets put into a shipping limbo with no way for the customer to track it under their tracking#!Save your money and buy something else. RCA is no longer the actual RCA company anymore and their 1 year warranty means absolutely nothing.I hope Amazon cares enough about me to help rectify this issue&hellip; because I&rsquo;ve Tried Everything.I&rsquo;ve been a very faithful Amazon customer for many years and I don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore. :/</p>

<h5 id="my-rca-galileo-tablet-review">My RCA Galileo tablet review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a little skeptical about if i wanted to keep this tablet when i received it. after a few days of using it, i decided i like it. the buttons are large enough to type fast and it has all the features and more than I expected. i purchased it because my Acer Chromebook took a dump after 1 year. I use it for checking email, surfing web, and purchases from my favorite online stores. I like the touch screen feature that my Chromebook did not have. I don&rsquo;t play video games, but many games are available to download from google play. I am a happy customer.</p>
