<h5 id="great-bluetooth-headphones">Great Bluetooth headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These headphones are great, battery life is long sound is great. They are comfortable for me with the buds that are on it but they come with other sizes which is nice. The Bluetooth works well and is easy to connect. The case holds them well to allow them to be stored or transported while being protected. Has enough room for all items and charging cord which is provided. Couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bluetooth-headphones-for-20-dollars">GREAT BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES FOR 20 DOLLARS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased these headphones I was really not expecting that much. I mean how good can 20 dollar Bluetooth headphones really be?The answer is surprisingly good&hellip;. with a few exceptions.first of all the good:These headphones arrived in a simple brown box with minimal branding. Inside I found the headphones themselves, an instructional manual for pairing and operation, several ear pieces and a nice nylon carrying case.the audio quality is quite good for budget headphones getting loud enough for they gym and quiet enough for drifting off to sleep. I don&rsquo;t remember them mentioning any noise canceling capabilities in the description but they do block out a good majority of ambient noise.They will stay in my ears comfortably without becoming painful after long periods of time like i experience with apple headphones.The battery life is good and charges quickly. I easily get through my daily routine (bicycle commute, work, gym) on a single charge.THE CONS:The Bluetooth seems to have difficulty with connectivity through the human body. When the receiver is on the opposite side from my phone pocket It experiences some cut out intermittently. strange because I can also walk around corners in my office about 30+ feet away with out experiencing any of the same issues.Occasionally it will begin searching for a device while I am currently listening causing me to have to power down the headphones and power them back on to get rid of the issuethe arms that hook into your ears work well but will come off their tracks quite easily if manipulated too much.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-sound">Wonderful sound!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Bluetooth technology allows me to wear without being held down by wires to my phone. I can go 20 feet into another room before it starts to fade in and out. Great for talking or listening to music. Comes with what you see in picture all in a nice compact case to fit in purse. Takes about 2 hours for full charge. Not sure how long it takes to use up its stored power yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I finally received aelec Bluetooth earphone, it took me very long time to choose through all different kinds of Bluetooth earphone, and It takes longer time to get Hawaii, but it worth to wait! I just tried it;) it&rsquo;s very easy to pair with the phone and the tone quality is very good too! I love it a lot;)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-comfortable">Very comfortable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This headset used to replace my old headphones, the effect is amazing. Very comfortable When I was running outdoors and the sound was perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Resllly good sound, sounds perfectly clear. The earbuds are a little weird to put on, but other than that the quality of the music and noise is really great. Also comes with its own charging cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bluetooth-headphones-wireless-in-ear-sports-earbuds">Bluetooth Headphones Wireless In-Ear Sports Earbuds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these ears phones! They have great sound. They are soft and don&rsquo;t hurt my ears. Bluetooth connect that pairs quickly with my device, easy on and off and they are rechargeable. I found them to be simple enough to use with out using the manual. I haven&rsquo;t taken a call from my device with them yet, I use them to listen to my Amazon music app and they work great!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bluetooth-headphones-that-stay-in-my-ears-these-work-great">Bluetooth Headphones that stay in my ears!!! These work great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These have a great design that actually keeps the earbuds in your ears. I just used them while I was outside gardening and the sound is really very impressive for a headphone set for this price. It is an excellent value and so comfortable. If you want a very reasonable priced set of earphones that actually don&rsquo;t fall out of your ears&hellip;these are for you. Recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-price-below-average-sound">Good price, below average sound</h5>

</blockquote>

<p>Great sound and I&rsquo;m grateful for the variety of sizes on the ear buds and ear canal holders (not sure what that little piece is called).</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-them-but-wish-they-had-a-battery-indicator">Love them, but wish they had a battery indicator</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good sound (although I listen to podcasts mostly, not music), comfortable, easy to use, paired with all my devices with no issues. I wish they had a battery indicator somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="uncomfortable-headphones">Uncomfortable Headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>most uncomfortable headphones I&rsquo;ve ever purchased. They constantly slip out of your ears when working out which is strange because they were designed to be used for when you&hellip;</p>
