<h5 id="looks-to-be-a-good-piece-of-equipment">Looks to be a good piece of equipment.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a GoPro product and I knew that going in. I am using a GoPro Hero 4 Black. The fit of the camera in the case is very good, the camera is well positioned and snug. The back door fits well and has a good seal. Access to the USB and HDMI connectors is good. The case is thick and looks like it could withstand an impact.I bought because this because I didn&rsquo;t want to drill a hole in my GoPro case to get access to the USB connector which also serves at the mic input. I have been using the case and it seems like a good product. I will update this review should I have any problems with the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-poor-clip-design-i-wouldn-t-buy-this-again">Very poor clip design, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ya gotta be gentle with the locking clamp. It could break if you aren&rsquo;t careful.* update: after using this for several weeks&hellip;the clip mechanism is nearly garbage. It takes a lot of force to close it and when it is open, the clamp typically falls off the case! Buy a different one! Doesn&rsquo;t need to be the GoPro brand, but pay close attention to the clip style and get one that is like the GoPro brand case that has the metal loop mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-many-problems-with-this-case">too many problems with this case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The good:Fits my Gopro Hero4 Silver wellAllows access to ports so you can charge the camera when it is being used. (4+hours as a dash cam)I have been using the standard waterproof case that came with the camera but wanted a case that will allow me to record road trips longer then the batter would last.The bad:The clip that holds the case shut. it popped off every time I opened it.A black rubber strip covers half the screen on the hero4 silver.The mounting area was very sung and had a hard time re connecting to the mount.Because of the clip problem I had to remove the case from the mount then remove the camera from the case. when I wanted to change memory card or take the camera out. The clip would also click on in the wrong direction which would make you have to pop it back off then on again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-i-wanted-but-with-shortcomings-w-update">What I Wanted but With Shortcomings w/Update</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the idea of an option to have a housing with the power hookup exposed for long exposures. Camera mounted on front windshield. I&rsquo;ve gotton 4 hour videos w/an external battery source and USB power adapters plugged into the cigarette lighter.The problem is the latch! Very cheap, has come apart twice, and very, very hard to undo after you get the camera aimed right. You&rsquo;d think you could just reach up, undo the latch and remove the camera so as not to mess up the aim &hellip; not so. I have to dismount the housing to unlatch the back to get the camera out thereby messing up the aim. When I&rsquo;m ready for another session I have to remount the housing, go thru the app to get everything set, aim and then go. A burden! The right sized rubber band will probably work.UPDATE: May 29, 2014. Since my initial review, latch has completely failed and came off the housing. However, shortly after buying this housing I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DYQQEES/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DYQQEES/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a> . Turns out it was a blessing in disguise. I can put the housing in the cover, after cutting away the back and side (port) of the cover skin, to provide just enough grip to keep the door snug. Works like a champ! Still sticking with my 2 star rating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tough-and-convenient">Tough and Convenient.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this skeleton housing for the purpose of attaching a microphone and charge cable to the unit without having to open the unit up. It is well put together and I use it a lot for duck hunting. I would and probably will purchase another if I choose to buy another GoPro camera. Well worth the money for a product that will likely last as long as you are alive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed-for-my-gopro-hero-3-to">Just what I needed for my GoPro Hero 3+ to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I needed for my GoPro Hero 3+ to attach to my motorcycle helmet. However, GoPro adapter (connects in USB for microphone) doesn&rsquo;t fit through slot perfectly, so when I plug it in while housing is on it doesn&rsquo;t go in all the way. Still works, though. If it causes issues I&rsquo;ll probably just file the hole larger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this a lot. I can set it up in our shop when we are setting up large machines and you can take pictures like every thirty seconds and leave it there all day while it is plugged in. Without this, you can&rsquo;t plug it in and leave it set up all day, the battery will die.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="then-ended-up-buying-the-housing-at-all-works-fine-but-i-wish-i-was-told-of-this-requirement">Then ended up buying the housing at all works fine but I wish i was told of this requirement &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased the power pole on Amazon and no where was it mentioned that the Skeleton housing will be required to plug in the cable from the pole to the housing. Then ended up buying the housing at all works fine but I wish i was told of this requirement by Amazon or Gopro when i was ordering the power pole.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>could use a smoother clip on the bottom and a larger top latch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t work with standard GoPro rear covers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works like advertised. Great price compared to GoPro.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="incompatible-with-gopro-back-plates">Incompatible with GoPro back plates.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not compatible with GoPro backplates. I feel misled.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good case&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good to go</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="spend-the-money-on-gopro-brand">Spend the money on GOPRO brand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Threw it in the trash and ordered the go pro brand. It pushed on my go pro screen causing the screen to turn different colors and the go pro doors wouldn&rsquo;t fit it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-cheap-quality-the-latch-is-not-attached-at">Very Cheap Quality. The latch is not attached at &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very Cheap Quality. The latch is not attached at the back and falls off. Wish I had not purchased it. Going to but a REAL spare housing and drill a hole for the power cord.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-good">Works good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to file away part of the opening so my USB cable would fit. Works good, but wish they would leave some space for fat USB cables.</p>
