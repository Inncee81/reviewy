<h5 id="half-the-price-same-great-quality">Half the price, same great quality&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second TV mount I bought this month, and is the cheaper of the two. The TV I was mounting on it was a 42&rdquo; Vizio for my bedroom, so I wasn&rsquo;t as concerned with the weight bearing capacity of the unit. Having just done the other one last weekend it was a breeze to mount this one on my own. Two small pilot holes to verify the stud, then a thicker bit to pre-drill where the carriage bolts were going in. The bracket itself is sturdy, and has great articulation, despite the fact that I&rsquo;ll keep it pushed flush up against the wall.Took 20 minutes to get the measurements double checked, bracket installed, TV leveled, and Netflix up on screen. Well worth the money, and honestly no huge difference between this and the $42 one I purchased. Would happily recommend this to friends.</p>

<h5 id="deserves-6-stars-for-quality-and-included-parts-very-sturdy-in-wall">Deserves 6 stars for quality and included parts. (VERY STURDY IN WALL)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could rate this TV mount 6 stars, I would! I never had a tv mount before since it seemed like it would be a big hassle to make holes in the wall and I never quite trusted my tv hanging on a mount. I saw this mount on sale for dirt cheap compared to best buy charging $70 for a lesser quality so I decided to take a plunge! First I&rsquo;d like to say that this mount kit comes with EVERYTHING YOU NEED in the box from the screws to the spacers! I&rsquo;m a handy guy but I was a little intimidated looking at everything in the box but I made this mount a project for the weekend and got it INSTALLED IN UNDER 30 MINUTES (32 inch tv. through 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> thick dry wall). I did need to go buy a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> drill bit to make it a clean job.Tools you will need: Power drill, stud finder , correct drill bits to make your holes and I personally used Snap Toggle bolts since I could not drill into the thick metal studs that my condo uses.Tips:- If you cannot drill into your studs then use Snap Toggle bolts hold tv&rsquo;s perfectly through at least an inch of drywall, use at LEAST 4 of them and you will never have issues. (new and improved 6 pack sold at Home Depot for $7&hellip;well worth it!)- You can use the cable ties to keep the cords looking neat or you can drill through the wall to hide them (takes a few mins)- I have included the picture of the Hillman Snap Toggle bolts if you want to try them out. I mounted a 32 inch tv that only weighed 27lbs and these bolts are rated to hold 80lbs each.IF you have any questions, feel free to ask me.</p>

<h5 id="great-mount-for-more-then-half-the-cost">Great Mount For More Then Half The Cost.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love having this for my TV. Very easy to setup and my TV hangs great using it. I love that I only have to search for 1 stud in the wall to mount it especially with my walls were you never know were or how far apart the studs are in the wall. I had more issues trying to use a stud finder to find a stud to mount with then I did mounting my tv using this tv wall mount. I like that it swivels in just about any direction needed and can be tilted down pretty far as well as a bit upwards if needed. This all goes without saying that it does (like anything on the market) have some cons. It came with a very small bubble level that was a bit defective. If you tilted the level to the left and then level it, it would get stuck all the way left till you tilted it back to the right then level it. This for some could be an issue if that have the same problem cause if they are like me and don&rsquo;t have a real level to use they are stuck either going out to buy 1 or using the one that came with the tv wall mount. I managed fine with the included 1 considering the con. This thing came with a lot of bolts, washers and parts for just about any tv needing hung up. My tv manual states my tv is a Vesa 400x400 which this mount states you would have to use the arms included to for that type of tv. I think my tv manual was wrong about the vesa size cause I didn&rsquo;t use any of the arms for my tv at all but I did have to use 1 set of the included large washers cause the bolts to screw into the tv were either to short or to long without using them, no big deal it worked out great, it looks great and my tv is sitting pretty on the wall like it belongs there. I&rsquo;m not going to take a star off for any of the cons I have cause this tv mount works just as good if not better then the way over priced ones at more then over half the cost. I have this mounted to a Samsung KU6300-Series 40&rdquo; 4k TV.</p>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this mount. Can&rsquo;t beat it for the price. Holds my 50&rdquo; Samsung smart TV (2014 model) fine, never had any problems. Very easy to mount, and equally easy to move the TV around. The arm is not long enough to be able to turn a 50&rdquo; TV completely perpendicular to the wall, but I&rsquo;m not sure why you would ever want or need to do that. Good enough for me to swing it out and pivot it so I can watch from the kitchen while I&rsquo;m cooking.</p>

<h5 id="mounting-dream-perfect-name-perfect-product">Mounting Dream: Perfect name&mdash;perfect product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best packaged products I have experienced with any mechanical/self install item I have ever purchased. Online or in a retail store. Packaging??? He&rsquo;s ecstatic about the package?? Yes, I am. Best part is the phenomenal combinations provided regarding one&rsquo;s particular TV. There was no running to the garage looking for a tool or even a jury-rig part.. Everything is there. Even a small level. It was included. Mounting Dream allowed for no confusion. Allen wrenches, level bolts, washers, et al . Actually, you are left with enough spare parts and tools to setup a little installation business at home. I didn&rsquo;t have to call for help until it was time to hoist the TV to slide it in the bracket. Which was a breeze, and sturdy enough to not worry one iota about future troubles. Did I mention the HDMI cord was included? Now I have.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-fit-200x300-without-being-offset">Does not fit 200X300 without being offset</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mount itself seems very solid. I have a 40&rdquo; Sony mounted on it. What is odd is this is the first mount I&rsquo;ve ever bought that didn&rsquo;t make allowances for any bolt pattern. It does not fit the one Sony uses if you follow the instructions. It will not fit 200X300. It doesn&rsquo;t say it does if you read the complete description, but the title says up to 400X400. Honestly, I&rsquo;ve never measured a single TV I&rsquo;ve mounted. This isn&rsquo;t some off brand.Now if you do have a Sony or other TV with that hole pattern, you can leave off the extension brackets on one side and it will fit. Since it&rsquo;s a fairly light TV, I felt comfortable doing that. So, I should have checked, my bad, but with 4 additional holes, it would cover installing another major brand&rsquo;s TV&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-good-product">Overall good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product came on time, which I appreciate a lot. It was easy to assemble. The part is that the dry wall anchors didn&rsquo;t work as well for me. I recommend to drill into the stud.</p>
