<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to get a portable projector screen to watch movies in our backyard during warm summer nights, or bring it to boy scout overnight camping trips. I have done a lot of research trying to get the right product for my needs. The inflatable screen is too noisy and not to mention the electricity to power up the fans. I ordered a portable screen last year and had to return it because of defects and discoloration on the screen. I decided to give this one a try because the price is right. The product arrived well-packaged in a good condition within 2 days even with standard shipping from Amazon.1) Ease of Setting upIt took me and my son about 15 minutes to set this screen up. It might take twice as long doing it by yourself, but once you are familiar with it you could cut down the setup time even more. It is definitely easier to take down, I did it by myself in less than 10 minutes. It is quite simple since each tube is labeled accordingly, all I have to do is matching up both ends. If you plan to re-assemble it frequently, I would recommend protecting the labels with tape since they might wear off. Because of its size, it might help to either tilt or lie it down on the ground during assembly, especially if you are doing it by yourself. Once you put the frame together, you would then slip the screen on over it. Once completed, it took the two of us to move the screen to the right distance from the projector. Then simply attach the stakes to anchor it down which is quite stable to withstand some wind.2) Quality MaterialThe tubes that make up the frame are quite sturdy. I suppose you could leave it outdoor under the rain and the sun, but you might want to use a piece of tarp to cover it. I prefer to take it down after use, since the dis-assembly is rather simple and it comes with a bag to store everything. The screen&rsquo;s fabric is also made out of a strong material, it has a backing made of black fabric so it is not transparent which prevents light from penetrating through. To get rid of the crease on the screen due to the packaging, I sprayed a bit of water and they went away as it stretched over the frame.3) PortabilityThe carrying case is medium duty material and stores the tubes and the screen perfectly. It is rather heavy to transport, but it&rsquo;s a good trade off for stability and durability. Since I plan to use this at home, at the campgrounds, at church events and other outdoor parties, this feature is very high on my list.4) Screen sizeThe screen I bought in the past was 100 inch wide diagonally, I didn&rsquo;t expect the additional 20 inch with this screen gives the perception of a much bigger viewing area. Together with my HD projector at 1080p resolution, I got thumbs up and compliments from all my guests.I highly recommend this product, you will not regret it.</p>

<h5 id="beasty-screen-with-a-few-niggling-issues-here-and-there">Beasty screen with a few niggling issues here and there.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a MASSIVE screen, which I would only recommend for professional level video enthusiasts. It&rsquo;s main purpose it&rsquo;s used for our group is convention use.The size of it means it will not fit in a normal household, at over 11 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet tall.A problem that isn&rsquo;t outlined in putting it together, the fully constructed framework is so tight, that trying to pull the screen down is next to impossible.I ended up ripping part of the left side as a result.Since then we&rsquo;ve worked out a better way to set up.Simply do not connect the bottom cross length together. Leave it loose, and the screen will side down with ease. It&rsquo;ll take a bit of work to then connect the pole to the cross section, I&rsquo;d recommend leaving it open at one of the &rsquo;T&rsquo; sections.Also remember you will need the exact amount of space this screen takes up, on the floor to put it together. It&rsquo;s like raising a barn door.The other problem is an image this large, at 180 inches, most normal projectors do not accommodate this size well. You will need a much higher end projector that can handle this size. And the distance for most projectors to get this size is just past 20 feet. See how the image from your projector looks at that range before buying something this large.A couple other problems, the screen needs to be CAREFULLY folded up to fit back in the case properly. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll have to fold it again to get it in there. Also because of all the folds, you should have access to a steamer to get the folds out.The case itself is extremely solid, but it lacks a middle handle, with handles only on the end. The wheels help, but the position of them and the stands on the end means the case stands at a bad angle upright.If you&rsquo;re a DIY person, you can probably make a screen this large or the right size to fit your needs, but if you don&rsquo;t have time or wherewithal to screw around with that, then this is a good option to go with. Just realize there&rsquo;s a few tricks to owning and using this that aren&rsquo;t covered in the 1 page manual you get.</p>

<h5 id="good-quality-screen-for-a-great-price">Good quality screen for a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality screen for a great price. Build is solid, but assembly labels come off.Full review: This Elite screen is a good choice for someone who wants quality, but is not willing to pay $100s for an outdoor screen. The screen fabric is very durable and has relatively few creases. Those that do appear will stretch out once the fabric is placed on the screen (the fabric and the frame are stored separately in easy to carry bags). Assembly takes about 5 minutes (but see note below) and can easily be done with one person, although it is much easier with two. The fully assembled frame is solid enough and we noticed no issues when watching movies outside even with a small breeze. The screen should not be left outside.The assembly for this screen is very simple&hellip; as long as the labels stay on the parts (each piece has - in our case had - a sticker with a letter on it, which you just match to the next piece with the same letter). The labels came off after a few months, but by then we had assembled and disassembled the screen several times and did not need the instructions. This is really the only down side so far after months of use.</p>

<h5 id="great-screen-and-excelent-portibility">Great screen and excelent portibility</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is of very good quality in my opinion, not that I can afford to purchase a bunch of these and compare them side by side. I have yet to test it outdoors but works great to set up inside for movie nights. I have found that I set up the frame, pull the screen over the frame, steam out the wrinkles with a fabric steamer and then tighten up the Velcro straps on the back to make the screen taught. That seems to work best so that you don&rsquo;t have wrinkles on the screen. If you pull it taught first then steam it, you end up with saggy parts of the screen.</p>

<p>After a dozen or so uses its starting to rip on the seem. Gets packed away after each use so its been well taken care of and shouldn&rsquo;t be ripping.</p>

<h5 id="great-movie-screen">Great movie screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought the 150 inch screen to show movies outside for a group about 100 people or less. It comes with a heavy duty carrying case that rolls.</p>

<p>Screen is awesome. Came super wrinkled so after assembling, we used wrinkle releaser spray and that worked. Also did a low temp iron on it as well.</p>

<p>I was expecting a little better quality out of the screen. You need to assemble the frame which works out well. Trying to pull the screen material over the frame is the problem.</p>

<p>Nice screen</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="backyard-fun">Backyard fun</h5>

<p>The stand is stable. It&rsquo;s a little bit of work to assemble and disassemble. So we juts take the feet off and lean the screen against a wall in the garage.</p>
