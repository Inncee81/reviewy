<h5 id="wow-makes-me-feel-fantastic">WOW! Makes me feel FANTASTIC!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I look forward to using this machine every morning and evening. It&rsquo;s like a workout and body massage all in one! Feels so strange yet good all at once&hellip; but afterwards I feel fantastic. Ten minutes is a perfect amount of time and yes, I do max it out to the 50 setting that I love! I don&rsquo;t use the straps but the remote does come in handy. After two days of use, I felt &hellip; different &hellip; better &hellip; happier. For sure, it&rsquo;s a huge help with circulation and lymph drainage plus consistent bowel movement.I&rsquo;m prone to having cold hands and feet during the winter months but not anymore with consistent use of this machine. Libido has also gotten a boost too! My back feels really great afterwards. Not sure how/if it&rsquo;s promoting weight loss but I&rsquo;m not too concerned with that. I&rsquo;m extremely happy with this VibeSlim and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to supplement their workout or anyone who wants help with circulation and feeling better (goodness who wouldn&rsquo;t want that?) Might even help someone suffering from depression to shake off the gloom &hellip; boost the mood! Morning use before my work commute really has me WIDE AWAKE and feeling great. Reasonable price and well worth it! I hope it lasts over the years because I&rsquo;ll be using it pretty much every day. It&rsquo;s not that loud either so I can use it while watching TV. Best purchase of 2016!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-customer-service-4-spine-arthritis">Excellent Customer service, 4 spine arthritis</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: 5/11/17 excellent customer service! Received missing resistance band in less than a week after asking for it! :^) ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜„Bought for wife, she say&rsquo;s;&ldquo;Very sturdy build, there is a video on Youtube of the chinese manufacturers dropping the box about 10 times from 7-9 feet off the ground and the vibration plate was not damaged. That&rsquo;s why I purchased this unit. It is incredibly helpful for lumbar arthritis. Bending over from the waist and resting on a desk while standing with straight legs on plate. Also good for moving your lymph fluids if you have knee arthritis and cannot use a trampoline. &ldquo;</p>

<p>This is the perfect size and weight for my condo. I am able to move it easily&hellip;weighs 70lbs. It would have been nice to have received better information on use and recommended exercises. I found some web sites with posters but nothing is provided with this item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well, already seeing results with just 10 minutes a day of focused core training. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is that it has a very noticeable see-saw motion to it that you don&rsquo;t find on professional models. This can be very uncomfortable on your shoulders when doing planks, and hard on your heels if your legs are near the edges. Positioning more towards the center helps with this some.</p>

<h5 id="sciatica-pain-reduced-dry-skin-softer">. Sciatica pain reduced Dry skin softer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. Excellent quality machine. Was concerned it would be junky and cheap. It&rsquo;s the opposite. Great looking solid, well designed and heavy. It has wheels and you just tilt it and you can easily move itI am 67 and overweight. I thought I might not be able to stand on it without holding on. Well I can. I have sciatica and the first few days my back hurt worse and my outer thighs. Now my pain is much reduced. It lasts a while after you get off. It&rsquo;s quite a workout. It stimulates your bowed as well (in a good way) .It&rsquo;s winter and my skin has been dry. Now my legs are softer and not dry .If I remember to update I will let you know if my sciatica goes away completely</p>

<h5 id="this-vibration-platform-is-fantastic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-how-to-use-it-and-how-to-find-a-user-manual">This Vibration Platform is FANTASTIC! Here is What You Need to Know, How to Use It, and How to Find a User Manual!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I originally bought this vibration platform because I broke my wrist, and being unable to work out (I usually work out or dance at least five evenings a week, I have workout equipment at home (an elliptical machine, a stair machine, and a Pilates chair)) I wanted to do something for my body while I was unable to work out. Ironically, I broke my wrist while dancing! Both being mindful that weeks without being able to work out would not do my body well, and having read that a vibration platform can help strengthen bones (hello, broken wrist here), I decided to get a vibration platform. And after doing some research and reading lots of reviews about many of the different platforms available on Amazon, this is the one I decided to get.And I am so glad that I did!Here is what I have learned, and what you need to know, about this vibration platform.First of all, this thing does not come with anything remotely like a user&rsquo;s manual. At least mine didn&rsquo;t. And if you try searching online for the user&rsquo;s manual you won&rsquo;t find it. But what I did find was the user&rsquo;s manual for an identical vibration platform, only that has handrails attached. So all of the information and instructions and exercises are the same, minus the handrails! I found that manual by searching for &lsquo;confidence vibration plate owner&rsquo;s manual&rsquo;.And speaking of remotely, the remote definitely comes in handy when you want to switch speeds while on the platform (see what I did there? :-) )Also, a lot of people want to know whether this machine oscillates. That completely depends on what you mean by oscillate. If what you mean is going up-and-down alternating between feet, like a seesaw (teeter totter) rather than just vibrate, yes it does. In fact what I have learned is that the vibrating is basically that oscillation at very high speed (you can set it from speeds 1 to 50â€¦ 50 is the fastest vibration, 1 is the slowest oscillation).The next thing I learned was that, somewhat counter-intuitively, the slower the oscillation, the greater the workout. This is because at low speeds it makes you more wobbly, for lack of a better description, and so your core is firing all the time. At the higher speeds, as noted above, you are getting more of a vibration.Relatedly, the closer together your feet are the less oscillation you are going to get (and so the less core firing work out). If you think, again, of a teeter totter, this makes perfect sense: the closer to the center of the teeter totter, the smaller the up-and-down motion (oscillation). Way out at the ends of the teeter totter, the ends are going aaaaall the way up and aaaaall the way down (greater oscillation).Finally, does it work? In a word, yes! Of course that also depends on what you mean by it working. If you use this thing at lower oscillations, you will definitely feel your abs and core muscles working. That said, everything I&rsquo;ve read says that just standing there while it does its thing is not going to really make a huge difference, you need to be doing exercises while it&rsquo;s going. The user&rsquo;s manual (and also videos you can find online) will give you a good idea of how best to use this thing to its best advantage.Happy vibrating!</p>
