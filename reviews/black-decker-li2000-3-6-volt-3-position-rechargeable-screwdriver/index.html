<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking into getting a electric screw driver at a low cost because the battery of my drill die and I didn&rsquo;t want to pay over 50 dollars for a new battery just to use it as a screw driver. So I ended deciding to buy this model because of price and reviews. I received it and opened it right away to use it. It has little charge that worked fort what I needed it. The package instructions says to charge the first time for a minimum of 16 hrs. So I did that after. The weight and grip are very good. The tork and power are perfect. You have forward and reverse to screw in and screw out. You can also set it to manual screw in. Which is good to finalize tightening any screw. The ability to adjust the folding of the driver gives the chance to work around any job. This item comes with wall charger it also includes 2 bits in the package which is good for starters. You will need to buy additional sizes and shapes to get all your jobs done in a jiffy.What I would change from this item is to add a space where to put the 2 bits it comes with. Maybe a design in the actual driver that incorporates them in would be a solution.The battery life has been fine. It did run out of juice one time I was using it for a good while. The other times it has been OK. I try to keep it allways charged.</p>

<h5 id="good-value-good-screwdriver-some-minor-changes-i-would-recommend">Good value, good screwdriver, some minor changes i would recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i like this, seems to work well after initial charge out of the box. I do like how it snaps into 3 different positions, so its flexible in that capacity. Some comments as to why i did not give it 5 stars: The button that needs to be pushed down to screw is on the top which i think is a bit awkward. It works fine but im used to the older model where it was on the handle. Second, the 2 types of screwdrivers are on separate bits (the old model had one bit with each type on the different end), so you just need to keep track of both of these instead of just leaving one in the actual unit. Brings me to my last point, there is no carrying bag of anysort. I think a cheap carry case or bag would go a long way to keep track of the 2 bits and the charger. I use a ziplock bag which i guess is ok. Overall for the price I think this is good, but few minor tweaks would make this perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-odds-and-ends-projects">Great For Odds And Ends Projects</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After moving I lost my toolbox - it&rsquo;s probably packed up somewhere. I needed a screwdriver badly but since I am low on cash plus I know I have a good screwdriver somewhere I decided to get this one in a pinch.At this price point don&rsquo;t expect to get too much power. It is perfect for lightweight projects like putting together toys, screwing in wall plates etc. Anything above that, there really isn&rsquo;t enough torque. It comes with flat head and Philips bits, but no storage case. That&rsquo;s kind of a problem for me since I don&rsquo;t have a tool box now. There is no charge indicator on the screw driver which is no big deal for me. After use I just place it on the charger until it&rsquo;s needed again. You do have the ability to position the handle in 3 positions. You are also able to change this to a manual screw driver which is a nice addition.I&rsquo;m trying really hard to get used to the power switch being on the top and not underneath like a trigger. That would have to be my least favorite aspect of this tool.You won&rsquo;t be able to build a house with this, but for odds and ends projects around the house it is a handy and reliable tool.</p>

<h5 id="life-changing-too-for-me">Life changing too for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has been a life changer for me! Being single now I&rsquo;m having to do many things by myself. Some screws and things have been too tight for me to turn so I looked into something that would help. Boy did I find it!I love that you can bend it like a gun, or make it straight like a regular screwdriver. I keep it bent most of the time as that&rsquo;s what seems to work best for me.The charge stays on it a long time. I have gone through an entire house full of projects in one day and it stayed charge all that time.I highly recommend this screwdriver. I LOVE IT!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-necessity-in-my-home">A necessity in my home</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had three previous Black &amp; Decker hand-held power screwdrivers and have always loved them. Now, it&rsquo;s a matter of &ldquo;must have&rdquo; if I still expect to attach things to the walls or do the minor household repairs. There is no way that I can use a totally manual screwdriver any longer since I&rsquo;m a disabled senior so don&rsquo;t even think about asking to borrow this one! The price is reasonable enough that most homes should have at least one. I do find it unfortunate that I couldn&rsquo;t find one that had a replaceable battery because with each new model it seemed like the battery gave out earlier and earlier, but I guess that&rsquo;s the way of the world - planned obsolescence.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing">Disappointing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok for light use, but it struggles with more dense woods, even when pre-drilled. So I&rsquo;ve stripped a dozen screws. My biggest problem is the poorly designed power/direction switch. It&rsquo;s in an awkward spot, worse when you fold the handle into a &ldquo;gun&rdquo;. The driver direction is difficult to switch without stopping your work and fiddling with the screwdriver. In hindsight, a few more bucks would have gotten me a better and more useful driver.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handy-little-screwdriver-does-the-job">Handy little screwdriver, does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace my last Black &amp; Decker inexpensive screwdriver, which died. I needed it to screw in some inexplicably tiny Phillips screws that are supposed to attach the flap to my cat&rsquo;s door. The bits that came with this were too big, so I ordered an extra set, which were still too big, but still managed to drive in the recalcitrant little screws, probably stripping their hateful heads off. Of course, I ordered the wrong set, the ones that are double ended, which still work fairly well. You are supposed to use hex headed bits with this, lots of luck finding them.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-one-charge-lasts-a-long-time">Works great. One charge lasts a long time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. One charge lasts a long time. Would have preferred a cradle rather than a plug, but still good. Like the way the handle straightens out for screwdriver work.</p>

<p>I use this tool all the time for all miscellaneous jobs. It&rsquo;s quite powerful with good torque. I would recommend it for most small around the house jobs.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-even-drill-drill">Can&rsquo;t even drill, drill.</h5>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to drill a screw into a stud in the wall, so I couldn&rsquo;t mount my media set&hellip; I feel like that is a very minimal use of a drill, can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;d&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="horrible-purchase-do-not-buy-this">Horrible Purchase. Do not buy this!</h5>

<p>The product has NO power at all. Even in dry wall it sometimes stripped screws, and was really just useless.</p>
