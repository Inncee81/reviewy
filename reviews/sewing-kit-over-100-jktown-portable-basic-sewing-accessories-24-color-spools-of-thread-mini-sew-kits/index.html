<h5 id="well-thought-out-mending-kit">Well thought out mending kit&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best mending/sewing kits I have purchased. It really does have everything you need to make minor repairs to your clothing and linen items. They even have nail clippers! The needles and instruments are sharp and work well and there is a good selection of thread colors to choose from. The thread also appears to be of good quality that should hold up to wear. I also like the fact that you can easily spin more thread onto to these thread spools, whereas other ones I have gotten in the past are so small and dainty&hellip;doing such is a pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-kit-has-everything-you-need-for-sewing">This kit has everything you need for sewing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a perfect sewing kit for traveling. I purchased this kit because on my last business trip I accidentally tore my skirt. I had to go to the front desk and ask for the sewing kit which I was grateful they had one but the needle was flimsy and thread color didn’t match my skirt. That will never happen again with this well stocked sewing kit . It comes with everything you could need for sewing and doesn&rsquo;t take up a lot of space in your suitcase. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to use it yet, but I&rsquo;m sure it will come in handy when I travel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-sewing-kit">Fantastic sewing kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the PERFECT SEWING AND HOBBY KIT! I purchased this kit for a quick sewing repair and also so pleased it has crochet hocks and more! These are great for pulling those snags on sweaters as just hook the snag r damaged threads and pull through to inside for perfection! It came with many colors of threads, needles, thimble, measure, seam ripper, cutter, crochet hooks and knitting needles, etc.! I couldI love it! It&rsquo;s complete with all the tools you will need in sewing and they packed extra thread in case you ran out or loose one color. I love that it&rsquo;s small and compact and I can carry it whereever I go (vacation, road trip). Not only that, they also included some buttons in case of emergency.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this">Love this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking fir a kit to keep in the office. I have lost buttons, or my hem has fallen out right before an important meeting. I’ve been asked on numerous occasions, by co workers if I had a safety pin. So, I searched for a compact kit that I could store in my drawer but had all the basics. This is perfect. It came with everything needed to fix just about any wardrobe mishap. I love it, it has everything you need and then some. So compact, nicely organized and what a great prices!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-fantastic-kit-for-your-sewing-needs">A fantastic kit for your sewing needs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A really nice small kit with everything you need and expect in a sewing kit. Everything is nicely organized and ready for a emergency. Everyone needs a sewing kit because you never know when you need to re-attach a button or your hem comes out of your pants or dress. This set is perfect. This is just the ticket for people on the go, it&rsquo;s portable and fits in your suitcase and when you have a wardrobe malfunction and need to fix it fast you just pull out your handy dandy sewing kit. This kit has everything you need for a sewing emergency at or away from home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-designed-and-great-value-for-the-price">Well designed and great value for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well designed set, tons of variety of thread color &amp; every tool you can need for a quick or long sewing fiasco. The kit zips up nicely for easy containment and stores away nicely without taking up too much space. Forget the dollar store mini sew kits this is the only kit I’ll need again. No longer will i have to just settle for an alternative thread color or use my teeth to cut the thread; i now have all the variety and tools i could ever need for my sewing needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-starter-kit">Perfect starter kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice little starter kit. My daughter is learning how to sew and needed some of the basics. This comes with lots of different color threads, and all the starter items she needed. The bag itself is not overwhelming so it is easy to transport from home to her sewing classes. The bag also has a wrist strap which is convenient for her because she is also carrying her machine. I know eventually she will need something bigger, but for now, it is perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-useful">Very useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Color of threads in this kit are very natural. Like the two extra multicolor threads that make it easy to adjust to my daughter’s showchior skirts. This sewing kit contains lots of accessories including a crochet needle that I like to use to repair holes on sweaters. Very useful sewing kit that every family should have.My only suggestion is it will be better if the thimble could be a little bit longer so people like me, who has long nails, could fit in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-sewing-kit-ever">Best Sewing Kit Ever!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely nice sewing kit. So many pieces. I was surprised to see nail clippers and a crochet hook included! Wide array of colored threads with generous quantities.</p>
