<h5 id="why-i-love-the-standard-and-the-bad-stuff-you-need-to-know-before-you-fly">Why I LOVE the Standard AND THE BAD STUFF You Need To Know Before You Fly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THE GOOD: To anyone thinking the Standard is substandard - LOL - I own one and love it. It is the perfect drone for a first time pilot, and I know several experienced pilots who buy the Standard as back up drones. The main limitation of the Standard is that the range it can fly is about half of the higher up models, and it uses fewer GPS signals and has no downward looking visual &ldquo;eye&rdquo; like the advanced and pro, so it will drift more up down and sideways (but not a whole lot) and not land quite as accurately at the take off point automatically. I give mine a 15 foot radius for safety in landings and sometimes it will land 10-12 feet from take-off point on auto-land. Advanced and Pro stay within 2-6 feet usually. The controller is more limited with older technology. BUT the standard flies just as fast, and as high, takes just as good video and pics and is just as much fun as the $1000 models for <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the price. In the beginning you always want to fly within line of sight (Standard&rsquo;s limitations keeps you there) and legally you are ALWAYS supposed to fly line of sight.THE BAD: DJI leads a new user to believe all the built in guidance system will do everything for you from takeoff to landing. And it will, until it doesn&rsquo;t. That WILL happen, not an IF - it is a WHEN&hellip; You have 3 sensitive components talking to each other (controller / drone / smartphone) using both Wi-Fi and radio, plus very sensitive onboard compass and GPS. This overly complicated plumbing will fail at some point and it can happen even a few feet away. At that point, you need to switch to manual control immediately - and hope you have time. I have had compass errors happen 3 feet off the ground in auto land and the dreaded &ldquo;crazy flying meat slicer with 4 exposed blades&rdquo; needed to be grabbed by the landing gear to stop it from hitting things as it got confused and would not respond to the controller. BTW: A pair of chef&rsquo;s slice proof gloves is a great idea at take offs and landings, don&rsquo;t ask how I know.RULE NUMBER ONE: Always be prepared for the unexpected! Like flying a private plane the phrase &ldquo;hours of calm punctuated with seconds of panic&rdquo; applies here. Best advice for new pilots - learn to do everything manually first - especially landing - because at some point you will need that skill and need it FAST! Also never ignore the long boring preflight compass calibration. I do it every time I set up for flight, but my terrain is always varied from flight to flight. DJI says it isn’t necessary unless you move the unit over 100 miles – or change terrain dramatically, which I do almost every session, from lake, to desert, to high mountains. I like calibrating because not only does it re calibrate your compass - more importantly - it warns you if there are magnetic disturbances. If there are anomalies showing in the software messages - my advice is pack it up and move elsewhere, or fly totally on manual control. Ignore any of those warning at your own risk. Compass or GPS warnings for a new pilot mean WAIT or RELOCATE.SAFETY: Never forget how dangerous these machines are. 3 pounds with spinning blades plummeting from 400 feet is a deadly weapon. Don&rsquo;t fly over people or roads. Warn folks nearby to be aware of the drone. A drone, under the right set of circumstances with a simple malfunction could kill a pet or a human. It&rsquo;s like owning a gun, be responsible or don&rsquo;t own it. Never do like these YouTube folks and fly it miles away to see how far it can go or push the limits to see how fast you can swoop over a crowd of people. That is inviting disaster.THE MIDDLING - should the worst happen with the Standard, and you make a fatal flying error - more likely when a new pilot – then you are out only $400 or so max, instead of a grand, and actually less if you sell the remaining controller and battery etc. on eBay. Every piece of a DJI is worth money and easy to sell, so pick up the pieces if you can. If you can find your crashed drone DJI may fix it under warranty if it was the drone&rsquo;s fault, but don&rsquo;t count on it. DJI at this point in time has horrible support, if that changes, it would be wonderful. I would buy a 3rd party crash warranty over DJI&rsquo;s coverage any day of the week, if that is important to you. They are sold here on Amazon BTW&hellip;NICE PART: Battery lasts longest of all the DJI P3 models in the Standard version by 2 - 3 minutes because of fewer sensors. If you step up to a P3 Pro - batteries and case can come along (But not P4) and at $100 plus per battery, that is good news. Eventually you will want 3 or 4 batteries so you can fly about hour with juice to spare for landings, trust me.BOTTOM LINE: Most of the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; I listed applies to any drone, from $49 to $5000. You can watch at least 3 videos on YouTube of folks crashing $3000 DJI Vision Drones on their very first flight, despite the Vision having much more tech and more sensors and collision avoidance. Sensors or not, if you tell it to go into a wall because you are disoriented and unfamiliar with the controls, it&rsquo;s going to do what you say. This sad story happens every day. This is why I don&rsquo;t encourage a new drone pilot to drop a grand or more on a first drone. Fly a while first and you will never get that disorientation that can cost you a fortune. Instead you will understand the controls and the principles and react instinctively to the inevitable unexpected situation. In my opinion at this time, most any drone any cheaper or similarly priced as this is not a &ldquo;real&rdquo; drone, so you can&rsquo;t take as many of the skills with you when you step up. Many drones in this price range have nothing better to step into. Once you learn to fly a DJI and get familiar with their software and controllers - you can fly their whole line pretty much. I haven&rsquo;t yet mentioned the excellent camera that makes me often joke &ldquo;for the price of a GoPro, I got a comparable camera with a stabilizing gimbal that flies.&rdquo; Put all this together and that is why, in my opinion, this is the BEST DEAL in drones right now - by far&hellip;If this review was helpful to you, it is much appreciated if you would [&hellip;]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I did a LOT of research when deciding on what drone to buy. I ended up going with the Phantom 3 Standard due to US government regulations: you can&rsquo;t fly more than 400 feet in the air or make your drone beyond your line of sight, which made it unnecessary for me to buy a super high-end drone if I couldn&rsquo;t use it to its full extent. So I just needed something with a decent camera and a good control.My Phantom 3 arrived on time. You can detach the quadcopter&rsquo;s battery from the quadcopter and charge it separately. Meanwhile, the controller also needs to be charged. You stick your smartphone in a clamp at the top of the controller the way you may put it in a holder on the top of your car dashboard for map directions.The quadcopter comes with stickers so you can replace the red bands. At first I didn&rsquo;t know how to use it so I wasted my bands by putting them on top of the red ones, not realizing I could remove the red bands first. I ruined my pink bands that way :(Some random facts for people who have never owned a drone:-You can&rsquo;t use these to spy on people because they&rsquo;re loud. Not leaf-blower loud (thank goodness), but hair dryer loud. A lot of people who don&rsquo;t own drones talk about using them to spy on people so that&rsquo;s why I brought it up.-You do have to register your drone, but it was 5 bucks and the registration lasts 3 years so I wasn&rsquo;t bothered.-It is fairy light. The weight of a filled coke bottle or so. When I carry it around I can stick my arm through the leg handles as if it were a weird plastic handbag.As for flight, the quadcopter has its own SSID when you turn it on. You go into your phone, connect to the SSID, and that connects your phone to the quadcopter. You go into the DJI GO app and you will see a livestream through the app.Now, nothing can be poking your camera. That means a completely flat surface, not grass, because the grass will keep the camera from turning which then means the drone automatically will not fly. It took me a while to figure that out. That can be annoying when you&rsquo;re testing it out in a park so I wish there were a way to override that and say go ahead and fly anyway (or maybe there already is? I have my drone on beginner mode).Flying is automatic. You drag your finger across a bar on the screen and the Phantom 3 rises on its own. Landing is the same way&ndash;your drone can be a few hundred feet in the air and you just have to slide your finger across the screen and it descends slowly and carefully. In that sense it&rsquo;s idiot-proof, although once I flew the drone into a wall on a windy day so it&rsquo;s not completely idiot-proof, heh. Nothing broke but the propellers got a little scratched up, there&rsquo;s a black smudge that I can&rsquo;t get rid of no matter how hard I rub with soapy wet cloth.The battery lasted me maybe up to 30 minutes but it starts shutting down at around 30%. I get a good 20 minutes of flight out of it though. I find myself staring at the phone&rsquo;s live feed. The live feed lets you either take pictures or start recording a video, so I like to fly up and then slowly turn the drone with the video recording on. I don&rsquo;t know whether I can include sound, as all my videos have been silent, but there are a lot of features so maybe I haven&rsquo;t discovered it yet. Best of all the live feed measures the height and distance from the controller you are holding: that way you can see whether your drone is 100, 200, 300 feet in the air and you don&rsquo;t break government regulations. I don&rsquo;t dare fly above 200 because I&rsquo;m paranoid it will stop receiving signals from my controller.You can also put a radius limit so that if you try to take your Phantom 3 beyond that distance it will not go any further. If you keep trying to make it go beyond that point it will simply hover in place. Great protection for a newbie like me.Now, the wind can screw things up for you because the Phantom 3 is fairly light. The wind once blew my Phantom 3 into a wall, another time into a bush. Thankfully both accidents happened pretty low so then Phantom 3 fell only a few feet. The actual quadcopter is fine, only the propellers are a bit scratched up.Overall it&rsquo;s an excellent product, I just wish I lived somewhere where I have more excuses to use it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome drone for the money. I am already off the Phantom line and on to the Inspire Pro. But the Phantom 3 Standard is a great value to get you started off. The Standard is all you need to get started. Once you get into it, you&rsquo;re gonna want a better drone. I went with the Inspire 1 Pro and love it. But the Phantom 3 got me there. 2 of my friends have the professional and have remorse for buying them as they want to upgrade now but have to much invested in their drones. All I can say is if drones are new to you, grab a $50 quad and see if it sparks your interest. If so, grab the Phantom 3 Standard. You can have a lot of fun with it and also make some easy money by doing aerial pictures and videos for real estate, farmers, etc. One of the reasons I moved up to the Inspire line. I am doing a lot of work as well as flying it for pleasure. I&rsquo;ve made my money back and then some. Again don&rsquo;t waste your hard earned money on the advanced and professional or even the Phantom 4. Grab the Standard because you will want to upgrade down the road. I still fly my Phantom. I love the drone and don&rsquo;t see myself getting rid of it.NOTE&mdash; Buy the Litchi App for the Phantom. Makes it a lot easier and gives you many more options!</p>
