<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="quite-good-made">Quite good made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first jumping rope that I&rsquo;ve owned, and I have to say that I&rsquo;m impressed with its form and function. I didn&rsquo;t quite know what to expect for the weight and size proportions and am genuinely pleased with each. The whole assembly is quite compact and functions much better than the previous vinyl, cloth, leather and plastic ropes that I&rsquo;ve owned over the years. The bearings in the handle provide a very smooth action and the rope/cable don&rsquo;t seem to suffer the memory issues I&rsquo;ve experienced with vinyl ropes. The rope performs well and the extra accessories included ( cable, ends and bolt/nut assembly) are a great addition and should have the bases covered in the event there are issues with any of those parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-quality-jumprope">Amazing Quality JumpRope!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was Suprised at the great quality of this jumprope! It arrived very fast and was packaged nicely. It comes with a nylon carrying pouch, extra (heavy weight) cord, and extra screws, nuts &amp; rubber caps. It also came with an instruction manual, which I followed to cut and customize the cord to my height. You can loosen the screws on the handles and pull the cord through to shorten it. Also, with the included caps, you can cut off the excess cord and simply put the caps over the ends. I love that it&rsquo;s adjustable. I use this jumprope for exercising and it&rsquo;s amazing! Really great quality cords and jumping with this rope is smooth and easy. I highly recommend this product!</p>

<h5 id="didn-t-expect-to-be-this-great">Didn&rsquo;t expect to be this great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to Star by saying that I think my mother is having more fun using this than anyone else.It&rsquo;s not you common jump rope. It seems more durable, I guess more professional for someone that wants to use it to work out.The handles are comfortable when using it for a long period of time.I love that it comes with extra everything plus a bag to carry the jump rope.It&rsquo;s easy to use, it&rsquo;s fun to use and really feels high quality.If this review please click yes and if you have any questions comment down below.Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="it-s-great-and-more-fun-to-jump-rope-again">It&rsquo;s great and more fun to jump rope again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my speed jump rope more than I imagined. It&rsquo;s so easy to use and so nice and lightweight and it comes with two cables, extra screws and nuts and rubber caps. It took getting use to rather quickly and made me realize after so many years how much I enjoyed jumping rope. I need to exercise but nothing to hard because of physical conditions but this I can do and it is perfect for me. It&rsquo;s pretty impressive haven&rsquo;t seen anything like it before and so when I saw it I had to have it plus I&rsquo;m one of those people that have to be the first one to get new things. It comes with a handy pouch and everything fits in it and small enough to store anywhere you want to. It is very adjustable for whatever height you need and the handles are comfortable and easy to hold. It definitely will help me lose weight and it&rsquo;s kinda fun too and it goes fast but so smoothly. A great price and very durable which is a plus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adjustable-jump-rope">Adjustable jump rope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok I really enjoy and like this jump rope. First of all it is adjustable to your height. Second of all it comes with the little bag that once you&rsquo;re done you can roll it up and slide it back into for safe keeping. It is also very thin wired and has very nice handles which makes it very easy to hold onto while you&rsquo;re jumping. It also comes with an extra rope for when you wear this one out or need a diffetent length maybe I amber unraveled it to really see but regardless hoe freaking cool is that to come with a spare rope? That is a genius idea that made me very impressed and I give this rope a two thumbs up you&rsquo;ll love it if you like jumping rope</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="much-nicer-then-the-jump-rope-i-used-to-own">Much nicer then the jump rope I used to own.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This jump rope is very nice. My old one feels like a toy compared to this. It&rsquo;s adjustable and very fast. I was able to set it at just the right length for me so I found it much easier then the standard length one I had which was honestly about a foot too long. I would have never thought that made a difference but I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a better workout while it actually being easier to jump. I can already notice a difference in the speed I&rsquo;m jumping and I know I&rsquo;m gonna be going even faster with more use and practice. This feels like a real piece of equipment and not a kids toy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality product. This is not ordinary jump rope from your childhood. This is a perfect for training and getting into shape. The jump rope was very light and easy to adjust. One of the best features was the ability to adjust the size of this rope. This makes it convenient with sharing with others. The bag was an extra feature that makes it easy to store and tote the jump rope around. I don&rsquo;t have much time to workout but this lightweight easy carry device makes it possible to workout when i am out of town or on the road. Impressed with the quality.</p>
