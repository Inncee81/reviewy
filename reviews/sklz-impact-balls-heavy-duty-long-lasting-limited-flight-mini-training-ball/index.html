<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="awesome-product-for-an-excellent-price">Awesome product for an excellent price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is excellent for all ages, in all leagues. I have T-ballers all the way to AAAs, and they love these balls. Here are the pros and cons from all ages:Durability:I have yet to see any practice ball that survive the amount of abuses that these balls went through. We have light hitters, all the way to ball destroyers. Compared to the common plastic training baseballs/wiffle balls, these balls have yet to have a visible dent anywhere. We still have dozens of plastic ball halves, used all sort of glues to bind them for extended usages. However, those went into the recycling bin after a week of usages, freshly brought. For $20 a dozen, these outlast the $8/dozen hands down. We&rsquo;ve already spent over $100 of the cheap plastic, including the heavy duty plastic versions. Should have invested in these first.Impact feedback:Incredible impact feedback. Unlike the light impact like the cheaper plastic, these collapsed, creating a longer period of kinetic transfer from bat to ball, leaving a much great impact feedback of where the bat came into contact with the ball, and how much energy was transferred. Everyone was quite impressed, and shocked the first 50 times they hit the balls. The loudness of the stronger impacts continually put huge smiles on those who know the importance of instant feedback of impacts.Travel distance:The harder you hit, the less the distance the balls traveled. It was quite amusing to see T-ballers and minor league 8-years old slammed the balls, and launched them over 80ft, while the AAs and AAAs greatest impacts, creating thunderous sounds, only manage to launch the balls 30ft out. So, the stronger you hit, the less you will need to run and collect the balls.Impact pain:I can&rsquo;t say the amount of pain of getting hit by these balls are less than the stiffer plastic balls. However, these impact balls don&rsquo;t bounce far away once they hit you, leaving a very little red mark. Stiff plastic balls leave nice dark circle marks, and bounce quite far away from you. No need to travel far to grab these balls if you get hit by them.Colors:Why black? Why dark yellow? I can understand if we&rsquo;re practicing during super sunny day, but, I rather have a nice dark red on bright yellow/orange so we can retrieve them more efficiently. It&rsquo;s so hard to find them in the bushes, tall grasses, and the shadowy areas if the balls&rsquo; yellow surface is on the bottom. Took us a good long while to retrieve them all because of the color scheme issue.Weight:We, the coaches and pitchers, love the weight of these balls. They&rsquo;re not so light that it became difficult to throw in light wind (8mph), unlike the cheap stiff plastic balls. They&rsquo;re perfect enough to throw in the wind, with the right amount of weight to know the throw will be accurate enough to place them in the strike zone the way you want. I throw both left and right hand, and these make my pitches much, much easier, especially for small 5-years old T-ballers. An ounce heavier should be perfect, even if I have to pay $5 more for the plastic used.Size:Can&rsquo;t complain. Perfect for all pitcher sizes. However, if SKLZ can make these balls into the size of the golf balls, I&rsquo;ll gladly purchase 10 dozens. I want these balls positive attributes at a smaller sizes to train on batting accuracy and honing players&rsquo; focus.Overall impression:Never again will I buy the cheaper stiff plastics, even when they&rsquo;re on sale at $3/dozen. Wish SKLZ can provide better color scheme, heavier balls, and smaller sizes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I simply love these practice balls. My son has been using them for atleast 25 pitches now with out breaking and I will never buy those white wiffle balls again. He use to crack the wiffle balls in the middle around 10-15 pitches in.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-size-ball-to-increase-eye-hand-coordination-for-baseball">Perfect size ball to increase eye hand coordination for baseball &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect size ball to increase eye hand coordination for baseball or softball batting practice. When they learn to hit these little ones it makes it a lot easier to see and hit the regulation size baseballs and softballs. Another plus is they are somewhat limited flight. Very satisfied with this product.</p>

<h5 id="my-daughter-and-i-love-these-balls">My daughter and I love these balls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter and I love these balls! So much better than the old school plastic balls. We&rsquo;ve been using these for several months now, each ball has been hit hundreds of times and no damage yet. We will be buying more!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-a-good-buy-for-a-nearly-impossible-ball-to-break-but-not-as-much-for-the-limited-flight">They are a good buy for a nearly impossible ball to break, but not as much for the limited flight.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not exactly what I was expecting. They are more plastic than rubber, are very light making it necessary to get pretty close to a batter and behave just like a whiffle ball in flight. I wanted something for BP in limited space and these aren&rsquo;t terrible. I used them in the cage with an &ldquo;L&rdquo; screen and could see you taking one off the dome if you&rsquo;re not quick. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, but your team will get a good laugh. I changed my approach with them from straight up BP to a quick reaction batting drill. The ball curves, but the value in teaching a player to hit a curve is limited because they can&rsquo;t pick up the real spin or action of a real curve ball. Instead, use them to get a kid bailing to stay in, improve hand speed or have fun in the yard. There are better &ldquo;limited flight&rdquo; balls out there, but they are going to cost a whole lot more than these do. They&rsquo;re fun to have around, but I don&rsquo;t know if I will miss them when they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-these-balls">I love these balls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these balls. I&rsquo;ve been an advocate of wiffle ball since I was a kid, but the heavy duty bats they make for adults shred typical plastic balls. These hold up. They are fun to use, and it is interesting that it allows hitters with different power ratings to play each other. The bigger the hitter, the less aerodynamic ability of the ball to go. In other words, it&rsquo;s not how hard you hit it. It&rsquo;s how you hit it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="swing-away-no-worries">Swing away&hellip;&hellip;. no worries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are what you need to practice at home in the back of front yard&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. slam them with all you have and they dont go more than 18 feet. If you want to practice anywhere you can swing a bat&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. these are what you need !!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-great-for-a-younger-kid-learning-the-art-of-hitting">This is great for a younger kid learning the art of hitting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great for a younger kid learning the art of hitting. My 7 year old loves hitting these off the tee and via soft-toss. Please note though that these balls are extremely light and cushy. So, they do not give a real-feel of hitting a softball. It&rsquo;s more similar to hitting a wiffle ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great product</p>

<h5 id="coaches-must-have">Coaches Must Have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good for practicing. Last longer than some other ones.</p>

<h5 id="ho-hum">ho Hum</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These don&rsquo;t hold a candle to the Ripken hard plastic balls that you can&rsquo;t get anymore. It&rsquo;s hard to throw a strike and the trajectory ofthe ball is rther unreliable.</p>
