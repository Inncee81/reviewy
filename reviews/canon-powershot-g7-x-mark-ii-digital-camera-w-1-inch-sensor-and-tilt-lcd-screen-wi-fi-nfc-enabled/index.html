1.0-inch, 20.1 Megapixel* CMOS Sensor
The PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera features a large 1.0-inch, 20.1 Megapixel* CMOS sensor that helps capture high-quality images and videos. Its wide dynamic range helps ensure both bright and dark parts of an image are fully captured, like the shadowy side of a building on a bright sunny day, or streetlights on a dark night. 20.1 Megapixels* means photos with enough detail to print, or enjoy on high-resolution monitors and mobile devices. It also gives additional flexibility during editing, giving you the option of cropping in on your subject for improved composition while still having a detailed, high-resolution image. Smooth gradations from light to dark keeps unrealistic banding in solid colors to a minimum. Thanks to an available ISO of up to 12800 (expandable to 25600) and the power of the new DIGIC 7 Image Processor, extremely low-light photos and videos are possible, with minimal image noise. Using a high ISO also allows for a faster shutter speed, which lowers the possibility of blur caused by excessive hand-held camera shake. For added flexibility, both JPEG and RAW images can be captured and saved.</p>

DIGIC 7 Image Processor
The new DIGIC 7 Image Processor’s enhanced tracking and detection capabilities help keep subjects in focus, while ensuring each image has a high level of sharpness and minimum picture noise. Whether you’re capturing a fast-moving athlete or a feisty puppy, the DIGIC 7 Image Processor in the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera can stay locked on throughout the action. Improved face tracking helps keep your friend or family member the subject of the photo. Even in extreme cases, like in low saturation or low-light dusk, dawn or darkened interior moments, the DIGIC 7 Image Processor helps keep what you’re photographing in focus. It also features the new Dual Sensing IS, which uses data from the image itself to help minimize the blur caused by camera shake and body movement. This results in clear, precise pictures even at slow shutter speeds. All this is in addition to upgraded detail and noise reduction abilities, especially in low light with high ISO settings. Powerful all around, the DIGIC 7 Image Processor helps ensure your photos and videos look sharp and lifelike with minimal unwanted noise or grain.</p>

<p>Canon HS System
The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 7 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with outstanding clarity and detail.</p>

<p>Features a bright f/1.8 (W) – f/2.8 (T), 4.2x (24–100mm), 9-blade iris diaphragm and IS-equipped lens.</p>

<p>4.2x, f/1.8 (W) – f/2.8 (T) Optical Zoom Lens (24–100mm)
The remarkable lens on the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera takes full advantage of the camera&rsquo;s large sensor, giving your photography a wide range of expression. With a bright aperture value of f/1.8 at the wide angle and f/2.8 when fully zoomed to a factor of 4.2x (24mm–100mm), this lens not only puts more in your frame, but is equipped to capture an incredible variety of situations with artistry and precision. Equipped with a 9-blade iris diaphragm, the lens lets you achieve a beautiful background defocus with shapes that are nearly round. Capture macro shots from as close as 2.0 in. (telephoto at 1.3 ft.). From a design perspective, each of the 11 glass lenses on the PowerShot G7 X Mark II has a multi-layer coating on it, which is similar to the Super Spectra Coating technology developed by Canon for EF lenses. These coatings have features like a high transmission factor, ultraviolet protection, resistant surface hardness, and stable characteristics. The coating also maximizes suppression of unwanted reflected light from ghosting or flaring to deliver clear images with high image quality.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
Equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera helps you capture clear, steady images – even in low light without using a tripod. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the Image Stabilizer is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Capture impressively high-resolution images with high-speed continuous shooting up to 8 fps in RAW mode<em>, JPEG mode and RAW+JPEG mode</em>.
When the action happens fast, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera can move fast with it. With the ability to shoot continuously at up to 8 fps, it can help you capture incredible images with nearly no time wasted. Whether you’re trying to catch the moment a player hits a ball, a bird taking flight or the start of any special moment, you can be sure you can capture the photo you want. Offering the flexibility to suit your specific needs, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II can shoot continuously in RAW mode<em>, JPEG mode and RAW+JPEG mode</em>. When used with the camera’s built-in RAW conversion, it provides extensive adjustment options for the images you capture.</p>

<p>Multi-angle capacitive 3.0&rdquo; touch panel LCD with a screen resolution of 1.04 million dots and tilt option of 180° up and 45° down.
The PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera has a large, high-resolution, 3.0&rdquo; LCD monitor that tilts up 180° and down 45°, ideal for composing not only self portraits, but also for taking pictures at high and low angles with ease. The multi-angle LCD encourages creative framing because it&rsquo;s easy to achieve a flexible array of camera angles. Capacitive touch-panel operation feels familiar: simply touch to access quick control settings, focus and shutter release right on screen. A resolution of 1.04 million dots makes the virtually glare-free display ultra crisp and clear, so it&rsquo;s easy to compose your shots, choose camera settings and review and share your images.</p>

<p>Capture stunning 1080p Full HD video in MP4 format with stereo sound.
Whether you&rsquo;re creating artistic film clips or capturing special occasions, the advanced video capabilities of the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera can catch them in the quality they deserve. Incredibly realistic 1080p Full HD video is recorded at 60 fps with stereo sound in convenient MP4 format. Video is smooth and richly detailed even when played back on a large-screen HDTV via the camera&rsquo;s HDMI output. The MP4 format&rsquo;s small file size lets you fit more on a single memory card, and makes downloading and sharing quicker and easier. Manual movie mode is also available: adjust Av, Tv, and ISO speed and even select focus points by using the touch panel LCD screen. You can do this either before or during video capture to express your vision your way in a wider variety of situations – all from a compact camera that is easily portable.</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi** and NFC◊ capability allows for easy sharing and transferring of images and videos.
Built-in Wi-Fi** Technology Makes Sharing Quick and Easy
Built-in Wi-Fi technology allows for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends and family.

<p>Built-in NFC◊ (Near Field Communication) Technology
PowerShot digital cameras with built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology provide fast connectivity with a single tap. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android device◊, and the Camera Connect app will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn&rsquo;t been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-equipped device with the Canon Camera Connect app** installed, and a Wi-Fi connection is established – no camera operations required. Even if your camera is off, NFC turns the camera on and establishes the connection (confirming the camera&rsquo;s nickname and privacy settings before the first connection is required).</p>

<p>Remote Shooting with the Camera Connect App**
Remote shooting functions of the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera through your compatible smartphone or tablet have been vastly improved with the Canon Camera Connect app. Now a variety of the camera&rsquo;s expressive capabilities are available to you: use different shooting modes (P, Av, Tv, M, Custom); enjoy multi-aspect shooting and display; choose AF frame modes (single-point/face detection); shoot in continuous shooting mode; and utilize the AF button.

<p>Picture Style function allows superb command of in-camera color, contrast and sharpness.
The Picture Style function, just like on EOS series digital cameras, lets you choose between eight presets that adjust color, contrast and other aspects of the image to help you fine-tune how your picture looks. For example, if you’re taking a photo of a friend, you can use Portrait mode, which keeps the subject in focus while artistically blurring the background for a soft feel. If you’re looking to capture some stunning mountain peaks, you can use Landscape mode, which helps ensure the image is in focus and the colors are vibrant. There are eight styles to choose from, plus you can download additional styles and even create your own with the Picture Style Editor.</p>

<p>In-camera RAW conversion makes it possible to preview modified conditions of images on the camera, without the use of a computer.
The PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera’s powerful in-camera RAW conversion lets you adjust multiple aspects of an image after you capture it, without using a computer. If an image is a little darker than you’d hoped, you can Increase the brightness, or let the Auto Light Optimizer analyze the photo and change the levels accordingly. You can also fine-tune the white balance for a cool or warm look, change the Picture Style and more. When you’re satisfied with the results, switch between the original and adjusted image to check your work, then save the result as a JPEG for later use.</p>

<p>Control ring features a convenient selection lever enabling you to quickly switch between step ring and continuous ring movement.
The versatile control ring is a quick and convenient way to manually adjust photos and navigate camera menus. A selection lever lets you switch between step ring and continuous ring movement. Step ring movement makes changing settings, like switching between Picture Styles, tweaking aperture or modifying shutter speeds, fast and easy. Continuous ring movement lets you smoothly change focus with minimal sound, even while recording movies, so you’re able to decide what part of the image is sharp while on the go.</p>

<p>Time-Lapse Movie helps capture images at set intervals and combines them to create a short movie clip of the footage.
Time-Lapse Movie mode captures an image every few seconds, then combines these multiple images into a single movie. The sun dropping over the horizon, boats navigating a harbor, cars twisting through streets during rush hour can all be compressed in time, while maintaining gorgeous image quality. Movement appears fast, like reality has been accelerated. Intervals of 1- to 30-seconds between photos are available.</p>

<p>Panning allows the camera to lock onto the main subject using IS and automatically adjust the shutter speed for beautiful background blur.
By using a slow shutter speed and Canon’s advanced image stabilization, the PowerShot G7 X Mark II camera’s Panning mode can help you capture fast-moving subjects in an artistic and striking fashion. Athletes, cars, trains and more can be kept in focus while the background is smoothly blurred, creating an intense appearance of motion.</p>

<p>Amazing camera. I&rsquo;m a professional photographer and I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. I also love all the manual controls and the ease-of-use. I shoot weddings on a Canon 5D Mark III and a Canon 6D. In a pinch I could easily use this camera if I needed to.The picture I have attached is a 15 second exposure with my kids running around with solar lights. This shot is un-edited and was shot in raw. The only thing I did with the picture was transfer it via Wi-Fi to my cell phone using the Canon picture app.</p>

<h5 id="nearly-a-perfect-camera-nearly-a-complete-dslr-replacement">Nearly A Perfect Camera. Nearly a Complete DSLR Replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a hobby shooter, but prefer quality and do a lot of YouTube videos. For background, I&rsquo;ve had a variety of different camcorders, point-and-shoots, and DSLRs: Sony RX100 III, Nikon D5300, D3200, Canon Vixia lower end series, Go Pro Silver 4, three-axis gimbals, etc etc. After having tried out all of these cameras over the last 4-5 years, the Canon G7X Mark II is the closest thing I&rsquo;ve seen to the total package. It&rsquo;s lightweight and ultra-portable &ndash; small enough to fit in your jeans pocket &ndash; but packs a tremendous punch, and is loaded with features.The f1.8 aperture is very sharp at 24MM, though I find that the camera likes to default to f/2, and when shooting manual I need to make a slight adjustment if I want the 1.8. Autofocus is fantastic; virtually seamless in most settings. In low light it takes a second. I also found when trying to manually focus two objects about 2 feet apart on a table (a cup and a candle) that it struggled to focus on the foreground item (hunting) until I corrected by hand.As far as the image quality goes on this guy, it&rsquo;s tremendous, and if you spend some time learning how to use it, it will replicate a Nikon 5xxx or Canon t series very well, without the bother of a bunch of different lenses. Night shooting is great, and it&rsquo;s very easy to do timelapses and get quality images of the night sky.The 24-100mm (35mm equivalent) zoom range is fantastic, and you really don&rsquo;t notice the camera stopping down from 1.8 to 2.8 across the zoom. The digital zoom (beyond the 4.2 optical) is also fairly usable for at least the first little bit, though at full digital zoom it is very grainy.Noise comes in around 1600 ISO, but you can adjust some other settings to deal with that; really you&rsquo;re probably good for most everything until around 2000 ISO.Other Pros:- Fantastic touch screen that&rsquo;s very responsive. I haven&rsquo;t owned many past cameras that use a touch screen for so many settings, but this guy is able to deal with most everything right on the screen.- The swivel screen is nice, and I&rsquo;ve found myself using the downward tilt for high shots more than I expected.- Very simple wifi connection to your phone or computer makes getting shots on instagram (or wherever) a breeze.- Though others have complained about hearing the autofocus sound during video recording, I have not heard it yet. Unless you&rsquo;re in dead silence and need the sound off the camera, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d ever be a problem.- An incredible amount of presets for multiple shooting situations make it so the novice will not need to fiddle with manual settings much (if ever).- The low light performance on this camera is absurdly good. I&rsquo;m frankly not sure how they do it. I was sitting in a chair in my living room in what was nearly pitch black, and the camera was able to light the shot to the point that it looked like the room was fully lit. No noise. It&rsquo;s bizarre (and awesome!) how good this thing shoots in low light.- The weight. So much power in a package you can bring with you just about anywhere.- Unlike the first edition, with the Mark II you can shoot in the &ldquo;film quality&rdquo; 24p, which I tend to enjoy.Other Cons:- The bokeh is good on this camera for the most part, getting very high quality bokeh/background blur if your foreground and background images are 6 or more feet apart. If you&rsquo;re trying to distinguish between two items closer together, it still works well until about 2 feet apart, but the bokeh is not as creamy or DSLR quality. Within 2 feet, it&rsquo;s hit-or-miss.- The battery is simply not capable of supporting what this camera can do. They probably needed a battery twice its size, so buy at least one extra battery.- I might be doing something wrong, but have so far only been able to set the lens ring to adjust aperture or shutter speed. It will not adjust zoom or manual focus as I thought I&rsquo;d be able to do.- The touchscreen manual focus is nice, but trying to adjust it without touch focusing is very cumbersome.- No 4K, but I don&rsquo;t find that to be a huge negative honestly.&mdash;Overall, this thing is a beast, and with just a few more tweaks could probably become a full DSLR replacement for just about everyone except full-time professional photographers. If you&rsquo;re doing anything up to and including serious, routine videography, this thing has horsepower and built-in capabilities to do the job. I&rsquo;ll be selling my NIkon D5300 and accompanying lenses and using this as a full-time shooter for a while. I&rsquo;ve yet to find any deal-breaking limitation.Finally, I bought this off Amazon, because it seems to be backordered everywhere. If you have an eBay account, I got mine from &ldquo;Red Tag Camera&rdquo;, who shipped and delivered to me in two days. They still had six in stock as of Tuesday, so you might want to check there if you want one soon.</p>

<h5 id="impressive-follow-up-to-the-g7x">Impressive follow-up to the G7X</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The G7X Mark II, though not without flaws, is an excellent enthusiast compact. There have been some notable improvements over its predecessor.IMAGE QUALITY: Overall, very impressed with the exception of the Automatic White Balance. It seems to create a blue cast which is exacerbated by the flatter and less constrasty picture profiles. If you can live with manually setting the white balance, this camera creates excellent, sharp, colorful photos. Default JPEG noise reduction is a bit heavy-handed as well, but if you just set it to low you&rsquo;ll get much better results. You&rsquo;ll especially get excellent results from this camera is you utilize the in-camera raw processing tool, which is great. ISO performance is about the same as its predecessor. Even though the lens is the same as before, it seems as if Canon quietly made some improvements to it overall as its more consistently sharp throughout its range. It doesn&rsquo;t quite rise to the level of the lens on the RX100 series cameras but it&rsquo;s still plenty sharp and plus with the G7X Mark II you get the extra 30mm on the telephoto end, which is useful.PERFORMANCE: Autofocus performance has improved over its predecessor although it isn&rsquo;t what I would call lightning fast. Even though the camera touts improved burst performance, especially in RAW, this is not a camera I would rely on for action shooting. Shot to shot times are good and the camera starts up fast. One thing that has to be mentioned is the significant improvement in battery life. While it doesn&rsquo;t even come close to most DSLR, that fact that Canon could take the same small battery and give it noticeably better battery life is commendable.BODY/ERGONOMICS/BUTTONS/CONTROLS: Overall I like most of the changes to the camera&rsquo;s overall design. The more pronounced grip up front is nice. I like that the LCD is more flexible than before which makes composing shots easier in bright, sunny conditions. I also like that you can switch the lens ring in the front to silent, that is a nice touch. The only thing I find irritating is that the ridged part on top of the LCD tends to collect dust and other particles very easily. And speaking of that, this lens, like other 1&rdquo; compacts, is very susceptible to getting dust/particles inside the lens. High recommend that you buy and extra lens cap in order to limit that from happening. I wish Canon would consider sealing the lens a little better on future models to counteract this issue.MENUS/WI-FI: The camera has a more EOS style menu system but overall the layout is pretty typical Canon. One thing that I like is the expanded picture style menu to include the new Fine Detail mode borrowed from the 80D. That does make a difference in JPEGs. As mentioned before, the in camera raw processing tool is great. You have all the parameters to adjust that you need and full access to the picture style menu. WIFI connectivity is very easy. The Canon camera connect app picked up the camera right away and transfer was quick.MOVIE MODE: Excellent video quality. Autofocus is not bad but did hunt just a little during a test video I shot with it.The $679.99 may seem like a pretty steep price to pay, you are getting a lot of camera for your money here. As long as you&rsquo;re ok with a maximum lens reach of 100mm, this makes a great alternative for a hobbyist who is considering a Canon Rebel but does not want the size/bulk and really won&rsquo;t venture much beyond the kit lens. It has a few flaws but overall, it&rsquo;s a great camera.</p>
