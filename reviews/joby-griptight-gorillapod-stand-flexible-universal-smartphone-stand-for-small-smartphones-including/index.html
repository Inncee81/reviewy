<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fake-joby-product">Fake Joby Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I waited a month for this to be shipped from China. It is NOT a Joby product only a very very cheap knock-off at lest thats what came to me. I bought the same tripod that is a real Joby GorillaPod from Walmart about 2 years ago and it says Joby on the release button at the top. This one does not say Joby anywhere or have any markings on it. The 1st ball joint above the 3-way mount the legs attach to is so lose my iPhone 5 falls over and it is about 10% smaller than my real Joby ball joint. The real Joby has a locking ring (gray rubber) on the top ball joint with has a lock/not locked logos. There is stress cracks in almost every ball joint from when they snaped them together. One ball joint has the tighten plastic for the joint coming out where it did not install properly. I ordered this combo set mainly for the GripTight holder which does not say Joby on it and it is very cheaply made too. I&rsquo;m throwing the tripod in the trash and use the GripTight til it breaks which can&rsquo;t be long! Please see picture attached!!</p>

<h5 id="fits-galaxy-note-3-barely">Fits Galaxy Note 3 &hellip; Barely</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recommended for Note 3 users, with a caveat. The GripTight just fits with no protective cover on the phone.I generally use a Finitie Shield series case, only the inner layer, to protect my phablet. With the case in place, the device will not quite fit the grip part of this rig. A thinner skin might be OK. I poked at the rubber on the jaws of &ldquo;clamp&rdquo; in case I could easily pop it out, but it looked like I was going to mangle it so I stopped.I cannot hold it against Joby that their device did not anticipate my application, but I wish the jaws opened one more millimeter!A quick test indicates that the legs have enough grip to support my Note on a vertical pole, which is my application; I use the Note with the CamRanger app to control cameras at the top of an 18&rsquo; pole. Researching ways to attach the phablet to the pole, I arrived at the GripTight rig as a small, light, inexpensive solution. Assume that it&rsquo;s working for me unless I return to update this review with any negative experiences.</p>

<h5 id="great">Great !!</h5>

<p>Using it for an iPhone 6+ and it holds perfect. Works great as a stand and holds steady for photos. Worth every penny.</p>

<h5 id="love-hangin-with-this-gorilla">Love Hangin&rsquo; with this Gorilla!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this thing is really cool! i love how compact and versatile it is. i&rsquo;ve been using it non-stop ever since i got it&hellip; hanging off trees, poles, etc. the pictures are coming out quite nicely. no more shake and out of focus images. i&rsquo;ve also been able to do some cool long exposure photography with new photo apps thanks to this handy little guy. 5-stars!</p>

<h5 id="very-small-an-iphone-6s-will-tremble-after-being-touched-for-a-photo-video-so-prepare-to-remotely-trigger-it-or-use-timer">Very small! An iPhone 6s will &lsquo;tremble&rsquo; after being touched for a photo/video so prepare to &lsquo;remotely&rsquo; trigger it or use timer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very small tripod! I didn&rsquo;t quite realize how small it is! It JUST BARELY fits the iPhone 6s, without a case, or with a very slim fitting case. That is on me for not realizing how small this was - so I have to give it four stars because its not the device&rsquo;s fault that I thought it was &lsquo;something else.&rsquo; The size DOES make it very convenient to carry - I could put this in anything! And the movement of the legs and the &lsquo;pods&rsquo; in the legs is durable and moves great and feels solid. HOWEVER - if you touch the screen of the phone, ie: to trigger video or photo, the phone will vibrate or &lsquo;tremble&rsquo; due to the plastic phone holder. The plastic holder is solid, its just too &lsquo;lightweight&rsquo; and reactive for the job. Expect to &lsquo;remote trigger&rsquo; your photos and videos for a steady shot, or set on a timer. I think I just underestimated the size on this and my needs. I would like to get a larger, taller gorillapod, and I might feel more comfortable with that and it might be a bit more solid - and that&rsquo;s what I would recommend other iPhone 6s owners do (or larger phones,) get the next size up gorillapod. This one is made too top heavy by my iPhone.</p>

<h5 id="generally-sturdy-but-with-a-few-faults">Generally sturdy but with a few faults</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first impression of this GripTight GorillaPod is that&rsquo;s really small, with the total height (including the head) being roughly 6.5&rdquo;. The tripod is extremely light and felt a bit on the cheap side since the legs are made of plastic; but the joints on the individual sections have a decent amount of tension. The top of the tripod features a small quick release mount where you can attach the GripTight mount or most any other smaller smartphone mount for that matter. Just underneath the quick release mount is a ring which you turn to lock the quick release so that you don&rsquo;t accidentally press the button to release the mount. One thing to mention is that after locking everything in place, there is a small amount of play at the quick release mount which may cause noticeable movement if you&rsquo;re doing videos, long exposures, or time-lapses.If you have an iPhone 6 Plus and/or a Reti-Cam mount, they do work on this. I purchased the regular sized mount (not the XL) and if you angle the phone you can get it to fit. I was also able to mount my phone with a very slim (0.4mm) case. In either case, they were an extremely tight fit. I would recommend the XL version if you don&rsquo;t have another mount. If you have the Reti-Cam, rest assured, the GripTight supports the weight of the Reti-Cam mount and iPhone 6 Plus (with slim case). Overall, it seems sturdy enough while gripped onto something until you get to extreme angles, at which point the top quick release joint may tend to sag slightly. If you use it on level ground, it&rsquo;s best to make sure you extend the legs since it can feel top-heavy.Overall, my only complaints are that I wish the top had an actual screw-down lock for the ballhead instead of the round joints since I feel like it&rsquo;ll eventually wear down and become loose. Also, the top quick release mount does show movement when everything is locked down and I would have liked a bit more quality at such an important joint. But honestly, for around $15 it&rsquo;s quite a decent product to have for on-the-go stabilization which is easy to carry around.</p>

<h5 id="great-versatile-little-tripod">Great versatile little tripod</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great versatile little tripod. I got this one in particular because it will supposedly accommodate and iPhone 6 Plus if I decide to upgrade. Be aware that this model does NOT have the magnetic feet like some of the others though. Fairly well made if a possibly a little flimsy feeling. Holds the phone well enough that I feel fine using it but it&rsquo;s not SUPER secure so I would be careful when handling it with the phone in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-not-the-best-for-bigger-iphones">Just not the best for bigger iPhones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty good stand, just not for a plus iPhone. It’s too heavy and the stand can’t hold it upright.</p>
