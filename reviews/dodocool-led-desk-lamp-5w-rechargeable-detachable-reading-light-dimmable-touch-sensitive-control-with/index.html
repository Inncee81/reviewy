<h5 id="don-t-just-use-this-as-a-desk-lamp-this-thing-rocks">Don&rsquo;t just use this as a desk lamp. This thing rocks!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, this lamp is pretty bright. The dimming feature is great- this allows you to use it in different levels of ambient light. I bought a couple more to use a little differently than intended. One for the car. I haven&rsquo;t needed it for myself, but a co-worker was having some car trouble one night, and had a little handheld flashlight that he wanted me to hold while he wrenched a nut. I ran to my trunk, grabbed this thing, and lit up the whole engine bay. Two days later, I passed by his office, and he was showing someone his &ldquo;new emergency light.&rdquo; Seriously, think about getting one for your trunk. With the magnet attached, you get a much wider flood of light than a flashlight, maybe less throw, but you won&rsquo;t take this on a search party.The other way I&rsquo;m using these is as an on-camera fill light. For $16, it&rsquo;s just enough for a lot of the stuff I shoot, and it&rsquo;s nothing in a bag. Weighs nothing if someone has to hold, long battery life/easily recharged, and again, the magnet is great for throwing it up on something, or it can be clamped. Just used one in a c-stand last week- saved my bacon.Whoever makes this thing, make one twice the size (length and diameter). You&rsquo;ll have another winner!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brilliant-in-both-output-and-design">Brilliant in both output and design.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this. Simple design, brilliant light output. I get the tradeoff on plug type. The monoplug is easier to fit without looking than a microUSB at the loss of power cable standardisation. Hopefully I won&rsquo;t have durability issues with the power cable. Love the magnetic attachment to the base which provides lots of options for attaching to metallic surfaces in a pinch. The internal battery power should come in handy during power outages, or evening BBQs outdoors. I&rsquo;d love to see more form factors considered as the notion of a battery backed lamp makes sense in a lot of contexts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-of-the-coolest-desk-lamps-ever">One of the coolest desk lamps, ever&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just needed a portable light to keep on my desk, but this was much more than I expected. First of all, the build quality is excellent. The all aluminum body is easy on the eyes and made very solid. Functionally, you quick touch the tip of the light to turn on/off, and you long touch the tip for dimming. It charges from USB and the light is very bright when turned up. I use it every single day. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-lamp-could-be-a-bit-brighter">Nice little lamp could be a bit brighter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nicely made lamp with small motion sensor near the base of the tube to turn on and control brightness. I was hoping for a brighter lamp but I like the clever design of the lamp. The lamp can be either powered by a special usb (mind you the unit does not come with a plug power adapter) or by it&rsquo;s internal rechargeable battery. Lamp is light weight and could be wall mounted with adhesive strips (two do come with the lamp). Base foot consists of two parts, a fitted plastic adjustable grip holding the tube, and a bracket which has some magnets that hold the grip. This is good for lighting immediate area, but not necessarily a room. A larger, brighter version of this would also be a good sale item. Using these lamps in pairs might be good to light a small room. Instructions are very, very brief. Not sure of exact recharge time or how long the lamp stays on with continuous use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-it">I like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have been using the lamp on my desk at work and I like it quite a bit. The fade on and off effect is nice. Good battery life so far. Ample light output. Love the portability. First impression was that the lamp appeared a little cheaply made - rough cut on the end where the power supply plugins in, could feel with my finger - but functionally I like it. Very versatile the magnetic clip.Side note: I initially expected that the light cylinder would slide into the supplied magnetic holder. Instead I needed to snap the cylinder into the holder. Worked fine.</p>

<h5 id="i-bought-this-thing-on-impulse-because-it-was-on">I bought this thing on impulse because it was on &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this thing on impulse because it was on sale.When it arrived, it was a neat little novelty that laid around.Now we use this versatile thing everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ultra-cool">Ultra cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Loved the design. The only improvement I see is to change the power connector to a standard micro usb. That would avoid the need for a dedicated cable, making it more portable. My toothbrush is already like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-desk-lamp-of-my-dreams">The desk lamp of my dreams &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked up this lamp because it looked cool and I needed something that didn&rsquo;t take up a lot of space on my desk, and alright i&rsquo;ll admit i wanted something that looked like it came from a spaceship. I didn&rsquo;t realize that it had a magnetic base and the light itself could be removed and used elsewhere. The fact that it holds a charge and can get very bright are real perks. I already sent links to friends that also need a small, cool looking, and very versatile lamp.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect portable light. Range of brightness is ideal and the price is great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>ok</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-as-i-don-t-need-to-turn-on-lights-at">Works great as I don&rsquo;t need to turn on lights at &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Using it as a night light next to the bed. Works great as I don&rsquo;t need to turn on lights at night when I wake up to make formula for my baby.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-design-is-very-simple-and-nice-i-got-2">the design is very simple and nice, I got 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>the design is very simple and nice, I got 2, one for my night table and one for my desk, i have noticed that if you don&rsquo;t use them very frequently, the battery last just 30 mins&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. I love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>for 16 bucks this is a fun item - use it like a flashlight</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this LED desk lamp. Very compact but provides plenty of light. The touch control allows you to adjust the light level but keep pressing the top of the lamp.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="computer-work-task-light">Computer work task light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this light. It is bright or dim (use as night light). Lite and easy to release from base (I have used when looking in back of my computer under desk and working on components&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-product">I love this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this product.. this very easy to use, I can control the brightness for the LED and the most useful thing is I can take this lamp anywhere!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-imac-and-any-silver-aluminum-mac-books">Great for IMac and Any Silver Aluminum Mac Books!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have an IMac computer or a Macbook you need this, as it matches the silver aluminum color perfectly!</p>
