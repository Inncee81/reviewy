<blockquote>
<p>We have several Sonicare toothbrushes in my household and every member of my household uses them. I have the much more expensive Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean toothbrush and a few of the inexpensive Sonicare Series 2 toothbrushes. This is a midrange Sonicare toothbrush that has the Sensitive setting and the Clean+White setting as well as the standard Clean setting.Sonicare toothbrushes use ultrasound waves in addition to the brushing action to more effectively break up and remove plaque and it really does work. We&rsquo;ve been using ultrasonic toothbrushes for a number of years now and have the healthy mouths to prove it. And since there is a direct link between gum disease and heart disease, healthy teeth and gums give you more than just a beautiful smile. One of my children and I have defective heart valves and have been cautioned to practice good dental hygiene to avoid gum disease that could lead to a heart valve infection. Our cardiologist recommends ultrasonic cleaning, along with regular dental check ups, so I feel safer having my entire family use Sonicare as their regular toothbrush.If you&rsquo;ve never used a Sonicare toothbrush before, you will notice immediately that it&rsquo;s a very vigorous cleaning. It may even be uncomfortable at first. This Sonicare has an Easy Start mode that gradually increases the power of the brushing action over a two week period to help you get used to it. Easy Start is activated when you first use the toothbrush as long as you do not use the Clean+White setting, which is the most vigorous setting. Additionally, this model has a Sensitive setting for people with sensitive teeth.There is an automatic 2 minute timer to ensure you brush for the full recommended time, which is especially great for kids. It also alerts you every 30 seconds to switch to another quadrant of your mouth so you brush every area thoroughly. The Clean+White setting does the normal 2 minutes of clean mode and then an additional 30 seconds of white mode which prompts you to brush for 15 seconds on your upper, front teeth and then 15 seconds on your lower, front teeth.This model comes with one Plaque Control brush head. The brush heads should be replaced every 3 months, just like a manual toothbrush, and they feature colored bristles that fade to remind you it&rsquo;s time to replace your brush head. Philips offers several styles of brush heads that will fit this toothbrush - Plaque Control, Gum Health, InterCare and Diamond Clean.The Philips brand brush heads are excellent but also pricey. I buy these for my large family, which fit perfectly and perform just as well, IMO.Â Standard Replacement Brush Heads for Philips Sonicare HX6014/13 ProResults (4, 8, 12 or 20 Pack) | Fits: Easyclean, DiamondClean, HealthyWhite, Flexcare [20 Pack]The charging base is very compact - great for limited counter space and for travel. There is a light on the toothbrush that flashes when charging and glows steady when charging is complete. Philips says it has a 3 week battery life, which will depend somewhat on how many people are using it daily. It also comes with a nice, plastic, travel case which holds the toothbrush and two brush heads (but not the charging base.)I do not have sensitive teeth and I love the way it makes my teeth and gums feel. Additionally, it&rsquo;s fabulous for removing coffee and tea stains from your teeth. Plus, I like that one toothbrush can keep a whole family&rsquo;s teeth and gums healthy and all you need is to purchase separate brush heads for everyone. It has a 2 year warranty but in my experience, they last years longer.Tip for larger families: While there are color coded bands available to put around the base of the brush heads to identify whose is whose, I found an easier solution. I found that large medication bottles - ones measuring 3 <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; or taller without the cap on - are the perfect size to hold a brush head. I painted each family member&rsquo;s initial on the bottle with bright nail polish so everyone knows which brush head is theirs and there is no mix up. I got the bottles that have the cap that is childproof when put on one way and non child-proof when turned upside down for convenience and I got them from our veterinarian at no cost. While the brush heads generally come with a clear plastic cap, the caps are small and ours invariably get lost. The bottle method has worked very well for us for quite a few years.I got the lavender color, which is lavender and white in the front and a darker, dusty purple color on the back of the toothbrush. The dusty purple back is textured and has a rubberized finish to make it non-slip in wet hands. This is something I&rsquo;m not as pleased with because in my experience, rubberized surfaces have a tendency to get gummy and sticky after a year or two. I will update this review if that happens.My only other disappointment is that for the price, I wish Philips had included another brush head or two since these are often purchased for families. But this is not a huge issue since you&rsquo;ll be buying replacement heads every 3 months anyway.If you want the Sonicare clean <em>and</em> whitening or if you have sensitive teeth, this is an excellent choice at a midrange price.</p>

<p>I own a variety of Sonicare toothbrushes. Besides the Healthy White, I also own the Flexcare Platinum, the Series 3 and the Series 2. The Healthy White is supposed to sit just between the Flexcare Platinum and the Series 3 in terms of features and price. The most important thing to know about Sonicares is that they all have the same cleaning ability for the given types of brush head. Since everything from the Sonicare 2 all the way up to the Diamondclean can all take the same heads, you can get the same performance from the Sonicare 2 as you can from the most expensive model by switching out the brush heads.Specific to the Healthy White, its feature are that it comes with a case (like the Series 3), and it has 3 different cleaning cycles, and this model is a bit more sleek and stylish than the Series 3. Normal is just like any other brush; sensitive is just a less intense normal cycle, and whitening is just an extra 20 seconds at the end of the standard 2-minute cycle. The drawback to these options on the Healthy White (and the intensity settings of the Series 3) is that it doesn&rsquo;t remember the last cycle. So, if you always want to do sensitive, or always want to do whitening, you have to press the button multiple times every time you brush. Additionally, the whitening setting doesn&rsquo;t make the brush clean any differently other than adding an extra 20 seconds. This can easily be done with any of the lower models just by pressing the button again for some extra time.Here&rsquo;s my summary of what you get for each model:Series 2: All the cleaning ability of any other sonicare. Basic operation with a 2-minute timer, which is divided into four 30-second intervals. Basic battery life and no carry case.Series 3: Add 2 additional intensity settings and a bit of battery life. Comes with a carry case; handle slightly more compact than Series 2.Healthy White: Has low (sensitive) setting, regular setting, plus an option to add 30 seconds to the normal cycle (this is the &ldquo;extra whitening&rdquo; feature). Handle is slightly more compact than series 3.Flexcare Platinum: Has 3 intensity settings plus 3 cycle options (2-minute, 2:30 (same as Healthy White), 3 minute). Upgrades the carry case to a clear cover, adds a brush head holder to the charger, remembers your settings so you only need to push the main button each time you brush, comes with two brush heads instead of one. Has sensor to stop moving if you apply too much pressure against your teeth. Some models also upgrade to a sanitizer or other accessories.DiamondClean: Adds some extra mode options compared to the Flexcare. Sensitive is extra gentle, gum care simply adds 1-minute of lower intensity to brush gums, polish is a 1 minute cycle, and whitening is the 2:30 cycle found on the previous 2 models. Comes with a fancy charging glass and the travel case can be plugged into a usb port and charge the brush. Keep in mind that even the Series 2 has about a 2-week battery life and all the others an average 3-week. So, unless you travel for extended periods AND don&rsquo;t want to take the standard charger with you, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of advantage to these perks.Back to the Healthy White, I see it as kind of a &ldquo;fill-in&rdquo; model to bridge the price gap between the Series 3 and Flexcare Platinum. I personally love the Flexcare because I like the higher intensity and 3-minute setting. Many, if not most people are quite happy with the Series 2 and its simply operation. You can accomplish just about anything with the Series 2 as you can with the other models just by pushing the start button to add some time. Unless you really need the sensitive setting (and assuming it&rsquo;s different than the low setting of the Series 3), there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of advantage to upgrade to the Healthy White other than aesthetics.</p>

<p>This is a really nice option for an electric toothbrush. I had another version of the Sonicare toothbrush, which I really liked, but I ended up switching to another brand because it connected directly to my iPhone. This Sonicare brush is a great transition from a manual toothbrush to an electric one. It&rsquo;s got simple controls and an easy to use charging dock. It comes with a really nice travel case and one brush head. It would be great if a second head was included with the original purchase of the brush, but you can get spares anywhere that the brush is sold. The brush holds a charge for a few days, but I typically store the brush on its charger so a dead brush isn&rsquo;t a problem for me. I think this is a good option for people that want to switch to a powered toothbrush.</p>
