<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m exactly 50 miles in a straight line northwest of the Houston TV transmitting towers and using the exact same antenna for my older Panasonic HDTV, this Samsung UHD television brought in twice as many stations and without any pixel breakup like my 7 year old Panasonic HDTV does. A few of the new stations are the ones that transmit 4 channels on one frequency channel, so I can&rsquo;t really count them in the doubling of stations. It would require some note taking to get the exact number of distinct new stations I&rsquo;ve gained. But I can certainly say I&rsquo;m getting a lot more stations with much clearer solid signals without the pixel breakup on some channels I had previously. And I&rsquo;m using one of those inexpensive $20 to $25 flat amplified antennas lying flat on the top of a chest near a window. So I&rsquo;d say the signal reception of this Samsung UHD television is absolutely exceptional.Of course, all of the television stations are still broadcasting in HD, but the video image is still nothing short of outstanding. My wife and I never even noticed the curved screen while we were watching the news. I wasn&rsquo;t sure I would like a curved screen, but the curve is quite subtle and not overdone like it is on my 27 inch Samsung computer monitor. At first glance, you wouldn&rsquo;t notice this television screen is curved.The audio volume is not very loud, but it is clean sound with no detectable distortion. We run it at full volume and while we can hear it adequately across a large open living area, itâ€™s not very impressive when watching an action movie. I just got a Sony BDPS6700 4K Upscaling receiver with UHD pass-through. I have enough speakers left over from previous upgrades to make a full 5.1 surround system. I already have a Sony Blu-ray player from Amazon with UHD upscaling. I tested the 4K upscaling last night with a recently released movie and while I canâ€™t verbally describe how much the image is improved, the detail is incredible. I would need an identical system side-by-side to assess the upscaling improvement. What I can say is the image is excellent with or without the upscaling.But the real proof came from actual 4K video shot with a Samsung camera that I gave to my daughter. The detail and resolution are just awesome. I almost never use the word awesome, but the video files my daughter sent to me were so incredible, it was the only word suitable to describe the quality. I wish it was possible to show the video to you so you could witness how amazing it is. I copied the files to a Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD with a USB 3.0 cable and it plays directly to a USB hub I put on the high current USB port on the back of the Samsung UHD television set - works perfectly.Sony STRDH550 5.2 Channel 4K AV ReceiverSony BDPS6700 4K Upscaling 3D Streaming Blu-Ray Disc Player (2016 Model)UNITEK Portable USB 3.0 4-Port High Speed Hub with BC 1.2 Charging with 5V 1.2A and Built-in USB 3.0 Cable LED for iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, Chrombook, Surface ProAmplified HDTV Antenna- VIEWTEK Digital Indoor TV Antennas, 50 Mile Range with Detachable Amplifier, 13 Ft Copper Coaxial Cable and USB Power SupplySamsung NX500 28 MP Wireless Smart Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens (Black)Look at the photos of the backside of the UHD television. I have a Solid State Disk with multiple movies on it connected to the top USB port. And on the second USB port that has higher current, I added a four port USB 3.0 hub where I installed micro transceivers for a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse and still have two USB 3.0 ports open for other things. I used the high current USB connector for the USB 3.0 hub I already bought here on Amazon. It appears the wireless keyboard and mouse can only be used when using the internet, but not for setup of the television itself. You still have to use the remote control for everything else. I am so glad to be able to use both a wireless keyboard and mouse with this UHD television.TeckNet Alpha Ergonomic 2.4G Wireless Optical Mobile Mouse with USB Nano Receiver for Laptop,PC,Chromebook,Macbook,Computer,6 Buttons,18 Months Battery Life, 5 DPI Adjustment LevelsHP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2I have been using a very good Panasonic 65 inch Plasma HDTV for 6 years but I plan to replace it during Black Friday week (2017) with a Samsung UHD television preferably with a display larger than 65 inches, hopefully 70 to 80 inches if it isn&rsquo;t overly expensive.This is an excellent UHD television and I believe you will be equally impressed.</p>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great TV! The picture is awesome with pretty much every media put thru it. It does a great job of upscaling old tv and movies. There are a few different modes for the tv to display, standard, natural, movie, etc. On standard mode, it makes everything look &ldquo;live&rdquo;. Tho the picture is still fantastic, I don&rsquo;t care much for it, so a trick is to put it in movie mode (then go into the setup and amp up the sharpness) and it will look more like what you may be used to. I suppose the sound is okay, but if you&rsquo;re not sporting a surround sound system, then you are only getting half the experience anyway. My only complaint would be the remote. While sleek, it&rsquo;s a little too simplistic. Just a few more buttons for for basic playback functions would be nice, rather than selecting FF, RW, Play, etc, from a menu. This becomes an issue if you choose to stream video from the built in apps.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-tv-for-gaming-and-movies-sports">AMAZING TV FOR GAMING AND MOVIES/SPORTS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tv is AMAZING!! It has BEAUTIFUL picture. The sound is ok I would say. Def would recommend a sound bar or surround sound at some point. The HDR picture is AMAZING as well.I originally purchased this tv because I previously had another 55&rdquo; 4k Curved HDR &ldquo;Compatible tv(A lower-End Model. Don&rsquo;t want to say the name. But it&rsquo;s similar to Hair.)Anyways, I have an Xbox One S game console. Which plays 4k and HDR. Unlike the previous versions of the Xbox One&rsquo;s. So because I have the Xbox One S I wanted to be able to completely enjoy it&rsquo;s features. So after setting up my other 4k TV. I get the message STATING that the tv doesn&rsquo;t support HDR 10Bit. Which means that I won&rsquo;t be able to game in HDR. So I was upset.So I did research and decided on this tv. I sold my other one and purchased this one.Now after connecting everything up. Went through my Xbox One to activate the 4k Video output and everything. Then I get a message STATING that my BRAND NEW TV MY SAMSUNG doesn&rsquo;t support HDR 10bit. There for I won&rsquo;t be able to game in HDR. So as you can imagine I was NOT HAPPY.Well after going through some tv settings I realized that you have to Activate/turn on the tv&rsquo;s HDR settings. So I did and went through my Xbox video setup again. THIS TIME Not only did it verify that the tv can do HDR 10Bit and not just the HDR 8bit like my previous tv. But it also supports HDR 12bit.So if you get this tv and are wanting to use the HDR feature. Just keep in mind that you have to manually go into the settings and turn it on.Also anyone wondering about a good 4k/HDR/Blu-Ray player to pair with your TV. I would recommend getting an Xbox One S. Because well a couple reasons. It isn&rsquo;t JUST a gaming console. But it also plays 4k, HDR, Blu-Ray. It&rsquo;s also a media center, it has all kinds of apps you can install from the windows store and so so much more. Because just a standard 4k/HDR Dvd player will cost about the same price if not more.Anyways I realize this is a VERY VERY LONG REVIEW and I apologize. But wanted to express how awesome the tv is, how awesome the video is. Also that it is AMAZING to be used with an Xbox One S.Lastly, the only real negatives I would have really are:1. Audio2. The fact that you have to manually go in and activate the HDR feature3. It only has 3 HDMI ports.4. It doesn&rsquo;t run Android OS for its smart tv stuff.</p>

<p>Out of the box a very easy TV to set up and have working in minutes with Comcast/Xfinity cable. ONE remote works &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; good but does not seam to recognize sound bar for volume changes. Does not have numbers on remote to change EASY to a channel this way but does have guild, once selected channel pops up fast.Picture Quality is outstanding, Replaced a 45&rdquo; Samsung flat with this one and quality in WOW! 49&rdquo; even for our large open living area is almost tooooo big. Very pleased with purchase.</p>

<h5 id="works-as-a-monitor">Works as a monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this TV to use as a PC monitor. It performs wonderfully at this task. The text in PC mode is clear and sharp. Games look amazing with 4k@60hz. The response time is a little higher than a quality monitor, but it isn&rsquo;t particularly noticeable. All in all I am very pleased with the way it looks.</p>
