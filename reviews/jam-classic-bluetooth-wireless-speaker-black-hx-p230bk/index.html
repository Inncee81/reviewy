<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="don-t-be-fooled-by-the-small-package">Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the small package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, I would like to explain that this may be an ongoing review. I just bought this item last night, and being a person who understands electronics, I usually wait for my reviews. This time, I figured I would start the review, and then I can come back and edit. Therefore, you may see some updates or changes below.Second, don&rsquo;t let my initial 4-star rating fool you. I was torn on how to rate this product for the value of what you pay, or vs. other speakers. I decided to put this up against much larger bluetooth speakers, and I think it speaks volumes that a $40 item is 4-stars compared to $150 bluetooth portable speakers.I&rsquo;m going to start with what most peopls call &ldquo;cons&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m just going to note them as minor nuisances-The cord is only about 6 inches long&hellip;.BUT&hellip;its your standard android type charger. Since I&rsquo;m a Samsung Galaxy boy, myself, I have a ton of these cables. It is currently charging with an old LG cable I found-Some have mentioned a slight hum in the speaker. This is pretty common with most Bluetooth devices. This goes away when you start playing music. There have been some that said, &ldquo;once you hear the hum, you always hear the hum&rdquo;. I purposely turned the music all the way down just to hear the hum. I listened to it at my desk for 5 minutes, and then played music again. I don&rsquo;t notice any hum, and I am TRYING to hear it. So, although there is, in fact, a hum, I&rsquo;m not noticing it when in use.-Its not a great bass machine, but again, is this really a con? Do people buy a prius to drag-race? Cannot really hold that against this machine, so again&hellip;that is why I said a &ldquo;minor nuisance&rdquo; (and that is a stretch)-The power switch is on the bottom-There is an extreeeeeemly loud series of beeps every time you turn it on. You know its coming, so you can try to shield it. Its still somewhat annoying, and not good for starting up in quiet places. There may be a way around this, I just haven not figured it out.-The controls on the speaker itself are a little slow to respond, but honestly, who is going to use this? It is only a minor delay anyway. I just tested them to see what they were. I control everything from my phone.I tried this thing out approximately 10 times in Bed Bath and Beyond. I kept messing with their display and was rather disappointed that I couldn not try my own music on their display. So, that kept me from trying it at first. Plus, I am always concerned that the display model is set up differently and it just won&rsquo;t sound as good at home in larger rooms&hellip;which takes me to my pros, and what I love about this (so far)-The sound fills a room. Its not that massive BOSE sound, but its pretty close in how it fills a room. I listen to a lot of 90&rsquo;s acoustic rock and that stuff sounds incredible. Now, if you get to some of the newer club-rap type of music, there is not a lot of power, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound distorted either. Still sounds good, it just is not going to blow your hair back and rattle windows-I had the phone about 15 feet away from the device and it played beautifully. What is funny is Pandora played clearer than my recorded music&hellip;here is why that is a pro. Because, I realized a lot of my recorded music is garbage from the internet and typically poor recordings, which leads me to believe that this device really picks out the clarity of songs. Much like a good set of headphones might actually make some of my bad recording actually sound bad because the headphones are so clear.-The construction is very sturdy- (pending a battery test)- any standard charger that comes with most android phones can charge this.-line in that will work with non-USB devices-packaging is actually very nice. I will keep this for storage.If you are skeptical about buying this, just buy it from a place that has easy returns. Thus far, I have no desire to return it. As far as performance goes, it is a solid 5-star product for the price. Again, I gave it four stars only because its slightly not as powerful as some bigger, more expensive speakers. I realize that may not be a fair assessment, but, again, I think it speaks more to the product that I give it 4 stars in comparing it to the larger portable Bluetooth speakers. I think the only way I would have a problem with this speaker in the future, is if for some reason performance decreases, or I find that the battery lasts a very short amount of time. I will update this, if needed, in the future. If you don&rsquo;t hear from me, that means its still doing well :)</p>

<h5 id="works-well-with-my-new-girlfriend-alexa">Works well with my new girlfriend Alexa.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well with Alexa. Not the greatest Bluetooth speaker, but it has enough punch to use at the beach and around the pool. I have had on for years and usually get about 3 or 4 good hours before having to recharge. I always connected it to my phone and enjoyed sound where ever we were.I recently got an Echo Dot and found an even better use for the little JAM speaker so I ordered another one. I can leave this plugged in and it stays connect to the Dot constantly. It doesn&rsquo;t have the best bass, but we have enjoyed telling Alexa to play Christmas music and listening through it. If I want to go sit in another room or go to the basement to work I can just grab the speaker and take it with me. I have a 3800 square foot house over three levels and this thing works everywhere in the house with the exception of one bathroom upstairs on the farthest corner of the house. The echo is on other side of the house so I wasn&rsquo;t really surprised.For the sounds, range and battery life you can&rsquo;t really go wrong as inexpensive as this thing are. I bought the first on because we were using it around water and I didn&rsquo;t want to be too upset if it got wet and messed up. Works well with Echo and doesn&rsquo;t disconnect as long as you leave it plugged in to charge.</p>

<h5 id="it-was-a-good-one-before-but-now-it-became-below-average-compact-bt-speaker-tinny-and-hollow-sound-without-tight-bass">It was a good one before, but now, it became below average compact BT speaker. Tinny and hollow sound without tight bass.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is the one of the earliest and most popular BT speakers of all time. When BT speakers first came out many years ago, this JAM BT speakers ruled the world for entry level speakers. I bought couple of them before and they were very good value (well, at that time) and worked very well.Now, of course, there are plethora of BT speakers and very difficult to choose what to buy, specially for small, compact entry level speakers. I travel a lot and I needed a small BT speaker that does not break my wallet. So, I decided to give it a try once more. I believe that last time i bought this for myself was about four years ago. Now four years fast forward, the price has come down about $15.00.Since i have tried out and owned a lot of smaller and entry types of BT speakers, I had a pretty good idea how this should sound to be competitive against the other compact speakers out on the market. Everything worked good. it looked sharp and I just loved the deep red color and had no trouble connecting with my phone and computer. After listening for a while and comparing with other similar price range speakers, I have realized that JAM has not made the improvement on the sound quality of this BT speaker. Bit hollow and tinny sound signature without tight bass.It WAS a very good BT speaker 4 years ago, but technology of BT has improved tremendously and Jam has left behind.There are many other speakers that has better sound, longer battery life, even with smaller foot print. So, I decided to return and give others a try.</p>

<h5 id="great-speaker-but-weak-battery-life-then-zero-battery-life-in-less-than-one-year">Great speaker but weak battery life - then ZERO battery life in less than one year.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the sound quality. Love the size. I am not in love with the longevity of the battery however. I have never been able to get the battery to last more than a few hours. To ensure that I have speaker capability I keep it plugged up using a charger cord the entire time I am using it. If the battery lasted longer - say 10 hours, I would have no issues with putting 5-stars on this item. I use 10 hours as the mark because other speakers I have either owned or know people who own them say they get 10 hours out of their speakers.<strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>I bought this speaker on May 25 2014. Today is Apr 12 2015. The speaker will not hold a charge for more than a few minutes. This did not even last a year. Any product that cannot even last a year is not a good product. Even junk Microsoft PC&rsquo;s last a year. As such, I am changing my review rating form 3-stars (because of the poor battery even when it did hold a full charge) to a 1-star because now I must spend more money on a new speaker from a different company.</p>
