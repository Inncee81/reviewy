<h5 id="after-3-month-it-s-going-in-the-trash">After 3 month it&rsquo;s going in the trash</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first got this mat I liked it for the cushiness provided for my knees, but over time the rubber started breaking down. I am a 200 pound male and as you can see by the photo there are handprints and footprints when I&rsquo;ve only used it for five minutes. By the end of a 75 minute yoga session the mat is mushed down and doesn&rsquo;t rebound. I&rsquo;ve had this mat for three months and it&rsquo;s going in the trash.</p>

<h5 id="not-thick-at-all-and-collects-so-much-dust">NOT thick at all and collects so much dust</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this yoga mat for awhile and have had issues with it since maybe the second day. I can&rsquo;t believe I haven&rsquo;t written a review earlier. This is literally the worst yoga mat I have ever used. I stretch a lot, and I can&rsquo;t go into a lunge stretch without the mat getting SO flattened that my knees hurt. I literally step on it and it leaves marks, as you can see from the attached picture. I&rsquo;ve been folding the mat in half to be able to stretch on the mat, which totally defeats the purpose of having a 70&rdquo; mat. I also can&rsquo;t get into the splits on this mat without feeling like the mat is going to tear since it just stretches out so much.This mat also catches SO much dust. I left the mat out one day in my apartment and when I got home, there was so much dust on it and I had a really hard time cleaning it.Not worth the money, I would definitely invest in a different mat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-last">Did not last&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mat is comfortable therefore I am giving it one star.I used it for 2 10 minute sessions for sitting meditation. On day 3 when I rolled it out it had small tears and notches and has now large traveling tears running the length of the mat. I am sorry I purchased this item. Perhaps I received a defective item, though it appeared fine when it arrived. The mat was stored as recommended and has not been put into any extraordinary situation to cause such tears and notches. I have put it away and returned to my old mat which continues to give good service after several years though it does not have the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thickness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mat-bad-packaging">Great mat, bad packaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the mat. It is nice and thick and a few inches longer than the one I previously owned.However, it came to me damaged and the strap it comes with left permanent indentions on the top of the mat which will not go away and looks really bad. On the side there are also a few rips on the edges. I am in need of a mat now and don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of returning it so I will hang onto it and hope it will last me a while. I guess I didn&rsquo;t buy it for a beauty contest anyways.All in all&hellip;a great mat if it was packaged better.I hope this review has been helpful to you. If it has would you please consider clicking the yes button below? I would appreciate it. Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="not-for-the-advanced-practitioner">Not for the advanced practitioner.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately this mat is really impractical for yoga. While I thought it was great at first, the more I used it the more trouble I had with sinking into the mat while am trying to hold long and challenging poses. If you&rsquo;re doing sit ups, it&rsquo;s probably great as it&rsquo;s very very cushiony and feels great. Unfortunately, if you&rsquo;re doing advanced yoga postures that involve concentrated holds and balance, you start to sink into the foam, which can throw you off balance and in my case led to pain in my wrists. It&rsquo;s a shame as I was really excited about how comfortable it was at first, but now find that I just can&rsquo;t balance properly in the most challenging postures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tradeoff-between-comfort-and-balance">Tradeoff between comfort and balance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this yoga mat when I was a newbie. The class that I was attending provided mats, but oh my goodness did they smell awful. Probably never cleaned, and part of the class had us lying face-down on these atrocities. So I bought my own. However, I quickly learned that you can buy a mat which is too thick. Now, this product is advertised as &ldquo;Extra Thick,&rdquo; so this is not a fault of the product. Rather, this is advice to newbies such as myself regarding buying a thick mat:Pro:+ The cushioning is really nice, especially if you&rsquo;re in positions involving your knees on the floor, etc. Much less pain.+ The carrying strap, while simple, works really well.Cons:- The cushioning makes it surprisingly challenging to balance. I would say my one-legged balance is better than average, but I eventually decided to just step off the mat for those moves.- The mat is loud. Strange thing to say, right? Imagine dragging styrofoam across cling wrap. It&rsquo;s sort of like that, except in my case it was a yoga mat on a hardwood floor. The material that makes this mat so thick and squishy also makes it stretchy. So if you do a warrior pose, for example, the force from your splayed legs will stretch the mat across the floor and create very un-yoga-like sounds.Conclusion:Even if you really want that cushioning for added comfort, compromise and get something thinner. You will find that you balance better, and you will develop tolerance to any added knee pain anyway.</p>
