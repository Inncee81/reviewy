<h5 id="some-bad-units-inevitable-but-i-will-buy-this-model-every-time">Some bad units inevitable but I will buy this model every time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had one with some problems which was replaced immediately by the seller (monkey in the name). The kit is perfect has more than you need to swap the display. The tools alone are worth half the price.It costs 2-3 times the price to buy a pre-tested display it would be more cost effective to just buy a spare of this kit and keep or return if the first one works properly.The attitude of &ldquo;it has to work as good as a the $250 fix or I&rsquo;ll give a 1 star review&rdquo; is terrible.I am guilty myself of accidentally breaking an iPad screen while installing because I realized I forgot to screw down the display. I tried to pry up the glass I glued down seconds earlier without hearing it. Bad idea.The last three times I&rsquo;ve replaced an iPad screen I put the entire iPad in my toaster oven and heated to 150F. Hotter than apples official max storage but way lower than the 180F that almost any electronic component is designed to take. (Coincidentally the best way to remove moisture from any electronic device).Keys to this kit being my favorite:Has all the tools neededPerfectly packagedInstant replacement of faulty one from the vendorHas home button and camera frame pre mountedHas adhesive pre mounted.Has protective film both sides (don&rsquo;t forget to remove inside)I was going to rate 4 starts because I did get a bum unit but it was instantly replaced with perfect model so back to 5 stars.</p>

<h5 id="broken-1st-gen-ipad-air-front-glass-this-is-the-one-you-need">Broken 1st Gen iPad Air front glass? This is the one you need!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well there&rsquo;s not much to say here. The digitizer feels nice and sturdy it doesn&rsquo;t feel like some flimsy &ldquo;plasticy&rdquo; feeling glass digitizers I have felt in the past. The ribbon cables lined up nicely, home button was already installed and it was nice and straight, It went on smoothly without any issues.Now that being said, If you have not done a digitizer on an iPad Air I would recommend that you take it to a professional because the way the wires are run you can accidentally tear off one of the antenna wires, wifi cable, or even the speaker cables.I ordered this digitizer while in a pinch because my normal supplier did not have any in stock. And although I do this for a living I would say the quality of the digitizer is as good if not better than most other suppliers I have tried.Don&rsquo;t hesitate, get it if your digitizer is broken,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-100">Works 100%</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was sceptical about buying this part as I am a professional installer and most parts seem to be defective on here as far as digitizers go but this time I didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to try it as my distributors wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get the part to me in time for my customer and was able to get it 2 days quicker here on Amazon and the screen was packaged very good and worked with no problems so I have a happy customer.</p>

<h5 id="so-so-product-maybe-i-got-a-bad-one">So so product&hellip;maybe I got a bad one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(+) This is a complete kit and was relatively easy to install. It came with all the items required to make installation easy. It also included the tools needed for installation. Price was excellent and delivery quick (Prime Member).(-) I have already noticed a pixel has stopped functioning and when using the ipad keyboard the numbers and letters on the left side of the keyboard will often not react to touch unless you hold your finger on them for a lengthy period of time or in the case of the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; you have to touch the right, top quadrant of the key. I probably would not buy this product again. If you are going to the trouble of changing out a display on an ipad it&rsquo;s better if the product you install works right the first time so you do not have to do the installation over again. Not sure if the company would have sent me a replacement if I had asked them to. I decided one installation was enough and did not ask for a replacement. I&rsquo;m living with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-even-better-price">Great buy even better price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked like a charm! Very easy to do as this was my first time replacing a crushed screen on a tablet! You don&rsquo;t need a heat gun as a hair dryer will work just fine to loosen up the glue and the tools provided worked just fine. Everything is here that you need to fix your broke/smashed/chipped screen. Just make sure your LCD panel is not broke (should still light up) and clean it very well before putting the new screen back on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="finally-something-that-actually-works">Finally something that actually works!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tested screen all good. glued button down, button mushy, use original and glue into this one. Strongest tape out of all I&rsquo;ve tried but still not strong enough, had to glue the area were the ribbon cables are so now I dare not swap out the junk button with the factory button.Giving 4 Stars because the button is worse than all the other generics I&rsquo;ve tried. Caveat, rather have this button and a digitizer that works. been working good for a couple days now, no dead spots and no crazy screen. Also the glass isn&rsquo;t as smooth as the factory digitizer glass.If you need to repair, just carefully pop the button it comes with and put the factory button in, Crazy glue works for that. The button that comes with this is very hard to press and spongy. Wish I checked the button before final assembly.Been thru so many digitizes that didn&rsquo;t work right off the bat or worked less than an hour then dead spots and crazy ghost pressing screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="youtube-and-this-screen-success">YouTube and This Screen = Success</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Item came packaged beautifully and ready to go. The tools were very helpful, though I recommend having an x-acto knife, some shipping tape, as well as a real heat gun, esp if your screen is shattered in a million pieces like mine was. YouTube vids were very helpful - watched a couple comprehensive tutorials before receiving the screen and had one playing and pausing while installing. Total novice here &amp; (other than a few smudges on the LCD - don&rsquo;t use alcohol to clean that!!) I feel like it was a success!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-ipad-air-1-perfectly-the-only-downside-is-that">fits ipad air 1 perfectly the only downside is that &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>fits ipad air 1 perfectlythe only downside is that the adhesive for the screen isn&rsquo;t very strong which makes the screen a bit loose on one side. (i even removed the previous adhesive of the screen of the ipad before applying this one..however it does fit perfectly and functions well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-recommended">not recommended.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 6 months, I started to notice that spots on screen and delay on touch response. Need to look for another replacement. not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thank-you">Thank you!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great tools. Great shipping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lemon">Lemon?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t work right. The screen starts doing its own thing and it&rsquo;s so bad can&rsquo;t even use the iPad anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waste-of">Waste of</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The clear cover that&rsquo;s supposed to keep finger prints and thing off the front of didigitizer was glued down and now can&rsquo;t be used! Waste of money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-not-as-good-as-original">Works but not as good as original.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received my glass and put it on in about 45 minutes. First time ever replacing a screen. I put it on and it doesn&rsquo;t work as great as the original Apple screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="home-button-defective">Home button defective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Complete waste of time! The home button was defective! I plugged in my old home button and it worked fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-work">Did not work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not work, it is like something is constantly touching the screen and clicking things. Ipad acting like it&rsquo;s crazy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="crap">Crap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This will not fit the new iPad 5 like they say it does not have the same parts not Touch ID for home button so when u put it on it breaks they sent a new one and home button won&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-after-a-week">Broke after a week</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Digitizer stopped working after a week. Not happy I had to remove the glass and glue . I ordered another one from a different compant that works very good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-product">Awesome product !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product for the price !I was nervous not having done one before, played the youtube vids and went for it, it took me a while to get the old shattered glass out but&hellip;</p>
