<h5 id="so-what-does-this-plan-cover">So what does this plan cover?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So what does this plan cover? Answer, everything that is not excluded. What are these defects you ask. (1) Repairs caused by accidental damage, spilled liquids, insect infestation, misuse, abuse, or intentional physical damage. (3) Parts intended for replacement. (4) Cosmetic damage, and problems due to improper and/or non-factory authorized installation or repairs; (5) Damage resulting from Acts of God; (6) Products used for commercial purposes (8) Consequential or incidental damages, (9) “No Problem Found” diagnosis or failure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions; (10) Any failures, parts and/or labor costs incurred that are associated with a manufacturer’s recall, regardless of the manufacturer’s ability to pay for such repairs; (11) Pre-existing conditions; (12) Service or replacement outside of the USA; (13) Products not originally covered by a store return policy or manufacturer’s warranty, (14) Damages caused by third-party actions; (15) Liability or damage to property, or injury or death to any person or pet arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of the product; (16) Cost of preventative maintenance; (17) Seized or damaged parts(18) Products with safety feature(s); and much much more. These are but a few of the &ldquo;exclusions&rdquo; listed in the warrenty. So I ask again, what does this cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="order-number-in-policy-does-not-match-order-number-of-the-product-covered">Order number in policy does not match order number of the product covered.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought at the same time as the product that I wanted covered. I&rsquo;m not sure why but they have different order numbers. On the terms it says the order number of the warranty bought but not the order number of product covered. On the policy that was emailed it lists &ldquo;Unit Covered: Indicated on your Amazon order confirmation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unit Covered Price: Indicated on your Amazon order confirmation&rdquo;. The order number should match the product under warranty at the very least. I emailed them and have gotten no reply.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-as-long-as-you-don-t-use-it">Great buy as long as you don&rsquo;t use it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an Asurion plan on my cell phone. The phone malfunctioned and they provided a replacement after I paid the $117 deductible. A few months later the replacement phone failed with the same symptoms. This time the Asurion rep promised to replace it with a newer model and assured me that it would arrive in 2 days. It didn&rsquo;t. When I tried to track the shipment I learned that it hadn&rsquo;t been shipped. I called Asurion and was told that the shipment had been cancelled and the rep that promised the upgrade had been reprimanded. They were very sorry but not willing to comply with their agent&rsquo;s commitment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-and-fast">Easy and Fast</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased protection on my beats by Dre almost 2 years ago. It took Asurion only 2 days to issue me a credit for the full purchase price. Ordered a new set today that arrive tomorrow. Thanks asurion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-waste-your-time-and-money-on-this-insurance-scam">DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS INSURANCE SCAM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These people are totally unresponsive. Unlike Amazon&rsquo;s 30 day return this is a complete scam. You enter all the information on the claim and you hear nothing back. I have no idea if my claim was accepted, rejected, or being processed. Their chat line seems clueless and redundant to information provided in the claim process. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS INSURANCE SCAM!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-sure-that-this-is-a-good-product-and-will-provide-coverage">I am sure that this is a good product and will provide coverage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sure that this is a good product and will provide coverage.One note: Need to declare what unit the policy is covering on the confirmation.I think that this is a serious flaw. If you should acquire several policies for several items, it easy to be confused one for another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-to-have">Good to have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a firm believer in getting the extended warranty on all my appliances, electronics, and my car. Just this week the extended warranty on my car saved me a costly repair. I&rsquo;ve, unfortunately, had to use these warranties on my electronics as well. Asurion keeps track of your warranties. You can upload a receipt and name the warranty so you can keep up with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="need-to-identify-the-item-protected">Need to identify the item protected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be nice if the item which is covered were identified - when you have a dozen Asurion emails, which list only the Asurion order number, it becomes a royal pain to try and identify exactly what each one relates to! At least include the Amazon order number&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>Hopefully I won&rsquo;t need it but it is a good value for the elec.tric lawn mower</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-investment-in-durability">cheap investment in durability</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>hard to rate until need coverage</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy with my purchase. I think it&rsquo;s important to have additional product protection. Excellent product protection!</p>
