<h5 id="not-sure-about-those-small-screws">Not sure about those small screws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite done installing the projector yet so this is an interim report.I&rsquo;m installing a Benq HT1085ST projector in the basement with a rather lowish ceiling and absolutely needed a low profile mount. This mount is probably the lowest profile that is going to be physically possible to make that also allows some post-install pitch/roll/yaw adjustments. Watching the youtube instructional video is an absolute must, there&rsquo;s no way to do the first step correctly without it. Also, one thing not mentioned in the video is that after you&rsquo;ve got the first step done correctly you should not rotate the top or bottom portion. If you do rotate it the thing comes a bit loose. One set of the supplied screws for fastening to the projector worked for my projector, however the other screws that effectively hold the projector to the mount have a disturbingly short thread (maybe less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch) and it is scary to think that these 3 little screws are holding it all up.I managed to find a spot on the ceiling where I can hit the joist for support for 2 screws and thinking of getting toggle bolts for the other two (and not use the supplied wall anchors). I will report back once I&rsquo;m done hanging it all together.Update: Got it mounted and it is indeed a very low profile mount (see attached picture). After mounting it is a bit hard to get the right angle given that there&rsquo;s no way to make minute adjustments. Also, it&rsquo;s a bit loose on the horizontal plane i.e. moves a bit too easily. As long as the projector is not touched everything should remain in position. Some way to do minute adjustments would be nice even if they want to charge a bit more. Other than that everything is good, bumping up to 4 stars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw the bad reviews on this. But if you search Youtube for Silver Ticket Projector Mount, you&rsquo;ll find a whole series of videos on how to properly use this. The instructions that come with it are pretty basic, but the video shows how to do the whole thing on a few different projectors and it works like a champ. I don&rsquo;t regret buying this AT ALL!EDIT: Here&rsquo;s the youtube playlist. 11 videos that describe in great detail how to correctly assemble it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6YdzHVnaxE&amp;list=PLbic0zGsQtWeYQcSYTcZPB9ExpnY6IVYx">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6YdzHVnaxE&amp;list=PLbic0zGsQtWeYQcSYTcZPB9ExpnY6IVYx</a></p>

<h5 id="overall-happy-with-the-purchase">Overall - happy with the purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a mount that was as close to the ceiling as possible. There is still a little bit of wiggle that I can&rsquo;t get out between the ceiling base and mounting base where the two are joined - however - it&rsquo;s remained where I needed it to be with no movement. So it&rsquo;s a gotten the job done. For the price - you can beat it only thing to improve would be to use a the swing-out drywall anchor for maximum support - since my projector weight less than 8 lbs, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary. I pulled on the base mount when I was done and it didn&rsquo;t budge. Overall - happy with the purchase. It allowed me to mount the projector to maximize screen size and keep keystone at a minimum.</p>

<h5 id="best-low-priced-low-profile-projector-mount-i-could-find">Best low priced, low-profile projector mount I could find!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My projector offset required as low a profile mount as I could find to mount the screen where I wanted it. This mount ended up being just what I needed! It can be a little tricky to tighten the main nut to hold the final position, but that is the trade off from buying a $100+ mount. I paired this with my Optoma HD27 1080p 3D DLP Home Theater Projector. I didn&rsquo;t need the full extensions with my projector. Came with plenty of screws for the sizes I needed. I did use some washers I had on hand to mount level since my projector bottom isn&rsquo;t completely flat. See pics for details.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheapest-collection-of-parts-than-can-legally-be-called-a-projector-mount">Cheapest collection of parts than can legally be called a &ldquo;projector mount&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a joke! The time and effort (and extra hardware) required to actually use this product for its intended purpose makes me question the manufacturer&rsquo;s motives. Is this some sort of perseverance test? Are they just trying to mess with me? This is the cheapest collection of parts that can legally be called a &ldquo;projector mount.&ldquo;All the (poorly) threaded holes are filled with paint. If you do manage to get a screw started, expect the paint to flake off when the screw forces its way through the other side. If you persevere long enough to actually put this thing together (I&rsquo;m embarrassed to admit that I didn&rsquo;t give up sooner), plan on making a trip to the hardware store for some washers to use as stand-offs and and some screws to fit your projector. Best case scenario: after many hours of frustration you finally get this thing put together, attached to your projector, and mounted to your ceiling. But good luck adjusting it and getting it to stay in place!Move along. Don&rsquo;t waste your time. Spend a few dollars more and save yourself the headaches. If you received one of these as a gift or an add-on with another purchase, throw it away immediately!</p>

<h5 id="low-profile-low-price-worked-well-for-me">Low Profile, Low Price, worked well for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a really low profile mount to fit above my ceiling fan. This worked well.That said, people need to understand how the center &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; bolt works.I used some Locktite on the smaller threads that remain permanently installed in the extruded aluminum shaft.The large plastic locking ring needs to be able to travel a few turns up and down the larger diameter threads on the center bolt WITHOUT the center bolt spinning. The shoulder between the two thread sizes needs to sit tightly against the extruded aluminum post (hence the locktite).For my particular install, I had to drill a hole to get close enough to my projector&rsquo;s center of mass. I also used a few 0.25&rdquo; washers I had laying around to make the mounting flange level.Also, make sure you measure and understand the maximum depth you projector permits you to install mounting screws to. Mine was 7mm max, so I had to use washers to stay under that.Since there is only one locking ring to control all 6 degrees of freedom, it WILL take several tries to get it locked down and still aimed correctly.That said, good product for the price point. If you have less height restrictions than I did, a model with more individual adjustments may be easier to deal with.</p>
