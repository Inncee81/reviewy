<h5 id="excellent-quality-design-for-iphone-and-ipad">EXCELLENT QUALITY DESIGN FOR IPHONE AND IPAD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice&hellip; this foldable iPhone or iPad stand is super well made and I have bought a ton of different stands (both portable and other). I haven&rsquo;t really had the need for a great portable stand until last week. I have a 12.9&rdquo; iPad and it&rsquo;s a large device that can often be hard to depend upon the built in folio stand on my case. This stand is perfect for my iPhone plus; but it&rsquo;s also sturdy enough for my iPad. I am always concerned about scratching my gear and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if a small stand this strong would also be void of sharp edges or design issues. But this is a great choice for an office desk or bedside table. I have only been using this item for a short time; so if something negative shows up I will update my review. But this stand is worth the $20 price which is a bargain for this quality aluminum (thick and tight) stand. Definitely a great gift for anyone (because I think that everyone has at least one smart thing&hellip;.)&hellip; seriously I would highly recommended this for anyone who is in need of a small stand for your precious phone or tablet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-switch-stand-ever">Best Switch stand ever!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect!! Perfect for phone, tablet, Nintendo Switch! I bought it for my switch and it fold up perfectly, even fitting in my Switch case (in the mesh upper pocket of this Orzly Carry Case: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y6DYRXF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y6DYRXF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) For best folding, fold the little hooks into the holes. Then it&rsquo;s at its flattest shape.For the actual gaming experience, this thing is the best. I can set my switch on it, and it doesn&rsquo;t slide or move. The grippy material really keeps it there with friction. I can move my switch around to any angle with this thing! Perfect for on-the-go gaming when I want to take my switch to parties or to a friend&rsquo;s house. It&rsquo;s durable, well built, and has a nice almost heavy feel. Worth the price!!!</p>

<h5 id="this-stand-does-that-so-very-easily-it-s-actually-bigger-than-i-thought-it-would">This stand does that so very easily. It&rsquo;s actually bigger than I thought it would &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been wanting a stand that will hold my tablet over night so I could use it as a night clock. This stand does that so very easily.It&rsquo;s actually bigger than I thought it would be but that is fine as it easily holds both my tablet and case with zero issues.The stand is made with a heavy duty rugged feel, think tough rubber and heavy metal. It&rsquo;s got a heavy feel i love, as well as many different ways and heights to hooks your device In just the right angle for your needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stand-for-your-electronic-devices">Great stand for your electronic devices</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stand is just gorgeous! Starting with the unboxing - I did not receive any instructions, but realistically, this is three pieces of aluminum that has 2 pivot points. It is a very simple design, but there are so many flexibility in the angle and tilt. Currently I have my Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus sitting on the stand. I can keep my phone in either portrait or landscape mode, and still feel secure both ways. The stand appears to be rigid in the sense that your heavier phones would not cause sagging. In addition, the part where the device rests on has a soft padding in order to prevent scratching your device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-phone-tablet-holder">Great phone/tablet holder.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Five stars for what it is - keep an eye on the size to make sure it will suit your intended use (it&rsquo;s on the smaller side), but otherwise this is as good as anything in it&rsquo;s class; penny size rubber feet (a pretty good size for something like this), pretty tight friction hinges will hold any reasonably weighted tablet at arbitrary angles, unlike the hinges that snap into fixed positions (not that I&rsquo;ve really had a problem with the angles available on those, either).The part where you set the device is solid rubber over the metal backing. Had it for several weeks and am really happy with it so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="star-platinum-level-stand">Star Platinum level stand!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this primarily for use with my Switch, as I was dissatisfied with the plastic HORI Switch stand, as although that one is well built, it just didn&rsquo;t allow me to get proper viewing angles to avoid glare. THIS one, however, fixes that problem, as I can get pretty much any angle I need with the friction lock. As a nice bonus, this stand works perfectly for all of my other devices, like my tablet and phone. Tested it out with my friend&rsquo;s 10 inch tablet and it worked perfectly, they even looked this up to order it themselves.All-in-all, I can&rsquo;t find anything to complain about. Functional, portable, and at a decent price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-stand-for-all-devices">The perfect stand for all devices</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I initially bought this to use with my Nintendo Switch as it allows you to charge your Switch while playing, which is something you cannot do with the Switch&rsquo;s kickstand. I have tried 2 other Switch stands and this is by far my favorite. The flexibility of angles you can set it at is the main seller for me. It is also small and can fit easily in bags. It is made of metal and feels very durable opposed to some of the other Switch stands which are plastic. The bottom has rubber so you don&rsquo;t have to be worried about damaging tables. It has gotten to the point where this is such a good stand, I use it with my iPhone 7 Plus as it&rsquo;s stand as well. The only downside for me is that the arms poke out of the holes on the bottom so it isn&rsquo;t perfectly flush so it is awkward to have in your pocket, but that is not really an issue to me at all, and the pros definitely outweigh that only con for me.Pros:-Durable metal instead of plastic-Wide range of angles you can set it at opposed to 3 that most other Nintendo Switch stands allow-Can use with any deviceCons-The small arms stick out of the holes on the bottom when folded up so it isn&rsquo;t perfectly flat</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfectly-for-nintendo-switch">Works perfectly for Nintendo Switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stand is an excellent companion to the Nintendo switch if you want to play multiplayer on the go. The continuously adjustable angle means that you will always find the right position for optimal viewing. The stand also holds it&rsquo;s position very well. I used this to play multiplayer on a flight recently, and the stand held solid despite standard aircraft turbulence thanks to the solid joints and friction pads on the base. Not to mention, I was able to charge the console while playing (since the elevated position exposes the USB-C port), so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about losing power halfway through the long flight.This stand really helps fulfill the Switch&rsquo;s promise of multiplayer gaming anywhere! Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-built-sturdy-stand">Well built, sturdy stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for what it is. Small but sturdy design that holds the devices very well on my surfaces thanks to the weight and base size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="definately-a-must-buy">Definately a must buy!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product exceeded my expectations for performance. I have an heavy IPhone 7s Plus and it holds my phone up without any problem. I love using it for FaceTime with my family.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-rubber-coating-is-nice-too-so-you-do-not-scratch-your-screen-or">The rubber coating is nice too so you do not scratch your screen or &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very high quality stand! I purchased to use for my Nintendo Switch since the stand that is on the back of it is very flimsy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Good one. I was looking for one that had a little larger lip at the bottom to hold the phone. This one does.</p>

<h5 id="tips-easily">Tips Easily</h5>

<p>This stand tips over very easily. It would be a much better product if the bottom were weighted.</p>

<h5 id="top-quality-i-absolutely-love-it">Top quality - I absolutely love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this stand. It works great for both my iPhone 6 plus and iPad. Perfect for watching videos or playing Nintendo. It’s sturdy and nicely crafted.</p>
