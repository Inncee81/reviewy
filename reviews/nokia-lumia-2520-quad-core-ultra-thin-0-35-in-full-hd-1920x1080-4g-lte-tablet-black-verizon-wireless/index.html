<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome tablet! I am a senior in collage, and has spent last year using my iPad for notes and homework around campus. But after a while, I was still missing being able to use MS Office and found it to be more of a media consumption device, rather then an actual laptop replacement.I was hesitant in going with a Windows RT device, as I usually keep up with the technologies of the ever growing mobile world, and I had always heard not-so-great things. I had originally decided to go with the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 inch, but when I found the Lumina 2520, I couldn&rsquo;t pass it up. The Tablet comes with MS Office suite, which is a huge plus for anyone trying to use this for school ( I had tried other office suites available for iOS and Android before, but found some features missing or that formatting back to MS Office had some problems like file corruption or shifting the spacing and headings/pictures around). I don&rsquo;t get missing pictures or content on sites like WebAssign, which sometimes happened on the iPad too). My school also uses Noodle (which if anyone has used this, I&rsquo;m sorry) which allllllways gave me problems with mobile access. All these problems have gone away, and I can now download and open documents my teachers post a lot more easily, as well as use Excel readily.I got mine with the Power Keyboard, which blows the ZAGG keyboard out of the water ( what I had on my iPad) The keyboard is a little heavy, but typing on it is way more easy and comfortable. It also comes with a little trackpad, for using a mouse, which IOS does not support at all. The keyboard snaps the tablet up to a great viewing angle in a great magnetic thud, and locks firmly in place, rather then using the lip/edge of the iPad in a crease of the keyboard. It also comes with 2 full sized USB ports for attaching a mouse or full keyboard (or controller or whatever you want) as well. The device itself has a micro HDMI out and micro USB 3 port as well, with a bay for a micro SIM card and SD storage card. But probably the best feature is that fact it comes with an extra battery, built right in, to push the operating time past any ultrbook or tablet I&rsquo;ve used before. I am not sure of the exact times, but with moderate use like internet surfacing and watching videos etch. I haven&rsquo;t needed to charge in 4 days.The tablet itself is very well made. I find that Nokia makes really high quality devices ( I recently switched to a Nokia Lumina windows phone as well and couldn&rsquo;t be happier). The screen is the average 10.1 inch but in this case, as opposed to the iPad, it is in 1080p and 16:9 aspect ratio. This means when I&rsquo;m remotely accessing my home desktop ( I have racked up over 30 hours playing Dark Souls 2 like this using splashtop app and it works great!) it&rsquo;s like having the exact desktop in my lap. Where as with my iPad, I had to pick between using a nice resolution, but have 2 huge black bars at the top and bottom, or choose a muddy resolution of 800x600, something like that.There are two nice cameras which work well for Skype, but that&rsquo;s all I use my cameras for. But they take nice pictures, and Nokia provides great applications for editing or making videos with. They will share across all your windows devices if you have a an account set up, and works flawlessly so far. Speaking of the app store, it isn&rsquo;t as bad as you have heard elsewhere. There are a ton of apps in there, but maybe not so many games, and I haven&rsquo;t found anything that mimics airplay functionality, but the drives does support Maracas, as well as play to or project to for DLNA capable HDTVs and whatnot. In the app store I was able to get the standard stuff too, Flipboard, Facebook, Remote access, and media stuff like Netflix and Hulu but found Amazon still hasn&rsquo;t released their Instant Video for Prime. Instead, the Internet Explorer browser has Flash baked in, and you can just go to the website and play them there. I made a tile for my homescreen that opens to my library, and presto, works like a charm.Anyways, windows RT 8.1 runs very smoothly ( I&rsquo;d say visually as smooth as the iPad and both smoother then the Galaxy tabs I tested) and I haven&rsquo;t had any problems. Desktop mode works great when using the Office suite, and the ability to open more then one apps at once is a huge plus and definite breathe of fresh air over iOS 7. If you&rsquo;re at all thinking about a tablet I highly recommend this one. It&rsquo;s super cheap compared to the competition, has outstanding build quality, and great functionality (Even 4g LTE access from Verizon, where you can go and test it out first by the way. Seriously could not be more happy with my purchase., and glad I did.</p>

<p>This tablet was purchased for my boyfriend who wanted a tablet with Windows operating system. He is a writer for a living and wanted to be able to use this anyplace to write or research. We are very pleased with the size, screen (picture is incredible), and response time. One of his requirements was for the tablet to have USB ports, and this does. The price is very reasonable for the quality of the product and when it is paired with the Nokia keyboard, this is a tablet that functions as any laptop. We purchased it with cellular capability and he is able to work with it almost anywhere. My only issue is that I own an iPad and am not used to working with the Windows system.</p>

<p>I love it, it&rsquo;s a great machine it&rsquo;s fast and meets many of my current needs for a mini computer, however I recently just bought the product and am still getting know all all it&rsquo;s features, maybe in a few months I&rsquo;ll provide a follow up update.There is one big drawback to this device - the Apps store - it has virtually no good apps for this device. I own the Lumia 1520 and there are many apps for that device no complaints there. However, I am hoping this issue will be solved with the roll-out of Windows 10 next month.</p>
