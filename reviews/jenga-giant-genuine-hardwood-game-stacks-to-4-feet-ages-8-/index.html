<h5 id="jenga-bells-jenga-bells-you-re-the-best-to-play">Jenga Bells.. Jenga Bells.. You&rsquo;re The Best To Play</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>$8 for a block of wood that keeps us and friends entertained for hours on. It&rsquo;s well worth the tiny investment. Anyone complaining about this game whether new or classic should invest in a new set of eyes. People have grown so impatient these days it&rsquo;s sad to listen to and watch. This game can be enjoyed by family, friends, kids, adults and people of all ages, sizes, sexes, races, cultures and backgrounds. Advice for today&rsquo;s generation would be, instead of giving a child an iP** or Xb**, try challenging and watching how much joy and excitement a 5 year receives from simply building the blocks. If the task is too monotonous and time consuming for the average adult, it would be a tremendous achievement for some children to build it themselves. Perhaps more for those who aren&rsquo;t accustomed to being stuck behind a TV or LCD screen. Maybe some children wouldn&rsquo;t care thinking about the challenge of pulling out each square. That can be boring for kids too. So why not munch on a few pretzels, and start a conversation while the little ones enjoy this game too. Then when it&rsquo;s finished being stacked, have a try at winning a game of Jenga. This game is one of the true classics from American pastimes. Also, I&rsquo;ve recently learned that allot of countries don&rsquo;t play board or puzzle games like America does. So please don&rsquo;t knock this game for all it&rsquo;s worth. Small price to pay for an exchange for so much happiness.</p>

<h5 id="not-exactly-giant-but-pretty-big">Not exactly GIANT, but pretty big!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love Jenga! We&rsquo;ve played it for years - at home, on vacation, at friend&rsquo;s houses - it&rsquo;s a great game and everyone we know loves it, and this giant Jenga has kicked it up a notch. First off, let me say that this isn&rsquo;t Giant as much as it is Large. Giant makes me think of Jenga pieces so big that it takes two hands to pick them up, and there are companies that make yard-sized Jenga knock-offs with pieces that are three feet across. This is not that. It&rsquo;s Jenga x2: the pieces are exactly twice as big as the original Jenga pieces. 6&rdquo; compared to 3&rdquo; - so everything is doubled. So, it&rsquo;s large, but still manageable. You can still play it on a coffee table or dining room table, you don&rsquo;t need to clear a place on the floor. You do have to be careful though because when the tower comes down those big pieces fly! It&rsquo;s no more or less fun than the original, but it is a lot easier for guys with big hands to play&hellip; we have friends who alway find the original Jenga frustrating because their fingers are too big to delicately remove the small pieces. They love this one though! Jenga is a great game and this is an excellent addition to the Jenga family.PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.</p>

<h5 id="fun-game">Fun game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The classic game of jenga. Very fun, and my daughter loves knocking things over so it makes for a perfect combo. This is a newer version then the one that we had when we were younger as the building guide is now cardboard rather than the plastic that it used to be. I prefer the older plastic as it was a bit stronger and made it easier to put into and take out of the box. The cardboard is also a bit more flexible so it makes assembly a little more difficult. That is the only reason for the 4 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-game-for-kids-and-adults">Great game for kids and adults</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This game was a huge hit at the wedding! Kids and adults played with it all night long. I would definitely suggest getting a table or something to lift the game a little higher off the ground. We put it on a wooden crate to create a more dramatic fall at the end of the game.We debated about purchasing the &ldquo;bonus blocks&rdquo; that are commonly purchased alongside this game. I feel like the wooden crate created enough height for the game and the extra blocks may have been a little much if we had purchased them. Especially due to the amount of small children that were playing the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-yet">Fun yet&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shipping: The shipping was good I ordered this on July 20th, 2014 and received it on July 24th, 2014. The box was a little beaten up so I was worried it wasn&rsquo;t brand new but when I opened the game, everything was sealed in it&rsquo;s plastic and all the contents were there.Product: I find this a really fun game. I like how you can play it by yourself or with friends. I&rsquo;m a little worried though about a few things. The blocks don&rsquo;t feel well sanded and I&rsquo;m worried that either a friend or myself will get a splinter. I don&rsquo;t really like the shape of this box either for when you want to put it up, it doesn&rsquo;t feel big enough. Even when I got the stack of blocks out of the box the first time it seems too small.Overall: This is a very fun but like I said, be careful about the poorly sanded blocks.</p>

<h5 id="surprise-it-s-for-kids-too">Surprise! It&rsquo;s for kids too!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Adults have fun playing Jenga but to my surprise our five year old grandson just loved it. When not playing with someone else he uses the pieces for &ldquo;building&rdquo; things. Builds great patience and coordination!! Try this for a kids gift for Christmas, the parents will thank you!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-wood-not-satisfied">Cheap wood, not satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad quality. Light. I played it only once, just to test the quality for a few minutes, but after I played, I saw few of them are visibly cracked. I don&rsquo;t mind if the cracked parts are tiny, but they weren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m actually not sure if they are cracked during shipping or while I play it. Whatever the reason is, it is true they crack easily. If they are sturdy enough, they would not be cracked. Since some of are already cracked, I don&rsquo;t think I can use it for a long time. I should have bought another one.. T.T</p>

<h5 id="generic-brand-with-poor-quality">Generic brand with poor quality!!</h5>

<p>The product I received was a generic brand not the original jenga game by Hasbro! Very disappointed! No response from the seller!</p>

<p>Used this as a guest book at our wedding. All of the guests loved it and my husband and I have enjoyed reading all of the advice and memories written on the pieces as we play!</p>
