<p>ED 4 Pack CINEMA 3D GLASSES For LG 3D TVs – Adult Sized Passive Circular Polarized 3D Glasses</p>

<p>These amazing 3D glasses are a higher quality replacement for official LG 3D Glasses AG-F310, AGF210, AG-F220, AGF310, AG-F216 , AG-F260, AG-F240, AG-F200, AG-F230</p>

<p>Works perfectly with all passive 3D Televisions - SONY, Panasonic, Vizio, Toshiba, LG, Philips and JVC. RealD Matched to work in home or in traditional theaters!</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: These 3D glasses are passive 3D glasses and will not work with active Shutter glasses applications. eDimensional inc. is a registered trademark.</p>

<p>Prior to now passive 3D glasses were either to heavy, bulky, horribly overpriced, scratched too easily or just plain low quality throw away style 3D glasses. eDimensional went back to the drawing board to bring you the best value as virtually every manufacturer got it wrong. You may have been to a 3D theater and gotten glasses that were recycled and scratched on the lenses – we decided to double our cost of manufacturing the lenses to make our lenses 2-3 times as thick as theater glasses and we designed them with scratch resistant lenses not to mention we also include a glasses cleaning cloth so there is no guessing on what to use to keep your lenses clean for a longer life. You may have found that your 3D glasses plastic broke after a few uses. We also doubled the cost of our plastic only using virgin top quality plastic that is durable and will bend quite a bit prior to breaking. You may have had 3D glasses that were bulky and too heavy. Our 3D glasses are light as a feather and you will forget that you are wearing them. Don’t mistake the light weight for low quality as you would have to try very hard to break them and with proper use they will last virtually forever. Finally you can now get top quality 3D Glasses at the best prices around that are perfect for virtually everyone!</p>

<h5 id="decent-bargain-glasses-4th-place-out-of-5-tested">Decent Bargain Glasses - 4th place out of 5 tested.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked these as the fourth place out of 5 different glasses I bought for my new LG 4k OLED 3D TV. Ok to buy if you just need to save money and want something better then movie theater glasses. (details below)Background: I have enjoyed 3D for years and always used a 1080p projector with active glasses(heavy and battery powered) Passive was not as good at home until 4k TV&rsquo;s came out. Now you get better resolution using lighter glasses with better color rendering, clarity, and contrast. Problem is&hellip; most everyone has used those cheap flimsy glasses and I wanted to find the best available. I am some what of a perfectionist and also had a recent brain injury that makes me hyper sensitive to many things. I can&rsquo;t stand glasses that have lens glare, ghosting, and any discomfort in fit. I decided after all my pickiness at deciding I might as well share all my data :-)Below I compared the top 5 glasses that I bought after researching what is currently available. I compared the following elements which I then gave individual ratings (1-5).*Lens Glare - the amount of noticeable glare on the back side of the lens. I tested in medium room lighting and then in total darkness with only the light from the screen (2 scores, room lighting / no lighting). I tested using the films &lsquo;Gravity&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flight of the Butterflies&rsquo; in 3D. The black starry space scenes of Gravity were excellent to test for lens glare and also ghosting.*Ghosting or Cross talk - this happens when the polarized lenses do not completely block the opposite eye. You see a ghost image of the other eye and it can be distracting!*Contrast and Color - I saw some differences in the depth of contrast and slight hue changes between the glasses.*Comfort - needs no explanation :-)*Durability/Build Quality - these were better glasses then movie theater for sure but still the best only compared to $30 sunglasses.TOP CHOICEPolaroid Premium COVER Passive 3D Glasses*Lens Glare - <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>*Ghosting or Cross talk - 5*Contrast and Color - 5 Very good contrast and colors were better.

<h5 id="3d">3D!!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best value I could find to make sure my new 3D TV has enough pairs for everyone! They&rsquo;re a little smaller than the ones that came with my LG, but the LG ones were almost too big for my wife, and these fit her perfect and they still fit on my big head if I had to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-and-a-great-product">Great price and a great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so much less money than the OEM LG glasses and they work perfectly. A nice feature on these is that they have a ledge inside the glasses that reat them nicely on your prescription glasses. I never had to readjust them once while watching a movie. Highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-the-oem-glasses">Better than the OEM glasses.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I like these better than the ones that came with my LG TV. Very comfortable even over regular eyeglasses. The frames are quite sturdy for kid use. Just keep a microfiber towel around for easy lens cleaning. With this four pack, and the two that came with the TV, there is plenty for everyone to have a pair and enjoy some 3D TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-lenses-are-smaller-than-lg-and-a-better-fit-than-the-lg-version-for-young-children">The lenses are smaller than LG and a better fit than the LG version for young children</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These glasses were used in conjunction with a 2015 LG 3D television. The quality of the glasses was equal to that of LG&rsquo;s own product. The frames are a bit thicker than the LG version but felt to be the right size and weight. They are heavier than the LG offerings and feel more substantial than LG&rsquo;s. The lenses are smaller than LG and a better fit than the LG version for young children. My elementary aged son felt more comfortable with these glasses then he did with the official LG model.As for the image quality, through careful comparison of these against the LG models - there was no discernible difference in image quality between the LG and this product. If anything, the LG glasses seemed less uniform in their surface appearance. That is, the LG glasses had a visible &lsquo;wave&rsquo; when looked at them from the side while these glasses appeared more consistent and uniform. If I were to speculate, I would guess that the lenses themselves are slightly thicker than the LG model.All-in-all these are excellent glasses and well worth the low cost when compared to the official LG model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-long-lasting">Sturdy, long lasting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are actually the best, sturdiest 3D glasses I&rsquo;ve come across. I&rsquo;m not sure if the lenses are actually thicker but they&rsquo;re curved. This makes the lens more rigid for cleaning and everyday use. These have lasted longer than any others I&rsquo;ve purchased. Recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-get-the-job-done">They Get the Job Done</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The price is right, and the glasses do the job. I&rsquo;ve now had them for over a year, and they show no sign of damage. They are very light, and fit like a regular pair of sun glasses. You can definitely wear them for lengthy movies like The Hobbit, and not be in discomfort. They work perfectly with my Vizio 3D TV. You would not be able to tell the difference between these glasses, and the ones that come with the TV. Definitely buy these if you&rsquo;re looking to add more 3D glasses to your home entertainment system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-3d-glasses-if-your-tv-uses-the-passive-system">Perfect 3D Glasses if your TV uses the &lsquo;passive&rsquo; system.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I purchased an LG OLED TV which uses passive glasses. I bought these at Best Buy for less than the cost of a BATTERY for Active glasses. There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason to pay any more for name brand glasses. They are all the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-for-good-3d-glasses">Great price for good 3D glasses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I have enough 3D glasses for all the children and guests who might come over when we watch 3D movies!</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Yes very good love them they work good</p>

<h5 id="better-than-original-lg-glasses">Better than original LG glasses.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Cinema 3D glasses for LG 3D Tvs are an improvement over the 3D glasses that came with my LG 3D TV. Better viewing and not as easily broken as the originals. Worth the cost.</p>
