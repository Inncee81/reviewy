<h5 id="you-get-much-less-than-you-pay-for">You get much less than you pay for!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad experience with this screen. It curls at the ends has ripples, screen door effect along with other artifacts as well as encourages hot spotting. The customer service is not helpful and looks for any and all excuses not to complete the RMA. Would not buy or recommend regardless of the low price!Look at the pictures I posted and then read ELITES last correspondence with me below:Mr. Torres,&ldquo;With respect, regardless of where the screen was purchased from, the finding is the same - this is 100% normal standard for this product.With no defect to be seen in your previous photos, or the photo you just provided, the claim is respectfully denied and now closed at this time.&ldquo;Charlie BarrentosSenior Customer Service</p>

<h5 id="video-of-125-elite-screen-rolling-down">Video of 125&rdquo; Elite Screen rolling down</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With all the positive reviews about this screen, I felt it would be useful for you to be able to see the power screen rolling down so you can see how long, smooth, and quiet the operation is. Mine is the 125&rdquo; version.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-like-a-small-movie-theater-screen">Its like a small movie theater screen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen that I purchased has turned my man-cave into a private little movie theater.If you have the right movie projector and sound system, trust me , when you view your blu-ray movies on this screen,the resolution will amaze you.With the items I have purchased from ADC,I no longer even need to go to the actual movie theater.This screen is very large, takes up my entire wall.It comes with two remote controls, one hand -held, and one that you can hard wire into the wall. I hooked both of them up. Word of caution.Do not try to install this screen by yourself. You are going to have to measure your wall and center the screen precisely.The screen is not light-it&rsquo;s got some weight.You will need anchors for your ceiling.I recommend you get a professional to install it. Trust me folks, you are going to love this movie screen. Once you have it hooked up, wait until night time, pull your shades, turn on the movie,set back and enjoy! Highly recommended !</p>

<h5 id="very-pleased-with-the-screen-but-paltry-mounting-hardware">Very pleased with the screen but paltry mounting hardware</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen was fairly easy to mount by hanging from the ceiling but the way they explain on how to hang it leaves it at a bit of an awkward angle. I dropped a star for the paltry installation hardware it came with. You basically get the screen and you pretty much need to use your creativity from there if you aren&rsquo;t mounting it to a couple studs. It does come with a small level that could be handy if you don&rsquo;t have one already. I found it easiest to mount using large ceiling anchors hanging it by S-hooks on the back holes as they explain, correcting for the awkward way it hangs by screwing small <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch blocks against the rear mounting bracket so it could rest against the square crown moulding it was butt up against. Without doing that it would swing back and the screen wouldn&rsquo;t come out directly from the slit but an an angle. It probably doesn&rsquo;t matter but it didn&rsquo;t seem right to stress the motor and screen unnecessarily. Anyway, besides a complete lack of mounting hardware except some wall anchors and screws, the screen itself is excellent. After hanging for several days it has straightened out a bit from when I first extended the screen. I know some people have complained about it curling at the corners but mine (albeit one of the largest so it&rsquo;s probably less susceptible) is almost perfect, with just an ever-so-slight curl at the extreme bottom corners that has since just about worked itself straight.The motor is smooth albeit slow, but really, who cares as long as it doesn&rsquo;t take ten minutes. The remote works well as does the wall mounted switch. I didn&rsquo;t bother connecting the trigger to the projector.I had no issues with this screen and I&rsquo;m really happy with it, with the exception of the terrible mounting instructions and lack of any mounting hardware. Given this screen is so huge it REALLY needs better mounting instructions. In a dark room, it presents a sharp bright image with a BenQ HT2050 projector with no added grain or blurriness, and given it&rsquo;s not a tensioned screen, it&rsquo;s surprisingly straight and seems to work itself out if you let it hang for a few days. The black borders do a good job of absorbing any stray light keeping the image nice and sharp at the edges with no weird bleed or reflection.</p>

<p>So far a great screen, the only issue I can complain about is it not flat when down and waves can be seen on the picture when a movie scene is in motion.</p>
