Product description
The Coolpix S570 combines stylish design with high performance and advanced functions for shooting ease. Advanced design technologies combine to create an ultra slim, less than 1 inch thick body. The COOLPIX S570 also features the compositional freedom and quality optics of a precision 5x Zoom-NIKKOR lens with 28mm wide-angle coverage.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Style meets simplicity. 5x wide angle zoom in a super slim body.</p>

<p>Nikon’s stylish and simple Coolpix S570 combines 12.0 effective megapixels with a 5x optical Wide Angle Zoom-Nikkor glass lens for stunning prints as large as 16x20 inches. The sleek, all-metal design makes it easy to carry, and the incredible, bright 2.7-inch LCD makes it easy to compose and share pictures. The Coolpix S570, with Nikon’s 4 Way VR Image Stabilization, combines four technologies that get you sharp, crisp pictures. The Coolpix S570 features Nikon’s Smart Portrait System that finds faces, removes red-eye, softens fine skin lines, fires the shutter when your subject smiles and warns you if they blink.</p>

<p>A smart, flat design equipped with advanced functions for capturing precious moments with simplicity and style</p>

<p>The Coolpix S570 features a 5x zoom Nikkor lens with 28mm wide-angle coverage and the performance benefits of Nikon&rsquo;s innovative EXPEED digital image-processing concept. With 12.0 effective megapixels of sharp resolution and a flat body that fits right in your pocket, the Coolpix S570 offers carefree and flexible shooting.</p>

<p>The Coolpix S570 is equipped with Nikon&rsquo;s Smart Portrait System, a series of advanced functions that help produce consistently great portraits. The new Skin Softening function automatically detects and analyzes the subject&rsquo;s skin and then adjusts smoothness for enhanced results. Face-priority AF automatically detects as many as 12 faces in the shot and helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the priority subject smiles while the Blink Proof function automatically shoots two sequential frames and saves the one in which the subject’s eyes are wide open. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects any perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory.</p>

<p>The Coolpix S570&rsquo;s high sensitivity of up to ISO 3200 at any image size up to its maximum of 4000 x 3000 pixels enables flexibility when shooting in low light or when capturing fast-moving subjects. This creates new opportunities to take sharper, more natural-looking photos the moment they occur.</p>

<p>Nikon Coolpix S570 Feature Highlights</p>

<p>EXPEED digital imaging technology</p>

<p>VR image stabilization in action
Nikon’s smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon’s comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography.</p>

<p>Four advanced image stabilizing features help ensure sharper results
Nikon&rsquo;s electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. ISO 3200 capability at any image size up to its maximum of 4000 x 3000 pixels allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. Nikon’s original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus.</p>

<p>Nikon’s Smart Portrait System with Skin Softening
Face-priority AF helps produce more satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure for as many as 12 faces in the framed shot. Skin Softening function detects and analyzes a framed subject’s skin, and then adjusts smoothness to produce enhanced results. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the subject smiles, while its Blink Proof function shoots two sequential frames, then saves the one in which the subject’s eyes are widest open. Blink Warning presents an alert when it suspects that someone in the shot has blinked. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects any perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory.</p>

<p>Smart functionality, carefree shooting
Nikon’s Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot, making it faster and easier to capture the moment. The Coolpix S570 uses this intelligent function to analyze the subject and surrounding setting and automatically selects the most appropriate of the following six scene modes to achieve optimal results&ndash;Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, Night Landscape, Close-up, or Backlight.</p>

<p>Quick Retouch
Quick Retouch automatically adjusts the contrast and saturation of selected photos to create an enhanced copy with the right finishing touch.</p>

<h5 id="very-cool-little-camera">Very &ldquo;COOL&rdquo; little camera !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I made this purchase for my wife for christmas .Although I bought this some time ago she just opened it for Christmas and she LOVES it!very easy to use and the quality is great..very light very easy no problems what so ever .Her hobby is photography so she finds it very easy to use and she knows her numbers and what to set it on so it is one nice little camera for when she dont want to lug around her bigger one. we have read reviews for this camera and we do not find anything wrong with it ..some say it is slow between shots .. My wife does not at all find this camera slow between shots..no waySome also say its blurry when you playback the photos.. Ours is not blurry at all and I played my photos back on my 32 inch HD TV..they come out clear as a bell.But some people DO have that problem..here is a solution that my wife says to do&hellip;.DO NOT in any way ROTATE your photos from the camera..this could damage the memory chip you have so what we always do is Hook the camera up to the computer then load the shots on to that ..then you can rotate all you want..you will see the difference .I hope that helps people.Also..we have no need to use the software for it either.. we just plug the camera to the computer and take my shots off the camera that way (just open the file) ..then I use my own photo sofware .. and Again not a problem at allThe Video is also cute on it..I wouldnt film &ldquo;important things&rdquo; such as one time events..but just for quick things..then its good .but thats not what my wife wants to use it for. so we dont mind it .All in all we are very very happy with this camera.Thank you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many good cameras in this category to select from, and all have Pro&rsquo;s and Con&rsquo;s that ultimately are reported in these user reviews. These are personal opinion&rsquo;s, and mostely not scientific. This review for the Nikon S570 tells you why I chose this camera over the others.Since I was looking for a camera that was portable and easy to use I chose to look at these &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; style cameras. I&rsquo;ve owned Canon, Olympus, Kodak and Nikon. I&rsquo;ve found that what I consider important is the ability to get to the picture taking mode quickly. The next most important feature I look for is a menu system that is intuitive so that I can figure out how to do the things I want to do on a routine basis, like transfer pictures, delete those I don&rsquo;t want and perform a little in-camera editing. Lastly, I look for a camera that has some automatic modes that make sense on daily use type cameras, like night mode, portraits and landscape modes.For the price I got this camera for on Amazon, this one is tops in speed and easy use. It get&rsquo;s you to taking picturs very fast, from the time you open the box, until your a pro with it and just need to capture a quick shot. No matter the situation, from family gatherings to landscapes, or low light shots to skinging movies, this camera rises to the challenge.I recommend spending the extra money for a large SD card to go along with the 12 MP capability and movie action. If your going to keep it handy, It&rsquo;s worth the extra expense to get a slim case. (something that is easy to open) Finally, even though this camera is not a professional type instrument, I&rsquo;ve attached it to a tripod and have taken some photos over a wide exposure range to process as high dynamic range images. This camera worked pretty good for this function. (I consider this a little more advanced function for this type of camera, but the situation called for a small portable unit like this one.)Get one for yourself and buy one as a gift.</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did quite a bit of research before buying this camera, and I am quite pleased. I am a pro photographer who uses the Nikon SLR system, and was looking for a point and shoot. Although I am a loyal Nikon shooter, I realize that Nikon has not been the leader in the point and shoot market. However, this model has a great feel to it, sturdy and solid. It is small enough to take anywhere, and makes amazing photos,I love it. I think that a lot of the negative hype about this camera is from people who do not read the user&rsquo;s manual, and who do not have any skills in the area of photography. In my experience with this camera, it performs exactly as I expect it to- because I read the manual! Trust me, it&rsquo;s an awesome little camera.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-believe-the-hype">Don&rsquo;t believe the hype</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not a professional photographer, I take pictures of my kids primarily. I was looking for a point and shoot that takes good still pictures for vacations. I was tired of hauling my heavy Nikon D50 and associated accessories everywhere. Well, after one 4 day trip of average to useless pictures, I am sending it back. I am in disbelief that all of these reviews are so favorable for this product.1. The picture quality is NOT GOOD: It takes ok outdoor pictures, but they lack depth. Indoors - the flash is useless. It will either add no light, or wash out the light colors and the subject&rsquo;s faces, even in portrait mode.2. S-L-O-W: If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting 5 full seconds between pictures, this camera might be for you. I used a class 4 memory card and it still takes 5 seconds to write to the card and focus again.3. Battery life is average at best and you cannot charge the battery in the camera.4. Actually something positive: the menu and buttons are really easy to use, the LCD is nice. The power button is finicky though and too small.5. BEWARE turning it off too quickly: I ruined at least 10% of my pictures by turning the camera off too quickly after taking a picture. It will write the picture to the card but will overlay the colors causing it too look like an old film shot that got double exposed.In short, I highly advise not buying this camera unless you are going to take still shots outdoors in good light and don&rsquo;t care about actually seeing the eyes of your subjects.</p>
