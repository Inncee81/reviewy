</ul>

<p>Style:w/ 18-55mm
For next-level AF operation, the EOS 80D camera has a wide-area, 45-point, all cross-type AF system*. Excellent in dim light, it has improved low luminance performance to EV -3 and is compatible with most EF lenses (lenses with maximum apertures of f/8 or higher, and some lenses with extenders attached may operate at a maximum of 27 points). It also features 4 types of AF area selection modes useful for a number of different AF situations. These include user-selectable Single-point AF, Zone AF, where users can select from one of 9 predefined AF zones; Large Zone AF, where one of three zones can be selected; and 45-point AF auto selection, where the camera detects the AF point automatically. * The number of AF points, cross-type AF points and Dual cross-type AF points vary depending on the lens used.</p>

<h5 id="i-saved-money">I Saved Money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There were no other reviews, and little info on the international model. So I was worried about how the this model might differ from the normal model, which currently costs about 250 dollars more. But I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box.The camera came with:- 1 battery (0% charged though)- Canon EOS 80D Strap- The battery charger.And the language was already set to English.The main difference in the international version is the lack of a warranty which would normally be a one-year warranty provided by Canon.But you save $250 when buying this version. So I put that money towards a four year warranty through Warrentech for $89.99. Amazon gives you this option when buying the camera. When you add your own warranty, you end up with three more years of protection compared to Canon&rsquo;s standard warranty that comes with the non-international version. The difference is that any repairs are provided through Warrentech instead of Canon. 4 Year Camera Accident Protection Plan ($900-1000)The one minute downside is that the shipping is a bit slower coming from Japan. It takes 4-5 days as opposed to the normal 2 day shipping.So after buying a warranty separately, I saved $160 and have a four-year protection plan. I&rsquo;m a happy camper!</p>

<h5 id="glad-i-bought-it">Glad I bought it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only had a few days. But so far I love it.It&rsquo;s the real thing, the cost difference comes from cutting out the middle man and the warranty, I think.I found that I was still able to go on Canon USA and download the EOS Utility app.Heads up though, Amazon suggests a warranty with this product but the company doesn&rsquo;t actually cover it. It&rsquo;s in the fine print of terms and conditions of a few differ companies that offer electronic extended warranties. I asked customer support they said yes, but I&rsquo;d sent an email to few companies and they said they do not cover products that never had the manufacturers warranty. There may be a way around it, but I didn&rsquo;t want to risk it.If your truly worried about your equipment, look into getting insurance. You can get your camera covered under home/renter insurance and places like State Farm. But if you&rsquo;re thinking of going pro, go for PPA and the like as they offer more benefits for pro photographers. A lot of the time insurance will not only cover drops/spills but theft too!Anyways I love the camera, it&rsquo;s operating great, excited to shoot more and more, and friends are jealous of my shiny new 80D! Happy to save a bit of money and and used it to get other equipment.</p>

<h5 id="and-having-full-hd-at-60fps-is-nice-the-video-quality-is-quite-good-and-this">and having full HD at 60fps is nice. The video quality is quite good and this &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this camera mainly for video to shoot weddings. I use full frame cameras for the photography but this one is now them main camera for video capture. The autofocus tracking during video is really impressive, and having full HD at 60fps is nice. The video quality is quite good and this camera is a huge upgrade for video capture from previous versions i.e. 60d. The image quality is very usable at 3200 ISO. There are a lot of interesting features on this camera such as timelaspe and 2x zoom at 1080 video that add to the value. I would not hesitate to buy the foreign market camera and save some money.</p>

<h5 id="way-better-than-70d-and-international-version-is-great">WAY better than 70D and International version is GREAT.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great deal!I was slightly skeptical of the &ldquo;international&rdquo; model, but after watching a couple Youtube videos, I gained assurance that it was legitimate.It arrived last week, and it is everything I hoped. The camera was perfect, and it works beautifully.I do not have time to write a lot now, but I bought the 70D last year (non-international version, and from a local dealer to boot) and have been less than happy with it. It has major focus issues that took months to figure out and then hours calibrating all my lenses to minimize the problems. See my other review.The 80D, however, right out of the box does not have the same problem.I am loving it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed-to-replace-my-60d">Exactly what I needed to replace my 60D</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been using a Canon 60D for 3 years before I decided to upgrade. This camera beats it in virtually every aspect: sharpness, weight, ISO range, low light preformance, and even has multiple new features, like the touch screen. I love the facial recognition in auto-focus mode (though I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of manual focus,) which really makes the camera great for videos.What can I really say that hasn&rsquo;t been said in other reviews? This is a fantastic camera for the price and is wonderful despite not being the &ldquo;American Version,&rdquo; but who can really argue with saving close to $300 for the same camera?It&rsquo;s only been a couple days and I already love this thing. My advice is that if you are hesitant about purchasing an international model, pull the trigger on buying this thing. If you are very worried about damaging it, buy some type of warranty; Amazon even offers one at checkout.</p>

<h5 id="go-international-version">GO INTERNATIONAL VERSION!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took a couple days to receive the product but came just like they said it would. I got the body by itself and it was neatly wrapped in buble wrap and the cloth wrap. Upgrading from the 60D, it is a huge difference! Honestly, you will take a photo and see how much more defined and detailed it is and just be amazed. The auto focus with the video is so smooth and looks amazing! The feel of the camera is just perfect, gives you the perfect grip on the camera and it isnt heavy at all. IT JUST FEELS RIGHT! I bought the international version with the extended 4 year warrenty from an outside provider. If you buy from Canon its gonna cost you $1.2K and you only get a 1 year warrenty but if you go international version you can get it for $890+65$ for the 4 year warrenty and it will only cost you $955. Saving so much money and getting 3 more years coverage. Think about it.</p>

<h5 id="i-felt-the-worst-that-could-happen-is-that-id-receive-a-camera">i felt the worst that could happen is that id receive a camera &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading up on international orders, i felt the worst that could happen is that id receive a camera with settings from a different country, or a manual in a different language. ALL WENT WELL&hellip; i got the camera, its awesome lens, a strap, and an english and spanish manual. I say it was definently a smart choice. I got $200-300 off my purchase, and there was absolutly nothing wrong. I lowered my expectations, and they were lifter</p>

<p>Had the 70D and decided to &ldquo;up-grade&rdquo;&hellip;..probably just a fantasy in that the 70D took very good shots and so does the 80D, but, since I had a few extra $s I took the leap&hellip;</p>
