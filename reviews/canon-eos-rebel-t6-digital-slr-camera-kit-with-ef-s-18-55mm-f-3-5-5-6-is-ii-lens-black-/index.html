Ideal for beginners looking to expand their photographic horizons is Creative Auto mode.

In essence, with Creative Auto mode, you can experiment and learn more about photography while still taking stunning photographs.</p>

<p>Creative Filters including Toy Camera, Fisheye and Miniature Effect help you capture everything with a new perspective.
The EOS Rebel T6 camera allows you to capture images with a new perspective. The camera features five different creative filters for still images: Grainy B/W, Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Miniature Effect and Toy Camera Effect. Each filter alters the mood and feel of any particular scene, allowing you to create photos with a fun, distinctive flair.</p>

<p>Auto White Balance provides “white priority,” adjusting for the warmer tones under tungsten lighting.
Have you ever taken a photo and wondered why it came out overly red or yellowish-green when it didn’t look like that in real life? Different light sources, whether it’s the sun or a light bulb, can affect the colors you see in a photo. With Auto White Balance, the EOS Rebel T6 camera automatically adjusts the white balance according to “ambience priority,” which retains warm color tones to help maintain the mood of the shot, or “white priority,” which eliminates them to help ensure white lighting is neutral in color. You can choose between these two settings to make sure your image looks how you want it to, even under different lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses.
The EOS Rebel T6 camera is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup. Unlocking a new world of possibilities, these lenses range from ultra-wide angle for grand, scenic landscapes, to super telephoto which can help you capture sports, wildlife and more from afar. Each Canon lens employs advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to help deliver phenomenal performance in virtually all facets of the photographic process. Numerous lenses feature Canon&rsquo;s sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer technology to minimize the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS Rebel T6.</p>

<h5 id="a-perfect-beginner-s-dslr-in-a-small-and-lightweight-body">A perfect Beginner&rsquo;s DSLR in a small and lightweight body</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BUILD QUALITYTo start off this review, let’s first take a look at the build quality of this lens.The first thing you’re going to notice is just how small this camera is for a dslr. The T6 is one of the smallest DSLR’s you can buy from Canon and pretty much any company for that matter.But to me, that’s not a bad thing. Being a very lightweight camera can sometimes mean you’re more inclined to pick it up and take it out with you, rather than being worried that’s it’s going to be too heavy.On the top of the camera right here we’ve got all of the buttons that’ you’d expect to see on a beginner dslr and also this mode dial which allows you to select the mode you want to be in.Of course you’ve got all of the basic beginner modes, like sports and portraits etc, but also aperture, shutter and manual modes for when you want to get a little bit more advanced.The buttons on the back are actually pretty nice. I would have preferred to have had the menu and display button on the top however as I use them pretty often.So overall the camera’s build is good for what it is, a lightweight dslr, but i’d always be a little bit careful with this type of body.Oh and guys if you want to see some sample images I’ve taken with the Canon t6, i’ll put a link in the description box below under this video and you can check them out.LCD SCREENSo let’s turn this camera around now and talk about the screen.We’ve got a 3 inch screen on the back which has 920,000 dots and after testing it out for a while, it actually looks pretty good.Even in bright daylight it was actually pretty easy to see.It is however missing something that I really do like to see and that’s an articulating screen.Whereas on cameras like the Canon t6i and t6s, you can swivel your screen around to get better composition, with the t6 your kind of forced to take the photo even if you can’t see the screen.And that’s a bit of a pity to me and something I would have liked to have seen. I also would have liked to have seen a touch screen on the back of this camera, because they’re especially good for beginners.The screen itself is actually pretty nice, but i’d like to see those improvements made in the next camera.MENUSSo let’s quickly talk about the menus on the T6.If you’ve ever used a Canon camera before you’ll feel right at home with the menu system. It’s incredible easy to get around and change the settings you need.A little tip is that if you switch the dial on the top to manual mode, you’ll get a lot more settings that you can change which can be great.Again it would have been nice to have a touch screen to make it quicker to change the settings not eh fly, but this little d pad right here isn’t too bad and it’s pretty responsvie.So overall the menus are good, but make sure to check out more of the fearless in manual mode.WIFI &amp; NFCSo one of the new inclusions to the Canon T6 is wifi &amp; nfc.So essentially what this allows you to do is connect your camera to your phone and do a number of things like transfer your photos and also get a live view of what your shooting.To me this is the perfect camera to have this feature, because it’s targeting a younger generation of users who love to share their photos on instagram and Facebook.It was pretty easy to setup the wifi, but not as intuitive as the 80d that i tested a few weeks ago.BURST MODE &amp; AUTOFOCUSSo let’s talk about the burst mode of the Canon T6.So essentially what this means is how fast the camera can take photos in a row per second.The Canon T6 isn’t super quick and can only shoot 3 shots per second.Now most of the time when you take a photo you’ll only be taking one shot anyway so it won’t make a big difference, but if you want to take some photos at a sports game or of a bird, this might not be the best camera for you.Autofocus in stills mode is actually surprisingly good, it’s snappy and should be fast enough for most situations. Now the lens that comes with the camera isn’t great, and is noisy in autofocus, but if you can get passed the noise, which sounds bit like a bee, it’ll work pretty well in well lit situations.VIDEOSo let’s talk about using this camera for video.It’s pretty basic for video and will be fine for day to day videos.Unfortunately though the autofocus in video isn’t great.The lens that comes in the kit with the t6 isn’t an stm lens, which means it’s not going to have smooth and responsive af in video mode.My tip would be to switch it over to manual focus o the lens and then just shoot like that.One thing howver though which was good to see is that we have full manual control over our video and audio settings.Where as on some older rebel cameras, you could only shoot in auto mode, the t6 does allow to have some manual control. We are missing a microphone jack though unfortunately, so if you are in need of some better audio, I might advise looking at the t6i and t6s.PRICE &amp; VALUE FOR MONEYSo let’s talk about price and more importantly value for money.Now the T6 comes in at $549, which is one of the cheapest DSLR’s you can buy on the market today.You also get a lens with that so all you need to get up and running after that is an sd card and you’re good.To me it’s not a bad price, but there are definitely some very competitive options that I might look at, for example if you pay just a few hundred dollars more you can get a Canon t6i which is very good camera.-So overall the Canon t6 isn’t a bad little camera, and for beginners, it’ll be a lot of fun to learn on. If you’ve never owned a dslr this is a good camera to learn on, but if you want to go a little further with your dslr, I’d definitely be looking at a camera like the Canon t6i or t6s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a semi-pro photographer. I have a full frame camera that I use for professional shoots which I love dearly, however I wanted an &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; camera that I could take everywhere and not be devastated if it gets stolen/broken. Also, I wanted a camera that I could hand off to someone else (like my son or husband) without fear and one that they will actually be able to use. This camera fit the bill perfectly! So a few questions you might have:Should I get the T6 or T5?They are basically the same camera. The only difference is that the T6 has wi-fi and has a Digic 4+ processor whereas the T5 has just the basic Digic 4 and no wi-fi. To me, the wi-fi was not a feature that I would use at all. I take so many photos that transferring them over wi-fi would be a joke. However, the fact that the Digic 4+ is faster and better was what prompted me to go with the T6. Plus, the screen in the back has a better resolution. However, if these features are not a big deal to you, the T5 does present a huge savings and it&rsquo;s basically the same camera.Does it come with software?Yes. But for some reason they didn&rsquo;t include it in the box, nor do they really mention it prominently in the instruction book that comes with it. The software is Canon&rsquo;s Digital Photo Professional (DPP) which is a raw image processor. It comes with a bunch of other software as well and they&rsquo;re pretty powerful/useful. You have to go on the Canon&rsquo;s website to download all this.Does it come with a manual?You would think the answer is an obvious &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but actually, no. It comes with a quick start guide that tells you how to use most of the automatic features and how to get started. The guide is great for beginners as it really breaks things down to basics. But you do not get the full camera manual. You have to download that from Canon&rsquo;s web site. (Which is a shame)Should I get this camera?I think if you&rsquo;re a beginner and want to explore photography, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this. There are so many guided automatic modes that gently help you and the photos from these auto features actually come out really well. There&rsquo;s full automatic where the camera does everything, to semi-automatic where you control several things but the camera does the rest. There is shutter and aperture priority where you want to control most things but still need a helper for aperture or shutter speed. And then there is full manual for when you feel ready to control all things the camera is capable of.When I&rsquo;m ready to upgrade, what is the next step?The next step to is to get the 50mm 1.8 lens. This will enable you to work with lower available light and give you some awesome background blur. And it&rsquo;s probably the most affordable lens you can possibly buy.All around great camera for a beginner, enthusiasts, or a pro who needs something smaller and lightweight.</p>
