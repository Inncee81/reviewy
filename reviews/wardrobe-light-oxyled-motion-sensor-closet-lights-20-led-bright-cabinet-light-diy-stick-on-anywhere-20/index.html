<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-tool-box-light">A tool box light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having just bought a large tool chest I was in the market for a top box light. I had purchased a battery operated device that proved defective out of the box so I went looking for something else and this is what I found.In my humble opinion this is perfect for this situation. It has a two position switch that is either on or on motion sensing mode.I used the magnetic sticker strip provided to mount it to the underside of the top chest lid. It simply works perfectly. When I open the lid the light comes on. When I close the lid the light goes off in a few minuets.This has a built in rechargeable battery and included USB charging cable. Thats right you don&rsquo;t need to buy batteries either. I was concerned with the size initially and thought it might not be bright enough but it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This light really performs, just what I needed.Coming out of my bedroom into a dark hallway it lights up everything.Actually more than enough light.It does not come on in the day or even in low light.The side of the light is flat, you can just set in on a shelf if you don&rsquo;t want to mount it, what I did.I&rsquo;m not sure how long the battery will last, I just got it today, easy recharge with provided USB Cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-but-doesn-t-hold-a-charge-well-after-some-months-of-use">OK but doesn&rsquo;t hold a charge well after some months of use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first I loved the product but after 2 months of use I find that it doesn&rsquo;t hold a charge as long. I use it in my closet so it probably turns on at least 2 times a day. When I first got it I was charging it every 10 days or so, and after these two months of use the charge is running out after 2-3 days&hellip; Other than that I think its a fine product, the magnet strip that it comes with is great and its good solution for a place that needs light but has no plugs nearby.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="almost-perfect">Almost perfect..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent idea and works great. Wide spread of bright light. Just wish the switch was OFF-AUTO-ON instead of OFF-ON-AUTO. Trying to turn it on in the dark, fumbling around is difficult. Seem to always go past ON. The magnet mount thing is excellent. Better than I hoped. About to order another one or two. I can mow the grass at night now! haEDIT - March 16, 2017 - Based on the above review (unchanged) the company sent me a refund. No idea why. Glad they&rsquo;re reading these reviews and want to help. But it&rsquo;s not 5 stars or bust..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-lights-great-for-work-and-home">Amazing Lights! Great for Work and Home!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so as my spouse would say, I am a flashlight/LED light fanatic. What can I say though, I love these lights and this version is so much better than the original! It has 20 LEDS where my first ones only had 10. Also has the motion sensor or a constant on.Now let&rsquo;s be honest, I didn&rsquo;t get these for a wardrobe&hellip; I got them for server rack lighting at work. AND they are amazing! Whither I need them constantly on, or just the motion sensor for a short time, works great and lights up the rack beautifully.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-bright-and-don-t-eat-batteries">Really bright and don&rsquo;t eat batteries.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these for inside a gun safe. I like the fact that are rechargeable via USB. I had several others that were NOT rechargable before that I had put under kitchen counters and another gun safe. They ate batteries like a kid eats candy. This will allow me to recharge as needed. I read others having problems with the USB ports in the lights coming loose. I have little plugs that stick into the ports and magnetically connect to USB cables so this will not be an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lighting-problem-solved">Lighting problem solved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write reviews all that often but I&rsquo;m making this one a priority. These are hands-down the BEST and brightest rechargeable lights I&rsquo;ve come across. We&rsquo;ve got very deep cabinets and needed lighting inside the kitchen cabinets. After trying tap lights and then the battery operated lights these solved the problem and then some. The fact that they are motion sensing is AWESOME! Now we just open the cabinet and viola! So far they are still operating on the original charge too! Very impressed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-thing">Love this thing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s works exactly how you would imagine. A bright led bar that turns on when you walk in and turns off when you walk out.Depending on how much you use it I believe the battery life is fair.. it&rsquo;s will start to dim on its own when it&rsquo;s gettin lower on charge (under 35% maybe) .. you may not notice it right away so it&rsquo;s good to charge it every now and then before the battery indicator comes on&hellip; just to keep get in the full amount of light possible</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-great-product">Overall great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bright light. Sensor Works great. Overall great product for temporary lighting solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love these</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-useless-after-a-few-months">Battery useless after a few months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought two of these, one is working fine, the other&rsquo;s battery is nearly useless after a few months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-star-time-and-money-saver">5 star, time and money saver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>super ! Great solution for dark closets, under kitchen cabinet shelving, under the kitchen sink, inside of the armoire door, top of the cellar stairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exceeded expectations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bright-light">Bright light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i threw this light in a safe temporarily. It is nice and bright</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-light">Great Light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As advertised, great light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="update-replacement-units-working-fine">Update: Replacement units working fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: The company sent replacements, and they are working as expected. Highly recommend the service provided by the seller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-dud-one-working">One dud, one working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two. One works just as you&rsquo;d expect. On the other one, the motion sensor only works once in about 30 times I wave my hand in front of it. Totally useless for my purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-that-they-can-be-re-charged">Love that they can be re-charged</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far a five star product. Ordered two. Both work well. One in my pantry and one under my kitchen cabinet. Both charge and hold up well.</p>
