<h5 id="love-vornado-hope-they-never-loose-their-quailty-because-they-have-a-great-rep">LOVE Vornado Hope they never loose their quailty because they have a great rep!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love LOVE LOVE this fan serious this is my third product from them. I buy their fans when I need one because I know they have the power for a strong breeze to reach across the room are only as loud as that 20$ fan from Walmart. I have one in my living room, office and bedroom, One on each side of the bed because we both like direct wind without it hitting the other person first.Seriously buy these. BUT know that cleaning can be hard to get the fan apart, you have to unscrew some small screws then pry the clips apart from the motter case which was hard I had to position a Flathead in each clip to get it off, I have arthritis but even still. I will say the only other thing is because will the screws for the base where the legs are they strip Really easily, like I said I have bad arthritis (20oz pop bottles I need help opening) Not to mention I know to carefuller not to strip screws. These striped while the fan was in use just by moving it room to room, only 2 are left that hold and only hold for a few days before vibration loosens them. I had this start to happen about at 6 months. But the fan is still totally usable just a little jankey now. NI would just go buy some replacements but finding the right length with the right width will be hard. I haven&rsquo;t seen a way to buy replacement parts and for a 3$ part vs a 80$ Ill just keep using it</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-vornado-683-medium-pedestal">So far so good. Vornado 683 Medium Pedestal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this for bedroom. Used it for first time last night. Like that it is smaller than most pedestal fans and won&rsquo;t be tripping on the base ( it&rsquo;s all about the base about the base)it looks nice as far as fans go. The really cool looking fans are $200 + and I hesitated for a long time just to spend $80. A lot of money for me. Assembly required was easy as far as that goes too. Set it about 5 feet from bed and after setting it just right to blow on me (hot natured ) very happy w/ results. There is a very narrow ratio of wind that blows right on you but VERY surprised how much the circulating of the air really cools the room down. I am used to a box fan for the white noise and air circulation and wasn&rsquo;t sure @ first if this was gonna work but willing to give it a couple of weeks to adjust to a different fan noise.Box fan took up more space , because of the set up of bedroom we had to set it up on something , too close to the wall and it was blowing too much on him ( cold natured ) Never really did like the look of a box fan. They are better suited to me for use in garages and studios.First turned it on high and didn&rsquo;t seem as high as the medium on the box fan but when I turned it off I realized it was pretty loud ( in a good way ) There was also a faint ascending hum that I thought..uhh no ?? this is gonna keep me awake but after a couple of hours I didn&rsquo;t even notice it. Just heard the soothing white noise of the fan wind. Still hear the hum a little sometimes but not enough to be annoying.You can tilt the fan way up. Also down (but not so much ) Turn it side to side by grabbing the pole. Never have paid this much for a fan but am glad I splurged ( I am totally worth it ) If anything happens to change my mind I will get back to ya w/ more details.</p>

<p>Love it. A little louder than expected and a little less powerful than I thought, but one of the better fans out there.</p>

<h5 id="great-seller-fast-delivery-and-awesome-fan">Great seller, fast delivery and awesome fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great seller, fast delivery and awesome fan!!! I live in Texas&hellip;.Houston area to be exact where it is very hot and very humid. In May/June we were and are already having temperatures in the high 80s, low 90s and with the heat index it feels like the temp is around 98-105. My ac died on me and having this fan plus a smaller one to blow directly on my face from the opposite direction is keeping me cool. This was the best purchase I have made in a long time!! I knew when it said that the fan has a 5 year warranty that it was going to be an extremely well made fan that works really well and it does exactly that!!</p>

<h5 id="poor-value-there-are-better-fans">Poor Value; There Are Better Fans</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had better Vornado fans. This one is very small; if you live in a space any bigger than a large studio or small 1-bedroom, you&rsquo;ll be unhappy with it. It doesn&rsquo;t extend high enough, leaving it too short to do much above waist-height (I suppose I could set it on a box, but it would likely fall); the cord is too short; the fan head itself is quite small. I&rsquo;m disappointed and feel it is not worth what I paid. I had a Vornado stand fan years ago that was amazing; this one is not. (Also, go to fakespot.com and paste in this page&rsquo;s URL. The five-star reviews for this fan are not especially reliable.)</p>

<h5 id="vornado-knockoff-maybe">Vornado knockoff maybe &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited when I got this, my second Tornado. So nice to put together, very turnkey. Totally overpaid for a pedestal fan but it was going to be worth it &hellip;Long story short:Setting 1: weak potatoes, no windSetting 2: loud enough to wake the neighborsI have a same-looking, almost-same-costing vornado that I bought for work that I love, but brought home because I liked it so much. I&rsquo;m just going to get a nightstand and bring it into the bedroom. That particular model, which is the exact same size is CFM high and DBL low &hellip; I&rsquo;ll be returning this model. Super disappointed in this model.</p>

<h5 id="died-in-4-months-spend-your-money-elsewhere">Died in 4 months! Spend your money elsewhere!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the Vornado Pedestal fan in April of this year. I used it intermittently on the lowest setting during the summer time to move the air around my living room. As of today (August 14, 2017), this thing has stopped working. I swapped out the fuse inside the plug and it&rsquo;s still inoperable. For an $80 fan, it moves barely any air at the lowest setting. For comparison, I had went out and purchased a Home Depot fan (it&rsquo;s a Honeywell HT-90 clone) at roughly the same time for my guest room. The HD fan has been working like a champ. I&rsquo;ve kept it on longer than I have done with the Vornado. The lowest setting moves WAY more air than the Vornado does. The best part was the HD fan costs only $15 (well, $16 and some change if you count tax). I&rsquo;m contemplating if I should go through the trouble of sending the Vornado in for warranty repairs. At this point, I may just eat the lost and buy more HD or Honeywell fans in the future.</p>
