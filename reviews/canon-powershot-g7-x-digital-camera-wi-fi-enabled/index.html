<p>Serious Imaging Power in a Compact Camera</p>

<p>New 1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor
Larger than the sensors widely used for compact cameras, the PowerShot G7 X camera&rsquo;s new 1.0-inch sensor achieves a beautiful balance between high sensitivity and high image quality. The sensor is able to collect more light in a shorter time period without the overflow that causes blown-out highlights. This means better detail and more subtle image quality, with rich gradation even at high ISO speeds all the way to 12800. A high signal-to-noise ratio delivers minimal noise and distortion with breathtaking dynamic range, particularly notable in bright areas. And photography enthusiasts will appreciate the changes in image processing for the PowerShot G7 X, which include target exposure value and contrast characteristics of highlights. Thanks to this change, dynamic range in bright areas is expanded with gradation attributes that are similar to EOS. Also, by changing the exposure index standard, it is possible to shoot at almost the same brightness with the same aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings as EOS. The PowerShot G7 X natively captures images in the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is the same as Canon EOS SLR cameras. The camera&rsquo;s image creation technology was designed with post processing in mind, and features an Aspect Ratio function, enabling RAW image capture in both 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios while maintaining the same angle of view.</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Canon DIGIC 6 Image Processor
The PowerShot G7 X is powered by the latest iteration of Canon&rsquo;s proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which takes still and video image quality to a beautiful new level. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that&rsquo;s exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G7 X, powering full resolution high-speed continuous still shooting (even in P, Av, Tv and M modes) and the advanced star shooting modes. The processor allows for MP4 video recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. The new processor also supports an MF Peaking function, giving you a pro-level focusing tool.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM
The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen, whether the light is cooperating or not. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G7 X: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with exceptional clarity and detail.</p>

<p>Advanced Optics for Sophisticated Images
f/1.8 (W) – f/2.8 (T), 4.2x Optical Zoom (24mm–100mm) Lens
The remarkable new lens on the PowerShot G7 X camera takes full advantage of the camera&rsquo;s large sensor, giving your photography a wide range of expression. With a very bright aperture value of f/1.8 at the wide angle and f/2.8 when fully zoomed to a factor of 4.2x (24mm–100mm), this lens not only puts more in your frame, but is equipped to capture an incredible variety of situations with artistry and precision. Equipped with a 9-blade Iris diaphragm, the lens lets you achieve a beautiful background defocus with shapes that are nearly round. Capture macro shots from as close as 2.0 in. (telephoto at 1.3 ft.). From a design perspective, each of the 11 glass lenses on the PowerShot G7 X has a multi-layer coating on it, which is similar to the Super Spectra Coating technology developed for EF lenses. These coatings have features like a high transmission factor, ultraviolet protection, resistant surface hardness, and stable characteristics. The coating also maximizes suppression of unwanted reflected light from ghosting or flaring to deliver clear images with high image quality.</p>

<p>Capture More Angles – Even Selfies</p>

<p>High-resolution Multi-angle Touch Panel LCD
The PowerShot G7 X camera&rsquo;s LCD screen can tilt up 180°, so taking that perfect selfie is a snap! In fact, the multi-angle LCD encourages creative framing because it&rsquo;s easy to achieve a flexible array of camera angles. Capacitive touch-panel operation feels familiar right away: simply touch to access quick control settings, focus and shutter release right on screen. A resolution of 1.04 million pixels makes the glare-free display ultra crisp and clear, so it&rsquo;s easy to compose your shots, choose camera settings, and review and share your images.</p>

<p>Continuous Shooting Gives You the Shot You Want
Full Resolution Continuous Shooting and High-Speed AF
Powered by the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the PowerShot G7 X camera gives you a seamless, high-speed continuous shooting (up to 6.5 fps) experience that&rsquo;s fully available in P, Tv, Av, M and Auto modes. Shooting and processing are now performed in tandem, reducing buffering time to deliver high shooting speeds. With the significantly higher AF speed, achieving focus nearly the instant the camera is aimed is made possible. With no separate mode setting and no reduction in image quality, you can freeze brilliant action shots with ease.</p>

<p>31 AF Points</p>

<p>With 31 focus points arranged in an expanded, wide pattern across the image plane, the PowerShot G7 X focuses with admirable speed and precision. Smaller focus frame sizes also make it possible to obtain accurate focus on small subjects. The PowerShot G7 X also supports 1-point and Touch AF.</p>

<p>Simply Tap to Connect</p>

<p>Built-in NFC (Near Field Communication)
The PowerShot G7 X camera supports NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, eliminating the need to manually find and open the Canon CameraWindow app** on your mobile device. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android™* device, and the CameraWindow app will launch automatically for remote shooting and quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn&rsquo;t been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically.</p>

<p>Take Control of Your HD Video
Canon Full HD Video with Manual Control
Whether you&rsquo;re creating artistic film clips or capturing special occasions, the advanced video capabilities of the PowerShot G7 X camera will get them the attention they deserve. Incredibly realistic 1080p Full HD video is recorded at 60 frames per second with stereo sound in convenient MP4 format. Video is smooth and richly detailed even when played back on a large-screen HDTV via the camera&rsquo;s HDMI output. The MP4 format&rsquo;s small file size lets you fit more on a single memory card, and makes downloading and sharing quicker and easier. In keeping with the camera&rsquo;s sophisticated capabilities, Manual movie mode is also available. Adjust Av, Tv, and ISO speed – you can even select focus points by using the touch panel LCD screen – either before or during video capture to express your vision your way in a wider variety of situations – all from a compact that fits in your bag.</p>

<p>Apple iFrame®
The PowerShot G7 X also records video in the Apple iFrame® format, a computer-friendly standard that speeds up the importing and editing of videos. The format keeps file sizes small, so uploading or e-mailing high-quality videos is quick and easy. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, so you won&rsquo;t need to make time-consuming conversions that can degrade quality.</p>

<p>Optimal Image Stabilization in Any Situation
Intelligent IS
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot G7 X camera – even in low light without using a tripod – because it is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation, allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Control Designed with Photographers in Mind
Convenient control ring, exposure dial, and mode dial provide intuitive manual adjustment
Thoughtfully designed controls distinguish the PowerShot G7 X camera as the first of its line, and will satisfy even advanced photographers. The front control ring makes easy setting changes possible, with customizable zoom, Tv and Av assignments. A two-layer exposure compensation dial is easily accessed from the secure, concave thumb grip, and keeps pace as you quickly and actively create images. A mode dial and dedicated Movie button – as well as two customizable functions buttons on the back of the camera that you manually set to gain easy access to some shooting modes and functions – all contribute to the camera&rsquo;s quick, convenient operability.</p>

<p>Capture the Night Sky Like Never Before
Star Shooting Mode
Starry skies were formerly out of reach to all but experienced SLR camera users; however, star shooting modes on the PowerShot G7 X camera make these wonderfully impressive images accessible to all. With just a tripod and simple settings, you can capture exquisite Star Nightscapes, Star Trails, Star Time-Lapse Movies and Star Portraits. In Star Portrait mode, the camera consecutively takes two shots of the subject, plus one of the night sky, and then merges them into a single image, creating beautiful portraits with a starry background. The modes can be performed fully automatically or with manual controls for extra versatility. Support functions including Night Display, Color Adjustment and Star Emphasis make any starry sky easier to capture.</p>

<p>Additional Features
HDR handheld (no tripod required)
Although the PowerShot G7 X camera has been designed with an expanded dynamic range for excellent capture of bright areas, high contrast environments can be further controlled with High Dynamic Range shooting mode. In this mode, the camera will shoot three different exposures in succession (underexposed, overexposed and normal) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa, resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. The camera allows you to use this mode without a tripod, and features four sub-modes in addition to Natural – Art Standard, Art Vivid, Art Bold and Art Embossed – which provide striking effects that add to the creativity of your compositions.</p>

<p>RAW
As with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot G7 X camera uses a 12-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural gradations. The PowerShot G7 X lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon&rsquo;s powerful bundled software. The camera also allows you to record in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now, in RAW mode, you can even select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 1:1 and 4:5.</p>

<p>ND Filter
The PowerShot G7 X camera includes a neutral density (ND) filter. The ND filter reduces light coming into the sensor, which allows you to set longer exposure times and very wide apertures to create striking photographic effects.</p>

<p>Creative Shot
The Creative Shot mode featured on the PowerShot G7 X camera can help anyone create images with artistic flair. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of Canon&rsquo;s advanced image and scene analysis technology to apply any of the 46 filter options based on the individual scene, subject and exposure. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five unique variations of the composition by cropping it, rotating it, or adjusting its color, tone, and more. The result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I would like to mention that I did not buy the camera through Amazon. I found a very good deal from another store, but I bought the Canon Deluxe Leather Case PSC-5300BK, Canon Battery Pack NB-13L, and Sandisk Extreme SDXC 64 GB memory card through Amazon to be used with this camera. In the end I spent around $750 for everything, which was a good deal.A little background. I have been an avid user of DSLRs since the last 10 years. The main reason I started using DSLRs was not because of the choice of multiple lenses but the features, e.g. bigger sensor, less noise, bigger aperture for blurring the background (nice bokeh), aperture, shutter, iso and manual controls. I owned Canon EOS 400D or Rebel Ti for 8 years or so, but always used a general walk around Tamron 17-50 f2.8 lens with it. I believe this background information is necessary to explain why I sold my DSLR and moved to G7x.A DSLR captures very high quality photos, but one must always consider the size. For me as the years went by, I was taking my DSLR less and less outside. It was just not convenient to carry such a big camera bag around with the huge camera hanging around your neck. In the age of mobile phone which can capture crappy photos (good enough for whatsapp) at the expense of size and weight, carrying a DSLR requires lots of motivation. Maybe it comes with age, or if you are really enthusiastic about taking photos then it might not be an issue, but for me it was a big deal. In the last couple of years, I only took my DSLR for annual holidays, otherwise didn’t bother to use it. On the other hand, I was using my Lumia 920 for taking everyday photos, and was really frustrated by its image quality. At that point I started looking for a high end camera that can provide high quality images at smaller size and weight.I looked at <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> and other mirror less cameras along with cameras with the 1’’ sensor. I quickly narrowed my selection to Sony RX 100 iii. The reviews were excellent and so was the image quality. Before, I was going to buy it, Canon announced G7x and Panasonic announced Lumix Lx100. I discarded Lx100 because it did not have a built-in flash. Even though I take more than 90% of my shots without flash, I did not want to be in a situation where you need the flash, and then you are fumbling in your pockets for one. Finally once G7x hit the market, I spent some time with both RX 100 iii and G7x.Both cameras offer excellent image quality. I knew that with a 1’’ sensor, I cannot expect the image quality at the level of a DSLR but it was a trade-off that I was willing to make for the sake of comfort. Compared to my 8 years old DSLR, it seems that the sensor technology has moved forward a lot and at a lower ISO levels (800 or below) I see no difference between these cameras or EOS 400d. Both cameras offer all the manual controls that I used in a DSLR and provide a good control over the depth of field, thus one can blur the background while focusing on the subject, which was one of my main requirement for any camera. Built-in ND filter is very handy too.Sony has a viewfinder, whereas Canon has the longer zoom and touch screen. Ultimately, the latter features (zoom and touch screen) sold me to G7x. Having the extra zoom is handy, but to select the focus point with a single touch is a revelation, especially if you love to re-compose the shots or focus on any specific part of the scene. I cannot stress how useful this feature is, especially if you want to choose a specific part of the image to be in focus and blur the rest of the image. You can see three examples in the attached images, the focus point changes from the front, middle and to the back. Having the additional zoom range also helps in this regard especially if you want to take portraits.After using G7x, I find the focusing speed to be excellent. I didn’t have any issues with a young kid. Auto-ISO is on the conservative side, which I would like to have more control over. Hopefully Canon can offer some more control in this feature with some firmware update, but I don’t have much hope for it. Battery life is fine, but I always carry an extra battery, just in case. The image quality is really good. Since I am taking this camera with me, I am taking more photos, and the quality in some cases is stunning. I was surprised by the quality of sharpness in some of the images, and the overall quality is easily comparable to my old EOS 400D at the quarter of the weight and size. I always resize my photos to a smaller size, because honestly looking at a 20 MP photo in all its glory on a PC screen, or a mobile phone’s screen is not practical. For a person like me, who never prints a photo, a 4 MP image is equally fine. The movie mode is excellent, especially using the touch screen to move the focus point while recording the movie is a great tool for creative recordings.Another great feature, which is a given in smartphones is WiFi transfer. Unfortunately, the camera does not support my Windows Phone, which is a shame, because I am not going to switch to Android or iOS because of it. I find Windows Phone to be much more elegant and aesthetically pleasing than other mobile OS. Here’s hoping that Canon will support it with Windows 10. On the other hand, WiFi transfer to Flickr is extremely useful. One can use the Flickr app to access the photos, share them on the social media or messaging apps very quickly. I use Flickr upload for the casual viewing and sharing. Having a 64 GB memory card is very useful, as you can wait between the transfers to some permanent storage.Overall, I find G7x to be an excellent camera. It has all the features that I need as I move “down” from the DSLR. The image quality is excellent. You can do flash free photography. Capture images with blurred background, and record high quality videos. To have this amount of control and quality and this size and weight from a camera is truly amazing. It would be very interesting to see how camera companies will take these pro levels point and shoots to the next level.</p>

<p>Finally, a competitor to the Sony RX100 series. I&rsquo;ve been comparing the Canon G7X to my Sony RX100 for a couple of days. Here are some of my observations:* Sony is slightly less thick and weighs a bit less. But both are definitely pocketable.* Contrary to a review I read on Dpreview, the autofocus on the G7X is very fast&hellip;faster (more responsive) than the one on the RX100. I suspect Dpreview may have gotten a defective sample. But this one is lightning fast outdoors, and indoors. Even in fairly low light, the autofocus never hunted. It always snapped into focus instantly.* shot to shot using JPEG is also very fast. I reeled off a dozen continuous shots with no slow down at all. Switch to RAW and the camera slows down considerably. It spends about 1 second to save the RAW file before letting you get another shot off.* The G7X has an automatic lens cover which retracts when you turn it on, and closes when you turn the camera off.<em>. The Dial around the lens can be customized for the feature you want. But not all features can be assigned the dial around the lens. But it lets you assign ISO, MR, WB, Zoom, DR Correction, Shadow Correct, Aspect Ratio and Custom. I left it on the Default which changes the feature depending on the shooting mode.</em> You can also set the Ring Func button on the back. I set mine to metering more (Evaluative, Center, Spot). You can also assign a feature to the movie Record button. But I left mine on Record.* At first glance Picture Quality appears fairly similar to the Sony RX100, which means it is excellent. (But see the update below of direct comparisons of same subject using JPEGs) At this level of picture quality there is little need to carry a DSLR. Thankfully, the G7X does not have the noise characteristic of the G1X Mark II (don&rsquo;t know what Canon was thinking of on that one).* To my eyes the Canon lens is a bit sharper in the corners than the one on the Sony RX100. The Macro shot of the marigold shows off the sharpness.* G7X has a nice touch screen. You can use it to point to the object you want to be in focus. It is very precise. You can also set it to take the picture when you touch the screen (again focusing on the point you touch). It is kind of fun, but I&rsquo;m not used to taking pictures this way yet. Or, you can turn off the touch feature altogether.*Annoyances: the wifi button is too easy to press even though it is recessed. So when putting the camera in my pocket or in a nifty case I have, it is too easy to accidentally turn on the camera by pressing the recessed wifi button. I haven&rsquo;t read the manual yet. So I need to check to see if it can be disabled. The Record button can also be turned on by accident. (But don&rsquo;t they all).Overall a superb pocketable camera. I&rsquo;ll try to add to the review after I&rsquo;ve used the camera more and read the manual.Update October 31==================I did some extensive comparison JPEG shots between the Canon G7X and the Sony RX100. These were all taken on a cloudy day. I took shots at ISO 200, 400 and 800. In shot after shot the Sony was better exposed, showed more clarity and less noise. I was surprised at how much the difference is. You may get different results shooting RAW. But if you shoot JPEG, you are going to get better pictures shooting with the original RX100. I don&rsquo;t mean to take away from the excitement of the Canon G7X because it is an excellent camera. I&rsquo;ll try to post some comparison shots so you can see what I mean. Right now I can&rsquo;t find the &ldquo;add photo&rdquo; button.</p>
