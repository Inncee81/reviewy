<h5 id="a-happy-mouth-and-a-pleased-pocketbook">A happy mouth and a pleased pocketbook.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I have found my almost-perfect, battery-operated, toothbrush&hellip; . AND it has a truly small brush that fits comfortably into my mouth with soft bristles to protect my aging tooth enamel! It&rsquo;s reasonably priced and the cost to replace the brush heads is acceptable. Thanks Philips for considering the &ldquo;other&rdquo; market segment and coming up with a product to suit our needs.NOTE to Amazon: Please keep this product around for as long as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looking-for-aa-battery-based-sonicare-and-this-is-all-that-s-left-sigh">Looking for AA battery based Sonicare, and this is all that&rsquo;s left. Sigh&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some have complained that this model - I bought this one and other colors, four in all - doesn&rsquo;t seem to get your mouth as clean as the bigger brothers. I think it works over all just as well. It&rsquo;s not as premium, for sure. However it uses the same brush heads, and if you &ldquo;brush&rdquo; your teeth in the same manner as an old conventional tooth brush, the sonic motion ,15K VPM, will do just as good a job. Wth the pro models you let the brush do the work, with this lighter weight model, you have to put in more effort.Why am I considering this model over the others? AA Batteries, and costing under $20, that&rsquo;s why. I can go a whole brush head life span on a single set of batteries, and that being rechargeable and replaceable, there&rsquo;s no real theoretical end of life to the body of the unit. I have the e3000 battery operated models as well, but the brush heads are so expensive. The cheap heads magnets are too weak. So the HX3631 models have the benefit of cheaper brush heads and even better, third party brush heads that can&rsquo;t be any worse.I am not through with my judgement, as I may still go back to the e3000, but at least I have options. By the way, it seems the e3000 AA battery model seems to be unavailable anymore, and I have no idea why.</p>

<h5 id="big-improvement">Big improvement!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously had a &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; toothbrush that was not sonicare. I started having issues at the dentist with gum inflammation and lots of buildup. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the issue was because I brush my teeth twice a day and have never had issues before. After switching to this toothbrush, it became so obvious the other toothbrush was barely vibrating and doing anything at all. My dentist and I noticed an improvement only a few weeks after use. I would highly recommend and I won&rsquo;t ever be buying different brand of sonic toothbrushes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bad-quality-two-defective-ones-in-a-row">Bad quality, two defective ones in a row</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is of really bad quality. I ordered one in October 2016 for travel, but didn&rsquo;t open it until last week. I installed the batteries and pressed the power button. It didn&rsquo;t work at all. I changed to new store bought batteries, still wouldn&rsquo;t run. So I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent me a replacement. Guess what, the second one is still defective and won&rsquo;t run at all! I&rsquo;m 100% sure the batteries were installed correctly. So I contacted Phillips directly today and they said the products were defective and would send me a replacement immediately. I have never purchased anything that was defective twice in a row. What are the chances? I would have rated it 1 star, but the two stars are for their customer service.</p>

<h5 id="great-battery-operated-sonicare-for-travel-improved-from-previous-versions">Great battery-operated Sonicare for Travel. Improved from previous versions.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Philips Sonicare for use at home, and I had an older battery operated one for travel.Unfortunately, my previous travel Sonicare broke after a few years of use. It had a flimsy battery cover, and ultimately, it could not hold the batteries in place. I tried to use another brand&rsquo;s battery-operated brush, but it could not compare to how well the Sonicare cleans.I purchased the battery-operated Philips Sonicare HX3631/06, and I really like the form factor. The battery cap seems sturdier, and the handle is a bit beefier than the older model I had. It seems to be able to hold up better to packing/unpacking than the last brush I had. I love that it uses AA batteries as it is easy to carry spares or they are always available for purchase. A simple battery change is easier than to carrying an adapter and always plugging in to charge the brush. Most of all, I love I&rsquo;m back to having the Sonicare feeling of clean after brushing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-happy-buzzy-brush">A happy, buzzy brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My old electric toothbrush finally died and I upgraded to this one for the timer. Wow! Two minutes certainly feels longer than I thought it was. It turns off automatically after the 2 minutes which is nice.The vibration or &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; action I guess they call it does a much better job than my last brush (which had moving bristles but not this high frequency buzzing action).All in all for the price I am way pleased and am upgrading the SO&rsquo;s brush too, even though his has yet to die. I just think it does that much of a better job.The only thing I don&rsquo;t like (and maybe all sonic buzzing brushes do this) is the way it clicks/knocks against my teeth if I am not careful to keep the hard plastic of the toothbrush head angled out of the way. This is sometimes hard to do as you are moving the brush around the mouth.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this battery powered toothbrush</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="discontinue-this-one-and-bring-back-the-old-model">Discontinue this one and bring back the old model.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used the discontinued model for years and only bought this one because the old one was damaged during travel. I hate this thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="superb-for-travel-and-more">Superb for travel and more!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG! I took this on my five week trip abroad and it was wonderful! I might even like it more than my rechargeable main Sonicare brush!!! I cannot recommend it highly enough!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good product thank you</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-it">Like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tooth brush works as expected. I have tried other electric tooth brushes and the Philips Sonicare seems to do a better job cleaning my teeth. It uses 2 AA batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cleans-like-nothing-else">Cleans like nothing else.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much more affordable than the one with internal battery. Now we can all have one and experience the benefit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-like-the-older-model-very-dissappointed">Nothing like the older model! Very dissappointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely terrible! Like others I bought it hoping it was similar to the older model battery powered sonicare which performed just as well as it&rsquo;s rechargeable counterpart.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-maintain-travel-brushe">Easy to maintain travel brushe.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lovely product, but 1 star less because I&rsquo;m missing the 30sec warning beeps which help to time the brushing of the different parts of your teeth in the 2 min total time provided&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-sonicare-powerup-has-power">The Sonicare Powerup has POWER!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sonicare brushes for many years after my dentist recommend (and continues to recommend), the brand. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the price.</p>
