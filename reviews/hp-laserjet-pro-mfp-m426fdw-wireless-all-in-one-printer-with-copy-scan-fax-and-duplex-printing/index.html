<h5 id="great-printer-but-like-all-struggles-with-apple-scanner-worthless">Great Printer but like all, struggles with Apple. Scanner worthless</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the ticket for small and medium businesses. It does everything well, from print to fax to scan. It scans directly to a USB stick or email without using the attached computer. Only disappointment is that we use it with MACs and like EVERY other network attached printer it occasionally get lost. Between Apple and printer manufacturers, they should fix this. Problem is not unique to HP, but be aware as soon as your MAC sleeps the HP printer is lost and must be reinstalled. There is a kludge fix but scanner to laptop does not work.Lately we discovered the extremely poor scan-to-email function. Files that should be 300K turn into 3-4 meg. I bought this principally because USB scanners require a dedicated computer and now I learn that the scanner is worthless. HP get you s..t together and issue a SW update!</p>

<h5 id="great-multifunction-printer-with-one-minor-flaw">Great Multifunction Printer with One Minor Flaw</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This multifunction printer does everything I need - 2 sided full duplex scanning, copying and printing. It only prints in black and white, but that&rsquo;s all I need. The only negative is it isn&rsquo;t set up to do full duplex printing by default. You need to go into the printer configuration (Windows Control Panel - Devices &amp; Printers) and select it or you&rsquo;ll think you have to turn the paper over manually to print both sides. You don&rsquo;t! It seems odd that HP doesn&rsquo;t have it set for duplex printing without the user having to change the printer configuration. Otherwise, this seems like a great printer.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-printer-at-great-price">Excellent printer at great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use 2 laptops and was tired of swapping USB cables from each to my older HP laser. The M426fdw arrived faster than the ETA. Used the supplied HP set up disk. Set up for wireless was a breeze (have two O/S- Windows 10 and Windows 7 Pro). Printing was extremely faint, almost invisible. Chatted with HP support. She was excellent. Determined that the toner cartridge was defective. Received replacement toner next day, 10AM. Wow!This laser is a real upgrade from my previous HP laser, which died after 7 years of daily printing. Having 2 input trays is great - one for the back side of previously printed paper (saving trees) and one for new paper. This printer is very fast with all 3 tasks - printing, copying and scanning. Really, really fast.The HP scanning SW is as poor and cludgy as ever. I recommend third party scanning software.Still cannot believe the price I paid for this laser via Amazon. A full hundred bucks cheaper than from any other source. Unbelievable. Thank you Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="very-fast-perfect-for-home-office">Very Fast - Perfect for Home Office</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned 3 top rated inkjet printer over the last 10 years. After my last one stopped printing, I decide to really think through what I want in a home office printer. I concluded:1) Don&rsquo;t really need color - the color on a home printer not really good enough for professional use. Most of the time I presented on a screen with B&amp;W handouts.2) Didn&rsquo;t want to screw around with ink or paper - which always seem to happen when I wanted to print3) Wanted fast, the old injet seemed to take 5 minutes of head cleaning before it would print.Right out of the box, my toner cartridge is good for about 2,500 pages which is probably 2-3 years of my usage. I can buy one for this printer that could last me for 10 years. I can also load 250 pages, which is small for a shared business printer but huge for a home.The speed is what I love. I can turn it on and in less than a minute I have my first page printed. The text quality is far better than anything my old inkjet could produce.Hopefully, this printer will last me 10 years.</p>

<h5 id="great-mfp-printer">Great MFP Printer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been looking for a new multifunction printer to replace my 8 years old HP LaserJet printer and my old ESPON scanner. The description of this printer fitted perfectly with my needs, but I was hesitated to pull the trigger due to the negative comments around scanning. I finally saw a price point I liked and decided to give this a try, and received the product in two days.Setting up the printer is easy and simple, and I was able to set it up with my WiFi network in a few minutes without reading the manual. I tried out the printing and scanning functionalities, and they worked great! Printing is fast and quiet. Scanning is surprisingly quick and in high quality. I used to spend tens of seconds to scan one page with my ESPON scanner, and this MFP only took 2 seconds! Wow! I also tried out WiFi printing from my iPhone/iPad, as well as from my iMac and MacBook Pro, and this printer just worked!</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-printer-but-has-issues-with-wifi-and-network-connections">Really Nice Printer but has issues with WiFi and Network Connections.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice printer, scanner. But it is a mixed bag getting it to connect to my computers. All of my computers are running windows 10. I can get the printer to connect to my Dell but it refuses to connect to the other computers. Also another thing I really don&rsquo;t care for is that if you hook the printer via network cable you cant use wifi. Since i had so much trouble trying to get the printer hooked up by wifi to my other computers I hooked it up via a network cable. Next thing I know i&rsquo;m getting a message that wifi is now disabled disconnect network cable to use wifi. The main reason I bought the printer was for the wifi connection.To be able to print from cell phones, tablets etc. Maybe there will be a software update in the future to correct this. I have recently downloaded the latest HP update for the printer and still the same problem.</p>

<p>Great, great, great device! Okay, now the nitty gritty&hellip;GOOD:- Printing is fast and can do duplex. Good tray capacity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really great printer. Print and scan work great with my MacBook Air. However, BEWARE that the wireless function of this printer will not work with a 5G wireless router.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="horror-show-for-all-macs">Horror show for all Macs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>HP clearly only put effort into playing nice with PC&rsquo;s which is a breeze to set up. Mac, on the other hand, as listed on other reviews here, is an absolute nightmare.</p>
