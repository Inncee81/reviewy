<p>Beautiful Images and Fast Performance Start Here
12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor
The PowerShot S110 employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.</p>

<p>Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor
The latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the PowerShot S110&rsquo;s image sensor to bring phenomenal increases in processing speed and power, delivering incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. The faster processing speed results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the PowerShot S110 can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like lens correction, special scene modes and much more.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM for exceptional low-light performance up to ISO 12800
The PowerShot S110 gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon&rsquo;s own latest-generation DIGIC 5 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you&rsquo;ll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 12800; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.

<p>Faster Focus and High-speed Shooting</p>

<p>High Speed AF greatly improves focus speed and High-Speed Burst HQ allows for continuous capture at a maximum of 10 frames*** while maintaining superb image quality.
The PowerShot S110 is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s latest advancement in AF technology: High Speed AF. The result of several improved technologies, High Speed AF delivers significantly faster focus speed of 0.2 seconds and a dramatically reduced shooting lag time of 0.25 seconds, for a super-responsive shooting experience that lets you capture every great shot as it happens. The technology also powers the camera&rsquo;s new High-Speed Burst HQ, with continuous capture at a maximum speed of approximately 10 fps. Moreover, images captured in High-Speed Burst HQ maintain the camera&rsquo;s superb image quality.</p>

<p>*** The continuous shooting speed is approximately 10.0 fps.
Optimal Image Stabilization in Any Situation
Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition.
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot S110, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.</p>

<p>Normal  Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid)  Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Set Your Creativity Free
Full range of shooting and recording modes including 12-bit multi aspect RAW+JPEG, as found in Canon DSLR cameras, for the ultimate creative control.
As with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot S110 uses a 12-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural gradations. The PowerShot S110 lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon’s powerful bundled software, and the camera allows you to record in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now in RAW mode, you can even select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 1:1, and 4:5.</p>

<p>Add GPS Data to Easily Identify Images by Time and Location
Record GPS+ data on your smartphone using the free download of the Canon CameraWindow app** and wirelessly add the location data to the images in your camera.
The PowerShot S110 with its built-in Wi-Fi® allows you to tag images with GPS+ data recorded by your smartphone loaded with the free Canon CameraWindow app**. With an easy setup, your smartphone will record location data such as latitude, longitude, altitude and shooting time. Then after you&rsquo;re done shooting, simply transfer the location data to wirelessly add the information to the images in camera. Perfect for organizing albums and vacation photos, this feature ensures you&rsquo;ll always know where and when your images were recorded.</p>

<h5 id="great-gift-to-older-people">Great gift to older people.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it as a gift to my parents, who still use a Sony T700 compact camera that I bought for them 6 years ago. My parents have the problem to navigate the touch screen of the compact camera, because they&rsquo;re not very intuitive on the new techs. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of buying another camera for them which has to be button-oriented and powerful in auto-mode. This camera meets my expectation at the first look.Upon receiving it, I can feel the excellent quality of the camera body and similar features as an entry-level DSLR. I even considered keeping it for myself as a backup to my DSLR. Anyway, the only star deducted is because of the tiny wheel buttons at the back. I find it too difficult to press the buttons without mis-pressing other buttons nearby. A huge design flaw in my eyes.Haven&rsquo;t dumped any photo out from the camera yet but I have confidence about the picture quality from Canon. More importantly, it&rsquo;s the photographer&rsquo;s skill that determines the quality of photo in most cases.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera-despite-change-battery-pack-error">Great camera despite &ldquo;change battery pack error&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE the ability to shoot RAW, the wide array and flexibility of the controls (especially the ability to customize the ring control), and the generally terrific user interface of the S110. Like the S95, I have found this camera to be great for street photography due to its small form factor and ability to shoot with manual focus in shutter priority. The pictures are truly gorgeous, especially if you shoot RAW. Unfortunately, I have to deduct a star because I have experienced the &ldquo;change the battery pack&rdquo; error with fully charged batteries numerous times, and missed some great shots due to this error. Apparently, there is a trick on YouTube using a folded up piece of paper that is supposed to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; this problem. I wish Canon would just fix this well recognized problem and the others that occur with multiple Canon models, but at least I have not gotten the dreaded lens error problem with this camera or my S95. Nonetheless, Due to these reliability issues, I felt compelled to buy the extended warranty through Amazon, just in case, and I always feel it necessary to carry a backup camera. Nonetheless, I still love both the S95 &amp; S110 due to the great controls and results, especially the S110 at this price point.</p>

<h5 id="some-great-some-awful-reasons">Some great/some awful reasons..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You can do a Lot with this camera, almost like a digital SLR. Besides Program, you can do all your settings manual, or set f-stop, shutter speed or ISO &amp; have the camera adjust some or all of the other settings. It&rsquo;s taking some time to get back to that process since I&rsquo;ve just had small digital cameras for awhile, but it&rsquo;s nice Feeling like I&rsquo;ve got an SLR again. Takes good pictures &amp; movies, decent working time on a charge but you have to have a wall plug available for the charger.It does Not wirelessly connect with my MacBook, not sure why, so I do have to use the USB to transfer all my pictures. Another Downside is Posting pictures to an online album. It is a soul-shrinking, one-at-a-time, Interminable process. If you like to quickly transfer all your shots to an online album, this is probably Not the camera for you! I&rsquo;m dealing with it cause I like the adaptability of the photo settings but when I first discovered this, I almost sent the camera back.</p>

The compact flash cards (giant by the standards of SD, let alone microSD cards) only held 12 or 24 exposures (shades of film), but the ability to upload them quickly to the web was such an improvement over film cameras. I upgraded to smaller, higher-resolution cameras over the years, and bought my first digital SLR in 2002 (a Canon D60): which produced fantastic images with almost no shutter lag. But all of these cameras were a bit bulky (especially the SLR).The I bought a PowerShot S95 in August, 2010. What a delight! Small enough to fit into my shorts pocket or in the back pocket of my bicycle jersey, decent (10mp) resolution and zoom, and tolerable shutter lag.The S110 is a nice upgrade to the S100 (which I also owned) and the S95 &ndash; a bit more resolution, a few more features (HDR) &ndash; while still retaining the compact size, easy-to-use controls, and great image quality.I did some side-by-side shooting comparisons between my most recent SLR (a Canon 40D) and the S110 &ndash; and the S110 photos are better (the only advantage the SLR has is zero shutter lag and snapping of a series of shots).I may never use an SLR again.</p>

<p>This S110 is a great camera to have. It is a pocket camera with a lot of features. What I love most about it is its low light abilities in stills and video. I don&rsquo;t like using a flash for indoor shots, and with the S110 you don&rsquo;t need a flash in most cases. High ISO settings are very usable with little noise. Low light video quality is hard to beat - I had a M4/3 with a MUCH larger sensor and the low light video was terrible. The S110 takes wonderful pictures. I have a Canon SL1 but when I don&rsquo;t want to carry that around I use the S110. I debated the need to having 2 cameras, but the S110 is just too good to NOT have as a back up or as an addition to a larger dSLR. If you want a portable camera with great image quality and a variety of settings, this is the camera to have.</p>

<p>Nice camera, very happy with it except the mic is extremely sensitive. If you shoot videos outside, you need a separate Mic source otherwise your video will sound like you were&hellip;</p>
