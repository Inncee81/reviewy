<h5 id="so-many-new-features-full-print-control-on-the-camera">So Many New Features&hellip; Full Print Control On the Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year’s Polaroid Snap was fun— a camera with a built-in printer. But Polaroid has stepped it up big time with a new model. I have the original Polaroid Snap and it is great. It’s fun with instant gratification and about right for the price. But Polaroid has taken everything missing in the lower price point version and added it AND MORE to this new model.What you get in the box:&rsquo; The Polaroid Snap TouchScreen Camera&rsquo;1 Pack of Zink Photo Paper (10 sheets = 10 photos)&rsquo; USB to Micro USB charging cable&rsquo; Magnetic Lens Cap&rsquo; Wrist Strap&rsquo; Instruction Book (a plus because the first model had nothing!)What you may want:&rsquo; More Zink Photo Paper – premium or regular – I suggest the Polaroid POLZ2X350 2x3-Inch Premium Zink Photo Paper Quintuple Pack for Polaroid Snap, Z2300, Socialmatic Instant Cameras &amp; Zip Instant Printer (50 Sheets)&rsquo; An SD card (can be up to 128 MB) – the camera will store about 10 photos without an SD cardThis camera has added so many features – I’m really impressed in the improvements.The top benefits:1. It’s a 13 MP camera – great detail and the ability to ZOOM in and out using the touch screen (in comparison, the Fuji Instax has no megapixels because you can’t save the photo)2. You can take photos or video – (video is also something the Fuji Instax is not capable of)3. It has a built-in flash with the ability to turn it on/off or auto4. It has an LCD display for viewing your photo in advance (as compared to the previous Snap that has a mock-window that gave you a general idea of the picture)5. It has a ton of control features including: optional date/time stamp; fun borders, stickers, and effects that can be added right from the camera before printing, photo booth (creates three photos in a row that become a single picture)6. It has been good so far in low light settings. Much more clarity than the original Snap.7. It has a rechargeable battery via a USB to micro USB cable (the same cable you use to do firmware updates) with good battery life.8. I has a burst mode where you can take a series of photos quickly9. It has a tiny mirror on the front for taking selfies so you can at least get an idea if your face is in the middle of the shot.10. You can attach it to a tripod and there is a built-in timer11. It makes noise so you can tell that the photo was taken (although you have control over the volume and can turn it off)12. It has a Bluetooth feature if you want to connect a smartphone to the camera for printing photos. You have to download an app first. I have not been able to get my phone (Samsung S7 Edge) to connect but will continue to try.And the best feature is……13. IT PRINTS RIGHT FROM THE CAMERA! How cool is this. It’s about the same size as other point and shoot cameras but it will print mini photos right from the camera. It holds 10 sheets at a time and they can be purchased as regular photo paper or sticker prints. Instant gratification, personal and private, great for sharing, great for weddings, parties, and whatever. The list goes on.This great feature has been enhanced because Polaroid added this: you can control the print function. On the previous Snap, it printed automatically as long as there was paper inside. But this camera allows you to choose if you want to print AND gives the option for setting the number of prints too.All of the questions and issues that many commented about on the first version have been addressed and more.The drawback to any instant print camera is the cost of the paper, anywhere from 31¢ for the standard paper to 40¢ per sheet for the premium paper (and the size of the package changes the cost per sheet as well). The prints are only 2”x 3”. The quality of the prints is actually one of the downfalls. There are sometimes streaks in the paper, although you can get much better quality print if you upgrade to the Premium paper. As a note, the paper needs to go in with the blue sheet face down.You have the option of taking your SD card out and printing full size or larger prints as well so you lose nothing in your photo control. Firmware updates are easy and instructions are on the Polaroid website. Having your photos to share – other than prints, is a huge benefit over the Fuji Instax. And since the Snap take a high resolution photo, you can print them big or small as well as post and transfer photos electronically. You could easily print a 10x14 with the resolution quality of the digital file.</p>

<h5 id="would-be-perfect-if-i-didn-t-have-to-buy-a-case">Would be perfect if I didn&rsquo;t have to buy a case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this the day it was released (not through Amazon) because I had to have it THAT DAY. :) I&rsquo;m all about instant gratification. I had purchased the Polaroid Snap a few days before that, but was still on the fence about it and was considering returning it. I had a few issues that I wasn&rsquo;t nuts about with the original. My biggest problem was the cost to print and not being able to control which pictures print. When I saw that the new Polaroid Snap Touch would allow you to choose the pictures to print, and you could even edit them from the camera before you printed, I was sold.For the pros - this camera is easy to use. It prints pictures immediately from the camera. My kids think it&rsquo;s the greatest thing ever. It was easy to set up and to work taking pictures. Being able to choose which pictures to print is a huge money saver over the snap, because each picture will cost you about 50 cents to print and you don&rsquo;t want to be wasting paper. It&rsquo;s easy to add pictures and frames, and apply a new filter.The cons - My biggest issue is that the magnetic lens cap keeps popping off, leaving the lens exposed and making it so I have to dig through the purse to find the cap. Also, the flash will pop up when it&rsquo;s in my purse - which turns the camera on. I&rsquo;ve realized that I now need a $20 case for this camera because of the design flaws of this camera. Also, sometimes the touchscreen is not as responsive as I would like it to be.I would love to pull the pictures onto my phone so I could judge the quality but the iOS app hasn&rsquo;t been released yet. I&rsquo;m hoping that is a seamless release and it all goes well.Overall, this is a solid 4 star product. Having to buy a separate case for this takes away a little of the thrill of this product for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The closest thing to an instamatic you can find in the digital realm. The only issue is with the method of turning it off. To turn it off, you press the flash back into the body of the camera. Mine barely catches, and not always on the first try.</p>

<h5 id="bad-bad-product">Bad Bad Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only had it for 4 months and it has a battery problem. The battery charges to 47% and gets super hot. Contacted polaroid, and they basically said, it&rsquo;s not their problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-huge-disappointment">A huge disappointment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed in this camera. We purchased two as Christmas Gifts and had to send both back due to power button failure and the screen freezing. We had to return the pink one twice. Needless to say we will look for a different camera! A good idea but the quality and durability is not there.</p>

<h5 id="broke-in-2-weeks">Broke In 2 Weeks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I prefer the Fujifilm Polaroid camera by a lot. This camera broke within two weeks for me. It&rsquo;s still usable but I would not recommend it if you feel like you drop things a lot or&hellip;</p>
