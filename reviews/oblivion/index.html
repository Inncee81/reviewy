<h5 id="an-entertaining-science-fiction-movie-fans-of-tom-cruise-should-check-out">An entertaining science fiction movie fans of Tom Cruise should check out.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have loved science fiction movies since I was a little tot and my enthusiasm for good science fiction stories continues into my senior years. I initially saw this movie at a theater and liked it so much I bought the DVD. This movie (Oblivion: Starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman) is an interesting story set in the future with Tom Cruise playing Jack Harper whose job is being the only security repairman stationed on a destroyed earth.This movie moves along at a quick pace and when Jack Harper rescues an unknown woman who crashed on Earth his world begins to unravel. Everything he had been told may be a lie as he attempts to deal with reality. I never like to give away every detail because it spoils it for the movie viewer. This movie was interesting and entertaining.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Samurai Soul: An old warrior’s poetic tribute).</p>

<h5 id="enjoyable-science-fiction-movie-with-a-twist">Enjoyable Science fiction movie with a twist.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed the movie, there was a lot of action and the story line is really well done. I love the way the you think the story is one thing only to find out that something else is really going on. Your on a ride with main character played by Tom Cruise as he slowly learns that the world he sees in not what is really happening. I loved the special effects and how they were make you think that building was up there so high.</p>

<h5 id="not-what-you-think-you-should-see-it-anyway">Not what you think. You should see it anyway.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really enjoyed this Sci Fi flick.Technically from an A/V persepective excellent audio, and video quality. Effects are well done. Music soundtrack well matched for the situation. Story is in the future after a calamity occurs on Earth. No spoilers here.Tom Cruise saves the day by finding out truth of what is not what you would expect, or him for that matter. Key references made from the past help bind together his relationship to a key character. Near the end, you&rsquo;ll care too. It is difficult to describe without giving away too much.This is a very good view. A must view borderline. Fun film in the genre.</p>

<h5 id="visually-stunning-full-of-surprises">Visually stunning. Full of surprises</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorites. Full of surprises and you will watch it over and over for different reasons. Visually stunning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-solid-sci-fi-plot-and-stunning-visuals">Good, solid Sci-Fi plot and stunning visuals!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m not a fan of most Tom Cruise&rsquo;s movies, I made an exception and actually bought this one after a Netflix viewing. It&rsquo;s got a great plot with a nice twist at the end of the story, both of which prevent this flick from becoming just another Tom Cruise vehicle showcasing his chiseled good (?) looks. The cinematography is wonderful, full of dizzyingly airborne perspectives of the Earth&rsquo;s surface. The cameo appearance of a famous african-american actor (spoilers!) as a seeming villain who turns out to be a heroic, self-sacrificing figure works well (for once). The sci-fi technology is nicely done CGI imagery that&rsquo;s not too over the top. The story&rsquo;s premise is also believable: this eerie post-apocalyptic world is sparsely populated and its redeemers win the day in a plausible and convincing manner. All in all, this is a visually stunning and intellectually satisfying flick&hellip; even with Tom Terrific as the lead.</p>

<h5 id="visually-stunning-film-that-was-better-than-expected">Visually Stunning Film That Was Better Than Expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beautiful visuals are matched with a somewhat mediocre story, but the whole seemed better than I expected. I wasn&rsquo;t counting on too much based on things I had read about this movie, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. I found that the visual elements were far more stunning than I expected. The future inhabited by the two main characters is bleak, the world appears to have been destroyed by an attempted alien invasion. There are feral human saboteurs that these two try to overcome in order to accomplish their mission, but not all is as it appears. Morgan Freeman gives a great performance, and Tom Cruise plays the science fiction hero as he does so well. Beautiful location shots and excellent CGI blend together to make a movie as breathtaking in its own way as the Lord of the Rings films. There are also a number of nice special features on the DVD that go into the making of the film and its effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tom-still-puts-on-a-good-performance">Tom still puts on a good performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these movies where the world is all the way messed up and you are trying to figure out what those left have been doing with what they have. This is sort of the premise of this one, the main character (Cruise) is a maintenance man of sorts and is just putting in his time till he is done and ready to head back to the rest of humanity. There are robots on the planet that need repair for a multitude of reasons but it also gives him the chance to see all the things that once were of his home planet. He is an efficient team with his opposite sex companion back at home base and the world if good if not a bit bland. When a mystery develops things start to develop and if you are not as dense as me you can likely see the end coming but I am always surprised by movies like this, and I like that.</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-great-movie-oblivion">Highly Recommended - Great Movie - Oblivion</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tom Cruise is my boy&hellip; I like all of his movies, sorry. I grew up with Tom Cruise, the breakfast club, etc., So, I&rsquo;ve been watching his movies forever.Oblivion is a movie that can be watched over and over again. It tells a unique story of a possible future brought on by a war with another alien species.For a time, this alien species is able to control what is left of the planet using clones (Jack Harper -Tech 49), and drones ( Drone 166 etc.,). However, over time, the clone (Jack Harper - Cruise) is beginning to remember things from the past. The more and more he remembers, the better and better the movie gets.Great movie, I do not want to spoil it.. Morgan Freeman is not really a support actor, I think they used him for more publicity. I think Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, did a much better job that Mr. Freeman at creating a contrast between the Good and Bad in the movie.Highly Recommended - Great Movie - Oblivion</p>
