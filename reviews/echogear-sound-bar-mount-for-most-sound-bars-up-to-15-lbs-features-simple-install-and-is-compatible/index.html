<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll fit right in! Universal design and an assortment of hardware allows this sound bar mount to fit with most candy bars. I mean sound bars. Sorry, I wrote this during lunch time.</li>
<li>This is not a daunting task. All you need is your Phillips Screwdriver and you can have this installed in 15 minutes, or half an episode of Family Guy.</li>
<li>Height adjustable to ensure you have that flush look with your sound bar snug up against the bottom of your mounted TV. It&rsquo;s almost like your TV and sound bar are one. Mind… blown.</li>
<li>This sound bar mount loves friends, and it is a good thing since it mounts easily with most TV mounts, VESA Patterns, and is universal for TV sizes and sound bars up to 15lbs.</li>
<li>Are you sick of one direction…. Sound? We are as well. With the ECHOGEAR Sound Bar mount, sound travels in the same direction as your TV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wanna hang with us? The ECHOGEAR sound bar mount allows you to hang your sound bar below your TV to maximize your TV viewing experience. Unlike other solutions that require you to drill additional holes in your wall, this mount attaches directly to your wall mounted TV. It is height adjustable, so you can bump that slick sound bar right to the bottom of your TV, has a universal design, and holds up to 15 pounds. Luckily for you, it works with most sound bars, and has built in laser beams. One of those is a lie. Choose wisely, choose ECHOGEAR (Too Cheesy? Deal with it).</p>

<h5 id="solidly-build-flexible-for-any-sound-bar">Solidly build, flexible for any sound bar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well built, and echogear&rsquo;s email support is super fast.Tip for others: When I followed the instructions, it appeared like the horizontal bars wouldn&rsquo;t accommodate my soundbar. What the manual implied, but isn&rsquo;t so is that the vertical bars have to be level straight. In fact, you can just swing them out at angles, something obvious that echogear&rsquo;s super-fast email support pointed out to me (providing the attached diagram)!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-sound-bar-mount">Awesome sound bar mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an Echogear full-motion TV mount which is great in itself, but then you add this sound bar mount and it gets even better! This mount will allow you to position the sound bar snug against the bottom of your TV for a seamless look. What I really love about this is when you swivel your TV to the right or left if you need to change the viewing angle, the speaker follows. The installation was simple and it looks to much nicer than having the sound bar mounted on the wall below the TV.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-bar-mounting-brackets-unfortunately-they-don-t-work-with-full-motion-kanto-fmx2-tv-mount-and-a-vizio-38-sound-bar">Great Sound Bar Mounting Brackets—Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t work with Full Motion Kanto FMX2 TV Mount and a VIZIO 38&rdquo; Sound bar.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to like this bracket and give it 5 stars, I really did. They&rsquo;re solidly built and have none of the flexing that other flat brackets have.• I could even get it to fit the holes on the VIZIO 38&rdquo; Sound Bar (31&rdquo; apart) if I angled them out from only the bottom mounting holes on my older Samsung TV.• And used spacers to get them up and over the bottom &ldquo;ledge&rdquo; on the TV. (I understand the company has adapter parts to go over the &ldquo;ledge&rdquo;.• What I couldn&rsquo;t get to work was the fit between these Sound Bar brackets and the TV brackets used on the Kanto Full Motion Wall Mount FMX2 that I had also purchased. They would work fine if you have a speaker with mounting holes that are closer together, and the longarm of the brackets could be vertical under the TV mounting brackets. But when you swing them out at an angle from the bottom VESA holes on the back of the TV that are only 8&rdquo; apart, the raised center of these brackets interferes with the TV mount brackets and there is no way to make everything stable. • Especially since I had to use the spacers as well.Simplified description:Holes on the back of the TV are 8&rdquo; apart.Holes on the bar speaker are 31&rdquo; apart.You have to angle these brackets from the bottom holes on the TV to reach the holes on the speaker.This Echogear Mount doesn&rsquo;t fit properly with the Kanto FMX2 Full Motion Wall Mount when angled.I wound up having to use a pair of the ubiquitous flat-boomerang-shaped brackets that are sold on Amazon. Which do flex and swing.• Which bums me out because these Echogear brackets are well thought-out, well-engineered, and strong—and I like them a lot.• They just didn&rsquo;t work with my particular setup.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-with-sono-s-sound-bar">Works well with Sono&rsquo;s Sound Bar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked everywhere to see if this would work with the Sono&rsquo;s Soundbar but couldn&rsquo;t find a reliable answer. Short answer = Yes it will work, however, some adjustments will need to be made.Overall, great product, like the Echogear mount. Its our 2nd Echogear mount. We hung an 80&rdquo; Sharp LED with the full Motion Echogear mount and the Sono&rsquo;s soundbar underneath it!</p>

<h5 id="not-quite-there-so-a-little-disappointed-echogear-i-know-you-can-do-better">Not Quite There, So A Little Disappointed. ECHOGEAR I Know You Can Do Better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have alluded to, using this mount for a Sonos Playbar is not without challenges. Yes there is an issue with the size of the provided fasteners, but I was able to make it work. The two issues/concerns that I have with the mount is that even though it seems well made, it does not have the strength to hold the play bar next to the bottom of the TV. I easily fixed this with a couple of command strips, but that should not be necessary or if it is then the strips should be included. The other issue that I ran into was that in order to use the correct spacer for my 65&rdquo; Samsung TV, the provided fasteners were not long enough. Once again I was able to correct this with a quick trip to Lowes Home Improvement, but there should be a greater variety of fastener lengths included in the packaging. To say that I was a little disappointed would be an understatement as I was expecting the same great engineering and quality as the TV mounts, but the sound bar mount missed the mark especially since you can buy cheaper sound bar mounts and would have achieve the same results. I recommend that ECHOGEAR reevaluates their design and packaging and if they make the proper changes then without a doubt I believe that they will have a product that is on the same level as their TV mounts.</p>

<h5 id="almost-almost-perfect">Almost, ALMOST perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this along with a Sonos Soundbar and Sub. I also bought the Sonos brand Soundbar mount but then decided NO new holes in the wall and this product seemed to fit the bill. Initial impressions was well made and a perfect option. My rating of 4 stars is in place 12 hours after the install and I&rsquo;ll be honest it could go up or down depending on how it lasts.My single and ONLY complaint stems from a combination of the keyslot on the back of the Sonos Soundbar (blame Sonos) AND the included bolts with this ECHOGEAR sound bar mount. The bolts have a small head that allow them to fit into the key slot but also- for reasons I still cannot understand- allow the bolts to rotate at an angle and the bolts to pop through the narrow part of the keyhole slot. Again, cant understand why the head isn&rsquo;t a normal sized and flat to allow it to both seat inside the keyhole slot AND not rotate out. Needless to say numerous unpleasant words were muttered after the 10th time of trying to attach one side of the mount to one side of the Sounbar and have the janky bolt head pop out. 2 person delicate job for that alone.My advice, fix that small issue, address the bolt head and instant 5 star product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-worked-but">It worked but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is ok, solid parts. but I had to modify it to mount my sound bar. No matter how I tried to set it up the holes and slots would not match up with my 55&rdquo; Sceptre UHD TV and my 29&rdquo; Vizio sound bar. I did use some parts from the kit to make it work, but not without adding holes and lengthening slots. I threw away half the kit. The only parts I could use were the &ldquo;L&rdquo; shaped brackets.</p>
