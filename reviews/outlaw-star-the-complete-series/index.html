<h5 id="amazing-blu-ray-release-for-the-perfect-anime-series">Amazing blu ray release for the perfect anime series</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>*this is for the June 2017 NA release of this series*I&rsquo;m reviewing the actual release, because anybody coming here hopefully knows that this is the perfect anime series (unashamed bias).The color is crisp and amazing, it truly brings a whole new life to a show that I&rsquo;ve seen a good 20 times over. On a good 4K tv this release looks outstanding. I just recently watched the anime legends DVD release and this blu ray release is hands over fist the better release. It&rsquo;s actually really cool to see some film grain in the cells that were used, which appear because the definition/scaling.The audio is crisp, detailed, and has amazing room,depth, and panning. The mixing engineer did great work on bringing attention to what is needed while still using great dynamics to highlight ambience and action. Punches you right in the face still.I was a child when I first watched this anime on toonami and it honestly brings back the feeling of watching it that first time, cross-legged in front of the CRT TV. The sub and dub are great. I admitedly always watch this show dubbed first because of nostalgia, and wow! it holds up so well! I will return to review the sub when I do my second watch. This series needed a high definition release and this collection doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. Completely new experience. Amazing !!! The only thing I regret is not getting the collectors edition!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For anyone new to this gem of an anime, Outlaw Star appeared on Toonami almost two decades ago heavily edited. So edited in fact that one episode was cut out entirely, which left many of us wondering (just what the hell is a caster gun and why is it so powerful against a magic user?) This box set, is well worth the cash if you are into late 90&rsquo;s anime that follows the space western genre that was popular at the time in a show like Cowboy Bebop for example. With amazing characters, an outstanding and catchy soundtrack, and an out of the box sci-fi plot twist and story Outlaw Star is an adrenaline fueled spaghetti western set in space that would make anyone who worshiped Han Solo as a kid cream in there jimmy&rsquo;s. So let&rsquo;s get into the story my friends and what makes Outlaw Star an interesting tale:Outlaw Star is set to the backdrop of Towards Star&rsquo;s era a type of Gold Rush in space dictated by lawlessness where three major powers reign supreme: the pirates, the space forces, and of course the outlaws. Gene Starwind, an intrepid young mercenary, yearns to earn enough money to buy a starship of his very own and traverse the stars as a gunslinging outlaw, there&rsquo;s just one problem. He&rsquo;s stuck on a dreary Tatooine archetype planet called Sentinel 3 with his 11 year old techy sidekick Jim Hawking offing small fries and performing odd jobs for the business he runs out of his garage &ldquo;Starwind and Hawking Enterprises&rdquo;. Suddenly without warning (and just like in any heroes journey style story) a call to adventure comes in the form of an revered, femme fatale, outlaw known as Hot Ice Hilda (feminists eat your heart out). Hilda hires Gene and Jim as bodyguards under an alias in an attempt to buy time before a group of space pirates find her. However, it doesn&rsquo;t take long (literally a minute and 30 seconds after they meet Hilda) before Genes shooting it out with Tao Magic users from the Kei Pirates guild. That&rsquo;s right boys and girls pirates in Outlaw Star world are not all burly white men with beards and alcoholism oh no. They come in the form of Asian youngans and old men with creepy space magic and dudes with giant swords that could cut through Bernie Sanders BS.It becomes overly obvious from the heat that Gene and Jim are on no ordinary job and they soon press Hilda for information. Hilda reveals herself to be the wise yet sexy outlaw she is and let&rsquo;s our two heroes in on a little secret. She&rsquo;s stolen the universes most advanced grappler ship built with the brain of the pirates and the money of the space forces. She then reveals the massive case they&rsquo;ve been lugging around to contain a young and very sensitive android named Melfina. If any of you have ever seen Firefly, you will now see one of the big reasons why people accuse Firefly of being a massive Outlaw Star ripoff.Anyways, Gene and Jim leave there lives behind to pursue an adventure with Hilda and that&rsquo;s where the series really takes off. I&rsquo;ll end the summary there as backstory, character development, and nomenclature like &ldquo;grappler ship&rdquo; and Galactic Leyline&rdquo; will be explained further on. So now that you know a little about Outlaw Star let&rsquo;s talk about what makes it great.Outlaw Star follows the old yet still fun to watch over the top action movie aspects that made movies like Commando, Rambo, and Fist of the North Star great. It simultaneously pulls from Star Wars and Clint Eastwood style westerns like Good, Bad, and Ugly and a Fist full of dollars. The characters are not pseudo goody goody&rsquo;s. They are rough and tumbling, heavy drinking, knife wielding, gun slinging, ladies men with a need to get rich quick. The story is not overly complex and fairly easy to understand. The Towards Stars is an established universe. If you would like to know more &ldquo;Angel Links&rdquo; takes place within the same universe.I watched unedited Outlaw Star as a kid. Mowed lawns until I had the cash and then bought the DVD&rsquo;s at a Suncoast (remember those?) Why do I bring this up? For people who are wondering if this is child friendly. My view is, Outlaw Star is a matter of perspective. There is nudity, sexual innuendos, questionable and sometimes even blatantly obvious choices that lead to murder however, this shouldn&rsquo;t scar your kid for life. I watched it alone almost 20 years ago and my parents thought nothing of it. You may not feel the same way about your kids so if you intend to watch this around your children treat it as any other rated R movie you watch in your household. There is one episode in particular (the one Toonami didn&rsquo;t show on prime time TV for obvious reasons) that plays like an episode straight out of any other moe swimsuit episode you commonly see in anime. This episode, while crucial to the plot, is pretty much 90% fan service and nudey shots. It&rsquo;s called Hot Spring Planet Tenrei do whatever you want with that episode however, once again, it does have some plot to it.Lastly, Outlaw Star is dated and it shows. When I watch anime these days I can&rsquo;t help but, notice how far we&rsquo;ve come. This show quite literally changes animation styles at points and fiddles with recycled animation clips and explosive backgrounds at times to move fight scenes along. The reason I give it a pass is because, it&rsquo;s done almost purposely to build suspense much the same way you see an old duel play out in an old western. The protagonist stares at his enemy the enemy stares at him, they scowl and hover there hands over the guns. There are literally scenes like that so if everything up till now is something you will enjoy then buy this Blu-Ray. You won&rsquo;t regret it.I hope this review has helped anyone who reads. This is an amazing anime and you won&rsquo;t dissapointed. Outlaw Star is one of those timeless yet easily neglected shows from early Toonami era that just can&rsquo;t be missed. <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> would Outlaw.</p>

<p>Awesome show but the blu ray is in 4:3 aspect ratio.</p>

<h5 id="great-show-truly-underrated">Great Show! Truly underrated.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic Show if you don&rsquo;t belive me watch the first episode of Firefly, and then watch this shows and realize how similar they are and then you will realize that it inspired one of the greatest live action sci-fi shows. Even if Joss Whedon won&rsquo;t admit it lol.</p>

<h5 id="another-iconic-anime-gets-a-great-re-release-at-a-great-price">Another Iconic Anime Gets A Great Re-Release At A Great Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very appreciated that Funimation has released another former Bandai released anime title years ago and has been released again with both standard dvd and blur-ray discs for anime fans to enjoy. Again also appreciated with the top-notch subtitling that Funimation has where you now have more correctly detailed subtitles on what the original Japanese voice cast are saying during the scenes though that&rsquo;s not to say the Bandai subtitling set was bad but the Funimation set indeed shows more accurately on what the characters are saying. As for the video and audio quality I feel personally that they&rsquo;ve been improved pretty well though not substantially from the earlier released set but the coloring and framerate does seem to show some improvement here and there and the audio is more clearer and sharper too.Of course the big question if you already have the earlier sets should you get this one? and I have to say for the overall quality and price yes you won&rsquo;t be disappointed for doing so. Also it&rsquo;s probably better to get it sooner rather then later before the moronic anime scalpers try and resale this set for an outrageous price and all you&rsquo;re left with is regret for not having gotten the set sooner.</p>
