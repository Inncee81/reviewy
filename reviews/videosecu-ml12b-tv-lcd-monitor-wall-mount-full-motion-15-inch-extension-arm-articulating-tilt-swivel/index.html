<h5 id="i-reversed-my-rating-from-2-to-5-stars">I reversed my Rating from 2 to 5 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I revamped my computer room for better functionality for my family. I installed an 11 foot kitchen countertop onto one side of our library/computer room; see picture (a feat in and by itself). Using a countertop allowed me to create a wireless environment with 3 separate computer stations; 1 PC &amp; 2 Laptops (the LPs are hidden underneath the counter). I then mounted 3 computer monitors above the countertop. To keep costs down, I bought 3 of these inexpensive wall mounting computer monitors arms.For parties, we use the countertop to hold the food. These wall mounted monitor arms allow all 3 of the monitors to be pushed back snuggly against the wall, and out of the way of the food, and potential messes. I like a wire free environment, so all of my computers have wireless keyboards and mice (color coded on the bottom to not get mixed up). This allows them to be easily removed when the food comes onto the countertop. So everything is out of the way including the monitors.But during the week, and regular life, when the kids/family are using the computers for school work, or gaming, or for gathering information from the internet, these wall mounted monitor arms allow for easy adjustment to personal preference… No hassles.When I first mounted these monitors, I’ll admit I had some difficulty making adjustments when using the wrenches that came in the box. I even had some difficulty tilting the monitors up and down. Therefore at that time, I gave these wall mounting arms a rating of only 2 stars. However, I’ve now revered my rating to a 5 star. I&rsquo;ve owned these wall mounted arms for 9 months now, and I&rsquo;ve learned how to make the adjustments, quickly and easily. Also these mounting arms have held up very well; they have NOT sagged down from the Monitor weight. My older I-INC monitor is 24 inches, and the 2 newer Dell Monitors are 23.5 inches They are nice and sturdy and easily move into position as needed. The wall mounts allow the monitors to be spun 360 degrees, although I have only had to spin them 90 degrees one way or the other to watch a cell phone videos that were taken with the phone sideways.Also my kids like to play a racing game called TrackMania - Canyon, and often play it on the center monitor, with it fully extended out from the wall. This arm has had no problems doing so and doesn’t sag. Also sometimes, if there is too much light in the room, they throw a blanket over both themselves and the monitor to block the sun light. The blanket adds additional weight, and yet the support arms have not sagged. I’m very impressed.Other comments:Firstly, I’ve added a smaller rubber bumper to the mounting arm to keep it from marring the wall when fully collapsed against it. Just one side, as when moved to the other side it touches off on the wall opening housing.Secondly I bought the bigger bolts from a hardware store, that could still fit through the wall mounting holes on the bracket. I simply don’t trust bolts and screws from China, as I’ve had some others (not these) break. So an additional 50 cents for bigger bolts could possibly save your $300 monitor from falling.Thirdly, my kids wish the 2 side monitors could be swung over to towards the middle one, so that all 3 could be used for the racing gaming together, for multi-screen gaming. However, the spacing between them is such that when used separately, people aren’t too close and uncomfortable. So if these arm on this product had an additional 10 inch of reach, then they could serve as both (a) separate computer monitors with comfortable spacing, and (b) then be swung over and used for multi-screen gaming.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-cheap-mount-for-small-tvs-monitors">Amazing, cheap mount for small TVs/monitors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to mount my 21.5&rdquo; Asus monitor to the wall. I mounted it on a wood stud wall. I used a stud finder to locate the studs, mapped it out, then drilled 2 pilot holes for the mount. Put the bolts in and got them in. You probably will need a better wrench then the one included, because the included one is tiny and extremely hard to use. However for the price of this mount you really can&rsquo;t complain, and most people have some sort of wrench around anyways (even pliers would probably work). So overall the mounting process was fairly simple. Once it was mounted it felt very secure. It could easily hold the weight it says it can, the thing is rock solid once its attached to the wall. Screwing on the detachable VESA plate to my monitor was simple using the included screws, then I just slid it onto the mount, screwed in the two bottom screws, and pushed the screen where I wanted it. Very easy and simple installation overall. You can&rsquo;t beat this price for this excellent mount for small monitors/TVs.</p>

<h5 id="will-work-but-proper-level-for-alignment-of-multiple-monitors-is-critical">Will work but proper level for alignment of multiple monitors is CRITICAL!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took the risk and bought these cheap monitor wall mounts. I got three of them for around $12 a pop! I knew there wouldn&rsquo;t be much room for error when it came to wall mounting three of these since I needed them all perfectly aligned and straight so my monitors would be of even height. I could have gone for one of the more expensive mounts that had more adjust ability should your monitors not match up on first installation. There is height adjust and maybe some sideways adjustment.These mounts had a little side adjustment but no height adjustment if I mounted these triple mounts one slightly lower or higher than the other. That would leave me with uneven monitors of noticeably height differences. I didn&rsquo;t want that at all. However careful planning of the height I wanted my monitors to be at and the use of a laser level (critical) enabled me to get an almost perfect top alignment of my three monitors. My left monitor is very slightly a teeny bit lower than my middle monitor but it is hardly noticeable and I can live with it. Since as I said it is hardly noticeable.Anyone looking at my monitors would hardly likely see the difference unless they were specifically looking or I pointed it out to them. In other words it isn&rsquo;t noticeable to the point where when you look at my monitors its the first thing you see. My reason for deducting one star was because while these monitors seemed well built they are easily scratched and the paint removed, so be careful with accidentally banging them against the wall or any other metal or solid structure it may ruin their paint job.Other than that I would recommend them if you were on a budget and looking to save some cash from the more expensive alternatives. Just remember if you are installing mounts for more than one monitor which you would like to have in perfect alignment with each other a laser level or some form of level to get you a straight an accurate line for mount placement is critical.</p>
