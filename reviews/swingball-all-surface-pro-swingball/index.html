<h5 id="i-love-that-the-height-is-much-taller-and-the-base">I love that the height is much taller and the base &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had the kids version of this for several years and it finally died. Looked for a new kids version and decided to buy this one instead. I love that the height is much taller and the base is sturdier. Plus, the spiral at the top is longer. Love the racket holder on the pole, too. A great buy. Loved by all members of my family, young and old!</p>

<h5 id="mookie-swingball">Mookie Swingball</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe any of the negative reviews. This thing is awesome!We&rsquo;ve been playing in the family room since Xmas day. It will topple if you get too crazy. But if you can play w/o getting carried away, it does not fall over.My son had taken tennis lessons last spring. This is allowing him to practice his hand eye coordination, front and back swing.Play alone or with another, either way we&rsquo;re having fun. Son will use a paddle per hand and practice with his left and right.Pole parts are metal, the rest is plastic. All solid, thick and sturdy.The storage inside the portable case are perfect. The portability and inside/outside factor are both excellent.If you leave it outside, I&rsquo;m sure it will not last as long - or be as nice. Unfortunately, if you put sand or water in to weigh the base, you lose the portability, which was a big reason for my choice of this product.I have read other reviews that said the ball came lose, it wouldn&rsquo;t stay upright, etc&hellip; These things will only happen if you get a bit out of control (play crazy). You&rsquo;d have to be *EXTREMELY rough to ruin this.The 10 yo, and 4yo are playing daily. I&rsquo;ve played with the 10yo. It is easy to get into it(competitive) and get a bit too exuberant, but if you settle down it won&rsquo;t fall down.Son is playing with it as I write this review. When playing in the house, remember to space it with the ball fully extended so as not to hit anything. And just in case it would fall over in the house, make sure it won&rsquo;t crash into anything on its way down.Awesome gift. Son loves it. Totally recommended to (reasonable) children. * see comment</p>

<h5 id="great-item-horrible-assembly-directions">Great item, horrible assembly directions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a solid toy. The directions are HORRIBLE though. I was so frustrated. The sequence is out of order and things you have are not pictured and things you don&rsquo;t have are pictured. Tip: though the racquet holder is convenient, it impedes play because the rope gets stuck on it. Once you put it on, though, you can&rsquo;t get it off without major hassle, so leave it off from the start.</p>

<h5 id="the-idea-of-a-portable-compartment-is-great-however-it-wears-out-very-quickly-so-we-were">The idea of a portable compartment is great however it wears out very quickly so we were &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The top part where the ball swings around is very poorly made. The one I had as a child had a metal coil instead and the tether really did move up and down. The tether on this one absolutel does not travel up and down in the grooves and just jumps around , causing the tether to wrap around the pole. The idea of a portable compartment is great however it wears out very quickly so we were unable to snap the lid shut to play the games. It would be best to purchase one that goes in the ground and the coil is made of metal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-fun">Awesome fun!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got it for my daughter&rsquo;s graduation party, and it was a hit! Two of her friends have borrowed it for their parties as well. We also took it to a family reunion, where it was enjoyed by all, including their 75+ year old grandma!Giving 4 stars because I do think the clips to hold the top of the base on need reworked. They are kind of a pain to open and close, and come off easily. I could see them being lost.Other than that minor issue, this has been worth every penny!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mookie-fun-for-all-ages">Mookie fun for all ages!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my 2 year old grandson&rsquo;s birthday at the suggestion of his Mom. The base holds the pole up very sturdily even when the bigger kids are really whipping the ball around with the paddles that come with the game! Even the 2 year old can hit the ball as long as the big kids hit the ball softly with him. It&rsquo;s also very portable. Everything fits into the base when the game is taken down. Great for camping or visiting the Grandparents house. Really happy I purchased this!</p>

<h5 id="what-a-good-test-they-enjoyed-playing-with-it-but-the">What a good test! They enjoyed playing with it but the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it for the 10 yr old in the family not realizing that he had invited his football team to his party. What a good test! They enjoyed playing with it but the clamps would not stay on and have broken off. I tried to order parts but they are not available - would have ordered the entire base piece but that is not available either- too bad. If anyone has figured out a solution or a substitute part to fix this, please share.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-and-fast">Fun and fast</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If the ball is not hit properly, the string gets tangled so it&rsquo;s not so easy to play a game between two people. The ball whips around fast and if you don&rsquo;t have good hand/eye coordination, the ball can hit you in the arm since the plastic paddles are paddles and not racquets. I like this swingball for my kids to practice hand-eye coordination and hit forehands and backhands with their tennis racquets.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-clip-holding-the-ball-snapped-after-1-week">The clip holding the ball snapped after 1 week. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The clip holding the ball snapped after 1 week. The ball broke off the string after 1 month. It does not have a clear start point for games and the string gets tangled constantly.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Love it good excersize</p>

<h5 id="awesome-game">AWESOME GAME</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the funnest game I have played in a long time. We had people ranging in age from 4 - 70 playing it.</p>

<p>Fun game but poor quality - tore up after a few days of use. Over the years we have owned two others and they all lasted a lot longer before breaking.</p>

<p>Kids love it and so do I, much better than the one that goes in the ground</p>

<p>The whole family is enjoying this backyard game. It&rsquo;s good exercise also.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-that-instantly-was-a-hit-what-more-could-you-ask-for">Great Product that instantly was a hit. What more could you ask for?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When looking for an outside toy for children, you want a few basic things.First, it must be easy to assemble, which this is, allowing them to quickly start having fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-2nd-one">Love it! 2nd one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love it! Its our second one, the first one lasted over 8 years outside. Great for all ages. Everyone who comes over only wants to play with that game. Get one. :)</p>

<h5 id="fun-but">Fun but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Clips on the bottom container came off and we&rsquo;re lost after the second use. That was highly disappointing for a $50+ toy.</p>
