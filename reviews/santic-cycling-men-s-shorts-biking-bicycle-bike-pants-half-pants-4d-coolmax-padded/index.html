<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="measure-your-leg-band-seriously">Measure your leg band. Seriously.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For some people 1 size up is good, but others might need 2 sizes up. Reason? The leg band is not as stretchy as the waist.While most people know their waist size, it&rsquo;s important to measure the thigh size too. Take out your tape, sit down, and measure the leg band at 6 inches above the top of the knee cap.See my modified sizing chart based on my experience with the 2 sizes I bought L and XL. The lower limit is what will fit snugly without flapping while cycling, and the higher limit is after being streched but not feeling uncomfortably tight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-without-being-overpriced">Great quality without being overpriced!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am 5&rsquo;9, 168 lbs, size medium. After reading the reviews, I bought size L and they fit very well.I use these to train for triathlons and duathlons, usually around 24 miles. They are very comfortable, dry quickly, don&rsquo;t crawl up in your legs, the quality of the fabric and seams are comparable to the top brands (I have a Pearl Izumi Select and I like these better). They also look good. There is an area on the back, close to the wast, that uses a mesh, which is nice because it helps to evaporate the sweat faster. I liked them so much that now I have the red and the blue! I will not be surprised if they become a major brand.</p>

<h5 id="very-comfortable-pants-from-an-up-and-coming-company-great-on-the-budget">Very Comfortable Pants From an Up and Coming Company! Great On The Budget</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like these shorts. For what I paid they are good quality and the padding works. I would expect to see more out of this company in the near future. I recently bought a pair of $85 bike shorts and they are similar to these Santic&rsquo;s. The expensive ones are built out of thicker material and don&rsquo;t stretch as easily. Also there is more padding in the right places. You can see in the pics the padding is thicker on the expensive shorts at the bottom hip bone area. The expensive shorts are on the left and the Santics on the right.However the Santics are OK for medium rides and the padding is adequate. I am not a long distance rider anyway&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.just a recreational rider mostly so these shorts are awesome for 10 or 20 mile rides. I like how they fit but you need to go up one or 2 sizes. I am 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; and 175 lbs. Based on other reviews here I ordered the XL and they fit great. Overall I would say to give these pants a try. They are comfortable, stylish and the padding works. I also use them for running and just general working out, they are that comfortable.</p>

<h5 id="started-off-great-but-lasted-just-over-a-year">Started off great, but lasted just over a year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE 30 JULY 2017:After using these shorts for over a year, I have to save that the 4D chamois has worn out and that&rsquo;s with less than 1000 miles of use. My right sit bone gets bruised/sore after a 18 mile ride. I switched saddles and have a lot of pressure on the perineal area with these shorts. I had a pair of Pearl Izumi Quest Escape shorts that I received from the Vine Program and decided to switch to those. My sit bones feel fine now and the perineal pressure is significantly reduced, even when riding the same distances on back to back days. So I have to downgrade these shorts to 3 out of 5 stars because they don&rsquo;t last very long.Original Review:The 4D chamois is much better than any of Pearl Izumi&rsquo;s chamois, including their Elite/Pro top of the line chamois. The SANTIC chamois is not only thick and supportive, but it provides enough cushioning to make it more comfortable for a longer ride and prevent blisters/chaffing. My Pearl Izumi Quest only lasted 4 years (the spandex material is pretty much dead), so I&rsquo;ll have to see how long the SANTIC lasts.</p>

<h5 id="what-a-deal-on-some-excellent-bike-shorts">What a deal on some excellent bike shorts!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what I needed. I didn&rsquo;t want to break the bank, but I wanted some good fitting cycling shorts and some padding that didn&rsquo;t bunch up and cause problems.For the price this is absolutely excellent. They have the rubber strip around the legs to keep them in place and the padding is adequate. I bought the gel version, which may be too much padding for my needs ultimately, but there wasn&rsquo;t so much it caused problems. For a 50 mile ride it may be overkill, but I&rsquo;m pretty well adapted to my saddle so your mileage may vary. I&rsquo;m going to buy the less padded version right now, why not? They&rsquo;re cheap and they work great!Make sure to read their little blurb about &lsquo;fitment&rsquo;. I bought a large per their recommendation in the description when I usually buy a medium. If I hadn&rsquo;t read their disclaimer and had bought the medium it probably would be too small. So yeah, they look to run small so ordering a size larger may be smart. I listed them as &ldquo;Fit as expected&rdquo; because I followed their fitment instructions and it worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-comfortable-for-6-to-8-mile-rides">Very Comfortable for 6 to 8 Mile Rides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t bought a new pair of cycling shorts in a few years, but these things are extremely comfortable. I&rsquo;m a recreational cycler that gets in about 20mi per week, and these feel really good on my man parts. I&rsquo;m a 36&rdquo; waist and the XL fit perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-item">Quality item</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a single pair of this item to try out for size, quality. I came back for three more immediately after, enough said! I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; and 245 lbs so I had a real concern over sizing. Fits very well and the quality is there with very good padding ,.. you should like this item. I picked up a pair of 3XL for my size- good fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-pad-is-excellent-and-was-very-comfortable-on-a-5-1-2-hour">The pad is excellent and was very comfortable on a 5 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I normally wear a large and ordered the XL size which fitted well except the legs were just a little shorter than I&rsquo;m accustomed too. The pad is excellent and was very comfortable on a 5 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour ride. I&rsquo;ve only ridden in them twice so I don&rsquo;t know how well they will wear but quality of material and stitching seems good. Overall excellent value for money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great riding shorts</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it fitted well at the hip and leg but too big for wirst</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="waistband-not-at-all-sufficient">Waistband NOT AT ALL sufficient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product was as described in the reviews in terms of size/fit &hellip; I&rsquo;m a 32&rdquo; pant/short, but bought a large and it was the correct choice for fit at legs/thighs and&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-to-be-made-well-but-size-chart-way-off">Seems to be made well but size chart way off.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>XL does not = 34&rdquo; waist. I have a 34&rdquo; waist and perfectly fit a Pearl Izumi medium. These XL fit more like a Large in the PI brand so I&rsquo;ve reordered them as a large&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality">Great quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Santic shorts are fantastic. I am getting more of them.Love them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-better-than-this">Nothing better than this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Definitely the best cycling shorts and costumer service all-in-one. The padding on this shorts is enough to make your ride the smoothest ever. I will recommend to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="biking-shorts">Biking shorts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked very well for my husband. He&rsquo;s an avid biker and loves the new biking shorts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-shorts-and-excellent-value">Excellent shorts and excellent value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent shorts and excellent value. These shorts are as comfortable and functional as much more expensive shorts, I&rsquo;m 200 pounds and 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; tall and the large size fit&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job-well">Does the job well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They do what cycling shorts are meant to do &ndash; help keep your precious rear comfortable. I am small (135 lbs, 5&rsquo;10&rdquo;) and they fit well around the legs and only slightly loose&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-shorts-mostly">Nice shorts-mostly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First padded cycling shorts. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to have enough padding in the crotch. Might just be me. Otherwise very nice: well made, nice design (sans padding), good materials,&hellip;</p>
