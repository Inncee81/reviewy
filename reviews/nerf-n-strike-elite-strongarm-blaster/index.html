<h5 id="no-need-to-nerf-this">No need to Nerf this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not ashamed to say that I got two of these so my wife and I can have mini Nerf wars in the house.It is day 3, the house is now littered with spent darts, the living room is no mans land. I am running out of food, my wife has taken the kitchen and fortified herself. Even with the uncanny accuracy of the blaster, she is just too quick. She is not a very good shot, but the fast reload and six shots help even the score.I do not know how much longer I can survive, at least I have the bathroom&hellip;READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-ultimate-answer-for-kitty-obedience">The ultimate answer for kitty obedience.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My cat is a furry little douchebag. Honestly thinks he runs the place. Always walking around on the kitchen counters, dipping his dirty paws in whatever dish or drink he sees fit and leaving a snail-trail of hair wherever he walks. We tried yelling at him, waterspray bottles, other various loud noises, giving him treats when he actually gets off the counters at his own leisure (my wife&rsquo;s dumb idea). Nothing seemed to work.I needed to get old-school on him. Thank God whoever is running Hasbro still lives in the 90s. I can say wholeheartedly that this device did the trick.I shot my wife a couple times to make sure the darts don&rsquo;t really hurt. She confirmed they didn&rsquo;t, and soon enough, it was hunting season.I drank half a glass of 2% and left it sitting on the counter, 30 seconds later he came waltzing on in to help himself to some. I crouched behind the dining room table and carefully lined up my shot , I was zeroed in on the spot where his back ends where his tail starts. 3,2,1….POW! I missed by about 18 inches (This thing is wildly inaccurate FYI), but he goes straight into fight or flight wildly looking around at what the noise was. We make eye contact, and I chamber another dart. POW! Missed again. But he saw the dart go flying by and straight up lost it, sprung off the counter and hit the hardwood floor in full sprint. However, the floors are brand new and he couldn’t get any traction, so he was just hilariously running in place like Wile E. Coyote on an oil slick. POW! This one actually connects as he digs in and takes off upstairs. Mission Accomplished.Nowadays, if I ever see him perched about to jump up on the counter, or any other behavior issues for that matter, I reach into the kitchen drawer and pull this badboy out and he immediately falls into line…feline. And I haven’t fired a shot since that fateful day. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would hunt my cat/wife again.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-load-great-for-target-practice">EASY TO LOAD, GREAT FOR TARGET PRACTICE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids wanted to get this as a gift for Daddy for Christmas. All 3 of them have had an absolute blast playing with it since then. My 4 year old has figured out how to load, aim and shoot it on his own. Both kids love to chase the pellets when they fly all over the house.We use this primarily for &lsquo;target practice&rsquo;. We set up old cereal boxes on the window sill and see how far away we can stand and still knock them over. This thing has quite a range. It will easily shoot across the length of our basement, but aiming from that distance is tough.This is easy to load with pellets. It has a chamber that spins and comes out to the side like a revolver.This has been a great present that the whole family has enjoyed!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="boys-will-love">Boys will love</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased as a gift for my 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> year old. I am not a huge fan of play guns but it was inevitable that he would want one. It is a bit hard to cock the gun back for him but he can do it. I ordered an extra set of bullets and could have bought a few more. He lost a ton trying to shoot it over our house. This gun will shoot very far but we have a 3 story home for our backyard. As a parent just be prepared that this toy will end up in &ldquo;time out as much as it is played with. He is on the younger side for toys like this though. Overall great deal and a cheap toy boys will love!!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-slam-fire-option-is-really-cool-and-i-love-that-this-gun-can-shoot">The &ldquo;slam fire&rdquo; option is really cool, and I love that this gun can shoot &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first Nerf gun I&rsquo;ve bought since the Vulcan was brand new, and I&rsquo;m very impressed with the change. The &ldquo;slam fire&rdquo; option is really cool, and I love that this gun can shoot these darts, Vulcan darts, Velcro OR the suction ones. For Slam Fire you just hold down the trigger and pull back the lever repeatedly and it&rsquo;ll launch one dart per pull. For anyone who had the Maverick, this is a new and improved version that&rsquo;s worked out the kinks. The chamber doesn&rsquo;t rotate when you pull the trigger unless the gun is loaded, and misfiring happens much less often, meaning that each shot has full power.As far as the darts themselves, they fly MUCH farther than regular darts, but be warned - they can curve unexpectedly. Shooting a velcro dart out of this gun it&rsquo;ll go a standard distance in a straight line. Shooting one of these elite darts will easily go twice as far, but land anywhere within 8 feet of the target on either side. Still, it&rsquo;s a toy. Having a 30% chance of hitting your target 50 feet away is better than a 0% chance with a regular dart that can&rsquo;t even go that far.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="mostly-great-blaster">Mostly great blaster!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have 2 of these. One works great, the other, not so much&hellip; keeps misfiring. Seems to do so when the darts aren&rsquo;t in absolute pristine condition&hellip; ie, if they don&rsquo;t slide snugly into the chamber, they don&rsquo;t fire out well.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-a-family-with-older-kids">Great for a family with older kids!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got these for Christmas for the whole family and they are a blast! They provide for a fun time with no need for setup, and require minimal clean up.Pros: They shoot surprisingly fast and far for the size of the gun and exceeded my expectations. The bullets can hurt enough to be annoying, but are not painful. They are easy to re-load and it is quite nice that it holds 6 rounds before you need to re-load.Cons: My 3 and 4 year olds have a really hard time cocking it. It is very easy for me, but they cant seem to be able to do it. This was very unfortunate to find out as they are a huge reason I purchased them. I guess I will have to wait until they get older.I would recommend this to families with older kids who want to have a fun family activity at a reasonable price.READ MORE</p>
