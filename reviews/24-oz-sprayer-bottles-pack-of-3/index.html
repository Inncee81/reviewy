<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="p-i-t-a">P.I.T.A.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All three of the bottles I received were terrible. The sprayers kept popping off of the bottle necks. I tried twisting them on tighter and found that if I twist too tightly it simply pops off. I twist to the point where it won&rsquo;t pop off and it loosens while using it and comes apart anyways. The only way I can use them is to pump a few sprays, tighten again, and keep repeating which is ridiculous. Maybe I just received a bad batch but all three bottles were the same. It appears that the threads are not deep enough to keep them assembled. They are useless to me and are now in the garbage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality">Great quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid constructionGreat spray range, from a very fine mist, all the way up to a stinging stream!I bought these because my cat loves to claw my new leather couch, well, shes learning.I keep these throughout the living room, and am now like a texas gun slinger. I am the fastest water bottle draw in the Pacific Northwest. And my cat, she spends alot of time licking the water off of her coat, im convinced that she likes the taste of the water, so she tries to claw the couch knowing that she will get sprayed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-sprayers">Excellent sprayers.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these bottles to replace a very old one I have, that still works but has seen better days. I use them for spraying my garlic mixture on plants so that the deer won&rsquo;t nibble them. I love the deer we get here but don&rsquo;t want them to eat all my plants, so I save some for myself and the bees and butterflies with a spray garlic mixture that works extremely well!These sprayers work great and I love the way they feel in my hand, very comfortable indeed and I have small hands. They are a good size too, bigger than ones I have bought before from stores like Ace Hardware. I have already given one away to my neighbor to use the deer mixture on her window boxes. I will definitely be buying more of them as I use spray bottles for all sorts of things in the house and around the garden.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-leaks-like-a-sieve-out-of-the-spray-adjustment-nut">One leaks like a sieve out of the spray adjustment &ldquo;nut&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Two of the three spray bottles work as advertised. One leaks like a sieve out of the spray adjustment &ldquo;nut&rdquo;. With the adjustment nut removed I found that the threads were deformed, thus the massive leak. For the price its ok&hellip;. but as others have mentioned its a crap shoot. See photo for good and bad threads&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="break-right-away">Break right away</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I would never use 3 of these bottles. Unfortunately they break right away and all 3 ended up in the trash. What a waste. I am on Amazon to buy a spray bottle which I need once again. It just will not be these poorly constructed ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="warning-product-has-changed">Warning: Product Has Changed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>no longer the same product as shown!!! i ordered this 3 pack two years ago and it was a great deal but this time i was sent three bottles that were different, smaller, unmarked, and clearly much lower quality. they are decent spray bottles but not nearly as good as before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-wanted">Just what I wanted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these mainly because I had a full bottle of windex with a nozzle that no longer worked. I bought these so I could have a replacement and to organize my cleaning supplies a little more. I like that the sides of these bottles give you a way to label what they are in a way that looks consistent across your spray-on cleaning products. The compact shape of these bottles makes them easier to organize than with the insconsistency of default sprayers. It has boxes on the side such as &lsquo;glass cleaner&rsquo; &lsquo;all purpose&rsquo; &lsquo;degreaser&rsquo; and a few others. There is also a large blank space you could use to right the actual name of the product and maybe write the uses or some instructions (useful for kids/husbands when you are away). I also like these because I prefer to buy my cleaning supplies in bulk (Costco) and would rather have refillable bottles which is probably more environmentally friendly to at least some extent.I do not have any cons about his product, it is simply what I expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fell-apart-until-i-fixed-them">Fell apart until I fixed them.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first bottle I used seemed to work well at first. Then the sprayer assembly came off the bottle body and I had the liquid I was spraying on me. The second one worked great. The third one was a repeat of the first. That is when I decided to closely examine the product and found that during assembly two gaskets had been installed on the tubes of the sprayer assemblies of the two bottles that had come apart when used. The extra gasket prevented the sprayer assembly from screwing onto the bottle body properly. Therefore, I cut one gasket off each and now all three screw together well, do not come apart unexpectedly, and so far work great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-awesome-their-spray-is-powerful">These are awesome. Their spray is powerful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bought spray bottles in that past that never worked very well. These are awesome. Their spray is powerful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pack-of-3-is-awesome-1-for-cleaning">Pack of 3 is awesome!! 1 for cleaning</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pack of 3 is awesome!! 1 for cleaning, 1 spare, and 1 for spraying the cat when hes into something he isn&rsquo;t supposed to be into! Super value for your buck!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-cool">Not cool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Trigger broke after 3 pulls. Not cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bottle that sprays works just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-money">Worth the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are not your dollar store bottles! I&rsquo;ve never spent the $ to get quality water bottles but glad I did. Use them all over the house and out too! Great quality!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-good-sprayers-and-perform-well">These are good sprayers and perform well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good sprayers and perform well. I use them for pesticide application on my house plants. They seem strong and I hope they last. So far a good buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-leaks">No leaks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great investment. They are made well. NO leaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="usefull-economical-and-effective-in-delivery-of-contents">Usefull, economical, and effective in delivery of contents</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great squirters. I take to top off of the bottle and screw it onto a bottle of 91% Rubbing alcohol. I keep these in every room.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-and-uses">Quality and uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems there is always another spray bottle is needed. These sprayers are far better and heavy duty than most I see in stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-purchased-the-three-pack-and-i-received-three-bottles">I purchased the three pack and I received three bottles &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the three pack and I received three bottles but only two sprayers. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t notice this right away.</p>
