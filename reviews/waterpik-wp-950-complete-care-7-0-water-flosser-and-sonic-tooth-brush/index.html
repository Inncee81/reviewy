<h5 id="important-changes-to-this-model-make-it-better-yet-than-previous-model">Important Changes To This Model Make It Better Yet Than Previous Model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My family has been using the Waterpik WP-900 Complete Care system for quite some time so this review will be two-fold. I will be reviewing this for anyone who wonders how this compares to that model system, and I will also try to approach this from the perspective of someone who has not idea what to expect from this unit. I will try to label sections so you can skip to read what you want to know about, as it will be a lengthy review.WHAT IS THIS SYSTEM LIKE?The system has a rechargeable toothbrush that has changeable heads. You can put the extra heads in the unit that has storage for FIVE heads and waterpik nozzles as well. You can each have a toothbrush head. This comes with FOUR- two small heads and two larger ones. It also comes with a carry case for the toothbrush if you have to travel, and a plastic case for the heads and nozzles to carry as well. Both have slots for air so they can breathe.The unit has a reservoir in it which contains water to power the waterpik. There is a curled plastic tube connected to the waterpik. There is an off switch that goes back and forth to power the unit. It also comes with a variety of tips for the waterpik.The dials on the unit are encircled with metal that is rough for grip so you can turn them with wet fingers. There is an off and on dial and also a dial to change the amount of pressure for the waterpik.INSTRUCTION MANUALWaterpik does a great job of putting an excellent manual in this package. Everything is explained very well and is easy to follow. There are illustrations as well as writing in this manual so it should be easy for most people to understand.HOW DOES THIS UNIT PERFORM?This is a wonderful system. The toothbrush cleans like no other toothbrush we have ever had (including many other similar models of other brands). It leaves the teeth truly clean and the waterpik is fantastic as well. We have had wonderful results when using the waterpik and brush together daily, but even if we skip a day or two (using a regular toothbrush) we still have great results.Everyone in the family likes a different pressure so the dial is wonderful to have. The idea is that you start out with low pressure to build up your tolerance and some people keep it there, others in the family go way up in pressure. The key is to turn your head to the side and let the water run out of the corner of your mouth into the sink and it works with the least mess.OTHER TIPSI have used the pocket tip which you have to use on gentle pressure and it works well- that is for periodontal pockets. My daughter uses that orthodontic brush for her retainer which she has to wear during the day at times, and she used it for her braces and loved it. The plaque seeker tip is good for bridges and crowns, etc, and works well, but the bristles will splay pretty quickly - that is normal for this tip.TOOTHBRUSH REPLACEABLE BATTERY?No, the battery in the toothbrush base is not replaceable, so when it has stopped taking a charge, you have to discard it.HOW DOES THIS UNIT COMPARE TO THE WP-900?DIALThe dial of the 900 is a dial that has a raised edge up the middle for easy turning. This dial is round with a metal band encircling it which has a very rough texture so it will grip. It seems sturdier in this unit. The incremental pressure settings are very similar.WATERPIK BASEThis is where I will have to rave. The old unit had a press button in it. That meant that to use it, you would press in the button and it would stop the flow of water so that you could either put the tip in your mouth or remove it without spraying water everywhere. It was great- until it stopped working. After a while, the spring inside malfunctioned and the button would get stuck inside the base and it would not work. We had to shut off the unit and keep pushing in the button until we could set it free. We ended up having to cover the unit to put in our mouth if it was running, or have it in the mouth and then turn it on, which was difficult to do as it didn&rsquo;t always work out well.This unit has an off and on SWITCH that slides back and forth. So far, no stuck buttons, but time will tell if this will work long term or not.COLORThe 900 unit was blue instead of clear and had blue trim on it. This is dull boring clear and gray- something that is great when it is new, but as water is used in it, it shows up more in clear and on gray and I prefer the blue. Even when you clean it constantly, it still begins to look rather grungy over time when it is clear and the blue helped dispel that appearance.FOOTPRINTThis footprint of the 950 is a touch smaller than the 900 was, but they are pretty close. It seems like there is not quite a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch difference in the length of the bottom than on my other unit, but maybe I am wrong. I have measured a few times and put them next to each other and the 950 seems just a tiny bit smaller.WILL THE TOOTHBRUSH BASE RECHARGE IN THIS UNIT?Yes. They are the same- just different colors.TOOTHBRUSH HEADS DIFFERENT?Yes, these come with blue bands and my other unit came with green bands on it.WILL THIS TAKE THE SAME TIPS AS THE 900?Yes. They are interchangeable.THE BOTTOM LINESo far we really like the WP950. It is a great system. I love that they changed the button to a slide switch so it won&rsquo;t stick anymore. The dials seem to be a bit more hefty than in the 900 unit as well. Time will tell however. The pump is the same and the set up is the same. Just a few changes made me love it even more than the previous one which we loved too despite the problems.I will update with any changes or further observations as they occur. As of now, I give this five stars for excellent performance and changes made which greatly improve over the last model.</p>

<h5 id="eureka">Eureka!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I suffer from periodontal disease and going to the dentist was always a hassle and painful for me. I brush twice a day and floss at least once a day and I was still getting disappointing results at the dentist. I bought this product thinking it couldn&rsquo;t hurt and let me tell you it has made a world of difference in my dental hygiene. I used it after flossing and brushing and couldn&rsquo;t believe the remnants of food that this dislodged and washed away. Now I see that brushing and flossing isn&rsquo;t enough to do the job proficiently. I recently bought another one for my wife because she kept hogging mine&rsquo;s. Great buy for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy about purchasing this item! A gift to myself that I should&rsquo;ve bought ages ago. I have to say, after using this my mouth is so refreshed! Mainly because of the water flosser! I will always have one of these in my life from here on out! Definitely going to recommend this to others! The spray is powerful! It really cleans better than I expected! Dentall hygienist will be happy! Lol.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-dental-care-combo">Awesome dental care combo!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow - totally love this thing! I&rsquo;m a bit OCD about my teeth and already had a Sonicare toothbrush but this combination product was exactly what I was looking for. The toothbrush is fantastic and the waterpik feature is way better than I expected! I does take a bit of trial and error to get it in the correct position but the results are well worth the time. Be sure to use this over the sink as it does spray lots of water/ I just received this yesterday so I can&rsquo;t rate dependability but hope this has a nice long life:)</p>

<h5 id="loud-but-very-good-unit-waterpik-stands-behind-their-products-if-you-have-a-problem">Loud but very good unit. Waterpik stands behind their products if you have a problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned the previous version of this WP-900 for around a year, and got this to compare and use when/if the other product breaks.I tested it, and this unit is virtually identical to it. Other than the color, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find any differences. Bottom line is unless this product is within $5 or $10 dollars of the WP-900 you are better off buying the previous one. Virtually the only differences is included pieces (more brush heads) and the gray color (which does look better than the blue of the WP-900)* At the time of this review, there is no announced price for this product.So lets talk about the product, first toothbrush, then water flosser.Toothbrush:Pros:- Rechargeable battery.- Includes 4 total heads in the package.- Replacement heads are about $5 on amazon, which is less expensive than competing products.Cons:- The second setting should be a little slower. Right now you are pretty much forced to use the first setting. (which is fine) But if you want it a little faster and hit the second setting, it&rsquo;s crazy fast vibrations and loud, uncomfortable on the teeth (not to mention you gotta close your mouth tight or toothpaste will fly everywhere).- little bulky (thick)Water flosser:Pros:- 10 speed settings (I personally like it at 8, but my teeth are pretty close together so this is a good setting to get them clean)- Cleans very well between teeth.Cons:- It&rsquo;s very loud at any setting, louder as you go up, but really its very loud at even the more basic setting. You really can&rsquo;t use it late at night or you&rsquo;ll wake up people, it&rsquo;s that loud.Overall:- While it boast of being a space saver, 2 devices in one. This is still a large footprint item. It just takes a lot of counter space.- 2 year warranty is better than the regular 1 year warranties most manufacturers are giving these days.Warranty/Support:- I had a problem with the WP-900, and called Waterpik for support. Their service was excellent, and sent a replacement part right away. This is very important for me, and I almost gave this item 5 stars, because I know they stand behind their product. Really easy to deal with their support.</p>
