</ul>

<p>The Micca OriGen+ USB audio DAC and preamplifier is a studio master grade digital audio playback device that supports high resolution PCM audio up to 24-bit/192kHz and DSD64 audio. Its powerful preamp and headphone amplifier makes the OriGen+ especially well suited in a compact desktop computer audio system together with powered monitors and headhpones. Use the OriGen+ to bypass a computer&rsquo;s sound card and unlock the full sonic potential of your music library.</p>

<p>Digital Finesse
The digital circuitry of the OriGen+ consists of a VIA VT1736 USB 2.0 High Speed 480Mbps audio controller and a Cirrus Logic CS4392 stereo D/A converter. This capable combination provides asynchronous decoding and conversion of PCM audio up to 24-bit/192kHz as well as native and DoP support for DSD64 (2.8MHz) audio. Advanced audio stream interface support includes both ASIO and WASAPI Push/Event output modes.</p>

<p>Analog Brawn
The analog section of the OriGen+ provides switchable line-level or headphone output, using JRC NJM4556 op amps with two output gain levels of 5.6Vrms and 1.7Vrms. The selectable gain design provides excellent drive capability into any downstream amplifiers with enhanced signal strength, low noise, and low interference. The headphone outputs are similarly powerful, with only 0.5 Ohm output impedance and able to drive 16-600 Ohm headphones.</p>

<p>Solid Construction
Starting with a steel tub chassis, the OriGen+ is capped with an anodized aluminum top plate and finished with a solid machined aluminum volume knob. The TOCOS sealed potentiometer used for volume control offers long operating life and a smooth weighted feel. The all-metal construction makes the OriGen+ exceptionally durable and helps shield against unwanted interference.</p>

<p>Hearing is believing, try the OriGen+ risk free with your own music. If you are not absolutely delighted with the OriGen+&rsquo;s performance, simply return it for a refund.</p>

<h5 id="micca-origen-vs-the-schiit-fulla-2">Micca OriGen+ vs the Schiit Fulla 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent DAC and Amp. I tried this and the Schiit Fulla 2 out and I ultimately decided to keep this.Both are fairly feature rich that they also have a pre-amp out (Fulla 2 also has a DAC line out). Both have a nice volume pot on top and a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; headphone out in front with the origen+ also having a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; out. The Origen has a low and high gain as well. Origen uses a switch to manually go from line out to headphone out while the Fulla 2 recognizes if you remove the headphone out it goes to pre-amp and if you insert it goes to headphone. If you do the line-level out both can be played at the same time which is what I did.Fulla 2 does not need drivers, plug in via USB (which also powers it or you can use another seperate usb to power). Windows recognizes it as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Fulla Schiit&rdquo; hah Plug and play essentially.Origen+ can be plug &amp; play if you use the optical input (Fulla 2 only has usb for digital). However then you need to power via a micro USB with wall wart which is what I do. Or you can buy a 5V plug to power it seperately. IF you decide to connect via micro USB to your PC you do NOT need a separate power, it will power over micro usb as well, however if you&rsquo;re running Windows 10 Anniversary update, you have to do a unsigned driver work around. Instructions on their website.Both feel like quality DAC/Amps, hefty and a lot of metal. Both include a micro USB and that&rsquo;s it for the Fulla 2, the Origen included a 3.5mm to RCA L/R which I used to hook up my desktop logitech speakers.In terms of amping power, both are pretty much even. Powers the relatively hungry 64 Ohm AKG K701 just fine, with maybe the OriGen+ needing less on the volume dial, but all the same both get loud. I haven&rsquo;t tested it with anything more.DAC on both are excellent, no discernible difference, but I can tell a difference from my onboard to either these, especially to the speakers.Pricing Origen+ was $110 no tax prime shippingFulla 2 was $110 after $10 priority 2 day shippingsame price, can&rsquo;t go wrong with either. Consider if you want a high/low gain and optical option. Also consider if you want a DAC line out that is independent of volume pot on the DAC/Amp itself.</p>

<h5 id="the-desktop-dac-amp-to-get-better-than-the-audioengine-d1">THE Desktop DAC/Amp to Get, Better Than the Audioengine D1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally write reviews for products that merely do their job as expected. This DAC/amp falls into that category, but it stands out for being the best, most flexible, and highest value product among its competitors. If you&rsquo;re looking for a DAC/amp for around $100, let me save you the time you would&rsquo;ve otherwise spent doing research and just get this. However, if you do want to research, my thoughts are below.There are a variety of competitive products around its price range from the likes of Audioengine, SMSL, and others, but none hit every mark the way the Micca Origen+ does. This is an all-encompassing solution for virtually all your computer audio needs. The DAC allows you to send the sound away from your dirty, noisy motherboard to a dedicated, isolated unit. Though drivers are required, it supports a wider range of audio bit rates and sampling frequencies (even DSD) than most of its competitors. Due to changes in driver signing enforcement in the Anniversary Update for Windows 10, you will have to use a workaround to install them (instructions on Micca site), but this is merely a one-time inconvenience. You can then output the sound to powered speakers or headphones. Volume is managed by the large, ergonomically intelligent knob on top. It turns smoothly, is natural to the touch, and is far superior to the D1&rsquo;s knob. The unit accommodates all headphones as it sports both 3.5 mm and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch jacks. Personally, I&rsquo;d advise you connect all headphones, even 3.5 mm terminating ones, into the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch via the adapters they usually come with simply because the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch tends to be more sturdy (the jack type, not the Origen+). There are even indicator lights for the sample rate of whatever you&rsquo;re currently playing on top of the unit, something many other competitors don&rsquo;t have. Thankfully, they aren&rsquo;t excessively bright or gaudy. I don&rsquo;t particularly care for such a feature, but one cannot deny it adds to the cool factor and pride of ownership.I actually moved from the more expensive Audioengine D1, probably its most direct competitor, to this. You may ask why I&rsquo;d go from a more expensive unit to the Origen+. As far as I can tell, the sound quality is largely similar between the two. The D1 might have the slightest edge when outputting to powered speakers, but we&rsquo;re really splitting hairs here. I use a pair of Emotiva Airmotiv 6s, which are relatively high-end monitors, and most of the time I either can&rsquo;t tell a difference or I&rsquo;m second-guessing. Given the preamp section on both are equally competent, the real kicker for me was the Origen+&rsquo;s superior headphone amp. Specifically, the Origen+ has only a 0.5 ohm output impedance. I believe I had an older D1 unit that featured a 10 ohm output, but even the newer ones list a 2 ohm output. Based on my understanding, the ideal impedance ratio is 12:1, so the Origen+ is a much better match for 30 - 50 ohm headphones. It also has a high gain mode to boost the output in case you really need the power (please note this also affects the preamp output to speakers). Having recently invested in quality headphones like the PSB M4U 2 and the Philips Fidelio X2, I wanted to feed them with a better-matched amp. Impedance matching aside, despite both being USB-powered, the Origen+ simply has a beefier amp, especially when using the high gain switch. I also prefer the analog volume controls of the Origen+ over the D1&rsquo;s digital implementation. Theoretically, analog volume controls have left/right channel imbalances at very low signal levels, but anyone doing any critical listening wouldn&rsquo;t be listening at whisper-quiet volumes anyway. Plus, it allowed me to achieve a lower volume floor than what the D1&rsquo;s digital volume gave me.TL;DR: Whether you need a desktop DAC/amp to connect powered speakers or headphones, the Micca Origen+ is the most obvious solution for you around and moderately above the $100 mark. The fact that it is $70 cheaper than the Audioengine D1 is simply icing on the cake.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-any-dinky-sound-card-out">Better than any dinky sound card out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hands down improves audio quality. This straight up is better than any internal sound card you can get for your pc. It takes the pure digital signal and converts it to sound. External means no interference from internal pc components. With the flick of the db switch it will give you INSANELY loud sound. Forget about cheapo products, you want LOUD sound, and CRYSTAL quality, this is what you want. Forget about e.q.&rsquo;s, software, and junky Creative labs products. This right here is industrial grade sound equipment, you can make it so loud YOU DON&rsquo;T NEED, and e.q. to compensate. It raises the entire sound stage of whatever you&rsquo;re listening to to make an e.q. an after thought. Though there are software program e.q.s you can use if you really did want to sound shape. There is no contest though, if you want the best possible sound, and you want it LOUD, this is what you want. Thing can take a dinky set of earbuds and melt your head, total improvment, I will never buy Creative Labs products again, the OriGen is better than anything Creative has ever made, I&rsquo;m saying this after using their gimicky products that have constantly failing software e.q. setups for quite a time. Don&rsquo;t even think about it, if you&rsquo;re looking for an upgrade to your pc audio this is it. Pure Digital to Analog conversion; no bs, with a huge sound amplification to boot. Clear and Head Meltingly loud.</p>
