<blockquote>
<p>I love my Crosstour Action Cam. It delivers high quality pictures and videos for an <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of th price . I would put the quality up against any go pro. It came with all kinds of accessories in the box . It also came with 2 batteries which was a plus.I love this camera . Just look at the quality of the pics I took fishing. I am an outdoors enthusiast .. I can&rsquo;t wait to mount it to my bow and go deer hunting.. I recommend this camera to everyone</p>

<h5 id="fun-product">Fun product !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Crosstour Action Camera 1080P Full HD Wi-Fi 12MP Waterproof Cam 2&rdquo; LCD 30m Underwater 170°Wide-angle Sports Camera with 2 Rechargeable 1050mAh Batteries and Mounting Accessory KitsI have been looking for an action camera for outdoor activities. I am not very good with electronics, but it is easy for me to figure it out this camera. This action camera is very small but with a larger screen to view videos and pictures. There are a lot of accessories to mount the camera to the helmet, bicycles, and wrist. It is a good idea for my next hiking for some beautiful Fall leaves pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-picture-quality">Great picture quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great little camera. Our son is a skate boarder so the pictures on the box got him all excited about positioning the camera on his helmet and videoing his skills! Light weight, compact, seems to be good quality and picture is clear! Can&rsquo;t wait to take it white water rafting next weekend! Great product and great value!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-finally-tried-it-and-i-m-glad-i-did">I finally tried it and I&rsquo;m glad I did</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had an action cam but have talked about it for quite awhile. I finally tried it and I&rsquo;m glad I did! This is easy to use, comes with mounting accessories you might need and the picture quality is good too. The zippered case keeps it all organized so you have it all in your hands in a snap. This is a great quality bundle, especially for the price. I&rsquo;m so glad I didn&rsquo;t order a Go Pro. This completely meets my needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-useful-action-camera">Very useful action camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best action camera for the price! It comes with bunch of accessories that can hook the camera to multiple equipments at different angles. I love the water proof case that seal the camera with great protection when we took it to the beach. It also very light and won&rsquo;t bother me at all when I use it. My little boy also love to carry it and got a lot of funny videos. I did not try the phone application yet. But the camera itself is a great value! I recommend it!</p>

<h5 id="the-action-camera-is-great-it-picks-up-fantastic-footage-and-i-was">The action camera is great! It picks up fantastic footage and I was &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The action camera is great! It picks up fantastic footage and I was amazed by how many attachments it came with. The camera can be put on helmets, bikes, or snowboards. The case is very protective. I ordered Crosstour Action Camera Battery Dual Rechargeable 1050mAh Batteries with USB Charger for Action Cameras and they work great in the camera! With both batteries you can pretty much be assured that you won&rsquo;t run out of battery.</p>

<h5 id="good-low-price-alternate-to-a-more-expensive-action-camera">Good low price alternate to a more expensive action camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera performed actually better than I expected. Quality if images is high and it is simple to operate. It came with many mounting options and an extra battery. I am quite satisfied as I bought this to use in an environment in which the camera had a chance to be destroyed. It was not and I can continue to use it. I have only had it for a week but it survived some hard use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow-great-picture-and-video-quality">WOW, great picture and video quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW!!! Great picture quality. If I knew this was the case I would have saved myself a lot of money.Absolutely no reason to buy Go pro and pay hundreds of dollars. This camera is AWESOME and at a great price.It comes with a lot of accessories to enable you to mount it on just about anything .I am seriously thinking of buying another one .Perfect Birthday gift</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-difference-between-this-one-and-the-400-go-pro">No difference between this one and the $400 go pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need to buy the $ 300 or $400 cam to do the same things you looking for, this one has it all very steady in my gmc Truck and very beautiful videos.</p>
