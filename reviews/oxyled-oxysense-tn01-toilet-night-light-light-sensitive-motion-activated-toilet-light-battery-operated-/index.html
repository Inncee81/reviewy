<h5 id="worked-well-for-2-months-then-pooped-out-pun-intended">Worked well for 2 months, then pooped out&hellip;(pun intended).</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I initially bought this because it was the cheapest option as it was on sale. For about 2 months, these were great. I had a wide array of colors to choose from, the motion sensor worked well, and it just did what it was intended for. I was also willing to let the fact that it did not stay on long enough to finish taking care of business 50% of the time since everything else about it was so great. After two months,for whatever reason, I noticed that the original color option of white light that I had chosen for both was unavailable to me. No idea why, but that and several other colors disappeared from the choices when I tried to run through them and change it. This was another thing that I decided to overlook as long as some of the colors still worked and that my toilet bowl was illuminated. Not too long after, I noticed that the light was fading in both units so I figured that I needed to change the batteries. I did so with brand new batteries and initially this fixed my issue. Maybe two days later they were dead again and now I can&rsquo;t get them to turn on no matter what batteries I put in or what I do. Started off promising with some quirks, but quickly became useless for unknown reasons. I&rsquo;m disappointed that this occurred after the one month mark because now I will be unable to return them and get a replacement. As of now this is a zero star product for me, but I kept two stars on for how pleased I was initially.</p>

<h5 id="great-solution-for-nighttime-trips">Great solution for nighttime trips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone laughs when I tell them about my new multi-color toilet night light, but it&rsquo;s a great improvement for the person who has to visit the bathroom during the night. It solves the problem of a nightlight always shining too brightly out the bathroom door and it puts the light right where you need it. It does take a little getting used to, sitting down on a glowing toilet bowl but that&rsquo;s where you learn to lower the brightness of the light! The controls are simple to use. It helps this has both a motion and light sensor - in the bathroom with a window the light goes on only at night, even on really cloudy days. The other bathroom does not have a window and the light will go on anytime there is motion in the hallway outside the bathroom &ndash; then I am glad that the motion-activated light is on a timer and shortly switches off automatically. I have cleaned the bathrooms a couple times since I got them and they are not an issue since only the thinnest and smallest part of the light is inside the toilet bowl, the rest sits outside the bowl. I have 2 very different style toilets: one with a standard thickness bowl rim and another with an oval shape and a much thicker rim - this light easily adapted to both rims.</p>

<h5 id="just-plain-trash">Just plain trash</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 4 of these over the course of 6 months (2x 2-packs from two different vendors). All four have failed. The general process is after the second battery change, the LED starts to dim dramatically and eventually gives up after 2 weeks of diminished performance. They all reside in a landfill at this point.The construction is cheap. There&rsquo;s no waterproofing at all, which considering where they are intended to reside you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d at least have a rubber ring around the battery chamber. I had at least one, though it might have been two, that corroded around the base of the LED. Just plain trash.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-impressed">Not impressed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure if it&rsquo;s by design but the light only shuts off when the bathroom light turns on. I was hoping it would turn off after a few minutes of no motion but that isn&rsquo;t the case. It stays on all night as a result and wastes batteries.UPDATE: the light I got was defective and wouldn&rsquo;t turn off after 35 seconds of no motion. It eventually ran the batteries out, and then during the second set of batteries the light completely died. The vendor at least issued a refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="makes-a-nice-little-night-light">Makes a nice little night light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these, one was given as a gift, and the other stayed at my house. The one given as a gift works perfectly, but the one that I kept won&rsquo;t stay on the toilet. Always on and never shuts off. Makes a nice little night light, but not what I was hoping for. I contacted the company, and they have provided a full refund for the one that malfunctioned. I appreciate their attempt to make things right. Their customer service is professional and attentive.</p>

<h5 id="technology-these-days-haha">Technology these days&hellip; haha</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as I took it out of the packaging and opened the battery door the release part broke off. I ended up taping the edge because I am the type of person that hates returning things haha. So I finally got it working with a few long presses of the button, and not reading the directions. I mean there is a sensor and one button, how hard can it be? I got it set up the way I wanted it. Had to bend the adjustable arm to pretty much wrap up and under the toilet bowl lid, so much so I thought it might get wet when you flush but it&rsquo;s been great since. I have two dogs though and they trigger this often so I&rsquo;m sure the batteries will die fairly quickly. Otherwise I do like it, is nice to not have to turn on my daylight led bathroom light when I have to go to the bathroom at night or in the morning. It also shuts off whenever I turn on the lights which is nice too saving battery. I only give it a 3 star because it broke out of the package. Also, not sure if it is stated in the directions since I tossed them, but I had to place mine on the front of the bowl because my toilet is by my bathroom door so if the door is open anyone could trigger motion sensor. I placed it there instead to save battery life.</p>

<h5 id="they-were-amazing-unfortunately">they were amazing. Unfortunately</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When they worked, they were amazing. Unfortunately, both were dead within a months time. Living in a house with all dudes, there&rsquo;s gonna be some splash back. Sadly, once the pee got into the unit, I think it shorted them.They&rsquo;d be incredible if they were a little more sturdily built, and able to withstand wee wee.UPDATE: OxyLED reached out to me and replaced my defective units free of cost. The new ones seem to be holding up very nicely.I appreciate them being proactive and reaching out to me directly, and supplying me with replacements. Well done!</p>
