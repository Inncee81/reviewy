<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="favorite-pair-of-gloves-so-far">Favorite pair of gloves so far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far my favorite pair of gloves. I like long finger gloves even when riding Road and especially when riding mountain and track These gloves are touch screen sensitive so make good for using a phone and Gps. They do fit small so you should consider going up a size. That is to say I normally wear a medium but wear a large in these. I do find that the Giro DND gloves one fault is there stiching, eventually it will separate somewhere</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-good-i-bought-a-second-pair">So good I bought a second pair</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a pair of these gloves because I needed something to protect my hands while gravel biking. I had owned other gloves for biking but they always seemed a little loose. These had a nice tight fit but the glove are a little elastic so they have some give.The material is very sturdy and has some grippy portions in case you need to grab something. The palm of the glove appears to be leather. I just got the gloves soaking wet recently, so we will see how they hold up to getting wet then drying off. I have owned these gloves for about 6 months at this point and overall they have held up well. I used them 2-3 time a week. Stitching remains intact and the gloves haven&rsquo;t lost their shape.The best endorsement i can give is that after owning these gloves for only a month, I bought a second pair. They are that good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-the-little-tabs-at-the-bottom-of-the-palm">I love the little tabs at the bottom of the palm &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used these gloves for my daily commute for a month now plus weekend rides. In total they have been through about 120 km. So far, I am loving them. They are breathable and light. I love the little tabs at the bottom of the palm for ease of pulling the gloves on.The fit is perfect. I can also use my iphone while wearing the gloves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-thin">Too thin</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I see that this product has good reviews so I may be the outlier but I was very disappointed in these gloves. They are quite thin with almost no padding. I had planned to use them mtb-ing but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that a single mild crash would results in these things being shredded. I&rsquo;m returning them and will look for something a bit hardier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-gloves-perfect-fit-very-comfortable-and-they-look-cool">Awesome gloves!! Perfect fit, very comfortable and they look cool!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the military green in size small and they fit just perfect. I had bought a similar but different brand pair of gloves and were awful, these are awesome and really didn&rsquo;t even noticed them throughout my last ride which means they are just right. They look great and are very comfortable. So for anyone out there looking for a new pair of mtb gloves stop looking and try these I think you will like them as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-what-was-expected">Not what was expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The pair I got were a little darker in color and the material is thinner than it looks in the picture. There are ever-so-slight extra pads but nothing like the ones you get at AutoZone or Home Depot made by Mechanix on the palms. Will update after rigorous workout at my job.UPDATE: The gloves work great, can&rsquo;t attest to durability though. The only real grip is from the yellow strips on the fingertips.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-great-full-coverage-gloves">These are great full coverage gloves</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great full coverage gloves, but are not heavily padded. great fingertip dexterity though. I use them for keeping the skin on when mountain biking, and for those cold morning commutes. Not too bad in the rain, even. For longer rides I wear a glove with more padding, but these are definitely better in the cold and for protecting your hands in a fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-inexpensive-full-fingered-cycling-glove-runs-small">Good Inexpensive Full-Fingered Cycling Glove - Runs Small</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I originally got these gloves for crits, and thankfully haven&rsquo;t crashed yet so I can&rsquo;t speak to durability on pavement. Edit: I have, however, had about a half dozen CX, XC, &amp; DH crashes and they performed well - good protection and no blown seams.They flow a pretty good amount of air for a full fingered glove, and they&rsquo;re comfortable into the low/mid 80s. The synthetic suede provides a nice grip on the bars, and I like the little sticky pads on the fingertips for good touch your brakes &amp; shifters. That they&rsquo;re velcro strap-free is also a big plus. Edit: See update below - maybe not such a plus since the seam on the pull tab ripped.The gloves did run way small for me. I usually wear a size L glove, but gave my original pair of large DNDs to my girlfriend, who usually wears a M. I also considered returning my XL&rsquo;s for a XXL, but ended up keeping them since crits are pretty short. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll also stretch a bit once they&rsquo;re broken in.Update: After about a season of use, these gloves started to rip along the seam of the pull tab on the palm. Still usable, but disappointing. Still give them four stars due to the low price and good protection.</p>

<h5 id="these-gloves-are-great-would-buy-again">These gloves are great, would buy again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These gloves are great, would buy again. They seemed a little small when I first got them but after a few rides they fit well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-gloves-great-price">Good gloves, great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for. Good fit. No padding so good grip and feel while hammering through the trails. Would recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very good product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-gloves-are-nice-for-the-price">The gloves are nice for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Order a size larger than normal. I wear a medium in all gloves but these&hellip;had to return and get a large. The gloves are nice for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-gloves-for-the-money-no-padding-and-just">Decent gloves for the money, no padding and just &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent gloves for the money, no padding and just a bit tight to be considered Large, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I have big hands but they are snug</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-good-fit">Excellent quality, good fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality, good fit, comfortable but a little heavier of a glove. Good for 55-70 degree weather. Anything hotter and you&rsquo;ll want a more breathable glove.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fitting-gloves">Great Fitting Gloves</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing glove for my gravel or mtb rides. Feels great on the palm, without too much padding. Straightforward glove for the dirt and you need full finger protection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-em">Love em</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second pair, the first are still going strong I just wanted some different colors. They&rsquo;re great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-ugly-and-really-tough-to-get-off-on-grips-good-and-endures-sweat-well-really-small-for-an-xl">Pretty ugly and really tough to get off/on. Grips good and endures sweat well. Really small for an XL.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmm. There are definitely better gloves available. Pretty ugly and really tough to get off/on. Grips good and endures sweat well. Really small for an XL.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fit-perfect-feel-nice-after-a-short-break-in">fit perfect. Feel nice after a short break-in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered 1 size up than I normally wear, fit perfect. Feel nice after a short break-in.</p>
