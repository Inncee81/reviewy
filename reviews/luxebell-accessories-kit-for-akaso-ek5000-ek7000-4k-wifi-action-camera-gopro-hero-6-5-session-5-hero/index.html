<h5 id="great-starter-kit-for-my-gp-hero-4-session">Great starter kit for my GP Hero 4 Session.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set proved very useful on our last trip, especially the flotie and monopod during snorkeling, and the head strap when kayaking. I haven&rsquo;t used the bike handle clamp and suction cup. The screws got rusty easily, but I think it&rsquo;s because I forgot to rinse them after using in seawater. So DO rinse them after saltwater use. Read the list of actual contents in the details section of the page. Mine did not come with the white plastic case attached to the headstrap in the picture. They explained that that was not included. That&rsquo;s when I checked the details page. But overall a good set for beginners.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-storage-case-has-some-minor-but-important-issues-but-still-works">Good storage case&hellip;has some minor but important issues, but still works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a case to put my cameras in and all the extra mounts and gear. This case does the trick for a reasonable price. It seems well made and accomplishes what I wanted, so I gave it the 4 stars/I like it rating. However, there are two things that would make this even better product and give it a full 5 stars.Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, the handle was placed on the hinge side of the case. If you use the handle, all the items you placed in the net area will fall out of it. Simply moving the handle to the other side of the case would insure the contents of the net area stay in the net. I simply cut the handle off so I wouldn&rsquo;t make that mistake. The case is small enough to be carried without using the handle at all.This leads to my suggestion that you don&rsquo;t bother with the extra manufacturing steps for a handle at all and instead put a positive closure like a zipper or Velcro closures on the net area which makes that more secure and usable. I&rsquo;m going to try to do that for myself down the line.Until then, I will carry it zippered side up and store it in the same fashion.Overall, it&rsquo;s a nicely made unit for holding all your equipment in one place&hellip;I have 2 cameras and associated gear with plenty of room in it. It&rsquo;s not a case that will take a tremendous amount of abuse if you&rsquo;re going off trekking somewhere, but it&rsquo;s compact enough to fit in a bag or backpack to keep all your video gear together so you can find what you need when you want it. I may have rated it a little higher than it deserves, but it seems to be well made and does what I wanted it to at a reasonable price.</p>

<h5 id="so-many-accessories-for-the-money">So many accessories for the money!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really only wanted a few specific accessories for my action camera, but the cost of getting each one individually was costly. Then I found this accessory kit, which included everything I wanted plus more. So far I have used the wrist mount, floating mount, and helmet mount which were all great. They fit perfectly. I wish the pouch that shipped with it was bigger to store all of the accessories, but at this price it&rsquo;s not worth losing a star.</p>

<h5 id="this-camera-is-amazing-i-was-a-little-frustrated-to-hear-about">This camera is amazing! I was a little frustrated to hear about &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The accessories in the kit make filming in any situation easy and in some instances hands free. The case is very durable and so are the high quality accessories inside. This one bundle saved me who knows how many headaches! All of the accessories are very useful and work very well with my GoPro HERO4. This kit makes it easy to film and journal my garden, family events, sporting events, and driving (as a dashcam! Do not operate a camera while driving. Distracted driving has proven fatal and costly!). I even use the handlebar mount with a proper directional mount on my fishing pole for a great angle! I Highly Recommend this Accessory Kit</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I take it with me Hiking, Fishing, Metal Detecting, Abandoned House Hunting, you name it! The kit has a part for it all. The head piece is great for a bike ride and the camera holder for underwater usage is GREAT. If the thing slips it FLOATS&hellip; No more %$#*!@#!!! after you drop it. The pack to carry has plenty of room and I got a simple .50$ clip for it to put it on a belt loop. Thumbs up!</p>

<h5 id="for-my-new-gopro-session-and-the-kit-is-great-as-it-has-practically-all-the-action-gear-your">&hellip; for my new GoPro Session and the kit is great as it has practically all the action gear your &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this kit for my new GoPro Session and the kit is great as it has practically all the action gear your would need. I read many reviews before the purchase and saw that some people had issues with the selfie stick but I thought that maybe they were too rough on it and that is why theirs broke. Well after the second time I extended the pole it broke and two sections of the rod lost their ability to stay up. Not a big deal if your doing straight vertical shots but if you tilt the stick a tad the weight of the camera (and the session is tiny) causes the stick to rotate very freely causing you to loose your shot.I am returning the kit tomorrow, even though I wish they would just send me a new stick but I have to return the entire kit&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-beginner-kit">Great beginner kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m new the whole GoPro movement but as a freelance photography I wanted to jump on this bandwagon and see what sort of cool and interesting pictures the GoPro could add to my portfolio. As others have stated, the list of addons to the GoPro is very long and can be very pricy. Not knowing exactly how I wanted to use my new GoPro 4 HERO, I saw this kit and thought it would allow me a chance to my hands on some great addons that will be be helpful and because of the price, wouldn&rsquo;t bust my wallet. Everything in the kit works great with the OEM products provided by GoPro and the case fits everything nice and neat including the selfie stick but is a little tight with the chest harness. I&rsquo;m sure you can probably find a way to pack everything in there if needed but I find it to fit my needs perfectly. I recommend this kit for anyone like me just joining the GoPro movement and is undecided on what addons to get.</p>

<h5 id="the-mount-stayed-in-place-and-we-had-no-problem-filming-our-trip">The mount stayed in place and we had no problem filming our trip!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Luxebell 5 in 1 Accessories Kit to use with my GoPro Hero Session. It is a set of five premium quality accessories for GoPro Hero Cameras. First of all, the case is great to store the GoPro in, and it is what I use to carry around my accessories. I purchased the kit primarily for the head mount. I used the head mount for a recent skiing trip and it worked very well. The mount was able to easily fit over the skiing helmets my kids wore during the trip. The mount stayed in place and we had no problem filming our trip! I also used the handlebar mount during a recent bike trip and it worked great!</p>
