<h5 id="best-bang-for-your-buck">BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK !!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the BLU R1 HD - 16 GB – Black yesterday in the mail. I was too excited to receive it and for $ 60, I did not expect much out of it. As I opened the package, I found a nice looking box in the package. It was nicely sealed and well packaged. I opened the tab and could not wait to get my hands on this amazing product. As I opened the package, the phone was nicely wrapped in a bag with a screen protector on top to protect the screen from scratching. After I took the protective cover from the phone, I found an amazing looking screen the fitted in my hand nicely. The curved screen is often found in high-end phone but I was surprised to find in a phone under $60. Once I got my hands on the phone, I was looking for the battery to put it in and get it started. However, I could not find the battery. It turns out that the battery is built in and it is non-replaceable battery. But that’s ok, for $ 60, still not a bad bargain. I turned the phone on and it took about 10 minutes for set-up and update the phone. After that, I put my sim in and I made couple of phone calls. It has duel sim card slot and one micro SD card slot ( The maximum accepted is 64GB). The sound quality was very good. I tried the speaker phone and it was loud as well. After that I downloaded couple of games to try. I was blown away with the speed of processer. It held up very well. What was more impressive is that it stands by its name HD. That’s how the picture quality was. After that, I jumped on Amazon videos and started watching movies. Again, the clarity of the picture was outstanding. Another benefit of this phone is that because it is BLU-Amazon partnered phone, you can download Amazon Prime Videos on the phone when you have Wi-Fi so you can watch it offline when you have no internet connection. To me, it’s a plus benefit. Now comes the part of actually putting the phone to the LTE test. It did stand up to the LTE test. It downloads and uploads in a zoom. The down side to the phone is that the phone camera quality lacks a little. However, for $ 60 it is to be expected. Another reason this phone receives four stars from me is that the manual is very poorly written. In the packaging there is no headphones like other manufacturers do. But again, for $ 60 it’s a great phone. Not advanced as other but very well designed and easy to use phone.THE PROS OF THE PHONEPRICE ( WHEN COMPARED TO OTHERS)1.3 GHz Quad Core ProcesserQUALITY5.0 “ CURVED SCREEN &amp; RESOLUTION4G LTE UNDER $ 60 (FOR PRIME MEMBERS)ANDROID 6.0 (LATEST VERSION UPON RELEASE OF THIS PHONE)2 GB RAMEXPANDABLE MEMORY (UP TO 64 GB)CONS OF THIS PHONEPOOR PACKAGING ( not bad but could have been better comming from Amazon)POOR MANUALNO HEADPHONESREAR CAMERA (ONLY 8 MP)FRONT CAMERA (5MP)In short… this is the best phone you can buy under $ 60 (for Prime Members)I AM A NEW REVIEWER THAT HAS ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE PHONE AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT FOR FREE. THEREFORE YOU CAN TRUST MY REVIEW AS I HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN OUT OF IT. [&hellip;]. THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO READ MY REVIEW.</p>

<h5 id="the-only-thing-cheap-about-this-budget-smartphone-is-the-price">The only thing &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; about this budget smartphone is the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The reasonably low price is the only thing that is cheap about this smartphone! I purchased this phone with the intent of using it for when I go on vacation (especially abroad) and don’t want to risk anything happening to my expensive iPhone. The fact that it is unlocked makes it easy to just pop in my sim card and go as I see fit.FIRST IMPRESSION:My first impressions of the phone are that although light, it does not feel “cheap” like you would expect a phone in this price range to be. It is about the same size as an iPhone 6, or Samsung Galaxy S5 in case anybody was wondering.Typing on the phone is easy and feels good, due to the responsive feedback. The auto-correct is accurate and makes sending texts messages a breeze.SPEED:The phone features a 1.3 GHz Quad core processor, and 1 GB of ram. Although there ARE phones with better specs out there, I have found that this phone was able to keep up with just about everything I wanted to do, whether it is browse Reddit, order on Amazon, etc. The phone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow which is very easy to navigate and user friendly.CAMERA:The camera quality on the smart phone is OK. Not horrible by any means, but not the best either. The camera does not perform very well in low light, and will take grainy pictures if a good amount of light is not present. Comparing to my iPhone 6s Plus, I have found that although the R1HD does not capture as wide of an area as the iPhone, pictures come out a bit warmer, which was a pleasant surprise. The camera is 8 mega pixels, and the front facing camera is 5 mega pixels. Not bad for $50. I was not impressed with the video option. Videos come out a bit shaky and grainy. Please see my picture and videos for reference.SOUND &amp; CALL QUALITY:The sound quality of the R1HD is good. Calls come in clear and do not sound muffled. I really like that the manufacturers of this phone decided to put the speaker on the back. This means that when lying down and watching videos, the speaker is not covered like on the iPhone. While I do like the placement of the speaker, it is a bit small. I would have liked a dual speaker design like the iPhone. If you plan on showing a group of friends a video, it may be a bit difficult to hear. In short, the speakers are not the strongest. I would definitely recommend using head phones if you plan on listening to videos of movies. The speaker is OK at best.OTHER:The lock screen offers do not get in the way as much as one might think. In fact, I have found that I’ve already been introduced to some products I wouldn’t have normally known about. I have included a picture to show what the ads look like. IF the ads bother you, you can spend a bit more money and purchase the version without ads.OVERALL:Overall, for a smart phone in this price range, you can’t go wrong. Although the video quality and speaker could be a bit better, you can’t expect much more from a smartphone in this price range.Please let me know if I can answer any questions about this Smart Phone!</p>
