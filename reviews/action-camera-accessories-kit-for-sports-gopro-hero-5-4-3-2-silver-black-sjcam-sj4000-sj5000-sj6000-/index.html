<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit is great for the price! Plenty of different types of mounts. There are enough different type of accessories that you can made something to mount just to about anything. There are several different types of accessory kits out there. I looked through several of them before purchasing. I decided that I would get the most use out of these mounts. I have a Gopro Session that I use with these mounts. The quality of the plastic is decent, but definitely not the best, but for the price its hard to complain.I have used just about every part for one thing or another and have only had one piece break. The plastic part on the wrist mount broke, maybe due to over tightening thought. The suction cup mount holds very tight to windows and car hoods. The elastic parts on the head and chest mount seem to be a very good quality. The mounts remained very tight and sturdy throughout the use. I use the tripod mount probably the most. and seems to be working fine. I was surprised to see what it was able to grab hold of and mount to. The basis handle bar mount holds firm with no issues. The handlebar mount that swivels hold pretty good, but the locking screws seems to be cheaper. It seems like you could over tighten and strip the threads on the plastic if not carful. The floating handle is just a basic handle. Seems to be very sturdy and will keep you from losing your camera while in the water.As far as the case goes. When I received the kit all the mounts were in individually wrapped in plastic bags. They all fit in the hard case. Once I started unwrapping all the pieces I was started to wonder if I would ever get them all back in the case but don&rsquo;t sweat, they will all fit. The case isn&rsquo;t a true &ldquo;hard case&rdquo; it has a little flexibility to it, but still sturdy. The cutouts in the foam seem to be pretty generic shapes. Other than the locking screws nothing really sat in firmly. This isn&rsquo;t a big deal because all of this stuff is somewhat rugged. This is additional room in the hard case for your camera to fit in as well.</p>

<p>I love using my GoPro for everything I do, from adventures to film making to weddings, there is always a use for them. I am no beginner when it comes to my supplies so when Somate came to me to test out their new products I jumped at the chance. Coming from a background of high quality and OEM, I had some high standards, and they made sure to please!Package came very professional, the carrying case fit all the products and it even came with a cool little bag to carry them around!95% of all the supplies were top notch quality and survived my week long adventure trial. There were a few that were not too secure, the selfie stick and the bendable tripod type thing, but nonetheless, very greatly pleased.This package comes with 46 individual items..1 x Somate Helmet Extension Arm1 x Somate Floating Block with 3M Adhesive Pad1 x Somate Bike Handlebar Holder Mount + Long Screw1 x Somate Floating Mount1 x Somate Car Suction Cup Mount1 x Somate Helmet Strap1 x Somate Floation Handle Grip1 x Somate Plastic Wrench1 x Somate Surface Quick Release Buckle + Connection + Screw1 x Somate Carrying EVA Case1 x Somate Wrist Strap1 x Somate Remote Control Wrist Strap1 x Somate Chest Belt Strap Mount1 x Somate Selfie Stick Monopod1 x Somate Tripod Mount Adapter1 x Somate Motor Stand + Tripod Mount Adapter1 x Somate 360 Degree Rotary Clip Mount1 x Somate Head Belt Strap Mount1 x Somate Flexible Octopus Stand Tripod2 x Somate Surface Quick Release Buckle2 x Somate Extendable Mount ( Long + Short)4 x Somate Base ( 2 Curved + 2 Flat)5 x Somate Flat Adhesive Pad6 x Somate Curved Adhesive Pad6 x Somate Screw ( 5 Long + 1 Short )and a free bag for everything! Yeah, that&rsquo;s a lot for a low low price!MANY of the mounts can actually be used indefinitely and you will NOT need to replace at all.Many of the straps and mounts are very sturdy and fit alongside with your first party accessories as well. You can mix and match First and third party nuts and bolts and connectors to achieve the PERFECT shot.These accessories work on ALL GoPro cameras, from the 1 all the way to the newest Hero 4, it is also compatible with the various GoPro clones that have came up in the market such as clones like Geek Pro, SJ4000, SJ5000 to name a few.This kit is PERFECT for any one who is new to GoPro and action cameras and are looking to expand their collection. This is also great for those who want to try out different mounts without sacrificing an arm and leg in first party costs for a SINGLE accessoryThis kit is perfect for various situations, you can attach it to yourself, you cana ttach it to a car, a window, a boat, a branch, the ground, ANYWHERE with this kit. This is perfect when you want to get a steady shot of something without leaving your camera on the ground or letting it fall or tip over.An added bonus that I really liked is the bag to carry many of the small accessories as well as a carrying and protective case for the camera and some accesories!I would definitely recommend this product to any one who is new to GoPros.I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.I am not affiliated with the seller or company and make no promises of a good rating while reviewing the product.
