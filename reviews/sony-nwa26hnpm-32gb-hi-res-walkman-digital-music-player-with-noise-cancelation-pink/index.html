<h5 id="without-question-sony-s-best-mp3-player-to-date">Without Question, Sony&rsquo;s Best Mp3 Player To Date</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Without doubt, this is Sony&rsquo;s best mp3 player to date, excluding, of course, the hideous expensive and physically heavy Android-based &ldquo;ZX&rdquo; models. I&rsquo;ve owned so many Sony mp3 players over the years that it is difficult to keep track of all of them. Some of the older models came with a startlingly effective noise reduction system, but you were stuck using Sony&rsquo;s proprietary &ldquo;Sonic Stage&rdquo; software which made any interaction with loading or unloading music more tedious than one could imagine. But many of these players were truly excellent, and many were ground-breaking, being far ahead of any other manufacturer when it came to portable digital music technology (first OLED screen, first integrated active noise reduction system, ATRAC encoding, etc.).Late this past year, I purchased the Sony NWZ-A17 Hi-Res player to get the advantages of the Hi-Res technology, and also because it not only came with 64Gb of on-board storage, but also because it had a micro sdxc slot, so, with a 200mb card, you could get your storage up to about a quarter of a terabyte. The sound was great, the problems with Sonic Stage were removed, the unit weighed only 50g, and it sounded fantastic. My only gripe? No noise reduction like some of the older Sony models I had.Well, with the introduction of the NWA26HNLM, we have that noise reduction, and few other things, to boot. I have to say, and this is coming from a person who has experience with almost every mp3 player Sony has ever made, that this player&rsquo;s sound is so good that is unbelievable. The noise reduction, already perfected in earlier Sony iterations, has been extended further, with customizable settings for the noise reduction, including strength, and even TYPE of noise you want eliminated, plus an auto-sense function to sample that noise and reverse noise in different settings.This unit sounds so good, looks so good, and is so well built (the case is made of a solid piece of aluminum) that it is, in my own mind, without question, the best mp3 player Sony has ever put out. The included earphones, which work in tandem with the active noise reduction circuitry, are astoundingly good sounding, and, if you care about such things, just look great. This is a physically beautiful device, even better looking in real life than the photos here (I&rsquo;ll see if I can post some of my own photos in the near future to demonstrate what I mean).Yes, it&rsquo;s not cheap. But for a little over 300 dollars, you get a device that can hold 32Gb + 200Gb of files, uses all the Hi-Res circuitry that Sony has been releasing in the past two years (&ldquo;Hi-Res&rdquo; is not hype; do yourself a favor and look into what Sony puts into their Hi-Res models, and how they differ from tradition models, and the overall topic of high resolution sound recordings that far surpass that of CD-ROMs), puts out sound that I would rate as the best I&rsquo;ve heard, looks great, and still only weight about 60g (including the headphones).I will try to expand this review over time, but for now, let me list some plusses and minuses:++ Superb sound quality++ Utilizes Hi-Res circuitry to reproduce sound all the way to 24 bit/192 kHz, far beyond that of a CD-ROM++ Outstanding, customizable noise reduction that is STARTLINGLY effective++ It may not be publicized, but there is a &ldquo;Quiet Mode,&rdquo; which engages the noise reduction without playing any music. Cool!++ Headphones that are capable of working with the Hi-Res technology and the noise reduction to achieve great sound, and stay in place, too!++ Hi quality mechanical build utilizing a unibody aluminum build++ Gorgeous physical appearance, and available in about six colors++ Physically lightweight++ Works well with both Windows and Mac machinesMinuses&ndash; Pricey&ndash; Only 32Gb on-board memory; my A17 has 64Gb (you can purchase the 64Gb w/ noise reduction only in silver or black in the U.S. at this time)&ndash; Sony proprietary USB cable (not as big of an issue as it used to be, but you have to keep track of it)&ndash; Only USB 2.0 (!) transfer speed (it is true that you are likely to load your micro sdxc card with your computer, making this a moot point, but you still have to connect via USB to load the on-board memory, and with these storage amounts (and the price) why doesn&rsquo;t this (and all expensive Sony MP3 players, including their top-of-the-line &ldquo;ZX&rdquo; series Android-based players) have USB 3.0 connections???&ndash; For some inscrutable reason (copyright?), will not play WMA lossless files, nor will any of the most expensive Sony players, including those in the +$1,000 range (but it plays every other lossless format, plus, of course, all the Hi-Res files, which is the aim of this device to begin with)This is the player I&rsquo;ve been waiting for Sony to build for years. It&rsquo;s finally here, and with features and capabilities beyond what I could have ever expected. It&rsquo;s worth every penny, and is certainly a five star item. Actually, its much higher than that. One try, and you&rsquo;ll be hooked.</p>

<p>I bought this product a little over a year ago and would like to give it 4.5 stars, but Amazon only has the 4 or 5 star option.ProsLots of expandible storage. I currently have 200GB in mine.Long battery life. I keep mine in my gym bag and I charge if every couple of weeks.Size and weight. It&rsquo;s thin and light weight.Looks goodBluetoothHeadphones. I believe the headphones that come with it are designed to work well with them. I change different headphones for different occasions and I believe that the headphones that come with them sound better than my ER6 high end earplug headphones. The only reason I don&rsquo;t use them all the time is because they are too short to work out with and pop out of my ears while working out.Intuitive interface and controlsConsSlow boot time. It takes a long time to load all my music while turning on. If you don&rsquo;t use it regularly it seems like it takes a long time to index the music while powering up.Proprietary cableLong shape. I wish it was about an inch shorter or more.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-device-especially-for-travelers-we-ll-worth-the-investment">Excellent device especially for travelers, we&rsquo;ll worth the investment.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a music lover and I also like to travel. Many years ago I bought a pair of Bose quiet comfort 2&rsquo;s which I used along with my MP3 player when traveling. I loved the fact that the awful engine droning was quieted and I could also listen to music. The problem was size, weight and the fact that the Bose sound is pretty poor quality. I next got a Sony MP3 player that had in ear buds with noise caneclling which I used until it fell appart a few months ago. In the meantime I bought a FiioX3 music player and Grado GR10 earbuds -total cost around $600. The sound of lossless files played through audiophile earbuds is great, but suffers from the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t have noise cancelling, and so it&rsquo;s a great setup for home/office use but not for airline travel. From my experience noise cancelling degrades the signal somewhat on all players I have owned to date. So, to replace my old Sony MP3 with noise cancelling I started to look at what was out there as a replacement. The NWA26 intrigued me but I was put off by the price at $319 it was three times the cost of my old Sony MP3 player.However, the ability to play lossless files and get noise cancelling on a single device convinced me to go ahead and purchase it. I am so glad I did. The sound quality with the included noise cancelling in ear buds is really, I mean really great. It is a bit weighted towards bass, but the bass sounds rich, punchy and clear. In contrast to the old Sony MP3, which had a rather warm but woofy bass. The sound stage is great, I.e., separation between vocals and instruments is really clear and the dynamics are super. I was hoping for decent ambient noise reduction and passable sound quality, but in both departments my expectations have been vastly exceeded. In listening to music I know well I am hearing it with new energy. It&rsquo;s hard to describe and it doesn&rsquo;t have the monitor quality sound I expect from Grado, but it is really pleasing and crisp. As far as the noise cancelling I don&rsquo;t detect any drop in sound quality of the music, but the cancelling works just great. On a recent transatlantic 9 hour flight, I put them on after boarding and wore them until final approach for landing. As I took them off a baby started crying in the row behind me and the guy in the seat next to me said &ldquo;Can you believe that baby could cry for 9 hours straight?&rdquo;. I hadn&rsquo;t even been aware of the child let alone the crying. What I had been was immersed in fabulous music the whole way. I feel they almost paid for themselves with that one flight. On the topic of value, their sound is close to that of my Fiio X3/grado GR10 setup (though somewhat different sound as I stated above), and the cost of the Sony is half that of the other setup. The sound of this Sony NWA26 setup is incomparably better than that of the Bose QC2&rsquo;s, and the cost is the same. Only, for the Bose you still have to buy a player. I have to say I like the build, convenience and sound of this so much that I am listening to this more than my &ldquo;higher quality&rdquo; setup. The only additional thing you need for this setup is a small point and shoot camera case to protect the device and headphones when not in use.Another super feature is the battery life, which is listed at 50 hours. This matches my experience with it and essentially means whatever trip you are on, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of battery when you need the player.The build of the Sony and the feel of it is very high quality with precision buttons etc. The only issue I have is that I moved my FLAC files onto the device without using any proprietary software and so it hasn&rsquo;t created a library. Rather I have to go into the folder option and select the appropriate album that way. This isn&rsquo;t an issue for me and I just have to spend a bit of time figuring out how to load music on properly. One last thing, this also has a radio. I have had other players with raios and they seem to be afterthoughts that are somewhat crackly and I have ended up not using them. The radio on this one works very nicely and I don&rsquo;t have any problems with interference, which I consider to be a bonus. So what&rsquo;s the bottom line? I think Ferris Beuler put it best &ldquo;If you have the means I highly recommend it&rdquo;. Bravo SONY, this is a superb product!</p>
