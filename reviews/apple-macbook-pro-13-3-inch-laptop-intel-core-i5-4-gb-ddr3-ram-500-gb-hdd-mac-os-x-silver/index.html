<p>Product Description
The design for MacBook Pro packs a lot of power into not a lot of space; high performance shouldn&rsquo;t come at the expense of portability. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is designed with the following features to reduce environmental impact, Arsenic-free display glass, Mercury-free LED-backlit display, Brominated flame retardant free, PVC-free, Energy Efficient Ethernet enabled, Highly recyclable aluminum and glass enclosure. The new integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 processor boosts performance by up to 60 percent. That extra power gives you a smoother, more fluid experience than before. It&rsquo;s still highly efficient, too, so you get long battery life when you&rsquo;re out and about.</p>

<h5 id="macbook-air-13inch-vs-macbook-pro-13inch">macbook air 13inch vs macbook pro 13inch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this review is about my personal honest experience, i am not a computer wizard.like most of you, i had a hard time thinking which one to buy, an air or a pro. what i did is purchased the two and see which one will better suit my needs and send back the one that I won&rsquo;t like. so I went at my local best buy and did so. after using both products for 14days, here are my thoughts.the macbook air looks very beautiful on the outside. it&rsquo;s so thin and light and can be used anywhere like a tablet. to sum things up, the MB air is more of a fashion statement than a work horse. is it faster than a pro? yes only by 10-15secs during start up. the audio quality sounds thin but loud. the pro has a deeper sound. air has higher resolution but the fonts are small. what I hate about it is the screen display color. macbook pro by far has more vivid colors and if you love to watch netflix and hd videos like me, the pro is a better choice. i like the design of the air but i&rsquo;m sorry to say that it is more like a toy than a real life laptop. if you have a main computer, the air is a very good addition but if you only need an all in one computer like me to take with you, store data, watch videos, do picture and video editing and plan to use for a very long time, then the macbook pro is a better choice and for me is more sturdy. one reviewer says that the air has better screen display but I don&rsquo;t agree with that because i am an amateur photographer and im pretty sure i know which has the better display. in the long run you will be needing that dvd drive, the storage and ram that you can customize, the ethernet and ports that are already built in and most of all the screen display. the macbook pro still looks stunningly beautiful and is a more capable laptop. even the keyboard is better to type on. the air is super light weight but the pro still is light. we still need to use our muscles sometimes. battery life are identical 5-6 hrs.I got more from my money on the pro and it is a better choice for me that&rsquo;s why I kept it and sent the air back for a refund. again this is just my personal honest opinion.</p>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son LOVES it! The only places I could find that sold these are directly through Apple (which wanted WAY too much for their &ldquo;AppleCare warranty&rdquo;-it doesn&rsquo;t even cover drops,spills, etc&hellip;just a warranty to talk to to their technical support-what a joke), Best Buy (their &ldquo;Geek Squad&rdquo; warranty covers basically everything, including drops, spills, etc&hellip;but is approx. $350 for 2 yrs or $510 for 3 yrs and it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s fixed right at the store- they still send it out, so you still have a wait time until you get it back), eBay (no warranties you can add-just a transferable warranty IF the person selling added it at time of purchase), and Amazon. Amazon, by far, beat the others in price AND you can add your own warranty for a very reasonable price ( I think I paid around $150 for 3 yrs) and it covers spills, drops, cracked screen, etc. I know this model is from 2012 and is not the newer one, but in my opinion is was a way better choice. I guess it just depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for &amp; what is important to you. I didn&rsquo;t want the new MacBook Air because I was told by several sales associates at Best Buy that they have junky processors (compared to any of the MacBook Pro models, not in general), their storage/ memory options suck, and that any of the Pro models would be MUCH better for what my son would be using on it the most-Photoshop. I was told the Air models are best for people that needed easy portability, like traveling on business trips &amp; needing to check emails &amp; such. The new Pro models are very nice, but they have less storage &amp; you end up paying so much extra for the retina display. If having retina display is super important to you, then go with the new models. It wasn&rsquo;t to me. Plus, this MacBook Pro, in my opinion, has GREAT image quality&hellip;.if you put it beside one with retina, then yes-you WILL see an obvious difference between them&hellip;.but, for me, the difference wasn&rsquo;t worth the difference in price, especially beings that the image quality on this model, while not as nice as the retina, still is amazing and far better than the quality of any other laptop I compared it to of similar price. Also, a HUGE selling feature for me is that this one comes with the DVD SuperDrive built into it, which none of the newer MacBook AIrs or Pros do&hellip;.for the newer models, you can buy a SuperDrive (they were $80 at Best Buy), but you connect them with a USB cable and then you&rsquo;re stuck with a laptop, SuperDrive, and a wire attaching them and that&rsquo;s not very ideal if your traveling &amp; want your kid to be able to watch a DVD. Also, with this model, you can upgrade the 500 GB to a higher one, if you need to. That&rsquo;s always a nice option, which again, the newer models do not come with and are not capable of. Do your research &amp; pick what&rsquo;s best for your personal needs. This model, while SLIGHTLY heavier than the new ones, is still very lightweight (and remember-this one has the SuperDrive built into it, so that compensates for the little bit of extra weight, which is only like 1lb.). I&rsquo;m so happy with this MacBook Pro&hellip;.and thrilled with the additional warranty options&hellip;.and, most important of all, my 13 yr. old son LOVES it&hellip;he got it for Christmas and definitely wasn&rsquo;t expecting it and the pure look of shock and happiness on his face when he opened it was absolutely PRICELESS. (He wanted &amp; asked for a laptop and, even though he has an iPhone, an iPod touch, and a iPad with retina, he didn&rsquo;t bother asking for a MacBook because, as he said, &ldquo;I would love a MacBook, but I know they&rsquo;re basically the most expensive laptops out there, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter-I&rsquo;m fine with a any laptop-it doesn&rsquo;t have to be super expensive&rdquo;. Through my research, I was told over &amp; over again that Apple products are pricier because the quality &amp; durability far exceeds any other brand, which is why they can charge more. So I made the decision to get him a MacBook&hellip;plus he can, and has, synced it to all his other Apple devices, so all his songs and apps are all there w/o the need to spend additional money. Boy-was he surprised!) He spends hours every day making &ldquo;edits&rdquo; (sports pics) with PhotoShop (which is now sold by subscription, which I also bought on Amazon-it arrives &amp; looks like a gift card, which is super nice if you&rsquo;re giving it as a gift). Really, truly, honestly a great buy and a great product.</p>
