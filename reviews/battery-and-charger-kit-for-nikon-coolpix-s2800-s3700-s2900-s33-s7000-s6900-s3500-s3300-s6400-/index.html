<p>Extended Replacement Battery For Nikon EN-EL19 Battery 1000MAh:</p>

<p>Every photographer’s worst nightmare is running out of battery power just as they are about to take the best shot of their lives. Sadly, this is a common issue caused by a failure to plan ahead, or because they chose to purchase low quality camera batteries.</p>

<p> A Spare Rechargeable Battery Is An Essential Accessory. No Power, No Pictures!</p>

<p>The Replacement for Nikon EN-EL19 Rechargeable Lithium-ion Battery Pack has a capacity of 1000mAh, making it possible to shoot many pictures and Videos with your New Nikon Digital Camera on a single battery charge. There is no memory effect, so you can recharge partially drained batteries without reducing performance, so they never lose their ability to hold a full charge. The battery is fully compatible with the Nikon original camera, battery, and power accessories.
This Replacement EN-EL19 battery is Fully Decoded which allows it to communicate with the Nikon series cameras, so that you can always check the remaining capacity, shutter count and recharge performance on the cameras power source info screen.</p>

<p>Ac/Dc Home and Car Rapid Travel Charger For Nikon EN-EL19 Battery:</p>

<p>Power Up Your Battery With This Convenient Travel Charger.</p>

<p>With most digital cameras and camcorders the only way you can charge your battery is is by having it placed in the camera while charging it via USB or a wall outlet, leaving you without a camera and missing out on those precious moments you may never get back. With this external charger, you can now charge a spare battery and use the camera at the same time.</p>

<p>This Multi-Voltage Rapid Battery Charger plugs directly in to a standard wall outlet or your car&rsquo;s 12V DC outlet, and charges your EN-EL19 battery in approximately 60 to 90 minutes. Its flat-pin, foldable design allows easy storage and makes it the most compact battery charger on the market! In addition, this charger includes a European adapter plug for use in 250V outlets.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I shopped around for a charger and extra battery for my camera for a couple of months. I could not find an extra battery that came with the charger. For a battery alone, it would have cost $30 and then the charger would have been $40-$50. So when I saw that I could get both for $20, I was a little skeptical. It came in 2 days early and works great. The screen protectors and cloth were just an added bonus. This is a great product, and I would recommend it to everyone. For $20 you can&rsquo;t go wrong. Best product for the best price!!</p>

<h5 id="add-ons-prevent-photo-power-failure">Add-Ons Prevent Photo Power Failure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good deal and good protection against missed shots for my new Nikon Coolpix S-4100. Thanks to spare battery and charger kit from Butterfly Photo, we saw the sights and got the pictures to prove it in Montreal this summer. Camera comes with one battery and a cord to charge it inside the camera, but I prefer to use a separate charger that plugs directly into the wall, and like to always have a fully charged battery in reserve. Butterfly filled the bill on both counts at a very reasonable price, and also threw in a protector and cleaning cloth for my tiny camera&rsquo;s touchscreen. Great deal and excellent service!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-and-charger-for-nikon-coolpix">Battery and charger for Nikon Coolpix</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I inadvertently plugged the wrong charger into my Nikon Coolpix and damaged the connection - Nikon wanted almost as much as the camera was worth to fix it, so I looked for an external charger to try to solve the problem. I purchased the extra battery and charger from Butterfly, and it arrived at my house within days and is the perfect solution to my problem. I appreciate the fast fulfillment of my order, and I appreciate that Butterfly called about two weeks after I received the item to make sure it was what I wanted and that it was working properly.Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-charger">Battery Charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The charger works well, but it ca be confusing to use. There are four different ways the battery can be loaded into the charger, but only one way will charge the battery. The instructions do not tell you the correct way to load the battery. The only way to be sure the battery is correctly loaded is if the charging light is red</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-for-the-money">Great product for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery is new and works as advertised. It comes with all the mentioned items, sealed and new. My battery came in its own box, and inside it&rsquo;s own reusable plastic case. It was fully charged upon arrival. I&rsquo;ll buy another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-though-i-was-a-little-confused-as-the-battery">works great though I was a little confused as the battery &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received it quickly, works great though I was a little confused as the battery did not fit in the way I expected. As it works with several different batteries, it took a few tries to get it in so it actually charged, but once it was in correctly, it charged quickly. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="in-the-sun">In the sun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First, no shade because it does work and fit my camera. But imagine how taken aback I was when the product stated &ldquo;vivitar&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Nikon&rdquo;. So, I was a little leary, but charged the enclosed battery and prepared to use it. And I did, and it was fine. Had I seen the vivitar name on the product prior to ordering, I may not have ordered it and probably would have paid more for one worth Nikon on it. Now that it&rsquo;s inside my camera, and working, who cares?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="glad-to-be-able-to-use-my-camera-again">Glad to be able to use my camera again!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wish I had read what is included, I skipped right over CAR charger, which I do not need, having no car. But the other charger is just dandy! Love it! I HAD regular charger but lost it.</p>
