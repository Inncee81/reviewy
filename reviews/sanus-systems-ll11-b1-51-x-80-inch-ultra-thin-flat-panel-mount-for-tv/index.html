<h5 id="this-was-a-great-mount-i-installed-this-for-my-samsung-75">This was a great mount. I installed this for my Samsung 75&rdquo; &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a great mount. I installed this for my Samsung 75&rdquo; smart TV. This mount is super slim and can be a little difficult to attach the TV to it. There are workarounds though.Behind my TV I have a recessed outlet and HDMI keystones. I also have 4 HDMI&rsquo;s connected to the TV. The HDMI&rsquo;s cables connected from the wall needed an HDMI elbow adapter. Without the elbows, I would never of been able to connect them.On the back of the TV, the inputs for HDMI also needed elbow adapters.The cool feature about the TV is being able to get to the back of the TV without removing it. If you fit your hands behind the TV from the bottom, there are 2 strings. When you pull these down, it releases part of the mount and you are able to tilt the TV forward from the bottom. There are legs that pop out to hold the TV on the wall so that you can do cable management or add other cables. Once done, you hold the TV and push the legs in. ddd</p>

<h5 id="nice-design-convenient-snap-in-and-snap-out-mechanism-ultra-low-profile-but">Nice design, convenient snap-in and snap-out mechanism, ultra-low profile, but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year I mounted a 46&rdquo; LCD screen using the cheaper Cheetah mount. It was OK, but for my next project ( mounting a 55&rdquo; screen) i wanted to try something with a lower profile. The Cheetah offers a mounting surface 1.3&rdquo; away from the wall, while the Sanus offers a very low .55&rdquo;. As it turned out, the LG 55LA7400 I was dealing with cannot be mounted this close to the wall! Even though the HDMI inputs are parallel to the wall, the bottom part of the TV includes an enclosure (that houses the speakers and the wireless network adapter) that protrudes out more than half an inch. However, the Sanus mounting kit comes with 3 different sizes of spacers and assorted M6 screws. The problem is that to use the shortest spacer, the screws provided are too big. (They provide a quarter inch and 3-quarter inch long M6 screws, but to use the shortest spacer, you need a half-inch long screw. A quick run to the hardware store was necessary to finish the installation).I like the design of the mount: behind each of the vertical support bars you see in the picture, there is a quick-release mechanism activated by pulling a cord down. Moreover, once you pull on the quick-release cords and pull the TV away from the wall, two plastic stops pop out and let you have the TV rest against the wall giving you access to the back panel to insert/remove cables.If you end up using the medium spacer, the mounting surface will be more than 1 inch away from the wall, nullifying the low-profile design. Which is what you could have achieved with a mount a third of the price of the Sanus. Such as the Cheetah, which by the way lets you tilt the TV +/- 10 degrees, something that the Sanus by the virtue of its ultra-low profile design cannot.Pros:- Ultra low profile (just check that you can make use of it!)- Good build quality and a nice design- Easy snap-in TV mounting and convenient quick-release mechanism (by pulling down on a cord).- Easy access to the back panel of your TV (provided by two plastic spacers once you pull the TV away from the wall)Cons (a third of a star deducted for each):- The price is a bit extreme. It&rsquo;s 3 times more expensive than the Cheetah.- Most of the mounts from competitors include a built-in level to make mounting easier. These things are cheap and Sanus could have thrown one in there for 80$.- Did not include the proper screw size for the smallest spacers.Summary:The ultra-low profile can justify the price. In the case of my fancy LG TV, I had to use spacers, which defeats the purpose. So in hindsight I should i have gone for the Cheetah for less than a third of the price. With the option to tilt. But I still recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="like-it-but-more-challenging-to-install-than-i-thought">Like it, but more challenging to install than I thought.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this after a recommendation of a friend and I like it. Obviously the biggest pro is the low profile design and it certainly met my expectation on that while also appearing very sturdy.At the same time, you also need to watch a few things and make sure these will not be an issue before you start the install.1) There is absolutely no space for any cable to pass through where the metal bars are. plan your wall sockets and connections accordingly. I used this to install a new 65&rdquo; Samsung SUHD TV that come with a 7ft. proprietary cable. In the past a 6ft HDMI was previously sufficient to reach my cabinet under the tv and now the Samsung connection box is hanging at the rear of the cabinet as a large chunk of the cable simply got used to maneuver the metal bars.2) You have to have a recessed power connection as well. Very small tabs hold the vertical bars fixed on the horizontal bar and any cable bulk that does not allow the TV to be perfectly perpendicular to the floor would not allow the tabs to secure the TV. Samsung comes with L shaped power bracket which is much lower profile than others I saw, yet still it did not work and added another step to my install.It sure was much more hassle than I hoped for during the install vs. any of my prior LED TV installs where the mount was not as low profile. Once the pain is over, it looks great though!</p>

<h5 id="1-2-mount-looks-great"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; mount looks great&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mounting system really is as low-profile as it gets. Just consider a couple things before purchasing; Most televisions don&rsquo;t account for the cables sticking out once connected. The power, hdmi, and rca&rsquo;s all will stick out approx <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to 1 inch when connected- which means the mount won&rsquo;t secure into place as the cords are jammed against the wall. In my case I did a little demolition work to the dry wall and even had to notch out a stud to get the cables to fit behind the TV. I had already ran a pvc conduit to snake the cables behind the wall and into a cabinet, but it took a decent amount of time to measure out where I cut out drywall to line up with where the cable/component connections would be. If you are planning on having the TV in the same location forever then it shouldnt be an issue- but if it might be moved at some point you should probably stick with a standard mount that allows enough room for the cables behind it. In the end my 50&rdquo; plasma looks awesome with this low-pro mount.</p>

<p>Best mount. We have it on all our TV&rsquo;s. Have used this one for years. Easy for a man to install.</p>

<h5 id="very-slim-mount-works-great-with-a-heavy-but-thin-tv">Very slim mount, works great with a heavy but thin TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely thin mount, but very strong and easy to install. This mount is holding an LG 98UB980V, which is about 120lb.</p>

<h5 id="looks-great-good-installation">Looks great. Good installation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The back plate, which supports the weight of the TV when on the wall, should have more slots for the lag bolts in the center/middle area.</p>

<p>Sleek design. Works great and easy to install. The only issue I had was the lag bolts. I went and got new ones and it turned out great</p>

<h5 id="a-pain-to-install-but-good-now-that-it-s-done">A pain to install but good now that it&rsquo;s done</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this mount to install a Samsung 75&rdquo; TV (UN75JU7100) and had some challenges, mostly due to Samsung&rsquo;s product design.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-and-easy-to-install">Very nice and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice and easy to install. I do suggest that Sanus extend the oblong screw mount pattern to the end on both sides of this unit (the wall mount plate).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-definitely-ultra-slim-keep-in">This is definitely ultra slim&hellip; keep in &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is definitely ultra slim&hellip;keep in mind how your TV protrudes in the back and possibly install a recessed outlet for the power cord.</p>
