<h5 id="a-solid-premium-compact-that-produces-great-photos">A Solid Premium Compact that Produces Great Photos</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II is the updated version of Canon’s G9 X “entry level” premium compact camera. I was looking for a small camera to take along with me when I did not want to lug around a DSLR camera and lenses. After much research, I settled on the PowerShot G9 X Mark II and so far, I am very pleased with the results.The premium compact cameras give the user the option to manually control settings (shutter speed, aperture, ISO), while also offering the traditional “Auto” point and shoot mode, as well as other creative settings typically found on a point and shoot. These cameras also feature a 1” CMOS sensor, which produces better images than a typical cell phone camera.Updates to the Mark II version include the Digic VII image processor, which means faster processing and continuous shooting times for JPEG and RAW photos (a maximum continuous shooting speed of 8.2 fps in RAW shooting mode). The Mark II also features dual sensing image stabilization, a quicker autofocus feature and improved subject tracking, auto shooting mode, and a slight improvement in battery life.The Mark II also is Bluetooth compatible, a new feature (the camera also has Wi-Fi and NFC capabilities). Transferring photos from the camera to your phone is easy with the Canon Camera Connect app.I have used the camera for a few weeks and I like it. The camera is small (it can literally fit in my front pocket) and the large 3” touchscreen is relatively intuitive (the camera has a limited amount of buttons). The user can control mostly everything via the touchscreen, and I have found that visibility of the screen is still very good for daylight shooting.The lens range itself is limited, but what you lose in zoom you make up for in quality photos and compactness. The focal length in the lens of the Canon G9X II is 28mm-84mm, with a 3X optical zoom and a 12x digital zoo, which will produce grainy photos. Maximum aperture is F/2 at 28mm and F4.9 at 84mm. I have attached photos that show what is captured at 28mm, 50mm, 84mm and at maximum zoom. The zoom on this camera will not give you close ups of the moon. The lens barrel also has a ring, which can be used to control a variety of settings. There is no viewfinder.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera. The only negative at this point has been battery life, but the battery life I have experienced may have been comprised since I have been setting up the camera and using its various features. Still, it probably makes sense to buy and carry a spare battery if you are going to be out all day shooting. Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="best-compact-travel-pns-camera-imho">Best Compact Travel PnS Camera IMHO.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best compact travel camera I have ever owned.No camera is perfect. It&rsquo;s just the matter of where you are willing to make compromise. In term of light traveling camera, this is as good as you can get. The camera is truly pocketable, decent focal range, grate image quality. Wifi is a big bonus since I travel without a laptop and can transfer photos over to my iPhone to edit and post on social media during the trip. The photos include in my review are shot in jpg (with neutral setting) and lightly touch-up/re-frame with iPhone Photoshop app.I have used Sony RX-100 (v1-v3), Canon S90-S120, and G9 X mark1 in my traveling and so far this G9 X Mk2 is my favorite.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-camera">Great little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great little camera. Honestly if you want the highest image quality in the smallest profile possible, this camera is it.Is it worth upgrading from the original though? I guess it depends on what&rsquo;s important to you. If you feel that you would use the in camera raw processing and more in depth adjustments for picture styles then its worth considering. While it&rsquo;s JPEGS are slightly sharper due to the newer processor, overall image quality is about the same. The photos look great with excellent color reproduction and the auto white balance has improved a bit over its predecessor. Video quality is also very good.The overall layout of the camera is essentially the same at its predecessor. You only get one control dial and have to rely on the touch screen for the rest of setting adjustments. But as with other cameras, the touch screen works great so this might not be as big of a deal as it seems. Ergonomics are pretty good for such a small camera. With a nice textured surface up front for a more secure grip.Autofocus performance has improved over the original G9X, mainly in the form of being less sluggish and more accurate in low light conditions. Movie AF has improved a bit too with less back and forth motion while focusing over the original.Battery life has also improved like it did on the G7X Mark II. Although if you&rsquo;re taking this out for a long day of shooting, you still might pack an extra one. Enthusiast compacts in general don&rsquo;t have the greatest battery life.Overall, this is a likeable little camera that does photos and videos very well and is slim enough to fit in most pockets. Some may find the lens too restrictive as far as focal length is concerned but that&rsquo;s one of the tradeoffs you have to make when you stuff a larger sensor in a small camera body. If you have the original G9X, this is not the no-brainer upgrade. But if you&rsquo;re a new buyer to this series, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to spend the extra money to get the Mark II for the extra features and slight bump in overall performance it provides.</p>

<h5 id="great-point-and-shoot-camera">Great Point and Shoot Camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did good deal of research before making my decision on this model. The competiton includes the Canon Gx7 and various Sony, Nikon and Lumix models. This camera by spec Is a lesser model to these competitors (all have 1 inch sensors which I wanted for superior low light shots), but they also cost 150 to 400 dollars more! If you are an a amature enthusiast like me and probably do not need great manual flexibility (although this model has some flexibility), and want a very good P and S to use instead of you cell phone, I would highly recommend this model.</p>
