<h5 id="much-better-than-i-expected">Much better than I expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical to buy this camera given that it had only review and even that was negative. But I went ahead anyway. I purchased it for my Hawaii trip where I was expecting to be on the beach and also snorkeling. I have had several digital cameras (canon/nikon) and also DSLRs. The quality of picture is actually very much comparable to my canon Elph 530HS. Bonus is I could take this one to water. I took it snorkeling one day and took several pictures and videos under water. Quality of pictures underwater was surprisingly good. But that will depend on the day and how much sunlight was going under the water. I took it about 5 feet deep into the water and no leak or damage. For the price I think it definitely is a good buy. BTW it also takes great picture out of the water ! Only thing I have not tried is taking pictures at night. Attaching a couple of pictures.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-waterproof-camera-for-the-price-great-memories-captured-for-us-to-remember-our-cruise">Excellent Waterproof Camera for the Price! Great memories captured for us to remember our cruise!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this camera for a cruise knowing that a lot of water would be involved. My husband tested the camera in our swimming pool, prior to the cruise, and incurred zero problems. We are pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos. We were very surprised at how long it kept a charge. We went snorkeling and used the video for over an hour straight and continued to take pictures all day&hellip;only a quarter of the charge had been used.You can see the clarity of the camera by the photos in Jamaica. We were moving down river and I was still able to capture great shots. The underwater shots were in Cozumel and it was very windy that day, but the pictures and videos came out great. The camera was great in Grand Cayman. My husband took excellent videos of the stingrays. Unfortunately, I cannot get them to post here.We highly recommend this camera. It exceeded our expectations and captured great memories of our cruise!</p>

<h5 id="for-the-price-this-is-a-great-camera-but-it-does-take-a-long-time">For the price this is a great camera, but it does take a long time &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price this is a great camera, but it does take a long time to focus on something. If you don&rsquo;t wait for it to focus the pictures are almost always ruined. This is not a highspeed camera at all. I haven&rsquo;t tried it underwater, but I have seen pictures from other&rsquo;s and I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to use it underwater. Best water application I can think of is if you were in a downpour, and either had no way to keep it dry or you were taking pictures out in the rain. Other camera&rsquo;s would definitely be toast.Update 05/17/2017 - We are buying a new camera. This camera is the absolute worst in low light situations. The videos that you can take are almost always ruined by the fact that the microphone picks up everything around the camera, including just handling the camera. Shaking the camera just a little shows up so badly in the videos they are unusable. Any time you take a picture in low light using any one of the auto settings shows up blurry in the pictures. When I say low light I want to emphasize that any indoor application that has lights inside is too low of light. The auto flash hardly ever goes off and is totally useless in its application.</p>

<h5 id="happy">Happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera is easy to set up and is very easy to get to different menu&rsquo;s. Happy with the camera and looking forward to using it on the Great Barrier Reef when I snorkel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-really-waterproof">Not really waterproof</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera for a vacation we had planned in Mexico. I thought it would be fun to take pictures in the pool and in the ocean where we would normally not bring our camera and this camera seemed like a good deal compared to some more expensive models. I guess you get what you pay for. We followed all of the directions and recommendations, but after only a couple of times in the pool we noticed water forming on the inside of the camera display. It dried and we did not think much of it. Then we started to notice water spots forming inside the lens which was a real problem because the pictures ended up blurry with spots on them. It&rsquo;s a shame because it did take decent pictures when it worked correctly and we were able to get some fun underwater shots, but unfortunately we ended up returning the camera when we got home since it did not hold up to its waterproof claim.</p>
