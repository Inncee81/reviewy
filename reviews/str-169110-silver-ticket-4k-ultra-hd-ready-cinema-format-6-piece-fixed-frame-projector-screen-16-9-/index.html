Silver Ticket Products Fixed Frame projection screens feature professional quality and performance. Our screens are built using authentic cinema-screen vinyl vs the cheap materials used by other brands. Silver Ticket screen material is built from an elastic, high-quality, white vinyl which features a 1.1 gain reflectivity, enhancing the movie watching experience.  The superior quality of the screens’ reflective properties bring added life to the vibrant colors and high resolution images produced by your projector.</p>

<p>Silver Ticket Products screens are quick and easy to assemble due to our Tension Rod System.  All four sides of the screen are built with a specially designed pocket that accommodates a lightweight rod.   The rods are easily attached to the frame, creating just the right amount of tension on the screen to remove any wrinkles in the material and produce a flawless viewing surface. The entire Tension Rod System is neatly hidden, and the frame can be easily mounted to a wall much like a large picture. The sturdy aluminum frame is WRAPPED, not flocked, with a light-absorbing black velvet fabric that absorbs over-projected light. While other brands use square tubing in their frames, Silver Ticket screens are built with durable extruded aluminum that contours down to the projected image.  Join thousands of satisfied Silver Ticket customers &ndash; get your Silver Ticket screen today!</p>

<h5 id="great-screen">Great screen</h5>

<p>I watched the the 5 youtube videos that silver ticket has up in order to get the assembly down. The center post gives people problems. After the screen was attached to all the clips, I released the screen from the two top/center clips and two bottom/center clips (where the center posts gets wedged in). Then, with far end of the center post in the groove of the frame, I was able to use my index fingers and thumbs to force the post and frame away from one another just enough for the end of the post to drop down into the groove. I then re-attached the screen to the top and bottom center clips.I attached two <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; hooks ($.98 from HD) and have the screen hanging in front of my plasma which is mounted to the wall behind it. I had previously had an elite B model pull down screen hanging from very strong wire through the ceiling and screwed to ceiling joists. I could no longer take all the wrinkles and waves of the pull-down screen. This screen is only about 20 lbs or so I&rsquo;m guessing. It&rsquo;s easy to hang without help. I just lean it against a wall in a side room when using the plasma tv behind it, which is most of the time.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-product-and-outstanding-customer-support">Fantastic Product and Outstanding Customer Support&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this screen just over a month ago, initially I had intending on another brand but noticed this was on offer, and really the price for a 150” screen I couldn&rsquo;t turn my back on it.I had the projector already, so I knew the size I was looking for, I have built my own attic out to be a projector/cinema room. The screen arrived quickly (prime) and was well packaged, very well indeed. I got to setting up the screen right away, instructions are simple and good. One thing to note, the only tough part is the final pulling of the screen onto the frame, mine caused the edge in to pull away just a little from the bar (see picture), not enough to notice it on the front, but enough for me to be concerned.I mounted the whole thing with my own 2 x 50lbs (100 total) drywall mounts, the whole process took me (alone) about 1 half hours.Concerned that the corner might come away more and I’d start to see the edge pull away, I contacted the company and sent them an email with a photo. I had a quick response saying that it shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, I could staple it, however, and these are their words &ldquo;We want you to be happy and have the best experience possible with our product&rdquo; so on single reply, they shipped a second background out to me just on the off chance I needed it in the future. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but any company that looks after their customers like that and stands by their product, deserves a hats off.Not only is their customer service second to none, their product is solid, well built and is a sight of beauty. I give this product and the support of it 5 stars.I love my screen, and thank you Silver Ticket, thank you very much.POLOMiNT</p>

<h5 id="a-surprisingly-good-screen-for-not-a-lot-of-money">A surprisingly good screen, for not a lot of money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a rather surprisingly good screen, for not a lot of money. I started out the search by considering a DIY approach, but after tallying the cost of materials and some tools that i didn&rsquo;t have, this turned out to be about $40 cheaper, easier and quicker to set-up, and looks rather professional at the same time.I think the manufacturer did a good job packaging the item as well. Each component was either in its own box, or plastic bag. It was almost like opening a matryoshka &ndash; box inside a box inside&hellip; you get the idea. :)The relevant components were also wrapped with foam on the tips and all components, other than a screw (more in a bit), just screamed quality IMHO. The bar that connects the two halves is one solid chunk of aluminum.Each screw and such is in its own bag, which makes it easier to sort out and figure what is needed where. There was enough of every piece to build the screen, with at least one extra screw or hook left over. I&rsquo;m glad there was an extra screw because one didn&rsquo;t have a hole on the head lol! :DSet-up took no more than an hour, and this was with breaks. It was just so easy to build, i just can&rsquo;t understand why some reviews say it&rsquo;s difficult. Even stretching the screen could be done with one hand.The only time i needed help was mounting it to the wall, as it&rsquo;s a fairly wide screen and you&rsquo;ll need someone on the other end to lift it up.The screen material itself looks good to me, i&rsquo;m no videophile so can&rsquo;t really comment about gain and all that. But it&rsquo;s as good as the Da-Lite (4:3) that i had prior to this. Viewing angle is pretty good, and i had to turn down my projector brightness a bit to work with this screen.Overall, a great buy for a great price and it looks rather professional too.</p>
