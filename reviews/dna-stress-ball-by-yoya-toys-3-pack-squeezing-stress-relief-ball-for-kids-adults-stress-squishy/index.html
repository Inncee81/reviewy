<h5 id="i-am-so-very-happy-with-these-stress-balls">I am so very happy with these stress balls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am so very happy with these stress balls. My son is extremely happy with these and that makes them completely worth it. My son has been asking for stress balls specifically. He has even tried making some homemade ones following instructions he found online but they broke so easily. He was constantly disappointed. he has placed the DNA stress balls through everything a child can do with it and the only thing that has happened is they got dirty. A quick wash with a sanitizing wipe and good as new. Highly recommended from an elementary boy and his mother!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="relieves-stress">Relieves stress</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These DNA stress balls by YoYa Toys are great. I bought them for my son who suffers from ADHD and gets stressed very easily. He needs something to keep his hands busy and has fidgets, but I thought that a stress ball may help him relieve more stress. These balls are great. They are made of good durable materials that can withstand a lot of torment from a 12 year old boy. He really likes the way they feel and that they have all of they other balls inside that he cannot get out. He has been using this for about a week now and it seems to be helping him to manage his stress a little better. I plan to allow him to take one of these to school with him to see if this will help him deal with the stressors of school.</p>

<h5 id="a-little-squish-for-young-and-old">A little squish for young and old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is great for people who need to squeeze there anger out. The rubber is nice and strong and it&rsquo;s also flexible. The multicolor balls in the stress ball gives it lots of color and gives the ball life. The skin on the ball might get dirty after a lot of uses but it doesn&rsquo;t change the quality of the ball. I have had to wash it a couple times at first because hair as well as other things just got stuck to the ball. The ball may stretch out just a little but you can still use it just the same. All the balls inside give a nice little massage to your hands to.</p>

<h5 id="they-are-so-fun">They are so fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these because i work in a high stress environment where our clients are very anxious and nervous. These things really help to calm them down especially when they have children with them. My son is almost 2 and he immediately grabbed one and wouldn&rsquo;t let it go all afternoon. They are fun and not easily breakable as my little munster has tried several times to puncture the sac.I like them and will for sure buy some more</p>

<h5 id="my-kids-love-it">My kids love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids love these stress balls (ages 11 and 3). Since we received them, they are constantly playing with them. It especially keeps them busy on car rides so they aren&rsquo;t as bored. They are extremely durable and took a good beating from my 3 year old and it&rsquo;s still holding up strong so it passed that test. Love that it came in a pack of three!</p>

<h5 id="fun-stress-balls-for-any-age">Fun stress balls for any age</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are fun stress balls for any age. The are soft and easy to use and seem to be strong and durable. They&rsquo;re also good for exercising arthritic hands. I kept one for myself and gave the other two to my grandsons and they love them - glad there were three in the pack!</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-and-if-you-buy-them-for-your-children">Highly recommended and if you buy them for your children</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These stress balls are strong and are able to take a beating! I purchased them for our kids, ages 8,9 and 15&hellip;they each got one. They have had them for a week and they are still intact! I even tried to squeeze it so one would break and it didnt happen. I would rather have these than the handmade stress balls made out of balloons that break and get cornstarch stuff all over. Highly recommended and if you buy them for your children, you will find yourself wanting to keep one close to you as well!</p>
