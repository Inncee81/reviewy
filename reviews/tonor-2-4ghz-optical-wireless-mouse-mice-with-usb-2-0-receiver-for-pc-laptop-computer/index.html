<h5 id="very-easy-to-install">Very easy to install!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I bought this wireless mouse! I plugged in the accompanying USB and the mouse worked in literally two seconds. It feels sturdy and not like cheap plastic. The only gripe I have is that they could have at least provided a battery with the product. I have noticed what other reviewers said about the annoying sleep mode the mouse enters if you don&rsquo;t use it for 10 minutes, but it&rsquo;s really not that bad. You turn the mouse over and click the on/off switch. Voila! It&rsquo;s back on. Other people seemed to make it out to be such a big deal to power it back up, but it was pretty simple. Do I wish that it didn&rsquo;t enter sleep mode? Ummm, YES! But since it does, it&rsquo;s really not a hassle to get it going again. Then again, that&rsquo;s just my humble opinion. Try it out for yourself and see. I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="gold-pretty-and-it-works-going-on-one-year">Gold, pretty, and it works! Going on one year!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this. Bought it just so I could have something gold in my office for work. I feel it is perfect for a small to medium hand&ndash;larger hands might find it too small to be comfortable. The only other pitfall is the battery seems to drain more than other wireless mouses (mice?). It doesn&rsquo;t bother me another to give it 4 stars. Just change the battery. Enjoy this responsive and pretty office accessory.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-little-gold-mouse">Awesome little gold mouse!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this mouse every day since June/July. I get so many compliments on it! It is so cute! However, It is pretty sensitive, but I got used to it quick. It feels like a really good size, not too small. I don&rsquo;t use a mousepad with it, just leave it on my desk. I also take it with me if I know I have a lot of work to do when I&rsquo;m not at my desk. I haven&rsquo;t had to replace the battery yet, I make sure to turn it off every night, but it also sleeps to save battery life. I didn&rsquo;t need to set it up, just plugged it in and it immediately started working. Love this mouse!Edit: 6 months later and this mouse still works pretty good. I just replaced the battery for the first time. My only complaint is when my computer starts now it takes the mouse a little while to warm up. For the first 5 minutes it&rsquo;s on it thinks the left button is the right button, so both buttons right-click for at least 5 minutes. It eventually snaps out of it and works normal but it&rsquo;s pretty annoying and for the price I may just order a new one and keep this as a backup. Still happy with it though and get a lot of compliments on it!</p>

<h5 id="very-cute">Very Cute.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better than basic black for my office, bought a cute mouse pad to coordinate too. At first I felt the move moved too fast across the screen, however I found out that can be adjusted in the instructions. It is also not a mini mouse which is good.UPDATE: After a year of use the scroll turned from white to green. Also the mouse is not as responsive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-purchase-works-well">Good purchase, works well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very cute little gold mouse. Goes perfect with my wood/floral theme going on in my cubicle. I will say that it&rsquo;s VERY sensitive though! I have double screens and one teensy swipe gets me across both screens! It&rsquo;s ok, I guess I got used to the old school wired one that was assigned to me. This will just take a day to get used to. Other than that, I love it. The picture does make it look more of a rose gold, but no, it&rsquo;s more of a dark yellowish gold. Still pretty though. Also, the roller thing is tan, not white. Minor issue, just saying.The light is blue underneath and you cannot see it when lit AT ALL, which I think is cool. Some others I have seen show the glow, making them look cheap. One star taken for the misleading color.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="won-t-connect">Won&rsquo;t connect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>None of my computers can find this mouse through the Bluetooth feature which is the only way to connect it.UpdateI have received a message from this company. They seem very eager to correct the problem. I believe they will, so I raised it by 2 stars. When this gets fixed I will be happy to give 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-gold-mouse">The perfect gold mouse!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So happy I found this beautiful gold mouse! When I decided to cave in to the pink and gold trend for my office I knew I found lots of great pink mouse pads right away, but gold mice are not as easy to come by&hellip; of the few I found, this was the only well reviewed one so I trusted in that and am super happy with the result! This mouse works like a charm - MUCH better than my expensive Apple mouse ever did, for a fraction of the cost, and it looks so chic to boot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Use this at work as our office mice are terrible. Cute color, very smooth, user friendly. Well packaged and came with a business card to contact the business directly with any issues - love that!</p>

<h5 id="good-for-short-term-use">good for short term use</h5>

<p>Dies easily&hellip; I like it but it will not last longer than a year and the scroll button turns blue&hellip;</p>

<p>This wireless mouse worked fine right off the bat with my Windows 7 laptop computer. After 6 months, however, the scroll wheel started moving the cursor in the opposite direction&hellip;</p>
