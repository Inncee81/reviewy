<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The X7 Mark II ushers in a new era for lossless music players with its completely redesigned internals and updated exterior. From the iconic machined volume wheel to refined surface finishes and bold sculpted lines, the X7 Mark II represents the pinnacle of FiiO&rsquo;s music player design.</p>

<p>Take All Your Music
With 64GB built-in flash storage and two micro SD card slots each capable of supporting 256GB cards, the X7 Mark II is able to hold over 570GB of music, enough for over 19,000 lossless music files. Truly, this is a player that can take your whole music collection along wherever you go.</p>

<p>Flagship DAC
Forming the foundation of the X7 Mark II&rsquo;s audio prowess is the 8-channel ESS ES9028PRO DAC, with an exceptional signal-to-noise ratio of 129dB and remarkable total harmonic distortion plus noise floor of -120dB. The result is more resolving power, better dynamics, and superior soundstage over its predecessor.</p>

<p>Modular Amplifier Design
Shipping with the X7 Mark II is our new AM3A amplifier module, an all new design with both single-ended and balanced headphone output. Inside the AM3A is the widely acclaimed AD8620 wide bandwidth JFET op-amp, as well an OPA926 op-amp that is exclusively tailor-made for the X7 Mark II to meet the stringent requirements of FiiO Engineer&rsquo;s design. Other amplifier modules are also available that can be easily swapped out to gain desired performance characteristics.</p>

<p>Digital to Analog Done Right
Avoiding the design compromise of shared oscillators, the X7 Mark II uses three separate crystal isolators: one each for multiples of 44.1kHz and 48kHz sampling rates, as well as a dedicated oscillator for 384kHz. This design guarantees radically reduced jitter, increased clock precision and stability, and therefore more accurate signal conversion from digital to analog.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fiio-delivered">Fiio Delivered!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding entry into Fiio&rsquo;s lineup. Sound is better than expected, especially the balanced output. A very engulfing sound that maintains a clear, wide soundstage. Hits all the right notes sonically. Highs and mids are sublime, and the bass is clean, deep, and punchy. One of very few devices that shines due to musicality, rather than technicality. And excellent shipping. Received 4 days earlier than stated. Love, love, love it!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="last-fiio-product-i-ll-buy">Last FIIO Product I&rsquo;ll Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After the first download the unit locked up on me. I did download about 350 GB of songs and I wonder if that had something to do with it. I have about another 300 GB I want to get on there this afternoon so we will see what it does after that. All in all it&rsquo;s a decent unit with decent sound. I was originally attracted to this because of the large storage size as I have well over 1T of files I would like mobile. I will see how it handles the other 300 GB of files. If it does not do well, I&rsquo;m sending it back. I&rsquo;ve already decided to send back the unopened headphones that I bought from this company. Photo below is of the lock screen that required a reset almost right out of the box.Well after loading another 200 GB of FLAC files this piece of garbage gets demoted from two stars to one. If I could give it zero, I would. This is the most glitchey player, or tech devise in general, I have ever owned. At least half of the time I have to reset the damn thing just to get it to play music. All updates have been done and I am tiered of having to do a hard reset anytime I wan to listen to it. Spend some money on software FIIO. I have included two more pictures of lock screens that required a hard reset. Funny thing is that it happens at different times. The unit sounds good when it works but rarely works properly. Buy another product.</p>

<h5 id="verdict-still-out-update-08-23-17-excellent-dap-totl">Verdict still out-update 08/23/17 Excellent DAP TOTL</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased mine when they first released. I have an X3,X5,K5 and other FiiO products. I like the sound. The unit was quick and easy to setup with beautiful SQ. MIne had a defective Balance input connector so I had to return it. Now it looks as if they are on backorder.Update 08/23/17Seller promptly contacted me and sent replacement unit (must have pulled some strings as they were sold out!) Anyway I received the new unit a day earlier than expected. All I can say is it has a very expansive soundstage and the instrument separaton is excellent! I have quite a few DAP&rsquo;s and this one is exceptional. I have DX200 Ibasso, DP-X1 Onyko, A&amp;K 100ii.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love It!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I originally owned the X5mk2, the upgraded to the X5mk3 when it came out, and I have really enjoyed it. Knowing this was the new top of the line from Fiio, and after watching several reviews on Youtube from &ldquo;Bad Guy Good Audio Reviews&rdquo;, I decided to go for it and purchase the X7 Mark II. I will agree with the reviews and say it definitely has a better top end than the X5mk3, and I&rsquo;m only listening single ended currently, can&rsquo;t wait to hear what balanced sounds like. I&rsquo;m in the process of buying some balanced cables for my Optoma Nuforce HEM8&rsquo;s.To me, the $250 difference between the X5mk3 and the X7mk2 is well worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fiio-x7-mk-ii-one-great-step">FiiO X7 mk II - One great step</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FiiO X7 Mark II is a fantastic DAP! Very easy to operate with just the right controls, great build quality and plenty of storage for your music on the go. Android system makes it very versatile, either for music streaming services or other apps the user might want to install to take full potential of the platform. The modular amp system is another major benefict, not exclusive from X7 mk II but very well implemented and with a proven value. Beeing on the GO with local music or streaming, on a desk as a USB DAC or connected to the K5 dock, X7 mk II is a fantastic choice with a great value for all that offers.But for me what makes this a killer DAP is its sound quality, clarity and dynamics - The wide, 3D soudstage, everything so defined and on its own place - this deserves definitively a good in ear monitor or headphone to take full advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="coming-from-x5iii-targeting-balanced-out">Coming from X5III, targeting balanced out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upgraded from X5III, and the difference is great. I had the red version since it came out and decided that I want better Balanced Out performance. For the X5III, Balanced output was just an afterthought, it was underpowered and had high noise floor, bloomy bass and generally not very pleasurable to listen to. But with the AM3a included in this package, the sound is MUCH better with lower noise floor and improves upon the x5III in every aspect. With Balanced output, there is a 9db increase in separation and the soundstage is much larger. Usually the amp decides how much power it will drive into the Balanced Out and often for an amp module with both LO and BO one is always more powerful than the other. In this case with the AM3a the BO is more powerful of the two. Side note, it takes twice as power to drive the BO because it is 2 separate channels with separate ground, so it makes it just that much more complicated to do.VS the X5III, there is now dualband wifi for better HIRES streaming, the 2 slots of SD cards has faster transfer speed, the internal memory has upgraded to 64GB and that will hold maybe 15 DSD albums finally (lol). But the best and most important difference is that it&rsquo;s SO MUCH FASTER. I turned off every single app on the x5 and it still stutters. I couldn&rsquo;t even use some of the more popular apps because of how slow it got. With 2GBs of RAM on the X7II, now it&rsquo;s faster and more fluid, easier for me to use because it can take whatever I throw at it now. You can even ROOT it to install Greenify and make your experience better. The screen of the X7II is noticeably better as well, more even and better viewing angles, no more light bleed and hot spots and colors looks much better as well.The DAC chip has been upgraded, and with Neutron running 64bit processing and Dithering on using BAL out, it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve heard from any Fiio device. It&rsquo;s very evident Fiio has decided to keep the best for the flagship device, that way they won&rsquo;t cannibalize their own sales. I have converted all my headphone cables to balanced and I&rsquo;m really glad I did. I current have HD650, Xba-z5, ATH-ESW990 and few other pairs that all benefited from going to high powered Balanced.</p>
