The fixed-position brackets sit just 1.84 inches from the wall to complement the sleek, thin look of flat-panel TVs.

<h5 id="solid-mount-for-the-price-some-people-may-prefer-more-adjustable-model">Solid mount for the price - some people may prefer more adjustable model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super happy with this TV mount. We got a 60&rdquo; LG and didn&rsquo;t want to deal with mounting it ourselves so we also got Installation through Amazon. The guys that came out were great and had no problem with this mount. The only thing they pointed out to me was that with large rooms, a mount that tilts may actually be better because you may need to tilt it downward slightly to compensate for the fact that the people sitting on the couch are lower than the TV and the viewing experience may be better if the TV is angled slightly downward. We haven&rsquo;t had any problems seeing the TV, but I can see this might be an important point for others. Our couch is also kind of high so if your living room seating is very low you may want to consider the model that tilts.Great deal - it&rsquo;s solid and my TV hasn&rsquo;t come crashing to the ground yet so I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

<h5 id="check-bolt-lengths-before-proceeding-could-leave-you-with-your-pants-around-you-ankles">Check bolt lengths before proceeding, could leave you with your pants around you ankles!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The large bolts are way too short for Samsung Curved screens to use on the bottom holes of the curved screen tvs. They need to be about 4-6mm longer at least. Also there are not enough washers in this kit to make up the length difference on other tvs. You will find yourself needing a few washers or small spacers to make up length on most other 50&rdquo;+ Samsungs (and other tvs probably as well). If Sanus wasn&rsquo;t so cheap with their included bolts/washers, this would be a decent kit. At least when I buy Peerless mounts I know they come with so much extra hardware for the mount that they will fit pretty much any tv and then some (we used the extra bolts from (1) Peerless 20-40&rdquo; mount kit to complete (2) of these kits on two 65&rdquo; curved samsung tvs).*LACK OF PROPER OR EXTRA BOLT LENGTHS &amp; WASHERS**DO NOTE THIS MOUNT WILL NOT LOCK THE TV FROM SLIDING LEFT OR RIGHT, TV CAN BE SLID EACH WAY WITH EASE WHICHCOULD CAUSE DAMAGE IN THE FUTURE!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-tvs-with-lower-location-mount-holes">Perfect for TVs with lower location mount holes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great solid mount, only thing missing is spacers of varying sizes (the single set I got in the package were about <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo;, I needed only about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; in my scenario so I pirated some spare <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; spacers from other mounts - otherwise my cords were fitting too tightly against my TV). Honestly I&rsquo;m not understanding the near-flush obsession folks have with TVs, they are harder to put in and leave little room for cables (I might be an odd ball though because I use HDMI and USB extenders behind my TVs with centralized wiring).I will say after obsessing on which mount to buy for my Sony TV (xbr75x850d), I&rsquo;m glad I got this one. The mount holes are lower on these TVs rather than centered which allowed me to place this mount just below where the existing power and a/v connectors were. I imagine as TVs keep getting thinner, more TVs may come like this in the future where power and other A/V connections are towards the bottom.I hope more mount vendors provide spacers of varying size&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="basic-but-very-solid-and-easy-to-install">Basic but very solid, and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do tv installations for living as part of my job of custom electronics integration.Was looking for basic mount for 70&rdquo; Vizio TV for my customer.This mount is solid and very easy to install as, obviously, all Sanus products.TV extends from the wall for about an inch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="make-sure-your-cable-configuration-is-set-before-putting-it-on-the-mount-it-s-not-changing-after-that">Make sure your cable configuration is set before putting it on the mount. It&rsquo;s not changing after that.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very sturdy, easy to install, lots of room for lateral movement to adjust for studs not perfectly in the center of your viewing area. The only problem I had with it is it&rsquo;s fairly tricky to maneuver two people to pull the release cables and unhook the TV. My TV is brand new but still relatively heavy so perhaps it was a bad grip or just plain lack of strength but it took a few tries to get on and off to do cable adjustments. I see that some other Sanus models have a feature that let&rsquo;s you lock the bottom of the set at an angle, away from the wall, so you have a few inches to reach in and plug in wires. Wish I had known before I bought this one. Bottom line - get all your cables exactly how you want them prior to putting it on this mount!</p>

<h5 id="well-built-well-finished-good-quality-hardware-solid-smooth-safety-latches">Well-built. Well-finished. Good quality hardware. Solid, smooth safety latches.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good product. I&rsquo;ve installed several Samsung TVs using this wall mount and have been happy every time. My only reason for not giving the fifth star is that this hardware set did not include a pairing of screws and spacers that worked with the Samsung 40&rdquo; TV (UN6500-). Fortunately, I had parts left over from a previous installation that did have the proper sized screws/spacers, so I wasn&rsquo;t stymied. Quite honestly, had I been forced to stop work, drive to the hardware store and suss out the proper hardware, I&rsquo;d have dropped it to only 2 stars. I understand though that TV manufacturers are continually changing their specs, making it hard for 3rd-party companies to keep up.</p>

<h5 id="this-mount-works-great-in-my-living-room">This mount works great in my living room</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount works great in my living room. Instructions are straight forward, mounting is straight forward, was even able to mount my 65 in Sony by myself. The only suggestion, at least for sony customers, is make sure to attach all HDMIs that will be needed as it is a bit cumbersome to connect after the tv is mounted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mount">Great mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for my 60&rdquo; Sharp led TV. It&rsquo;s really low profile so I had to use some spacers to allow clearance for cable connections.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-install">easy to install</h5>

<p>Arrived swiftly, easy to install, works well for our 80&rdquo; TV screen.</p>

<h5 id="no-fit">No fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t fit for me&hellip; measures were correct, but the frame wasn&rsquo;t straight, haven&rsquo;t returned it, too much hassle :-(</p>

<h5 id="wish-it-was-a-little-wider-to-allow-for-a">Wish it was a little wider to allow for a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wish it was a little wider to allow for a bit more slide, but it was simple to install and is holding my 115lb 75&rdquo; TV without any issues. Very close to the wall as well!</p>

<h5 id="outstanding-customer-service-from-sanus">Outstanding customer service from Sanus</h5>

<p>This wall mount is very straightforward and simple to install. Unfortunately one of the brackets was defective so I called Sanus for help.</p>

<h5 id="recessed-cable-box-needed">Recessed cable box needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is very slim which makes it difficult to insert electrical &amp; Ethernet cables. It is highly recommended that a recessed cable box be used with this mount.</p>
