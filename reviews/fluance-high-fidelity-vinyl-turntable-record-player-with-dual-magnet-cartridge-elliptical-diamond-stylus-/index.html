<blockquote>
<p>This and the walnut finish RT-81 may just be among the best values in a turntable on the market today. Let me go off-topic slightly, then I&rsquo;ll get back to the turntable itself. I am very much NOT a newbie to vinyl. I was buying component turntables back in the 1970&rsquo;s when those vintage turntables were new - so when I caught wind of these turntables as a Kickstarter project, I jumped on it as an earlybird as I really got a good feel for what I saw. Well I now have taken delivery and am very pleased with what I have. Let&rsquo;s get into the turntable&hellip;.Built quality as well as fit/finish is very, very good. I went with the polished ebony RT-80 as I had every intention to upgrade the cartridge (one difference between this as the RT-81), I was pleased with the felt platter mat and I was <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> split on the walnut over solid base / plinth vs. piano finish over a hollow plinth. Both have the same arm, the same DC servo motor with electronic speed selection (vs. changing the belt position) and have a built in preamplifier that can be defeated. The platter is aluminum with a black finish, which matches the metal arm. All rests on compliant feet. The finish is truly beautiful!Setup was quick and easy, and I had the unit playing in a matter of minutes out of the box. Performance in every way is quite good by audiophile standards - this feels like a 1970&rsquo;s turntable. Speed is dead-on with no detectable flutter and I heard no rumble at reasonable volume levels - and I was actually surprised at how good the base level Audio Technica AT91 sounds when in a good arm as it had no tracking issues at 2 grams and is quite forgiving of worn recordings that my other turntables honestly are not forgiving of. Sound is dynamic with a crisp treble and punchy bass - don&rsquo;t dismiss this cartridge, especially if you don&rsquo;t mind having a second high-end cartridge for those mint albums (which we often did &ldquo;back in the day&rdquo;.Only issues were a minor feedback issue that I suspect the slightly heavier RT-81 with it&rsquo;s solid base might be more forgiving of, and I found that the auto stop takes several revolutions before stopping the motor. This turns out to be normal. A note that the phono preamplifier turns on when you select the speed - platter rotation is activated when you move the arm off the rest just as most turntables were &ldquo;back in the day&rdquo;.Overall I am very pleased, glad I backed this project, and it&rsquo;s good to see a quality turntable that is a real audiophile product and not a DJ wannabee at a very good price. Outside of the walnut RT-81, the only real competitor would be the base level U-Turn Orbit at this price point. Everything else is either plastic or at a higher price point with very little added performance.</p>

<h5 id="a-lot-of-bang-for-your-buck-but-has-one-flaw">A lot of bang for your buck, but has one flaw&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will preface by saying that for the price point you are receiving a lot of bang for your buck. The tonearm is superb, the Audio Technica cartridge is clear and mostly uncolored, the rubber mat is high quality, the base is solid and heavy (this is a really good thing), the built-in preamp is enough to get you started and enjoying your favorite records (although, I do recommend getting an upgraded external phono preamp as your next upgrade), and the turntable just overall looks fantastic. I love it!However, I did find that the turntable speed is not quite as stable as I would like to see it. I allowed it to &ldquo;burn-in&rdquo; for 48 hours running on the 33RPM setting and played a record, halfway through the sound became distorted so I went to check the RPM and found that it was spinning at ~29.8RPM. So I lifted the turntable and adjusted the speed using the trimpots on the bottom, but I just cannot get it to spin at a constant or acceptable mean average of 33.3RPM. I just measured it again as I am posting this review and it fluctuates between ~32.8-33.5RPM. Fluance does provide two trimpots at the bottom of the turntable to adjust the speed but it requires me to unplug everything and move it somewhere high enough for me to adjust, so far I had to do this four times. The speed discrepancy does not bother my wife, but I can tell clearly when listening to piano or orchestral pieces that the pitch and speed of the notes is fluctuating so it becomes a small distraction during focused listening sessions. I will say that I am using an iOS application to measure RPM and do not have another turntable around to test it&rsquo;s accuracy, but from other online reviews I saw this seems to be an issue that is not isolated to me.After saying that, would I recommend this turntable? Absolutely. I checked the competition and did not find the same amount of value I found with this. From the cartridge, build materials, helpful Youtube tutorials (check out their channel), and aesthetics I don&rsquo;t think you will find a better bang for your buck for the $200-$300 price range. While the RPM issue is distracting when listening to delicate pieces you do not notice it as much when listening to more modern &ldquo;louder&rdquo; records.PROs:- Looks great- Built solid- Quality tonearm and cartridge- Good sounding preampCONs:- Rotation speed not as accurate as I would like it to be- The adjustment for the RPM is located on the bottom and is hard to reach</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to love this record player. It had a great price. It had a solid, minimalist look, a counter-weighted tonearm, two speeds, plus auto-off! It was too good to be true.The motor has a very noticeable amount of wow and flutter. My 9 and 6 year old kids could hear it on their records. What a let down! Everything else about this player is bang for the buck. But if an elementary school kid can hear the pitch getting sloppy, what&rsquo;s the point?Ironically, before this fault showed itself, I actually replied to a question on the listing page where someone asked why it didn&rsquo;t have pitch adjust. I said because with a decent motor, only DJs should need pitch control!I returned it to Amazon, admittedly, and didn&rsquo;t give Fluance a chance to make it right. Perhaps I just got a dud. If you buy it, I hope you get a good one!UPDATE <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2017</sub>: I have added a star to this review because Fluance went an extra mile with their customer service after reading this review. I was contacted 3 times to ask if I was willing to work with Fluance to remedy the faulty turntable, one of which was after it was already back in Amazon&rsquo;s possession. It was enough effort to make me regret returning it so hastily. If their fixes are as good as their outreach, I believe I would have a well-running Fluance turntable by now. Circumstances what they are, do make that an assumption, though.</p>
