<p>Product Description
The VIOlight Toothbrush Sanitizer and Storage System, designed by Philippe Starck, uses safe, clean ultraviolet light to kill up to 99.9% of the germs it comes into contact with on your toothbrush. The unit holds up to four toothbrushes, including children&rsquo;s and electric toothbrush heads. Using Violight requires no extra steps; simply brush, store, and sanitize! Manufacturer contact information: 888 882 2367</p>

<p>Amazon.com
No matter how often you scrub and clean, microscopic critters will thrive in the warm, moist environment of the average bathroom. In fact, a single toothbrush can harbor millions of microorganisms&ndash; millions! That means it&rsquo;s a good idea to sanitize something you stick in your mouth everyday, thus reducing your chances of infection.</p>

<p>The Violight&rsquo;s nifty design, mixed with the peace of mind it offers, make it a great addition to the bathroom.
Fortunately, the Violight VS100 Toothbrush Sanitizer offers an effective way to protect yourself and your family in a quick and easy-to-use package. Toothbrushers everywhere will like this trusty little gadget.
When we removed the sanitizer from its box, we were impressed with the stylish design. It is simple and sleek, with a silver matte-finished body and an opaque, light blue cap. While it looks like an ordinary toothbrush holder, it&rsquo;s actually furnished with a powerful UV germicidal light bulb. After plugging in the sanitizer, we inserted our brushes and pressed the &ldquo;VIO&rdquo; button on the front of the device. The bulb switched on, producing a soothing blue glow. In only ten short minutes the bulb switched off and our toothbrushes were left clean and safely stored in the sanitizer.</p>

<p>According to independent studies, the Violight is able to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria living on your toothbrush. Plus, it&rsquo;s ultra-safe to use, and you don&rsquo;t have to mess with dangerous, hot steam or boiling water. We used the Violight over and over again for a week, sanitizing our brushes after each use&ndash; up three times a day. The device consistently did its job and, according to the manufacturer, one bulb should last over 2000 hours. This means you could clean four brushes over two hundred times.</p>

<p>The Violight has some other practical features that deserve mention. First, the bulb is very easy to access and replace when the time comes. Also, the cap snaps in and out of place with ease, revealing a removable drip tray. Although the UV light eliminates the germs and bacteria, it was still nice to have access to the drip tray to clean toothpaste residue and water marks. The Violight also features a non-slip base so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it slipping off a wet countertop.
The real benefit of the Violight, though, is that it provides peace of mind and good protection from all kinds of nastiness that might be lurking on your trusty bristles. Although toothbrushes don&rsquo;t feel any different after being sanitized by the Violight, it&rsquo;s nice to know that your brushes are clean and germ free. After finding out that the Centers for Disease Control has even stated that toothbrushes can be a significant source of &ldquo;potentially pathogenic organisms,&rdquo; we were glad the Violight was around. We recommend it for those who want the ultimate in brushing safety. Without a doubt, the Violight sanitizer puts the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; back in oral hygiene.

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second Violife Toothbrush Sanitizer. My first unit lasted me quite a few years and I got my moneys&rsquo; worth out of it. I made my initial purchase after seeing the item on the Rachel Ray show. They actually had toothbrushes sent to a lab to be analyzed. The toothbrush that was kept in a cup on the bathroom counter was full of germs and bacteria. The toothbrush that was in the Violife was completely free of germs and bacteria. I truly believe that since using the sanitizer my family has had less colds. I also like it because I keep my toothbrushes on my bathroom counter also and with them encased in the Violife, I know they are safe from any nasty germs thrown up into the air when the toilet is flushed. I would have given this 5 stars but for the fact that my last Violife also could be run on batteries and I preferred that to having to plug in. I have to address the reviews that mention mold in the unit. If you read the directions it tells you to get any excess water off of the toothbrush before putting it into the unit. As with anything you have to clean it out. Once a week I remove the cup and clean it with a watered down bleach solution. Its a simple trade-off for the peace of mind.</p>

<h5 id="good-unless-you-use-an-electric-toothbrush">Good unless you use an electric toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We just bought our 2nd VIOlight tootbrush sanitizer, after the &ldquo;on&rdquo; button on the previous one disintegrated. Up to this point, we thought it worked very well. But if you use an electric toothbrush, you might want to avoid this sanitizer, as it&rsquo;s now sent with 2 different sizes of &ldquo;VIOpegs&rdquo; (to hold the shorter brushes up) &ndash; only 2 of each size. The 2 longer pegs seem to work only with very short, round brushes. Our Sonicare heads don&rsquo;t work with the 2 longer pegs, but when we called the company, they said that was it &ndash; they wouldn&rsquo;t/couldn&rsquo;t send 2 more of the shorter pegs. So we&rsquo;re left to use no pegs for at least 2 of our heads, but then the toothbrush heads fall so far into the top of the sanitizer that they&rsquo;re hard to get out. All in all, this model doesn&rsquo;t work well for electric toothbrush heads such as Sonicare.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="inferior-item-burns-brushes-collects-water">Inferior Item &ndash; Burns Brushes &amp; Collects Water</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I replaced my Violight half a dozen times over the past few years. It was hard to fit one of my toothbrushes in the hole, and I was always cleaning the unit. Sometimes I&rsquo;d get a burned smell from my toothbrush, and when I opened the Violight there would be black charring on the plastic inside. I also noticed that, despite us shaking off our toothbrushes religiously, water was pooling (and smelled foul) in the bottom of the unit. One reviewer mentioned she was getting sick from having her toothbrush upside down in water, and I believe her.I looked around and settled on the Multiple Toothbrush &amp; Razor UV Sanitizer Wall Mounted, here at Amazon. It wall mounts with either sticky tape or screws (they give you both), has a sidecar for toothpaste (we didn&rsquo;t attach ours), the toothbrushes easily hang head up so they stay dry, there&rsquo;s room for a razor (I don&rsquo;t use that, either), and the whole thing looks nice (just a rectangular blue on the wall). I wish I&rsquo;d know about this product before I ever paid more money and bought my first Violight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="when-all-else-fails-use-a-gounded-outlet-and-press-reset">When all else fails use a gounded outlet and press reset.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although some reviews gave me reservation to buy this product, I felt the benefits for this unique item was worth the gamble. I ordered the item and it arrived quickly, I set it up, plugged it in and it worked! Then I unplugged it went through my day and then when it was next plugged in nothing happened. Since we were in a hurry I requested a return label from Amazon which was received efficiently. I looked for something comparable but it wasn;&rsquo;t there.After many hours I returned and realized that I really wanted this item to work. So since it was going to be returned anyway, I took it to a &ldquo;grounded&rdquo; outlet in the &ldquo;other bathroom&rdquo; and pressed &ldquo;Reset&rdquo;. The Sanitizer jumped to life. I guess it had just gotten overloaded or underloaded and couldn&rsquo;t work without receiving an extra jolt. Too bad there isn&rsquo;t a reset button on the unit and probably no one would every have a problem, except the product would probably become more expensive. I&rsquo;m happy with it now and hope not to experience any future problems. My mouth and health look forward to the anticipated benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="money-wasted">Money Wasted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The toothbrush sanitizer started out beautifully then worked well for about a week. After that I noticed that I&rsquo;d come home at the end of the day and it was still running and the toothbrushes would be hot and smelled like they were burning. That happened for a few days and then the product just died.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-awesome-product-and-i-highly-recommend-it">This is a awesome product and I highly recommend it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually leave feedbacks, but I felt this needed one. I had one for over 5 years with no problems at all. The only reason why I bought a new one was bulb needed to be replaced (even if bulb still glows need to change at least in a year). The light by itself was 11.95 and cup to put toothbrushes in was 9.95 plus shipping and handling. Only place I could find replacements were Violight. Because we wanted to get new cups and light, we decided to get a new one and have warranty again. I have had no problem with button as others have stated. Since I have got my new one, I haven&rsquo;t got sick so I feel it really does help kill germs. This is a awesome product and I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="how-do-you-know-it-s-working">How do you know it&rsquo;s working?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure how to test that its actually sanitizing. Make sure you frequently clean out the inner tray real good or it is subject to gunk build up. Bulbs are not easily replaceable. Not something I would purchase again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="transformer-constant-hum">Transformer constant hum</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well, however the transformer constantly hums, even when the unit is not runner not. So I have to unplug it when not in use.</p>
