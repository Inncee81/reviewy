<h5 id="this-tripod-is-awesome-its-portable">This tripod is awesome, its portable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few tripod and so far this is my favorite. It actually exceeded my expectation, this is a well made and it&rsquo;s a good quality product for a very affordable price.I just got surprised, how lightweight it, very small and it dosen&rsquo;t take much space and very stable too&hellip;- Hexagonal center column really keeps the center post steady regardless of if it&rsquo;s raised or not.- All three legs are padded (you&rsquo;d be surprised how many higher brands aren&rsquo;t)- The pan head is very fluid/smooth and bubble levels are everywhere.- The video/still panning dial/lock is also a very nice feature, allowing you to really lock down the vertical tilt while still being able to smoothly pan horizontally when shooting video. This virtually eliminates the problem of nose droop from the weight of the camera lens, which was a problem with ALL of the other tripods I tried. And then when you need to you can just flip the knob and be able to lock down both pan and tilt securely (like for still photography).- The quick-release plate is hand-tightened (requires no tools) and the entire tripod head is easily removable.Lastly it is very easy to carry everywhere cuz it has a carrying bag. Love it! I&rsquo;m very pleased with my purchased.If they provided a phone holder, it would been a good addition too, but never mind, i had one already and used it as most of my photos are with mobile&hellip; :)</p>

<h5 id="light-and-travel-friendly">Light and travel friendly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a tripod quickly because of an upcoming event and then my trip in a few weeks so decided to get this. The tripod is perfect for my needs as it can be adjusted for height, is relatively light weight and very easy to use. My canon fit on top easily and it was easy to operate. It will also be great for videography at parties for me. Comes with a bag to carry along, overall good quality, will recommend.</p>

<h5 id="great-tripod-sturdy-well-built-high-quality">Great tripod - sturdy, well built, high quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; tripod I&rsquo;ve ever purchased to use with my Nikon d5500 - and I am thoroughly impressed.This tripod is high quality, sturdy, and well built. When the legs and center column are fully extended, the top of the tripod hits me at about chin height (I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;4&rdquo;). There are lots of knobs and different, small adjustable mechanisms that make it slightly less user friendly than my old tripod - but exponentially more accurate and precise. I bought this in yellow and I love the color.I would recommend this to a friend. Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="good-looking-lightweight">Good Looking &amp; Lightweight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My passion and hobby are moments in photos, so much can be said in a picture. Found this great tripod to replace our old one of 30 years. I am using my Nikon D3000 on this tripod.As soon I received it I found it to be just as described in the item description. It is good looking, lightweight, easy set up and comes in a carry bag.Looking forward to using it at the American Red Cross Heroes event I am shooting this coming March 1, 2017.I have tried to add photo but it won&rsquo;t let me.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-sturdy-durable">it&rsquo;s sturdy, durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tripod was well packed and delivered intact, it&rsquo;s thoughtful and convenient that it came with a carrying bag. It&rsquo;s a very professional tripod, it&rsquo;s sturdy, durable, light weigh. Everything shows the good quality of material and the workmanship. The smart design makes it very flexible, the legs has 3 flip locks that can extend the legs to its full length, they&rsquo;ve gotten a pad under each leg, and the legs angle can be adjustable to wide open, the tripod can be down all the way till very low. The top crane can be raised up which extend the tripod highest till around 55&rdquo;. It holds the camera stable in almost any position I want to use, the quick release plate is useful to stay the camera in place quickly. and I use it in fields to hold the camera,VC. And I found its another usage that is to hold my projector at home, this way I can easily put the projector anywhere I want to :). It&rsquo;s so far so good and I&rsquo;m satisfied with the purchase.</p>

<h5 id="light-weight-but-very-sturdy-tripod-it-feels-as-sturdy-and-stable-as-my-trekking-poles">Light weight but very sturdy tripod. It feels as sturdy and stable as my trekking poles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great product. I ordered this tripod to replace old one. My old tripod is not working well after being used for many years. This new tripod is excellent from design to material selection. I used it in a field trip recently. It&rsquo;s very sturdy and its legs never slid after being locked, which is most important when we mount a valuable and heavy DSLR camera on top of it :-) This made-in-China product has similar quality of most US made products. Will recommend.The features I like most are:- Light weight but very sturdy. It feels as sturdy and stable as my trekking poles- Larger lever-lock handles than most other tripods, which allows me to lock/unlock legs quickly and comfortably- Foam on top of each leg. This is very helpful to hold the tripod comfortably in cold weather</p>

<h5 id="best-tripod-ive-ever-owned">Best tripod Ive ever owned</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, this tripod was bought in replacement of my flimsy cheap sheet metal tripod&hellip; That old one has to retire because it almost fall apart (I need my camera to be safe from ground) when I shot outside. Now this max 55inch tall tripod grants me not only the stability, but also the energetic looking. The color is unique, and I totally fell for that. It is heavier than my old pal, but it comes with a carrying bag, and the grip on the legs made it easier to set up.While it has all the goods, I also have a few recommendations to point out: a horizontal level indicator can be integrated with the holder; the feet are currently plastic with adjustable angle, but I do love to see the old fashioned metal poles that stick into softer ground. Can&rsquo;t ask for more. This is an awesome tripod for the money:)</p>
