<h5 id="keeps-your-food-fresh-longer">Keeps your food fresh longer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this on a crowd funding site because I was so impressed with the product. When I received the product I could not have been happier.I particularly like this for fresh fruits and vegetables, they stay fresh so much longer. The vacuum bags work great for freezing and I have now gotten into Sous Vie cooking using the Vacuvita bags to marinate and cook meats. I use all the products regularly.The system is really easy to use. Home base just plugs in and is immediately working. To use the additional containers is also simple, you just attach a simple connection from the home base to the container and in 90 seconds the vacuum is complete. You can then open these contains remove food and activate the vacuum again to keep the remaining food fresh. I have found the bags slightly more of a challenge but 99% of the time they worked as easily. Key seems to be to get the closure correct and not to over-fill. Another small but great thing is they have a small window so you can see what you put in the container. I will admit I have not used the app yet.The only thing I would warn people of is that the home base is a large piece so you have to have counter space - that said it is great looking. I have the white set and it looks fine on my counter. I am happy with this purchase.</p>

<p>I purchased this product thru the crowdfunding and waited over 2 years for it. May I just say, SO WORTH THE WAIT!This will type of product become a standard addition to every household within a few years. No joke, I truly believe this statement.PROS:1) Easy to use. Set up is plug and go. The Vacuvita will have to be plugged in to open and will take a minute or so to remove the air if the base is empty, a little less if breads are inside.2) Large space inside the Vacuvita base for your product. It is approximately 16L x 7 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> W x 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> D. Note: you will loose 1 inch for the light housing in the center of the unit. (see cons for outside dimensions)3) Keeps everything so fresh! I have buns and bread from December 2016, it is Feb 2017! And no it is not a science experiment. We don&rsquo;t eat much bread and always ended up feeding the birds. Sorry, Birdies!4) The containers come in 3 sizes - 1 gallon, half gallon and quarter gallon. Fruit and veggies can last a month. The tube is a bit tricky but after a few times you will have no problem.5) Vacuvita products are BPA and BPS free.6) Vacuvita comes in 5 colors. White, Black, Blue, Green and Orange. Containers are in same colors. Clear is not an option as it will allow the light to damage the food inside.7) Lighted open button - It is very touch sensitive. Works as a nightlight. Also is a warning indicator if something is wrong.8) Manual is both in paper copy and online, for when you loose the paper copy.9) Vacuvita has an app that allows you to log what you are sealing in the containers, bags or putting in the base. No more purchasing and discovering you already had that item in the freezer! Also, the app will notify you when the item is getting close to the expiration date.10) Vacuvita containers can be used to marinate your product within minutes.&rsquo; By removing the air from the container, the pores of the meat will open up and the marinade will be absorbed much faster.&rsquo; Yes, it really work!CONS:1) Vacuvita is expensive. That said, figure out how much bread, fruit, veggies and other frozen products you have wasted in the last 2 months. Seriously, I recommend you begin a list, wait 2 months and think the purchase over and be honest with yourself on the waste. After 2 months or less, then you can decide if you don&rsquo;t think you can afford it.2) The pump is a noisy. It will also randomly go off when you are not expecting it to. Nope, it is not possessed. The Vacuvita will remove extra air when it detects it inside the base.3)Large sized base. I was surprised at the size of this thing. Outside base sized at 18 L X 11 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> W X 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> D. (see pros for inside dimensions)4) Bags - The site states that the bags are one time use, but I am not convinced on that point. I have not had a chance to use the vacuum bags yet so I cannot say anything about them. But they do come in gallon and 2 quart sized bags.5) If the Vacuvita is unplugged, it will not open. Now, this is a pro and a con. The only time I can see this causing an issue is if the power went out.Bottom Line : I am glad I purchased this. I Would purchase Vacuvita again. I will recommend this to friends (I already have, actually).Hope this helped you make a decision on this purchase. Have an awesome day!</p>

<p>I had multiple issues with this unit and this was the second one I tried out before returning it as well after about 3 weeks of almost daily use. The hose attachment is kind of stiff which I did like at first because it was braided and would be more durable, but the accessory attachment when sealing bags required it to be flat on the vacu-bags when sealing, so after a couple bags were sealed it would come loose and you&rsquo;re wondering why it is taking so long to seal and realize it is not completely connected. If the hose was at least 6&rdquo; longer and had some kind of snap on clasp, or attached from the top and not put strain on the side connection, I think it would work out. Sealing a bag was a gamble sometimes. It would take a try or two and then it would work for like 3 bags in a row and then it would stop working. The vacu-containers worked great, when they worked. I had so many problems with these containers. Some would never hold a seal and the device would just time out after like a minute of trying vacuum seal or some would seal and then a day or two later when I would open them up there would be no hissing from the top valve, and my food just ended up being preserved by a regular container. This happened to ALL 3 sizes of containers from 2 different units. At first i thought i might have been a faulty batch, but when my second unit had a container issue and they offered to replace it after I ran some tests, and during that time another unit lost its ability to hold a seal, I sent it back along with the other one to Vacuvita, and promptly returned my Vacuvita system and remaining containers back to Amazon. Also, I felt that the base unit did a pretty bad job with breads and other dry goods. I placed a loaf of Ezekiel bread in the base unit with the bread bag still on the loaf (per Vacuvita&rsquo;s recommendation) and the loaf went moldy after 2 days! It was never even opened! I think the base itself did the worst job out of all the containers. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because how easy it was seal using the bags (when you got the accessory on right and checked it each time and didn&rsquo;t pull too hard on the hose) , and the accessory was pretty good at not letting moisture pass, and it was easy to clean. In closing, I think Vacuvita needs to get the seals on their containers figured out and extend the hose and fix the attachment. I really wanted this to work out but I felt it was working properly only half the time and then a container would crap out. This unit also has serious limitation in regards to how you use the home base unit which are not clearly noted in the instructions or their site. Here&rsquo;s a response in regards to bread going moldy in a couple days from a one of their many listings &ldquo;I am very sorry to hear that you decided to return your Vacuvita system. Storing crisp, dry foods and humid products in the same Home Base or container causes the dry products to go soggy and the moist products to turn dry. Fresh baked bread is actually both: a crispy crust, and a soft, moist interior. We recommend that you leave the bread in a paper or plastic bag inside the Home Base. That way it is protected from the outside air and atmosphere, but does not suffer from the moisture migration. The quality of your bread and ingredients also strongly affect the storage time. Some store bought breads have preservatives in them, so they are likely to keep longer than home baked or artisanal breads that don’t. Because the air is sucked out of the Home Base, bags or containers, the relative humidity inside is much higher. This means that sometimes when you open the Home Base, it feels warm in there, while it is actually not warmer, but more humid than the room the Home Base is standing in. Some baked goods are very sensitive to high humidity and might even spoil faster. Keeping the bread inside a bag will resolve that as well. Placing the Home Base in stand-by mode will also assist in preserving baked goods in the Home Base longer. Thank you very much.&rdquo; My bread was kept in it&rsquo;s original bag and wasn&rsquo;t opened and it still went moldy in a couple days with no other foods inside the base but the bread.</p>
