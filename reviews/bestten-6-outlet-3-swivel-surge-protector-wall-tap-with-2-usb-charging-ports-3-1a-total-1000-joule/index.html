<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="nice-but-could-be-more-stable">Nice but could be more stable..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like having the sockets on the side so the plugs don&rsquo;t stick out. The option of having one side swivel is also a nice feature if you have something a little larger to plug in that won&rsquo;t rest against the wall although that might be an issue it that cord was heavy. I especially like the 2 USB ports, which is one of the reasons I purchased this item. The only negative thing I have to say is that it could be more stable in the outlet. You do have to hold on to it if you need to unplug anything including something plugged into the USP port. I don&rsquo;t think it would be a good product if the outlets were on the front as the weight of the cords plugged into it would pull it out of the outlet. It would be nice if the unit could be made with a hole and a long screw to actually attach it to the outlet. That would stabilize it. For me it isn&rsquo;t much of an issue because I never or very rarely unplug anything from it as it is behind one of my end tables..</p>

<h5 id="good-customer-service-good-price-very-useful-product-first-one-had-issues-but-bestten-made-it-right-and-the-rest-work-well">Good customer service, good price, very useful product - first one had issues but, Bestten made it right and the rest work well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>6/22/17 Update: Customer service replaced the defective unit with a new one and, yup, it works just peachy. I think that I got unlucky the first time around. Bought a few more today because - and seriously - who doesn&rsquo;t have a bazillion things that need more regular and USB outlets everywhere around their house! Besides the phones, computer peripherals, Kindles, Echos, speakers, jeez&hellip;even my cat&rsquo;s water fountain uses a USB charger. We have constant issues with power in the summer around the Phoenix area that cause little spikes and short micro-outages that screw with all the little USB things I use, so having a little extra surge protection is a nice perk.6/9/17 Follow Up: Bestten customer service reached out and offered a replacement - thanks guys! So, gotta upgrade my rating for a company that takes customer satisfaction seriously. Hopefully the new unit will work as advertised :-)6/6/17 Initial Review: Seems to have been put together funny - the swivel doesn&rsquo;t swivel (necessary to fit behind furniture in my case), parts don&rsquo;t quite match up. Makes me a little nervous about what&rsquo;s inside. Otherwise, the USB and outlets (on the non-swivel side) seem to work&hellip;if I didn&rsquo;t need the swivel to hold those pesky transformers I&rsquo;d probably live with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-and-quick-alternative-to-a-traditional-power-strip">Simple and quick alternative to a traditional power strip</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There were no UL markings anywhere in the box or product itself. However, the item does seem solid and well made. It solved our outlet need without having to get a power strip which would be in the floor with all the plugs or need to be secured to the wall. This was a much neater and simpler solution. And the USB ports are great as well. If they were on the same faces as the outlets, they&rsquo;d be perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-choice-for-surges-and-the-kitchen">Excellent choice for surges and the kitchen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is very good so far. I’m hoping it will last. The only thing is that in my outlet it had to go upside down because of the plastic stick in addition to the prongs that fit the holes of the outlet, so I put that way and works perfectly. Very convenient for charging phones. I have in my kitchen where I use for my fridge, my coffee grinder, milk frother, lamp and some lights I put up, plus my blender. It has the 3 prongs for the outlet on the opposite side shown and a stick that goes in hole of second outlet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-versatile-swivel-outlets">Very Versatile Swivel Outlets</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought 5 of these to go behind furniture because a lot of plugs are so big or deep that the furniture has to be inches from the wall instead of snugged up. I knew I had definite places for 3 of them (ordered 2 more on speculation), but we have managed to use all 5 instantly. They work great and really solve the sticks-out-too-far plug problem. I highly recommend!!!Be aware that the whole unit plugs into both the top and bottom of a 2-gang wall socket, but where you use up 2 outlets to plug this unit in, you gain 6 PLUS a place to plug in a recharger. Also, where you have side by side 2-gang outlets, it will cover all 4. Also, putting one of these behind a wall-hugging piece of furniture makes it pretty impossible to plug and unplug a recharging cord.We especially liked placement behind night stands where a 2-stack is taken up with clock and lamp, leaving no outlet for anything else. We have a bed firmness control that has to go somewhere as well as a land line phone, and before this unit, had to use an awkward power strip. Same problem on my desk where I have counted 6 different things that have to plug in. This unit eliminated the need for a power stip.My order arrived within 4 days and was well packaged. Very good service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-useful-and-thin">Very useful and thin</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husbands nightstand is very close to the wall (less than two inches) and when he had items plugged in, the bottom drawer wouldn&rsquo;t open. Between the outlet depth and the plug it stuck out too far. This solved that completely. He plugs the permanent things into the side part and temporary one he plugs into the front ones. Very useful. He&rsquo;s happy so I&rsquo;m happy. &ldquo;Happy husband, peaceful home.&rdquo; Right ladies?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-in-my-kitchen">Perfect in my kitchen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this swivel outlet. I put it in my small kitchen to plug in my 4 necessities items. Coffee maker, can opener, blender and charge cord for my iPad. The cords lay flat against the wall making more space on the kitchen counter. The USB plug in gives me a place in the kitchen to watch the iPad while I am cooking and cleaning in there.Very convenient and practical.Note: The back of the swivel outlet connects electrically to the lower position in the wall socket. There are plastic mounts the back of the swivel outlet that plug into the upper position of the wall socket for support only.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-cool-product-itself-is-fine-but-the-way-it">not cool. Product itself is fine but the way it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not hold tight in socket. Amazon reviews describe several different units, not cool. Product itself is fine but the way it affixes to socket is terrible</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-the-product-but-depending-on-what-you-have-plugged">I like the product but depending on what you have plugged &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the product but depending on what you have plugged in, can pull it from the wall especially if you have the rotating plugs facing straight out from the wall; other than&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works well in tight spaces. use it around my sound system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-i-like-the-swivel-option">But I like the swivel option</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Missing the screw in the middle of it to stay in place when you pull a plug from it. The whole thing comes off the wall. But I like the swivel option.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-home-office-and-guest-room">Great for the home office and guest room</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works magnificiantly. Great for the home office and guest room. Plug away your toys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what i needed works good and came in a timely manner</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect device for flattening out the cords. Fits nicely behind furniture.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fit">Great Fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely Great fit in my house this product solved several problems I was running into with newer technology plug ins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised-though-it-does-not-stay-plugged-into">Works as advertised though it does not stay plugged into &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised though it does not stay plugged into the wall socket well. I fixed this by using adhesive tabs and gluing to the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived quickly and works exactly as described and as I had hoped. We are all electronically connected these days, often with many devices in one location.</p>

<p>I absolutely love this item.</p>
