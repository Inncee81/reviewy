<h5 id="extended-edition-blu-ray">Extended Edition Blu-ray</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the EXTENDED EDITION Blu-ray. The five stars relate to the movie itself and the quality of this Blu-ray edition.I had purchased the original Blu-ray when it was released. I doubt I would have purchased this again for only ten additional minutes of content except for the Amazon credit I needed to burn. Of course this is a no brainer if you are upgrading to Blu-ray or haven&rsquo;t purchased yet. I was unable to find an explanation online as to the actual extra scene content, so I have provided a synopsis here.Spoilers Follow:Most of the additional screen time relates to Mark Watney on the planet. Otherwise, there is a scene between Vincent and Annie after his press conference where she is unhappy with his performance. There is also a scene where the NASA group are discussing what Mark wrote in response to finding out they hadn&rsquo;t told the crew he was alive. This was supposedly changed for the movie to get the PG-13 theatrical rating. There is also a little more of Rich Purnell.On Mars there are a number of scenes which just have a few seconds added on. This also relates to showing the lag in downtime with both Mark and NASA waiting for responses. There is a scene showing Commander Lewis letting Mark know they were coming for him. A couple of scenes where Mark decides to finish the work and experiments the crew were doing, and him doing that. A little additional time in the rover, and a section showing how he lived during the time it took him to get to the rocket.There is four minutes of deleted scenes on disk two.*Mark calculates rover time distances*Hermes crew discuss sleeping arrangements*Mark looks at Earth from Hermes with final VOA good movie and an excellent looking picture. One of the few lately where the CGI doesn&rsquo;t look overdone.</p>

<h5 id="the-martian-extended-edition-outstanding-feature-film-and-new-bonus-features-make-this-worthwhile">&ldquo;The Martian Extended Edition:&rdquo; outstanding feature film and new bonus features make this worthwhile.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Film director Ridley Scott is well known for releasing direct-to-disc “Extended Editions” or “Director’s Cuts” of selected movies, usually several months after the completion of their theatrical runs. His most notable Director’s Cuts, which are usually vastly superior to their shorter theatrical releases, include “Kingdom of Heaven,” “American Gangster,” “Gladiator,” and now “The Martian.”I’ve already reviewed the theatrical release version on Blu-ray disc (BD) of “The Martian” here at Amazon. I think it’s a nearly perfect blend of drama, high adventure, suspense, comedy, and realistically futuristic technology. Starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean, and based on Andy Weir’s novel of the same name, it tells the story of how an American astronaut, presumed killed in a violent sandstorm on Mars, is left behind to fight for his survival against incredibly long odds…“The Martian Extended Edition” is a 2-BD set, with one disc containing both the theatrical release and extended edition of Scott’s feature film, and the other containing a wide variety of excellent special features – most of which are brand new. The extended edition is 151 minutes long and adds about 10 minutes of footage to the theatrical release. Most of the extra footage shows astronaut Mark Watney’s heroic efforts to survive on Mars long enough for someone to come and rescue him. A few minutes are added to various scenes back on earth at Mission Control.I didn’t see any significant differences between the extended and theatrical versions of the film, so I’m a bit undecided as to whether or not my purchase of “The Martian Extended Edition” was worth the extra money I paid for it. However, if there were anything that does make my purchase worthwhile, it would have to be that supplemental “Special Features” disc included in this 2-BD set. I thought the bonus features were all very entertaining, interesting, and helpful in enhancing my enjoyment of the feature film. Highly recommended for both the feature film and the outstanding bonus features.</p>

<h5 id="stunning-in-true-4k">Stunning in true 4k</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My family watched the 4K Ultra-HD version of The Martian last night, and it was absolutely breathtaking. We had seen this movie in the theaters when it was initially released, and enjoyed it then. I purchased the 4k version primarily as a test-drive of a new home video setup that I recently established. I viewed this on a a 65&rdquo; LG OLED B-series television, connected to a Samsung UBD-K8500 true 4k player, and Sony DN1060 amplifier, powering 4 ceiling mounted speakers plus Polk center and sub-woofer (5.1) speakers. Honestly&ndash;the picture was so crystal clear that several times during the movie my wife thought it was in 3D (it was not). The scenery was really spectacular, and I was particularly struck by the (surprisingly few) outer space scenes, with the blackest of blacks contrasted against stars, spaceships, etc. This is NOT a movie that will showcase your surround sound very much, but there are occasional scenes where having 5.1 or better is nice.Now I do enjoy the experience of going to the theater, with their huge screens and superb audio. I&rsquo;m not keen on large or noisy crowds, but I will continue to go to the theaters occasionally, which is all our busy family schedule can ever accommodate. I&rsquo;ll even splurge on the crazy priced popcorn now and again too. But with the latest 4K media finally making its way to the market, I&rsquo;ll be equally happy to purchase the media for my personal library and pop my own corn at home!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic movie and FANTASTIC 4K transfer. Literally the clearist, crispest video I&rsquo;ve EVER watched on my television. The movie is phenomenal, passionate, and funny. Extremely beautiful film both in content and in visuals. Beautiful beautiful beautiful. If you&rsquo;re looking for a movie to show off your 4k tv this is probably a really good one to pick up (this makes Watchmen in 4k look like a dvd)</p>

<h5 id="another-great-film-from-ridley-scott">Another great film from Ridley Scott.</h5>

<p>Except for being fiction, it is much like Ron Howards Apollo 13 and of the same quality of script and production. A great movie.</p>

<p>The UHD is quite a step up if you have a TV that can take advantage of this. THe HDR makes colors just pop off the screen.</p>
