<h5 id="mafia-iii-spoiler-free-review-ps4">MAFIA III <strong><em>SPOILER FREE REVIEW</em></strong> PS4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>SPOILER FREE REVIEW</strong>Right off the bat, I&rsquo;d like to say this is a great game, but has it&rsquo;s faults. The story in this is really intriguing, I think the opening prologue is one the best openings I&rsquo;ve played in recent years. The way the story is set up is almost like a documentary and you&rsquo;re playing flashbacks, it&rsquo;s really unique, and the revenge plot I find a lot of fun, keeps me playing for me. However after you get through the prologue the game gets extremely repetitive.Basically the whole objective in the game is take over the districts from Marcano (The Don of the Marcano family) I believe there is about 7 to 8 districts. And then their is this mundane task of doing the same objective twice, which then opens up a mission to take out the main boss of that area, to control it for yourself. All of the missions are pretty much the same. Blow this up, kill this guy, steal this item in this building, kill mini boss, repeat. Then take out the boss of the area, control for yourself. Personally these main objectives don&rsquo;t bother me at all, because of the choices you make after you control a district. You have three underbosses, who help you throughout the game, each with their own special talents, that you&rsquo;ll receive and upgrade throughout the game to help you out. After a district is taken over, you then appoint an underboss to take control of it. Depending on the circumstances there may be consequences with your decision. An underboss may retaliate if they feel betrayed, or that they&rsquo;re not being taken care of. The side missions are nice, and completing them will help bring in money faster and/or build a better relationship with the underboss you did a favor/mission for.The game is set in 1968 New Bordeaux. And the world of New Bordeaux is so enticing. Since it is 1968, as I&rsquo;m sure many of you have already read, the game does not take it easy in the slightest of the issues on racism. If you&rsquo;re an all white neighborhood, the pedestrians, will call you names, spit towards you, insult you, and women will sometimes hide their purses. I think it&rsquo;s really cool seeing the NPCs react this way in a video game, it feels very alive in my opinion, really gives you the sense that you&rsquo;re in this world with Lincoln Clay. Another example is the police and how they react when you commit a crime. If you&rsquo;re in poor neighborhood with the people of that district primarily being black. You&rsquo;ll hear the dispatcher say something along the lines of &ldquo;Hey any unit nearby, there has been a grand theft auto, maybe you can check it out if you have some time.&rdquo; As when you&rsquo;re white neighborhood, the dispatcher will have a complete different tone, and rather then the police taking their time showing up, sometimes not showing up at all, you&rsquo;ll hear sirens right away, and within 20 to 30 second the police have arrived at the scene, and once they see that you&rsquo;re black, they&rsquo;re more of a shoot first ask questions later type attitude. One other cool thing that the Hanger 13 does with this open world and NPCs is the events that are going on around you. You&rsquo;ll walk by crimes being made, police brutality, couples being in love, and Marcano&rsquo;s men interogating someone, like hanging him off of a roof, blackmailing, or shooting someone in an inconspicuous area with an already made grave. It&rsquo;s really awesome, and pulls you in even more in this world of New Bordeaux.The sound in this game is done pretty well, in terms of music the it&rsquo;s phenomenal, the soundtrack couldn&rsquo;t possibly be better with the time and setting you&rsquo;re in, the only sound that I found annoying was the cars. In my opinion the cars are really over done, and loud with every car. The sounds of pedestrians, guns, etc..great! The voice work is perfect.I&rsquo;ve read online that there are A LOT of bugs, I have experienced some, but nothing game breaking or really annoying that made me stop to think about. Not once has my game crashed, like many others have stated (I put in 9 hours straight yesterday) the only bugs I found throughout 19 hours so far with the game, have been a car appearing out of nowhere or disappearing. My mini map zooming all the way in, to the point it became useless to use for a few minutes, and last only once did I experience a graphical hiccup where my screen was full of pixals similar to Assassins Creed games, but it lasted a second or two and didn&rsquo;t happen again. Any other glitches/bugs that other people have stated I haven&rsquo;t experienced.<strong><em>Closing</em></strong> I&rsquo;m in a downtown area, that is primarily white upper class folks. My mission, &ldquo;Rob the Cop bar&rdquo; I have two ways to approach this. One walk in the front guns blazing, walk around the back take out a few enemies, and steal what needs to be stolen. It was broad daylight, and I decide to walk in, and wing it. I step in through the front entrance, and immediately, about 8 cops, and 5 of Marcano&rsquo;s men just stop what they&rsquo;re doing and stare at me, start screaming racial slurs, telling me to get the **** out. The radio is playing in the background, and the host of the station is talking about one of the cranes I just blew up in the downtown area causing major destruction a few hours prior to this. I stop and stare and look around the room to quickly set up an escape plan. Within seconds I decide to sucker punch the cop slowly walking towards me, and suddenly, &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t It Be Nice&rsquo; by The Beach Boys is blasting on the radio, and next thing I realize it&rsquo;s an all out bar brawl. It&rsquo;s punches are being thrown everywhere, I knock out a few enemies, also taking a few punches myself, as the song is hitting it&rsquo;s peak, a car drives by the front of the bar. All of a sudden this bar brawl was an all out shootout, I had about four enemies left inside the bar, and four more outside, shooting having fly through from the outside of the glass windows and walls. I quickly take cover behind the pool table, throw a molotav, burning a few men, I run to the back bullets flying right past me, get the blueprint map, and exit out the back door stealing a cop car outside, and drive out the alley, all while The Beach Boys were playing. If this doesn&rsquo;t excite, then the game the isn&rsquo;t for you, but these kind of things happen all of the time in the game, so if you like that kind of action, I&rsquo;d recommend buying it! :)If I was to rate this from 1 to 10 I would give it an 8, but for some people this might be a 7, because of the repetitive missions. They get very mundane. However anything lower than a 7 I would disagree with. Anyway thank you for reading my review, hope it helped in your decision!</p>

<h5 id="was-skeptical-from-the-mixed-reviews-but-definitely-lived-up-to-the-hype">Was skeptical from the mixed reviews, but definitely lived up to the hype.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do I start? This game was both heavily under &amp; overrated when it came out, so I waited for the price to drop.There is a lot of big picture thinking in this game and the narrative is amazing. I found a couple bugs here and there, but they are pretty minor in the long run, aside from the game crashing only once so far in my play-through. I am not completely done yet, as I am a completionist and plan to get all the collectibles and pass all the side missions, but I have started on the second set of Lieutenants and believe I am around 20 - 30% through the game, so let&rsquo;s go through the seven sandbox categories.BUGS- Every once in a while, I will come across an enemy or vehicle that is stuck, but they hardly affect gameplay.- The game did crash on me once so far after I died during a mission, and I am not sure why, but I would not be surprised if it was a fluke.DRIVING- Driving took a bit to get used to, especially with random street cars, which I usually just take, but after you unlock the vehicle delivery, you will most likely just use the better cars, like Clay&rsquo;s Drifter. Overall, very realistic driving with old, heavy cars and no ABS.- I usually thumb the throttle when you are off-road, or you are just going to spin the tires and get nowhere.- I&rsquo;m glad they took a page out of GTA&rsquo;s book and did the slow-mo driving. This helps immensely when trying to get away from the cops or completing a turn after you oversteer and start sliding.- This may fall under gunplay, but it has more to do with driving. You can use your side-arm to automatically target enemy tires and blow them out, or drop explosives from your car window.ENEMY AI- I play as stealthy as possible, although am very confident in the game&rsquo;s abilities should a firefight break out.- Enemies actually look for each other if they wait to long to report to their post, which works to your advantage because they usually come to you one at a time. One time, three of them came to find out where their buddy when and I took all three of them on by surprise.- Anytime you melee kill an enemy from cover, the game will automatically put them behind your cover, but you can move them further away, if you notice an enemy&rsquo;s overlapping &ldquo;beats.&rdquo;- Hiding from the cops is usually easy since people have to actually find a payphone to call, but it does mean you cannot come into the blue areas until they cancel the call unless you can be very stealthy about it. Once they do find you, however, they can be quite vigilant.GRAPHICS- The graphics are smooth and amazing - I have not experienced any frame-rate loss and am confounded how this is possible. Driving between districts is does not cause any hang-ups.- The non-cinematic cutscenes are shot from a fixed angle and are not the most exciting, but this is the only gripe in this area.GUNPLAY- All the guns have a distinct feel and although you can only carry two at a time, with limited ammo, it&rsquo;s not always a rifle and a pistol. There are shotgun and SMG sidearms. My favorite combination is an SMG and a shotgun sidearm, but I have not even unlocked half of the weapons.- I tried to play with auto-aim off for the realism, but it is honestly a lot more fun with the auto-aim on - I felt like I was wasting a lot of ammo shooting people from too far away with the wrong gun, but now it is a lot better.- Throwables included proximity mines, frags, molotovs, and voodoo dolls (useful for getting a group of enemies together and take them out). You cannot &ldquo;cook&rdquo; grenades, but they are usually more useful for blowing up vehicles anyway.- This ties into stealth, but I like how there is an incapacitate option in the game menu, in case you want to go non-lethal. On the first playthrough, I am killing everyone I can unless they make me more money not to.SOUND- There are only a few radio stations in cars, but all three are packed with plenty of songs you will actually not mind hearing over and over again. Also, there are news commercials after you complete missions that tell you what a bad influence you are in the city. Very minor but thought-out thing: the radio stations actually get distorted when driving through a tunnel! I laughed out loud when I realized this.- The guns, explosions, engines, squealing tires, everything is on point.- When you are using the 6th sense mode, conversations may appear much closer than they are, but unless someone is shooting or highlighted in red, you don&rsquo;t generally have to worry about them.STORY IMMERSION / COLLECTIBLES- Cinematic cutscenes are amazing and really help tell the story from present and &ldquo;past from the future&rdquo; tense.- I found myself wanting to skip some of the shorter cutscenes between you and your partners, but I love the enemy cutscenes and how Clay always breaks the bad guy&rsquo;s elbow when he recruits them.- The racist epithets are more prevalent than I have heard in my life, but I respect the developers for putting them in and not pretending those racist times were not as disgusting as they actually were. Lincoln Clay is in his own league of badass and it never seems to bother him.- The collectibles are not difficult to find. They appear as blue icons on the map after hacking fuseboxes in districts, and are definitely nice to look (they come in the form of Vargas paintings, album covers, and auto &amp; Playboy magazines)</p>

<h5 id="worth-the-time-well-done">Worth the time. Well done</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was a good game that kept me entertained for a few days. I am on my second play to get a different story and I still like it. It can get repetitive for sure but I am okay with that. Story and graphics are quite good. Its a longer game than I thought so definitely worth the 20 I paid for it. Looking forward to the next Mafia game if there ever is one. A few glitches every now and then but nothing game breaking for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="controls-suck">Controls Suck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The story and soundtrack were the only stand outs in this game. The controls are terrible as well as the car play especially when shooting. The buttons that do multiple things become a burden when playing. I did finish the game and liked the the fact I did. I also feel bad for the people that spent $65 on a game that wasn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>

<h5 id="great-game-the-1968-setting-is-great">Great game. The 1968 setting is great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great game. The 1968 setting is great. Any history/nostalgia fan should get this game. The music is awesome. It feels more &ldquo;real&rdquo; and less of a parody like Grand Theft Auto.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well it certainly was fun while it lasted. The campaign gets pretty repetitive since the whole baseline lies on the fact that you have to draw out mob bosses by destroying rackets, then you kill the boss and assign said racket to one of three associates. Once you beat the game, it&rsquo;s basically like well what do I do now? I own the city and all you can really do is those optional objectives which also get pretty repetitive. I thought that by taking control of the entire city that the police wouldn&rsquo;t care what I do but I guess that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-fun-but-gets-very-repetitive-as-the-story-progresses">Very fun, but gets very repetitive as the story progresses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first started playing this game I thought the game was awesome and it was very fun. But after a certain point the game becomes very, very repetitive. Literally just about every district you take over is played out the exact same. The first five hours I would give a 4.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, but after you progress the game does not offer much more except the same ole same ole.</p>
