Product Description
The brilliance of OLED makes previously impossible performance a reality. The ability to switch off individual pixels renders the blacks truly black, creating an infinite contrast ratio. Its exquisite, nuanced colors actually exceed the industry’s BT.709 standard, for more natural, lifelike reproduction of all content. OLED provides super-clear action and it can all be appreciated from a virtually unlimited viewing angle.</p>

<h5 id="this-tv-is-phenomenal-but-it-is-not-the-holy-grail-of-image-quality-lg-would-like-you-to-believe">This TV is phenomenal, but it is not the holy grail of image quality LG would like you to believe.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying I am an avid videophile who regularly uses top-end CRTs and plasmas. I have had my eye on OLED for over a decade and with both CRT and plasma extinct there is a lot riding on OLED. This television shows a lot of promise for the technology, but its implementation unfortunately is not up to par with older display technologies in certain key areas that are important to me.Black level is perfect much of the time (if there is enough contrast on the screen), but at mid-APL (average pixel luminance) levels some unusual vertical banding artifacts occur that cause the center of the screen to produce cloudy grey bands instead of pure black. This makes a very dark movie like Eden Log a rather unpleasant experience at best; the black level is constantly shifting for large vertical strips of the screen, something that does not happen watching this film on a good plasma or CRT.Motion clarity is also not what LG wants you to believe. It is true the pixels respond quicker than even plasma, but the display uses sample-and-hold, and as such it actually looks worse than plasma (whose pixels are not the same brightness for an entire frame) in many situations. This manifests itself as ungodly amounts of judder in film-based content, which can only be corrected if you enable motion smoothing. If you are used to LCD displays this might not bother you, but I am used to plasma and CRT, and the quality of motion on this display is downright disgusting on content below 60 FPS. Do not expect to play contemporary PS4 or Xbox One games on this TV, at 30 FPS (the current norm) judder is unbearable in most games I have tried; a good plasma is what you need for games at that frame rate. PC gaming works great, however, if you have a machine that can sustain a solid 60 FPS (but to do this at 4K you need a GPU with HDMI 2.0 output, HDMI 1.4 is only capable of 4K @ 30 Hz at full PC RGB color range).Image retention is a very real problem on this display and LG includes neither a pixel orbiter feature or a scrolling bar to prevent/reduce it. Fortunately it is not as bad as it is on most plasmas, but you still do not want to run games at full contrast because their HUD will be retained after long sessions.It&rsquo;s not all negative, thankfully!Energy consumption is absolutely stellar for such a high-contrast display; it uses about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> as much power as my 55&rdquo; Panasonic VT60 while producing an image many times brighter. Further, it generates next to no heat compared to any comparable plasma and of course no buzzing.Screen curvature, which I thought would be a nuisance, has actually turned out to be a blessing. If nothing else, having a curved screen significantly reduces the amount of visible glare and puts this TV far ahead of even the best light filtered plasma. You will not notice any actual image warping because the amount of curvature is so little, you actually have to remind yourself that the TV is curved most of the time.Color is accurate enough out of the box that I have nothing positive or negative to say about it. UHD Blu-Ray content still does not exist, so there is very little content that can actually be used to properly test the expanded color gamut OLED is capable of producing. For cable and traditional Blu-Ray, the TV has no trouble at all and the TV does not try to incorrectly apply a wide color gamut to broadcast television as I have seen Samsung plasmas do when set to &ldquo;auto.&ldquo;The speakers are so-so. They&rsquo;re pretty respectable for built-in, but not at all what you expect when a venerable name like Harman/Kardon is involved. I have an actual Harman/Kardon stereo soundbar underneath this TV, ironically. The soundbar is quite possibly the best sounding on the market, the speakers in this TV on the other hand are far from it - my 11 year old SONY 34XBR960 CRT has better built-in speakers.WebOS 2.0 and this year&rsquo;s updated remote control are also a sign that LG&rsquo;s ready to be taken more seriously as a player in high-end televisions. Samsung still has the best smart TV implementation by far, but I would go as far as to say LG has produced a more intuitive smart TV than Panasonic VIErA. However, the choice not to include an SD card slot seems a little unusual - this is standard equipment on all other comparable smart TVs.The bottom line, and the reason I am not giving this TV 5 stars, is that my old plasmas still beat this television in certain image quality metrics. For the price of this TV and the fact that plasma is no longer manufactured, this should be superior in every measure. LG needs to abandon sample-and-hold and work out their black uniformity issues before I will give any of their OLEDs 5 stars.This may sound like sacrilege, but unless you have money to burn, I would suggest picking up a used 1080p plasma (ideally Panasonic&rsquo;s last model year) instead of this or any other LG OLED TV. Contrast will not be as good, but black uniformity and motion clarity will make watching movies on them a much more pleasant experience. Wait a few more years before adopting OLED, LG has a few issues that still need to be sorted out.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-tv-best-of-best-2016-has-hdr-over-hdmi-otherwise-this-is-the-one">Awesome TV, best of best. 2016 has HDR over HDMI, otherwise this is the one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing TV and OLED has to be seen to be believed. Guess all of us holding out since Plasma died a graceful death at 1080P never making it to 4K, this is the one. Means all OLEDs in LG lineup. Does not matter which one. And for under $2500 brand new for 65&rdquo; this was the real deal. Yes lacks HDR over HDMI, but frankly at $1500 difference between this and 2016 model, this is no brainer. It can still do HDR for 4K streaming with HDR content. Tested this with samples from Netflix after firmware upgrade. So unless you are missing out on 4K Blu rays with HDR, this is a non issue. Remember LG launched this as theor flagship for 2015 at $7000 orginally this TV. The Smarts on this is great and LG platform is very fast and easy to use. For the folks who like to customize it to the nth degree, has 2 modes of ISF calibration with 10 point adjustment over parameters to get it exactly the way you like it. Sound is awesome with HK designed speakers, but mine is in HT setting so its a mute point&hellip;</p>

<p>This TV is an absolute game changer. I&rsquo;ve had LCD&rsquo;s for as long as I can remember and the colors on this TV are simply stunning. The web os 2.0 on this SMART machine is next level. I&rsquo;ve already downloaded apps, connected my netflix, amazon video, pandora, etc to this and look for any reason to turn it on everyday. The best part, I haven&rsquo;t even gotten to use the Ultra HD or the 3D components yet and I already love this thing. Besides the performance, it&rsquo;s atheistically GORGEOUS. Thinner than my iphone 6s, the curved is just an eye-popper, the white back looks so clean. I can keep going but I&rsquo;m trying to watch the world series and type this review at the same time. If you&rsquo;re on the fence between this and another lcd tv, spend the few hundred extra and go with the future of televisions.</p>

<h5 id="simply-the-most-stunning-picture-i-have-ever-seen-on-any-tv-period">Simply the most stunning picture I have EVER seen on any TV. Period.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This really isn&rsquo;t the place to write a detailed technical review, but I will tell you, as very review I have seen that OLED technology is by far and away MILES over anything on the market today in terms of picture quality &ndash; brightness, resolution, contrast, gamma, color gamut &ndash; nothing comes close. As for me personally who works in the business and know what I want in a picture display, this is the BEST TV image I have EVER seen. Period. All the other stuff &ndash; the bells and whistles are insignificant. I am not particularly fond of the remote design, the menu setup, this and that. The curved screen &ndash; some like it, some don&rsquo;t. I think it&rsquo;s a harmless gimmick to mimic movie theatres curved screen (those that have them) but the minute you close the lights and start watching a movie, you forget there is even a curve there. BUT, none of it that small stuff MATTERS, with this TV, it is ALL BOUT THE SUPER PICTURE QUALITY.Not a person so far who has looked at that the picture as it sits in the living room has not commented on how beautiful the picture is&hellip;and I am talking ordinary Joes who are not vidophiles or tech pros &ndash; to a person, all have been moved to say how spectacular they thought the picture looked. That has to tell you something.The one thing I will quibble about, but when you put it in context of the image quality, it&rsquo;s not enough for me to even subtract a star, is the sound quality. It&rsquo;s thin. Thing is, when someone is spending the hefty price tag of this TV, you really are expected to be hooking it up to a sound system that at least compliments the picture. LG, while they won&rsquo;t say this, really doesn&rsquo;t think you will be listening to the speakers in the TV set. It would be like buying a Lamborgini and putting in regular gas.Not a fan of 3D? THIS TV&rsquo;s 3D quality will change your mind. Buy the 3D BluRay of TITANIC or HOUSE OF WAX or JURASSIC PARK, and you will become a fan instantly!! It is like you are right there IN the picture! No artifacts, no ghosting, a bright, stunning 3D picture that you can reach out and touch. BETTER than in the theatres!! Honestly. If you&rsquo;re one of the ones who have been saying that you don&rsquo;t think 3D adds to the immersion feeling when watching a movie, be prepared to be proven wrong. After 5 minutes watching a 3D movie, you forget the glasses are even on; you forget that it&rsquo;s 3D because 3D is the natural way you see life ALL THE TIME. It becomes as totally natural as real life. And no stupid three pound active glasses on your head to mess with either, with their batteries that ALWAYS die out just when you decide to watch a 3D movie or WORSE, some 20 minutes before the END of a 3D movie! This passive system uses VERY lightweight polariod glasses, same as the RealD 3D glasses you get when you go to the cinema, which, BTW, you should always take home so you will have plenty for when you have a 3D movie party in front of this awesome 3DTV set! (you SHOULD take those 3D glasses home when you leave the movie theatre; they make you think that you need to return them, but you don&rsquo;t, because YOU PAID FOR THEM! &ndash; IMAX glasses won&rsquo;t work).OK, do you think I like this TV? 100% yes! I can&rsquo;t tell you how glad I am that I bought it. Sure, if you wait, the price of OLED technology will probably come down, but if you can afford it now, it is SO good a TV that I say, treat yourself! If you can afford it, you will enjoy this for all the time you might be without, waiting for a price drop.One last thing &ndash; while this is expensive, it pretty much will bullet-proof you against technology obsolescence (always an issue in this super fast changing electronics segment. This set is so ahead of the curve that whatever happens for the next many years, this 4k, OLED TV will be able to play it.</p>
