<h5 id="i-m-glad-that-i-bought-it">I&rsquo;m Glad That I Bought It</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 85MB/s 64GB Micro SD comes with the full size adapter and formatted exFAT, with the final capacity of 60.5GB. This model that I purchased is the UHS speed class U1 standard, which is what the SD Association recommends for everything except 4K recording. For 4k recording, a card capable of 30MB/s or better write speeds is what you should purchase.I have several of the UHS class cards from different manufacturers ranging from the earlier 50MB/s class to the 90MB/s models and I have no complaints with this card, it&rsquo;s been fast and perfect.As much as I dislike amateur bench marking, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I found out from 3 different programs, while using 2 different USB 3 readers. The read speed is capable of over 85MB/s and was up to 89 in one test, the writes came in slow at 22MB/s. But the write speed is normal for this card because the minimum write speed standard for UHS U1 is only 10MB/s. If you&rsquo;re looking for the faster write speed, then you want the more expensive 45/90MB/s model. With UHS U3 cards, the minimum write speed standard is 30MB/s instead of the UHS U1 10MB/s write speed like this model.Edit: I just stopped back here to take a look and I feel the need to add this because I&rsquo;m seeing disappointed buyers. I apologize to those who know all of this and find it redundant.Addressing the several reviews that complain that this drive isn&rsquo;t really 64GB, that&rsquo;s the size of the drive before formatting. This isn&rsquo;t some bait and switch, this is how all formatted drives work and if you check your computers 1TB drive or whatever it uses, you&rsquo;ll see that it isn&rsquo;t 1TB after formatting either, this is completely normal.Addressing those who think that this doesn&rsquo;t reach it&rsquo;s advertised speeds, I suggest that you download ATTO and or CrystalDiskMark, run it and watch what happens. What you&rsquo;ll find out is that it depends on file sizes and whether they&rsquo;re sequential or random reads, and that it should reach 85 MB/s or very close, using USB 3. If it doesn&rsquo;t, exchange it because mine does. But that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s max, and very small random reads are slow. Do the same with 5 other cards and they will all behave the same way. But if you don&rsquo;t know how to test drives or you received a bad card, writing a review that&rsquo;s misinformation isn&rsquo;t helping anyone, this is why I dislike amateur benchmarking. Doing my very best I&rsquo;m still not in a laboratory using millions of dollars in testing gear, but at least I do know how to interpret the benchmarking results, and the card that I purchased exceeds the advertised speed. <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub> and the card is still good.Another edit: I have just replied to a comment made towards the SDA and myself accusing us of having a lessor intelligence quotient than some readers here, and I only bring this up to defend the SDA who cannot respond. 4k video does not record at 30 MB/s and neither the SDA nor I have said that it does. But a card&rsquo;s class rating, and the synthetically bench marked speed, and the real world speed, and the actual speed when it&rsquo;s used in your camera, will all be different. This card is in the write speed class rated at 10 MB/s because it doesn&rsquo;t reach 30 MB/s and this class would also include slower 5 year old Class 10 cards struggling to reach a 10 MB/s write speed.The testing to reach 10 MB/s would also all be done with a brand new card containing no information, and as it gets older and full, you will experience slower write speeds. So the SDA made a safe, blanket statement about this class of cards use with 4k and I repeated their safe statement because it will be true much more often than it will be false, with so many more old cards when compared to what was released just 6-8 months ago. My apologies for any confusion and here&rsquo;s a rule of thumb: You don&rsquo;t want to use an older Class 10 card for recording 4k, and that&rsquo;s this cards write speed class too. But because this card writes at twice the minimum speed, it will likely work for you when it&rsquo;s new, although that could change with age and how close to full it gets. The faster 30+ MB/s write speed cards should always work for you unless there&rsquo;s a compatibility issue, even when it&rsquo;s old and nearly full.The write speed of this 64GB card of mine in real world performance when new, was at 16-17 MB/s in my computer and will no doubt be much slower when it&rsquo;s closer to full, and I can&rsquo;t say how fast it will write in your camera. Again, here on 1/12/16 my card is performing flawlessly in my tablet. It&rsquo;s a good card, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be my choice when purchasing one for recording 4k.64GB Micro SD cards have typically been a bit faster writing than the same card in 32 or 16GB and I think that&rsquo;s true here with this card also. 128GB Micro SD cards have been slower in comparison until just recently when Samsung introduced it&rsquo;s new 128GB Micro Pro Plus <sup>90</sup>&frasl;<sub>95</sub> card, so that will be changing when everyone catches up, and SanDisk offers the same speed in up to 64GB. Over time and use your card will slow down but you can do a full format on it with your computer to speed it back up again, because this will &lsquo;clean&rsquo; it, unlike quick formats. So give that a try if your card has slowed down.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;This has been used as the write disk in my tablet for about three weeks now and it&rsquo;s been reliable, but one reason for choosing this card was from my own past experience. About 18 months ago I took a chance on an inexpensive 64GB flash drive to be used as an external, second drive with my little Intel NUC computer and it&rsquo;s been running full time ever since without a problem.You guessed right, the thumb drive is also a Silicon Power and I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m taking a chance this time.So then you must also know that from my own experience with this company and this purchase, that I recommend this card.</p>

<h5 id="best-value-high-speed-microsd-card-i-m-aware-of">Best value high speed microSD card I&rsquo;m aware of</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent price for the speed and capacity. Purchased for use in a GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Only had one hiccup. GoPro reported an SD card error after a very long sustained recording, but I popped it into a PC and the recordings made that evening were intact. Still not sure what the source of the error was. May have been the camera, which I&rsquo;ve had very little experience with. I&rsquo;ve attached ATTO benchmark results using a Lexar USB 3.0 microSD reader. Given the camera use case, I&rsquo;m more concerned with write speed than the advertised read speed. Both seem to be adequate.It&rsquo;s important to remember the distinction between figures in megabITS per second and megaBYTES per second. &ldquo;MB&rdquo; is megabytes, &ldquo;Mb&rdquo; is megabits. If this card writes at 20 MBps, that&rsquo;s more than adequate for the bitrate of video the GoPro seems to record.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-tech-challenged-but-this-card-is-easy-to-use-even-for-me">I&rsquo;m tech-challenged, but this card is easy to use (even for me!)!! =)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this memory card for my Galaxy S5, and it performed well. When I upgraded to an S7 Edge, I popped the card into the S7, and it works like a dream.I&rsquo;m not a techie-type person. In fact, I know practically nothing about phones, computers, etc, except the basics of how to operate the ones I own.When I needed a memory card, I asked my son what he recommended, and he sent me a link to this card. That&rsquo;s how I &ldquo;chose&rdquo; it. ;)If you are like me (technically challenged!), but need a memory card for your S5 or S7, then this is a good pick. I popped it in, it worked, it was easy to move my photos over to the card. Once I put the card into my phone, my phone automatically began putting new photos onto the card. Easy-peasy! =)I can heartily recommend this card for your Samsung S5 or S7 phone. =)</p>

<h5 id="awesome-sd-card-reliable-great-price-and-functional">Awesome SD card, reliable, great price, and functional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:Great priceHuge storage (I use it for my videos and files storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note)Reliable (I have been working this little card for about a year now and so far there are no glitches, no corrupt files, and no issues)Cons:The speed of the SD card, while fast enough for 1080p videos, lags a bit when recording 4K videos or shooting consecutive pictures. There is a noticeable difference between using my internal RAM versus using the SD card while taking pictures. The SD card lags about half a second llonger than the internal SD, not a huge difference but if you are a spam photographer who is trigger happy, then I might get a higher speed SD card.Overall:Can&rsquo;t beat the price and reliability of this SD card. It does everything under normal usage: playing HD videos, recording 1080p videos, pictures, voice recordings, saving large files, etc. It&rsquo;s a lot better than spending hundreds more for a larger internal storage on your phone!</p>
