<h5 id="issues-shuts-off-sound-randomly-but-problem-solved">Issues: Shuts off sound randomly BUT PROBLEM SOLVED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my fiance&rsquo;s birthday today. Below is my post previous to finding on google an Amazon post back in 2013 that helped us resolve the issue. Read what our problem was then I posted below a review I found through google that helped us solve. So anyone with this problem read my entire post. On 5-28-2016: Hooked up today and already having issues. Hooked it up to my 65inch Samsung TV and whenever we rewind or fast-forward on the DVR the sound bar sound cuts off the sound completely but the sound bar is still on. In order to fix the issue we have to turn off the TV and then turn the TV back on. This has happened 6 times in the past 3 hours that we have had it hooked up. I am very disappointed. I think I will send this back and get a different brand. SOLUTION FOUND On 5-29-2016: ATTENTION PEOPLE WHO CAN&rsquo;T FIGURE OUT HOW TO PREVENT THE SOUND BAR FROM GOING SILENT INBETWEEN CHANNEL CHANGING/inbetween cutscenes in a game:::I have seen several people mention that they dislike how the sound bar automatically seems to turn off the moment it stops receiving any audio signal, even if it&rsquo;s very brief. I have even read how some customers ended up returning the product because they couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to turn off this feature. Reading the manual I found the solution where I least expected it. You can turn off this automatic default feature by turning off the VZtv Rmt setting. For some reason, they combined the automatic sound bar turn off with the VIZIO TV remote setting. Anyways, once you turn it off the soundbar no longer automatically turns off when changing channels or in-between custcenes while playing a game.As for the rest of the product: It&rsquo;s great as long as you plug it in correctly. If you do not see the DOLBY DIGITAL /DTS light when you turn on your sound bar and TV, then it&rsquo;s because your tv is not outputting true 5.1 sound. Yes, your sound bar will automatically create a faux 5.1 surround, but for the real 5.1 quality you will have to connect your soundbar directly to whatever you are using to stream or play movies and not the TV.Something else I haven&rsquo;t seen other users mention is how shows you may be watching via a streaming service, such as Netflix and Crunchyroll, will not output true 5.1 even though all the settings are set up correctly and the soundbar is lit up with the DOLBY/DTS light. It seems to be because the show you are trying to stream isn&rsquo;t calibrated to output at true 5.1 for whatever reason and you end up not having any output in the satellite speakers. To get around this I take advantage of the previously mentioned faux 5.1 surround that you hear when you connect your soundbar directly to the tv.This is how my setup works so that I choose between true 5.1 and the faux 5.1 depending on what I&rsquo;m watching:I have both my PC and my PS4 connected to my TV.I have my Sound Bar connected via optical cable to my PS4 for true 5.1, which I use for playing games, movies, and streaming services.Additionally I have component cables connecting my sound bar to my TV for when something I am streaming on my PS4 isn&rsquo;t outputting true 5.1 and I want to switch to the faux 5.1, or for when I am using my TV to watch content I downloaded on my PC. You will have to change some computer settings to have your PC send audio signal to your TV for the component cables to pickup and send to the Soundbar.Just use the remote control to switch which input you want to use for sound for what you watching (Optical Cable for true 5.1, Aux for faux 5.1).You&rsquo;ll want to pump up most of the sound settings from 7 to like 9s and 11s though to get the best sound output.NOTE:::: When I connected my Sound Bar directly to my PS4, I noticed the TV was no longer in sync to the sound. This was quickly resolved by locating and selecting the &ldquo;GAME (standard)&rdquo; viewing mode on my tv. Apparently if your TV has some special effects that it applies to what you are viewing, it may cause the picture to go out of sync with the sound. Selecting the GAME view mode on your TV automatically disables any special effects your TV may be trying to apply so that it resolves any sync issues.Well that about covers it. I tried to discuss the technical stuff that I didn&rsquo;t see other users mention. It&rsquo;s a great buy and great value. Great product. 5stars.</p>

<p>I received my speaker in 2 days. Took me 1 hour to completely install and teach myself the remote control options. My $1,200 samsung TV&rsquo;s sound was good for MOST tv shows and sporting events BUT when I watched public tv and the english progamming I couldnt understand what people like Sherlock Holmes, the detective masterpiece mysteries and most all of the &ldquo;kings and queens&rdquo; movies, the accent was hard to understand. With this product I understand ALL the dialog. With this sound bar you can not only get digital audio but also trebel, bass, surround and subwoofer all easy access. It sounds better than my stereo speakers on my stereo music receivers. Small, easy to operate, easy to install (I&rsquo;m 69 years old) its just great, now I can watch all my favorite shows and understand every word.</p>

<p>Picked one up at Walmart today for $79.00 plus tax. I have to say impressive for the price.This is coming from someone who only buys huge name brand items. I was caught in a little mess. I had a LG sound bar that had sub woofers built in. ( I don&rsquo;t like the standalone subs regardless of wired or wireless). I am not a huge audiophile either. I just wanted better sound than the TV. My LG sound bar started having trouble with the built in ARC function and I used the Best Buy Geek Squad warranty on it. Problem is they lost it in shipping. They made good on money for me. However, my gripe was I was stuck with new technology that had those huge stand alone bass tubes. I was too the point that even if I spent $1,000 for a Bose system, I was going to get a bass tube. So I made a choice down grade to a lesser quality name like Vizio, Insignia, RCA, etc. I looked online and did research and found that the new 2015 model Vizio looked nice. A symmetrical perfect cube design. I figured it would look nice at the very least and had to offer some what better sound that the TV speakers.Boy was I right. The sound quality is great for a $79.00 investment. There is no thumping bass like some of you would like. Though it does give me richer sound than standard TV speakers. The volume goes higher and the sounds fill the room better.To sum it up..If you&rsquo;re stuck on having a huge system, then I understand. Grab a reputable name. I was happy with the sound quality of Bose as well as that Vacuum tube system Samsung makes. The stand alone sub just wasn&rsquo;t for me.But seriously for $79.00 where can you go wrong? It is pretty and works well. I had the volume way up with no distortion. Seems crisp enough to make me happy.I am using the 29&rdquo; bar with the included optical cable to my Samsung UN48JU7500 Tv. Works good.There is a 38&rdquo; version of this 2015 model sound bar coming as well. Adds Dolby Digital Technology. It also has a bit larger drivers. Instead of 2.5&rdquo; they are 2.75&rdquo;. The 38&rdquo; model also will have two passive radiators for more bass. It is not written on the Vizio website but I did confirm it when them. So there is a total of four speakers on the 38&rdquo; 2015 model. I suspect it will sound a bit better. The passive radiators will add 10HZ on the low. Instead of 70hz it can get to 60hz.. or so it is written.I am probably going to get the 38&rdquo; bar as well when it is released.I hope this helps. I will keep this item. Too bad I couldn&rsquo;t buy it from Amazon.com.</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-no-help-from-vizio">Buyer Beware - No help from Vizio</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Revised after two months of use. Sound bar worked great for two months and then started buzzing and cutting out. Just over two months and too long for Amazon&rsquo;s 60 day free help. Numerous attempts to call Vizio Tech Support left me holding the phone for 30 minutes at a time and never any help. I no longer recommend this item. No tech support and the website is useless as well, so buyer beware.</p>
