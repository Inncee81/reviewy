<h5 id="an-outstanding-4k-action-camera">An outstanding 4K action camera.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> An outstanding product.Very easy to setup and start using.This camera comes in a very useful zippered hard shell case together with a large selection of mounts and accessories.It includes a remote control for the camera which is a huge plus and 2 batteries.A word of caution - you MUST use an Micro SD card class 10 or higher and a USP Speed Class 3 (U3)There is an App (XDV) available for download that connects to your camera via WiFi making it very easy to see exactly what your camera is seeing. Excellent video quality.SPECS:Wide angle lens (170°)Language selection 7 selections to choose fromRecord 4K @ 30fps,1920 x 1080 @ 60fps.1920 x 1080 @ 30fps.1280 x 720 @ 90fps.Video format MP4Photo resolution 16MP, 12MP, 8MP, 5MP, 2MP.Slow motion video.Record time: approx 90 mins at 1080PRecharge time: 2 hours.In my opinion this is an excellent, budget friendly buy for a 4K action camera.Well worth the price and highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="great-camera-but-sdxc-cards-over-32gb-cannot-be-read-from-external-card-reader">Great camera, but SDXC cards over 32GB cannot be read from external card reader</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera is a good upgrade to my SJ6000. I have it mounted to my helmet when I ride on the motorcycle. Videos are clear and the driving mode is key. They driving mode basically starts recording as soon as it turns on. Pretty helpful if I forget to turn it on before I get on my bike. Remote is really cool too. I can snap photos with a click of the button on the remote.Only issue I have with this camera is that it kinda supports 64GB SD cards. What I mean by that is that it can use 64GB cards to store the videos, but it formats the 64GB SD card as FAT32. Well FAT32 can only go up to 32GB so when I try to put the 64GB SDXC card into a USB 3.0 SDXC card reader attached to my laptop it won&rsquo;t read it. The laptop complains that the card is not formatted. So the only way to read the data on the card is by connecting the camera itself to the laptop but because the USB interface on the camera is USB 2.0 transfer rate of 4K quality video takes much longer. Using a 32GB card works fine.Other than that, the camera is great for the price.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">five stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first action camera and now &ldquo;I get it&rdquo;! This camera packs a ton of features in a very small package. For my uses, I wish that there was a standard tripod connector on the camera itself, but there is an easy solution among what seems like a dozen different connectors and clips and straps. The case that this camera comes with is literally fill of them. And I love how it comes with an extra battery. The main features that I am looking forward to the time-lapse and the slow motion. I don&rsquo;t have anything to compare this camera to, so maybe there is something cool that is &ldquo;missing&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t even know about, but I would not hesitate in recommending this camera to anyone. For the price, I don&rsquo;t think you could beat the feature set and accessories.</p>

<h5 id="full-function-with-less-cost">full function with less cost</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this jeemk 4K for a couple of days now so I can only speak to what I&rsquo;ve seen so far. The camera and included attachments came securely packaged and exactly as described. After reading several reviews on Amazon and other websites, I decided to pull the trigger.I was prepared to pay over $300 for a GoPro but after finding the Jeemak, I thought it was worth a try. With a separate accessory package and a 64GB memory card, my total purchase was just under $90!Be sure to order a memory card with your camera!The 1080 video is great! The included waterproof case has worked perfectly so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-buy">Very good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jeemak Action Cam is a great buy at a good price. It comes with many attachments to configure a nice connection to your equipment (bike, helmet, etc.). There are so many connections that I haven&rsquo;t figured them all out yet. More experienced users of this type of equipment should know exactly how to use each piece. The case is waterproof. All pieces seem to be of good quality.NOTE: The remote doesn&rsquo;t seem to be waterproof so be careful with that.This comes with two batteries which is great for extended time outdoors. I have not ran a battery down yet so I&rsquo;m not sure how long they last.</p>

<h5 id="received-this-amazing-camera-and-was-thrilled-to-find-all-the-attachments">Received this amazing camera and was thrilled to find all the attachments &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received this amazing camera and was thrilled to find all the attachments that came with it. It is one thing to see it online and quite another to see it in person. The case it all comes in is very nice and will be helpful to keep us from losing any parts as it holds everything! At first, was a little overwhelmed with all the pieces parts until we found a nice visual of which parts went with which parts. Overall, it is pretty simple to use.When using the app, remember that when setting up WiFi, you are not pairing with your WiFi router, you are pairing directly to the camera.I hope your experience is as good as ours!Jeemak 4K Action Cam 16MP WiFi Waterproof Sports Camera 170° Ultra Wide Angle Len with SONY Sensor,Remote Control 2 Pcs Rechargeable Batteries and Portable Package</p>

<h5 id="comes-with-bunch-of-useful-accessories-and-2-batteries">Comes with bunch of useful accessories and 2 batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, wow, wow. First of all, I want to tell that this is my honest review for Jeemak camera. In the package you can find the card with instructions how to get the gift for positive review. Despite of this the camera worth 5 star rating. 1. Can&rsquo;t see the clarity difference between GoPro4, 2. Price is $60. 3. Comes with bunch of useful accessories and 2 batteries. Everything works with no fail including WiFi, remote control, waterproof case (spend all day long in the water snorkeling). Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="it-records-everything-in-4k">It records everything in 4k</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product is similar gopro. The functions are similar. But the price is at a good discount. I bought it as a try. It comes out recording great images and videos at 4k quality. And it can be used in different ways. The action cam also comes with 16 pieces of hardware which helps you carrying it in different body position. Recommended for people on vacation. Nice and fun when you can record it in your own vision.</p>
