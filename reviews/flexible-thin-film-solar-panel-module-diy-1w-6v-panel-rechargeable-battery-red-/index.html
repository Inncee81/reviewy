<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Color:red
Specifications:</p>

<p>Power Output: ~6V @ 1W (~160 mA)
Output Type: DC Voltage
Dimensions: 100mm / 3.94&rdquo; x 198.43mm / 7.81&rdquo; x 0.77mm / 0.03&rdquo;

<p>Material:</p>

<p>Packaging assembly using UV curable polymer, to ensure a high durability. The package includes EVA polymers and fluoropolymers ETEE (high endurance ETEE is highly light-transmissive polymer); Portable PV components field work and travel to meet the supplemental power requirements.</p>

<p>Feature:</p>

<p>•Flexible (foldable): provide free design space for architects, and can connect with bending surface, meet the aesthetic requirement for BIPV
•Lightweight: especially suitable for some installation surfaces is sensitive to weight.
•Durable: polyester film encapsulated, ultraviolet resistant, moisture resistant, the application which over 10 years under extreme conditions have been proven by research, widely use for satellite, ocean, military various fields.
•Without glass: Don’t breakage if stroked by hail, however, monocrystalline silicon or polycrystalline silicon solar modules stocked by hail, maybe need replacement solar modules, if so, will happen much cost. Also can walk on the flexible solar modules freely, it’s easy for installation and maintenance.
•Shadow tolerance: good outside working performance under low light condition.
•Superior performance under high light condition: 10%-20% higher power input than monocrystalline silicon or polycrystalline solar modules under high temperature.
•Higher power generation. High Efficiency Shadow Tolerance Loss (4%-5%) Power Output Warranty Reduce not higher than 20% within 25 years Low Light Performance 20% higher generating capacity
•Good self-cleaning: the surface has high pollution resistant, easy clean, climate resistant features, normally; dirt can be discharged clean by rain.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-though-basic-soldering-skills-required">Works well,though basic soldering skills required.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The design and quality of this panel is excellent. The solar panel is lightweight, durable and waterproof. I&rsquo;ve wanted to experiment with solar energy for awhile now and decided I will make a charger for my cell phone, so that when I&rsquo;m outdoors where no plugs are available I can still charge my phone. I&rsquo;m not an electronic expert by any means but I was able to find many websites with step by step instructions to help me complete my project. It works great as long as you have sunlight. As other reviewers have stated, you will need basic soldering skills in order to use this product. It ships with no built in connectors, so you have to solder wires to the conducting pads on the back. Since I was using this in a DIY project, this was no problem for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-cool">Very cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been having all kinds of fun experimenting with this strip. It is very easy to use I use my soldering iron and had it working immediately I like how flexible it is this is really allowed me to use it in a variety of creative ways I am able to fit it into many different places to because of how thin it is so that really stands the possibilities even more . It is very flat and I am impressed at how powerful it is considering low profile it is constructed Of, I have been working on a few projects that I cannot share the exact details of because I want them to remain original but I will say that these strips are very useful and they&rsquo;re giving me an all new level of flexibility ..This is a basic product but it works well it lights up a nice amount of LED lights and you are able to use more than one if you combine it all properly I&rsquo;ll kinds of cool things definite were checking out this is a good price for theseIt&rsquo;s also been a fun project to work on with my-year-old son I am able to teach him all kinds of things and I feel like solar is going to just expanding more we know about it nowFive stars!</p>

Since I was using this in a DIY project, this was no problem for me.I bought two of these and so far have been very happy. In full sun the generate 8 volts, and wired directly to my Android phone it powered immediately. Ultimately I will use it to power a small outdoor web cam, and it seems to generate plenty of power for that.</p>

<h5 id="powerful-small-and-flexible-a-winner">Powerful, small, and flexible. A winner.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This solar panel is exactly what I needed. It generates a lot of power in the sun and even some in partial shade. I soldered wires to the connectors and used it to power a small fan. It works great! I love the fact that it is flexible. I could mount it to a curved surface. It is a small solar panel and it works amazingly well. I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-experimenting">Good for experimenting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my son, he is doing a science project , he is trying to make a cell phone charger with this. This is light weight and flexible. It is strong and dust proof. He purchased soldering iron and other stuff. I will update here once he is done his work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-expected">Works as expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using this panel in my class to demonstrate solar power. Be aware, this panel is 1 watt which is very limited in its range of application. However, the panel is very compact and flexible. This is not a plug and use product. Connection is made through clipping or soldering to two contact points ou must have some basic circuitry knowledge and skills to get this to work. Regardless, the panel works well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-solar-panel-for-diy-project">Great Solar Panel for DIY Project</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a better than I expected solar panel. The build quality is good and it&rsquo;s waterproof. There is no connectors on this panel. It only has two small holes on one side for you to connect the wire. If you don&rsquo;t know how, you can check out youtube. This is my great project to DIY a solar charger for my phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for a project and so far it worked well. Good for small projects such as mine. Price was affordable too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this for a outside circuit I made, works great.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-not-sure-how-useful-1w-is-but-it-is-there-to-use">I&rsquo;m not sure how useful 1W is but it is there to use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised! I&rsquo;m not sure how useful 1W is but it is there to use! I tried using it to power very small motor and it worked great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bendable-sunshine">Bendable Sunshine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently had the great pleasure of experimenting with this ultra thin 8 x 4-inch flexible solar panel from Jiang. The design and quality of this panel is excellent.</p>

<p>It does put out energy but connecting to that energy proved to be hard. They have two areas that seem to be meant to soldier wire to, but sadly they are also encased in plastic so&hellip;</p>
