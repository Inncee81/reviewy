<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-pulse-ox-good-price">Good pulse ox, good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had this pulse ox a few days, but I am impressed with the quality. Im a prehospital nurse and this is a great backup to have in case my monitor battery dies. It picks up quickly and is accurate. You do have to be pretty still to get a reading. I tried it with my 9 month old and I don&rsquo;t know if it was his finger being too small or him squirming but I couldn&rsquo;t get a reading. Otherwise it&rsquo;s been great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with this product. I am a Medical Assistant and use this often and it is much better than other pulse omiters I have used in the past. It is very sturdy and holds up to my slippery fingers who drop things LOL. I am not recommending that anyone drops it but if it happens it seems to still work very well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="batteries-expires-in-2017">Batteries expires in 2017 :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FOLLW-UP, APRIL 2017: The first oximeter is still working well. I reordered one for my sister. She is impressed. I showed her how to slightly move her finger if she is not getting a reading. Happy with two purchases now.INITIAL REVIEW, SEPTEMBER 2015: I am extremely satisfied with this oximeter, but the reading results disappear the same microsecond that finger is removed. And because the reading is upside down with finger resting, this makes it a tad more difficult to read. I believe this design is intended for two people&hellip;the &ldquo;finger&rdquo; person and the &ldquo;reader.&rdquo; I am one person. If finger is left in place, i can watch my readings change slightly, which is normal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-affordable-home-oximeter">Great, affordable home oximeter!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My mother suffered a blackout, had a bad fall and laceration to her head 2 months ago, with a resulting diagnosis of congestive heart failure. (Her heart stopped long enough to make her black out and fall, and she hit her head on a piece of furniture on the way down, cutting it to the bone.) Fortunately, she is doing better now and is able to stay at home with help. During the period that she fell and we were awaiting diagnosis, I purchased this Pulse Oximeter for home use to monitor her oxygen levels, because they would drop dangerously low at times. The affordable price and good reviews were a deciding factor. I&rsquo;ve tested this item against both the equipment used at our doctor&rsquo;s office and by our home nurses, and it matches their readings every time. Can&rsquo;t ask for anything more!The only negative I can comment on is that the little silicone case that comes with it does not fit properly and causes more of a drop risk than anything else, because it slips off the unit. I just keep the unit inside the protective fabric case and on the provided lanyard when not being used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="home-health-nurse-must">Home health nurse must!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I mainly use this for adults, but it can work on kids if you can get them to hold still. I got this when I was doing visits with adults and it works very well. I&rsquo;ve had it almost a year now and the batteries are still going. I switched from adult visits to peds shifts and found that it is not geared toward kids. But if you can get them to hold their fingers still it will work and read correctly. I mainly use it as a back up to in home pulse ox machines when I need to confirm numbers or for quick checks. Definitely would recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-accurate-and-easy-to-use">Very accurate and easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very accurate and easy to use. I use this on both myself and my toddler son, as we both have asthma. You have to hold still to get an accurate reading, which is a challenge with a 2 year old, however it seems to work even faster than the one at the Ped&rsquo;s office.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-product-we-tested-this-against-two-or-three">VERY good product. We tested this against two or three &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>VERY good product. We tested this against two or three different doctor&rsquo;s office oxymeters, and it was accurate. This means a lot to us, as our kids have trouble with asthma&hellip;This product is a good one and the price is very fair. Thanks! AccuMed</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-good-as-my-doctors-office-but-10x-less-expensive">As Good as my Doctors Office but 10x less Expensive.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to work fine and as close to accurate as ones my father and Dr&rsquo;s office use. I know my father paid nearly $200 for his a couple of years ago which is why it ges 5 stars from me&hellip;it&rsquo;s an excellent value at its price point.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value">good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well. As others have mentioned, the outer blue rubber &ldquo;jacket&rdquo; is too loose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Reliable and easy to use</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great item. Brings assurance and confidence that important functions are monitored.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent pulse ox</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-ll-be-useful-if-you-re-desperate-but-i-would-recommend-a-pulse">It&rsquo;ll be useful if you&rsquo;re desperate but I would recommend a pulse &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a new pulse ox right away after I lost my old expensive one. This pulse ox however has a major design flaw to me and that is that you turn it on via pressing the white&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-be-nice-if-design-was-a-little">Would be nice if design was a little</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well and quickly. Made of light weight plastic, but it&rsquo;s held up okay so far. Belt pouch is handy and the silicone cover fits, but I ended up not using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well and it&rsquo;s accurate (I checked my pulse manually)- good price too. I really debated a fitness bracelet and after reading lots of reviews I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate HR is&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Works great!</p>

<p>Great product and it was delivered right on time.</p>
