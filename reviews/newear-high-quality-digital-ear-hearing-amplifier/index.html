<h5 id="amazing">Amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My grandmother is hard of hearing. It has made her depressed and very anti-social. She was so tired of always having to ask people to repeat themselves and feeling left out of the conversation. After I bought her a pair of headphones for Christmas to connect to her tv&hellip;.she cried because it was the first time she could clearly hear the tv in years. She doesn&rsquo;t have hearing aids because they are too expensive and her insurance doesnt cover them. So I started researching alternative hearing devices and found the NewEarTM BTE Hearing amplifiers. I originally purchased the one without T-Coil because I didn&rsquo;t see it until after, but Amazon was able to cancel the original purchase and send this one to me. I am looking into ways to utilize the T-Coil function but i figured for the extra $15-20 I would rather have it than not have it.-Out of the box-Very simple. Put the battery in, turned the power switch to on and worked it great. I turned my volume down on my TV to the point where I could barely hear it. I put the amplifier in my ear and could hear everything. I could even hear my dog chewing on her bone in the next room. I was satisfied and brought it to my grandma for her to try it out. I showed her how to put it on and flipped the switch on for her. I moved about 10ft away from her and started to talk and her face lit up! She was like a kid going all over her condo and asking me to talk to see how far she could hear me from (she could hear me from 20ft away in a normal voice but it did seem to work much better when I was in front of her). I can&rsquo;t tell you the joy it brought me being able to give my grandmother a gift that made her so happy.-Notes-Buttons are a little difficult to operate with the device on your ear, mainly because they are so small.When the device is on, you will receive feedback from the earpiece getting too close to the microphone when putting it on your ear. Can be avoided if you learn how to navigate the buttons with the device on your earIt does also amplify your own voice, so you can hear yourself talk in the device. There is no delay and I see this as a positive factor so you know if you are talking too loud while wearing the device.The sound is clear but not perfect. For the price and the result of being able to have a conversation with my Grandma without yelling is a complete victory.-Paul</p>

<h5 id="great-under-the-right-conditions">GREAT UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s great under the right conditions, so my review is actually mixed. I am in my mid 50&rsquo;s and my hearing is getting bad! I have to say huh and what way to often! I turn the TV volume up way louder than my wife wants it but she tolerates it rather than having to repeat an entire movie to me. My Mother has hearing loss and I tried one of her hearing aids one day and couldn&rsquo;t believe what all I could hear. I was amazed! Not wanting to go the hearing aid route just yet I looked online and found there are hearing amplifiers all over and for great prices! Who knew! With that said, I have to say I believe this amplifier works just as well as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; and more expensive hearing aid. Problem is they both amplify everything. In a nice quiet room having a conversation or watching TV is great. I can turn the TV way down and still hear every word, but get up and go to the bathroom and flush the toilet and you will swear you&rsquo;re next to Niagara Falls! Being outside can be great hearing the birds in the trees and kids on the next block playing, but turn your ear into the wind and it&rsquo;s like a jet engine going off! Not a nice experience at all!! There is a volume control but I really can&rsquo;t tell any difference between the settings. It seems to be either amplifying or off. Battery life isn&rsquo;t bad and it seems to be well made. Not sure why they went with the gold ring on the ear plug but with the different tips I would think most people can get a good fit. So all in all and under the right conditions I think you could be happy, just don&rsquo;t stick your head out your car window!!!!</p>

<h5 id="proud-husband-caved-in-and-loves-them">Proud Husband Caved In and Loves Them!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband has worked around heavy equipment for over 23 years, his hearing, specifically his left ear, was really bad. EVERY TIME I would say to something to him he would say &ldquo;huh&rdquo; or &ldquo;what honey?&rdquo;. Before spending the big bucks on a set of hearing aids we bought two of these very reasonably priced ($36) hearing amplifiers. The TV is now at a lower level than I care for it to be! At night, he wears one in bed so he can watch TV while I sleep. He is quite pleased. He did say 1. they take time to get use to 2. the amp behind the ear makes it sound like he is yelling 3. he cannot use them outside because the wind is especially annoying to him. 4. They aren&rsquo;t exactly small and therefore not discreet with the bright gold metal piece. He won&rsquo;t wear them outside the house because of this (I know&hellip;I know, but he is only 45) See pictures attached.All and all, he&rsquo;s happy and therefore I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

<h5 id="these-work-very-well">These work very well!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 65 year old semi retired musician. My audiologist told me that I&rsquo;ve lost most of my upper range in both ears. I can&rsquo;t hear the TV, normal conversation, movies when we go to the cinema, etc. All I hear is the low end, the bass. I looked at hearing aids that were in the $2,000 - $3,000 range (for each), and my insurance only paid a small portion. I saw these on Amazon, read the reviews, and figured they were so inexpensive, I had little to lose, but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much. When they arrived, I inserted the batteries &amp; tried them. I could hear clearly! They didn&rsquo;t amplify the bass end so much as they did clarify the high end. Even with the TV volume low, I can hear it quite well. My wife was surprised that even with the TV so low, I could hear it. Once you get used to these, setting the volume is super easy. You can leave them in and adjust the small volume control up or down; there&rsquo;s a small &lsquo;beep&rsquo; that signals each increment. I brought them to an appointment with my audiologist (I didn&rsquo;t tell her how much they cost). She said they were good quality. These are excellent. Bottom line: If you can&rsquo;t afford the high end hearing aid and have moderate - severe hearing loss, these will help. The only drawback is the size. They&rsquo;re a little big, but I don&rsquo;t care what other people think. What&rsquo;s important is that with these, I can hear again!</p>
