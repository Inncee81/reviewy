</ul>

<p>Cook breakfast, lunch and dinner on the legendary durability of a Coleman Triton Series InstaStart 2-Burner Stove. The InstaStart push-button matchless lighting system makes ignition easy. Once this propane camping stove starts to heat up, PerfectHeat Technology gets the temperatures just right, WindBlock Shields keep the wind from blowing the flames around and the PerfectFlow Pressure Control System keeps the heat steady on each of the high-performance 11,000-BTU burners. The spacious cooking surface is large enough to fit a 10-in. (25.4 cm) pan and 12-in. (30.48 cm) pan at the same time, and independently-adjustable controls allow you to set your heat anywhere from simmer to boil. The two burner camp stove is also efficient, with a 1-hr. runtime on high using a single 16.4-oz. propane cylinder. When the fun is done, removable heavy-duty, nickel-chrome grates make cleaning easy, and the built-in handle will have you carrying this lightweight stove effortlessly.</p>

<h5 id="vintage-camper-fourth-coleman-stove-comparisons-of-models">Vintage camper, fourth Coleman stove- comparisons of models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my fourth Coleman stove, and the best. My mom had a heavy vintage 1970s coleman, a true work horse, but hard to clean.Then I had the one burner, balance the pot on the top for backpacking, years of service, but a challenge in the wind, and I was sure it would topple over. It never did.Last week I ordered the Coleman 3000001224 Propane 2 Burner Stove, I opened the box, checked it out and returned it, the lid does not go flat, so the burners cannot be used for a pasta or crab pot. also it did not lock. it felt cheap and light and modern.I took my new triton camping last night, and its a wonderful improvement on the basic Coleman stove.Pros, strong feeling without being heavy.the ignition is wonderful in damp Oregon. It so easy to start and restart the stove.the burner lifts off for cleaning.the lid can be laid flat for a crab pot.the stove has enough room under the grate to store the extension tubing to the 2 lb tank I use.(it takes a little wiggling, and I am careful to stay away from the ignition plugs. )it has a lock.my coglan griddle fits perfectly, it heats up in two mins, this stove is a bad boy for fajitas and stir fry.It also simmered very well.the wind blocks are adjustable, unlike a few other stoves.only con, I can see is the lock is a bit light, it could be heavier.it took a couple of tries to get the extension parts to the small propane tank to connect, I just had to rework it slowly. the first arm needs to end up pointed backward, with the tank about 4 feet back.oh when the stove is hot, if you lose a burner and need to relight, you must have a hot pad to protect your hand when you push the button..This is a wonderful stove,I am very happy I made the upgrade here in the damp NW.end of the summer update&mdash; I gave up witht he tubing and tank, it just did not work reliable. I just buy the 1 lb cans, they last a long weekend.the coglin griddle did warp, but I used it so hard! and dishwashed it.the stove will last years, its a grreat buy.</p>

<h5 id="is-this-a-good-stove-depends-on-your-use-summary-in-review">Is This a Good Stove? Depends on Your Use&hellip;summary in review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, it pains me greatly to give a Coleman product anything less than a 4-5 star review. Typically they make very good gear, but this may be one of the exceptions.Some Misconceptions:• The actual size of the stove is about 20-<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; long 12-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; wide (with knobs, body only 12&rdquo;) and 4&rdquo; deep. Amazon lists the size of the packaging.• It weighs a little less than 10 pounds, including the regulator• The box clearly states this was made in China (that may help answer a lot).The Pros:• The design is sleek and modern with the carry handle integrated into the bottom.• The black and silver color scheme is nice, not the standard green.• Many of the internals of the stove have been simplified, therefore making it lighter weight.• It is easy to setup and the 11,000 BTU burners put out the heat.• The adjustable wind block shields really do work.The Cons:• The ignitor is poor. As with other customers, mine did not work at all. It is an aftermarket product such as you would find in a propane grill with a side burner. Also it extends about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; past the stove body. Being plastic, I can see this getting damaged in time.• The knobs stick out about 1&rdquo; (one inch) past the body of the stove. (because they are mounted in somewhat of a recessed area of the stove body, the extension past the body of the stove is only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; or so.• The knobs are plastic and come off VERY easily. I can see them getting damaged and lost over time.• While the knobs have 2-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> turns of control, only about the first <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> turn varies the flame. The remaining appears to be fully open.• The overall build of the unit feels cheap and tinny.• Quality control is a problem, mine arrived in a pristine shipping box, but the unit had scratches. Actually, it will get scratched with use, so this was of minor consequence to me.• There are 2 hinges on the back, not the sturdier piano hinge. Also, the latch is narrow and feels to be of low quality (mine doesn&rsquo;t align well).• If you have a bad spill and need to disassemble the unit, better have snap ring pliers in your camping tool kit, that is what holds the top and bottom together.Suggestions:If you are a serious camper, keep looking, this won&rsquo;t hold up.If you are accustomed to the durability of the older Coleman stoves, you will be disappointed.If this is a backup or emergency stove for rare or occasional use, maybeIf you do car camping and the stove is cared for and used by an adult, maybe.My suggestion is to read a lot and comparison shop, all camping stoves are not equal.Look at the Classic Stove. It is roughly half the price, has many of the features i listed as pro. Read the reviews and buy a box of waterproof light-anywhere matches and keep them nearby.Or, look at more expensive Coleman stoves other brands.Either way, it is backed by the famous Coleman Customer Service folks, so it may be worth the gamble.</p>

<h5 id="a-reliable-and-simple-unit-just-keep-those-burners-screwed-tight">A reliable and simple unit, just keep those burners screwed tight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, and built simple so its easy to use when you want to be focused on having fun at your campsite. At full blast it&rsquo;ll boil a pot of water in about 2 minutes and the wind guards work reasonably well as long as you position the lid to the wind and aren&rsquo;t getting blasted with gale force winds. Big enough to fit two 1.6L MSR pots side by side with some room to spare. Fits perfectly with extra space inside Coleman&rsquo;s Medium Stove Carrying Case.IF YOU&rsquo;RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE IGNITION NOT SPARKING upon initial assembly, please be sure to pull the grate off and tightly screw down each burner (the part with the holes in it that the flames come out of). Out of the box, I could not get spark on my left burner and found out that burner wasn&rsquo;t screwed down tightly. If they aren&rsquo;t tight, the electrical connection won&rsquo;t ground properly and you&rsquo;ll either get a weak/inconsistent spark, or none at all. With both burners tight, the igniter will spark great and light the burner on the first push of the button.</p>

<h5 id="loved-the-convenience">Loved the convenience!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We loved using this camp stove with our family of five while car/tent camping. It&rsquo;s great for heating food and drinks up quickly when the campfire isn&rsquo;t quite going yet. It&rsquo;s very portable and fit on one of the surfaces of our Cabela&rsquo;s Camp Kitchen perfectly. It would be fine on a folding table, picnic table, or milk crate on the ground too. It advertises a carrying handle but it&rsquo;s really more of a molded in groove to grab&hellip; That would be my only complaint, it is still easily carried though. It works great, easy to set up and fold down, super convenient and reasonably priced for the value. One small Coleman propane tank lasted us more than a weekend and we used it a couple times a day for a family of five making toast, pancakes, bacon, and heating up the precooked ground beef we brought for lunch taco bags. I&rsquo;m a primitive camper at heart but this stove was so great for camping with the kiddos.</p>
