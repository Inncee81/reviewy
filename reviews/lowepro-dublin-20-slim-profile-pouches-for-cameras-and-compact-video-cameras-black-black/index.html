<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="beware-of-the-actual-size">Beware of the actual size&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this pouch for my Nikon P7000, which dimensions are 3.125W x 1.75D x 4.5H.Since the LowePro website shows the internal dimensions as 3.5W X 1.8D X 5.1H in, I figured the camera should fit&hellip;Wrong!The pouch is too small. The actual internal dimensions are 3.25W x 1.0D x 4.5H,OK, so it&rsquo;s neoprene so it should stretch. But to stretch the pouch to the camera size puts a lot of stress on the camera, so much so that I worry that I might damage the camera.And it takes about 10 seconds to insert the camera from all of the stretching you have to do, not what you would want for a camera pouch.When I removed it from the pouch, it was so tight that I almost inadvertently flung it across the room trying to pull the camera out of the pouch. I am not sure if the pouch would loosen up a bit with age or not.I did contact LowePro about this, since the price I paid was not enough to cover return shipping. They gave me a prompt reply - within a few minutes, and were gracious enough to make it right. While I might have been disappointed in the product, their customer service was outstanding.So 1 star for the product and 5 stars for LowePro&rsquo;s customer service.</p>

<h5 id="good-bag-bad-sizing-info">Good bag, bad sizing info</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a velcro closure pouch for my P&amp;S camera and this one, according to the specs, looked like a perfect fit. The bag itself is nicely made, sturdy and, for another camera, a good pouch.However, this thing isn&rsquo;t even close to the dimensions they say it is. They claim it is 4.7&rdquo; tall (internal height). It&rsquo;s 4.125; 4.25 if stretched. My camera is 4.4&rdquo; and the flap barely closes with the hooks on the flap just barely able to grab the loops on the case. They claim it is 3.5&rdquo; wide (internal) but at best, it&rsquo;s 2.75&rdquo; My camera is 2.5&rdquo; and, width-wise, fits in there very snugly. They claim it is 1.3&rdquo; deep (internal) but at best it&rsquo;s 1.1&rdquo;. My camera is 1.1&rdquo; and, again, it is very snug. I can barely get the camera out of the pouch and with mountain bike gloves on, it would be a real struggle to get it out in time to capture an image.</p>

<h5 id="i-use-it-for-my-cell-phone-and-like-it">I use it for my cell phone and like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use it for my cell phone (Samsung Avant). I picked this holster after the &ldquo;magnetic latch&rdquo; belt holster for my phone flipped upside down and dropped my phone on the concrete while getting out of the car. It is slightly short for the phone and won&rsquo;t fit a taller phone. Only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the Velcro engages on the flap. It would be nice if it was a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch taller..The belt loop is good and has enough friction that the phone stays on my belt when the belt is unhooked. So no disinfecting the holster/phone off after it falls in the B-room. ( Too much information, but necessary. ).The only down side is when the phone is set to silent / vibrate ( movie / meeting etc.), you have to hear the &ldquo;Riiiip&rdquo; of the velcro when checking the phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lowepro-is-always-great-stuff">Lowepro is always great stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lowepro is always great stuff; very well made and well engineered. I probably have 12 of their various products and they are always the first bag company I turn to when I need a new bag/case for something.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="smaller-than-described">Smaller than described</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lowepro Dublin camera case comes in 3 sizes, identified as 10, 20 and 30. The Lowepro web page gives the interior dimensions of the Dublin 20 case as 3.5&rdquo;W x 1.3&rdquo;D x 4.7&rdquo;H and recommends it for my Sony Cybershot DSC-HX7V camera, which measures 2.2&rdquo;W x 1.1&rdquo;D x 4.0&rdquo;H, which includes a fairly large hand grip. These case dimensions are a little smaller than shown on Amazon.com, but still large enough for my camera, so I ordered it. Unfortunately, the Lowepro and Amazon web pages are both wrong! The Dublin 20 case interior dimensions are actually only 2.8&rdquo;W x 0.9&rdquo;D x 3.9&rdquo;H. And the opening at the top of the case is even more restrictive, 2.4&rdquo;W x 0.7&rdquo;D. The opening is elastic, so my camera did fit into the case, but the fit was snug and it took some effort to get it in and out. But the case was too short to stuff the camera&rsquo;s wrist strap into the top of the case above the camera and then close the flap. If I let the wrist strap dangle outside the case, it would close. But the dangling strap might get caught on something. Therefore, I returned the Dublin 20 case and ordered the similar but larger Dublin 30 case. Amazon paid the return postage because I selected &ldquo;not as described&rdquo; as the reason for the return.The Dublin 30 case is also smaller than its claimed dimensions. The Lowepro web page shows 3.5&rdquo;W x 1.8&rdquo;D x 5.1&rdquo;H, but I measured only 3.5&rdquo;W x 1.1&rdquo;D x 4.5&rdquo;H. The elastic opening at the top of the case is only 2.8&rdquo;W x 0.9&rdquo;D. The Dublin 30 is large enough for my Sony DSC-HX7V, but too small for larger cameras recommended on the Lowepro web page, like the Canon G11/G12.Other reviewers have reported that the Lowepro web page recommended the wrong case for their cameras, too. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that Lowepro doesn&rsquo;t know the dimensions of their own products! This detracts from the quality of their products and probably causes lost sales and unhappy customers, not to mention extra handling costs for online retailers.Setting aside the inaccurate dimensions, the Lowepro Dublin in either size is a very good camera case, so I gave it 4 stars. It&rsquo;s well made and sturdy, with a wide belt loop that is securely attached to the back of the case. The Velcro flap (aka &ldquo;hook and loop&rdquo;) is convenient to open and close, but of course it provides less protection from dust and rain than a zipper closure. There is some padding inside the case, but very little, so it might not protect your camera from rough handling. There&rsquo;s a small pocket under the flap for a spare memory card. I haven&rsquo;t used this, but the pocket is snug, so I suspect it would be difficult to get the card out. The pocket is too small for spare battery.I would recommend the Lowepro Dublin case if it fits your camera and you&rsquo;re looking for the convenience of a Velcro flap closure.</p>

<h5 id="fits-my-phone">Fits my phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the only case large enough for a lot of larger phones. I just wish they made it about an inch taller. This is also getting harder to find.</p>

<p>Fits my Canon Power Shot perfectly!</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-reasonably-priced">Very nice; reasonably priced</h5>

<p>nice pouch.</p>

<h5 id="small-is-beautiful">Small is beautiful</h5>

<p>I like a small smartphone and this pouch is a perfect fit, shame they are no longer made but understandable given current trends away from small devices.</p>

<h5 id="too-small-for-my-compact-point-shoot">Too small for my compact point &amp; shoot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for Lowepro Dublin 10. Case was well made, with expandable neoprene, and has belt loop. The large outside flap made it a little bulky.</p>

<p>ok</p>

<h5 id="bought-iy-yo-carry-my-insulin-pump">Bought iy yo carry my insulin pump</h5>

<p>This is a little small for my insulin pump, It&rsquo;s tight getting it in and out.Lowepro Dublin 10 works better for my Animas Ping.</p>

<h5 id="almost-but-no-cigar">Almost, but no cigar.</h5>

<p>I bought this for my Sony RX 100 II. For me the elastic opening was too tight for easy in and out, which I found frustrating.</p>

<p>My Sont DSC-RX100M3 fits to this case. Inside the case was made with soft material. I also bought the Digpro Ultra-Compact Digital Camera Deluxe Carrying Case - DP15 which fits&hellip;</p>
