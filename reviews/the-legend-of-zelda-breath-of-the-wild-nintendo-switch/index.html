<h5 id="one-of-the-best-games-ever-made">One Of The Best Games Ever Made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To be blunt, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is arguably the best Zelda game ever made and it&rsquo;s definitely the most ambitious. Nintendo has outdone themselves, you have to hand it to them. There is very little negative to say about this game. Let&rsquo;s do a break down of the pros and cons.Pros:+Best Zelda story to date. Yes, it may be the same premise, but there is much more depth this time around. There are other things going on, not just Link rescuing Zelda. All of the side quests add so much to the main story. The depth is what makes the game succeed.+Voice acting adds a lot to some of the characters we already know and love, including Zelda herself. It makes for a richer and more interesting story.+Gameplay is king in Zelda games. We all know this. BOTW is no different. There is a ton of gameplay variety, more than there has ever been. Everything from fighting, exploring, cooking, transportation, it&rsquo;s all been either improved or newly introduced.+Open World and Exploration are front and center in BOTW. The open world design allows you take whatever path you choose. While most Zelda games in the past were linear, this is not the same. Whatever approach you prefer is completely fine. The freedom really shines through in BOTW.+The beautiful art style makes up for anything lacking in the graphics department. The Wii U and Switch are not on par with the PS4 and Xbox One, so don&rsquo;t expect that type of beauty, but the art style truly does make a big difference. Nintendo has always been king when it comes to gorgeous art and design. Exploration is one of the game&rsquo;s biggest draws. Conquering the 100+ shrines is amazing!+Wii U and Switch versions offer choice for the gamer. You don&rsquo;t have to upgrade to the Switch to experience BOTW. The Wii U version is every bit as great as the Switch one. In fact, I owned the Switch version but got rid of it in favor of the Wii U version. I did not see the point in upgrading since the only other Switch game I care about is Mario Odyssey and that doesn&rsquo;t come out for almost another year.+More than 100 hours of gameplay offers major value (in your wallet) and replay value. There is always something to see and do!+The game world is absolutely huge. This lends itself to many hours of fun, whether you are doing side quests, the main quests, shrines, or goofing off.+Challenging and thought provoking puzzles are a standout in BOTW. Every shrine has a challenging puzzle, while most boss battles require you to solve a puzzle as well.+Cooking is really fun. Doing recipes is a blast, just experimenting with food can be an interesting distraction.+Great A.I., from the main characters, townsfolk and enemies.+Use the Wii U Pro controller for the best experience. It is more tight and comfortable than the GamePad. I don&rsquo;t have experience with the Switch Pro Controller (probably because it&rsquo;s $70!) but I am sure it&rsquo;s superior to the Joy-Cons and Grip.Cons:-Weapons break a lot, maybe too much. I found that a lot of my time was devoted to changing weapons, whether in a battle or not. It&rsquo;s not a game-breaker but it is an annoyance.Overall, Zelda BOTW is an all time great. It&rsquo;s a game you must experience and have in your collection. I bought the Wii U version, but the choice is yours. Go out and buy it to experience something you will never forget!</p>

<h5 id="unbelievably-fun-even-for-a-non-gamer">Unbelievably fun, even for a non-gamer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I pre-ordered this game at my boyfriend&rsquo;s insistence when we bought the Switch. I&rsquo;m not a big gamer (I was mostlty looking forward to playing Mario Kart) and I&rsquo;ve never played any of the Zelda games before, so I assumed I would never play this. When the console arrived, this was the only game we had for it because our other pre-ordered games haven&rsquo;t been released yet. I decided to give it a try, and after a few days of learning the controls and figuring out the gameplay, I&rsquo;ve become totally obsessed with this game. I played for four hours last night and had to drag myself away when it was time to go to bed.The graphics are phenomenal, the storyline is interesting, and there&rsquo;s so much more to do than I could have imagined. You could entertain yourself for hours just running around exploring and collecting things even if you didn&rsquo;t want to play the actual storyline. I can&rsquo;t recommend this game enough, even for non-gamers and non-Zelda fans.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-got-all-of-the-best-parts-of-a-zelda-game-plus-it-being-open">It&rsquo;s got all of the best parts of a Zelda game plus it being open &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The ability to play it anywhere is incredible. It&rsquo;s got all of the best parts of a Zelda game plus it being open world makes it so you are never bored. I can barely play the main story because I&rsquo;m so distracted by doing other things</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ve-been-converted">I&rsquo;ve been converted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of Zelda games. I liked Wind Waker and that is about it. I far prefer the Final Fantasy games. I only bought this for my wife to play with the console undocked while I play Xbox one on the tv. I decided to try it after watching her&hellip;..this game is FANTASTIC. You can easily spend hours roaming and discovering on top of a fun storyline. There is sooooo much to explore and find. The only reason I stop playing each day is because I have to and not because I want to. This is one of my new favorite games.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-own-a-switch-you-must-get-this-game">If you own a switch, you must get this game!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent, excellent game! My only other LoZ experience was on the NES, and this has my attention just as that did. It&rsquo;s extremely fun, I never want to put it down. And there&rsquo;s so much to do! The side quests aren&rsquo;t boring like most side quests are in RPG&rsquo;s and MMO&rsquo;s, the puzzles are tricky and leave me feeling accomplished when I figure them out, the main story is gradually challenging, the enemies are scaled based on area but even if you run into higher baddies, dispatching them only takes a few more minutes. I&rsquo;ve played countless hours of Elder Scrolls games, and this gives that vibe with a nice LoZ &amp; Nintendo spin. Excellent game, excellent experience.</p>

<h5 id="might-be-the-best-game-ever">Might be the best game ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ive been a gamer all my life. Since the Atari. This game is the experience of a lifetime. Might be the best game ever. Words can&rsquo;t do it justice..Beautiful, immersive, magnificent, epic are all adjectives that come to my head.Forget about virtual reality, this is the most immersive experience you can experience witha video game.I don&rsquo;t recommend you buy it, I COMMAND you to. Go. Now.Masterpiece.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-breath-of-inspiration-the-very-best">A Breath of Inspiration, The Very Best!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not overstate the fact that this is one of the most incredible games I have ever played, and has been a constant source of addiction since I have purchased it.I have never seen a game that offers such rich rewards for exploration, that builds a story one day at a time, one piece at a time, so compellingly. It is a game that makes you think, strategize every action that you take. It is a game that can be so realistic, while allowing players to immerse themselves in its game world. I absolutely love this game, and truthfully it was worth the purchase of the Switch.Buy this game, it is an experience unlike any other.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-must-play-this-game">You must play this game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best Zelda since OoT hands down. A breath of fresh air for the series and really brings it into the modern era of games. Despite it&rsquo;s size its very easy to play in small chunks due to the shrine/quest structure the game has. Beautiful environments and music. Nearly every time I play I discover something new that I didn&rsquo;t know I could do before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="new-to-zelda-or-not-buy-it">New to Zelda or not buy it !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only played the game for about 30 minutes and I was stuck on it the open world is great and the switch makes it even more awesome since it&rsquo;s on the go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-fun-i-ve-had-in-long-long-time">Best fun I&rsquo;ve had in long, long time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I never was much a fan of Zelda 3D games in the past. I usually prefer 2D games such as A Link to the Past and the newer game, A Link Between Worlds, which were fantastic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>
