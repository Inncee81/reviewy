<h5 id="good-cable-sleeve-but-not-exactly-the-best">Good cable sleeve but not exactly the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The PRO&rsquo;s:- The product looks nice, black is obviously a good color to make them, not question about that.- The product feels nice, you would think it would attract hair if you have pets but I have cats and dogs in and out of my room and so far they look very nice and have little to no hair attached to them, a big plus to me.- It comes with 4 sleeves (depending on the variant you purchase) which is an adequate amount, I don&rsquo;t see myself needing any more than that honestly. As of now I have 2 of the sleeves running up my desk for my computer peripherals (mouse, keyboard, HDMI, DVI, audio cables, etc.) and the other 2 sleeves are covering the cables that run to my sub-woofer (that being the cables for the 2 desktop units that run to it as well as power cable)- Potentially protects the cables from heat somewhat. Now Iâ€™m not sure if there&rsquo;s any science behind this, it simply gives me peace of mind that all the cables I believe are protected in this sleeve as all my cables run near the radiator- High quality zipper, I have yanked and pulled these so hard to stretch around my cables I swear I thought that the cables would burst right out of the zipper but it holds up surprisingly well.That&rsquo;s about it for the pro&rsquo;s, I mean it&rsquo;s a cable sleeve, what more is there to sayThe CON&rsquo;S:- The sleeves in my opinion are a bit small, I wish they were bigger to accommodate for all my cables. They could either offer it as a separate option or just implement it throughout the product line. Either way, zipping these up is ridiculously hard. All I&rsquo;m going to say is there&rsquo;s not much wiggle room, they really don&rsquo;t stretch as much as you would think.- Unlike a lot of cable management sleeves out there you cannot branch off any of the cables unless you did something like cut a hole in them but I don&rsquo;t believe JOTO would want you doing that and if they have a warranty that would most likely void it. Not a problem so much for me but if you&rsquo;re looking to do that, please find a different cable management sleeve as this will not cut it for you- Miss aligned zippers, that&rsquo;s all that really needs to be said but I&rsquo;ll go on because it just annoys me. If you&rsquo;re looking to zip it all the way up, good luck, for all of my cable sleeves they don&rsquo;t line up properly. Doesn&rsquo;t really mess it up, doesn&rsquo;t even look that bad as it&rsquo;s just a cable sleeve but close up it just annoys me. Either the left or right side of the zipper will stick out a bit, and I&rsquo;ve chosen to accept that.- Wish they added more lengths, 40&rdquo; is a bit too big for me, and 19&rdquo; is a bit too small. Now I know they can&rsquo;t cater to my needs, they go with the majority and I guess that&rsquo;s what the majority has but a few more options would have been a welcome addition.- Taking these off are a PAIN, honestly the most annoying part. I had to route a usb extender for my new usb hub and it took maybe a half an hour no lie at all to get it right. Once the cables are in there you will NOT get any leeway, the cables are in there for good (at least with my arrangement of a million cables in one sleeve) so you have to mess around with it until it&rsquo;s just right and then zip them both up hoping to god you have not messed anything up. In the end it looks very nice and neat, but what a pain to get it that way. It seems the zipper never wants to zip up, it&rsquo;s just a hair too high to be zipped up and you have to start all over again.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;In the end it&rsquo;s a cable sleeve, nothing more, nothing less. However, it&rsquo;s not the perfect god given gift of a cable sleeve as some reviewers would have you believe. That&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not a good cable sleeve, it&rsquo;s a damn good one, and it looks professional. You could go and get those ones that look like a snake or whatever made of plastic and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re better, but do you really want that thing hanging from your desk? However, I&rsquo;m not here to try and trick you into buying this product, it&rsquo;s the one I bought because I was on a time constraint. If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re probably not as it&rsquo;s extremely long by now, longer than I wanted it to be. Please refer now to the pictures I have posted regarding this product, I&rsquo;m sure they will help you out if you can see what they look like. Sorry I do not have any before pictures, and I&rsquo;m not going to take apart my cables just to show them, it&rsquo;s hard enough to get them into the sleeve. I hope I&rsquo;ve helped and if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment and I&rsquo;ll try and get back to you to help you out.</p>

<h5 id="very-worth-it">Very Worth It!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were EXTREMELY useful to me, I like them a lot. Cheap and more than I&rsquo;ll need for a long time. I have a very busy workspace at home, with two monitors and a tablet and big keyboard, speakers, NAS drive, ect, and it was very cluttered. But with these and also a few other products, I managed to clean it up A TON. Now it looks much nicer, is much cleaner, and safer. Definitely would recommend getting these if you have a bunch of stray cables hanging around your desk area and such. After I zip tied all of my big bundles of cables and adapters and such together and up and down the desk, I wrap these around the bundles for a nice, clean&hellip;less hazardous look :DÂ 1.5&rdquo; Adhesive Backed Mounting Bases with 8&rdquo; Cable Ties - BlackCable Management Sleeve, JOTO Cord Management System for TV / Computer / Home Entertainment, 19 - 20 inch Flexible Cable Sleeve Wrap Cover Organizer, 4 Piece - BlackBelkin BE112230-08 12-Outlet Surge Protector</p>

<h5 id="the-best-cable-management-i-ever-had">The Best Cable Management I Ever Had!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried so many cable managers that ended up letting me down. Either they weren&rsquo;t big enough to hid all my cables or poorly constructed. This product was really easy to use. The sleeves doesn&rsquo;t feel or look cheap and the zipper isn&rsquo;t difficult to zip. The process is almost like making a burrito. I simply put my cables in the middle of the sleeve then rolled the sleeve and zipped it up like a jacket. Now my O.C.D. is at peace! Great product!</p>

<h5 id="better-than-cable-straps-and-plastic-sleeves-i-love-them">Better than cable straps and plastic sleeves - I love them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love these cable management sleeves&hellip; more so than the straps I have been using. In the past, I have used those plastic sleeves, but these are much better because they are easier to maneuver around and they just look better. These are easy to wrap around cables and zip up. They hold quite a few cables. I have about 8 cables in each sleeve with a bit of room to spare.I love them!(A sample was provided for testing and an honest evaluation&rsquo;.)</p>

<h5 id="cord-sleeves">cord sleeves</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have cords, you need these. In fact, I will be purchasing more. Easy to use ( I thought it might be a bit tricky)&hellip; so much better blend into the wall than a stark, black cord. I only ordered one pack of the longer set&hellip; I recommend purchasing one of the shorter and 2 of the longer set (only 2 per pack of the longer set), depending on how many cords you have to hide. I chose the ivory color which is a bit yellow.. but that worked for my walls. They are sort of a foamy feel&hellip; cushioning the cords and lots of stretch for quite a few cords in one sleeve. LOVE these. End the tangled, knotted mess. I will, of course, update my review should new info be useful. Further, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.</p>

<h5 id="turned-out-to-be-a-breeze">Turned out to be a breeze!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had order this item in the hopes that it would make my living look less messy and wouldn&rsquo;t be a hassle to get the wires to be to difficult to wrap. Turned out to be a breeze! I really like that it&rsquo;s a zipper and not velcro wrap. These are ideal for area where the cables are not ridiculously too long. They&rsquo;re approximately 19.8 inches. (1.5 ft) .They&rsquo;re great for any area where you just don&rsquo;t want a messy wire&rsquo;s looking too busy. Enjoy!</p>

<h5 id="cable-management-made-easy">cable management made easy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I simply put a twist tie around the cable near the middle of where they were in the sleeve, got the zip going and then once I got the zip in place I removed the tie and zipped it up. I love having a neat and clean look in the back of my TV now. Before it was a jungle, now it is a nearly laid out maze that you can easily find you way out of (corny explanation but its the truth). If you need cable management, get these! Cheap price and tough as nails. I had one left over so I tried to tear and rip off the zip just to see how tough they really were and not a scratch on the thing. Definitely worth the price and the time to install. 5 stars all the way!</p>
