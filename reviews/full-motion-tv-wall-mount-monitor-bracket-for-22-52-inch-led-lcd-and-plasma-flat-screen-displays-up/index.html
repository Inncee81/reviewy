<p>To ensure fit of the mounting pattern, check the VESA pattern for your panel, either online or by measuring between the screw holes on the rear of the TV or panel (100mm is about 4&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-amazingly-on-my-46-samsung-led-lcd-tv">Works amazingly on my 46&rdquo; Samsung LED LCD TV!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 46&rdquo; Samsung LED LCD TV and it has held it up incredibly well and I have no fear at all that it will fall. As other reviewers say, the instructions could be better, but seriously, if you&rsquo;re installing a wall mount yourself, you have to use some common sense. The parts are incredibly strong and just make sure you see which side goes up and which side goes down, as it is crucial to your installation. I would highly recommend this to anyone out there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product">Nice product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty good product and great for the price. I read many reviewers complaining about the instructions, tools and mounting hardware but I didn&rsquo;t use any of these. The most important thing is to insure it is mounted level! It looks like the kits now come with a level so use it!If you do not need the extra brackets to mount the TV they can be used to mount a sound bar if you are savvy.I mounted a sound bar, a DirecTV wireless receiver, a surge protector and hid all the wires on mine using zip ties and small wood screws&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-at-1-3-the-price-of-similar-units-in-our-local-stores">Good product at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the price of similar units in our local stores.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect, but close enough. The TV wall mount came as advertised and thanks to Prime I had in on my doorstep in 2 days. This is a beefy (and heavy) mount. I&rsquo;m sure it weighs more than the 32&rdquo; Samsung that it is now holding up. I had no problems mounting it to the wall&hellip; after I found the wall stud, OK so my 21 year old stud finder was DOA and I was too lazy to drive down the hill to the hardware store to buy a new one; anyway, the extra holes can be puttied over. The included <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; x 3&rdquo; lag bolts are overkill for my TV, or all TVs this mount is rated for. I can&rsquo;t review the Sheetrock anchor system that is included because I screwed into a stud, or the mount extenders as my little Sammy fit the 4 holes in the base plate so didn&rsquo;t need to add the wings. The only &ldquo;bad&rdquo; thing I ran into was the mounting screws that attach the TV to the mounting plate. The included screws were too short to also use the spacers, but were about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; too long to screw directly into the TV. I really don&rsquo;t blame anyone for this and was prepared to drive to the HW store to buy the correct screws, but found that a couple of thick washers on each screw worked so I saved myself a drive. The mount folds nicely and is very stable in all positions. One thing I did that helped me, but I&rsquo;m really not sure if it was worth the extra time was to unbolt the wall base from the arm so I didn&rsquo;t have to hold the whole thing in place while I bolted it to the wall.</p>

<h5 id="great-universal-mount">Great universal mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these mounts for two 32inch Vizio TVs I use as computer monitors in my office and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Now there is more space on my desk plus I can position the monitors how I please, without any hassle. The price was great as well (the price of similar mounts is around 3 times more expensive at the big box retailers) and they are very sturdy and could hold a much larger TV. They were very easy to instal but I would recommend having a friend help and make sure you have a level, a marker and a stud finder as well also, having a drill and an electric screwdriver will make things much easier for you. They instructions are poor, but it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to figure out. I now have every TV in my home mounted to a wall. This mount should work for any brand of led TV up to 46 inches. I think plasmas are heavier so check the weight capacity of the mount and the weight of your TV before ordering.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-even-know-where-to-start">I don&rsquo;t even know where to start!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount was PERRRRRRFECT for my new 50&rdquo; Vizio TV. I could not believe the superior quality for the price. It is extremely sturdy, and was very, very easy to mount to the wall. My 50&rdquo; Vizio only weighs 28 lbs and did not require the extension arms to mount to the TV. It mounted perfectly on the main mount and is very secure. It does allow for a lot of movement of the TV and quite easily. HIGHLY recommend this mount. Instructions aren&rsquo;t the greatest, but really easy to figure out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-built-and-extends-smoothly">Well Built and Extends Smoothly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well made, slides smoothly and extremely strong. I&rsquo;m just holding a 23 inch monitor with it but it does not bend noticably at full extension. The plastic covers fit well but are hard, thin plastic and I don&rsquo;t have much long term confidence in them. Overall though I would totally recommend this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-mount-and-works-great-with-a-samsung-un32j4000af-tv">Easy to mount and works great with a Samsung UN32J4000AF TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to mount, just use a stud finder to locate both sides of a stud for the top hole and the bottom hole, then drill a pilot hole in the center of the stud for each of the 3 mounting holes (bottom, center, top). This is a very heavy/strong TV mount &amp; does have a ~ 5&rdquo; offset from the stud mounting center hole to the center of the TV. But this was fine for me and it holds my Samsung UN32J4000AF TV just great. The Mount Factory TV mount was perfect for the VESA 200x200 (M8) pattern on the back of my TV - I used the four M8 screws that came with the mount; however I did need to go to Lowes to get a bag of M8 washers ( 2 washers were use under the head of each screw to meet the TV mount guidelines). If you are placing this in a corner or near furniture, draw a detailed diagram first to make sure the TV sides/top/bottom have clearance when the TV is moved in its different positions</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="difficult-but-perfect">Difficult but perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It took forever it seems like to put together. And I&rsquo;m so thankful it wasn&rsquo;t just me and my boyfriend that put it up, because there is absolutely no way we would&rsquo;ve been able to do it ourselves without wanting to kill one another. Other than the difficulty, it&rsquo;s exactly what we wanted! We wanted the tv for our play room, and it rotates enough that we can swing it around the corner into the living room so now my boyfriend can watch two football games at once&hellip;.. Men.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-expected">Works as expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as expected. Pay attention to the directions you don&rsquo;t want to put too much weight on this or your wall</p>
