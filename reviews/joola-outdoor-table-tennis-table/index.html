<h5 id="great-table-despite-delivery-hiccup">Great table, despite delivery hiccup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We ordered this table for our son for Christmas. It was very easy to assemble - about 10-15 minutes with 2 people. We have really been enjoying using the table, it is easy to fold/unfold and wheel in and out of the garage. The table is a lot of fun to play and our whole family has really enjoyed it. On the negative side, the first table arrived bent up in several places. We contacted Amazon for a replacement, and the new (undamaged) one arrived today. We were still able to play with the first one, but were concerned that the bent areas would effect play.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-and-price">great quality and price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So easy to assemble. About 20 Minutes. Quality is very good. Be aware that the only thing that keeps the two separate pieces together are the clamps for the net, but they appear to be holding the table together and even just fine. I was afraid that the outdoor material may look like cheap aluminum but it looks high qualityREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="good-so-far-took-a-bit-longer-than-15-minutes-to-set-up">Good so far! Took a bit longer than 15 minutes to set up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have had this table for only a few days, but it has worked out really well. I live in as and wanted something that would resist the heat. The surface is ver durable and seems like it will hold up well. It is relatively easy to set up for one person play. It does take longer to set up than 15 minutes. I am pretty handy, but I think it would take a NASCAR pit crew to get it done in 15 minutes. Probably more like 30-45, so not a big deal. Given the sturdiness of the table, it is heavy. Best to have a helper. The bounce is a bit different than a traditional table. Not a bad thing especially for occasional players or young kids. My kids are 6 and 9 and it seems to work well for them.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="quality-table-for-the-money">Quality table for the money!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>than this table is a must.First let me start by mentioning the box the table came in. Taped all the way around with extra Padding it should not get damages in transport (unless your delivery guy drops it out of the back of his truck). There&rsquo;s additional boards surrounding the body of the table to further protect it during shipping.The main box was smaller than I had anticipated it would be yet the box was deceptively heavy. Although the instructions recommend assembly by two people, and a very careful individual could assemble it by themselves.Opening the main box revealed many unmarked cardboard boxes. They are more than packaging however and contain the hardware required to assemble the table as well as the wheels and the net assembly. Be sure to check each box. I was convinced they had forgotten to place a net within the box until I went back for a second look.The quality of each item is very good, much more so than I had anticipated it would be. I had initially purchased an indoor table, it quickly cancelled that order and ordered this table as the barn this table will be kept in is definitely not temperature controlled. This table appears as though it will provide many years of maintenance free play. Additionally I was excited to see that parts are available for this table should the situation ever arise.Setting each half of the table upright was no problem. It did take a few minutes to figure out how to level each half of the table. Also I feel the instructions explaining the installation of the net into the net holder pieces could have been written out or at least the picture could have been enlarged to a larger then several Wallet size photos.Once assembled the table mobility is second to none and could easily be pushed around the room by even a child.Now for the good stuff, the ball bounce is excellent, although initially I was concerned with an outdoor table that the ball would not bounce.All in all a very excellent purchase.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-easy-to-assemble">great quality - easy to assemble</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product arrived on a big truck - on time and undamaged - got to love Prime with no shipping charge. Assembly was incredibly easy. Some complain about the two piece construction, yet the engineering/design of the table is great and its very easy to level. The net assembly rocks, keeps the net in place and with tension&hellip;..way better than any other ]s we have had. Easy to move, fold up , fold down. Extremely satisfied with this one. Great job Joola.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="we-love-this-table">We love this table</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered as a Christmas gift. Delivery was arranged very easily through amazon. On arrival there was a significant cut in the box however the table was very well packed and this did not matter (we inspected package before accepting).Assembly was a dream. Eight bolts and thats it, then attach the clamps and net. 25 minutes because I was in no particular hurry.the two table halves line up nicely and clamp together well. There is a slight sag in the middle where the tables line up (like 2-3mm) and its in the middle only. Seems this is unavoidable as there is no support for the two halves there.Table folds and rolls nicely. Easy to operate.Table is a big hit with the adults and kids. Blue surface is a nice change from our old green table from my youth. Surface plays very well to us amateurs. This will be in the basement during the winter and then get some time outdoors during the summer.Pleased with purchase.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="solid-table-assembly-alone-worth-the-price">Solid table, assembly alone worth the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid table all around. It is an outdoor, so the bounce is different than wood, but I haven&rsquo;t noticed any significant dead spots as others have mentioned. The net so far seems to be taught and looks like it will hold up. The clamps and how the table sits together are a bit weak for my liking, our concrete is slightly uneven for drainage and there isn&rsquo;t much built in for leveling, especially in the middle, but I will likely add my own clamps. What is outstanding for this table is the assembly. With as much as I&rsquo;ve assembled in my life, this table was almost completely built. Popped open the legs, bolted on the wheel legs with 2 easy bolts per leg, clamped on the net and was done. 15 minutes at most to playing, if not less. Overall a very solid table and would purchase again.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="excellent-design-i-like-that-the-two-pieces-can">Excellent design. I like that the two pieces can &hellip;</h5>

<p>Excellent design. I like that the two pieces can be completely separated which makes moving and storage a lot easier. The bounce feels similar to regular indoor tables.</p>

<p>I like the table a lot. It is very easy to set up, however I did have a few issues with delivery. It took 3 delivery attempts to finally get one that was suitable.</p>
