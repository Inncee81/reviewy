<h5 id="these-are-great-and-actually-better-quality-than-i-expected">These are great and actually better quality than I expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great and actually better quality than I expected. &hellip;very nice metal finish with no sharp or jagged edges.There are 12 pieces, more than other seller as same price.The eyehole can accommodate 7-strand paracord. However, the clip part is actually a little too small to hook the same piece of 7-strand cord and close the latch. It&rsquo;s doable, but it takes effort and it&rsquo;s definitely not quick release. Forget hooking anything larger than that. It does work great in that regard when hooking 275 (5 strand) paracord. So I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re really made for use with 5 strand cord or smaller. Luckily that&rsquo;s exactly what I had in mind when I bought them.They came quickly (prime) in excellent condition and as described, so I have no reason not to give these 5 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="then-you-have-come-across-one-of-the-better-ones-around">then you have come across one of the better ones around</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are looking for a small carabineer to organize items, then you have come across one of the better ones around. Now these are not built for anything heavy duty for heavy lifting. They are prefect for keys simply because they are of a small design which in most cases you will not need a key ring but you can still use one. I did have a couple lock box keys that had a smaller hole but ten seconds on my drill press solved that issue. SO look at your keys and you will note a uniform size of the holes for the most part and my set of 6CM carabineers would fit through those key holes. Please do not limit the use of these guys to just keys for I have one on my vacuum water bottle. I also use a couple to secure my tool kit to my bicycle and they work better than the larger ones I had in place (pulled in tighter for a better fit or more secure binding). The best part I get to retrieve some of my more expensive units from light duty because my girlfriend has ideas. My neighbor has a small dog and has problems with the leash spring clip. I used one of these as a replacement for the original leash or collar clip. It works great for her and has helped to overcome one of the arthritic challenges in her life. Now I would not recommend for a larger dog that has high energy levels. This is a great deal for small projects or applications and I will give a five star just because of the light duty design.</p>

<h5 id="really-a-great-accessory-and-backup-carabiner">Really a great accessory and backup carabiner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really a great accessory and backup carabiner. These are great and actually better quality than I expected. &hellip;very nice metal finish with no sharp or jagged edges. They are very small. The throat opens just enough for 550 cord to enter the gate. Also the eye hole is just big enough to pass the 550 cord. All but the slimiest of flame whipped ends will not pass through. I ended up having to cut the melted end off one project to get the cord through the eye. &hellip;not a big deal but you may want to plan for it. I can&rsquo;t see using them a a lot but they are very cool if they are what you need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="durable-useful-spring-loaded-connectors">Durable, useful spring loaded connectors.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Ontrip carabiner are small but rugged enough for sure. I run paracord through them and use the to secure gear to my pack or roof basket of my car. They work well and make things very quick and convenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-stars-awesome-little-guys">5 Stars. Awesome little guys.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered a pack (12pcs), I am pretty happy with these items.I was looking for some small wiregate clips for a project and this seemed to fit the bill. These are very small, but durable and well made. I use these on hammock setups, they work well to attach my underquilt and hang my tarp from the continuous ridgeline. I also use them to hang things like a pouch off of a ZingIt Ridgeline inside my hammock bugnet, the size of these is ideal for ZingIt line. Hammock people will know what I&rsquo;m talking about in these comments. So far so good.In addition to using this product while camping for tie-downs (it&rsquo;s perfect), it is also great as a car key quick disconnect when leaving your car for valet parking or auto repairs; or the reverse: when going to a social event, you can keep your auto key or remote and lock your other bulky keys in your car. Not rated for life line in climbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-size-for-clipping-items-to-backpacks">Nice size for clipping items to backpacks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These clips are a good size for clipping items to backpacks and to use as key chains.I will be using these around the house. They will work well for outdoor string lights and for hanging bird feeders and lightweight plants along our patio. I have some smaller ones that I use for the hummingbird feeders, these will work great for the heavier feeders I have. They look so much nicer than the larger carabiners I had been using since they aren&rsquo;t as visible yet they are still strong enough to work very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-organizing-keys">Great for organizing keys</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have so many keys, some keys for work, some keys for all of my relatives houses, both cars. I can able to organize my keys with this so I can only take the set that we actually needs. The clasp feels nice and strong. They look sleek in all black. There are plenty of uses to find for these. I have also used one of these clips to hang some art from in a craft show.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-these-are-the-smallest">very good! These are the smallest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very good! These are the smallest, highest quality Climbing Carabiners on the market. I love them. The only thing that would make them better is if they put a keylock style gate on there so it doesn&rsquo;t snag. But since I use mine mostly for non-climbing purposes, that is not a huge issue. They are super multi-functional and I use them for things like clipping my water bottle, clipping my climbing shoes, keychain, etc. Not sure how I would like the small size for climbing. Probably good for a 9-10mm rope.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-i-am-glad-i-purchased-the-set-of-12">so I am glad I purchased the set of 12</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These mini carabiners worked perfectly for holding down of a bunch of pieces. I keep finding more uses for them, so I am glad I purchased the set of 12.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-stars">5 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quite a bit smaller then I expected, I mean they work and they aren&rsquo;t bad I just expected them to be larger, these are small tho and don&rsquo;t open far so your kinda limited on what&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-little-clips">Good little clips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good little clips. Very tiny (which is what I was after) and fairly sturdy. Pay attention to the size you are ordering or you may be disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these to hold ski passes to our jacket. Depending on conditions we each have 2 different jackets.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="paracord-accessory">Paracord accessory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good solid joins, excellent for my paracord projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used these to make my keychain more modular. Handy little things. Good quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-great-for-my-need">Work great for my need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you need I recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="useful-for-me">Useful for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I paid full price. I never get free stuff. The below thoughts and opinions are my own and not influenced. Sorry had to add that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-work-great-for-that">They work great for that!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a repeat order. I restore vintage machinist&rsquo;s tool chest and use these clips and rings to tether the keys to the chests.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-satisfied-with">Very satisfied with</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received more than enough for the purpose I wanted plus a bonus of a split ringfor each D clip. These are NOT meant for hanging heavy objects or climbing.</p>
