Product Description
KitchenAid Artisan Series Refurbished 5 Qt. Tilt Head Stand Mixer model has a 325-watt motor, stainless steel bowl with comfort handle and a tilt-head mixer design that provides easy access to bowl and beaters. Burnished or coated beater included with purchase dependent on availability.</p>

<p>Amazon.com
KitchenAid&rsquo;s Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child&rsquo;s play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. The bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman&rsquo;s bowling ball, this stand mixer isn&rsquo;t the sort of appliance you&rsquo;ll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged&ndash;you&rsquo;ll want to show it off. &ndash;Betsy Danheim</p>

<p>Editor&rsquo;s note: This is a reconditioned small appliance. Reconditioned generally means that the appliance has been returned to the manufacturer, who brings the appliance back to like-new condition. Some appliances may contain cosmetic blemishes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Definitely worth buying refurbished. Bought ours about 5 mos ago. Came with a slight crack in the base but it is purely cosmetic and not noticeable at all unless you are looking for it. Operates perfectly for cookies, breads, whipped cream, etc. hoping to buy some attachments soon!</p>

<h5 id="poor-quality">Poor quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>1st use on small batch of dough resulted in base stripped kitchen aid shipped another, back ordered so obviously a current issue</p>

<p>The mixer I had before was ok. It did the job, until the electronic controls broke and the speed was kind of random.This mixer on the other hand is vastly superior than my previous Oster stand mixer, or my moms old Sunbeam (but she can&rsquo;t complain, she used it for 50 years).The biggest pros are the sturdiness and power of this mixer. It is also quiet and can do any job without lamentations.The standard stailess bowl is a plus too. I no longer have to worry about breaking it like I had with the old glass bowls. The 5.5 qt. bowl is a good size for me. I don&rsquo;t think I have any recipe that would exceed its capacity. Its smaller cousing may be too limited for weekend baker.The attachments are also easy to clean, and will probably never rust. My old attachments rusted a bit near the rivets because, I often will just let the dishes to dry in the dish rack. This is no longer a worry.If you think that you need the special chute to avoid messes, think again. This accessory is not at all needed. The refurb. model that I purchased did not have it. I had reservations about this when I placed my order, but after using the mixer, I soon realized that not only did I not need it, but it is probably a nuisance.This device greatest quality, sturdiness, is also the cause of its greatest defect; it is heavy. A frail person would not be able to handle it. This is not the kind of device that you can easily store in the cubboards. It is much better if you can devote counter space for it.I still have an unresolved question? Basically kitchen aid has two basic designs: one where the top part of the mixer pivots (my mixer) and one where the bowl goes up and down. I still wonder if one design is superior? I think that should be your only question when buying a kitchen aid mixer.I hope you enjoy this product as much as I did.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-5-years-now">Great for 5 Years now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had bought this mixer for one purpose only. Making cookies. I&rsquo;ve found that for close to a hundred batches that I&rsquo;ve made this mixer has worked flawlessly. I had burned out several mixers with some of the doughs that I made. So I finally bought the KitchenAid brand. This has ended up saving money for me. It is a factory reconditioned, but like I said in the title I&rsquo;ve owned it for for 5 years now and am extremely satisfied.My issue is that the pictures should accurately reflect what you are receiving not what you could get if you buy accessories. The description does accurately tell you what you recieve with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="clarifications">Clarifications</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A couple of clarifications:First, if you&rsquo;re curious about the color, it is white. Under product details, look at the Item model number: RRK150WH. The last two letters there indicate the color. Check out the page for the brand new Artisan Mixers if you don&rsquo;t take my word for it&ndash;when you select different colors, the last two letters change to indicate what color it is. So if you&rsquo;re considering buying this, don&rsquo;t be worried that you&rsquo;ll end up with an orange or purple mixer.Secondly, I ordered this as a surprise gift, which I have to assume is fairly common. As a warning if you&rsquo;re doing this, it comes in a white box with green print all over it showing a picture of the mixer, the KitchenAid logo, and all sorts of other writing indicative of what&rsquo;s inside. Thankfully, I intercepted it at the door and was able to hide it to maintain the surprise.Other than that, it looks and feels brand new&ndash;no cosmetic blemishes and it is exactly like I expected. The reconditioned Artisan is the best value I could find (though KitchenAid does sell the reconditioned in a bunch of other colors if you call them. I think they quoted me about $20 more than this list price, including their shipping charge).</p>

<p>This is my second Kitchen Aid mixer. The first worked fine except I couldn&rsquo;t turn it off. I gave it to a young family who the husband is an electrician and he fixed it. They are happy with it. It was a smaller version of the one I just bought. I love the new color, but most of all I love the larger size. I was in a pickle since when the old one went capo I was in the middle of making a wedding cake. I need a mixer I could count on to use for making the icing. The quick service and was greatly appreciated. As a matter of fact I bought two of them. The second one is sitting in my closet and will be given to my daughter for her birthday the end of the month. It was a mistake in my ordering but when I realized it the second mixer was already sent so I decided it would save me a shopping trip&hellip; I know my daughter will love it. So will her husband as he is the one who does most the cooking.</p>

<p>Be sure to inspect your mixture. We didn’t look at it until 2 months later. And out of the box it came with scratches, dings and noticeable touch up paint.</p>
