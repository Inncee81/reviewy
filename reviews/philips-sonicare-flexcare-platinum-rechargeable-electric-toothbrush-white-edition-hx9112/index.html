<h5 id="great-toothbrush-but-not-a-significant-improvement-on-sonicare-s-much-cheaper-models">Great toothbrush, but not a significant improvement on Sonicare&rsquo;s much cheaper models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no question that Sonicare makes great toothbrushes. Each of my last three dentists recommends them, and I’ve been using one for more than ten years. However, I get the feeling their differentiation between models is more about incremental profit than a better clean.My wife recently upgraded to the Sonicare Flexcare Platinum having previously used an entry-level Sonicare. Her verdict – no noticeable difference. And, even Sonicare’s product descriptions bear that out. This brush delivers the same 31,000 strokes per minute as the cheapest Sonicare, but is (currently) selling at more than three times the price.The supposed differentiators this model includes:- The pressure sensor – actually a unique feature that Sonicare’s cheaper brushes do not offer, but you’ll have to decide for yourself whether you’re so concerned that you’re pressing too hard that you’ll pay this much more (seems like the amount of wear on your toothbrush head could provide similar information)- Three different brushing modes – according to the user manual these modes just adjust the timer (i.e., if you want to get the White mode from your entry-level Sonicare, just run it for an extra 30 seconds).- Three intensity settings – available in all but Sonicare’s very cheapest model- Quadpacer – (a great feature but) also available in all but Sonicare’s cheapest model- Brush heads – interchangeable, so you should not base your brush decision on which heads are includedDo I recommend using a Sonicare? Absolutely. Would I recommend paying three times more for one of their most advanced models? Not unless you’ve got money to burn.</p>

<h5 id="i-keep-coming-back-to-sonicare">I keep coming back to Sonicare.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sonicare&rsquo;s Flexcare Platinum is a wonderful electric toothbrush. It has a nice feature set, is compact, and does a great cleaning job.Let me preface this review by saying that I have owned many electric toothbrushes over the years, and my favorites have always been Sonicares. Recently, I had an Oral-B Professional 4000 and liked it well enough, but I missed my Sonicare, so I bought this one.This model Sonicare is much smaller than the older model I used to have, and smaller still than even the Oral-B. Still it is large enough to grip easily. It&rsquo;s also very nicely made, with high-quality plastics and a good feel in the hand. Included with the Sonicare are two brush heads, a charging base, and a hard travel case (which is nice, but I prefer the soft travel cases that the Sonicares used to come with).I picked this particular model Sonicare because I liked the three modes it offered. There are regular clean mode, whitening mode, and deep clean mode. I use the regular mode in the morning and deep clean at night. The regular mode is the standard 2 minute brushing, while deep clean mode extends the time to 3 minutes. I don&rsquo;t really use the whitening mode, as I&rsquo;ve found them moderately successful at best. In addition to the 3 modes you can also choose from 3 intensity settings. I always use the highest intensity, but it&rsquo;s nice to have a choice. If you&rsquo;ve never used a power toothbrush before you&rsquo;ll probably feel this is a revelation. There is nothing like the squeaky clean feeling that a Sonicare provides.This Sonicare has a built-in timer with quadspacer, which means that every 30-seconds it gives a slight pause letting you know it&rsquo;s time to move onto another quadrant of your mouth (or every 45 seconds in deep clean mode). Once the timer is up the brush turns off.The battery takes about 24 hours to fully charge and is supposed to last about 3 weeks in between charges. Unlike the Oral-B, this battery is a more sophisticated Lithium Ion type.Cleaning up the Sonicare is easy. There aren&rsquo;t many crevices for gunk to build up in and all it needs is a quick rinse under warm water when you&rsquo;re done brushing. I always keep the brush head separated from the handle when I&rsquo;m not using the toothbrush so everything can dry throughly. Unlike older Sonicares the brush head does not have a large cavity where mold and gunk can build up.All in all&hellip; a wonderful brush. Expensive, but wonderful.</p>

<h5 id="simply-amazing">Simply Amazing!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth every penny! In just 2 weeks I noticed a huge difference and even my dentist was impressed. I initially bought this after discovering that my gums were overly inflamed which got my dentist worried and recommended I switch to an electric brush ASAP. On my next appointment she was very impressed and knew right away I had made the switch from manual to electric. I did a lot of research between the Philips Sonicare and Oral B models and what honestly sold me was the battery life. Oral B reviewers reported a lot of issues with battery life after just a few months and for starters, their models need to be recharged on a weekly basis. My Sonicare can go strong for 5 weeks straight! You can&rsquo;t beat that. I brush on level 1 intensity on Deep Clean at night which is 3 minutes and then on regular clean in the morning which is 2 minutes. That&rsquo;s 175 minutes (5 min/day X 7 days/week X 5 weeks) on one charge and I can probably go longer but I don&rsquo;t want it dying out on me mid-way while brushing. The vibration notification I get to notify me to switch between sides (quarterly) is great to help me ensure that I brush each side accordingly. I can&rsquo;t see myself ever switching back to a manual brush after this. It&rsquo;s improved my gums significantly, whitened my teeth more than ever, and improved my breath throughout the day. You cannot put a price on good health!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this brush at the recommendation of my dentist, but I don&rsquo;t really like it. The vibration tickles and itches and sometimes even hurts, and it makes brushing unpleasant.</p>

<p>Works very well. Takes a little to get used to brushing your teeth in slow motion - unit does all the up &amp; down motion - just have to slowly move it across your teeth and gums and&hellip;</p>
