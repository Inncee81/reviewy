<h5 id="this-works-as-described-definately-worth-the-price">This works as described. Definately worth the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this because when I was at work my office has terrible reception. When I had the iphone 4s my reception was spotty. I would occasionally get &ldquo;no service&rdquo; notices and never had more than 1 bar of reception when I was in my office. Frequently I had to go outside dial a call and then hang up as soon as it connected and then I could pull the reception back into the office for awhile.When I got the new i phone se my reception in the office disappeared altogether. I would everyday find new voice mail messages which would pop up while I was driving home from work. I had people tell me that they had called and the phone wouldn&rsquo;t even ring&hellip;just go straight to voice. The same with text messages. Basically I had &ldquo;no service&rdquo; as it said on the screen where the bars of reception normally show.I have had this antenna for a week now and placed it on the window pointing up. The difference is nothing short of miraculous!! I now have 2 bars instead of &ldquo;no service&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t missed any calls and my messages all come through. The difference is like night and day.This antenna is designed for those of us who have zero or very poor reception. It picks up the weak signals and amplifies them enough that your phone can pick them up and you can then use your phone in an area that you previously could not.</p>

<h5 id="seems-to-work-for-us">Seems to work for us.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I normally don&rsquo;t write reviews, but I felt I should on this. I spent the $8 not expecting much. My wife drives a stretch of interstate that is notorious for dead spots. We constantly dropped calls along a certain area of the interstate. I bought this to see if it would help. It really did help. Normally she would have zero bars of Verizon Cell service and with this installed she had and average of 2 bars. After we installed it, we had zero drop calls and before in that area, service was never great. I did install the antenna on the front windshield vice the rear, that may have some bearing on the better signal. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t realize the wiper blade would hit the antenna. Removal was pretty easy with a plastic putty knife in only a few minutes. I did destroy the tape, but bought new tape from Lowe&rsquo;s and all is well again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="saved-my-day">Saved my day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Increased T-Mobile reception from 0 bars to 1-2 bars, indoors (home), in one isolated area (say, a couple of square feet). Trust me, it&rsquo;s great achievement. I tried different phones with no luck, and was almost ready to buy a re-transmitter (they typically cost north of $150).Caveats:1. I first attached both pieces to the opposite sides of a window, and got no signal improvement. It was pain to remove them, I thought I&rsquo;d break the windows. The 3M thing is &ldquo;extra-hard&rdquo; grade, which is probably permanent once it fully dries out. I used a sharp knife to carefully &ldquo;spoil&rdquo; 3M around the perimeter, and then applied constant pressure for a minute, so it gradually detached without breaking my window. Beware. Don&rsquo;t use included 3M until you&rsquo;re certain you&rsquo;ve found best position. Use a simple scotch tape for experiments. Note: car windows are much stronger, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about them. I&rsquo;d worry about house windows.2. It took me maybe 5 minutes to find a good spot and orientation of this thing. Turned out to be fully indoors! Attached to my monitor stand and pointing to the window at sharp angle.With all these caveats, it&rsquo;s still 5 stars due to the value for the price.Even if it wouldn&rsquo;t work for you at all, this thing has a good chance of working and considering the price of &ldquo;experiments&rdquo; with other equipment it&rsquo;s worth trying! It&rsquo;s kinda unfortunate to see such a low average review score for a thing that can work! (but maybe not always/not for everyone), just because of plentiful of 1 star ratings from people for whom it didn&rsquo;t work.If you&rsquo;re ready to pay significant moneys for &ldquo;proper&rdquo; solutions (such as buying an active re-transmitter, or changing phone provider, &hellip;or maybe even moving?), I&rsquo;d say give this passive repeater a chance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gains are small but significant considering I live and work in a rural area wheres there are more cows and horses than than there are cell towers this small inexpensive antenna makes a difference ,I have far less dropped calls. While driving home I will travel from 4g with 5 bars to 2g with two bars and it will fluctuate from 1 bar at 2g to three every little fluctuation would drop my call. However since installing this on my car. I&rsquo;m able to stay on the call regardless of the flipping fluctuation. According to my callers, on occasion the drop from three bars to one bar and up to three again on 2g network will cause my voice to shutter. Keep in mind that no cell company has coverage in every area that one travels through. I drive roughly 150 to 200 miles a day mostly through rural and farm areas I spend a lot of time in my car All things considered it works well.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-have-zero-to-one-bar-this-helps">If you have zero to one bar this helps!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This antenna definitely helped me get an extra half a bar. I&rsquo;m in a river valley in a small town with AT&amp;T service and I had zero to one bar - with no ability to call someone unless I went outside. Now I always have one bar, and about half of the time I can make an outgoing call indoors. The reason I gave it 5 stars is the price. What do you expect for a few bucks? It works for someone like me who had practically no signal, and I knew going in that this product wasn&rsquo;t going to do too much - because it&rsquo;s just an antenna (with no magical properties).</p>

<p>My house has wall insulation with aluminum foil and all windows with metal screens. House blocks signal from outside. I had about -119 db or one bar before installation. After Ant installation, I have about -112 or 3 bars. It is good enough to use cell phone with data in house now. Just a note. If you don&rsquo;t have any signal, this ANT may not work for you.</p>
