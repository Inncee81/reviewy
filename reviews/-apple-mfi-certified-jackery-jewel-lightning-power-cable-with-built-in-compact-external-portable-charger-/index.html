<h5 id="a-quick-and-simple-booster-that-will-get-you-a-little-more-run-time-when-you-need-it-does-not-replace-larger-battery-banks">A quick and simple booster that will get you a little more run time when you NEED it. Does not replace larger battery banks.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I paid full price for this, I was not given a discount for a review.This device is something you&rsquo;d use to solve a short-term problem - like you need your phone to work for another hour before you can get to a real charger. I found that when you put an iOS device into &ldquo;battery save&rdquo; mode, you can actually get nearly 3 hours additional run time - but it will not fully charge an iPhone 6 from anything less than 50%.For me, it&rsquo;s a 1-device solution - I like to travel as light as possible, and this thing reduces the amount of cables I need to carry. It&rsquo;s been in my bag on several trips, including a family vacation and it has held up fine.As with all devices, RTFM - there&rsquo;s lots of good information.One small complaint is that the manual is NOT online at the makers site at this time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-great-but-doesn-t-work">Looks great but doesn&rsquo;t work.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One star rating. I&rsquo;m not sure if the unit is defective or the design just doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;ll charge my iPhone 6 about 1% then shut off. You can get more charging by plugging and unplugging though. Same goes for trying to use it as a regular cable while traveling. It&rsquo;ll work for a minute or two, then cut out.Dissatisfied, but outside the return period since I didn&rsquo;t bother to function check prior to my trip. It was a bit surprising to have it not work when I was ~1500 miles from home.Update:Even after months of trial and error, the unit is a dud. Won&rsquo;t even work as a standard iphone cable, as it connects, and then disconnects a few minutes later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-be-aware-before-you-buy">Just Be Aware Before you Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Firstly this product works as advertised. It works as a lightning cable and give you a little extra power. What could be better describes is how much a little extra power is.With what I thought was a full charge on the cable it took my phone from about 45% battery to about 52% battery in 21 minutes and then the charge was empty. I made sure i didn&rsquo;t use my phone while charging to get things accurate.This isn&rsquo;t a full battery pack, so if that is what you want don&rsquo;t buy it.Also I don&rsquo;t think the battery charges while your phone is hooked into it, I could be wrong, but it took me a minute to figure that out, but it seemed that when I had my phone hooked up to it when I first got it and then tried to use the battery feature nothing happened until I had it hooked up to charge without anything connected. This could be better explained in the instructions if true.It is well designed, and works as advertised, but I think 3 hours of extra battery life may be stretching it a little bit, even in standby mode. Overall if you need another lightning cable and want to spend an extra 10 bucks you can get a little extra batery life for a little price, just be aware that is is a &ldquo;little&rdquo; bit of extra battery life.</p>

<h5 id="bad-news-you-most-likely-are-going-to-need-to-use-the-warranty">bad news, you most likely are going to need to use the warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good news first, it does seem to have a warranty. Now the bad news, you most likely are going to need to use it! First blush poor design. They could have put the batter closer to the USB connector, so every time you used your phone, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to have the battery lugging around, increasing stress on the phone and connectors.About the connectors / cords. You have $ major point of failure. 1&gt; Lightening connector. No strain relief at all! we all know that is the place most likely location of failure. Many mauf. choose to beef this failure point up a bit, but guess what, not here. Take that same lack of strain relief and you have it at 3 other locations. I would return it, but threw away the packaging in error. One reason it gets 2 stars is I like the idea, planned to keep it in my bike bag for emergency charges, but can;t take a change on how poorly it is made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="read-the-specs-before-you-buy">Read the specs before you buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so a lot of people are looking at this cable with slightly unrealistic expectations, so lets look at the specs.450 mAh @ 3.7V which breaks down to 1.665 Wh1A 5V output, which translates to 5W1.<sup>665</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>*60 = 19.98 minutes of power, which matched my ipad when I was testing with a stopwatch.This product could use some improvement though, as the bulge is about the size of an 18650, which is a disappointment considering one of those can pack a punch of about 2100 mAh at mininum. It works excellently as a cable, which puts it on par with one of Apple&rsquo;s extremely overpriced cables.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ingenious-cable-and-battery-in-one">Ingenious, cable and battery in one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought so many of these for myself, for friends and family as they make a great gift. Phone charging and you need to leave, just take the cable with you, it has a built in battery! Really it is such a great idea. While it won&rsquo;t fully charge my iPhone 7+ it does give it enough juice on the go to keep be going until I can plug it back into a power source.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-concept-and-it-works-as-stated">Great concept and it works as stated</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great concept and it works as stated. However the battery should be bigger. Other than that it is great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-for-iphone-users-highly-recommend-it">Great product for iPhone users! Highly recommend it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Enjoyed the battery bump included with cord, excellent add-on. Great gift for my son due to his use while on the bus. Excellent product for teen usage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Compact charger perfect for charging headphones on the go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fell-apart">Fell apart!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fell apart after 3 months of use. Pretty disappointed with it. Hoping that Jackery will make this right via Warranty.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="execution-is-meh">Execution is Meh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The unit is actually a bit larger than expected and has smaller charge than would be expected for its size. The idea is cool but the execution is meh.</p>

<h5 id="so-so-bad-not-as-written-on-the-description">so so bad. not as written on the description</h5>

<p>so so bad . not as written on the description!</p>

<p>works well you just got to make sure you turn it off when you plug it in or it will ruin the battery</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-annoying-and-would-not-recommend">Very annoying, and would not recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After two or three months of normal use, it started making an extremely high pitched buzzing noise whenever it was charging. Very annoying, and would not recommend.</p>
