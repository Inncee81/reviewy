<h5 id="quick-video">Quick Video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I did a quick video on this backpack rather than pictures because this company did a good job of showing what you were buying that way. In my video, I showed all its features and gave my opinion. Overall, I think it&rsquo;s a great backpack and I am very happy with my purchase for its price.What I did forget to mention in the video is that I had no trouble with the shipping. I got the backpack fast and it actually arrived sooner than I had expected. Also, I had the backpack for a few weeks and traveled around with it, and it&rsquo;s still practically new. I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t regret this purchase because I haven&rsquo;t.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="perfect-size-so-many-compartments-for-organizing">PERFECT size, so many compartments for organizing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely LOVE this backpack. It has great padding in the lower back, shoulders and straps. There are a ton of pockets and you can keep your backpack nice and organized. There are two pockets on the outer sides for drinks or whatever else you might put in there. There are two small compartments on the outside, the bigger one has more compartments in it for storage. There&rsquo;s a hidden pocket in the back behind the padding where your lower back is touching the backpack. Then in the biggest part of the backpack there is a section for your computer (along with cords to hook it up, for audio jack and to charge a phone by usb) then there are a couple slots for organizing different items you want to carry in your backpack and pen/pencil holders. All in all I am very pleased. Its big enough, but not too big and bulky. Just the right size. I really like that the back can completely open up instead of a zipper that only opens half way. I&rsquo;ll include pictures to show you.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-i-love-this-backpack-very-impressed-with-the-look-and-functionality">Great quality, I love this backpack. Very impressed with the look and functionality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> So excited I found this backpack as I needed a new laptop case and I am very impressed with the quality and size. This feels very protective, looks well designed, and has lots of space inside of it. I like that there are so many pockets, and the back in particular has a nice padded pocket that is well hidden from anyone while you have it on. I love having a holder on the side for my water bottle. Overall, definitely a great pick and very high quality at a reasonable price for such a great product.READ MORE</p>

<p>Laptop Backpack, Sosoon Business Bags with USB Charging Port Anti-Theft Water Resistant Polyester School Bookbag for College Travel Backpack for 15.6-Inch Laptop and Notebook, BlackWhat a great laptop backpack. I bought this backpack for my son who is going back to college this summer. He is thrilled. The bag is made of very sturdy polyester and has an abundance of padding for not only good protection for your laptop, but also to cushion your back as you carry your load. There are so may pockets spread both inside and out to house all of your school accessories.The coolest feature is the external USB interface. You can charge your laptop without ever taking it out of your bag and risking damage. I have a laptop backpack myself, and I wish it had this feature.So far we are very pleased with this backpack and would highly recommend it for anyone needing effective protection for your laptop as well as a place for all of your classroom needs.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-backpack-for-the-price-and-awesome-for-anyone-that-carries-around-a-lot-of-small-items">Great backpack for the price, and awesome for anyone that carries around a lot of small items.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this backpack for school, since I was getting tired of my old backpack that had nowhere near enough pockets. I don&rsquo;t actually have a laptop, but I have a good number of relatively small items that I like to have easily accessible (glasses, lanyard, phone, pencil case etc.). I don&rsquo;t really have much to say about the shoulder straps, because I use shoulder strap pads, but they do seem firm, and have an interesting block shaped foam. The back side has 3 patches of light foam padding, but I don&rsquo;t wear my backpack tight enough to really feel it.Layout(Pockets):There&rsquo;s the large compartment in the back, that can open all the way up where your laptop is supposed to go. It has a 3 divided sections that can fit larger stuff such as a laptop, tablet, and folders, and a couple of pockets near the top (essentially my favorite part about the bag, because the one thing I hate is having to dig near the bottom of my bag for something that I&rsquo;m going to be reaching for relatively frequently). Secondly, there is the middle compartment with a few small pockets. Next there&rsquo;s the front compartment that is just a single pocket without any smaller compartments. Lastly, there&rsquo;s 2 water bottle pockets on each side which are pretty neat.Overall great backpack (especially for the price) , and I would definitely recommend this for anyone that wants to have a lot of their small/medium items easily accessible.*** Will update if any issues arise ***READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This backpack is so cool! I use it for work, since I have to carry a laptop. It has so many pockets that are perfectly located and sized; it&rsquo;s super convenient and is stylish too! With the padding on the shoulders, the weight of the laptop (and thirty other things I carry) doesn&rsquo;t hurt my shoulders at all! This is a great backpack for anyone travelling, commuting, or just running around town!!!Laptop Backpack, Sosoon Business Bags with USB Charging Port Anti-Theft Water Resistant Polyester School Bookbag for College Travel Backpack for 15.6-Inch Laptop and Notebook, BlackREAD MORE</p>

<p>Well constructed but a bit small inside. The main zipper is indeed concealed from &lsquo;burglars&rsquo; but it makes it cumbersome to open.</p>
