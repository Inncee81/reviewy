<h5 id="can-t-go-wrong-with-this-tripod-especially-for-the-price">Can&rsquo;t go wrong with this tripod, especially for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I take this tripod with me where ever I go to take photos. It&rsquo;s very sturdy and does not feel cheap at all, unlike some other ones sold here on Amazon. Even has a leveler and handle build in. Can&rsquo;t ask for anything more. It also comes with a handy carrying case. I highly recommend this tripod!&ndash;UPDATE 02/16/14&mdash;&ndash;It&rsquo;s still going strong and I use it occasionally. No issues whatsoever. I put my Nikon D3200 on it and it works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice entry-level tripod. It&rsquo;s a little taller than I pictured when fully extended, this is definitely a plus. I like the aluminum legs over plastic as it feels more substantial while still being lightweight. I do wish it had 3 leg extensions instead of 2 so it&rsquo;d be a little more compact when not extended, but it&rsquo;s not a deal breaker and I think it was done to make sure the design was more solid.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was mostly because of the removable base that the camera connects to. It&rsquo;s a great idea so you can unclip the device to use it freehand for a while without taking the time to unscrew it, but being that this part is plastic, it makes the top plate a little wiggly when it shouldn&rsquo;t be which kind of defeats the purpose of having a tripod in the first place unless you can use a remote shutter release. It&rsquo;s not extremely bad but it&rsquo;s noticeable and I&rsquo;ve messed up a couple shots just by pushing the button on my camera. The adjustments can be a little jerky, but being that most of that stuff is plastic it&rsquo;s to be expected, and I wouldn&rsquo;t really expect more in something at this price.Bottom line: If you&rsquo;re looking for something for casual use or to get started then go for it, but if you&rsquo;re looking for something professional you&rsquo;re in the wrong price range.</p>

<h5 id="the-best-buy-in-very-good-quality-tripods-and-it-s-bargain-basement-priced-buy-it-these-things-are-great">The best buy in very good quality tripods and it&rsquo;s bargain basement priced! BUY IT! These things are GREAT!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a FANTASTIC tripod! Looked at a lot of new tripods in the last few months (and some nice used ones) but bang-for-buck, you CANNOT do better than this one. The build quality is superb, all the functions are smooth as butter, it comes in a very nice carry bag and they also throw in a lens cleaning cloth for some reason, very nice, and a funny little key chain/LED flash light with the company&rsquo;s logo on it! Didn&rsquo;t really need that, but getting unexpected freebies is a nice touch.The tripod itself is the big seller though, as it&rsquo;s built just as well as the heavy-duty jobs of the late sixties&rsquo; and early seventies&rsquo; - only without the weight and awkwardness. This will likely be my &ldquo;go to&rdquo; tripod for a long time to come. I have others, including a Profilo 6131, but for an on-the-go tripod, this thing is awesome. BUY IT, you will not regret it.</p>

<h5 id="nice-sturdy-light-wieght-tripod">Nice sturdy light wieght tripod</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>packaging quite sufficient. Carry case nice and compact. very sturdy for a light weight tripod. Only thing I was not totally impressed with was the extender turning handle. Appears to be somewhat fragile. If used repeatedly I suspect it would break.Update on this review. I was contacted by the customer service dept. of SPN Performance. the company who manufactures this item.I had a very productive conversation with a rep., and it was established that the issue was most likely that the gear mechanism was a little tight due to the fact that the product was new. I will continue to watch the performance of this product, but I do not anticipate any major failure of it&rsquo;s operation. Amazon people this is a company that you should continue to work with. Their customer service is exceptional!</p>

<h5 id="ravelli-aplt4-great-value">Ravelli APLT4 GREAT Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After I shopped around quite a bit for a good reliable Tripod, I put this one on my wish list, and my wife got it for me. Super glad she did! I have a Cannon 20D, fits on there like a glove, even with my 300mm Zoom lens on it. The quick release is super handy, It took me a minute or two to make sure I got the attachment that goes on the camera right, but really it was pretty simple, and once it was right, I snugged it down and I just leave it on there. It also has 2 Levels on it, I didn&rsquo;t see that on the other ones, this was a HUGE deal to me. Its also very sturdy, I saw some people say it wasn&rsquo;t great in wind, but I haven&rsquo;t had any issues as of yet. I&rsquo;ve been shooting with it for 3 weeks now.So here are some pros and consPros:2 Levelers, one on the legs and one on the swivel. To me, shooting nature photography, its a must to at least have the one on the legs, but to have another on swivel as well is even better!Height. Don&rsquo;t be fulled Once you extend the legs all the way THERE IS MORE! Just loosen the center ball, and twist the crank on the side, and watch in enjoyment as your camera gets lifted to new heights. I am 5&rsquo; 7&rdquo;(6 if I am honest) so at 61&rsquo;, with my camera on it, it puts the view finder right where my eye is. PLUS it goes down really short too! Super handy for shots of water areas to get that lower angle. Also it works well as support when trying to look up at something and shoot. Like up at a tree.Very sturdy even when fully extended I was taking a shot of a landscape about a week and a half ago from a decent slope. The level helped me get the camera level, and it set perfectly with no issues.The legs can be adjusted quickly and easilyHook for extra weight in windy situations, I haven&rsquo;t used this part yet, but I plan on it for storm spotting.Cons(Or the one Con I have foundLast week I was at the lake, fishing while snapping some photos. I didn&rsquo;t think I left the tripod out for to long, but when I went to put it away the seal on the handle was bubbling(slightly), now keep in mind I live in Denver, so the sun rays are more damaging here. My skin found that out the first summer I lived here. But really its just a very slight cosmetic issue.But for the money, you can&rsquo;t beat it!</p>
