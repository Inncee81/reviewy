<h5 id="great-drone-for-a-beginner">Great Drone for a Beginner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Fantastic as my first quadcopter. I got this bundle and was pleasantly surprised to find that the extra batteries was 600mAh batteries instead of the 500mAh battery that comes with the unit. Being an extra capacity battery gives you longer flight times. I have run this unit into trees, the car, and the house and it just keeps flying. Very sturdy unit for a beginner. This inexpensive drone has surpassed all of my expectations. The camera is very good for what it is. I attached a short video so you can see what type of quality you can expect from the camera Before you start flying the unit I recommend that you put a drop of superglue onto the light covers since one of mine popped off when I crashed the unit. It popped right back on and I superglued it and the other three to try and prevent them from popping off again. All in all I am very happy with this quadcopter and if you or one of your kids are looking to learn the basics of flying quadcopters this would be a good unit to start with.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-for-the-money-i-will-buy-another-because-i-flew-mine-away">Fantastic for the money!!! I will buy another because I flew mine away.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I bought this because some of my friends have been playing with quadcopters (drones). First let me say that it requires some serious hand/eye coordination. I was told to buy a cheap drone to learn the basics and yesterday I understand why. I flew it on a still day but evidently at a certain height the wind was pretty strong. I got up high and the wind took the drone and basically I lost it. One of those good lessons to learn, the wife was not happy but I still like to learn and play with interesting stuff. One general note, I am in my early 50&rsquo;s and your reaction time and coordination naturally decline with age. One of my friends has a racing quad copter (he is in his late 40&rsquo;s) and he said he simply cannot react fast enough to fly it well. This is no racing quad but keep that in mind, I can see why he said that now, you must concentrate on it.The camera makes pretty decent video (see attached). I took the video at our beach house, I thought it was pretty good for an inexpensive quadcopter and very inexperienced flyer (less than 2 hours practice). I will be buying another one.Pros:InexpensiveGreat for the moneyCons:Requires very good hand/eye coordination.</p>

<h5 id="fun-to-fly-and-a-great-value-for-beginners">Fun to fly and a great value for beginners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great quadcopter kit for the price. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it as a first quad, as it is for me. I found it easy to pick up and learn how to fly it. The extra batteries come in handy since the quad only has about 7 minutes of flight time. I&rsquo;d prefer if the kit came with one less set of propellers and an extra battery or an extra set of prop guards. The prop guards are really thin plastic and deform easily. If they deform enough the propellers will hit the guards while spinning so you have to bend them back. The quad is light and therefore even if it hits something damage is unlikely. The extra SD card is pretty pointless.Another advantage this quad has over some other beginner quads is the overall size. I found the combination of bright underside lights and the overall size helpful in keeping track of where the quad is. I could imagine some smaller quads getting too far and getting lost from beginner pilots since they could become difficult to see. I never had this issue with the X5C.The camera is simple to use but as expected the quality is rudimentary at best. You can distinguish people even in low light conditions though (I tested around dusk).One word of caution is that there&rsquo;s not really an indication when the quad is about to lose battery with adequate warning (or at least not that I&rsquo;ve found), so you have to get a feel for the power curve of the LiPo batteries and bring the quad lower when the motors become sluggish.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I&rsquo;ll begin by saying I&rsquo;m very new to this. I picked up a Hubsan X4 and this quad. I knew that the Hubsan would be a challenge because of it&rsquo;s size. Six hours later I could hover thew small Hasban. It was now time to try the Syma. It flew beautifully. Control was precise, without noticeable overshoot. After becoming familiar with the Syma indoors, I took it outside to a small, sheltered grass covered spot to practice. After flying it within the safe, confined area, I felt brave enough to send it up. It went up and up and up. I was terrified, the quad was now in peril. It was no longer safe and sheltered. It went up about 75 feet. Then it got caught in a breeze. Corrections were easy, the SYMA handled the breeze (a hurricane for me) easily and confidently. There was more than enough thrust available. I did shoot some video of my inaugural flight. Even in my inexperienced hands, and in the presence of a breeze, the Syma hovered nicely. If I did this right, a short video clip is attached. The video would have been longer, but the battery was just about dead.About thrust, it&rsquo;s really something. Once off the ground, the throttle goes back, I can hear the rotors slow down considerably. There is power to spare. Along with the video there is audio. This seems a bit pointless, but it did serve a purpose. I could listen to thrust applied for altitude. The audio did add a sense of &ldquo;being there&rdquo;. While experienced pilots may laugh at this, it added to the experience of my watching my quadcopter climb above the rooftops.The Syma is a beautiful piece of technology, especially when the price is considered. Video quality is more than good enough for me. Video looks fine on my 50&rdquo; flat screen.The quadcopter has been subjected to a few crashes, one or two of them a bit scary. The Syma remains undamaged.I&rsquo;m a lifelong photographer who is ready for a new challenge. My goal is to get good enough to send a $1500 flyer up in the air. The Syma will teach me flight basics, and the ins and outs of aerial video. This Syma is a great place to start.Why four stars? It&rsquo;s the battery door. The plastic is really flimsy. That is my only complaint.I purchased this from Boom Shop. Packaging was good, delivery was prompt. This is the genuine version 2 quad.Cheersrc</p>
