<blockquote>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s get the power specifications out of the way. An expectation of a robust 135wpc at this price and weight class is unrealistic, and is something of an overstatement for this receiver. Note that Sony only specifies this output at 1khz, not all across the audible range. The more revealing power spec they provide claims 90wpc from 20hz to 20khz (which includes all audible frequencies, of course) into 8 ohms with .09% distortion. That&rsquo;s good. However, it would have been even more informative if Sony had also provided 4 ohm power specs, which would have given an even better idea of how much oomph the amp section is capable. At this price, size, and weight such an omission is understandable. Therefore this receiver should be viewed as, at best, a 90wpc model. That is actually very good for the price, especially for those who understand that power output is not a linear scale - there really isn&rsquo;t much difference between 90wpc and 135wpc. Suffice it to say that most people will be able to crank up the volume louder than they care to listen with most speakers.The reasons I chose to purchase this receiver are it&rsquo;s low price and the fact that I still own and use one of its very similar predecessors from a decade ago, the STR185DE, rated 100wpc at this same price. I almost never turn it off - in other words after roughly ten years of virtually continuous service, it still looks and sounds new, and the remote control as well as front panel controls all still function properly. I anticipate that this descendant of the 185 will perform just as reliably. I also believe that the other brands available at less money will neither hold up so well, nor sound as good. This belief is based on many years experience as an audio enthusiast, and former audio salesman.Which brings us to sound quality. I have several systems in my home which include such brands as Lexicon, NAD, Adcom, Paradigm and ADS - highish end brands much more expensive than this receiver. I&rsquo;m using this Sony to drive a pair of ADS L-780 speakers which, though 20+ years old, still look and sound wonderful. I previously used an NAD receiver which cost more than $500 with these ADS. The sound quality is virtually identical using the Sony; I&rsquo;m sure that if blindfolded I&rsquo;d be unable to distinguish between them, and the ADS are very revealing three-way loudspeakers.If you do want a better receiver than this Sony, then I&rsquo;d suggest you check out the Yamaha R-S500BL also available via amazon but at about three times the price. The Onkyo TX-8255 might be a contender at only about $50 more than this Sony, but is not clearly superior in my mind. Or if you want something truly special, look at the Outlaw RR2150 also available here for almost six times the price - I&rsquo;d love to have one of those myself, but it isn&rsquo;t in the budget right now. Plus, I already own some high end separate components anyway (my Adcom power amps are the big ones, originally priced at almost three grand for the pair). I didn&rsquo;t write this to brag; I simply wanted to show that even knowledgeable &lsquo;audiophiles&rsquo; sometimes need a more budget-friendly solution to their audio needs, and that we make careful choices when compromise is necessary. This Sony lacks some of the features of the Yamaha and Outlaw models mentioned above, but nothing else I know of near this price range delivers the sound quality I demand as adequately as does the Sony. Good affordable stuff.UPDATE: Nearing a year of daily use now. Not a glitch, not a hitch. Not the smallest glimmer of a problem. Looks new, sounds new, operates flawlessly. I admit that in this room, I don&rsquo;t push an amp hard at all - when I want to crank hard I have other systems which will do that, no problem. But it&rsquo;s in my computer room and gets used daily, connected to a pair of Paradigm Mini Monitors v3, which despite the name is a pair of decent-sized bookshelf speakers capable of surprisingly deep bass (they&rsquo;re about 14&rdquo; x 8&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; hwd). They sound great with this affordable Sony receiver. So I&rsquo;m still happy with the purchase.Two-year Edit: Still works and sounds like new. Am amazed that this model is currently under review by Amazon due to customer complaints. Mine has been solid. Just ordered two more as Christmas gifts for my sons; I hope theirs are good, too.Third Year Edit: The Sony just keeps working perfectly, remote control and all. Still looks new. This year I gifted another of these, bringing my total to five purchased during these three years. All sound great and I continue to get thank-yous from owners. Great value, especially at sale price.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As in other reviews, mine too stopped working today, after only 3 weeks. I cannot get any power except for a few clicks. I have contacted SONY as I no longer have the original box to send it back to Amazon in and its still under warranty with SONY. It is a hassle going thru them but after a day of trouble shooting (duh, no power to the unit!!) I think I have an exchange set up. Hopefully. The blog at sony mentions this problem too and says it needs some kind of firmware update or something but is is something a Sony dealer has to do. **** DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM*****From the others that have dealt with SONY, I will probably have to pay shipping for the unit too which doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Customer satisfaction should be key here and paying have of the purchase price in shipping costs seems ridiculous.FOLLOW UP COMMENTSee my follow up comment belowTo the Sony rep who told me to follow the link: I had already called and I have been dealing with your awful customer service department for over a week and have gotten nowhere!! Still waiting to be told what do with this.</p>

<h5 id="stereo-for-today">Stereo for Today</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a classical music lover with an extensive stereo-only CD collection, I have been content with a basic system in my study consisting of a receiver, CD player, and tape deck. My receiver recently died. Given my record collection, the current state of classic-music releases and my age (78), it make no sense to opt for a whole surround sound system. Thus, my needs are specialized.After much surfing at all the logical sources, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that simple stereo receivers are still made and sold at current dollar prices below those I paid for either of my earlier purchases. My checking clearly indicated that the Sony receiver selected had more than enough power and features to meet my needs, and that pricier alternatives only added features that I would not use. It is convenient to use and works well with my speaker system. As usual for Amazon, I had learned enough before purchase to know what I would get so there were no unpleasant or pleasant surprises. As also usual with Amazon, the price was right and the shipping speedy.</p>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We hooked the Sony up to our speakers that we bought for outdoors for our flowerbeds and it&rsquo;s great it does the purpose while it&rsquo;s got radio and we hook it up to your iPad . Sound quality is great I can&rsquo;t complain</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-simple-low-priced-stereo-receiver">Very Nice Simple Low-Priced Stereo Receiver!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 25+ years my Panasonic stereo/receiver finally passed out, so I just needed another simple stereo/receiver without all the &ldquo;bells and whistles&rdquo;&hellip;.this Sony definitely accomplishes that, especially with this low price. I hooked it up to a pair of MA Audio speakers, a Sony BlueRay/DVD player, a Sony 55&rdquo; TV, and an FM antenna, that&rsquo;s it and it all works perfectly. When you hook up the TV to the &ldquo;Video&rdquo; Audio Input terminals in the back, make sure that both the TV and the Stereo/Receiver volumes are set to about 35, otherwise the initial volume is so low you will think it is not working. This receiver comes with an AM and an FM antenna. I don&rsquo;t use the AM antenna on this and the FM antenna is basically worthless as it is just a measured-length wire. Instead, I&rsquo;m using a Stellar Labs FM Antenna, model 30-2435 (shown), which connects up to the receiver perfectly using a 75 ohm, F-Connector cable. My DirecTV modem is connected to the TV, and I use the DirecTV remote to switch the stereo/receiver on and off instead of using the included remote. I&rsquo;m very happy with this Sony Stereo/Receiver!</p>
