<h5 id="use-over-the-ear-style-during-running-great-sound-for-bluetooth">Use over the ear style during running! Great Sound for bluetooth.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I never had the jaybird bluebuds x so I can&rsquo;t compare it to that.I purchased mine at bestbuy(to get a geeksquad warranty) about a few weeks ago and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. Jaybirds has a lifetime sweatproof warranty. Here is my 2 cents:Sound quality is great - As good as my $100 bose soundtrue earbuds(for a regular joe, it is more than enough). I use to watch movies on my mac and netflix on my roku and it sounds great.Noise cancelling is passive(enough to zone in but safe enough to hear surroundings while running).Battery life is as advertised - Ran for a week running 5-7 miles daily, watching movies without charging. Gets approximately 8 hours.Connectivity - No issues except for old bluetooth devices. Disconnected once but it was my old 2009 mac(so I bought a bluetooth dongle). Switching from one device to another is very easy. It can only get connected to one device.Fit - The smallest bluetooth earbuds money can buy in the market(I tried a lot ie backbeats go2, jabra sport, etc and they all look like I have a jawbreaker in my ear). The fit is great but when I ran it started to fall off with the sweat and all. The solution: Over the ear fitting. It has been excellent for me during running. I use the under the ear for leisure activities/plane trips because I can secure it around my neck when I temporarily remove them. Just google jaybirds on how to clip it properly(clips included in the purchase), it takes 30 seconds.Things I hate - the case. OMG. Very poorly designed. It is huge and a pain to open/close. The comply eartips has irritated my ears, so I use the silicone(included too).I disagree with other reviewers about not sounding loud enough, I never had a problem with it using spotify, pandora, itunes and even just watching from my mac. IT&rsquo;S ALL ABOUT THE PROPER FIT. Ignore the reviewers that says the sound is tiny, they are not fitting it correctly or they didn&rsquo;t clean their ears.TLDR: Just buy it if you&rsquo;re looking for a bluetooth earbud with good sound quality and comfortable fit. I spent too much time purchasing and returning the cheaper ones. Wear it over the ear when running. If the fit is not great, just return it but give it a shot :)UPDATE(10/24/2015): After 2 months of use, the X2 has been amazing. No lost connections(not even once!), plus the new iOS displays the battery life now. I have been training for a half marathon and using it for traveling, it has not failed me. Devices used: macbook pro late 2011, ipad air 2, tomtom spark cardio + music, iphone 6s.UPDATE(3/7/2016): The X2 has been solid. I have now been using it on a daily basis - I just discovered audiobooks lately and wear the X2 to listen to them on my way to work. Still no spotty bluetooth connections despite heavy use. I am using it for everything, I think I already got my money&rsquo;s worth. Battery life has not worsened after a few months.</p>

<h5 id="not-suited-to-small-ears">Not suited to small ears</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small eared people: you may be disappointed. For perspective, I am an adult female. And now I know I have small, flat ears (or these earbuds lead me to believe so)My Bose earbuds are much more comfortable. These are still a touch too big, and I cannot use the foam tips at all &ndash; it&rsquo;s uncomfortably painful in minutes.The ear wings don&rsquo;t reach my ears either. I put them on as directed in the video, but I cannot put the buds into my ears far enough for them to properly reach (even if I reach back and pull my ear up, as you would for foam hearing protection plugs).The silicone tips are slightly better than the foam ones, as they are thinner, but I don&rsquo;t think I could wear these for even a whole movie. I really would prefer that the bore was smaller, or tapered, or something. I&rsquo;ve had them out for several minutes and my ears still feel funny.The sound is good, especially for bluetooth headsets. It&rsquo;s not comparable to corded sets, but most people already realize this. Not too bassy, very balanced.</p>

<h5 id="only-better-than-average-wireless-sport-headphone-with-a-far-better-marketing-department-than-engineering-department">Only better-than-average wireless sport headphone, with a far better marketing department than engineering department</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>“SignalPlus™ skip-free music”, “SHIFT™” premium audio, X-FIT™ clip options, “Super-Capacity Battery HD™”, “Jenna™ voice prompts”, Liquipel™ Nano water-resistant coating… Yes, those are literally all actual trademarked terms on the back of the Jaybird X2s. Do they actually mean anything at the end of the day? Yes and no. But mostly no.So what <em>do</em> you get for a $180 MSRP sport wireless earphone? Well, you get very well-designed packaging, a nice carry case, and ultimately, a set of sport earphones with competitive battery life, sufficient audio quality, and vastly more fit options than any other earphones in the segment.&gt; FIT, COMFORT, RUNNINGBy far the X2’s greatest strength is the range of fit options offered. Three sizes of silicon ear tips, three sizes of foam Comply ear tips, three sizes of the ear fins, and cord clips that allow for under/over ear fitting as well as a tight or loose cord fit. It took an hour of trial and error to figure out which combination of all those things work the best. However, once I got things figured out, I was able to knock out a four mile run with no fit issues—the X2s stayed firmly in place with a strong seal. <em>IF</em> you can find a fit that works, these are great running earphones. As a side note, if you’re used to balance-armature IEMs like Shures or Etymotics, the X2s are traditional driver based so they have a much larger ear nozzle, are not as comfortable, and don’t insert as deeply into your ear canal; the seal I get on the X2 is far more delicate as the X2 almost sits outside of my ear canal, but the fins really work to keep the seal locked in without issue.&gt; BATTERY LIFEWhen I was looking for a pair of wireless earphones for running a year ago, I scoffed at the price of the Jaybird BlueBud Xs and instead bought a $65 pair of the Plantronics BackBeat GO 2, which are so similar in design and concept to the BlueBud Xs that they might very well be made in the same factory in China. The one marked difference between the two is definitely in battery life. The Plantronics tend to average around 4 hours of use in my experience, and while I haven’t had the X2s long enough to fully assess the battery life on these, it seems pretty impressive and I have confidence they will last the 8 hours as advertised.&gt; SOUND QUALITYBoth the X2s and the Plantronics are designed around a 6mm traditional speaker driver (versus a balanced armature design). In some quick swapping back and forth tests, the X2s do have clearer sound and deeper bass compared with the Plantronics. I’ve got a dozen other headphones/earphones and so the X2s will not replace those for sound quality (i.e., as far as Bluetooth goes, I prefer my Sony SBH-80s and Def Tech Symphony 1s to these), they are more than sufficient to enjoy music while running or on the go. Note that these earphones are designed to seal to provide the best sound quality, so sound quality will be dependent on seal and fit. Also, while I prefer earphones that seal out noise when running, others don’t or consider that to be a safety issue, so take that into account as well when picking out a running headphone. Oh, and the Jenna™ voice prompts? The Plantronics have voice prompts too and they are as equally pointless.&gt; BLUETOOTH CONNECTION STRENGTHThe biggest problem with the Plantronic BackBeat GO 2s was the weakness in connection strength. I’ve got a large Nexus 6 phablet (too large for my arms) so I normally wear it against the small of my back when running; the Plantronics simply can’t handle this (especially in NYC where there is wireless interference EVERYWHERE). I run to music set to my running cadence (165-175 BPM) and so any skipping in signal ends up throwing my running off; I quickly switched back to wired earphones. I was hoping that the much vaunted SignalPlus™ in the X2s would solve these problems. So the bad news is that, as soon as I stepped outside my apartment and started my music, it already began cutting in and out. So much for “skip-free music”. The good news is that once I adjusted my phone a little bit and started moving, the signal seemed to hold a bit better. When doing a 4 mile loop in the park, away from most interference, the signal strength seemed to hold up for the most part. So in short: SignalPlus™ is not some skip free savior and I can get more than my fair share of skips with the phone behind me, but it at least appears to be a bit better than the BackBeat GO 2s.&gt; CONCLUSIONThe Jaybird X2 is a competent wireless sport earphone. It offers a lot of fit options and decent enough sound quality, and so for many looking for a straightforward solution to a running headphone for which price is not an issue, then it is a safe bet to try. However, a lot of the X2 selling points are marketing hyperbole that make the X2s seem “great,” when they are just “good.” No, despite the SHIFT™ custom SBC codec, the Bluetooth audio is good, but not better than other Bluetooth headphones I have. No, despite SignalPlus™, I can reliably induce wireless dropouts, though they seem to carry signal better than some comparable sport earphones. Will I keep them? Probably yes, since I hate running with wired earphones. Do I think they are worth the $180 MSRP? Definitely not.On a final note, it’s a little bit disappointing that literally <em>NONE</em> of the X2’s product specifications have changed from the prior Bluebuds X Sport. The weight is the same, the specified battery life is the same, the speaker driver is the same size, no added IPX waterproofing rating, it all appears the same except with soft-touch plastic design, a new case, better ear fins, and the Comply foam tips. Jaybird has gone on record stating that for this new model, “even though the specs all look very similar on paper, the reality is that you are getting brand new parts for 2015 instead of parts made for 2013.” Perhaps that’s true, but a cynical person wouldn’t be blamed for thinking that this “model upgrade” was really just the same headphones but with a reset 2015 “Premium” price for headphones whose price has since eroded a bit since the 2013 launch of the original BlueBuds X Sport.</p>
