<h5 id="absolute-easiest-set-up-ever-ready-to-use-in-minutes-numerous-options-available">Absolute easiest set up ever! Ready to use in minutes! Numerous options available!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wireless WiFi Camera by LeFun is an excellent choice!We have used cameras in our home for years. We have adopted several special needs kids and with a large home of over 6,000 square feet, needed a way to be able to check on all our kids. We now have a toddler in our home that of course needs a constant eye. We wanted to add another camera to place in our basement where our autistic son sleeps. He has been known to run and with a walkout basement, makes it easier for him. I like being able to watch him when he is in his room playing. I was looking at all the different options when I came across this one. I was offered the opportunity to receive this in exchange for my review and I jumped at the chance.I received the camera within a few days and was anxious to get it set up but also hesitant. Anyone who has used cameras knows that set up can be a long and tedious project. My husband and I have used numerous brands and models. We always based our decision on the features each camera offered. We have invested literally thousands of dollars on cameras that now sit in a closet unused. I have spent hours on the phone with technicians, customer service, anyone who could help set up our cameras. After my experiences, in all honesty, I dreaded the setup process. I cannot believe LeFun has made it this easy to set up a camera. It literally took me under a minute to get the camera connected to my Wi-Fi and was able to use it within a half an hour. The longest process with the setup on this camera was waiting for the app to download! This camera has been the easiest, most convenient camera to setup!It gives you two options for setup. You can connect it with an ethernet cable to your router or set it up wirelessly. I chose to set it up wirelessly. I simply plugged the camera in and allowed it to start up. It will blink its lights and scan the room taking approximately one minute. Once the green light flashes steadily it is ready to be connected. While waiting for the camera to start up I went to the app store and downloaded their app called MIPC. This allows you to see the video on your phone. After downloading and opening the app, I created an account, made sure that my phone and the camera were on the same network (we use several in our home) and then scanned the camera using the QR scanner built into the app. The camera has a QR code attached to the bottom. The app immediately noticed the camera and connected instantly. I brought up live video right on my iPhone! You can also set your computer up to view the video from there as well.There are settings you can use to personalize your camera. You choose how you want the date and time displayed if you want to activate the built-in alarm or if you want to be notified when the camera picks up motion or sound. You can even set up a schedule for the alerts and alarm to only notify you certain times of the day. It also records video. You choose how you want it to record as well. You can schedule for certain times of the day, only when it senses motion, or you can turn this feature off altogether. There is a spot in the back that allows you to place an SD card to store the recordings on but it also gives you an option of storing this on an external device. Another setting allows you to increase or decrease the volume of the speaker/mic. You can also upgrade the device right through the app! This is great because it doesn&rsquo;t require you to unhook the camera and take it to your computer to upgrade. This is a two-way communicator too. You can speak through the app and it comes across clearly and it allows you to hear any noise. The option to turn the volume off completely is also available.This camera has been fantastic! I absolutely love it! I read some reviews that said it doesn&rsquo;t stay connected wirelessly but I haven&rsquo;t experienced that at all. In a 6,000+ square foot home, the camera being in the basement and my router being on the main floor at the opposite end of the house, it has never disconnected. I am assuming this problem is related to their internet service, ​not the camera.Overall, we are more than pleased with this camera and highly recommend it to anyone!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="awesome-night-vision">Awesome Night Vision</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this camera for awhile now and really like it. I wanted something basic that acted as an indoor security camera and this fit the bill nicely. Once you install the free app on your phone or computer you can completely control the camera functions including panning, tilting, and zooming.Setup was fairly straight forward out of the box. I personally found it easier to setup by first plugging in the included Ethernet cable from the camera to my router. Once I did that it was easy to connect to my home WiFi. As soon as the camera was connected online it automatically downloaded and updated it&rsquo;s firmware to the latest version. Once I was hooked up to my WiFi I was able to unplug the Ethernet cable and it worked great. You don&rsquo;t have to do it that way, you can just connect wirelessly but there are a few more steps involved which are explained in the manual.Once I had the app installed on my phone I was able to connect directly to the camera. The picture quality was OK (720p) and it was easy to control. My dogs loved the 2 way audio feature. I went upstairs and spoke to them through the built in speakers and they went bananas haha! You can also access the settings through your phone to adjust motion settings, schedule recordings, alerts, etc. Everything was very straight forward.Being that I&rsquo;m using this as an indoor security camera I set mine up to record onto a microSD card (not included&ndash;64GB max) only when it detects motion. You can record 24 hours/day but I didn&rsquo;t really need that. By far my favorite feature is the night vision. It will switch to night vision automatically and the video clarity was amazing in a pitch black room&ndash;very impressive!The only small issue I&rsquo;ve had is with minor video jerkiness sometimes. It&rsquo;s rated at 25 frames per second but every now and then it would freeze for like 2 seconds then jump to real time again. This wasn&rsquo;t a huge deal but it&rsquo;s noticeable. Perhaps if it was connected directly to a LAN connection it may be a little smoother rather than over WiFi. For the price I can honestly say I&rsquo;m happy with it&rsquo;s performance.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="really-great-camera">Really great camera!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super easy to set up, works amazing and gives up the peace of mind that we can monitor our child without disturbing her.Highly recommend this one as it is so easy to use compared to others.Make sure you read the directions and follow them closely. You will have ZERO problems if you do that.UPDATE: I liked this so much, we purchased a second camera. Now I have control over both cameras via 1 app. The cameras have really been great. Video, audio and all functions have worked excellent. I work over seas and can log in to check on my home at anytime via my wifi connected phone.The night vision is crystal clear as well as day time mode.Can not say enough about these. They truly are a blessing!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="super-easy-to-set-up">Super easy to set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super easy to set up, IDK why people are saying its not.. It gave us step by step directions. I got 720p and picture quality is great! We had lots of fun playing around with the features. Mainly used for baby cam but when we left the house for the weekend we just put it downstairs as security and spied on the cats and tried to confuse them by talking through the camera. We plan on getting more in the future. The one thing I could complain about is the app on my phone shuts down a lot and I have to log in again, but my husband says his doesn&rsquo;t. Sooooooo..READ MORE</p>
