<p>Package Quantity:1
This unique stress ball is fun and addictive. The elastic skin is filled with squeezable beads and bright shiny glitter. It glides through your fingers and sort of crunches when you squish it. Relieve some stress with every squeeze of the bead stress ball.</p>

<h5 id="the-contents-of-these-balls-are-very-fine-and-very-slippery-potential-hazard">The contents of these balls are /very/ fine and /very/ slippery. Potential hazard.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first, I had been quite happy with this purchase. The ball was hard to squeeze during the first day I had it, but was quickly broken in by insistent squeezing. It admittedly made my hands ache, which had been tolerable once it began to be easier to work with. During the first day; the colors bled horribly, staining my hands and even the other colors on the ball itself. I washed my hands numerous of times, and even tried washing the ball itself with mild soap and water. It would help for a while, before it began bleeding again- calling for another round of washing. This was not too pleasing, but I did like stress-ball aspect of it, and thus attempted to simply deal with it. Within the next day or two, the outer layer snapped around the middle, exposing the inner -but intact latex-. Now, this proved to be a plus, for that day. After ridding of the outer skin as much as I was capable, I found that I had much prefered it this way; and proceeded to enjoy it for another day. However, a few moments ago whilst I had been chatting with a friend at my computer -using the ball, of course-, the latex sack burst, spilling an extremely fine dust onto my desk and my front. Fortunately, my laptop had escaped this eruption. After pardoning myself with an aggitated sigh, I went about cleaning up the mess. On the way to the trash can, a bit of the sand had fallen to the floor- unnoticed at first. I threw away the bag and dusted my shirt off over the bin, before washing my hands in the sink. On my way back to my room, I stepped into the sand that had spilled earlier, and nearly slipped. <strong>The contents of these balls are very, /very/ fine and /very/ slippery</strong>. After cleaning even /that/ mess up, I am still finding silt deposites of what had once been my stress ball between my fingers and on my flooring. What started out as a decent object to fiddle with, quickly spiraled into a disappointment. I do not recommend these cheap sacks to anyone.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-rolling-plopping-not-for-the-weak-handed">Great for rolling, plopping. Not for the weak handed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good price for the product. Seems durable and I&rsquo;m not concerned with it breaking. I got it for my desk at work. It&rsquo;s not a super easy squish. More of a hand work-out. I would not recommend it for people with weak hands or those looking just to a stress-squeezer. I find it&rsquo;s best to roll across my desk with my palm and fingers. It rolls and squishes at the same time, as well as making a soothing noise. It&rsquo;s also good for dropping from a low height as it flattens on the bottom and sits. Good product for rolling/dropping, less good for squeezing unless looking for a bit of a work-out. I love it though!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended">Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how other reviewers are using this stress ball, but I&rsquo;ve got two (one for work and one for home) and they have both held up for 2-3 months with heavy use, and show no undue signs of wear. The material inside feels just like sand, and provides just enough shape retention to be satisfying.My only gripe is that the lighter colored rubber material is almost a magnet for dead skin. It pretty quickly turned from a bright yellow to a dingy greenish color (and I&rsquo;m very fastidious about hand washing - you have to be with kids in the house). The black rubber, on the other hand, must be a different material or something, because it looks perfect and is still soft and smooth even after repeated use. I&rsquo;ve washed them several times and they clean off nicely and have still held up fine.</p>

<h5 id="physical-therapy-for-hand">Physical Therapy for Hand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I first purchased this as a physical therapy item for a broken hand. The ball makes a great cast rest (like a mini bean bag) for when you have a hard cast but need some minor elevation to prevent swelling. After the cast was off, and to date (years after the injury) I use the ball to stretch my tendons and strengthen the hard to exercise outer pinky and outside palm. The squishy sand interior is fairly stiff and provides good resistance for micro movements like pinching. The ball lasts about 6 months with gentle everyday use, but this is really two balloons with sand in it and cannot stand rough treatment or sharp nails. Small enough to fit in a purse.</p>

<h5 id="the-very-best-exercise-ball">The very best exercise ball</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the very best exercise ball ever. I have purchased several over the years and placed them on my conference table. People are immediately attracted to the color and feel. If there are 10 objects on the table this is the one they pick up. Caution: they do wear out so be prepared to periodically replace your isoflex.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-my-first-purchase-of-this-item">Not my first purchase of this item&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased the Isoflex Stress Ball a few times over the years. Mine seem to last for several months, and I am satisfied with the durability considering the price. When you think of how the Stress Ball is used, I expect that it will not last forever.In essence, it does just what it is supposed to do, which is reduce stress. Without making any medical recommendations, I can also say that the Isoflex Stress Ball has helped relieve the mild stiffness that I&rsquo;ve developed in my hands over the years, and for that, I gladly will purchase another one now and then.Also, if the outer covering was thicker, it would cancel out the feeling that the ball has in the hand.Recommended!</p>

<h5 id="and-that-is-not-why-i-gave-it-2-stars-though-i-would-have-expected-it-to-hold-up-a-tiny-bit-better-against-a-piranha-posing-in">and that is not why I gave it 2 stars (though i would have expected it to hold up a tiny bit better against a piranha posing in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lasted about 3 days before my 2 year old niece bit a hole in it. Obviously it is not intended for children, and that is not why I gave it 2 stars (though i would have expected it to hold up a tiny bit better against a piranha posing in the form of a cute little girl). The 2 star rating is due to the fact that when you would squeeze it, it did not return to it&rsquo;s original shape. Instead, it just stayed in the new shape and you had to turn it and then squeeze it again which quickly became frustrating which was flat out stressful, defeating the whole purpose of the stress ball in one fell swoop!</p>

<p>Nice stress ball. Bought this awhile ago and it has still held up many, many months later and many, many kids later.</p>
