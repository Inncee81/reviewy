<h5 id="this-is-my-first-projector-and-i-m-really-happy-with-it">This is my first projector and I&rsquo;m really happy with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first projector and I&rsquo;m really happy with it. I can&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;ve been missing out on. The picture is fantastic, even the black levels in darker type movies are great. We have been using it for movies, TV shows and video games with a PlayStation&hellip;zero lag noticed with fast pace gaming. I got carried away with all the reviews and comparisons out there on different projectors. They pretty much all have good reviews, just pick one and roll with it. I was torn between this one and the HT3050($999), I decided to save $200 and do not regret it. If the picture is off a little I&rsquo;d never know it&hellip;it looks every bit as good as my 46&rdquo; tv and probably better. We are using it with the factory default vivid mode and like it the best. It is lightweight, small and looks nice. I was going to go with the BenQ 1070 to start with but I figured I&rsquo;d spend a little more and get a newer model to help with resale down the road.I have 7 foot ceilings so I made my own mount to put it basically directly against the ceiling. The image is just a hair below the centerline of the lens(when mounted upside down) and can be adjusted farther down. I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to put the screen as high as I wanted but it worked out well. I bought an Elite Screens Sable Frame B2 Series, 110&rdquo; screen SB110WH2($259), really nice screen by the way. I&rsquo;ve added a picture so you can see roughly how high the screen is and how the projector is mounted(picture taken right after screen/projector was mounted,wires and sound system not dealt with yet) I used <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; thick by 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; wide aluminum bars, 18&rdquo; long to reach over 16&rdquo; on center floor joist&rsquo;s. I did have to machine some areas because there are some plastic sections that protrude down on the bottom of the projector. I also removed the rear adjustable feet and the pad from the front foot so the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> thick mount would seat against the ceiling. Honestly a good hard <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; thick wood could be used for a more easily made mount&hellip;it really is light. I mounted the projector to the mounts then the mounts to the ceiling. I&rsquo;m mounted about 9.5 feet from the screen and I did add about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> worth of shim between the back legs of the mount and the ceiling to bring the image up just a little more. It did not affect the image squareness and helped get the screen a little closer to the ceiling. I did not use any keystone adjustment.</p>

<h5 id="after-a-long-in-depth-search-i-decided-on-this-benq">After a long in depth search I decided on this BenQ</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll avoid going into some of the technical details covered by other reviewers and just tell you my story. I was looking for a projector that could be used for my daughter’s birthday party, and as one of the final pieces in my garage makeover, I decided to dive into the mind-numbing research of projectors.As someone that has never owned a projector, I really didn&rsquo;t need the top of the line AV line but did want 1080P with low lag and a self-powered USB outlet so I could run a streaming stick anywhere I could find power, outside our inside. It turns out the $600.00 - $1000.00 segment of projectors is quite busy with competing offers from BenQ, Optoma, Emerson etc. pitching different perks like DLP, 3D Ready, Native 3D, MHL, powered USB, Glass Lense, Aspect ratios, Brightness etc. All of these seem to be spread out over many many models, some of which classify themselves as &ldquo;Home Theatre&rdquo;, and others that are &ldquo;Office. There is also throw distance which covers short throw, long throw, and not listed which seems to be in the middle.It was a daunting new world. For me I broke it down to what I wanted. Normal throw, higher brightness, 1080P, with awesome reviews. After many, many videos on youtube and spending way too much time on AV forums I narrowed down the playing field to DLP because LCD seems to have much less vibrancy in the picture side by side with all the screenshots I had seen. This left a few players and their versions, which can be confusing because Amazon and the vendors sell older and newer versions of the same product side by side.I settled on either Ben Q, 1070, 2050, 3050 or Optoma HD141X, HD142X, HD27. The forums tried to push me higher up the chain but for my needs these were the right options. 3D, DLP, 1080P, powered USB, great picture, good battery life. Check.The BenQ versions seemed to edge out the Optoma versions at nearly every review. While some of the Optomas where less expensive in the hundred to two hundred range and had some awesome features like Native 3D, high resolutions, better specs it seemed that out of the box the BenQ has the edge with amazing quality.In the end, the price different was only negligible between the older W1070 to the HT2050 and the 3050 differences of the two didn’t wow anyone enough to recommend so I went with the 2050.Now, how did it work? Out of the box on an Elite Screens 120” It looks amazing. Even considering I am using a Roku streaming stick and the default was 720P, I was impressed, and then overjoyed when I say MLB live with the 1080P turned on. I will leave the spec-head comments to other reviewers and just say that the picture is bright and clear, responds well and is very impressive to everyone that has seen it running in my blacked out garage. No rainbows for me!Oh, you may be wondering about how light effects the picture. When sunlight hits the screen it dulls it considerably, but when I turn on the garage light I can still see a very good picture. I will say that for the best possible picture try to limit any ambient​ light. Also, this thing gets hot so a portable AC or fan may be needed in small places with little ventilation.If your story is like mine know that I spent quite a bit of time reviewing and weighing the benefits of many similar projectors and ended up with this one as my choice, maybe you will do the same.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-home-projector">Excellent home projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really nervous about switching to DLP after years of experience with LCD projects at home, in the classroom, in the boardrooms, and conference rooms. I was looking for a good projector to use in the home to watch flicks with the kids. But, I also did not want to break the bank just to be able to see movies at home. Although a bit more pricey than competitors, after 3 months of use (4-5 hours per week) I concluded that this was an excellent purchase. I highly recommend it.Good:ColorBrightnessFan noise is minimal and unnoticeable with videos playingSpeaker on this unit are good, however, I send the sound to Sonos speakers for better sound qualityI have not noticed any ghosting effectsDefault settings are great. I have yet to configure them and do not think I need toNot so good:The sound output from the BenQ produces muffled sound. To correct this, I purchased an HDMI​ video sound (Fosmon HD 1996) splitter that allows me to send the sound to Sonos speakers.</p>
