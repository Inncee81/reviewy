<h5 id="quiet-effective">Quiet &amp; Effective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had the previous lower powered model in the past which I had used over the last 6 years. With this model I had to use high power to get through my dogs nails. The battery life on the old model was getting shorter &amp; the device was louder then it was when I first got it, so I figured I&rsquo;d upgrade to this model.I have two small dogs, a Pom mix &amp; jack russel/shih tzu mix both with clear nails. This new model is exceptionally quite and can do both dogs nails in minutes. I can run this model on low speed and still cut through nails with ease.I enjoy the extra components and nice case it comes with. Not sure if I&rsquo;ll need them, but still I nice to have.Charger works better than the old model and. I appreciate that it flashes while charging &amp; stays solid when it finishes. A nice upgrade from the old model.Overall worth the extra few bucks over the smaller model to get a nice case, better charger &amp; more efficient dremmel! Would buy again.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-tool-for-grinding-pet-nails-while-the-charge-holds">Excellent tool for grinding pet nails&ndash;while the charge holds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery on this didn&rsquo;t last nearly as long as I was hoping&mdash; only about 30min, and I&rsquo;d say not even half of that was at high speed. That being said, it DOES work. I got this to grind my dog&rsquo;s nails, and it works really well for that purpose. The dog in question had never had her nails ground before, so a lot of the time the dremel was on, it was on low, just to get her used to the sound and vibration before actually using the tool on her nails. She was a bit skittish at first, but treats, petting, belly rubs, and encouragement got her to willingly allow her front paws to be taken care of in the 1st go round. The dremel died before we could get to her back paws, which had to be taken care of the next morning after several hours of charging the battery.</p>

<h5 id="love-love-love-it">LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not say enough wonderful things about this cordless dremel! I use it primarily for shaping homemade dentures and it works magnificently and the lack of a cord is very nice. I will say this is the first dremel I have owned and was a bit timid about using it. Growing up, power tools and workshop things were always handled by the fellows and I was always scared of such things. But after getting and using it for a while.. the only thing I would change is maybe the color! Hehe I would love to have a set of tools in purple.. with maybe kitties on them! I think all gals should get into using these kinds of things as they make life around the home so much more interesting! After getting used to the dremel, I started getting comfortable with my husband&rsquo;s drill set and let me tell you.. being able to do all the little things around the house without waiting on the &ldquo;honey please do&rdquo; list is greatly satisfying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightweight-with-serious-design-flaws">Lightweight with serious design flaws.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s light and comfortable in the hand, and the charge lasts much longer than my previous Dremel. This ability to carve for longer periods without having to balance a heavy drill was what I was looking for.I&rsquo;ve been using this Dremel for about a week now and I couldn&rsquo;t recommend it for female carvers because of the shaft lock button that should allow for easy switching out of drill bits. The button only works if it&rsquo;s pressed at the very top, and it has to be pressed down with all the strength I can muster in my thumb, which makes it pretty painful, and if you have fingernails, forget it. While pressing the tip of this button as hard as possible, you also have to fight the collet nut, which will spin all around independent of the inner collet. It&rsquo;s much harder than my old, cheap Dremel. The second major flaw is that when I hit a harder spot on the wood, the drill stops itself and I have to turn it back on and hold my thumb on the speed control to keep it working. I&rsquo;m carving Walnut, so nothing unusual that should cause this.</p>

<h5 id="works-very-well-for-dog-grooming">Works very well for dog grooming</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to do my dog&rsquo;s nails. He&rsquo;s a basset mix so his nails are large and thick, and most of them are black which makes clipping with traditional clippers a little nerve wracking. It is quieter than I expected, so dogs that are disturbed by noise might be ok with this tool (though my dog is deaf so I can&rsquo;t really say objectively- YMMV on that). The 2 speeds are nice since he lets me do his back feet no problem, I use low speed there and take my time shortening and shaping. He has a bit of a fit when it comes time to do his front paws, so high speed comes in handy to get the job done asap. Little peanut butter on a spoon helps as a distraction.I like the dual duty (dog grooming AND household applications) though I have not yet had a chance to use the tool for anything but grooming. I&rsquo;m sure sooner or later an opportunity will come up. It charges fairly quickly and the charge lasts a long time. I&rsquo;ve used it weekly for 10-15 minutes at a time over 2 months and it&rsquo;s still going on one charge.The accessories all come in a little plastic box, but it would be nice if it came with a case for the whole thing. I picked up a small tool bag at harbor freight to keep everything in so nothing goes missing.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-it-unless-you-re-okay-with-throwing-it-out-every-couple-of-years">Don&rsquo;t buy it unless you&rsquo;re okay with throwing it out every couple of years</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to trim my dog&rsquo;s nails. I use it about twice per month on him. It&rsquo;s the second dremel I&rsquo;ve owned for this purpose but they just don&rsquo;t last. I thought it was a fluke when the first one died. I&rsquo;ve had this one for just over two years and it won&rsquo;t hold a charge now. Go ahead and buy it if you don&rsquo;t mind throwing it out after a couple of years. It&rsquo;s cheaper than the dog groomer. But I&rsquo;ve been advised to buy a corded one. My friend has been using his corded one without a problem on his 5 dogs for over 12 years!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="problem-solved">Problem solved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I originally posted a poor review after having issues getting any of the accessories to fit. I wasn&rsquo;t able to remove the collet myself, but someone finally suggested if it came with a small wrench that this could be used to help remove the collet. It worked like a charm and I was able to fit all of my accessories so I am re-posting my review with all stars and feeling pretty dumb. And hopefully, if someone has trouble like myself, they will find this as helpful as I did. I&rsquo;ve had a few spine surgeries And my arms and hands lost a lot of strength. So if you&rsquo;re having issues, try using the small wrench to remove the collet once it&rsquo;s locked. Problems solved. Love this tool!!</p>
