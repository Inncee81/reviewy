<h5 id="rich-sound-and-a-clear-voice-button-that-makes-dialogue-clear-never-turn-it-off-1-for-including-an-optical-cable">Rich sound and a &ldquo;Clear Voice&rdquo; button that makes dialogue clear&hellip;never turn it off. +1 for including an optical cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just love this soundbar.I replaced a piece of crap Vizio. My wife and I could not make out any dialogue with the Vizio—anytime we watched an action movie, I had to have my hand on the volume control so I could turn it up during dialogue and then turn it down during action.Enter the Yamaha YAS-106 with a special button called &ldquo;Clear Voice&rdquo;. I bought it for this reason alone. I recommend turning it on and never turning it off again. Dialogue is so clear now and the sound in general is so much better.BONUS: They give you a optical cable.</p>

<h5 id="exceeded-expectations-for-price">Exceeded expectations for price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Initial impressions of sound bar after having it a week:So far, extremely pleased with it, exceeded my expectations for the price.Problem we were trying to solve is improve the sound for a TV in a basement room where a treadmill and sewing machine are also used. We needed something wall-mountable, but did not want a separate subwoofer for space reasons. Our previous attempt to improve the sound was to use the speakers in the treadmill (through a stereo audio cable) which helped, but was still far below the quality of the sound from our Yamaha 5.1 system in another room. We had begun to notice the dramatic differences between the two on the details we could here.So some notes:- Sound quality is a dramatic and noticeable improvement than what we had. We do get the sense of direction and surround sound which didn’t get before. Much closer to, but not quite at the level of our true Yamaha 5.1 system.- Clear Voice. This setting was the biggest pleasant surprise. When using the treadmill and the noise from that, use of this setting made the dialog appear much clearer, and much easier to listen to.- Wall mounting installation was easy. Note: The manual tells the consumer not to do this themselves, but we ignored that and did it ourselves. Comes with two adhesive spacers so the unit doesn’t rest flush against the wall, which is something to remember for length of screw needed. Does include a template for where two drill the two holes for mounting, but does not come with the actual hardware screws for mounting.- Cables. Came with a digital optical audio cable (be sure to take off the plastic caps before trying to plug it in), but does not come with an HDMI cable. We’re using the optical audio. I tried to set up the HDMI with ARC (so that the TV remote could control the volume), but were unsuccessful in getting it to work. I suspect that the problem is that I didn’t get the settings on the TV right.- LED indicators and buttons. There are LED indicators and buttons on the unit so you don’t have to use the remote control. The labels are unreadable from any distance, I imagine that I’ll just use the positions of the lights.- Remote. Remote uses a “coin”-type battery not something like a AAA which I would have preferred, but isn’t a big deal.- Bluetooth pairing with an iPhone was easy, it immediately asked if I wanted to also download the app. Note: The app is not the same app as what I have for our other Yamaha sound system.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this because of Yamaha&rsquo;s reputation, the features of this soundbar and the price. It was super easy to hook up, and I am no tech junky. I am very happy with my purchase. It has a built in subwoofer which is plenty of bass for me. It does not rattle the windows, but it adds good sound definition to the TV programs I have watched. I have also played music, and it sounds great. I like the smaller length and height compared to my old one. The sound is so much more full.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-complaints">No Complaints</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very balanced sound but as expected a little weak on the base for my liking. However it&rsquo;s awesome when paired with an external sub! Pleased with TV and movies but exceptionally impressed with music play. It&rsquo;s not going to hold a candle to a true surround sound system but that&rsquo;s expected since the 6 speakers are firing from the same direction. I have vaulted ceilings and the volumn and quality are adequate for my needs. All-in-all easily worth the 180 bucks I paid. I recommend this sound bar!</p>

<h5 id="good-little-sound-bar">Good little sound bar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to the world of sound bars, and I just needed three things out of one:1. Good quality sound - something better than my TV speakers2. Easy set-up and use3. Bluetooth connectivity that WORKSThis one fits the bill for all three. Super easy to install and set up, and the sound quality is excellent.</p>

<p>100% better than the piece of crap speakers that came with my Samsung TV. This is a bedroom TV where I could hardly hear the voices and the rest of the sounds were like an old AM Radio.This is a great product for the price.</p>

<h5 id="hands-down-the-best-bang-for-your-buck">Hands down the best bang for your buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I searched and read reviews for a long time before purchasing this. I got a new tv with a gorgeous display, but the sound was pretty terrible. My living room is very oddly laid out so I can&rsquo;t use my entertainment center for the tv. There is only a very small space that fits only the tv stand so I had no room for speakers. I know that soundbars won&rsquo;t ever sound like speakers actually placed for surround sound. I also didn&rsquo;t have a very large budget for super high end sound bars. But that being said, this soundbar is fantastic. It easily matches sound bars that cost 3 times as much. AND no separate subwoofer.I use this primarily with my roku or tv with an hdmi cable. The sound is fantastic, there is an app you can download on your phone to tweak the settings to your liking. The sound output is unbelievable. I&rsquo;m incredibly pleased with this purchase.The only possible negative (for some people) is that the lights are placed on top of the unit. So if this sits on a shelf you can&rsquo;t easily see which options are on/off. However I&rsquo;m perfectly ok with this and probably actually prefer it. When I&rsquo;m watching a movie with the lights out, I don&rsquo;t have to be distracted by the indicator lights.</p>
