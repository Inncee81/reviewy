</ul>

<p>The Mavic from DJI packs features you once thought possible only on much larger platforms into a compact quadcopter that is snappy, agile, and captures high-resolution images. The drone features an advanced flight control system that draws on a host of sensors — including a ground-facing camera, ultrasound, GPS, dual redundant IMUs, and more — to keep track of where it is flying in 3D space and even avoid collisions. The Mavic works in tandem with DJI&rsquo;s GO mobile app for accessing settings, getting a telemetry readout, viewing a low-latency video feed, and even editing and sharing your footage. In addition traditional joystick style controls, you can fly with simple tap-based commands, and the Mavic can even recognize gestures for the perfect selfie.</p>

<h5 id="best-dji-mavic-bundle-out-there">Best DJI Mavic Bundle Out There!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just bought this Mavic bundle this past weekend, after browsing through different websites and various other bundles on Amazon. I was very impressed! The delivery was super fast, received my package the day after I ordered it. Packaging was perfect. I tried out the Mavic a few times and the video quality is amazing. I&rsquo;ve had zero experience with drones prior to this purchase, but the setup and calibration were easy and quick to follow. The bundle came just as described by TFS Official Store. TFS is a reliable seller, everything was in great condition.Just a few notes.. The shoulder bag fit the Mavic drone just right, but trying to also carry the controller in it was a really tight fit, so I just carry the RC separately. The SD card is already inserted into the drone, so it&rsquo;s much easier to use the USB cord to plug in the Mavic to your computer to clear the SD when it gets full, which happens with around 30-40 min of recording with the 16 GB memory. The Mavic itself is very easy to handle, even for a beginner, but it takes some practice to maneuver it smoothly to get more cinematic shots. The DJI Go 4 app which is used to control the drone has some mixed reviews on the app store but so far, it works well with my Samsung Galaxy and does not disconnect at all. The Fly More Combo is definitely a great deal and really necessary because of the two extra batteries and extra propellers, as well as the car charger and charging hub. Also, the landing pad I really only use when I have to land on grass, to prevent any dirt or leaves from getting into the crevices under the Mavic. Overall, great buy! And trusted seller.</p>

<h5 id="this-thing-is-impossible-to-crash-so-far-the-fly-more-kit-is-essential">This thing is impossible to crash (so far!).. the fly more kit is essential!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> So far, this has been a great drone. The fly more combo kit is the way to go, it comes with everything you need. This is way more advanced than my dji phantom 2 plus. so easy, a caveman can fly it. it takes great video and stills. you have to change settings to get the most out of it but its fairly simple and the entire lit with extras fits into my small camera sling bag. Ill update my review after a few more weeks flying it.(note, my kit was missing a set of props but the seller sent me the missing parts! thanks!)</p>

<h5 id="outstanding-customer-service-and-a-great-quad-package">Outstanding Customer Service and a Great Quad Package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first high-end quad and I am very happy so far. I originally believed that one of my Android phones would be capable of running the DJI Go 4 app, but after more research, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase an iPad Mini 4 for the mobile device. I&rsquo;ve only made three short test flights so far, but everything has operated perfectly. There is a fairly steep learning curve with the myriad controls available in the app and I advise anyone purchasing the Mavic Pro to go slow and take the time to learn.I had an issue with the AC charger in the Fly More kit out of the box, but TFS Official Store provided outstanding customer service and had a replacement to me within one working day. I would not hesitate to purchase from them in the future.</p>

<h5 id="revolutionary">Revolutionary</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The DJI Mavic Pro has revolutionized the consumer drone industry, or more accurately created it. Previously you had to spend double this amount to even get started with a decent drone. The old done came in a huge box and could not be collapsed. And finally the older drones took hours of flight practice to get any kind of reasonable result. Not so with the DJI Mavic Pro.This drone folds up so compact, it easily will slide into any backpack and most camera bags. The intelligent flight modes make it a breeze to fly even for the uncoordinated such as myself. The excellent 4k optics bring home the shot and provide impressive results. Best yet the safety features and obstacle avoidance capabilities do what they can to protect you from your own stupidity. There are of course some exceptions. See attached.As mentioned there are exceptions and flying over water is one of them and should only be done with great care. Many of the safety features will not help, especially when launched above water. Returning to home on a boat that is no longer there will not work. I loved my DJI Mavic Pro. At least I did until I sent it for a swim. Now it is 60 ft under water. I do not recommend using this device under water, it does not float, but rather sinks rapidly. Out to attempt a dive to recover later this week. The dive attempt failed. I have since replaced the drone.The included 16 GB micro SD card is inadequate for recording 4k video. With the stock card installed, I was only able to select 2K mode. However, I upgraded to an amazing Sandisk Extreme Plus 128GB SD card and had no issues at all and was able to record at 4k and download the video quickly to my PC with the chip removed. I recommend this micro SD card or a smaller version of the same.<a href="http://amzn.to/2tfCQbQWith">http://amzn.to/2tfCQbQWith</a> an excellent card reader such ashttp://amzn.to/2shF9Ouorhttp://amzn.to/2svvZi0See the attached benchmark copying the MicroSD I am using in my Mavic Pro. With the Saicoo USB reader it is about 10x as fast as copying from the DJI directly, and 5x as fast as using a generic USB 2 reader. Even in a USB 2 port it is still 2x faster than the generic USB 2 stick reader that came bundled with a different card.Honestly the 128GB is overkill, I was worried about the size of the 4k video files. Unfortunately there is a bit more compression used than I would have preferred so the files are not too large. Still the video comes out great.The camera mode is able to shoot in RAW and can capture some breathtaking views. The attached represent HDR and panoramas created with minimal effort using the DJI Mavic Pro.The ease of use with this drone is just mind blowing. It can be flown in tap to fly where you tap in the screen and it flies itself recording along the way with no effort.I do recommend this set of ND filters as they will help reduce white blow-out on sunny days. They can stay equipped through the initialization cycle which seems to be an issue with some other options.<a href="http://amzn.to/2tfBuxVIf">http://amzn.to/2tfBuxVIf</a> you plan to fly above water I strongly recommend this device, or other efforts to make sure you can at least recover your device. The DJI insurance will not cover the drone unless you have the drone. This recovery device will pop up with a string attached to the drone should it enter the water.<a href="http://amzn.to/2svND5dI">http://amzn.to/2svND5dI</a> also recommend the Fly More combo as battery life is 15-20 min of flight time. It just feels very short and spare batteries are very welcome. Spare rotors are also a welcome addition.<a href="http://amzn.to/2rpw4iu">http://amzn.to/2rpw4iu</a></p>

<p>As a DJI fan boy, not too much to say about Mavic Pro, it is a game change product. This bundle is extremely useful and helpful, especially the landing pad. I am able to fly at my back yard, my neighbor’s park and anywhere I want. GOOO DJI~~~~!!!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-customer-service-wonderful-product">Excellent Customer Service / Wonderful Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After doing tons of research I decided to get the DJI Mavic Pro for myself as a Father&rsquo;s Day gift. I found this bundle deal by TJS and I thought it was right for me so I decided to order it. However, this was on thursday before Father&rsquo;s Day after sending an email to the folks at TJS they decided to send it to me via FedEx overnight so that that I can have it in time for Father&rsquo;s Day. WOOOOOWWWWW that was amazing customer service, I haven&rsquo;t stopped flying this drone since I got it. Everything works perfect &amp; the drone is simply amazing. Thank you to the folks at TJS and DJI.</p>
