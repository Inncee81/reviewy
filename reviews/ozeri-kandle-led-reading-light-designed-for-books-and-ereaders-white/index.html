<h5 id="kandle-1-vs-kandle-2">Kandle 1 vs. Kandle 2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally own both the original Kandle (in black), and now the graphite Kandle 2! I have used them for my Kindle 3.First of all, the only issue I had with the original Kandle was the brightness. It just wasn&rsquo;t QUITE bright enough at the bottom for my tastes. I saw the Kandle 2, and I figured it would be perfect. I was not let down.Differences:1. Original Kandle has only one setting. It&rsquo;s on or it&rsquo;s off. Kandle 2 has 2 brightness options.2. Original Kandle has only two lights on each end of the unit. The Kandle 2 has three (one added in the middle). I have tested these side by side, and the actual difference in brightness is around 30% more for the first setting, 50% more for second setting. This equates to (for me) an absolute PERFECT illumination for the entire Kindle page. Bravo, Ozeri.3. Instead of a &ldquo;switch&rdquo; type power button that you must almost use your fingernail to push over to one side, the new Kandle has a simple large button on the top. Push it once for low setting, again for high setting, again for off.4. The feel of the plastic is almost velvety. The original Kandle is simply hard black shiny plastic. the graphite color is more matte. I noticed the &ldquo;softness&rdquo; immediately when I took it out of the package. Maybe I&rsquo;m just a nerd, but it makes me love it even more. Also, the color is almost identical to the graphite color of the Kindle. That&rsquo;s a plus for fashionistas like myself (har har).And there you have it! I absolutely love mine and will likely be purchasing another for my boyfriend and his original Kindle 1! You will not regret this purchase =)</p>

<h5 id="reviews-don-t-lie">Reviews Don&rsquo;t Lie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one to write reviews, in fact this is my first one ever, but I feel I must with a product as great as this. I was skeptical buying a book light at a hefty $25 price tag. But let me tell you it is absolutely worth the price.First off, the quality is fantastic. I&rsquo;m not sure about the other colors but this particular model has a nice matte finish which feel &ldquo;soft&rdquo; to the touch. The color also perfectly matches the kindle and they look like they were meant to go together.Next the size of the kandle is absolutely perfect. This thing is lite and I mean LITE. It feels like it has the same weight as a new chapstick. For something of its size its extremely thin. Unlike most other lights the clip is rather long horizontal instead of vertical. This ensures that it wont cover the screen on most e-readers. I imagine it would also work great for paperback books but I don&rsquo;t think it opens wide enough for thicker hardback books.Lastly,and most importantly the light coverage. Because the kandle has three, count them, three LEDs the coverage is even with no glare. With the mark II the kandle has two settings of brightness and I find even the lowest lights up the entire page more than sufficiently.Side note: The Kandle comes with an extra set of batteries and a nice soft pouch to store it in. These are only small things but it makes the experienced and product that much better.5 Stars Well earned</p>

<h5 id="great-for-your-nook">Great for your nook</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a regular clip e-reader light for my nook and wound up returning it. The problem with the goose lamp type light is that the clip is usually too large for attaching directly to the nook, the lamp hanging over the nook effects the weight and balance of the reader and the spot directly over the light causes some glare over the screen.The Kandle II solves all these problems. The clip fits over the edge of the nook and is strong enough even though your using only part of the clip (it&rsquo;s really designed for a reader with a larger frame). The Kandle is very light and unobtrusive. Most importantly, the light is directed across the screen using three lamps rather than directly down so glare is eliminated. It also has two brightness settings.</p>

<h5 id="comparison-between-7-different-kindle-touch-lights">Comparison between 7(!!) different Kindle (touch) lights&hellip;,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tend to obsess about finding the perfect solution for things, and this happened also with my search for a light for my new kindle touch, that I absolutely love. I ended up trying 7 different lights, and will post this comparison as a review for all of them. Hopefully others can benefit from my experience&hellip;- Might Bright XtraFlex2: It is, indeed, mighty bright, but more in scope than in intensity. It casts light on a HUGE area, enough to disturb my partner in bed&hellip; On the kindle itself, it is only slightly brighter than other lights. Not enough to justify its size in my opinion. Which brings us to its other flaw - it is BIG. The clip is too large to clip straight onto the top of the kindle. I had to clip it diagonally. It seemed to work and be stable that way, but it is a big beast, and would not be convenient for travel, for me. Given that the illumination onto the kindle itself was only slightly brighter than other lights, I didn&rsquo;t think it was a good solution.- Verso clip-on: Good travel size, very very blue light, not very bright, and it actually POPPED OFF my kindle when I tried to adjust the head of the light to shine in a slightly different direction. And while it&rsquo;s fairly small, it does not fold in any particular way, so it&rsquo;s not very compact.- Verso Arc: Nice form factor, but I found the bright but somewhat uneven, and worst of all (which is why I returned it), if I held it in bed in a particular angle that I happen to like, the light reflected off the top of the screen in a really annoying way. Also, the light was VERY much on the blue end of the spectrum (&ldquo;cold&rdquo;).- Octovo: Also a compact light, but I found it very weak.- Belkin Clip-On: As <em>light</em>, this was the best light of all. It is the only one that was truly &ldquo;warm&rdquo; (more like daylight), rather than blue. I loved the <em>light</em>. BUT, it is NOT adapted for the kindle touch!!! The adapter they send is for the kindle <em>keyboard</em> (as off Dec 2011). It just keeps falling off the kindle touch. With tried it with my partner&rsquo;s keyboard, and it fit perfectly. So watch out for that. Furthermore, it IS bulky. I could live with the bulk because I loved the light itself so much, but if it keeps falling off, that makes it useless. If they ever come out with a version for the touch, I might buy it just to have by the bed, and use another light for travel (see below).- Kandle (regular): Form factor wise, it is the nicest and most elegant. Fits on the Kindle like a glove, and even fits into my Belkin sleeve for the kindle. Yes, the light on the screen is a bit uneven (weaker at the bottom or on the further side, depending on whether you have it mounted on the side or the top), but not terribly so. BUT it has two major flaws. (1) When you close the lid, the light does not shut down automatically. And once it&rsquo;s shut, you don&rsquo;t notice it&rsquo;s on. Easy to go through a set of batteries per day in this way&hellip; And (2), the on/off button is too easily pressed. I pulled it out of my purse to find the light on, when I know I shut it off. So if you&rsquo;ll have it anywhere where it might come in contact with other things, again, watch out for battery issues&hellip;- Kandle Flex: This is the one I ended up with. Again, like the other kandle, fits on the kindle like a glove. It&rsquo;s very compact, easy to adjust the direction of the light without disturbing the base (unlike the mighty bright or the verso clip-on), very compact, small form factor, and decent light. Because the direction of the light is adjustable, it&rsquo;s easy to get relatively even light throughout. The only negative I have is that the light is not quite as warm as a the belkin (but I am not sure it&rsquo;s doable with &ldquo;watch&rdquo; batteries), and is a touch weaker than I&rsquo;d like, again, I think because they use watch batteries. In exchange, you get a very nice, light, compact form factor. So, while not perfect, it is, in my opinion, the clear winner in this lot, and the one I ended upkeeping.</p>
