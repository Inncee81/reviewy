<h5 id="boosts-signal-strength-in-the-country-for-at-t">Boosts signal strength in the country for AT&amp;T</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As an AT&amp;T user who lives out in the country, I have been having problems with my cell phone reception inside my house. I purchased this item to help boost my signal. Relatively easy to install: my brother-in-law climbed up on my roof and attached it to my antenna. I believe he said he only needed a wrench and a screwdriver. For securing it onto the antenna, take your time to point in the direction of the nearest cell phone tower from your provider; I walked around in my yard and then inside my house to test signal strength on my phone, while he used a &ldquo;field test&rdquo; device on the roof to determine the strongest signal.One thing to note, this device uses the F female connector. Make sure you have the correct cable and male connector that will work with this device. Otherwise, you are making a trip to a store.The signal strength around the exterior of my house is considerably stronger inside. I used to only have one to three bars, now I have an average of three bars and sometimes four. I am still having an issue inside my house. I do have another internal omnidirectional antenna and my brother-in-law believes that may be causing interference. Unfortunately, when I disable the Omni directional antenna I still have no service in the majority at my house.Overall, I believe this device does help boost the cellphone signal. For myself, I believe I&rsquo;m having other issues that complicates my situation. For example, my iPhone 5 I&rsquo;ll have no service or a periodic one bar in the center of my house, while my sister&rsquo;s iPhone 5S has signal all day long wherever she walks around in my house. Yet, when we both go outside, we both have about three bars. Thus, I believe I am having more issues than just needing a wide band Signal booster; However, the booster does make a noticeable increase in the signal strength.UPDATE:I installed the Connect 4G-X by Weboost inside my house and now I have great cell coverage inside my home. I credit the combination both for me finally getting a 4 and at times 5 signal strength for my AT&amp;T phone.</p>

<h5 id="i-got-full-signal-strenth-in-the-deep-forest-no-more-drop-calls">I got full signal strenth in the deep forest, no more drop calls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this antenna head to complete a system that someone donated to me. I live in the forest down in a depression about twentyfeet lower. Cell signal on a good day was one bar at best and no signal ever when it rained or the wind blew. I installed the antennatwenty five feet in the air and hooked up all of the parts and pieces and plugged it in. I turned the antenna to get the best signal.I now have full bars with very strong signal even in storms!! A word of caution do not aim the antenna back across the building whereyou have mounted the inside antenna they will interfere with each other they both operate on the same frequency. I like this Wilsonsystem because it uses plain rg6 tv cable.(coax)</p>

<h5 id="essential-upgrade-for-a-cell-phone-signal-booster">Essential upgrade for a cell phone signal booster.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to go with my WeBoost RV 4G setup. I saw a significant boost using this over the small magnetic antenna. When I first received it I just laid it on its side on a table pointing out my window. The power of this thing was impressive, I went from 1 to 4 bars of Verizon 4G LTE. When I have it mounted to my 16&rsquo; painters pole I picked up locally I get even better results.This weekend I tested it out in my car in the woods of Arizona. Service was almost non existent, 1 bar of Verizon 1x. When I used this I was able to get 3 bars of 4G in the middle of the Forrest. This is the best upgrade you can get for your WeBoost or Wilson cell phone signal boosters.</p>

<h5 id="1-2-bar-better-than-omni-direction">1-2 bar better than omni-direction</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>1 bar better than default omni-direction outdoor model. ut I live at end of the world and can point towards the last tower 3 miles away and inside bar rating is 3 or 4 instead of 1 or 2.</p>

<h5 id="great-antenna-with-good-mounting-hardware-included">Great antenna with good mounting hardware included.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great antenna for a cellphone repeater. Working on a setup for an extended family member&rsquo;s house that is out in the woods, and this antenna did exactly what it was supposed to. Now if I&rsquo;d get off my butt and mount it right, and buy the bigger amplifier I need, they&rsquo;ll have cellphone service at home finally!</p>

<h5 id="combination-of-the-antenna-and-a-good-amplifier-really-did-the-trick">Combination of the antenna and a good amplifier really did the trick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been trying to get a reliable data connection at my off grid cabin. It is in a valley with no line of sight to any towers. Spent last night streaming netflix after hooking this up to a Wilson Amplifier. Went from 1 to 4 bars and signal went from -120 to -85db. Combination of the antenna and a good amplifier really did the trick. Panel I had up before worked okay but this made all the difference with the 4g LTE data.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-a-metal-roof-so-my-signal-was-only-good-near-the-windows">I have a metal roof so my signal was only good near the windows</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Booster for my cell phone works as advertised. I have a metal roof so my signal was only good near the windows. This has really helped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="she-was-pretty-much-right">She was pretty much right</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works! Some buddies and I rented a cabin and the home owner insisted that it was a total dead zone. She was pretty much right. We hoisted this antenna up up the flagpole (don&rsquo;t ask) and connected it to a multi band cell amplifier and started testing. We managed to pick up a Verizon cell and had almost full LTE signal.It is definitely directional, you&rsquo;ll need to either know where the towers are or experiment until you find the strongest signal. There are many phone apps that will make that task much easier.</p>

<p>Very well</p>

<p>Using this for 3G/40. It just works.</p>

<p>Good but doesn&rsquo;t seem to achieve as much gain as other yagi&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve used in the past but does the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-a-while">worked for a while</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed around August 1st, worked well for for about 3 months&hellip; then it rained, granted it rained nonstop for 3 days, but has not worked since, and yes I installed it properly&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-about-15-miles-from-the-cell-tower">I am about 15 miles from the cell tower. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am about 15 miles from the cell tower. This unit helped, but at times I still have dropped calls.</p>
