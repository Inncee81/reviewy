<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="all-i-needed-even-if-is-not-perfect">All I needed even if is not perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got my FiiO X1 about two months ago, and for the price the product delivers all I have expected, the sound is superior than my old iPod no doubt, I was looking for a music player to play my collection of music but didn&rsquo;t want to expend and excessive amount of money, so the FiiO was all I wanted for.The first week I got a problem whit it, for some reason when i turned on the home screen turned white so I was afraid that it was defectous after some investigation over the internet I found out that the problem was with my SD card that wasn&rsquo;t properly ejected from the computer so it was read as it was corrupted got to fix this (actually contacted FiiO and they answer me very quickly even if I found the solution by myself before that) I also got to update the firmware that had a lot of good new stuff for the menus.the quality of the build out is great I was expecting more cheap plastic and I actually have drop it like 5 times and all is sill at his place, the finishing is great the only down is the track pad wheel it is way too sensitive and it is way far from the old iPod quality, it is very difficult to navigate with it and you need patience to get the menu to be were you want to be, the interface is not as fast as I would like but it is not that bad .Overall I feel that I have made the right choice with the FiiO X1ii as it has deliver all it promised and the porduct quality es great.</p>

<h5 id="the-good-the-bad-no-ugly-and-a-word-about-itunes">The good, the bad, no ugly and a word about iTunes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this primarily to digitize (or re-digitize) my CD collection. In addition, my car stereo system has BT so was hoping for a nice alternative to the iPod. The seller shipped very fast (ordered on a Thu and arrived on Mon). While I was waiting I started the tedious task of converting my CD&rsquo;s to a FLAC format using a program called Exact Audio Copy. Using this allows you to create music folders which can then be transferred to another device. (you will need to purchase an SD card for this).The unit was packaged very well and came with a cord for attaching to your computer and for charging (you&rsquo;ll need a 1.5v 2.0a charging block), 2 skins to wrap the unit in (if you choose to do so), a plastic (clear) case and two screen protectors (which actually cover the whole front of the device. There is a very brief instruction manual which is enough to get you started (more on that later).I hooked the unit up to the computer containing my music after inserting the SD card. This was basically to format the card. I then removed the device and took the card out and placed it in a card reader (I don&rsquo;t think this is necessary but from what I&rsquo;ve read on fiio forums, this is easier. I then dragged the entire completed music folder (all FLAC files) to the card. The process of transferring took about 45 minutes. I then put the card back in the fiio and turned it back on. From the menu, you&rsquo;ll need to update the media library which will take another few minutes. All of the music transferred and I was pleased to see under the &ldquo;Category&rdquo; menu that you can arrange how the music plays by Artist, Album, Genre, Favorites, Playlists, and Favorites as well as recently played.The sound (get some decent headphones!)and versatility are amazing! I was hearing depth and sound I had not heard before so this was a nice way to get re-acquainted with your music. The blue tooth linked up with my car stereo flawlessly and I&rsquo;m pleased to not have any cords however, this is an option if you have an auxiliary input in your car or other device.There has been much written about importing mp.3&rsquo;s from iTunes and many forums will tell you this cannot be done with this device. I&rsquo;m happy to say it can. I have several songs I purchased on iTunes because I didn&rsquo;t have the CD so was hoping I could consolidate my entire music collection on the fiio. I created another folder on my desk top called iTunes music and dragged ( I selected all the songs as a batch)my play list to the SD card (same as before with the card reader). The transfer to the card was much faster as the files are smaller (mp.3&rsquo;s vs FLAC). I re-inserted the SD card back in the fiio and again updated the media library. I was pleasantly surprised to see my iTunes play list there with the rest of my music. Music played great and the album artwork came over from iTunes (i did not do the artwork with the FLAC files as this is a more detailed and tedious process).With all my positive experience so far I ran into an issue that had me questioning my purchase. Several times when I turned the unit on, the screen would go black and pushing any button would not fix it. I contacted Amazon support via chat. They (Kate, thank you!) suggested updating the firmware. I went to the fiio website and downloaded the latest software. The process was the same; I just dragged the file to the card and followed the instructions for which buttons to push to start the update process. With the update process complete the black screen problem went away.I gave this four stars only because documentation is poor. Although this device gives you several options for high definition music (and you&rsquo;ll be pleased with the results) the instructions for getting your music to those formats and then onto the device are practically non-existent. In addition there are so many menu items that could use explanation, but it is simply not there.In my opinion, this is a great alternative to the iPod and pleased I now have something to store my entire music collection in one place in a format better than mp.3. It also gives you the versatility to listen not only with headphones but wirelessly stream and play on a variety of high end music equipment. You&rsquo;ll love the sound!</p>

<h5 id="ok-but-cumbersome-ui-and-lackluster-eq">OK, but cumbersome UI, and lackluster EQ</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this hoping to use it on a trip, and also as an upgrade from my smartphone. The form factor of the unit is great. It&rsquo;s a nice small package that is easily portable. The operation however, pales in comparison to any decent music player app you might have on your cell phone. The touch wheel is too sensitive and hit and miss. I was able to navigate a little better by just tapping the left or right side of the wheel, but it still sometimes mis-behaved. General navigation can be tiring, as you need to back up from where you are to the root menu to go down a different search path, or get to the settings. a home button would help here. Honestly, my 2004 iPod was much easier to use.Sound wise, it&rsquo;s not bad. But if you don&rsquo;t have high impedance headphones, it may be hard to justify using this over a top-tier smartphone. The sound profile is fairly flat, but I do like to EQ the sound based on the headphones I am using at the time. the EQ on this unit is very lackluster and didn&rsquo;t make much of a difference to me. And using the touchwheel to configure the EQ settings can be a bit frustrating.So at this price point, it&rsquo;s okay. If they cleaned up the navigation a bit, and fixed the touchwheel, it would improve the user experience. The headphones I&rsquo;m using with this are around 30 ohms, so using this to drive them over my smartphone (LG G4) wasn&rsquo;t an upgrade for me. But if you have a headphones with a higher impedance, this will drive them much better than a smartphone will.</p>
