</ul>

<p>Style:Nintendo Switch
The Moon Cell Automaton is a spiritron computer, which exists on the moon and has the power to grant any wish. All across the spiritron-constructed virtual world, SE.RA.PH., Servants and the Masters who control them fight for the right to be the Moon Cell Automaton&rsquo;s one owner in a ceremonial conflict known as the Holy Grail War. Now, the Servant Nero Claudius and her Master have won the Holy Grail War and have obtained the universal wishing mechanism, the Holy Grail. They also obtained the Regalia, a ring that proves their kingship. With it, they rule over their once-enemy Servants and start a new beginning on the moon&rsquo;s new world. But a new enemy has appeared before them. And this enemy has something that shouldn&rsquo;t exist: another Regalia. Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star, the first action game based on the rich Fate lore, is making its way to the Nintendo Switch! Many fan-favorite characters, including the ancient Heroic Spirits (Servants) summoned by the Holy Grail, make their appearances, with the series being reborn as a high-speed combat-oriented title in which players face off against the enemy and their army in exciting large-scale action scenes. Players can also take some time to enjoy the deep storyline the Fate series is known for.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, Amazon, stop sending collectors edition items in envelopes. This one came in just fine, but was concerned when i saw the yellow envelope in front of my door.This review is mostly for what you get in this collectors edition, and not so much on the game itself. First off, the box itself is beautifully done. It&rsquo;s really sturdy and screams quality. Marvelous has done an excellent job designing it. As soon as you open it you are introduced to the cloth poster, which is pretty neat, just not sure where to put it ( i got way too many already lol) Not sure the demensions but it&rsquo;s decent size. Below is the deck of cards. I love the quality of them! They&rsquo;re a plastic material that are somewhat see through. You get one for each servant in the game. Then of course your standard game case, nothing special there. Behind it all is the hardcover art book, that is surprisingly packed with art and content of the game. Once again it just adds to the care that went into making this collectors edition. Perhaps the best Vita collectors i own.The game, the little i played, love so far. I enjoy mosou games so for me it was awesome to play as Fate servants since I&rsquo;m a fan of the series in general.Overall, extremely happy with its contents and a big kudos to Marvelous for knocking it out of the park!</p>

<h5 id="not-the-best-game-i-ve-ever-played">Not the best game I&rsquo;ve ever played</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not the best game I&rsquo;ve ever played&hellip; don&rsquo;t expect a Zelda Breath of the Wild or Persona 5 out of this game for the same amount of money, but it is a fun run-around beat-em-up. Probably should be priced at $29.99 and not $59.99, but what can you do. Options are limited for the Switch right now so we need SOMETHING. The gameplay is fairly frantic and fun. It reminds me of any other muso-style game. You vs hoards and hoards of enemies, and you feel like a badass. The story is really weak though, which is a disappointment since I loved the anime very much. If you do enjoy this game, note that two of the anime series from this IP are on Netflix, and they&rsquo;re both very good. I wish the game&rsquo;s story would have been as engaging as the anime. Overall a decent game, but I wouldn&rsquo;t pay $59.99 for it. I&rsquo;m sure the price will drop quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-switch-version-holds-up-surprisingly-well">The Switch Version Holds Up Surprisingly Well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are already many reviews of the game&rsquo;s content itself since it came out first on PS4 and Vita, so this will just be a quick rundown on what the Switch version has to offer.+The game runs 900p30 (or maybe 1080p, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure) docked, 720p30 while undocked.+Very little, if non-existent, slowdown. Solid 30fps.+Includes all DLC from the PS4/Vita versions of the game, unlocked after completing the main story.+Exclusive Unshackled Bride outfit for Nero.+Aside from the exclusive costume, the contents of the game between all 4 versions are practically identical.-Enemy count is not as much as much as PS4, though miles ahead of Vita.If you want this game portable, then the Switch version is definitely the way to go. If portability doesn&rsquo;t matter (and you don&rsquo;t want the lovely Unshackled Bride outfit), then go for PS4.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the story. And even though they have side stories i fond the game a bit short.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-translation-is-great-as-well">The translation is great as well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very enjoyable game! Though it has fewer stages than Musou games I&rsquo;ve played in the past, I&rsquo;m still getting plenty of entertainment value out of it! That said, I&rsquo;m an avid Fate/ fan so I can&rsquo;t say how people who are unfamiliar with the franchise will feel about it.The translation is great as well! They made sure to use terms that are commonly used in the English fandom, which is a huge plus for fans like me.If you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with the Fate/ franchise it may not be quite as accessible, as quite a few plot points build off of prior entries in the Fate/Extra series, including a few references to Fate/Extra CCC which was never translated into English. That said, the Fate/Extra Last Encore anime should be coming out later this year which may help newcomers.</p>

<h5 id="3d-hack-n-slash-rpg-with-intertwined-stories">3D Hack-n-slash RPG with Intertwined Stories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fate/Extella is a stand-alone extension to Type Moon&rsquo;s Fate series, with 16 playable characters. The story describes an apocalyptic cataclysm that the resurrected personifications of many famous historical heroes (Alexander the Great, Joan of Arc, King Arthur, etc.) must fight to prevent - or ensure. Gameplay is hack-n-slash with RPG elements. Visually and musically, the game is a beauty. Replay value is fantastic, with multiple difficulties and optional side-missions. Compeltion time is 25+ hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="could-have-been-a-lot-better">Could Have Been a Lot Better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great game but some things could&rsquo;ve been done better. I find the generals under your servant&rsquo;s command to be kind of useless to level up &amp; none of them were particularly interesting. Also unfortunate that starting out, you are forced to play the Saber main story 1st. I was only really looking forward to playing Caster. There are far too many spoken dialog lines, none of which have been translated into English (probably why they didn&rsquo;t even attempt a translation.) There are a lot of potential servants from the Fate universe they could have chosen but not very many in this game. The game is also on PS Vita which explains why the graphics are very PS3 looking. The game engine on PS4 edition is very stable though, loads of enemies clogging the screen at once with no noticeable dip in frames per second. The gameplay itself is similar to Dynasty Warriors with some strategy elements &amp; lengthy battles where you feel the pressure to kill faster, faster to achieve your objectives. Overall i&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with it &amp; i have to mention i do not like Dynasty Warrior style games very much. The extra outfits should have been unlockables in the game not tacked on as microtransactions (each outfit costs $2.00 or you can buy a pack for $15)</p>

<h5 id="fun">Fun</h5>

<p>Great game if you like hack and slash</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<h5 id="overall-the-combat-is-fun-fluid">Overall the combat is fun, fluid</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are a fan of the &lsquo;Dynasty Warriors&rsquo; style of game play then this will please. Overall the combat is fun, fluid, and fast, with plenty of flashy animations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-on-the-nintendo-switch">Great on the Nintendo Switch!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this the weekend after it came out on the Nintendo Switch for the sweet 20% Prime discount, and the cartridge has been in my Switch since (for the 3rd day now).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-get-tedious-at-times-but-has-a-number-of-redeeming">Can get tedious at times but has a number of redeeming</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality game I give it a <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> It&rsquo;s a lot of fate mixed with the warriors series style game play. Can get tedious at times but has a number of redeeming qualities</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-addition-to-vita-s-catalog">A good addition to vita&rsquo;s catalog</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really a good game and look stuning in the &ldquo;small&rdquo; vita screen, have great graphics and good controls, the only downside is the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-good-port">Really good port</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Loving it, I played it on the ps4 and honestly the dlc costumes are a plus. Wasnt going to spend money on microtransactions so buying it complete is the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-anime-and-fate-fans-must-buy-this-on-the-nintendo-switch">All Anime and Fate fans must buy this on the Nintendo Switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this game is a great hack and slash game, I definitely recommend it to anime fans. and even more to the Fate fans.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-same-say-release-delivery">Love the same say release delivery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the same say release delivery. Game is cool if you are a fan of the series. It could be a little more visually appealing, but its a simple beat them up style game.</p>

<p>I Love this game! Super fun. It&rsquo;s got a lot to it. Very good gameplay, sharp colors and graphics, a bunch of characters too.</p>
