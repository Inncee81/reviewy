<h5 id="works-well-for-pool-floats-and-air-mattresses-but-i-think-the-price-is-a-bit-steep-considering-it-s-not-a-high-powered-unit">Works well for pool floats and air mattresses but I think the price is a bit steep considering it&rsquo;s not a high powered unit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very small, thus very portable electric air pump. I was not expecting much out of it but my intended purpose for it is for float toys for the pool and twin size air mattresses for camping. I was surprised that it did a pretty decent job on a good size pool floating lounge chair. It took about 5 minutes to inflate which is faster than I expected. I love that it has ac/dc power as well as a cigarette lighter adapter which makes it convenient to use for camping. My only complaint is that the power cord is quite short so you have to be really close to an outlet. I&rsquo;m not sure how well that will work when using the cigarette lighter in a car for inflating a twin size mattress, could be quite awkward. All in all, performs well but I think the price is a little high considering it&rsquo;s not a high power unit.</p>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">Exactly what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This pump is perfect. I knew someone that had one just like this and so I ordered it. I love that it can be charged and then used cordless. There have been many times when blowing up an air mattress that I had to be creative when using my corded pump. With this one, I don&rsquo;t need to do that. Plus, my husband likes to take overnight biking trips and carry a tent with him. This pump helps so he can blow up an air mattress without electricity.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-wall-and-car-plug-is-nice-3-different-nozzles">Works great. Wall and car plug is nice. 3 different nozzles.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently bought a sea doo and I needed a pump to have with me in case I want to fill up a tube to tow. One thing that I liked about this one is that it comes with both a wall plug and a car plug. Most of the time I will just plug it into my car at the boat launch, but it is nice to have the wall adapter as well in case I ever need to use it to inflate a blow up mattress or something of the like. While it is a fairly standard feature, I like that the pump can inflate as well as deflate in a hurry. This pump works well and inflates things very quickly; much faster than pumps that have a battery. Also included are several different sized nozzles for use with tubes or rafts, etc. One downside to this product is that they only push on as opposed to some others that twist and lock in place. They still had no problem staying on, but it is a simple feature that could be added. The other reason that I took one star off is because the box that it comes in was basically falling apart upon arrival. I was hoping to keep it in the box, but now I have to duct tape it to ensure that it stays together and nothing falls out. I would still recommend it because it is a good price and works well.</p>

<h5 id="good-electric-pumper">Good electric pumper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this electric portable air pumper because I have many product that inflate for summertime. I have a small little baby pool, also have a little inflatable float for the swimming pool, and some other baby stuff that I need to inflate. So every time when I pump it up it takes a lot of time and a lot of energy. So I found this electric air pump or to resolve this problem.This electric air pump or is made of mostly plastic, and has a AC adapter, and a car adapter to plug in your car to pump up stuff. It only came with three heads which is probably not enough for all the other items to pump up with, but it will have to do for now. This pump or is a lot better than me using the manual pump to inflate everything. Saves me a lot of time and pumps a lot quicker. Will definitely make good use of this in the future</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="use-it-at-home-or-camping">Use it at home or camping.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The air pump arrived just in time for the weekend visitors. The little pump is pretty strong literally took less then 2 minutes to fill up a full size air mattress.Deflating you just plug the opposite hole on top and will suck the air out but I feel it is faster just to roll up my mattress even quicker.I like how this air pump comes both with a 110v wall plug and a 12v car cigarette plug. Most on the markets are either cigarette adaptor for car or battery and if you have visitor at home adaptor doesn&rsquo;t help so this 110v wall adaptor works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product. Comes with different sized attachments for small to larger openings and they&rsquo;re all connected so you won&rsquo;t lose one. Has an AC adapter so you can use it at home or a DC adapter so you can use it in the car. This is perfect to take on the boat to blow up water toys this summer! You can use it to inflate as well as deflate. Love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="favorite-air-pump-i-have-owned">Favorite air pump I have owned</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I needed. I ended up returning the other one I bought as I felt this one was a much better deal. I like the option of being able to plug into wall or into vehicle. Making this an amazing product to have on hand for all of your inflatable devices! I would recommend to others as it had a fast fill time and is portable</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="slow-but-works">Slow but works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Low power but better than a hand pump because it&rsquo;s easier. If your using this pump it&rsquo;s because you have something large to fill up with air so be prepared to wait a while as it fills up with air slowly. What&rsquo;s nice is the compact small size which is easy for traveling and it comes with a car power adapter so when we go to the beach we can inflate our raft in the parking lot preventing us from losing trunk space carrying it already inflated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lightweight-and-easy-to-use">Lightweight and easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lightweight and easy to use. Worked great for our camping trip to fill up the air mattress in less than five minutes. I&rsquo;m very satisfied.</p>
