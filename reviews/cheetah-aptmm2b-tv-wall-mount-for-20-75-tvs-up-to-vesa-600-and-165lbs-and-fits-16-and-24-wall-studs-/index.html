<h5 id="easy-to-install-very-sturdy-affordable-mount-for-flat-screen-tvs">Easy to install - Very Sturdy, Affordable Mount for Flat Screen TVs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the 2nd Cheetah TV Wall Mount that I have purchased. This one was purchased for my Vizio E-50 TV (50&rdquo;). The mount comes with everything you need to install for various VESA mount configurations. What I recommend you use with the install is a stud finder, drill, and associated bit/screw bit.I also installed the Datacomm 50-3323-WH-KIT behind the TV for cable management so that I could run the include 10&rsquo; HDMI cable and power inside the wall versus having the cables hang down from the TV. You can&rsquo;t beat this mount for the price; it&rsquo;s sturdy and the viewing angle is adjustable. Because it&rsquo;s in my bedroom, I do have it an angle, which puts the top of the TV about 4.25 inches from the wall. Even at this angle, you can&rsquo;t see any of the cables as you enter the room (the include velcro cable management ties work perfectly.Like most Amazon shoppers, I count on honest, unbiased reviews. I hope you have found this review helpful in making your purchase decision.</p>

<h5 id="the-more-expensive-wall-mounts-are-overkill">The more expensive wall mounts are overkill!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I rarely write reviews, but I have been installing HDTVs for over 5 years and I am constantly getting questions from people asking which wall mount they should buy. Without exception, I refer them to Amazon and Cheetah Mounts. I&rsquo;ve used over a dozen of these mounts for installations, and other than the built-in level being NOT trustworthy, this is a great mount and should work for just about any TV in the 32-65&rdquo; range. I have used this to mount anything from lighter LCD/LED displays to large heavier plasma TV&rsquo;s and it supports all of them just fine. I have also used other expensive wall mounts in the past and so I can provide a comparative review.A lot of the reviews say the Cheetah mount looks cheap or flimsy. In comparison to the more expensive mounts, I would agree with that observation. However, when you understand the physics of what the wall mount is actually doing, you&rsquo;ll realize that a bulkier mount really isn&rsquo;t giving you much additional support in a fixed or tilt mount application. That&rsquo;s because contrary to popular opinion, the wall mount isn&rsquo;t really carrying the entire weight of your TV - in fact, with the exception of articulating arm mounts, it&rsquo;s actually not even carrying a majority of it. When the back bracket is installed across two studs (which is absolutely the way it should be done) and the bolts are firmly attached, the bracket, wallboard, and studs become tied together as one cohesive unit. This allows maximum load transfer between the wall mount and the studs, which leaves the studs bearing most of the weight. This concept applies the same whether you use a Cheetah mount or a more expensive mount.I am not saying that the more expensive mounts that use thicker gauge steel aren&rsquo;t stronger than the Cheetah Mount. I would definitely wager that in a side-by-side test with increasing weights, the Cheetah Mount would probably fail before any of the other mounts I have worked with just based on the gauge of steel differences. But, we&rsquo;re not talking about hanging your Ford Focus on the wall&hellip;we&rsquo;re talking about hanging a flat-panel TV and at the end of the day, the mount either holds your TV on the wall or it doesn&rsquo;t. And, the Cheetah Mount does a fine job doing that. This particular Cheetah mount is rated for 32&rdquo;-65&rdquo; TV&rsquo;s up to 165 lbs, and I cannot attest to the validity of that because you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to find any flat-panel display that comes even close to 165 lbs. The heaviest TV I have ever mounted in the 32&rdquo; - 65&rdquo; range is a 65&rdquo; Panasonic plasma that weighed 100 lbs, and that is considered to be one of the heaviest TV&rsquo;s out there. This mount handled that TV perfectly fine.A few pieces of advice regarding working with the Cheetah Mount:1) As mentioned, do not trust the level that is built into the bracket - I have had some that were OK and some that were way off. The separate 6-inch level that is included is sufficient, but if you have a 2-ft or 4-ft level, you&rsquo;ll be most assured of being level.2) If you don&rsquo;t have a stud finder, invest in one (you can use the money you saved buying this bracket vs. a more expensive one). If you have a stud finder, make sure the batteries are good. The bolts used to attach the bracket to the wall are large, so you want to hit close to the center of the stud to get maximum hold.3) Connect the cables to the TV before hanging it. You may have to have a 3rd person connect the cables just as you are raising the TV. Once the TV is on the bracket, it will sit so close to the wall that it is almost impossible to maneuver cables around.Long story short, if you&rsquo;re skeptical trusting your $1,000+ investment to a $25 bracket, don&rsquo;t be. This thing will work just fine, and you&rsquo;ll be patting yourself on the back that you spent so much less on your wall mount than your friends!</p>

<h5 id="cheap-effective-and-easy-to-install">Cheap, effective, and easy to install.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t take very long to mount to the wall at all. I probably could&rsquo;ve done it by myself, but I enlisted my dad&rsquo;s help because it was an easy thing we could work on together without getting into an argument. I ended up mounting it to a single wall stud using the huge hex bolts that were included. I started by taking a long screw to make a pilot hole and then just used a socket wrench to get the bolts in, no drills needed. It&rsquo;s holding up my 47&rdquo; TLC flat screen TV that weighs right around 40 or 50 lbs. The level that comes with it is very useful, but awful quality as it leaks fluid over time. The little pull-strings to dismount the tv have a very gaudy plastic cheetah paw on them, but thankfully they include magnets to stick on them and keep them out of the way.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-aren-t-great-but-the-mount-and-extras-are-awesome">Instructions aren&rsquo;t great, but the mount and extras are awesome!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just installed this today.As mentioned by other reviewers, the instructions suck.They&rsquo;re definitely enough to get the job done, but they simply tried to put too much unrelated information on one page. They should have one section dedicated to each installation scenario but instead keep jumping from one setup type to another then back again to the point that you have to keep checking the section title to make sure they&rsquo;re still talking about the same setup type.My only other complaint is that it comes with screws of all types and sizes to connect the pieces that go on the back of the TV to the TV itself. The size they included that matched my Samsung 32&rdquo; TV were too short. I had to make a quick trip to the hardware store to get the next longer size (The M8 25mm bolts were too short. I had to go buy M8 30mm bolts).Now, onto the good. Because my TV is only 32&rdquo; and weighs maybe 15lbs. at most, I decided to go with the small bracket setup which basically just uses half of the brackets. Getting that setup was easy. Four screws was all it took to build the bracket that goes on the wall. Once that was done I simply had to screw the two vertical bars into the back of the TV (using the longer screws I bought). That was another 4 screws and done.The instructions for mounting the bracket on the wall were fine as far as telling you what size drill bit and socket to use, the issue I had was that although the instructions reference a single stud installation, they don&rsquo;t actually tell you how to do it. I figured it out on my own (which was really common sense) - Just use two of the included lag bolts in the center holes. One on top and one on bottom. Once those were installed, the bracket was rock solid on the wall and hanging the TV was easy. Just hook the top onto the rail and push the bottom toward the wall until the bottom latches click and you&rsquo;re done.The product description says it comes with a level and an HDMI cord, which is true, but it also came with a micro level that clips onto the mount, a mini flashlight to help see behind the TV once it&rsquo;s hung, Velcro strips to keep your wires tidy and a microfiber cleaning cloth to wipe any finger prints off of your TV when you&rsquo;re done! I really was surprised and impressed, especially considering the low cost.If they can just better organize the install instructions and add a set of longer screws (as Samsung is a pretty standard brand and needs them), this would be a 5 star review.I&rsquo;d absolutely buy this again in a flash and would highly recommend it to others.</p>
