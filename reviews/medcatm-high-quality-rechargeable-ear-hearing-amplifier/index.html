<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="you-need-to-read-this-review-it-will-change-how-you-think-about-these-units">You need to read this review, it will change how you think about these units</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had something simuliar before and they lasted well over 2 years, I had seen this product before and i know the name as being a reputipale one. I got it on time and have used for 2 weeks now well almost 2 weeks, the backgroud noise was bad at first but i was told by my audiologist that it takes the brain 4 to 6 weeks to figure out what is what and you must wear them everyday in order for this to work and i mean a full 12 hours everyday. I was also told by my audiologist that these units for my type of hearing loss is just as good as the $1800.00 dollar pair they were going to sell me. I like the rechargeable part, because if you have priced H/A batteries they are not cheap and dont last anytime at all. I have noticed if i were mine on the 2 setting which is just about where i need mine i can get almost 2 days with out charging&hellip;now that doesnt happen everyday but for the most part i can count on it. Lets see what else what can i say about the product&hellip;not much really, if your looking for something affordable and need to hear then these are for you, i know you cant please everyone but i trust these units and would not endorse them if I didnt . For those of you that have had bad luck with these i feel for you, but everyone cant get one that works, its all in the odds. Although i would say if you replaced instead of refund you might have been happy. As for price these units can be very expensive and $200 each is not unheard of, you are saving a ton of money and getting a good product; Well ive said enough i think i would like feedback on my comments if you would care to leave them. Oh one more thing DO NOT over charge these, when the light is green take them out you will shorten the battery life if you dont,, DO NOT leave them in the cradle all night while you sleep, you will regret it; what i do is about an hour before i go to bed if they need it; I charge them and this takes 30 min to 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours take them out of the cradle and make sure they are off. Hint: if you notice they take hours and hours to charge you have left the unit on and not turned it off.Good luck with your aids and i hope God blesses everyone of you.</p>

<h5 id="one-huge-noise-with-no-differentiation-to-the-sounds">One huge noise with no differentiation to the sounds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had used an inexpensive hearing amplifier before so I know to expect some noise from all sounds. I would still be using the other but ran out of batteries and thought I would look for something else as the one I was using ($10.00) was uncomfortable. The design was so it looked like you were using a blue tooth and I felt it was bulky. So I ordered this product. All you heard was loud but everything was muffled like you were listening to a loud party down the block with no differentiation to the sounds. You could not understand voices as all the sounds were one huge noise. I sent it back for a refund immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-idea-but-poor-quality">good idea but poor quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>bought this for my mother, too much background noise. everything gets amplified including the buzzy/fuzzy background noise. But this was the only one I saw that was rechargeable and didn&rsquo;t use the tiny expensive batteries. unfortunately returned it. wish some company could come up with a good quality, rechargeable hearing aid!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="defective-product">Defective Product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these for my grandfather. Recently gave it to him. One of them does not work at all and other one has a lot of disturbance noise that he cannot hear anything at all. Would never buy it again. I went to return it but they say the return window has closed.</p>

<h5 id="it-was-not-good-for-my-type-of-hearing-loss">it was not good for my type of hearing loss</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found the MEDca TM High Quality Rechargeable too noisy , the wire dangling made a lot of loud crackling in my ear, it was not good for my type of hearing loss.I believe you charged me for 3 of the other hearing aids, as there were 3 of them in the box and this one , making 4 all together. You charged me for 3 of the other type when I just ordered 2 (making 3 with this one).. Please look at the charges on my bill and refund me accordingly for the 4 hearing aids. I have not had a &lsquo;review&rsquo; em for the other two, I forget what they were called, starts with &ldquo;R&rdquo;.Thank you ,Everything else seemed to be satisfactory.Marian Celsie</p>

<h5 id="depends-where-you-use-it">Depends Where You Use It</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. Some liked it and some didn&rsquo;t and it does make things louder and I plan to use it outside when I am taking pictures, but there was a factor I hadn&rsquo;t considered when I bought it for use in my house. I have a fairly large living room and I recently just removed the carpet and installed porcelain tile and in normal conversation or watching tv it isn&rsquo;t as noticeable, but with the amplifier on, the echo becomes oppressive. It was a result I had not even thought of, so I wanted to take this review to pass my experience along if you are considering this unit. It&rsquo;s not a complete loss since I will use it outside, but it can&rsquo;t do what an expensive digital hearing aid can do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="same-as-msa">Same as MSA</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Another private label of the MSA product. I purchased two MSA devices in the past. This product works okay. Please note, this is not a perfect hearing device. It just amplifies sound like a microphone. Some people will hate this product because it does not have noise cancellation. It will amplify ALL sounds. If you want noise cancellation, you&rsquo;ll have to pay for it.This is a good cheap product for those who are budget limited or if you&rsquo;re dealing with difficult elderly parents that lose and break things. My elderly father had an expensive hearing device but he would lose it and he had a hard time changing the batteries. We made numerous trips to the audiologist. This cheap device made things better for him psychologically. The recharging feature is the best feature of this device. If they could add noise cancellation it would be better. If you want a premium product, look to the LifeEar Amplifier with noise cancellation but realize it&rsquo;s 9-10x the cost. Also the bad thing with expensive devices is that they are not rechargeable and require watch batteries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this for my dad and he said that they worked great. I even did some testing to see for myself and they did even from a distance. Just adjust the volume to fit you so you don&rsquo;t get an echo and it helps</p>
