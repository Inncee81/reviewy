<p>Size:18-55 Black
The new Nikon D3400 makes it easier than ever to take vibrant, sharp pictures and videos and share them with people instantly. The introduction on smartphones changed the way most people take and share pictures and video. The convenience of having a camera phone with an internet connection meant that people could take a photo or video and instantly share it with friends and family via text messages or social networking sites. However, the trade-off for this convenience is a huge drop in image quality. Using a smartphone camera in low-light environments frequently produces blurry and grainy images while trying to capture an action shot is largely a game of chance thanks to the phone’s slower performance. The Nikon D3400 changes all this by giving you the best of both worlds: You get beautiful 24MP images and HD 1080p videos that can be wirelessly transferred to your phone or tablet for instant sharing. The D3400’s compact design means it’s easy to take anywhere and the swappable NIKKOR lens system allows users to tailor the camera to the shooting environment. This particular camera includes a versatile 18-55mm NIKKOR lens that’s great for shooting portraits as well as landscapes.</p>

<p>Bundle Includes:
• Nikon D3400 DX-Format 24.2MP DSLR Camera with 18-55mm Lens (Black)
• Focus FC-3000 Digital Slave Flash
• Universal Wireless Shutter Release
• Transcend TS16GSDHC10 Premium High Speed Class 10 SDHC Memory Card
• Sony 32GB Class 10 70MB/s SDHC Memory Card
• Focus Replacement Lithium-Ion Battery Pack w/ Charger for Nikon Digital Cameras
• Focus DSLR Camera Accessories Bundle with Bag, Mini HDMI Cable, Cleaning Kit and Must Have Gear</p>

<h5 id="focus-delivers">Focus Delivers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Focus Camera really delivered on this one. Worked right out of the box. Great camera at a great price! Be sure to bone up on the many D3400 features and how to work the lenses with one of the many &ldquo;how to&rdquo; or &ldquo;DYI&rdquo; books or videos. Also had a question of Focus about their offer prior to the purchase. Sent them an email via the Amazon link and they got back to me, prompt and courteous.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera">Great camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great package to get started with. All items that were advertised were included when it arrived. The lenses are obviously top quality, as was the bag. Everything else was a more off-brand name, but all seem to function as they should, except the external flash. I cannot get the external flash to work on the camera and, in fact, cannot even get it to fully seat on the camera as it should. It&rsquo;s like the base plate is to thick to fit in the slots on the camera.Have used the camera on several trips now and am extremely pleased with the photos the camera takes as well as how easy to use the camera is, even for a beginner like myself. The guide mode covers just about any type of shooting you could want to do with ease until you are more familiar with the camera&rsquo;s operations.I would not hesitate to recommend the camera, and this particular package, to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-and-excellent-quality">Great value and excellent quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great camera, great kit. I bought this camera prior to a trip to China, and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint. I got a lot of compliments on the camera while there, as well as the quality of pictures now that I have returned. I&rsquo;m not a professional photographer, but I know how to use the various modes on the camera. There&rsquo;s quite a few good youtube videos on how to tweak the settings and familiarize yourself with it. The only negative I&rsquo;ve had is the bluetooth transfer of photos doesn&rsquo;t work all that reliably to a smartphone, despite having updated the firmware on the camera itself. That is not a deal-killer for me though.</p>

<h5 id="totally-satisfied">TOTALLY SATISFIED!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been wanting a DSLR camera for a couple of years. I ordered this bundle at the last minute before going on vacation to Kauai on 7/20/17. I read the reviews and was worried the extra battery would not work, the camera would not fit in bag, etc. The camera and all accessories were delivered the night before we left (thank you PRIME 2-DAY shipping). All pieces of the bundle were included. Since I did not have time to learn all the features, I used camera on auto mode for trip and captured some AMAZING photos. Also, the extra travel battery worked perfect! The bag is a standard camera bag, big enough to fit the camera, extra lenses, extra battery and some small items. At some point, I will probably buy a backpack bag, but for the price, this bundle is perfect! I also went to Best Buy to see if they would price match so I could take camera immediately but they only price match if the seller is AMAZON. Thank you Focus Camera, I am very happy with this purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-package-for-the-price">Great package for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great package. The accessories fit the normal lens. There&rsquo;s an included HDMI/miniHDMI cable for downloading to a PC. An extra battery is included that is compatible. The Focus battery included is not compatible, not sure why it&rsquo;s included. The D3400 is just what I was looking for. Small and light. Have only played around with it so far, but everything checks out as far as I can tell. So far I&rsquo;m happy with the purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-money-and-the-service-is-great">Worth the money and the service is great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of un-needed stuff in the kit, but overall well worth the cost just for the camera and 2 lenses. There was a problem with one of the 2 extra batteries in the kit and Focus immediately sent a replacement with no hassle at all. Very pleased with camera, service and support from Focus Camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bad-decision">Bad decision</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My initial impression is that I made a good decision. However, I&rsquo;m finding out that this model was a bad choice because it is very difficult to find any accessories for it. This is an entry-level camera so Nikon doesn&rsquo;t even make a compatible speed-light (flash) for it. The one that comes with this kit is basically junk. for about the same price as this camera, you can get one that Nikon considers a real camera, like a D3200 or a D3300.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-camera-package">Awesome Camera Package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this camera package as a birthday gift. I love that the camera came with all of the extras such as the bag (which is a really nice quality bag) the filters, lens&rsquo; back up batter and travel charger (I had read previously that the camera wouldn&rsquo;t recognize a non Nikon brand battery - so I waited almost 30 days before trying it. Tried it today and it works just as well as the original. This was/is a great deal with a lot of the needed necessities already included. I can&rsquo;t wait to go explore!</p>

<h5 id="i-button-gets-stuck-nikon-refuses-to-cover-on-warranty">“i” button gets stuck, Nikon refuses to cover on warranty.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>“i” button on the back became stuck while cycling through the options. This button has always been a little tricky because there is no real feel to the button when pressed.</p>
