<h5 id="the-apple-electric-toothbrush">THE APPLE ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>2014</sub>: After two years of use, the power button on the handle had become so unresponsive to operate, that it required a very forceful two-thumb push to turn on my toothbrush. I contacted Philips via their website, using their online assistant, and a replacement handle was shipped to me the same day. I simply had to return mine in the same box as the replacement, and Philips paid the return shipping. How easy was that?! My two year warranty had actually expired one month prior (isn&rsquo;t that always the way it goes?) but it turns out that because I registered my toothbrush&ndash;which I didn&rsquo;t even remember doing&ndash;the warranty got extended by an additional six months. Great customer service, Philips!ORIGINAL REVIEW: Funny, i don&rsquo;t remember reading that Jonny Ive was moonlighting over at Philips. But this is their second new dental product in a row&ndash;the first being the AirFloss&ndash;that might lead you to think that Sonicare design was now being done by Apple. And I mean that in the most complimentary way. This is, without question, the most modern and elegantly designed electric toothbrush on the market today, and I can only compare holding it to the feeling you get when you hold an Apple product. But is it worth the premium price being charged for it?THE ANSWER IS YES, IF&hellip;1) You have money to splurge a bit and value great design very highly. The ceramic feel of the power handle (though not actually ceramic), the hidden areas that illuminate to indicate mode and battery status, the brilliance of a travel case that both closes magnetically and charges the power handle via USB cable from your computer or the included USB power adapter&ndash;the whole package has just been thought through with incredible attention to detail. There&rsquo;s even an alternative to the one feature I didn&rsquo;t like, which was the charging glass&ndash;it looked too big and clunky in photos, which is exactly how it looks when you actually see it. Plus, do we really need to mimic the old, unsanitary practice of standing wet toothbrushes up in a glass to store them? Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a much smaller and more elegant charging stand included that can be used instead of the glass. You never see that in photos of this toothbrush, and I was very pleased.2) You don&rsquo;t care if the premium price buys you no functional or performance advantage of any type over cheaper models in the Sonicare line. You know you&rsquo;re paying for the design, and you&rsquo;re fine with it. (Yes, I agree that the DiamondClean brush heads ARE a notable improvement, but they can be used on other, less expensive Sonicare models. See below.)THE ANSWER IS NO, IF&hellip;1) You expect a premium price to buy you better functionality and performance over less expensive models. The DiamondClean toothbrush doesn&rsquo;t, trust me. Ignore most of the five star review hype that you read about this brush (&ldquo;Cleanest Teeth EVER!&rdquo;) and focus on these facts:a) The power handle, which is the heart of any electric toothbrush, is just the FlexCare+ handle with a different skin on it. Specs are identical and&ndash;if you go to a store and hold them side by side&ndash;you&rsquo;ll see that size, shape and weight are the same. Only the elegant, ceramic-like skin on the DiamondClean model, with it&rsquo;s hidden lights, is different.b) While the DiamondClean brushes DO clean somewhat better than older Sonicare brush heads, you can use DiamondClean brushes on some of the older, cheaper Sonicare models like FlexCare. Since the power handles are essentially no different, the cleaning you get will be the same.2) It drives you crazy to pay more and actually get less for your money. As others have pointed out, the DiamondClean doesn&rsquo;t have the UV sanitizer of the less expensive FlexCare models. And I just saw a Costco special that included two Sonicare power handles, two chargers, two travel cases, plus four brush heads that included two DiamondClean ones&hellip; all for $120.3) Design just isn&rsquo;t that important to you.The value of great design is very much a personal decision. While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities. But either way, I thank you for taking the time to read my review. and I hope you found it &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; in making your purchasing decision!UPDATES: The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it. The section below contains more on the pros and cons I&rsquo;ve experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:PROS: 1) The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.CONS: 1) No vent holes in the travel case, made worse by its form-fitting plastic interior. So if you pack the brush head while damp&ndash;which often happens when traveling&ndash;it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space&ndash;the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth. 2) When a second family member recently joined me in using the DiamondClean, I suddenly realized that there&rsquo;s no storage for multiple brush heads. (Except in the travel case.) Plus, there&rsquo;s no system for color-coding the heads for different family members. Bottom line: you have to store multiple brush heads in a medicine cabinet or elsewhere and somehow color code them yourself.</p>

<p>I really wanted to give this toothbrush 5 stars, but I just couldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not a bad device by any means but it&rsquo;s partly a step backwards from the Flexcare+ model and is it really worth the price?Let me start off by saying this is the 4th Sonicare Toothbrush I&rsquo;ve owned. I had the Essence, than the Flexcare, than the Flexcare+ and now the DiamondClean.If you have the Flexcare or the Flexcare+ do you really need to upgrade to this model? Probably not, Sonicare&rsquo;s own website states you get a 44% better clean using the new DiamondClean heads, so the handle obviously makes no difference.Don&rsquo;t get me wrong the new handle is very cool, slick design, even slicker charging options, but did Sonicare have to remove features to do this? For instance:The battery icon is now 1 solid icon rather than 3 different slices, now you can&rsquo;t tell when the battery is getting low.The button to change modes was removed, now there is one button for power and mode changing, this means unless you want to splatter toothpaste all over your mirror you need to change the mode in your mouth while trying to squint at the brush to see what mode it&rsquo;s on.Why was the UV cleaner removed? Ok, I really didn&rsquo;t use this often but it was cool to know I had it.This toothbrush is very expensive, and your basically paying for the cool charging technology, and the absurdly overpriced new brush heads. Currently a pack of 3 runs almost $35. In contrast a pack of 7 ProResults can be had at a big name Warehouse store for around $40.Also while putting your toothbrush in the cup for charging is cool, is that really practical? If anything it&rsquo;s going to start making the bottom of the handle sort of gross, how many germs collect in that cup overnight unless you clean it every day.So in conclusion, cool charging technology does not take the place of convenience features.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really really love this toothbrush, I bought one each for myself and my husband. I&rsquo;ve had it for over a month, and this morning I saw the upper part BURNED!!! I wasn&rsquo;t charging it, it was just on the table. I&rsquo;m so afraid now what if it caused a fire while we were asleep. I&rsquo;m grateful for Amazon for having me return it with full refund despite it&rsquo;s been out of the returning window. But for Sonicare, please investigate this. This is not safe!!!</p>

<h5 id="great-product-awesome-customer-service">Great product! Awesome customer service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first review I have ever written about a product I have purchased on Amazon. Phillips impressed me so much that I felt compelled to do so. I purchased this toothbrush a year ago at the recommendation of my dentist. Since then I have been extremely pleased with it as it is easy to operate and always makes my teeth feeling very clean. There was also a noticeable difference when I went to my dentist again for a check up and cleaning 6 months later.However, a couple days ago the toothbrush was out of juice despite having been on the charger all night. I tried the travel charger and different outlets and still, it would not charge. I was quite upset as this was the most expensive toothbrush I have ever bought.So, I set aside 20-30 minutes out of my day to call Phillips about the issue because from experience, that is a minimum when calling any customer service department. And, I was prepared with my proof of purchase and fully expected to wait on hold, then be interrogated about what was wrong, how I was using it, where I store it, etc. But, to my surprise, I was connected immediately to a live rep without having to navigate through 10 minutes of prompts and press this and press that. When the rep came on, she was very nice and very helpful. She asked me for the serial number and what was wrong. Five minutes later they were sending me a new one and an email confirmation was in my inbox before I even got off the phone with her!I&rsquo;m not upset the thing stopped working. It happens. I was extremely impressed by how they handled it and that the process was completely painless.Kudos Phillips!!</p>
