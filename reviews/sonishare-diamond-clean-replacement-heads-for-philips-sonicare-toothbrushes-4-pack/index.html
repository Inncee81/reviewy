<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-alternative-to-the-pricey-originals">A+ alternative to the pricey originals!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried many different SoniCare replacement tooth brush heads, mainly because the brand name tooth brush heads are exorbitantly expensive, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem that this simple product should cost that much. Unfortunately, what I have found is that most of the replacement heads suffer from one of two problems: (1) poor bristle attachment, ie. bristles falling out - often times into your mouth - after just one or two days, and (2) longevity, ie. the tooth brush head has a noticeable difference in cleaning performance after just 2-3 weeks, as the bristles begin to fail and you can feel particles on your teeth even right after you have brushed.I was pleasantly surprised by the SoniShare brand tooth brush heads. The price is extremely reasonable and they left my teeth feeling very clean. Here are the pros and cons that I have found so far in using them:Pro&rsquo;s:- stiff bristles clean very well, but are not uncomfortable- very reasonable price- the tooth brush head is quiet - ie. not vibrating against the tooth brush base - as many other replacement tooth brush heads doCon&rsquo;s:- no cap or travel case; I travel a lot and liked the fact that other replacement tooth brush heads came with these. However, this is pretty minor in comparison to the effectiveness and longevity of the tooth brush head - plus I saved the travel caps that I received with other brandsLastly, I have only been using these tooth brush heads for 2 days, so it is still too early to tell if these will have a similar durability as the original Phillips Sonic Care brand replacement tooth brush heads - but rest assured that I will certainly come back to revise my review if I notice a substantial difference.</p>

<h5 id="good-replacement-brush-heads-for-my-philips-diamond-clean-toothbrush-has-soft-bristles-with-less-cost">Good replacement brush heads for my Philips Diamond Clean toothbrush, Has soft bristles with less cost.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good replacement toothbrush heads for my Philips Diamond clean toothbrush. The shape and length of these replacements are exactly the same as the original Philips brand, even the bristles are shaped the same. The bristles are soft enough not to hurt your gums but still enough to clean out your teeth. I would say these are a reasonably price replacement brush heads and they fit my Philips Diamond Clean perfectly and works perfect.I have attached some Image / Video, it might not show up right away. Amazon has since change the way how they process these and when it will show up on the reviews. Please be patience. Thank You.A sample was provided for this evaluation.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-give-full-vibrational-cleaning-effect-of-the-real-heads">Does not give full vibrational cleaning effect of the real heads</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>$10 bucks is cheap enough that it&rsquo;s worth testing for yourself. But in my opinion they&rsquo;re not worth using in the long run because even though you&rsquo;ll be saving money, you&rsquo;ll be cleaning your teeth at sub optimal performance. I don&rsquo;t think they clean nearly as good as the originals.There&rsquo;s less bristles and it simply does not feel like it&rsquo;s cleaning as effectively as the real deal.Buy em and try it for yourself. Just make sure you have an original head to swap out and compare with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">wow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these to replace my original oralb heads which was pretty old. These fit perfectly and should have been replaced earlier as I know know that they are supposed to be replaced every 3 months. Mine were replaced once a year :s With this kit I can replace every 4 months and have a year of clean teeth. They come well packaged and fit and look perfectly like the original ones. I would rather save and buy these than get the original ones. Great set</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-travel">Not for travel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I buy these because they are cheaper than the Panasonic brand. These are just okay. They are best if you don&rsquo;t have to keep removing the head for travel. If you remove and replace the head on a regular basis, it wears down the ability for it to attach properly to the base of the toothbrush, and will fall off while you&rsquo;re using it. The problem is that this generic brand head is not a perfect fit for the toothbrush base like the Panasonic brand ones are.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sadly-i-must-leave-a-negative-review-i-know">Sadly I must leave a negative review. I know &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly I must leave a negative review. I know this is not the actual head for my toothbrush but was advertised to be equivalent. It fit but after a while the head just comes off as you brush your teeth. Very frustrating and made me dread brushing my teeth. I have decided to buy the actual heads for my toothbrush going forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sonishare-performs-as-well-as-sonicare-for-half-the-price">Sonishare Performs as well as Sonicare for Half the Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These replacements work very well. They do an excellent job of cleaning teeth. They also last just as long as Sonicare brushes. And they cost half as much. If you have a black Sonicare they solve the problem of being able to order more than two replacements at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-it-it-s-not-made-from-philip">Do not buy it! It&rsquo;s not made from philip &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not buy it! It&rsquo;s not made from philip. Brush head is really really soft, hurt my gum badly when brush vibrating and couldn&rsquo;t brush teeth clean enough. compare with the original brush head come with the tooth brush. TRASH!</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-and-very-well-designed">Great Product and very well designed,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product my son is a dentist and he recommended these, glad I purchased. Great customer service. Will certainly purchase again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="complete-junk-waste-of-money">Complete junk. Waste of money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Brushes shake themselves apart, rattle, and one per package seemed to not even work. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on this &ndash; false economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost perfect, fits brush great. Drawback no dust cover!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="heads-fall-off-of-handles">Heads Fall Off Of Handles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Heads fall off of handle easily. If not for that, the brushes are fairly decent. However, I won&rsquo;t be buying these again as 3 heads fell off and were unusable in a 2 week period.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely happy I found these on Amazon.They fit my toothbrush perfect.I always replace with Sonishare for on.</p>
