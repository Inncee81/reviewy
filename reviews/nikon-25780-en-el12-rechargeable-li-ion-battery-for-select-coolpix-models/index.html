<h5 id="the-new-nikon-en-el-12-rechargeable-li-ion-battery-purchased-from-amazon-works-flawlessly">The new Nikon En-El 12 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery purchased from Amazon works flawlessly.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nikon extra En-El 12 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery I purchased from amazon.com arrived here within a few days, even though I selecvted standard shipping. Charged it, also my other 2 En-El same batteries for my Nikon Coolpix S8100 camera 2 years ago. Went on a Holiday Cruise including shore excursions (tours). All 3 came in handy andworked flawlessly when I needed to change them for the 300 to 500 photographs I took.Cost for replacing these batteries via amazon.com are half the cost of what I purchased one of them from the local Nikon Store. They arrived in surprisingly quick time and in new condition as advertised. Have done the same for En-El 10 batteries for my older Nikon Coolpix S600 camera a few weeks prior to above purchase from one of Amazon&rsquo;s affiliates. Received the same results in timely delivery, new condition and more than half the cost of same from Nikjon, or a local store.Since there&rsquo;s no external charger that came with my Nikon Coolpix S8100 (have to charge it&rsquo;s battery internally thru the camera) , I saw external MH65 Chargers for En-EL 12 batteries being offered at amazon.com and purchased one. Same results in rapid delivery, new condition, at least half the cost being offered by Nikon. I used it to charge all the batteries of the S8100 just prior to departing for our Holiday Cruise.Have purchased other items from Amazon and have been a consistantly satisfied customer of amazon com for availability of products needed, reliability and timeliness in receiving what I order, including receiving followup emails from Amazon and, or their affiliates of the progress of my orders from date of purchase thru time of shipping also receiving the items as advertised in expected condition. Thus my experience using Amazon deserves a 5 stars rating.Happy New Year to everybody and to Amazon!</p>

<h5 id="it-wouldn-t-hold-the-charge-and-it-is-useless-i-am-considering-buying-a-new-camera">It wouldn&rsquo;t hold the charge and it is useless. I am considering buying a new camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This did not work for me. It wouldn&rsquo;t hold the charge and it is useless. I am considering buying a new camera. Don&rsquo;t want to chance buying another battery only for it to turn out to not work like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="received-a-dud-from-this-seller">Received a dud from this seller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I just got a dud, but I would not buy from this seller! The battery will not charge and was likely not new as the sticker was faded. I was going to send it back but got it just in time to go on our family vacation and didn&rsquo;t notice until I of course tried to use it. I bought it as a backup, but was VERY disappointed after my camera died while we were out and about. (I&rsquo;ve had my current battery for YEARS and it still recharges so I don&rsquo;t know what was wrong with this supposedly new one I received.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-batteries-neither-acceptable">Two Batteries - Neither Acceptable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first battery I ordered arrived dented and defective. The customer service promptly responded to my email and exchanged the battery with a replacement. When I went to use the battery last week on vacation, this &ldquo;brand new&rdquo; battery which I hadn&rsquo;t used yet, only lasted for about 18 pictures. After the last picture, my camera kept flashing the warning &ldquo;battery expired&rdquo;, and now the camera won&rsquo;t even turn on. In total, the camera was actually turned on for under 35 minutes total.After contacting customer service again and explaining the situation, I was informed that the company is &ldquo;sold out&rdquo; of this battery, and since I ordered the battery/replacement battery in April, there is nothing that can be done. It was suggested that I contact Nikon for a warranty repair or replacement. The problem is NOT with the camera, but with the second defective battery that I received. I will not be doing business with this company again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="are-they-legit">Are they legit?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two since I have two cameras that use these batteries. Both looked new and worked for a short time. Now they both have developed a large bulge in the middle of the battery that makes me scared to use them. The two batteries that came with the cameras are not experiencing this issue. Of course this has happened after the return policy but luckily they were cheap enough that its not a major loss. I first noticed when the battery would no longer slide into the camera. The other wouldn&rsquo;t slide out of the camera.I don&rsquo;t know if I got knock offs or they were just bad. Maybe it is from them being shipped to me during a time when the weather was in the negatives? I don&rsquo;t know. I really need more batteries but am unsure of getting these again.Seller: Shemesh Deals</p>

<h5 id="buy-this-battery-for-your-electronic-needs">Buy this battery for your electronic needs!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Buy this! Off brands will swell as they get older causing the battery to get stuck or not fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-always-have-at-least-two">I always have at least two.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked once charged. It fit as promised. It arrived on time and properly packaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nikon-en-el12-replacement-battery">Nikon EN-EL12 replacement battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have had this now for a while. I take my Nikon camera with me everywhere. I always have an extra battery with me. Takes about 5 seconds to exchange batteries in camera. Lasts about 500 photos. Where the battery gets used mostly is between shots if your walking around, 20 seconds here, 40 seconds there). Still lasts a pretty long time. Also makes sense to get a different charger. The one I bought from Nikon stopped about 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years after I bought the camera. Got a different and less expensive charger that lasts now twice as long and is still working. I only buy NIKON batteries. Heard lots of stories about non Nikon batteries. Buy the best for your camera.</p>

<p>All good except for 2 items I do not recall ordering.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wont-hold-a-charge">Wont hold a charge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It won&rsquo;t hold a charge. Very disappointed. After fully charging the battery and turning the camera on it immediately gives the low battery warning. Complete waste of money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charged when delivered and worked perfectly in camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed and working well.</p>

<h5 id="wouldn-t-charge-my-camera-i-got-the-battery-checked">Wouldn&rsquo;t charge my camera. I got the battery checked &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t charge my camera. I got the battery checked &amp; was told there is a charge (how much not sure!).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-nikon-battery">Excellent Nikon Battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was great to have an extra battery that performs just like the one that came with it when it was new. Also, the Nikon 25780 has the extra feature to show battery status.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars-2">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is always good when you can find replacement batteries for older model cameras, this fits the bill perfectly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as advertised, thank you</p>
