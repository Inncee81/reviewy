<h5 id="not-for-damp-climates">Not for Damp Climates</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been very happy with the brush and the way it cleans but unfortunately I have discovered what seems to be a design flaw that negatively affects use in damp climates. In the holes on the front and back of the brush head, I noticed something black. Accustomed to the rapid growth of mold and mildew in our city, I inserted an inter-proximal brush (very thin) in the holes and withdrew black mold. I poured hydrogen peroxide down the brush and collected the dirty liquid in a glass. The mold had collected although, after use, I habitually shake and clean the brush in running water.All the above said, it is still true that the brush cleans well, never-the-less I will no longer let my grandchildren use the brushes and I will leave mine soaking in a strong mouthwash day and night.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed! I have noticed black spots around my sons mounts while I brushed his teeth last night and when I removed the brush head u have noticed mold, what appears to be black mold!I always sure to remove excess water from the brush heads before storing them&hellip;Last time original oral b was replaced about 3 weeks ago and I could not believe what I saw&hellip;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my 3.5 year old. I know it says it is for 8 plus years but it also says not to use for kids under 3 and her dentist recommended an electric toothbrush since her teeth are very close together and in some places somewhat overlapping so she needs to get them brushed really well to avoid cavities. My husband and I both use the Oral B electric toothbrushes for the past year and a half and love it. This one was considerably less expensive and I suppose it has reasons for that. The brush heads that come with it are significantly softer than the ones we use for the adult toothbrush so I like that, but since we have stock of toothbrush heads for us that is probably what we&rsquo;ll use to replace hers with, assuming she doesn&rsquo;t develop a hate for this toothbrush. So far she likes it, doesn&rsquo;t think it hurts at all and she was especially excited that she had a &ldquo;big girl toothbrush like mommy&rsquo;s&rdquo;.I was disappointed to find that this doesn&rsquo;t have a blinking indicator light for when charging or one that tells you when it is running out of battery charge. We don&rsquo;t typically keep it plugged in and charging after each use between charges. We usually only charge ours when the light blinks red. I suppose I&rsquo;ll just have to keep track of how many days we&rsquo;ve used it for her or plan to charge it once a week or something on the same day. I just don&rsquo;t like to keep it plugged in on the counter since we keep the counters cleared of everything. I was hoping the handle itself had a frozen type picture on it but i couldn&rsquo;t quite tell from the picture on Amazon if it did or not but it&rsquo;s just the packaging that shows the Frozen characters. The design on the handle is nice though, better than no design for a kid.I do like that the size is suitable for kids. Of course that is why it is a kids toothbrush. The ones that we used before were actually longer than this one and those were the disposable ones from Target. I didn&rsquo;t want to keep buying those because the cost adds up for a disposable item and we change out her toothbrush more often than 3 months because any time she&rsquo;s sick we change it. Those we&rsquo;d have to toss the entire thing and get a new one. They also only vibrated and didn&rsquo;t really spin and that wasn&rsquo;t doing her teeth any favors.I definitely prefer this one to any of the kids disposable spin brushes out there. It performs way better, is built to last a long time and is kid friendly. I just wish it had the lights on it. It does have apps to download to make brushing more fun for kids but I haven&rsquo;t tried that out yet. One last thing, the packaging sucks.. it was hard to open and I hate that type of hard plastic packaging that you have to cut or tear open because it&rsquo;s just hard to do and creates sharp edges that get in the way of easily getting the product out.</p>

<h5 id="great-toothbrush">Great Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband has been using one of these Braun toothbrushes for years now and loves it. I&rsquo;ve been watching him with it and wondering about it. I finally decided there must be something good about it or he would have abandoned it long ago, so I got one for me. His is the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; version. I&rsquo;ve had mine for two days. The only difference between them is their age and mine has stars. He wants to trade. When his wears out I&rsquo;ll have to hunt him down a &ldquo;kids&rdquo; one like mine. That may take a while. They&rsquo;re pretty hardy brushes. His has hit the floor a few times and you&rsquo;d never know it. One thing you can say about Braun. Their stuff is usually built to last. The battery needs about 16 hours to get a full charge, but if you set it on its stand in the morning it&rsquo;s ready for you by bedtime and should hold that charge for about a week.On to using it. You can feel the buzz in your hand when you turn it on, but it&rsquo;s not a bad vibration. I&rsquo;ve used battery operated brushes that felt like all the action was in the handle and nothing at the bristles. This brush puts the action where it belongs - on the teeth. It&rsquo;s got some heft but it&rsquo;s not a heavy thing. And the feel while you brush? What the heck was I doing to my mouth before this thing?! It&rsquo;s easier to work the technique the dentist describes with one of these. You know it. That swirling motion you&rsquo;re supposed to brush with. And the head of one of these is just the right size to get those back molars. That buzz I mentioned encourages you to slow down and move gently. No more sawing at your teeth and jamming the head into the back of your jaw. I&rsquo;m decent with a toothbrush, but I finally feel like I&rsquo;m doing it right. I didn&rsquo;t think the softest head was really necessary either, until I had it in my mouth. It felt so nice I worked it over my gums all around my mouth after it pulsed to tell me time was up since it was still running. It runs until you push the button again to turn it off. My teeth feel clean and my gums don&rsquo;t feel sanded. They feel massaged. Wish I&rsquo;d had one of these when I had braces. Ok, I&rsquo;m hooked. No wonder my husband is still using this thing. If you&rsquo;re thinking about it, get one.</p>
