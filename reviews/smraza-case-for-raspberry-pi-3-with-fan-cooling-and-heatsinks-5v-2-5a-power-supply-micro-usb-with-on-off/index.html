<h5 id="solid-product-almost-everything-you-need">Solid product, almost everything you need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty solid product that will get you up and running very easily. The only thing you need to buy is an SD card and the Pi itself. I have a raspberry Pi 3B and I can give a few pros and cons.Pros:-Small-Nice looking-Fan is quiet, even when connected to 5v (instead of the suggested 3v pin)-All of the cutouts are where they need to be, no modification required-There is an extra heatsink (small size) that can either be added to the chip on the bottom or be kept as an extraCons:-Assembly is easy, but peeling all of the protective layers is a serious pain (make sure you have nails)-Fan has no markings, air goes in through side without the sticker and out the side with the sticker-Raspberry Pi 3 board doesn&rsquo;t sit flat against the bottom of the case, a little bit of wiggle, not a major issue, just something I noticedOverall, the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend this case to anyone who wants a nice looking case with a fan and wants heatsinks and cables. I didn&rsquo;t end up using the plug as I have a powered USB hub capable of providing up to 2.5amps per cable which is the stated minimum for the Pi 3B. I have yet to overclock, but I plan to soon, based on the temp readings, I suspect I can get quite a bit of speed out of the processor without much temperature.Update: I&rsquo;ve managed to overclock the Pi to 1.45 Ghz on the CPU and during stress testing, I only ever reached 64 degrees celsius.Tip: You can set the fan at two speeds based on the voltage going into it. The fan that this case comes with is a 5V DC fan, but Smraza instructs you to use the 3.3v pin on the GPIO header. This essentially undervolted the fan. If you connect the pin to the 5v (next to the black ground), you will put the fan at its max speed which is still fairly quiet.I&rsquo;ve included a picture of the GPIO for reference.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="excellent-rpi-case-for-rpi-2-3-projects">Excellent RPi Case for RPi 2,3 Projects</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this case to protect my RPi 3 board. I absolutely love the design look of this case. I did not have any difficulty putting the case together. The top and bottom pieces had protective covers to peel off but they came off quite easily. I did have a slight issue where layers 5 and 6 where broken during the shipping process. It was discovered that poor placement of the included power supply shifting during shipping caused these smaller pieces of the case build to snap off. I contacted customer service for Smarza and they went well above and beyond helping me replace the broken parts by sending an entire replacement unit, with additional heat sinks and fan.I would highly recommend this product not just because of the excellent customer service, but also because it is a high quality build that properly and safely secures a RPi 2 or 3 board. The included power supply, heat sinks and fan only further add to the value of this RPi case kit.</p>

<h5 id="functional-durable-and-convenient">Functional, Durable, and Convenient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Case:The Case is surprisingly easy to put together, though does require a bit of assembly. The instructions on how to assemble it are very easy to read and understand, almost like Lego instructions. The Pi fits snug into it and it feels durable enough to keep it safe for everyday or even mildly rough use. The case gives plenty of space for USB and MicroUSB cables to plug into it, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about certain cables not working with this case.The Cable:The cable works perfectly, and the on/off button is VERY convenient for a Pi, as the only way to cut power otherwise is to just unplug it. It&rsquo;s a decent length for regular use especially on a stationary Pi.The Heatsinks and Fan:The heatsinks fit right on the components with a very sticky adhesive, and so far don&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;ll easily come off. The case protects them from being knocked around, so that combined with the adhesive makes me think they&rsquo;ll stay attached for a long time. The fan is silent on the low setting, and fits nicely inside the case.*Cons and warnings*The bolts holding the case together are plastic, so if you use a ton of force with a screwdriver you can damage them or strip the nuts. I used my fingers to fit them snugly in and it has worked fine for me so farOverall, for the price this is a great product. I would recommend it and probably will buy this again if I need to build another Pi.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-little-case-kit">Great little case kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been through a few kits as of late and this one is the best of the ones I have tried. The case feels solid and looks great.Assembly was easy. The included instructions were very easy to understand with color photos of each piece, laid out in order and orientation. The only problem I had during assembly was trying to get the paper-like stickers off of the pieces. It was really hard for me to get them off using my fingernails to try to get under them. But once I managed to get them started, they were very easy. These stickers protect the pieces during the cutting process and shipping and should be removed before assembly.The included fan works perfectly but is a little bit on the noisy side. This does not bother me at all but may be a problem for people who must have absolute quiet. The included power supply provides enough power to run a Raspberry Pi 3 without issue. The power switch is a wonderful feature. It would have been nice if the cable itself were a bit longer though. The cable looks to be around 3 feet long and in my case, 6 feet would have been better (at least for me).I used this on a Raspberry Pi 3 and it was a perfect fit. All in all, this is a great little item and I will probably be purchasing a few more of them for my other projects.</p>

<h5 id="a-very-good-value-with-included-power-supply-and-heatsinks-with-generally">A very good value with included power supply and heatsinks with generally &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very good value with included power supply and heatsinks with generally good overall manufacturing. The review by Lorenzo points out my same feelings so no need to repeat what was said. Will add that the micro USB power connection didn&rsquo;t fit perfectly on the Pi side of my setup after assembly and required separating the layers a bit to get connected. Also, adding a USB extension cord to the included power supply will not provide full power to the Pi and if you&rsquo;re using Kodi you will get the brownout/lightning bolt icon during use.</p>

<h5 id="good-case-with-heat-sinks-fans-and-on-off-switch">Good case with heat sinks, fans and on/off switch</h5>
