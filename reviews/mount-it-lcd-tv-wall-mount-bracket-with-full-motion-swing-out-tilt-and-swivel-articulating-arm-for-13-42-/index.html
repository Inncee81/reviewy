<h5 id="a-well-made-sturdy-mount">A well made, sturdy mount.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this TV wall mount at a discount from the seller for evaluation.I have to be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much when I ordered this mount. I had 2 smallish TVs to mount recently, one in my camper, another in my basement near my treadmill. For the camper, I bought an inexpensive but highly rated mount from Amazon. For the basement TV, which was smaller, I opted to try this mount. It looked more &ldquo;spindly&rdquo; from the photos, but I was only mounting a 22&rdquo; TV.I was shocked when I picked up the box, it was much heavier than I expected. Unpacking it, it quickly become clear why. This is made from heavy gauge welded steel. For a single-arm design, it&rsquo;s more stable than the dual-arm mount I bought for the camper.The only plastic on the mount, are the cable clips, caps for the hinge bolts, and the pivot joint for the TV plate. As others have indicated, the cable clips aren&rsquo;t that great, they&rsquo;re fairly flimsy. So far though, they&rsquo;re holding up to a few HDMI and power cables running through them.Included is a decent selection of bolts for mounting the TV to the plate, along with a few washers, and plastic spacers. The spacers were a nice touch, the other mount I bought didn&rsquo;t come with any, and the included bolts were too long, so I had to improvise. This also had bolts that were too long, but the spacers and washers took care of that.The included lag bolts are quite long, though I do wish they were hex heads, rather than philips. Even with pre-drilling with the recommended drill size, one of the 3 seized up in the stud %80 of the way in, and if I try to go any deeper, or extract it, the screw bit starts jumping threatening to strip the head. The other 2 went in well, and the mount is sufficiently sturdy that it&rsquo;s not a problem. Screw heads just lack the bite for this application.This mount was a few dollars less than the other one I bought, and seems to be much sturdier. It swings more smoothly. Should I need another mount, I&rsquo;ll be ordering this one again.</p>

<h5 id="2-of-4-holes-didn-t-line-up-with-tilt-down">2 of 4 holes didn&rsquo;t line up with tilt down.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>4 stars because it was cheap, mounted easy, and had a built in level. Lost a star because the bracket seems to be oriented 90 degrees the wrong way. Basically, the TV only tilts on one axis and it&rsquo;s the opposite axis of the orientation of the TV. Imagine that the tilt down feature was instead tilting left to right. This is because the wide TV has wide holes and the wide holes width on the bracket are side to side. They should be up and down, or maybe my TV is funky. I dunno. But didn&rsquo;t matter. My 32 was so light I only mounted two holes that lined up and she holds. Easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband and I are very happy with this wall mount. This is a single stud installation, and he put it out on our lanai. It was simple to install he had it on the wall with the TV within 20 minutes. This swivels, rotates and tilts.This has an 18 inch extension, and 180° swivel. This has a bubble level which makes installation easier. This is nice and durable. We are Very happy with this wall mount, our flat screen is now on the wall -on our lanai. Worked perfectly!</p>

<h5 id="like-most-is-not-very-durable">) like most is not very durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mount itself is okay but the hardware, (screws etc.) like most is not very durable. Product works like it should.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-product-easy-install-and-superb-build-quality">Wonderful product! Easy install and superb build quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this product to mount my 40 inch LED TV on the wall in the bedroom. The reviews indicated that it performed well and was of good build quality. I installed this mount this afternoon and I can say that it is an impressively well built piece of engineering. The integrated float bubble is a nice touch to help with plumb alignment. I had seen other reviewers mention that their product came with phillips head screws for the 3 wall mount points (I mounted mine into a wood stud). Those reviewers wished that this product had hex head screws to ease the installation of the three mounting screws. Either the manufacturer listens to customers or they also noticed the deficit because my unit came with hex head mounting screws which also have a phillips interface on them. I started them with the phillips driver and effortlessly finished driving them with a ratchet and 10mm socket. Perfect! I was very happy to see that this change had been made. Overall, this is an excellent product. The build quality is superb and it does come with just about every screw you could possibly need for the VESA plate installation on the TV, including spacers for limited depth VESA mounting holes on TVs. Just make sure that your TV&rsquo;s VESA pattern (mine is 200mm X 100mm) is among the many that this mount supports and you will be pleased with this fine product.</p>

<h5 id="arm-is-sturdy">ARM is sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOULD buy again! Used for a 40&rdquo; Samsung TV. ARM is sturdy &hellip;no angle droop. ONLY issue IF it is&hellip;the horizontal tightening screw IS behind the TV once mounted&hellip;make sure it is tight enough that you can still adjust to &lsquo;plumb&rsquo; or level. *** Using this mount for an outside TV that is covered WHEN not in use; therefore, the reason for my need to level it each time with a nudge here or there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-our-screened-porch">Perfect for our screened porch!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We needed a mount that we could easily take down and put up our t.v. We live in a humid zone and can&rsquo;t leave a t.v. outside, even under cover. This is super easy to slide into the mount and the hold is strong for our 42&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="plate-interferes-with-cabling-on-samsung-24-inch-720p-tv">Plate interferes with cabling on Samsung 24-inch 720P tv</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I am sure this product is fine for many televisions. Unfortunately because this mount is designed to support many manufacturer, the plate might interfere with your cabling. In my case, the large back plate to make it &ldquo;universal&rdquo;, covers the power supply port, so I had to cut a large chunk of the plate out of the backer.</p>
