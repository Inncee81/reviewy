<blockquote>
<p>When I started TV shopping I did a lot of research and at first bought the 55” KS8000. I liked that but when the KS9000 went on sale I exchanged it for that. One of the main reasons I went with the 9000 was the design (mainly the stand). On the 55” version of the 8000 the legs are about 44” apart. My stand that I have been using for years for several TV&rsquo;s is only 42” wide. So I had to use a large piece of wood on top of my stand just to be able to set up the 8000. This didnt really look all that great, and I didnt want to have to replace my stand with a wider one. And thankfully the 9000 has a more standard V shaped stand that fits and works great on my TV stand.And the 9000 also has some improved specs and also looks better in my opinion. I didnt really like the glossy back of the 8000. Anyway I really love this TV. Ive had several Samsungs, and my last set was the JU7100. But decided it was time to upgrade. I dont really miss the lack of 3D because I think I literally only used it once on my 7100 to test it. And I do believe 3D is on its way to being extinct. Anyway the new thing now of course is HDR. And the KS9000 really takes advantage of that. It simply looks amazing. There are several Netflix shows that show what HDR is all about. And I also recently bought the new XBOX ONE S. Ive yet to buy an HDR Bluray, but I will soon. But as I mentioned there is plenty of HDR on Netflix and Amazon Video in the meantime.One of the really cool new features this years Samsung TV&rsquo;s has its the new Tizen system. It is much more simple and streamlined this year. My favorite feature so far is how well the TV detects whatever device you are connecting and names it accordingly. I have a PS3, PS4, XBOX ONE, 360, and a PC laptop all connected to my TV. And it names them all without me having to do anything. The PS3 and PS4 are both automatically labeled as “Playstation”. And the XBOX One and 360 are both labeled by their full names each. I didnt have to type out names like I have before when customizing my input names. As you can tell I have a lot of things connected to my TV. And since it has 4 HDMI ports I use 2 HDMI 3 way splitters. They automatically switch to whatever source is powered on. So my system is set up like this:HDMI 1 = Direct TVHDMI 2 = PS3 and PS4HDMI 3 = XBOX ONE SHDMI 4 = PC, Wii U, and XBOX 360The reason I am listing these all out is because I want to add how smart this TV is. It switches the settings, input name, and device type on HDMI 4 on its own depending on whichever one is powered on. And I have different settings for PC and the Wii U and 360. I use to have to manually switch the input type every time I went from one to the other. But when I power off a device it automatically switches all the settings and input types on its own.Of course a review of a TV without talking about picture quality isnt complete so here we go. Simply put its amazing. The colors and picture are awesome. It also has very good motion handling, especially if you set Auto Motion plus to Auto. But this gives you the dreaded SOE (Soap Opera Effect). Which I really dont care for. So I use a custom setting for Auto Motion (Blur 3, Judder 3, and LED Clear Off). This gives it very good motion handling with very little SOE.As you read above I am a gamer. And one of the main things I look for when TV shopping is the input lag (or lack thereof). And this is one of the best TV&rsquo;s released this year for low input lag. In Game mode the lag is only 20.5 ms. This is great, I dont notice any lag at all. I was also thinking of getting the Sony X930D but decided not to for a few reasons, one of those is that it has about 54ms of lag. This isnt terrible, but would be noticeable in my opinion.The other main reason I went with the Samsung over the Sony is that I am still not sold on the Android Smart platform. I tested it on a 2015 Sony and it was just too buggy. I have read it is better this year, but in my opinion the new Tizen is much better.Another thing I look for in TV&rsquo;s is a good USB media player for videos on hard drives. And Im happy to say that the Samsung recognizes and plays every single file type I have tested. It also has SRT subtitle support.So overall I am very happy with this TV. It is by far the nicest set I have ever owned and I look forward to years of use with it. If you are looking for a new HDR 4K TV this should be on the top of your list. If you want a cheaper alternative go with the KS8000. Just be aware on the 55” version of the 44” wide legs. On the larger versions the 8000 has optional closer leg mounts, but for some reason Samsung did not do this on the 55” version. Anyway thanks for reading. If you have any questions or comments feel free. Ill try to answer and respond.The one issue as mentioned in the title is that the source list and its icons go blank every couple days, sometimes more. This is a known issue and apparently Samsung is looking into it. As a work around you can hold down the power button on the remote to force it to reboot. This brings the source list back, but its still an issue. Its only the upper source list, the lower one doesnt go away. If you own the set you&rsquo;ll know what I mean by the upper one. Thankfully this is an issue that can be fixed via firmware update, but as of 1131 (9-23-16) it still happens. If it gets fixed Ill try to update my review.Update: As of firmware update 1142 this missing sources issue is fixed. Im now on firmware version 1150 and the issue has not happened again. So apparently it got fixed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would be 5 stars of Samsung didn&rsquo;t disable the smart functions due to me not agreeing the allow the TV to track my interest and send me advertisements every time I opened the menu. Very high quality display. Just to play devil’s advocate I use my Xbox to play Netflix and hulu and all that stuff and my Xbox does give me ads based on my usage. But, my Xbox never asked. So, Thumbs up Samsung for having the decency to ask first! Great Picture though. HDR is amazing, more so than 4k even. However I have noticed that watching movies remastered to 4k is not the same as movies shot in 4k. Its like paying twice as much for a 1080p movie that this Tv would have upscaled to 4k anyway. This TV upscales all content to 4k which is nice but not special. All 4k TVs do it. So basically the TV does exceptionally well, but watch out for content providers upscaling old movies slapping a 4k sticker on the package and selling them to you at 4k prices. Your 4k TV does that for free and either way it still looks like 1080p if its upscaled. Just something to think about before buying any 4k TV as I had to learn the hard way after buying the TV and “4k” content and wondering why the TV looks Amazing on some movies and like garbage for other movies. Also this TV does HDR10 4:4:4 but its not turned on by default. If you are using HDR you need to turn it on manually for the first time. And, lastly this TV does not support Dolby Vision Which is just another HDR format with a slightly deeper color depth. If you don’t know about different HDR formats, HDR10 aka HDR1000 is a more widely accepted format that will enable you to easily set up a home theater. Finding all equipment using the Dolby vision format may be a bit more difficult.</p>

<h5 id="picture-issues-from-the-start">Picture issues from the start.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this TV today &ndash; the folks sent by Amazon plugged it in and said it worked fine &ndash; it does not. There is a bright light shining up from just left of center. There must be very poor quality control at Samsung. I assume this device won&rsquo;t explode like their phone but it does appear that there is a light burning out within the picture.You can see in the second photo where the screen is supposed to be black but there is a bright light shining through. You can see the washout in the other two pictures.Make sure you get a good look at the picture before accepting these TVs. Very poor quality control on such an expensive device &ndash; not too good for Samsung&rsquo;s top of the line product.I will report back on how Amazon handles these issues.I just wanted to add that the remote doesn&rsquo;t work either&hellip;</p>
