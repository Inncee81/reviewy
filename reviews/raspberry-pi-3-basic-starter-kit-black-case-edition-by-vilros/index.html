<h5 id="a-powerful-yet-inexpensive-home-theater-box-option">A Powerful (yet inexpensive) home theater box option&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit was my first (of two and eventually more) pi 3 kit and I can&rsquo;t say enough good about it. A quick install of OSMC or openelec, a microsd card and an HDMI cable and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a mini-HTPC for peanuts. If you have a plex server at home RASPBMC can be used to really bring everything together. Heatsink is a super-easy install and so is the case. My only regret is not going with the clear case on my first order (but I just like seeing the pi board inside). Everything about the order was easy and quick. Friend of mine ordered one after I told him about it and I&rsquo;ll probably be ordering more in the future to try some new projects (retropie). Would definitely recommend even to the less technically savvy folks- it isn&rsquo;t rocket science to get yourself up and running given the extensive documentation available. For ~$50 you are getting a world of fun.</p>

<h5 id="great-kit-for-the-price">Great kit for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this kit to make myself a RetroPie console for my NES, SNES, and Genesis ROM&rsquo;s for which I own physical copies. This kit was very easy to assemble, and the Pi is very easy to get up and running. I could see myself buying the next iteration down the road to do something more advanced with.Pros:-The Raspberry Pi 3 worked without issues.-The included power cable provides adequate juice for the RPi3 to work.-You get a couple heatsinks, but I&rsquo;m not overclocking my Pi (yet) so I&rsquo;m not sure if these are really doing anything, but they can&rsquo;t hurt.-The case is very simple and attractive. The Pi fits securely in the bottom of the case and the cutouts match the Pi&rsquo;s ports.-At $50, you&rsquo;re getting the accessories for essentially ~$13 which isn&rsquo;t a bad price for case, power cable, and heatsinks.Cons:-The case has a cover on both of the longer sides. These fall off too easily for my liking. However, I don&rsquo;t foresee moving the Pi around very much so I won&rsquo;t dock them a star for it.-The case has a glossy black top, which I&rsquo;m sure will get scratched at some point. But it does provide a great surface to attach your preferred stickers, decals, or other decorations if you choose.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="my-new-favorite-device">My New Favorite Device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is a new favorite of mine. It&rsquo;s really an excellent tool, great price, powerful components, great docs from the raspberrypi.org site. This case is well done. Not sure how necessary the heatsinks are in my case, but they shouldn&rsquo;t hurt anything and were easy to apply with the included instructions.One caution, I ruined one SD card trying to put my board into the case. After getting everything working outside its case, I was trying to shoehorn it into the case with the SD card plugged in, and apparently put enough awkward pressure on it to bend the SD card in half, rendering it dead. But I set up another card the same way (with NOOBS) and was back in business in no time. I don&rsquo;t really think it&rsquo;s a design flaw with the case, but the $6 lesson I&rsquo;ll pass on to others is: unplug everything before installing it into the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-starter-kit">Perfect starter kit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great starter kit for the price! The only required thing you need to get rolling is a micro SD card. Be sure to pick one up if you don&rsquo;t have one.If you plan on using the IO header you will also need a cable.Only negative is the case is a little clunky. The side covers easily fall off and the board isn&rsquo;t held down well. Inserting the SD card with the case is a little tricky. All minor flaws. Exactly what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-package">Great Package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 is a pretty awesome toy with limitless possibilities. Each generation of the Pi seems to get a little better so I am not going to concentrate on that part of the product but on the package of accessories. Depending on what you want to use the Pi for, you will most likely need a case, heat sinks, and a power supply. The case would probably earn between 4 and 4.5 stars but is still good quality and not a bad buy on its own. The power supply and heat sinks both do a job and do it well easily earning 5 stars. Averaging those 3 with a 5 for the Pi itself easily makes the package 5 stars. I did try piecing this together to see if I could save some money but ended up purchasing the whole unit because there was no savings at that time. As a starter kit I would buy this again. I did have an SD card and USB keyboard before starting my build.Before starting with Pi you may want to play around a little with Linux, having a few Linux skills makes this much easier.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-that-is-all-i-have-to-say-about">Awesome! That is all I have to say about &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome! That is all I have to say about this. The box, heatsink and power supply is of very good quality. I was in the market looking for a small computer where I could install Apache, run as a reverse proxy to run an SSL server to front a couple of video cameras which does not have SSL support. The product comes with a quick start booklet which initially did not work for me. The booklet is based on using a MicroSD card that has OS installed on it. I started from a blank MicroSD card directly from Amazon which caused the unit to not boot on first power up. However, going to the Raspberry PI website and looking at the downloads I could see the options available. From there I was able to find clear instructions on how to download to a MacOS machine and transfer it over to the MicroSD. From there to boot up and installation of Apache proxy server was about 5 minutes. Very impressed. I initially booted the system with a wired LAN but realized that wireless setup was just as easy. I had allocated two days to complete the work but I was pleasantly surprised to be done in 5 minutes. I intend to use the box in a headless mode but during setup I had a taste of the UI running browser and terminal. I can see it becoming a solid general purpose compute unit in no time and I can say bye-bye to my old desktops.</p>

<p>Almost everything you need to get started. I choose this so I could pick the SD card I wanted instead of living with a 8 or 16GB one.</p>

<p>Power supply that arrived doesn&rsquo;t work. Airflow through this case is also terrible so expect that your device will likely overheat as mine does.</p>
