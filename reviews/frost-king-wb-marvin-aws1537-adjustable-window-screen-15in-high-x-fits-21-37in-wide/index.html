<h5 id="ahhhhhhh-fresh-air">Ahhhhhhh fresh air!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We recently rented a house in NC that has no screens in any of the windows. Seriously&hellip;. 17 windows in the house and not a single screen. How do you have a house in NC without screens in the windows??? Well anyway,we purchased several of these screens to use now that the weather has cooled off and the a/c has been turned off. They do the job&hellip; allow us to get some air into the house and keeping most of the bugs out. The screens just sit in the window and for us, we have some small gaps between the window and screen that have allowed a few of those nasty stink bugs in&hellip; but if they&rsquo;ve let 2-3 in I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve kept 20-30 out, so that&rsquo;s not a bad result in my book.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-and-sooo-easy">Excellent and sooo easy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We rent but found that most of the screens were missing or damaged and hard to replace with the older irregular windows. I did not want to make my own screens. When I compared the price of the supplies to make my own and buying these&hellip; it was cheaper to buy these.I was not sure if they were any good but took the chance. they are Great! the are adjustable and fit in the screen tracks. yes, the ends are unfinished wood (or lightly stained) but for the price get a small bottle of craft paint and paint them white, silver or whatever color you like. They are worth it and I would recommend them to anyone who needs replacement screens at a low price. I just wish they had more sizes in larger heights for our other windows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although my pool has a screen cage, the water draws mosquitoes, and the homebuilder &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; that screens would not be needed on the doors and windows opening into the cage&hellip; Not so, therefore,I purchased the 62&rdquo; x 81&rdquo; Fitlife Magnetic Door Screen for the French doors opening onto the pool, and 10&rdquo; Louvered screens for the bathroom, and several 18&rdquo; Adjustable Window screens for the living and breakfast rooms.. all of which open onto the pool.The louvers work well over the tub for privacy and removal of steam, but one does not get a &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; from them. Thermwell Products AWS1207 10x21-37 Louver&hellip;The 18&rdquo; screens are marvelous, enabling cross ventilation without insect/mosquito invasion. Frost King WB Marvin AWS1837 Adjustable Window&hellip;The Magnetic Door Screen: TheFitLife 62&rdquo;x81&rdquo; Magnetic Screen Door Fits&hellip;This is the best of all. Now, I keep both doors wide open, go in and out with ease. Be careful installing this. If you pull the sides out too tightly, the middle magnets can&rsquo;t operate&hellip; but, if you take your time and do it right, you will be thrilled. mariana</p>

<h5 id="of-these-for-my-bedroom-windows-and-they-work-great-because-they-re-expandable">&hellip; of these for my bedroom windows and they work great. Because they&rsquo;re expandable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these for my bedroom windows and they work great. Because they&rsquo;re expandable, it&rsquo;s actually easy to take them in and out even though there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff in front of my windows. They&rsquo;re a little flimsy, as other reviewers have said, but as long as you don&rsquo;t drop them or something, they work just fine once locked in place in the windows. I&rsquo;ve had them for several months and I&rsquo;m really happy with the purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-a-good-product-and-does-what-i-needed-them-to-do">Overall a good product and does what I needed them to do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered three screens in the same size. Bought them to put in the second story windows so the cats can&rsquo;t push the screens out. They fit nicely inside the window frame and are out of the way so the cats can still sit on the window sills. Only giving four stars because on one of the screens the mesh screen is not fully secured inside the wood frame. Not worth the hassle of returning. I am ordering three more screens but in a shorter height for when we don&rsquo;t want the windows open all the way. If I had thought about that before ordering, I would have only ordered shorter screens.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lame-although-they-adjust-easily-and-the-screening-is">lame. Although they adjust easily and the screening is &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, lame. Although they adjust easily and the screening is attached securely to the top and bottom, it is not at all secure on the sides. In fact, I had to secure all myself by filling the gaps with glue and that&rsquo;s not even the best. I&rsquo;m going to sew the screening around the vertical wood and metal pieces. I checked out the adjustable screen by Marvin at the local hardware store - they got it right so what&rsquo;s up with Frost King?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frost King WB Marvin AWS1837 Adjustable Window Screen, 18in High x Fits 21-37in Wide and it is an add-on idem. Do not buy it, it is not even worth the $7.58 they are getting.. It is worth maybe $2.00 each that&rsquo;s all. The screens in this one where all pulled out of the frame, or the metal sliders&hellip;. and the packing was very poor&hellip; The top three where bent up, from packing or shipping&hellip; Will never buy them again. The other screens I do not know nothing about only this one&hellip; The other ones cost a lot more than this add-on screen&hellip;. Buyer beware&hellip;..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fell-apart-within-12-hours">Fell apart within 12 hours.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to like this. Fit perfectly. Installed it and with in 12 hours the cats had managed to pull it out and remove the wooden ends! The screen never tore but the wooden ends are cheap and fell off. No, my cats are not particularly talented. This is just cheaply made. Returned.</p>
