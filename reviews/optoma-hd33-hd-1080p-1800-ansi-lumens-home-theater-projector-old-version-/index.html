<h5 id="great-hd-and-3d-projector">Great HD and 3D Projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like everyone else, I did extensive research and comparisons before I committed to purchase this projector. I didn&rsquo;t buy HD20 because I want a 3D projector and get some new HT experience. This projector has been performed flawlessly for the past two months since I bought it.The installation of the projector is not hard. I used a ceiling mount bought from here as well. I had to make +5 keystone adjustments after installed it on the top of the ceiling. We projected it to a 135&rdquo; screen from about 15-16 feet away. This projector is quiet and we could barely notice the noise even I hang it on top of our seating area. We connected it to a Denon A/V receiver through a 25 feet HDMI cable bought here, everything else is connected to the receiver include A 3D Sony Blueray player. We have watched most recent popular 3D movies such as Avatar, Hugo, Avengers, Transformer - Dark of the Moon, How to Train your Dragon, Under the Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth etc.. The picture quality of the 3D is excellent, the 3D scenes pop up nicely when it needs to. We used TrueDepth, SainSonic, and some other DLP link 3D glasses sold here, very few crosstalk or ghosting with the combination of TrueDepth and this projector. Even streaming Netflix or Amazon Video through the Sony Blueray is picture perfect and crystal clear. This is one of the best 3D projectors under $2K range, you won&rsquo;t get a decent 60 inches 3D TV at this price.If you have problems to get the right contrast and grey levels, you should upgrade your screen or have your room light under control. Darker or gray screen makes the color pops and increase the contrast significantly. Mine get very decent contrast with a good gray silver high gain screen, my HT is at my basement cave with controlled light. Also, you should change the default settings and make adjustments on gamma levels. See my settings below.Of course, if you have a much better A/V receiver can upscale to dark color, the whole home movie watching process is such a joy even for TV broadcasts or streaming videos. Combined it with our Polk Audio Monitor front and rear floor-standing speakers, CS2 center, Bic America F12 sub, and two Furnace bipolar surround speakers, the sight and sound of the home theater is unbelievable, it is a different experience from sound distorted commercial theaters. It makes us don&rsquo;t ever want to go to the movie theaters again.I have logged about 500 hours in about two months since I bought it, I used it as a TV, I watched about 10 hours of movies and TV channels everyday after my leg was injured and couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I am really hooked to this projector and the new HT system.Highly recommended if you are still on the sideline to evaluate which economic 3D HD projector to buy.Here are the settings I use after read the discussions on avsforum and some other reviews on the projector - tweak the settings according to your screen type use and the light condition in your room:2D Settings:Image MenuDisplay Mode: ReferenceContrast: -24 (surprise here, but give it a try)Brightness: -9 (yours not too bright?)Sharpness: 13 (try higher sharpness)AdvancedGamma: StandardCurve Type: +1Offset: -1PureEnginePureDetail: OffPureColor: 1 (fine here)PureMotion: OffColor SettingsColor Temperature: WarmRGB Gain/BiasRed Gain: 0Green Gain: -1Blue Gain: -1Red Bias: +1Green Bias: +1Blue Bias: 03D Settings:Display Mode: 3DContrast: +10Brightness: -7Sharpness: 13AdvancedGamma: StandardCurve Type: +1Offset: 0PureEngine (you should turn off Pure Eingine)PureDetail: OffPureColor: OffPureMotion: OffColor SettingsColor Temperature: WarmRGB Gain/BiasRed Gain: +7Green Gain: -2Blue Gain: +14Red Bias: -1Green Bias: -1Blue Bias: -13</p>

<h5 id="you-need-this-projector">you need this projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a benQ pb6200 for about 8 years. I had replaced the lamp 3 times but finally the fan broke and rather then fix it again I decided to upgrade. I figured since tvs had hit a peak with 3d and 1080p a while back it was a safe bet to wait for projectors to catch up. I unboxed it and I realized it was huge and my old mount wouldn&rsquo;t work (I over night delivered a universal mount from eBay). Other than that it was absolutely incredible. It works with all the lights on in the house, 3d is fantastic with the PS3, 1080p is just incredible at 100&rdquo;s, the throw distance is very short so its easy to make the screen huge even in a small area. Everyone that sees it in person is just stunned by it. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was missing since I only had 1080i. Native 1080p is incredible and 3d in first person shooters like killzone 3 is so awesome. Some games like GT5 3d is more like a novelty and is still really cool but first person shooters will make you flinch when bullets whiz by your head. I got dlp link glasses from optima and they are great. The projected also supports the new ir format for 3d glasses but I&rsquo;ll wait until there is a little more maturity for that technology before I buy a set of those glasses. Also if you use DLP link you don&rsquo;t need to plug in this little wire and adapter that comes with the projector for IR support. It will be a long time before anything tops this projector when price is considered. In a few years this projector will probable be under a grand, but for me I couldn&rsquo;t wait and I totally feel like it was worth every penny.</p>

<h5 id="like-imax-for-the-home">Like IMAX for the home!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am fortunate enough to live very close to an IMAX movie theater. I&rsquo;ve seen lots of 3D Movies on the IMAX screen including Avatar and Prometheus. I&rsquo;ve also been lucky to own several Optoma DLP projectors. The HD33 is now my favorite new toy. I&rsquo;ve got it projecting on a 120 inch screen with 1500 watts of Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound. Just my opinion, but if you&rsquo;ve got $1,300.00 to drop for a projector, then don&rsquo;t skimp on the sound or the screen size. My friends and I agree, with the addition of several pairs of DLP Link active shutter glasses, this projector delivers a stunningly bright and crisp picture. We honestly can&rsquo;t tell the difference between the HD33 and the IMAX theater accross the street except no one is kicking the back of our seats. Last night we watched Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s Hugo and it was spectacular. The 3D was beautiful. On a big screen it really is a much more impressive effect. I&rsquo;ve got a 42&rdquo; plasma tv that does 3D but, unless you sit 6 inches from the screen, it just seems&hellip;disappointing. With a projector like this it really feels like you are in the movie. Avatar on 3D blu-ray looks good on my 42&rdquo; tv, but it looks like a miracle on my new Optoma HD33. I was going to buy a 60&rdquo; LCD 3D tv for around $1,000.00. Glad I didn&rsquo;t make that mistake. No 60&rdquo; or 80&rdquo; tv will ever compare to the experience of sitting six feet back from a 120&rdquo; screen. No eye strain. No fear of radiation. Because it&rsquo;s a projected image like at the theater and not some giant hot box you are sitting in front of there is no fear of sitting too close. Just get right in there and let the picture fill your entire field of vision. I have also watched The Dark Knight Rises on blu-ray as a 2D sort of test. I saw The Dark Knight Rises at the IMAX theater. It looked great on the IMAX screen. The parts of the movie that were actually filmed in IMAX really showed the difference between a regular 65mm or 70mm film that&rsquo;s been blown up to fit an IMAX screen ( which can be great ) and the sharpness and depth of field possible on the much larger IMAX format. Watching the same movie again on my HD33 I got the same giddy feeling of flying during some of the helicopter shots of Gotham City. I honestly can&rsquo;t see much difference between what I saw at the IMAX Theater and what I now have at home. Couldn&rsquo;t be happier!Six months later I am amending this review.For technically the best picture make sure your room is dark. No outside light from windows. No brightly painted white walls. There is a reason theaters are all done up in black and dark red. So as not to throw too much reflected light back onto the screen.After watching dozens of different 3D blu ray movies including The Hobbit, Life of Pi, Titanic and The Avengers just to name a few I can honestly say that this projector is amazing. The picture is sharp and vibrant. The colors are bright and true. The contrast and detail are excellent. I&rsquo;m sure the only difference is which movie I&rsquo;m watching. True, the remake of Clash of the Titans has terrible 3D. But the conversion of Jurassic Park I just watched was epic. Can&rsquo;t believe it wasn&rsquo;t shot in 3D. It also seems to matter which Blu Ray player I use. My new Sony with the latest network update seems to work better than my old Panasonic that was never updated. The old player had a tendency to freeze on some discs and the new player doesn&rsquo;t do that. It also seems to matter which glasses I wear. I use the DLP link ones. And yes, the more expensive ones seem to work better than some of the very cheap ones I&rsquo;ve tried.The only complaint I have is that the unit is always &ldquo;searching&rdquo; for a signal. Every time my player loads a menu or throws up a title card the projector goes black for a few seconds and &ldquo;searching&rdquo; appears in the lower right corner. This never happens during a movie. Just at the begging of the the disc loading process. I have switched off the auto search function and it has stopped rolling thru all the other input choices but still says searching on HDMI 1 every time I load a new disc. Sometimes it does this five or six times if there are lots of title cards and warnings at the beginning. Annoying, but it doesn&rsquo;t really ruin the movie watching experience.Overall I feel this projector offers great value for the money. You could probably spend thousands of dollars for better, but I&rsquo;m not sure most people would notice the difference. If you&rsquo;ve got a dark room and enough distance to throw a nice large picture, then turn up the surround sound, put in a good movie and get ready to be nicely suprised.</p>
