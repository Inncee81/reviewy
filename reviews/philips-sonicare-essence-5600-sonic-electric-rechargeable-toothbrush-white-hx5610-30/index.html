<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="dentist-recommended">Dentist Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Philips Sonicare HX5610 based on personal recommendation from my dentist (and close friend). I have been undergoing a `rejuvenation&rsquo; of sorts. In the past 6 months I&rsquo;ve made it my goal (with the help of my dentist) to have the healthiest, cleanest and whitest smile possible in preparation for my best friend&rsquo;s wedding. The first step was to upgrade my toothbrush from my old manual toothbrush, to the Sonicare. I chose this because he said it was what he used at home, and it was somewhat economical compared to the other options he mentioned. This is also the reason why I chose this teeth whitening solution as opposed to using his services - he said it would cost me $500 dollars, then laughed and gave me the 2nd option!I am very happy that my dentist is an honest person who will recommend solutions to me not based on personal gain, but on quality. He said the way to use this product is as follows. You&rsquo;ll want to use this product for exactly 2 minutes, 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth. Think about your mouth&rsquo;s surface as having 4 sections, top front, top back (behind), bottom front, and bottom back. There is an easy 2 minute indicator that is built into this brush, which makes it easy to remember when you&rsquo;re done. Or you can simply watch a 2 minuteyoutube video, which is what I do to kill time while brushing! J (pro tip!)I was also worried about gum and teeth sensitivity due to how fast these things go. It&rsquo;s the equivalent to 31,000 brush strokes per minute. I asked my dentists about this, and he said don&rsquo;t worry about it too much, as long as you&rsquo;re not using a tooth-paste with heavy abrasive, because the combination of abrasive action and strokes can do more harm than good if used frequently and often. He recommended to only use a teeth-whitening toothpaste like this one and a teeth whitening system like this one every-so-often to keep your mouth from becoming overly sensitive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE June 2015: I still love this brush, a caveat: Change the brush head much more often than you&rsquo;d think - every 2 months - it works SOOOOO much better with a new brush!!! Also, swish (don&rsquo;t swallow) about a teaspoon of 3% H2O2 (peroxide) with your toothpaste for a ridiculous clean!This toothbrush is amazing! I&rsquo;ll just say this:With a manual brush, I notice a film of plaque reforming after 12 hours or so. I thought this was normal.Well, imagine my surprise when after using the Sonicare, my teeth remained squeaky clean for 3 DAYS! Yes, I experimented to see how long I could go without accumulating plaque. This device cleans the mouth SO thoroughly, it&rsquo;s scary; the junk I spat out after the first use was truly frightening! All that bacteria that had been damaging my smile were dislodged with stunning completeness! The Sonicare literally vibrates the plaque out from under the gum-line!I sincerely wish you try this item for yourself. You will not be disappointed!BTW, in the case of travelling overseas - when fully charged, you&rsquo;ll get about 20 uses on a single charge&hellip;enough for a 10 day trip.A note about the design: I advise simply unscrewing the brush-head after every few uses and cleaning it with peroxide or just plain H2O. This will keep any gunk from accumulating inside the apparatus. It takes about 20 seconds to clean it, so it no big deal, IMO.This model is economically priced and functions flawlessly to give you a clean you thought only a trip to the dentist could give.If you find my review helpful, please give it an up-vote; I really appreciate your feedback!Thanks,Peter</p>

<h5 id="ignore-lies-about-mold">Ignore lies about mold</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My boyfriend has had one of these and I got one for my mother about 6months ago. On their recommendation I decided to get it.2 days into use and everything seems to be going well.Nothing fancy. 2 minute timer is helpful. Indicator light seems to be on at all times despite charging for a day (will keep an eye on that)Seal between brush top and base is not water tight which leads to the rest of my review :Wanted to point out something people seem to be missing with regards to the mold build-upInstructions say :&ldquo;clean the brush at least ONCE PER WEEK, including under the removaleable nut&rdquo;&amp;&ldquo;sonicare handle is dishwasher safe&rdquo;I don&rsquo;t see how mold can be building up as much as in the posted pictures unless they&rsquo;re just not bothering with the maintenence.4 stars for now.Will update later once I&rsquo;ve had the chance to use it more</p>

<h5 id="no-more-cavities">No more cavities!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After my dentist pestered me for months to get an electric toothbrush, I finally caved after I started getting cavities and ended getting 3 root canals. Now, when I get a check up, my dentist is quite happy with the results. I can&rsquo;t thank this product enough! I just wished I got this sooner. Spent $1500 on root canal surgeries, and I&rsquo;m thinking all this could have been prevented if I listened early and paid $60 for an electric toothbrush. Better late than never!</p>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-this-toothbrush">I absolutely love this toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this toothbrush! Admittedly, it took a while to get used to it. I have very sensitive gums, and it took a bit of time to get used to, but keep at it and it will be worth it. My teeth feel so much cleaner. The last time I went to the dentist, they didn&rsquo;t do much of anything because there was nothing to scrape off my teeth. I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever go back to a regular toothbrush. The only issue I have with this toothbrush is that the insides do get gunked up and need to be cleaned. I wish the seal was a little better so that wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-with-one-caveat">Works well with one caveat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just replaced this toothbrush with a series 2. The toothbrush worked well and was still operational. But under the brush there is a cavity that holds the brush assembly.</p>

<p>This toothbrush is amazing! My teeth aren&rsquo;t perfectly straight and this is the only brush that cleans them perfectly and doesn&rsquo;t leave anything gross behind.</p>

<h5 id="love-my-sonicare">Love My Sonicare!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sonicare for decades and prefer the old style model like this one. My dentist hates me, because my teeth and gums are really healthy. LOL!</p>
