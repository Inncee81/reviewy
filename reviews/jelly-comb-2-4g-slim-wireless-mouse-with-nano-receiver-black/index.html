<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="blew-away-expectations">Blew Away Expectations!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really write that many reviews on Amazon. I just don&rsquo;t have the time, which is unfair bc I base every purchase on the reviews people have created the time to assist others with their purchases. I was at a meeting last week and noticed all my coworkers have stopped using traditional corded mice and started using the wireless ones. I found this mouse had great reviews and nice color options. It came in yesterday and BLEW AWAY MY EXPECTATIONS. The click feels so good, I know that sounds weird but not too hard or not too soft. Everything is ergonomic. I am so happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="silent-but-deadly">Silent, but deadly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price this mouse is quite good. The top is soft touch material, and the buttons have very quiet click sounds. I also like that the mouse goes to sleep when not in use, and you need to click to wake it. That way accidental table bumps or cats jumping on your desk won&rsquo;t wake your PC.About the only thing I was disappointed in was the wheel. Being a ball, I thought it freely rotated in all directions for side scrolling. It&rsquo;s actually just a wheel for vertical scrolling, though it works just fine. I won&rsquo;t take a star away because it&rsquo;s such a bargain, but be aware it&rsquo;s not actually a ball!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-especially-for-the-price">great buy, especially for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>have had no problems with this. Was worried about it working on a hard desk surface without a mouse pad, but tracks perfectly! very light, but comfortable in the hand. Also, it is almost dead silent with clicking, moving, and rolling of the ball which is good while in a quiet lecture class. I use it with my Surface Pro 3, and it&rsquo;s fantastic. I like how the USB fits right into the mouse itself. At first I thought they messed up and forgot to package the USB connector, but it is right next to where the battery goes!Do feel I should note that the ball scroller is not really a ball. It looks like it should go every-which-way but it does not. It only goes on track forwards and backwards. This is fine, but the look of it makes you think you can scroll in any direction and you cannot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sleek-and-easy-to-use">Sleek and Easy To Use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am actually quite pleased with this mouse. I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to be that great considering it&rsquo;s so affordable but I was wrong. There&rsquo;s many colors to choose from which I think is a really neat idea. I choose purple because it&rsquo;s my favorite color. I have provided colors of what it looks like, however I think my flash turned it looking pink haha. It&rsquo;s actually purple and not pink for the record.The mouse was actually really easy to set up and literally took seconds before I was ready to go. The mini receiver fits right into my USB port and connects right away. You will need 1 AA battery which isn&rsquo;t included so keep that in mind when purchasing. I have a laptop so of course I have the mouse pad thingy (haha whatever you call it) and I can&rsquo;t stand it. The mouse is so much faster and easier to use. It&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t lag which is nice and has a really slick design. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with it so far and the quality is actually quite impressive. I would definitely purchase one of these again for my husbands laptop and these would also make great gifts. Very pleased!</p>

<h5 id="ergonomic-use-matters-in-a-mouse">Ergonomic use matters in a mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Jelly comb wireless mouse is a perfect combination of ergonomics and performance. It suits my needs perfectly. Although the design is generic, it is comfortable and portable. It comes in numerous designs and precision is good. So lets jot down its strengths.1. Mouse response is nice with less noice.2. Slim design and a unique comfort surface. Its very fast to click and is pretty responsive.3. Simple to setup with the given USB receiver. I used it with a windows pc.4. Good range, in case you would like to use it with your pc. 15 meters is decent.5. The USB receiver can easily hide inside the mouse.6. A decent battery life. I don&rsquo;t remember when I changed it.7. High DPI for great gaming sessions.8. Scroll wheel is pretty useful.Amazon quickly displays this product on search because of the popularity and usability to users. Go for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-very-well-absolutely-worth-the-try">Works very well, absolutely worth the try!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse really positively surprised me. I am usually prepared for disappointment since it is pretty much a shot in the dark to buy cheap electronics. I bought the keyboard from the same seller as this mouse, and it didn&rsquo;t function correctly and looked and felt cheap. However this mouse certainly was a pleasant surprise. Of course it&rsquo;s still not comparable to the mouse Apple sells, but it works well, it feels great and it&rsquo;s absolutely worth the price. I actually love that it doesn&rsquo;t make a clicking sound when you use it. It feels soft and makes no sound when you &ldquo;click&rdquo; on something, which I love. I&rsquo;ve used it for about a week now and it works completely fine. I connected it to my Chromebook Pro that I just got. Certainly recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-mouse-worked-great-for-two-months-but-now-won-t-work">The mouse worked great for two months but now won&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mouse worked great for two months but now won&rsquo;t work. And yes, I did replace the battery. Can&rsquo;t return it as it has been more than a month, so now I have a paperweight. 😕</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="inexpensive-quiet-smooth-tracking">Inexpensive, Quiet, Smooth Tracking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am quite hard on my mice and purchased this to replace another wireless mouse that bit the dust.This works great. It&rsquo;s very, very quiet. It&rsquo;s so quiet it could definitely in a silent library without disturbing anyone. Tracking is smooth. It is accurate and fast and works well on a regular desktop with no mousepad. It stays connected all the time and if it does go to sleep a quick click with one button and it is immediately awake and ready to go. The white and silver color looks great with my Mac and there was zero setup beyond plugging it in and turning it on. The only annoying thing is that it does take up a precious USB port, but it&rsquo;s worth it for ease of use. You also can&rsquo;t beat the price!</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great wireless mouse. It works great on any surface and is definitely useful for my schoolwork in college</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really cute and works well</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-needs-directions-in-the-box">Great value - needs directions in the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works fine. Great value. However, I would suggest that they include directions to locate the transmitter in the box.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-apple">better than Apple</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought two, better then the apple magic mouse they replaced and way easier to link.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-pleased-about-it">I am pleased about it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse is ideally suited to the design of my laptop. I am pleased about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-stylish">Good &amp; stylish!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mouse works well, stylish, the white matches my Mac white keyboard nicely.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple">Simple</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great mouse. Especially for left handers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-an-excellent-mouse-for-the-price">this is an excellent mouse for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, this is an excellent mouse for the price. The customer service is amazing to, as they emailed me after I received the product to check in on how I liked it and if I&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-quiet-click">Super quiet click!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I seriously had no idea a mouse could have a click this soft and quiet. It is very nice to the touch also, so it is a great mouse for a desk jockey like myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is quick and super affordable.</p>
