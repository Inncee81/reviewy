<h5 id="works-great-for-1-3-weeks-then-foam-detaches-from-plastic-core-and-it-becomes-unusable">Works great for 1-3 weeks, then foam detaches from plastic core and it becomes unusable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They fit great on the Shure SE215 and provide a great seal initially with the ear, I find them a little easier to get in place than the stock tips and they are very comfortable. Unfortunately the quality of the foam and adhesive used to keep the foam attached to the rubber cylinder are poor quality and the foam rips away after 1-2 weeks of daily use (see attached picture). This causes the rough plastic core under the foam to contact your ear instead of the foam, also causing a very poor seal so bad sound and sound isolation.1/3/17: Updating my prior review, I&rsquo;ve tried the suggestion of carefully compressing the foam before inserting them into my ears, as is recommended. I&rsquo;ve done this on 2 sets of the foam plugs, however the increased time before the foam tears from the core is not that significant, you might get 2-3 weeks at best of quality daily use.1/6/17: Updated picture to show new vs 1 month of usage. I talked with Comply customer service and they confirmed they expect their tips to last about 2-3 months. They are sending me a replacement set as mine were less than half of that, maybe mine were &ldquo;defective&rdquo;. Also you can see in the picture that the red color foam really doesn&rsquo;t hold up well, I would recommend just getting black.</p>

<h5 id="your-ears-will-thank-you">Your ears will thank you.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Comply foam tips for years now, and they&rsquo;re the best option out there outside of universal custom molds.In the past, I&rsquo;ve always used their P-series (longer length, better seal and isolation) but they&rsquo;re not an option for the earphones I&rsquo;m currently using. So I picked up the T-200 model (sans wax filter) and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. The seal is excellent for their size, if a bit less thorough than I was used to with the P-series.After a couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve noticed very few issues. They maintain their springiness well after multiple uses, haven&rsquo;t given me any problems with unexpected early ripping or tearing like you&rsquo;ll eventually see with foam tips, and have lasted well so far. Figure maybe 1 to 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months of moderate use per pair if you pay attention and treat them well. After so many uses, <em>any</em> pair of foam tips (regardless of manufacturer) will start to fall apart due to repeated wear. In the past, the grey P-series always got dirty pretty quickly. Some water and a damp cloth will help you clean them, but repeated cleanings will help hasten their demise by a bit. The colored options, obviously, won&rsquo;t appear as dirty as quickly.Well worth the price.</p>

<h5 id="well-worth-the-money">Well worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a set of Klipsch S4I earbud that I have had for years. I love the oval tips and thought that the sound from them was great but they have to be positioned just right for the best isolation and sound quality. My left ear seems to be a bit odd and I have to push the tip in and then retract it part of the way to get the earbud tip to flare enough to seal properly. I figured it was time to start looking for some replacement tips and thought I would give the Comply tips a try since they had so many great reviews.Mine arrived today (size medium). As great as I thought the OEM Klipsch tips were, these are a cut above. The OEMs had a great sound and isolation but these Comply tips are almost like being in a soundproof booth. The base is even tighter and more pronounced without overpowering the rest of the spectrum. After compressing them and inserting them in my ears it only took about 3-4 seconds for them to expand and start sealing off the outside sounds.As far as comfort goes, I think the OEM Klipsch tip has the Comply beat. The Comply tips are comfortable but once the Klipsch tips are in you almost don&rsquo;t know they are there and I have worn them for hours with no problem, however, they do have to be readjusted periodically while exercising or moving around a lot. I haven&rsquo;t exercised while using the Comply tips but once they are seated properly gentle tugging on the cord doesn&rsquo;t seem to displace them at all. But I can certainly tell the Comply tips are in my ear and it may just be something I have to adjust to and that is the only reason I gave them a 4 star rating instead of the full 5. I would certainly buy them again.UPDATE 01/24/2017 - One of my earbuds became clogged and I just noticed that contrary to the information for the Comply website, these foam tips DO NOT have the built in ear wax screen. I had no problem with the OEM tips allowing wax or debris into the sound channel of the in-earbuds but after a few weeks of using the Comply tips the left earbud is mostly clogged.</p>

<h5 id="not-the-solution-sorry-but-better-than-nothing">NOT THE SOLUTION SORRY BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I use a similar item shooting I never have a problem with the buds coming out of my ears. But put me in a gym and I cannot get a pair to stay in!!!These I thought were the answer to my Beats that slowly worked their way out of my ears over several months. So I got these since in theory these should stay in (based on my shooting experience).Well they don&rsquo;t stay in after a few days of ear wax buildup. They need to be thicker so the fit is tighter as they swell back up and form a seal. But they are rather thin and flimsy and easily distort when you try to affix them to the earphone for the first time.I&rsquo;m beginning to think that occlusive headbuds and headphones (over ear) are the only solution to avoiding lousy gym music.I honestly do not understand why one cannot buy an OCCLUSIVE ear bud that stays in your effin ear. And why not make headphones that are smaller so you don&rsquo;t look like the biggest knob in the gym with those ridiculous large phones for ears?</p>

<h5 id="comfortable-but-not-durable">Comfortable but not durable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very comfortable, not very durable. Wouldn&rsquo;t get these for your commuter head phones. Each set lasted maybe a month. Though for the price, this isn&rsquo;t a bad deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-work-also-dissolve-though">They work. Also dissolve though.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good earbud adapters. They stay right in my ear even when running around. One problem I have found it that they start to dissolve/fall apart after awhile from sweat.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t isolate sound as well as the foam tips on my Shure SE215 earbuds &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not the worst part.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>More comfortable, better sounding, better looking, better chance of not losing, than the stock silicone buds</p>

<h5 id="i-really-only-wanted-one-size-i-would-have">I really only wanted one size. I would have &hellip;</h5>

<p>I really only wanted one size. I would have preferred another color. They work really well, but the color has faded making them look gross.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-for-mee-audio-m6-pro">Fantastic for MEE audio M6 PRO</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work great for my MEE audio M6 PRO. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the difference b/w the normal pads and tehse but I can say they went on , stayed on and are comfy in my ears.</p>

<p>The foam is of a significantly cheaper quality than what came with my Dunu DN-1000 earphones. I can even tell now by looking at the pictures online &ndash; there are more air bubbles&hellip;</p>
