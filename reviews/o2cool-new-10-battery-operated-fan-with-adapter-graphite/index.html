<h5 id="power-cord-is-too-short-but-love-the-fan-other-than-that">Power cord is too short, but love the fan other than that</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome fan, with one exception: the wall-plug-in cord is way too short (5 ft). I don&rsquo;t always want to run it on the D batteries (they&rsquo;re expensive and bad for the environment), but to put the fan in the doorway or window, you have to have a plug close by or use an extension cord. There is not a longer AC adapter available at this time.I brought it to the beach condo since the room runs hot. It worked great to place it in the doorway and bring in cool air. It has 2 speed settings (high and low) and runs pretty quite even on high. It&rsquo;s small and durable enough that I can throw it in the car for travel or even camping. The footing folds up and also makes the vertical angle of the fan adjustable. It is completely plastic and no metal parts.You can run it with the D batteries (8 of them) which makes the unit bottom heavy and nice and sturdy. You can run it without the batteries and just use the plug in and it&rsquo;s pretty light weight. You will gets days of fan use on one set of batteries&hellip;so a great way to go in power outages, camping, etc.There is also a car adapter available, but it&rsquo;s not included in the box and not currently available on Amazon or on O2Cool&rsquo;s web site, but you can order directly from the company by calling 800-200-2665. The car adapter is only $9.99 and free shipping. It has a 6 foot cord. (Note: you can also purchase a replacement wall adapter (AC) for $14.99, again with free shipping.It has built in handle that you don&rsquo;t really notice, but handy for picking it up and adjusting. There are no &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; included, but not really necessary since you can pretty much figure out how to open the battery compartment, adjust the angle, and use the high/low/off switch.Cleaning. You can wipe down the outside, but there&rsquo;s no easy way to clean the fan blades. There are some screws on the back, but I haven&rsquo;t attempted to take it apart to clean as of yet.FYI: Product is Made in China, but their customer service and warehouse is located in Illinois. I called customer service to inquire about the car adapter and the young lady who answered was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable.</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This the perfect portable fan (though it also comes with an ac adapter)I am amazed at how much power comes from using the eight D batteries. The best feature is that the batteries are in the flat base of the fan, which really weights it down and allows it to be really sturdy and steady. The instructions say to use a screw-driver or a coin to open the battery holder. I found that a quarter works best. The bottom line is that if you need a portable fan, this is the one to buy. In fact, I&rsquo;m going to order another one asap.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-bought-this-after-a-friend-recommended-it-to-me">I bought this after a friend recommended it to me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this after a friend recommended it to me. Probably good for a desk or small space, but this fan is not powerful enough for my purposes. I&rsquo;ll put it in the window in my house and it doesn&rsquo;t cool down the space- I have a small living room and bedroom, which is primarily where I&rsquo;ll use it. It has to be blowing directly in my path or on me for me to feel cool, even on the higher setting. It also slows down from time to time with no warning- only last for a few seconds, but it sounds like it&rsquo;s about to die before picking back up. I like that it is battery-operated but also comes with adapter. A fan this small uses 8 D batteries though? Kind of a pain. I mostly keep it plugged it so I don&rsquo;t use up the batteries- which can be expensive. It&rsquo;s OK but I doubt I would buy this again.</p>

<h5 id="great-fan-for-a-power-outage">Great fan for a power outage!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in an area prone to power outages. When that happens wedon&rsquo;t run the generator at night. We use these fans (D-Cell powered)to blow at night while we are sleeping. (tropical island). I&rsquo;ve personallyrun these fans over 2 days straight on the same set of batteries. Themodel with the adjustable base is wonderful!You could make a setup with a solar panel to charge renewablebatteries if you wanted. It also has a A/C plug when you have power.Great fans and long lasting!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-worked-fine-the-5-or-so-times-i-used-it">It worked fine the 5 or so times I used it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I keep this fan on our boat which is dry stacked at Eglin AFB. It worked fine the 5 or so times I used it. Now, it does not work on high speed and low speed has power fluctuation problems. I purchased this on April 30, 2015 and it is now September 20th. It hasn&rsquo;t even been 6 months yet.What a crappy product. I have not attempted warranty work yet so perhaps that may yield positive results. I would not recommend this product as you will not get much life out of it. CAVEAT EMPTOR - Buyer Beware</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-great-i-cannot-speak-to-battery-longevity-as-i">It works great. I cannot speak to battery longevity as I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ran this fan constantly for the last four days while camping in extremely hot weather and was very grateful to have it. It works great. I cannot speak to battery longevity as I had it plugged into an inverter and running off of a large 12 volt battery, however, it uses much less power than the roof fan in my van. And I can move this one around wherever I need it. I like the fact that it runs off of batteries and A/C. I like the fact that the base ratchets back and forth for tilting and storage. It has alot of power for the size of the fan. I think the fan is pretty quiet, however, I like a little &ldquo;white noise&rdquo; when trying to sleep. I have two of these. My dog likes hers too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-fan-was-a-godsend-and-saved-us-in-italy">This fan was a Godsend and SAVED us in Italy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We got this fan for our recent trip to Italy. It is very lightweight and fit easily in my suitcase. I bought the batteries in the U.S. and carried them over with me. They were weighty, but I left the used batteries there to lighten up my bag for the return trip. I could have just bought them there, as well.This fan worked beautifully and saved us in hotel rooms where the a/c was iffy. It absolutely saved us in Sicily where the a/c was practically non-existent. We used the plug most of the time, but there were a couple of times when we used the battery power because plugs were scarce or we were out on a balcony. We were very, very happy we had it. In that heat, without it we wouldn&rsquo;t have slept and would have become very cranky!Friends, who travel a lot more than we are able, have remarked at what a great idea it was and will be traveling with this type of fan from now on.Going forward, I&rsquo;m very happy to have the battery option available for when the power goes out during the summer thunderstorms (as it always does!). The heat and humidity in those situations can be beastly.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-for-camping">Excellent for Camping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our family camped in a no electricity cabin and used this fan as white noise. This fan worked exactly as expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-fan">Nice little fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent air output for what it is, a small cheap plastic low powered fan</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-great-for-camping">This is great for camping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great for camping. I used this over a weekend while camping in a tent and it was perfect!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-camper-my-car-in-fl-has-no-ac-none-of-the-windows-go-down-o2-cool-does-a-fair-job">Great for camper.My car in FL has no ac, none of the windows go down.O2 cool does a fair job.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Strong. Also runs on ac. 2 speeds AND an off position RoadPro rpsc-857 slightly better, but only useful in a car. Both good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fine-not-very-strong">Fine, not very strong.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fan is fine, easy to setup,adjust tilt, pretty solid. Wind/air speed even on highest setting is very weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for travel!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-design-and-nice-breeze-with-2-speeds">Great design and nice breeze with 2 speeds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was looking for a fan with no cords. This is perfect. Nice breeze with no cords. Just what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-isn-t-super-strong-but-moves-the-air-around-enough-to-cool">It isn&rsquo;t super strong but moves the air around enough to cool &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this a few years ago for taking to art fairs and I&rsquo;ve never had to change out the batteries! I plugged it in when I could but having a battery back up is a lifesaver.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stay-cool">Stay cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t expect to be impressed for a little plastic fan but was I ever wrong! This thing is crazy powerful; for the size and it&rsquo;s fairly quiet. Love that you can plug it as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="life-saver">Life Saver!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan saved me. I worked as a card merchandizer for American Greetings, so I worked in the different stores putting cards up and keeping the racks straight.</p>
