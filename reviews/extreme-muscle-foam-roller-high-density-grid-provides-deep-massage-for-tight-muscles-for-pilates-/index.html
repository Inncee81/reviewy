<h5 id="it-still-has-that-really-great-high-density-foam-that-the-other-2-models">It still has that really great, high density foam that the other 2 models &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Epitomie Fitness has really outdone themselves with their latest release: the Extreme Muscle Foam Roller. It still has that really great, high density foam that the other 2 models are made of (which is perfect because no one likes a limp foam roller!) And it&rsquo;s even more compact than the previous models, making it much easier to take around while traveling. What really sets this apart from their previous models are the much more pronounced spikes, which aren&rsquo;t as painful to roll across as they appear to be. Personally, my upper and lower back muscles are incredibly stiff, tight, and very knotted up, so hard/deep massages are usually my preference. The extreme foam roller really mimicked the feeling of getting a deep tissue massage right in my own home. The pointed spikes feel more like a masseuse&rsquo;s strong fingers, and it was great for applying pressure into those super tight areas on my back to relax and ease all of the tension that I had been carrying around, and left me feeling much more relieved after a quick 10 minute session. For areas that were super sore or tender, I still found the extreme foam roller very useful for working and relieving the pain. Instead of applying the full weight of the problematic area, I would instead apply a very light pressure or I would gently move the roller up and down against the muscle and found that this worked well. I would highly recommend this product!</p>

<h5 id="not-for-newbies">Not For Newbies!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>NOT FOR NEWBIES!!! If you are new to foam rolling, get the cheap plain black foam roller that won&rsquo;t last you long because you will wear it out. Also, start there because it won&rsquo;t hurt too much. When you get to be a foam rolling pro, you won&rsquo;t want foam, you&rsquo;ll want a PVC pipe because it never wears out. I use a PVC pipe now since I&rsquo;ve been foam rolling after workouts for a while. But PVC doesn&rsquo;t have all the nooks and crannies to get deeper into your muscles in specific places.The Extreme Muscle foam roller from Epitomie does just that: its made to get deep into muscle tissue. Its certainly not as hard as PVC pipe, but this is a very tough foam roller (dare I say, extreme). Its not for newbies. It hurts. Oh it hurts so good. Its great to roll up and down on your back, stopping on those extra tense places for a minute and letting the spikes get in there. Your own body weight on this thing is much more intense than on a plain foam roller. Once you&rsquo;ve worn out a beginner foam roller, get this one. If you&rsquo;ve already moved up to PVC pipe, get this one too. It&rsquo;ll find tense spots the flat surface of the PVC pipe rolled right over. Highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="and-both-of-them-are-my-favorite-out-of-the-5-i-currently-own">and both of them are my favorite out of the 5 I currently own</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As always Epitomie Fitness is at the top of its game.I now currently own 2 foam rollers by them, and both of them are my favorite out of the 5 I currently own. I have a weakness for foam rollers, can never have too many!This style of foam roller is not for the novice and it is a trigger point roller. What this means, is the little spikes that come out of this roller essentially deep tissue massage your muscles and it is painful if you have never used one before. This type of roller really digs deep, and gets out the kinks, its quite wonderful. I highly recommend using this foam roller, its also small so its very portable.Epiotmie fitness is simply the best.</p>

<h5 id="epitomie-fitness-extreme-muscle-foam-roller-rocks">Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam Roller Rocks!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently got an Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam Roller and have been using it every day since I received it. This is my fitness review of the Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam Roller.Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam Roller Kryptonite GreenDespite working out for many years, I’ve never really been into foam rollers. That is probably to my detriment and due to not taking the time to try them or use them in the right way. I have used some in the past, but never consistently and probably never in the right way. Lucky for me, Epitomie Fitness provided some great videos on how to use the foam roller like a pro!I ordered the Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam Roller from Amazon and it arrived the very same day! Not sure if every area in the US gets this kind of service – but I am in San Diego and was super impressed! When I purchased this foam roller, it was on sale, marked down from $39.99 to $26.97 – a discount of 33%. Same day shipping was free since I am an Amazon Prime member.The first thing that I noticed about the Epitomie Extreme Muscle Foam Roller was that it was firmer and better designed than any other foam roller I have ever seen or used. Most foam rollers are made of fairly squishy foam – sort of like a swimming pool noodle. Not so with the foam roller from Epitomie Fitness. It is very well constructed (and comes with a lifetime guarantee so you will never wear it out). This foam roller is available in Blood Orange, Fire Red or Kryptonite Green. I chose the Kryptonite Green and I love the color.Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam RollerThe Extreme Muscle Foam Roller from Epitomie Fitness is designed with both finger and palm pressure points which allow you to really work and massage your muscles, giving your body a super great deep tissue massage. When I purchased this foam roller, I was experiencing some real tightness in my right hip so that is the area that I started working right away. I do highly recommend following the instructions that come with the product so you can get access to the free videos online and learn the right way to use it. Using the Extreme Muscle Foam Roller has helped loosen my tight hip muscles and I’ve enjoyed using it for a lot of other muscle groups as well.Whether you are super active and workout all the time or if you just suffer from sore and tight muscles, I highly recommend purchasing and using the Epitomie Fitness Extreme Muscle Foam Roller. It will definitely be the last foam roller you will ever need to buy!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-muscle-foam-roller-to-relieve-tense-muscle">Excellent muscle foam roller to relieve tense muscle.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is great when muscle is really tense. I previously had an Achilles tendon rupture and had to do surgery to put it back together. The extreme muscle foam roller really helped me in my recovery time and after 5 months of purchasing this roller, I am feeling much better. It does hurt a little but once you continue to do it, it does help relieve the stiffness in the muscle. I really love Epitomie Fitness as I been using a lot of their products and really love the orange color as it is easy on the eyes.</p>
