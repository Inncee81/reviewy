<h5 id="pretty-easy-to-put-on-her-feet-and-will-keep">Pretty easy to put on her feet and will keep &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so cute!! Got the small size for my 12 month old daughter and they fit with some room to spare. The bottoms have little grippy things on them, but I may add small dots of superglue to give her more traction. Pretty easy to put on her feet and will keep out the sand at our upcoming beach trip.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-water-shoes">Love these water shoes!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Medium size for my 21 month old son and they fit perfectly. For reference, he wears a 6.5 W in Stride Rite. These shoes were perfect for our week long vacation at the beach. They were easy to put on and stayed on. My son usually pulls off socks, but these stayed on all day. He wore them in and out of the water. They protected his feet from the hot sand. They are also great for the splash pad park, as they have some grippy traction on the bottom. Even my skeptical husband (who thinks a lot of the toddler products I purchase are silly and unnecessary) thought these were great. Great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-barefooted">Better Than Barefooted!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great for 2 year old granddaughter when she visits. She wears them inside and outside and can go right into our pool while still wearing them. She puts them on herself and they seem to be comfortable. They dry quickly. Our baby is taller than most her age and the largest size they sell fits for now but I wish they made them in a few larger sizes for when we need them. In fact, since I&rsquo;m usually following grand around, I &rsquo;d like a pair in my size too! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-my-12-month-old-daughter-thinks-they-are-super-fun-to-wear">&hellip; and my 12 month old daughter thinks they are super fun to wear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very cute and my 12 month old daughter thinks they are super fun to wear. Helps keep babies feet from getting burnt on hot pavement or sand. They aren&rsquo;t made the best however since after only a few uses the stitching is coming apart on the toe and side of the shoes. Definitely not meant for more than one season or child&rsquo;s use, but decent for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="protects-from-slippery-and-hot-surfaces">Protects from slippery and hot surfaces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 18 month old loves wearing her water sock shoes. And I love the grips on the bottom. They keep her safe at our splash pads and slippery public pools. They protect her feet from getting burned on super hot pavements in Texas. And they worked great on the hot sand in Florida. We bought the 6-12 month size, however she is very small for her age and wears 6-12 month clothes as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shoes-for-more-than-just-water">Shoes for more than just water</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for a new walker. Sneakers are sometimes uncomfortable for my baby (she is a size 3.5 at 11 months) but these water shoes are great not only on the beach or at the pool but also on the grass/playground etc. I have 2 pairs so as they get dirty I can wash one (they wash up nicely!). They are a bit slippery on certain floors so beware but I love using them for long walks outside when I know her sneakers may bother her after a while. They are a bit big on her but she still manages to walk well in them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-slippery-surfaces">Perfect for slippery surfaces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are perfect for the pool or beach and can be kept on both while swimming and walking/running. My toddler walks well with them because they fit like socks but with grip on the bottom. She wants to wear these around the house just for fun.My kid is 16 months, a size 4.5 in most toddler shoes, and the small size for these fits her but just barely. I ordered the next size up and they&rsquo;re maybe <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch too long for her. I will keep ordering these swim shoes for her as she gets older.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-don-t-have-slick-surfaces-for-testing-but-she-ran-in-them-along-our-linoleum-floors-and-they-had-good-traction-i-like-that">We don&rsquo;t have slick surfaces for &ldquo;testing&rdquo; but she ran in them along our linoleum floors and they had good traction. I like that</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these in anticipation of starting swim class with my 1 year old. I bought the Mediums. She wears size 3 Garanimals shoes right now. I couldn&rsquo;t wrangle her for a measure in cm. She&rsquo;ll have plenty of room to grow so they should last until the end of summer. They MIGHT fit next year as these shoes were as long as some small 5&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;re thin and appear to be well-sewn. It wasn&rsquo;t a struggle to slip them onto my daughter&rsquo;s feet. We don&rsquo;t have slick surfaces for &ldquo;testing&rdquo; but she ran in them along our linoleum floors and they had good traction. I like that they&rsquo;re more firm than a swim &lsquo;sock&rsquo;. I wish they were a bit cheaper (since you can tell they&rsquo;re inexpensive to make), but you can&rsquo;t put a price on pool safety.</p>

<p>These work great and my daughter loves them, have held up well even with her dragging her toes on cement. I believe we had to size down for her. She is 2.5.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These have been great for my son all summer (we live at the beach). They fit snug at the ankle so they don&rsquo;t fall off, but plenty wide in the in-step for chubby baby feet.</p>
