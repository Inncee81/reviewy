<h5 id="not-bad-but-had-initial-issue">Not bad, but had initial issue&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice product at the sale price. I wouldn&rsquo;t have bought at anywhere near retail however. One issue I had out of the box deserves comment. If you have a prior Google account, when you sign in it will sync with your prior bookmarks and extensions. I had an immediate issue with chrome crashing every 30 seconds! What worked for me was to &ldquo;browse as a Guest&rdquo; from the login screen then select the &ldquo;customize and control Google&rdquo; under the &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the browser (those three vertical dots thing) then selecting &ldquo;settings&rdquo;. Next, select the blue &ldquo;about Chrome OS&rdquo; in the top center of the screen. Now hit the &ldquo;check for and apply updates&rdquo; box. After a few minutes, it will load and you will be prompted to restart the unit. I guess my problem was that my Lenovo shipped with an earlier version of Chrome that wasn&rsquo;t compatible with my synced extensions and was causing a loop of chrome crashing. I am glad I stumbled upon this before I decided to ship it back!</p>

<h5 id="light-bright-quick">Light Bright, Quick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a newbie when it comes to Chromebooks, but have been using computers for over 30 years.I wanted a light unit with a touchscreen and narrowed it down to this Lenovo N22-20, the Acer R11, and the HP 11 G5 touchscreen model. Their specs are essentially identical including CPU, size and weight. The R11 fold back 360 degrees to be a tablet, but the mic kept be from buying it.So, I went with the Lenovo because it went on sale for $179.99 just before Christmas, a great price for the features. And it has worked very well for me. Setup is a cinch with a Chromebook (CB) and it&rsquo;s bright IPS display, very good touchpad and touchscreen are a delight to use. I&rsquo;ve had over a dozen tabs open with no slowing down.But, I&rsquo;ve also had only 4 tabs open and it got sluggish because of all the ads that were being pushed on the pages I had opened. Ads upon ads upon ads. After the ads stop, the pages would refresh to show even more ads. NOTE: This is not a problem with the CB, this is an issue with so many sites now pushing more &amp; more ads on us&ndash;enough that I have stopped going to certain sites anymore.Sorry for the rant, but ads are getting just too darn annoying nowadays. Back to the CB. Being a Lenovo, it has a very nice keyboard with decent travel and is also pretty quiet. A nice extra on this Lenovo is the carrying handle.A downside of it is the &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; full-size SD card slot; cards only go about halfway in. If I bump the SD card, I sometimes get a pop-up message (Whoa there. Be careful.) warning me that I should eject the card before removing it. This is why 4 instead of 5 stars.I am going to try an adapter card that &lsquo;should&rsquo; make my MicroSD card flush (I am using a MicroSD card with a standard size SD card adapter):<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015130F78/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2EPGHYCUTGVR6I">https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015130F78/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2EPGHYCUTGVR6I</a> also use the microphone a lot and this one picks up well (I did not get the Acer R11 because of too many mic complaints). On the N22, the mic and camera are mounted on a swivel so as to point at the user or away&ndash;just be sure to rotate it the correct directions, it&rsquo;s in the documentation that comes with it. Even with it pointing away, the mic still picks up very well.Update 1-18-17: I&rsquo;ve been enjoying my N22-20 and I (finally) received the above-mentioned SD Card adapter and it fits perfectly. I stuck my 64 GB Micro SD Card in it and it slides in flush with the side of the computer. No more accidentally bumping it and getting that &ldquo;Oops, you should eject your device before removing it&rdquo; message.I also purchased the Transcend Lite 330 short SD Card (64 GB, there&rsquo;s also 128 &amp; 256 GB) and it only sticks out about 1 mm:<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Transcend-JetDrive-Storage-Expansion-TS64GJDL330/dp/B00K73NSXQ/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484806981&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr&amp;keywords=transcend+Jetdrive+lite+330">https://smile.amazon.com/Transcend-JetDrive-Storage-Expansion-TS64GJDL330/dp/B00K73NSXQ/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484806981&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr&amp;keywords=transcend+Jetdrive+lite+330</a></p>

<h5 id="all-is-perfect-and-i-still-use-it">all is perfect, and I still use it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this unit for travel, and it did perfectly. Connectivity to wi-fi, ease of use, plenty of battery life, light weight, all is perfect, and I still use it, sometimes in place of using my excellent Asus. I recommend it for anyone wanting it for emailing, composing notes, viewing clips, these kinds of &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; uses. I&rsquo;m not a gamer, so I have no opinion on that kind of use with this notebook.</p>

<p>Lenovo Chromebook N22 11.6&rdquo; Notebook, IPS Touchscreen, Intel N3060 Dual-Core, 16GB eMMC SSD, 4GB DDR3, 802.11ac, Bluetooth, ChromeOS This Chromebook is awesome. It has 4G of memory and a touch screen that works great. It feels zippy and the build in webcam can be rotated backwards for privacy. The screen is IPS and is sharp and clear. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, card reader, and 802.11ac wifi. I bought two of these and while the product description says up to 10hrs of battery life, I left it unplugged for two days and both days I watched tons of netflix movies and the battery status still showed over <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> full, so 10 hours seems rather low to me. With the amounts of heavy use that I put these through, It never got warm to the touch and there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any need for a fan.If you are looking for a good rugged Chromebook, this is it!! I really can&rsquo;t find any downsides to this product. While it doesn&rsquo;t yet support android apps, It is on the list of supported Chromebooks to become compatible in the near future to include the android play store.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-kids-or-adults-google-apps-coming-soon">Perfect for kids or adults!!! Google Apps Coming Soon :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these for my kids since they kept breaking my expensive laptops &hellip; Yes, multiple laptops and tablets, times! Anyhow, we paid 179.00 for each through woot and got same day shipping for free. These things just showed up and they are awesome! I have lots of computers including a premium flagship Chromebook Pixel and can say without a doubt that these Lenovo&rsquo;s are great. Not as good as Pixel obviously but good for what they&rsquo;re designed for. They are also on the list for the Google Play App Store inclusion so &ldquo;sometime in early 2017 this device will be eligible&rdquo;. Then after switching to developer mode you will be able to download all the same apps that your Android phone has access to. Touchscreen will be nice for the apps too! I think I may also order one for myself to use while traveling 😁</p>
