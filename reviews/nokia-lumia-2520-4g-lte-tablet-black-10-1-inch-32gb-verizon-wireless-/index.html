<h5 id="without-a-doubt-the-best-tablet-device-i-have-ever-owned-and-i-have-owned-a-lot-of-them">Without a doubt the best tablet device I have ever owned..and I have owned a lot of them.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will preface this review by saying that I own iPads, iPad minis, a Surface, and have used Galaxy tabs. The Nokia 2520 is without a doubt the best tablet I own.The 2520 is lightning fast. Apps boot and run without any hesitation. The Windows interface makes iOS look antiquated. When I jump over to the iPad for something, I always think at how the Nokia makes the iPad interface look like an old toy.The picture on the Lumia is extremely good yet soft. When I first bought it I set the iPad with Retina next to it. Their detail is similar but the Lumia is easier to look at for some reason. The glass has better eye feel, if that makes sense. I have tried using the iPad for reading on vacation and two things happened; it had terrible glare, and after 30 minutes in the sun it would overheat. The Lumia is so much better for reading than the iPad it is not comparable. The non-glare screen is very usable in the sun. The unit itself did not overheat on me in the sun but to be honest, I did not really test it for long durations.The Lumia is very light, much lighter than a Surface. The battery power is impressive. I would say you can get 12 hours of actual use (depending on what you are doing) and several days in standby mode without a charge. The width of the unit is similar to an iPad possibly 10% thicker. When you hold it in your hand the difference is not really noticeable. It is much thinner and lighter than the MS Surface, but because of it&rsquo;s beveled edges and firm feeling case, I think it feels more sturdy than a Surface.The sensitivity of the screen is incredible. The on screen keyboard is very versatile however more feature rich (and complex) than the iPad. It takes a couple days to get used to it but once you do it is very productive. The handwriting recognition that is an option built into the keyboard interface is amazing. My handwriting is terrible and it makes very few mistakes interpreting what I am trying to say.The 2520 is expandable to a point. I inserted a 64 GB Micro Smart Card to store music and movies. I was a little disappointed that it did not support bigger cards but as the tech world moves to the cloud, I guess on-device storage is becoming less and less important. Regardless, I would like to have the ability to plug in a 128GB if I chose but 64 is the max. It also has a USB 3 port and I have never used it.The sound on the 2520 is excellent. The sound with and without headphones is vastly superior to any of my other devices. The positioning of the speakers is smart and watching movies without headphones is quite easy. It has more sound power as well. I tested headphone volume with this device versus the iPad and Surface using the same ear bugs and this is far better than both.The camera is decent. It takes good pictures and is extremely good for video even in lower light (I use it for Skype). But the camera is not something I use often&hellip;I personally don&rsquo;t want to be lugging around a 10&rdquo; device to take pictures at the beach, etc.One thing I don&rsquo;t love is the charger. Once again, we as consumers, are required to have a proprietary charger made specifically for this device. It is not charged with a Micro USB, which really surprised me knowing Nokia (I have Nokia phones). But after reading about it, the reason behind the decision was not based on marketing but instead on technical function. Nokia claims that the 2520 can be fully charged from 10% to 100% in less than an hour. This could not be accomplished with a micro USB. Personally I have not tested the specific speed of charging but I will say that I noticed that it is fast. It is drastically faster than the Surface I would say slightly faster than a standard sized iPad and about the same as my Phone.The complaint I hear the most from users of Windows mobile devices is the lack of apps. And that is a valid complaint. The Lumia has thousands of apps available for it in the Microsoft store and it also has additional apps available (almost all for free) designed by Nokia. My thought is this&hellip; I have bought tons of apps for the iPad. But honestly most of them are junk, toys that are fun, gimmicky, or maybe serve a single purpose. That is not saying there are not GREAT iOS apps. There are tons of them. But seriously of the 60 quadrillion apps available in the Apple store I only use about 10 of them regularly. The Windows store does not have near the amount of apps available but I guess it does not bother me because on the Lumia I have MS Office, I have Netflix, I have a great music player, I have an awesome maps application, Facebook, Amazon, etc. The apps and games available may not have the numbers of Apple but they certainly have everything you could need (outside of apps that make fart sounds or have singing cats, etc.).So, that all being said, The 2520 has replaced all of my tablet devices. It is great for business as well as passing time. I guess the real proof is that I discontinued cell service on my iPads because I really don&rsquo;t use them anymore. Nokia has really created a nice device here.</p>

<p>I really wanted to like this. It is a functional notebook for business and personal business. The display is outstanding and I (unlike most people) like the Windows 8 interface. It is also very nice to have complete Microsoft office functionality. The Windows RT operating system limits the amount and types of Apps that are available. I didn&rsquo;t expect that to matter, but it is frustrating that any useful or even fun App that I see referenced somewhere is not available on here to try. The biggest issue though is that there are absolutely no accessories available. There is one case that I have that works fine. The Power Keyboard that was designed for this and is supposed to be fantastic is not available anywhere. I cannot find a car charger and currently Microsoft and Verizon are out of the wall charges so I can&rsquo;t even get a spare. I&rsquo;m not sure if they are going to get more. No power cord obviously renders this thing useless. It is a little more than 10 x 6 inches so it doesn&rsquo;t fit anywhere a &lsquo;standard&rsquo; tablet fits (notebooks, handbags, purses, etc.). Having 4G was a must and I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the money for the iPad Air and I&rsquo;m not a huge Apple fan, but I think I&rsquo;m going to buy an iPad after all of this! Sometimes it really is better to buy the most popular item out there - everything is made and built for the iPad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear global purchasers!The tablet is a great and wonderful device to own, BUT if your purchasing the Nokia Lumia 2520 for Verizon or AT&amp;T &ldquo;WITH OUT CONTRACT&rdquo; (aka RX-114) for use within your local network carrier the you might want to reconsider and purchase the &ldquo;RX-113&rdquo; aka global versionThe device I purchased (shown above) actually went to the Nokia Dealership service center and the device IS unlocked BUT the &ldquo;regional carrier unlock&rdquo; related to a CHIP inside the main board is LOCKED and theirs nothing you can do about this nor any Nokia worldwide dealership can do also!Either get yourself the RX-113 version to take full advantage of the 4G LTE functionality OR use the RX-114 on a &ldquo;4G Wifi Router&rdquo;&hellip;It is a great device once all the updates and your applications are installed and you&rsquo;ve fully moved your files to this device.Works and runs fine! No deep screen sleep issue as posted on the internet. I love it and will hopefully be purchasing a Huawei 4G wifi router to compliment my device and take advantage of the 4G LTE network&hellip;.Think before you buy!Have a great day and thank you for reading my post. Hope this will be of help to all of you out there!George Emile ToutounjiBeirut, Lebanon</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a well built computer best used as a netbook for web access but is perfect for students&hellip;if you get the OEM keyboard which has an additional battery and 2 USB ports. This runs Windows RT and as such does not run heavier programs, but it does run windows office programs like word and excel quite well. I own a Surface Pro 3 and a Samsung Galaxy Note 2014 and I would say that the quality of the Nokia is amazing compared to those two. It just feels sturdy&hellip;.very responsive and the camera is wonderful.</p>

<p>This product works fantastically in all respects except one - shortly after purchasing it the device stopped auto orienting the pages based on how you hold the tablet - the option for screen tilt is actually missing and nobody seems to be able to explain why or how to fix it.</p>

<p>I must confess it took a little bit to understand how to move around on it but once we firgured that out, it&rsquo;s a breeze. My husband is a Windows Administrator so we decided to go with the windows based unit, less of a learning curve. The only problem is I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to close an application once it&rsquo;s open.</p>
