<h5 id="won-t-fit-if-the-back-of-the-tv-isn-t-flush">Won&rsquo;t fit if the back of the TV isn&rsquo;t flush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with the mount itself however the screws that attach the bracket to the back of the TV are too short. I have a Samsung 32&rdquo; LED TV and it is not flush in the back, therefore we can&rsquo;t get the scews to screw all the way in. We waited too late to put the TV on the wall so it is too late to return the mount so we will have to look to purchase longer screws to make it work :-(<strong><em>Update</em></strong>After reading through other reviewers who complained about the same problem I decided to call EchoGear to request longer screws. I bumped my review up from 3 to 4 stars. They get 4 stars because customer service was friendly and she knew right away what type of TV I had and was familiar with the problem. They lost one star because they know about the problem with Samsung TVs so I think it should be noted in the description. Also, today is Saturday and I have to wait until Wednesday for the longer screws to delivered so no TV for me today!</p>

<h5 id="great-mount-thick-metal">Great Mount - Thick Metal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We mounted a 65&rdquo; SUHD Samsung TV to our stone fireplace with this mount, it works great! Get the tilt if you&rsquo;re mounting your TV high up, it&rsquo;s 100%worth it. I went back and forth between the slimmest non-tilt mount, slimmest tilt mount and this one. This one is about .5&rdquo;-.75&rdquo; more out from the wall than the &ldquo;slimmest&rdquo; tilt mount I found on Amazon, but I can&rsquo;t imagine being able to tuck our small satellite receiver behind the TV with anything else, the fit is TIGHT. QUALITY: The metal is thick, very sturdy. It does not flex, can&rsquo;t be happier and it looks great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tilt-adjustment-issues">Tilt adjustment issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mount is reasonably easy to install with clear instructions. However, the tilt adjustment does not work well. My TV is on the heavier side, probably close to the limit that this wall mount supports, but the tilt does not hold the TV and it tilts downward. I tried to remove the TV, tighten the adjustment screws again and remount, but still didn&rsquo;t work. The problem is that those screws are fastened by hand, not by tools and it seems that they don&rsquo;t provide enough grip for heavier TVs. If I didn&rsquo;t have to go through uninstalling everything, I would return it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-wall-mount-perfect-for-my-55-tv">Great Wall Mount! Perfect for my 55&rdquo; TV!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount is perfect for my 55&rdquo; LG TV - good quality and sturdy! My dad and husband set it up and had no issues at all! You can use ECOGEAR&rsquo;s website to find the exact model that will fit your TV - I almost bought the wrong one so I was happy with this feature. Would highly recommend, our TV looks great on the wall!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-and-easy-to-hang">Sturdy and easy to hang</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As advertised. It was easy to install. It helps to have the right tools. You&rsquo;ll want a drill and a <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> &ldquo; bit, which it states in the instructions. You&rsquo;re also going to need a long Phillips head screw driver. I used a ratchet extension, but that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s all I had. The way it&rsquo;s designed makes it really easy to line up with the studs. I installed it with no problems at all. Be sure to plug in any devices you are connecting to it before hanging it, because there is not much room to reach behind it once you get it into place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-freaking-perfect-for-what-i-wanted-to-do">So freaking perfect for what I wanted to do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So freaking perfect for what I wanted to do. I do wish that I got the one that swivels forward because it is difficult to get behind my TV. I have a 55 inch and highly recommend spending the extra money on the one that comes forward. Do not get me wrong, though, this thing is freaking solid and EASY to install.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-easy-to-setup-lcd-tv-mount">Simple easy to setup LCD TV mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first box was missing parts, it was delivered unsealed and looked like it had been opened, we had to return it to Amazon which is always an easy experience though we haven&rsquo;t had to do much of that over the years. The second box had everything we needed and setup was a cinch, and the TV was up in about 45 min. I removed a star for the pain of having to return and re-order, they need to do a better job at packaging, otherwise the product was exactly what was expected</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-sturdy-and-well-designed">Very sturdy and well-designed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this to mount my ginormous LG 55&rdquo; (55LH90). It&rsquo;s a 6 year old 80 pound back-lit beast, very bulky for an LED set.This mount is rated for 125 lbs but tested for 500 lbs, so I had confidence in going through with this. Just for my own piece of mind, I tried grabbing it and hanging from the mount myself after putting it on the wall and before hanging the TV. I do <em>not</em> suggest trying this, fyi, as a person&rsquo;s weight distribution and leverage against the mount is different from a TV&rsquo;s. But for what it&rsquo;s worth, it felt rock-solid.Toughest part is, as with anything like this, finding the wall studs and their center. I have an electric stud finder and got mixed readings, making this a chore, but that&rsquo;s obviously not a knock on this mount. It <em>is</em> important to get close to stud centers, though, as the bolts that anchor this mount are pretty large.It would also be helpful if it came with a cardboard template of the mount to make all that pre-work of marking its spot on the wall easier.Once all that is done, putting the brackets on the TV is simple (use your TV manual to figure out the proper screw size&hellip;many are included to accommodate). Then, just set the tilt angle of the brackets. Hanging it is laughably simple, so removing it to reset the angle is pretty easy. It took 2 people with my TV but it only took seconds.There are screws on the bottom of the brackets that need to be tightened in order to help maintain the TV&rsquo;s position, and they can be hard to reach. However, a long screw driver is all you need, and not much leverage is necessary as they don&rsquo;t have to be terribly tight.All in all I spent 90% of my time just figuring out the studs and hanging location. Actual installation was a breeze.</p>
