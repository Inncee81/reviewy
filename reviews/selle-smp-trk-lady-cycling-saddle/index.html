<p>The Selle SMP TRK Lady bike saddle is designed for those of you ladies who do lots of riding on the trainer or commuting to work. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s engineered for maximum breathability which is great if you&rsquo;re going to be sweating buckets on the trainer or riding in regular clothes instead of cycling shorts. And, of course, the Selle SMP shape helps increase blood flow and more efficiently distribute body weight so you don&rsquo;t suffer from numbness, soreness or the need to wiggle around in the saddle. SMP Vacuum Tech (SVT) cover for comfort and durability Soft polyurethane padding holds comfort when seated for extended periods such as on an indoor trainer All Selle SMP saddles feature a unique, &ldquo;beak&rdquo; saddle nose that acts as a flat base for efforts while sitting during long climbs; and as a relief during the descents, offering better control of the bike with the thighs Raised rear gives saddle a more aerodynamic shape for those times when speed is the name of the game Endorsed by physicians as a saddle that limits compression on the pelvic floor for increased stability and a lower, more comfortable position on competitive rides Extra wide, central channel eliminates pressure in sensitive areas up front and in the rear Lots of foamed elastomer padding throughout the saddle and a breathable synthetic cover ensure ultimate comfort Tubular steel rails add durability</p>

<h5 id="the-lady-selle-is-slightly-wider">The Lady Selle is Slightly Wider</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Selle SMP-TRK saddle is one of my favorites. I prefer them in the brown color, as that color is so similar to the Brooks leather saddles in appearance. Unfortunately, there are times when you can find this Selle saddle in almost any color but the brown. It was during one of these periods of non-availability of the brown color that I ordered the &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; version, which was available in brown when the men&rsquo;s version was not. I took a chance.When this Lady Selle arrived, I measured it carefully. I laid it on top of one of my examples of the Selle men&rsquo;s versions for a direct comparison. The length is the same, exactly. The forward neck areas of both saddles are the same. The difference is in the width of the widest dimension in the rear of the saddle. The Lady Selle is maybe three-eighths of an inch wider &ndash; nearly an inconsequential difference, it would seem.With the men&rsquo;s version installed on one bike and the Lady Selle on another bike, I was able to experience the difference in saddles as I alternated bikes during the next couple of weeks. I still like the men&rsquo;s version, but I think I slightly prefer the Lady Selle, as the points of my pelvic sit bones are glancing off the outside edges of the men&rsquo;s version, while the points of my sit bones feel more squarely atop the pads of the Lady Selle. I buy my pre-shrunk Levis in 36X36 size. If others reading this review buy pants with a 32 inch waist, I suspect you might do as well with the men&rsquo;s version of the Selle SMP-TRK.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-breezy-technology">Beautiful Breezy Technology</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A running injury has me on a MTB for the first time in a decade. I switched out the original saddle on my bike for a wider comfort seat. The saddle I ordered off Amazon was a good quality seat, but was too wide and caused chaffing. (I will gift that saddle to my neighbor.) I am so happy to have found this Selle SMP TRK lady saddle on Amazon. I love the beautiful technology. It fits my anatomy perfectly. My lady parts feel free and breezy. The guys at the bike shop had never seen a saddle like this. The were impressed by the anti-crushing design. I&rsquo;ve been biking 17-20 miles daily, as I rehab my knee. This saddle makes for a more comfortable ride. I don&rsquo;t experience any chaffing. Still, I wish the saddle had a tad bit more gel or memory foam for the sit bones. However, as it is, the saddle cushion is very supportive. Love it.</p>

<h5 id="a-life-saver-for-me">A life saver for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had years of struggles with saddles and hoped this one would work out. Initially, it wasn&rsquo;t working but when I researched the set up I found that I didn&rsquo;t have it set back far enough. Once I got it dialed in it felt really good. I rode it for 62 miles and found that the pain I had been experiencing substantially diminished to the point where I could concentrate on the ride. I found that at times, the seat disappeared under me and I had never had that happen before. I had some hot spots around mile 55 but that&rsquo;ll happen on long rides and it did go away.I got the lady saddle because it was a little wider and I initially thought getting a wider saddle might help but if/when I ever give up trying to break in my Brooks B17 on my other bike, I&rsquo;ll get the men&rsquo;s version of this saddle,.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must">A Must!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My favorite seat. I bought one for our tandem and loved it so much, I bought one for my road bike. My first experience with this seat was a 300 mile bike ride. It arrived 2 days before starting our trip, so I decided to try it out and I loved it. While everyone else was saddle sore, I was not! It has a great width for women&rsquo;s sit bones. The contour shape provides more support and the air channel gives needed air flow.</p>

<h5 id="it-seems-pretty-good-for-me">It seems pretty good for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems pretty good for me. I have a road bike and ride slow, a max of 40 miles. I wear padded bike shorts too. Like many have said, it is a matter of what bike seat is comfortable for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-saddle">Good saddle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good saddle. I used this to replace a too-squishy hybrid saddle that was comfortable for shorter rides but produced too much friction on rides much over 10-12 miles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Reconditioned arrived in perfect condition. Incredibly comfortable on long rides. Best saddle I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-wide-in-thighs">Too Wide In Thighs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This had a lot of cushion. Unfortunately I had to return it as it was too wide in between my thighs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="much-better-for-the-lady-parts">Much better for the lady parts.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for my lady parts. Took all of the pressure from my girl goodies. Rubs and hurts a bit on my sit bones due to a wider front section, but much better than the pressure in&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a new biker I was really struggling with the pain. But this seat fixed that. Make riding a whole lot more enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-me-and-my-bum">Works for me, and my bum</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great saddle and a nice improvement over the stock saddle that came with my bike. I trained for and rode the MS150 using this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very comfortable seat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-with-it-so-might-need-another-for-bike-2">Happy with it&hellip;so might need another for bike #2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really thought I would want or need the gel model but chose this one because it was at the right price point.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-saddle">Best Saddle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best saddle I&rsquo;ve ever owned. No more low back pain or pubic bone pain. Wish I had discovered this sooner!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-gone-through-several-seats-and-none-seemed-to">I have gone through several seats and none seemed to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have gone through several seats and none seemed to work until I got this one!! It&rsquo;s changed my ride completely</p>
