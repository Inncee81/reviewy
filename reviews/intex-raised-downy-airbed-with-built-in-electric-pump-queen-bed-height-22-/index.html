<p>Product Description
The Raised Downy Airbed is engineered with dual chamber construction: the lower chamber functions as the box spring form on a traditional bed, providing extra firmness and support while the upper chamber functions as a mattress. It provides the convenience of a portable airbed with the comfort of sleeping on a raised platform. Plush, waterproof flocking covers the mattress top for a luxurious feel to provide a cozy night&rsquo;s sleep. The Raised Downey is equipped with a quality-tested, 20.8-gauge waterproof flocked top, along with 15-gauge vinyl beams and 16-gauge sides and bottom. The resulting surface is comfortable and secure, whether you&rsquo;re sleeping at the in-laws&rsquo; overcrowded house or setting up a guest bed in the basement.</p>

<p>In addition, the Pillow Rest is remarkably easy to inflate thanks to the built-in, high-powered electric pump; quickly and easily inflate both chambers with the touch of a switch. Then adjust to any level of firmness for the ultimate in comfort. The airbed inflates in about 4 and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> minutes and deflates completely for travel and storage. No more fussing with tiring hand or foot pumps or rummaging through the garage for your detached electric pump. And should the mattress feel a little too soft or firm, you can customize the comfort level with the touch of a button. An indentation on the side helps grip fitted sheets so you can feel comfortable in the bedspread you already have.</p>

<p>Regarding Inflation: Measurements will vary based on the manner in which it is inflated and packaging disclaims “approximate size”. Airbeds are measured from the widest point including the beams (bulges) on the side and off the tallest point from the floor including built-in pillows if applicable. Location, temperature, and humidity will affect the airbed’s firmness. Airbeds will need to be occasionally re-inflated (topped off) to maintain desired firmness when used for more than a few days as vinyl tends to relax over time</p>

<h5 id="now-a-beach-ball">Now a beach ball</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great idea but poor quality. The chambers continue to break; the bed is now a giant beach ball after 9 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-this-air-mattress-shoddy-construction">Do not buy this air mattress - shoddy construction.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the lengthwise seams came unglued on this bed rendering absolutely useless after owning it about 2 months. Amazon does not cover this product after 30 days, and Intex offers absolutely NO warranty on their air mattresses. This is because they know they have poor product construction. Yes, this bed was incredibly comfortable (delaying my bed purchasing for 2 months!) but that Intex doesn&rsquo;t even offer a limited warranty against manufacturing defects speaks to how reliable they feel their products are.I&rsquo;m not the only person that has had this issue - I wish I had clicked on other pictures before I bought this bed. For what it&rsquo;s worth I had no other issues with the bed&hellip;it was comfortable and held air very well. In the 2 months that my girlfriend and I slept on the air mattress we filled it up probably 4 times total. It was more comfortable than the aerobed that I slept on, and I really wish it would have lasted us longer or that Intex would have replaced it. I think it&rsquo;s a really poor customer service model to set - instead of having a negative experience I would have come back to Amazon and written how well Intex took care of me and replaced my bed without question. Instead, they get a 1-star review and a long-winded review about how horrible the customer service is with this company.In the long run it&rsquo;s a few dollars saved at the cost of a horribly negative review. If there are any other companies looking at this review the take-home lesson is that if you take care of your customers you develop a loyal base that will always speak well of your products. Now, when one of my friends asks me about air beds I will have only one response &ldquo;not Intex,&rdquo; rather than championing the company.I hope this gets read - I very rarely leave negative reviews, but I feel like this is something that needs to be addressed.</p>

<h5 id="poor-quality-inside">poor quality inside.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Same beach ball situation as others have posted. There&rsquo;s a picture of one that is half blown, half not. Mine is exactly like this, except I bought it TWO months ago.Update: just found out there is NO warranty on this product. No warranty, none, zero.Other reviewers seem to have the same issue I do, which tells me this is a fairly common defect, considering we all have the same complaint.Amazon, why have you not told this manufacturer to improve their quality?The bed is useless, the internal baffles (as another reviewer posted) broke. My bed looks like a balloon.Very dissatisfied. Not buying from this company again, definitely not making the mistake of replacing this one with another one from the same manufacturer, as other reviewers have done. Might even call in to amazon to complain. Two months of occasional use should not cause this thing to break like this.</p>

<h5 id="best-one">Best One</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: the bubble didn&rsquo;t appear in the bed until almost October. Had no issues prior to that. The bubble is simply from my boyfriend moving and other people flopping on the bed. If not for that it&rsquo;d still be in perfect condition.I ordered this air mattress back in May this year. It&rsquo;s gotten almost constant use over the weekends of over 300lbs and after Hurricane Irma hit my boyfriend and I have slept on this one ever sense for going on 2 months straight every night. Well over 300lbs on it every night. Still hasn&rsquo;t lost air and up until last night the air bubble it had wasn&rsquo;t big, but with all the moving my boyfriend does it made the air bubble bigger. Still doesn&rsquo;t lose any air just someone has to sleep on the bubble now. I would definitely recommend this air mattress it doesn&rsquo;t lose air and lasts for a long time. We can still use it after the house is fixed from the flooding. We&rsquo;ve used other from beauty rest and other brands and all of them lost air after the first night or came with a hole in them.</p>

<h5 id="super-comfy-very-reliable-great-price">Super Comfy&hellip;Very Reliable&hellip;Great Price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: I got this on Amazon and the price was about $16 less than it is showing as I write this review. The price varies considerably so if you don&rsquo;t need it straight away, I&rsquo;d put it in your cart, click save for later, and then buy it when the price drops again.I recently had to get a city apartment because of a transfer where I stay during the times that I&rsquo;m working. I am home when I&rsquo;m not. That means I had to furnish the city apartment with things from home without disturbing my family&rsquo;s comfort or needs. I decided to take a guest bed that we haven&rsquo;t been using for a while but that used to be my regular bed some years ago. The catch was, I wouldn&rsquo;t have things for the first week I was there before the mover&rsquo;s came. Enter my need for an airbed.I&rsquo;m a huge Amazon shopper because of the reviews and this is the one I chose based on those reviews. There is always some risk when purchasing anything that has to hold air, of course, but I wasn&rsquo;t at all disappointed. Quite the reverse!This thing is tall! You can&rsquo;t really see if from the pictures but this mattress is about the height of a mattress and box springs put on the floor without a frame. It&rsquo;s also super easy to put up. Just plug it in and turn it on. Voila&hellip;two minutes later a fully inflated bed. I slept on it very, very comfortably during that first week while waiting for the movers. I felt just fine waking up and going to work with not a single sore spot. Slept like a baby.After my household goods arrived and I was all set up, I naturally moved onto the bed I brought in the master bedroom. Uhh&hellip;yeah&hellip;I&rsquo;ve apparently changed (gotten a few crucial years older) since I last used that bed. I was miserable on the real bed. So much so that I moved back into the smaller bedroom with the air mattress! That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been since. There&rsquo;s no question that I sigh with relief when I get home and use my regular bed on my trips home, but I&rsquo;d have to say that this air mattress is a very close second in comfort.I was home for 3 weeks and left the air mattress up and when I returned to the city apartment, I figured it would be at least a little deflated. Nope. Still perfectly inflated! And I tried the regular bed again and was miserable again&hellip;so still on the air mattress. To fix the problem, I&rsquo;ve ordered a gel and memory foam thick topper for the regular bed from here on Amazon and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll review and see if it makes it livable, but until then, I&rsquo;m super happy with this mattress.</p>
