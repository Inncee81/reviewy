<h5 id="exquisite-laptop-carrying-bag">Exquisite laptop carrying bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I ordered this computer bag, I was doubtful that I would be of very high quality. My, oh my, was I wrong. This is a very high quality bag. It has no discernible flaws in construction, and its design for multiple uses is clearly evident. The high-quality leather sets is apart from any other computer bag I have ever seen. I feel like I am carrying a bag that normally would cost hundreds of dollars. Its soft interior protects my computer quite nicely, and it has much room to spare for other items. Especially important to me is the fact that I can carry other items on the inside of the bag and not worry about their scratching the delicate surface of my MacBook Pro. The specially designed separate interior provides a center divider to keep all other items safely away from the computer and at the same time leaves ample room to carry anything I can imagine that anyone would want to carry. As additional well-designed features, zippered pockets are included on the inside and and outside for smaller items that one needs to keep from moving about in the larger interior compartments. Moreover, the outside also features easily accessible strap-covered pockets for frequently needed items such as a cell phone, a calculator, and other such things.I highly recommend this well-designed, ultimate-quality laptop carrying case. I cannot imagine that anyone would be disappointed in owning and using this bag on a daily basis. It is designed to be used, and at the same time it makes its own clear statement about quality construction. Do not hesitate to purchase this bag and put it to use. I believe you will not be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-disappointed">I am disappointed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Within 1 month of purchasing this back, the strap broke. The metal clip on the strap which attaches to the bag broke under the weight of 1 laptop. I am disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality">Great quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this bag. It is high quality and fashionable. There are many pockets, zippers, and storage areas. A nice sectioned off protected area for your PC as well. I will be traveling a lot and am very happy to have one bag to use for all of my work and personal belongings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-with-a-drawback">Good, but with a drawback</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great bag. It looks professional, seems very durable, and feels lovely to touch. It feels like I&rsquo;m about to embark on some Indiana Jones movie at any moment. I have a Surface Pro 4 with a type cover and battery, a Spectre X360 15.6&rdquo; with a 12 foot charger, a car charger, and some other goodies. It fits, though it is tight.One thing I would warn any potential buyers: it doesn&rsquo;t have a carrying handle. So although it&rsquo;s plenty large, you need to use the strap. I wish I&rsquo;d known that before I bought it, but no such luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it-there-s-only-two-small-things-i-would">I love it! There&rsquo;s only two small things i would &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it! There&rsquo;s only two small things i would change. One, it needs a handle. You have the shoulder strap, which works for 99% of the time, but it needs the handle for the other 1%, The only other thing I would like to change, is even less of an issue is, the buckle in front, the side has a snap where the buckle is, but the front is an actual buckle. Not a snap. I would personally prefer a snap like the side. But over anything, it needs a handle, not all the time do i need the fulll shoulder handle, like even lifting the bag, i need a handle. If you can deal with no handle, this bag is perfect. I still give it 5 stars, even with the handle lol. That&rsquo;s how much I love this bag :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy customer!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so thrilled to receive my bag 2 weeks ago. It came securely wrapped and included a nice reusable draw string bag. There were no marks on the leather. This bag is everything I have been looking for in a quality messenger bag. It is very sleek and vintage looking as advertised. It&rsquo;s a nice size with plenty of room to keep all your belongings. A 15&rdquo; laptop fits with ease and my SG6 fits snug in the side pocket. Many prefer to have a handle attached and I would agree but I am still very satisfied with the bag. The buckle doesn&rsquo;t have a snap feature to open the flap like other laptop messenger bags. I feel the buckle provides better security and having a zipper also adds some extra security. All in all I am very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-stylish-durable-bag">Good, stylish &amp; durable bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned this bag for about 3 months+ and have used it as my office bag with a heavy 15.6&rdquo; HP laptop and accessories. The bag is well constructed and has nice soft lining on the inside. There is a lot of space in the accessory pockets too. I really like the overall design and build quality of the bag and have received a lot of compliments as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-bag-but-the-strap-broke-on-first-use">Nice bag, but the strap broke on first use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I do like the bag; it is made from great material and it&rsquo;s roomy. Unfortunately, the first time I took it to class, the shoulder strap broke. Since I like the bag, I ordered a replacement. Let&rsquo;s hope it was a fluke.</p>
