<p>Style:Rosewood Body  |  Size:Dreadnought  |  Color:Natural  |  Configuration:Guitar
The solid Sitka Spruce top and rosewood body are topped with a beautiful high-gloss natural finish. The piezo/preamp system with a 3-band EQ, adjustable midrange frequency control, and built-in chromatic tuner give you the tools to shape your plugged-in performances. The FGX730SC acoustic guitar offers great features, including a cutaway body with a Solid Sitka Spruce top, rosewood back and sides, and a rosewood fingerboard in a beautiful hi-gloss natural finish. With FGX730SC you have the option of plugging into a PA or amp with a 1-way piezo/preamp system with a 3-band EQ, adjustable midrange frequency control, and built-in chromatic tuner. Acoustically or plugged in, the FGX730SC sounds fantastic. A.R.T. technology uses unique multilayer structuring and achieves optimum dynamic balance. Yamaha acoustic-electric guitars have consistently used piezoelectric pickups to reproduce the pure sounds of the acoustic guitar. But piezoelectric pickups tended to overreact to changes in attack, which, in turn, caused distortion. To achieve ideal playability, Yamaha improved the way the dynamics were controlled on the FJX730SC acoustic electric. The guitar pickup was designed with a multilayer structure consisting of six layers of different materials. This dampens excessive vibration from the top board while picking up small resonances to achieve ideal sensitivity and outstanding dynamic balance. Also, because the pickup is fitted directly beneath the top board, it functions as a transducer attached to the guitar body. In addition to two main pickups mounted under the saddle, this system has one each on the bass and treble sides to capture the vibrations of the entire length of the strings and body, as well as the sound&rsquo;s bass and treble components. The Yamaha guitar&rsquo;s pickups are laid out in such a way as to achieve clear reproduction even during high-position soloing. The A.R.T. preamp system&rsquo;s 1-way configuration features one main pickup system consisting of two pickups &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="mine">Mine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The most well made, best sounding guitar I have ever owned. And I have owned guitars that cost two even three times as much. It just sounds better. The action is perfect right out of the box. I didn&rsquo;t even have to replace the strings it came with, like I&rsquo;ve had to with every other guitar I have ever bought. One of the best things I have ever bought. It will be my forevery baby.</p>

<h5 id="best-quality-guitar-for-the-money">Best quality Guitar for the money!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this guitar. I have been learning as a newbie over the last several months on a loaned guitar and wanted one I could call my own. After months of research I landed on this one. I do not regret it!!! The sound quality from the solid wood top makes a huge difference over the low end laminate guitars. From the first strum it sounded beautiful. The guitar came well set up, with the action nice and low. The neck is straight, frets nice and smooth without rough edges and the strings are decent quality. I will swap them out soon enough for personal preference. The onboard tuner worked great for about a 2 week and stopped working completely. It would be nice for it to work but I use a tuner on my smartphone, if necessary.My only complaint is the picture does not match the description. The picture that I ordered looked like the brown SANDBURST finish which is a light brown but the description says brown sunburst, which is orange-ish around the sound hole and turns a dark brown around the edges. The finish is still beautiful but was not what I originally thought I was ordering. The guitar sounded so good I decided it was not work the hassle of attempting to swap out.I highly recommend this guitar for any new beginners, intermediate, and even seasoned players. The quality that Yamaha produces is outstanding.</p>

<h5 id="10-10-would-buy-again"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would buy again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is the first review that I have written on an Amazon product in the 5 years that I have been a prime member and ordered alot of stuff. This guitar is by far the best purchase I have made.After looking at a few other acoustics in the price point I landed on this one after reading other reviews.First off, the build quality is extremely high, though I did notice a little bit of excess dried glue where the neck meets the body on the back side. I&rsquo;m some what of a pessimist when it comes to making bigger purchases online without feeling them and looking at them. The look and feel of this guitar makes me wonder how it can be at this low of a price point.The sound is full and rich. I&rsquo;d compare it to my brother in law&rsquo;s Taylor 410 though I don&rsquo;t have a professional ear for the little nuances of sound. I&rsquo;m an intermediate player with a few years of off and on experience and am extremely satisfied with my purchase.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this guitar to anyone looking for a quality product with amazing sound and features at this price point.</p>

<h5 id="nice-warm-sounds">Nice, warm sounds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A nice mid-line instrument for someone who is serious about playing and doesn&rsquo;t want to start on a cheaper model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-can-t-be-beat-for-the-price">Absolutely can&rsquo;t be beat for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really well made and for $299 you just can&rsquo;t beat this guitar. Decently low action without any fret buzz. Came well setup, really smooth tone, decently loud for a smaller guitar as well. I have been playing electric for 16 years, I thought it was time to own an acoustic! Not disappointed at all!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this guitar for my son who has played electric guitar for three years and has transitioned to acoustic. We wanted a decent guitar but something not too expensive as this is still more of a hobby. After researching and reading favorable reviews about this guitar we decided to make the purchase. My son is very happy with it and is using it to play in the teen choir at church.</p>
