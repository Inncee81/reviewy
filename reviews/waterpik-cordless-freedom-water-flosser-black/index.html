<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="mold-due-to-major-design-flaw-see-pics-bad-customer-service-response">Mold due to Major Design flaw (see pics), bad customer service response</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved Waterpik products, but this reservoir doesn&rsquo;t have a way of fully draining because there is an elevated lip at the opening latch and spot where the tube inserts. You have to clean it regularly but over time the tube and unscrubbable reservoir bottom developed black mold. Customer service still has yet to replace the reservoir as promised by email, weeks later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">LOVE it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, this thing is AMAZING!! I just can&rsquo;t say enough great things about it. I&rsquo;m so glad I got this one as opposed to the rechargeable one. I&rsquo;ve read reviews about the charging connection on rechargeable one becoming corroded since the socket is on the side and gets water and residue in it. The battery door on this flosser is on the bottom and has a door so no worries about water getting inside. You can also use this one in the shower if you want. If you use the tip that comes with this flosser, the water reservoir will only last about 30 seconds and you&rsquo;ll need to refill once. This isn&rsquo;t a big deal, but just so you know. However, I ordered the Waterpik Pocket Pik tip (which fits this model just fine, btw) and had a nice surprise. Not only does the Pocket Pic tip work perfectly, it slows down the action of the flosser and now the reservoir lasts a full minute!! Now I can spend more time aiming the flosser in the perfect direction and not worry about running out of water before I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<h5 id="my-new-addiction">My new addiction!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this thing. Totally addicted. I have molar pockets that brushing and floss can&rsquo;t access. All I gotta say is&hellip;. it&rsquo;s nasty what comes out. And the smell. Ugh! But that was only the first time. If used regularly it&rsquo;s not nasty. Gums can bleed a little at first. But that&rsquo;s the same w floss. It lessens with time if you use it regularly.</p>

<h5 id="throw-away-the-floss-you-need-a-waterpik">Throw away the floss, you NEED a Waterpik</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should get this out there right now. I have never been the best brusher nor the best flosser. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you are the same way or we wouldn&rsquo;t have so many dentists to choose from. I&rsquo;m a once a night brusher and once a never flosser. The idea of a waterpik intrigued me. Flossing without the pain in the butt string? Flossing without the plastic flossers getting stuck in my teeth?If you are like me with your brushing habits, be warned, your first time with the Waterpik will be an eye opener. The first few times you should expect some blood from your gum line. Actually, you should expect a lot of blood. Rinse well and use some mouthwash. After about a week, your gums will become stronger and their will be no more or very little blood.Setting up and using the Waterpik is easy. Open the hatch and pour in the water (not too cold). Make sure to lean over the sink to let the water flow out and start with the pik in your mouth. Unless you like a wet bathroom. Start with the lowest setting for a week or so and trace your gum line from one side to the other, sliding up slightly between each tooth.Amazed is the best word to describe what I saw come out from between my teeth. I honestly believe a piece of floss would not be enough. The flow of water lasts 30 seconds. When your still getting used to the Waterpik, you will have to refill for your top row of teeth. Once you get the motions down, you can do all of your teeth in this time.I have seen a huge improvement in how clean my gum line looks and how clean between my teeth are. The outcome is similar to when you get a professional cleaning (in these areas only). I suggest brushing after using the Waterpik and not the other way around. then using mouthwash.The lowest setting is plenty strong. Considering this a cordless device, that&rsquo;s quite the feat. I can&rsquo;t wait to see the results 3-6 months later. The products promises results in 14 days. They are not exaggerating. There are two Waterpik heads so you can share with your significant other. Plus included is a head for cleaning braces. There are other heads you can purchase that will fit.If you hate flossing, you must give this Waterpik a try. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it-it-is-small-enough-that-i-have">I like it. It is small enough that I have &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it. It is small enough that I have room for it on the shelf below my bathroom mirror and above the sink. It seems to get out particles stuck between my teeth which I cannot always get out with dental floss.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comes-with-two-speeds-high-and-higher">Comes with two speeds - high and higher</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Waterpik Cordless Water Flosser uses 3 AA batteries. The model I received came with three tips, two of which appear to be the classic jet tips and one is the orthodontic tip for use with braces. The instructions were good and pretty easy to understand. I choose the classic jet tip.I have a Hydro Floss water flosser and the Waterpik Cordless model felt bulkier and a little more difficult to get it to spray exactly where I wanted it. As the water tank drains it changes the weight of the Waterpick. The main thing that I didn&rsquo;t like was that the Hydro Floss has a dial to change the pressure of the water spray so you can select any pressure level. The Waterpik Cordless has a switch with 2 settings. It&rsquo;s supposed to be low and high speed, but it was more like high speed and higher speed. Waterpik states that the spray is gentle, but even on low speed it wasn&rsquo;t very gentle. It was somewhat uncomfortable against the gums. There was not very much difference between the low and high speeds. On the low speed it took less than 50 seconds to empty the water tank. On the high speed it took just over 40 seconds to empty the water tank. So the difference was negligible and you may have to refill the tank to complete your water flossing.</p>

<h5 id="cleans-well-but-has-a-short-life">Cleans Well But Has a Short Life</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It worked quite well for flossing after brushing and came with extra tips. I have had it since July 2016. A few days ago it stopped working. I thought it was the batteries, but I had changed them a few weeks before. I changed batteries again but it just does not work. Too bad, I really liked that it made my mouth feel fresh and I didn&rsquo;t have to use floss which sometimes got stuck between my teeth. I was careful to open the latch after using to air any trapped moisture and also set it on a wash cloth away from the sink when it was not used so water on the counter would not get into the battery area.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meh">Meh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Eh. Its ok? The water pressure isn&rsquo;t quite what I was hoping; I wish it were stronger. I recently got braces and my dentist suggested a waterpik to help with cleaning in addition to brushing/flossing, and I&rsquo;m not super impressed with this? Its fine, but could be better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didn-t-last-long">Didnâ€™t last long&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked fine while it lasted. Broke after 8 months of occasional use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use. Not sure if it&rsquo;s effective as advertised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-be-useful">Can be useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only used this product once. I am currently having some dental work done and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to fairly rate this product until I&rsquo;ve used it a few times.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars-1">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>not as powerful as expected and water chamber small, but what did I expect, it is a travel item!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="water-pic-reservoir-loose">Water pic reservoir loose.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works OK, but the reservoir clip does not hold the reservoir in place. One must hold it in place while using the water pic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wonderful">Wonderful!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful! My husband is a believer in the waterpik now! It does a great job, but the batteries died quickly for some reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-longer-working">No longer working.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just came home from a 4 week trip. This was working before I left home. Now it has completely stopped working. changed batteries&ndash;nothing. It just plain stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is great. works very well</p>

<h5 id="this-product-is-great-to-keep-a-clean-mouth-and-he-loves-it">this product is great to keep a clean mouth and he loves it</h5>
