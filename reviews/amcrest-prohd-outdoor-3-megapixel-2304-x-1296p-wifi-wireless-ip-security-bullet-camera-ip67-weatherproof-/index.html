<blockquote>
<p> I was looking for a replacement for my old IP camera because of its unreliable performance so I purchased this Amcrest ProHD Outdoor 3-Megapixel WiFi Wireless IP Security Bullet Camera after doing my research on Amazon. I&rsquo;m looking for an IP camera that can provide consistent monitoring with HD quality and this camera does meet my needs.The package includes Amcrest IP3M-943W, power adapter, WIFI antenna, IP camera wall mounting kit, Ethernet cable, and user manual. Amcrest IP3M-943W is waterproof rated at IP67, which means that it is fully protected from dust (6) and can also withstand being submerged in 1m (about 3.3 feet) of static water for up to 30 mins (7) so it should last throw rains without a problem. There are many IR LEDs to help night vision and it&rsquo;s claimed to do up to 98 feet at night. I don&rsquo;t need to check that far but I am able to see 30 feet away from my front door clearly at night. The mounting kit includes both anchors and screws and Amcrest youtube channel clearly shows how to install the unit. I like that it come with a long and high quality WIFI antenna to ensure stable network connection. Be note that this unit doesn&rsquo;t have pan/tile features and angle adjustment is made manually on the unit itself. There was no memory card included in my package so I had to supply my own.Installation:Hardware wise, I just had to open up the memory card slot by unscrew 2 screws. After inserting memory card and finishing first-time setup, I just had to mount the unit and point it to where I want to capture. Connect it to power using the included power adapter and it&rsquo;s ready to go. Do note that there are 2 ways to mount the unit, one is to hide the wire inside the wall (wiring container is included) and the other is leave the wire exposed.Software wise, Amcrest does a good job helping user to setup. The quick start guide is clear and I followed the instruction to install &ldquo;Amcrest View Pro&rdquo; app onto my smartphone/tablet for an easier setup. By scanning QR code on the IP camera itself, the app could allocate the camera through serial number and connect to it to finalize network setup (Pick the desired wireless AP and password). After that, the app can quickly access the camera&rsquo;s live view. I&rsquo;d recommend using wired Ethernet cable setup method to setup to avoid complications. Please see my video for a short walk-through.PROs:- High quality video with minimal delay. When viewing the live view in SD quality, the video has almost no delay and it has less than 1 second delay when in HD mode. Please note latency also depends on the quality of the network this IP camera connected to.- User friendly setup and fast customer support. I was trying to setup using wireless method first time and couldn&rsquo;t get it to work because my home network configuration is very complicated. I contacted Amcrest support and they helped me go through it easily using the wired way. I also found there are a lot of tutorials on Youtube regarding Amcrest IP camera.- Amcrest cloud support and free dyndns. Amcrest IP camera comes with free 4 hour cloud recording and free dynamic dns service. Do note that the free cloud recording is limited to 1 camera per account unless you upgrade to paid membership. Dynamic dns is a very handy service if you&rsquo;re trying to access the camera from outside home network without a static IP.- Third party IP camera app support. I use Tinycam monitor as my main IP cam app and I found Amcrest camera is supported in the default device list. I forwarded the HTTP port and RTSP port and it&rsquo;s ready in my Tinycam monitor app. By default it also has iOS/Android app support and live view/setup can be done through browser on PC as well.- Built-in notification alert if you choose to use Amcrest View Pro app. I setup email alert with motion detection because I prefer this way.- Ultra HD resolution. It supports 2304×1296 with H.264 Compression. It&rsquo;s even higher than 1080P.Note:- Amcrest IP3M-943 only supports 2.4GHz WIFI frequency. No 5GHz support. WEP, WPA, WPA2 Encryptions are supported though.- I would recommend setup the camera first time with memory card slot cover removed because status indicator LEDs are located INSIDE the cover and that&rsquo;s the only way to see if the unit is running/ connecting/ connected/ off.Overall it&rsquo;s a very solid IP camera and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for ultra HD video quality and has no need for pan/tilt features.</p>

<h5 id="good-picture-quality-and-good-set-of-features">Good picture quality and good set of features.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my 2nd unit. I bought the first one because I wanted an IP camera that has two critical feature I care about: 1) has a SD to store video in situations where there is no wifi. The video is saved on SD and I can view later. I haven&rsquo;t tested this yet, but the feature is there when I need it (if wifi goes down). 2) This camera can be configured to save video using FTP (and NAS). This means the remote camera can save to my own FTP site (or my own NAS server) rather than needing to pay/subscribe to some video cloud storage service. This feature works well.Video quality is very good. Features like motion detect are good as well as the ability to get email notifications of motion detect is great. I have the email go to my verizon vtext.com email address which then causes me to get a text message of motion.Negatives (minor to me, but maybe not to you&hellip;):1) The video stored on my FTP server is a bunch of .mp4 video files in a logical directory structure. However, there&rsquo;s no app that organized the videos in an easy way to view. You literally have to use windows explorer and navigate to the .mp4 files and view them by clicking each individually. this is not a big deal if you do not look at the video often.2) The camera can be accessed/setup via chrome browser by typing in the ip address of the camera. This gives access to configuation type menus. Great! However, if you want to hav a &ldquo;live&rdquo; view of the camera, you have to install a chrome plugin from amcrest. not a big deal. HOWEVER, the plugin doesn&rsquo;t now enable the video to show up on the chrome browser window. Instead, it allows you to launch a &ldquo;chrome app&rdquo; where the camera menus can be navigated and live view viewed. So to run the app you have to go to Chrome&rsquo;s &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; menu (took me forever to find it) and then click on the Amcrest app link, then you can log in and get all the features. I don&rsquo;t understand why I can&rsquo;t just type in the IP address of the camera and get all the features as the app. Annoying, but ultimately it works.3) There IS an Amcrest Android App. However, it&rsquo;s useless unless you have a cloud account with them. I was hoping it would allow me to view the camera live from my phone just on my wifi net or if I opened up ports on my router, but I didn&rsquo;t see a way to do that. You have to have a cloud account with AMCREST. So do you homework if you hope this will have feature rich smartphone support. I&rsquo;m disappointed in this area, but that&rsquo;s not why I bought it.So I bought my first camera to test and make sure it had the features I wanted. My goal is to replace my dedicated anlog camera DVR system with ip cameras that store on my home NAS server. Now that I know it meets my needs, I bought a second and plan to buy more.</p>
