<h5 id="kitchenaid-diamond-blender-1575-vs-the-classic-1570-the-diamond-wins">Kitchenaid Diamond Blender (1575) vs the Classic (1570)&hellip; the Diamond Wins!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was torn between the Kitchenaid Diamond and the Kitchenaid Classic model blenders. They both have similar sounding features and the same motor and watt size, but the Classic was less expensive. Tuesday Morning had both of these blender models for the same price, but the Classic came with an extra smaller size carafe&hellip; which of course I wanted. So I bought them both to compare and I am so glad I did.The Diamond is definitely of higher quality. The carafe on the Diamond locks into place and fits securely, not so with the Classic. I did an experiment making fruit smoothies, same ingredients for each. While blending on the highest setting with the Classic I felt like I had to put my hand on the lid to steady the machine, and when I did it was quieter and more steady. When I placed my hand on the Diamond to do the same thing, there was no change in sound or steadiness. The lid on the Classic almost felt like it was the wrong one, it was difficult to put in place and difficult to remove. The Diamond lid fits like you would expect, no issues.They both blended the smoothie exactly the same, so no difference in performance.The Classic base (red) is surprisingly large. The Diamond (grey) is smaller and more refined looking. They both have pulse and crush, and 5 speeds but I prefer the controls on the Diamond.So the Classic, despite the cool 2nd carafe, is going back and we are keeping the Diamond</p>

<h5 id="if-you-think-you-want-a-vitamix-check-out-the-kitchenaid-first">If you think you want a Vitamix, check out the KitchenAid first!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am SO glad I did enough research to decide on this blender! I was leaning heavily toward the Breville or the more expensive Vitamix but I found a video review that did a very honest comparison of 5 blenders including KitchenAid, Breville, Hamilton Beach Professional, Blendtec, and Vitamix and the KitchenAid outperformed them all. The pitcher is plastic but it is so substantial I don&rsquo;t feel this is in any way cheap and the 60 ounce capacity is really great. I do smoothies almost every day and I am just amazed to find out how unnecessarily hard I had been working. What literally took me 5 minutes to do is now done in about 30 seconds and I don&rsquo;t have to turn the blender off and move things around and my smoothies are very thick with minimal added liquid. Cleanup is easy since I just rinse it out and then fill halfway with warm water and a couple of drops of dishwashing liquid and cycle the blender for 10 seconds or so and rinse it out and dry it and I&rsquo;m done. There are no cracks around the buttons for dirt or splash to get into, so the metal base is super easy to keep clean. When I first put the lid on the pitcher I thought it was a very loose fit, but then I figured out there is a technique to putting the lid on. I put the lid on touching the pour spout area first and then lower the rear of the lid and it fits snug. One of the things I noticed on some other blenders was difficulty in taking off the lid. This blender doesn&rsquo;t struggle with anything and doesn&rsquo;t make me struggle either. Seriously, if you are considering buying a KitchenAid I can&rsquo;t imagine you would be less than thrilled with its performance. Watch the popularmechanics video review and you will see what swayed me.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-blender-for-nutritional-shake-for-elderly">Perfect Blender for Nutritional Shake for Elderly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This blender was purchased to make my elderly father-in-law health shakes/smoothies. Since he has a milk intolerance, I wasn&rsquo;t able to give him some of the prepared products. Years ago I used a blender for making baby food but that blender wasn&rsquo;t mixing the ingredients easily and was hard to clean. My husband did the research and this one seemed to cover all the bases.Now his afternoon snack is a shake/smoothy made of frozen bananas, apples (I throw in the whole thing except the stem), almond milk, and a scoop of nutritional powder. On the liquify setting, the result is like a thick shake. I always suggest he savor, but he drinks it down in 30 seconds or less and always comments how good it was.The design makes cleaning very easy but I stick it in the dishwasher anyway. My husband&rsquo;s research paid off. I can&rsquo;t imagine any blending need that this blender would not accomplish without a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-nice-incremental-improvement">A nice incremental improvement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was surprised by how good this blender was. I have the previous version, which I really like, and really tried hard to find again (but it&rsquo;s now more expensive since they don&rsquo;t make it anymore.)The good: The pitcher locks on to the base (the previous version just sat on top thanks to gravity). The top fits in more snuggly / securely than the previous version. Like the previous version, it&rsquo;s easy to clean by wiping down with a rag (the control buttons are all sealed, like the previous version).I still have the old one (different location), and it&rsquo;s still working great. The new one works pretty much the same way, and I like it.For what it&rsquo;s worth: Assembled in the USA. No idea if that means that they just put it in the box in the USA, or if they actually do some building of the product here, or what.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-a-normal-blender">Good for a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; blender</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great &ldquo;normal&rdquo; blender. I had a very cheap Wal-Mart blender, and I didn&rsquo;t like it because when I make very thick smoothies, an air pocket forms at the bottom around the blades so that nothing gets mixed up. This can be solved by melting the ice a bit using hot water, or just wait.This blender is much nicer, but has the same problem. One thing that is different from this to the cheaper varieties is that this one knows how fast it is going. When the air pocket happens, the blender, noticing that it doesn&rsquo;t have a load, slows down so that it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a rocket engine taking off.I returned this one and bought a ninja because it has three pairs of blades. With that arrangement, it is impossible for an air pocket to form at the bottom because the upper blades will stir the contents up notwithstanding. I make smoothies now that won&rsquo;t even pour from the blender!!</p>
