<h5 id="fantastic-so-far-took-me-my-surprise">Fantastic so far&hellip;. Took me my surprise !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have time read this review, I think it will help you decide to buy or not. First, I dislike earbuds and find them annoying because they never stayed in my ears. So after going through 3 sets of headphones in one year and damaging them due to sweat and having to clean the headphone pads to avoid them from stinking of dry sweat, I broke down and searched for a pair of earbud style with a clip around the ear to help keep them in place better. Like most of us, I searched for them here on Amazon. There were three things I looked for: one is the reviews, second is that it&rsquo;s fulfilled by Amazon ( so I have some backing if these things are bad ) and third is warranty period for them. Paying $125 to $200 was not what I wanted to spend on name brands that don&rsquo;t deliver and are hyped up for their name, that&rsquo;s just me ! I figured I take a chance on these earbuds for $34.00, and must say I was pleasantly surprised by their performance and quality so far. The sound coming out of these earbuds is just incredible to me. At the gym, I have them paired with my iPhone 5S and at 50% they are loud as hell. I will probably never need to go higher than that . Connection with my iPhone was easy and no issues. The fact that they are sweatproof was a must for me. The 30 ft distance in my home worked fine through 2 walls to the other end of my home. I made calls with them and the mic worked well. I tested the running time of 8 hrs, and it was on point with what they said . The comfort wearing them to my ears was great and guess what they stay in place. The clip around the ear is a soft rubber or silicone material that surprisingly works to help keep the earbuds in my ear. Then you get other little gifts like hard carry case, dual car charger, a short charge cable and 3 foot charge cable that works for as a lightning cable and mirco usb cable&hellip;.. Both will charge the earbuds. Also you get two sets of ear tips small and large and the earbuds have a mid size on them already. My Amazon friends things are mass produced and during production you will have like in any other product defective units that leave the factory, but remember you have a one year warranty and I&rsquo;m sure that they will back it up or Amazon will. All I can say is that after a full week I am very pleased with my purchase and guess what I did, I bought a second pair&hellip;.the gray ones&hellip;.lol ! The only cons I have at the time of this review is that they charge you more for the gray ones, than the red ones, and the earbud pads are little in different in feel from the gray and red earbuds, but in no way is it a deal breaker. At their price point and with what you get these are a very good deal, especially from a unknown brand. I can only see with time how they do, but for now these earbuds rock. I have a one year warranty on them so I&rsquo;m not worried. Wish you all good luck.</p>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-it">I absolutely love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love it!!!!! The sound is amazing, it&rsquo;s light and easy to use. The only thing is after about 6-7 hours of use STRAIGHT, it&rsquo;ll start to feel a LITTLE uncomfortable in your ear. To sum it up, it is worth every penny!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what">What?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I paid $200 for beats. These are almost exactly the same as Beats minus the price.They come with a nice headphone and iPhone combo car charger.Sounds just like my beats. Good bass and very loud.Invest in these especially if you travel a lot and don&rsquo;t want to lose your expensive headphones.Edit: one big gripe after having them for a month. It can take 15-30 seconds for my iPhone to find the headphones if I&rsquo;m turning on my Bluetooth. It&rsquo;s even a bigger pain in the you know what if I have to switch from one Bluetooth device (like a car Bluetooth) to my headphones. It may be a minor issue but it&rsquo;s an everyday issue.Also the ear loops are loosey goosey. They aren&rsquo;t very suitable for running or any other high intensity activity.</p>

<h5 id="great-pair-of-headphones-packed-with-a-lot-of-accessories">Great pair of headphones packed with a lot of accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great. Sound quality is really good. I love bass and one of the factors for me when I buy a pair of headphone is if you can hear the bass or feel it. You can definitely hear and feel the bass a little. I literally got these therefore I&rsquo;ll do an updated review later when I test battery life etc. I work midnights and with the movements etc. of what I do when I work. I am confident that these will last a long time. So far a definently buy if your looking for headphones. I&rsquo;ll update this review tomorrow. If anything crazy happens with the headphones you&rsquo;ll know.UPDATE.These headphones are great. They last a long time. I have yet to run out of battery. They also don&rsquo;t take too long to charge 1 hours and your ready to go. They are durable and stays in your ear. Which is also a plus. My only complaint is the material that goes around your ear but that&rsquo;s personal preference. I also love the fact that on iPhone. Idk about anywhere else. But on iPhone it shows the battery percentage. (Look st picture.) 5 STARS 5 STARS 5 STARS!</p>

<h5 id="i-consider-myself-and-audiophile-so-here-is-a-true-review">I consider myself and audiophile so here is a true review.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using these to workout and didn&rsquo;t want to spend a ton. These headphones are good (not great) and need to be tweeked to sound good. They have way to much bass and low vocals. That line is directed right to the company in what they need to fix. The good news is as long as your phone/music device can adjust sounds like my iPhone 6 can you are in luck. For the IPhone choose bass reducer and you will breathe a sigh of relief. For other devices you will need to find out or research how to do this. Haven&rsquo;t had them on long, but had to fix it asap! Hope this works for whoever reads and the company notes this as well!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have yet to find a pair of ear buds that got right especially when exercising UNTIL NOW!!!Yesterday I ran my first 5k wearing these WITH sunglasses and they were super comfortable and did not fall out. I have already recommended these to a couple friends. The sound is so good too. It drowns out everything around you. The controls are easy to use on the move, changing tracks or adjusting volume. And pairing these to a phone is idiot proof. 5 starts all around. Well done!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-work-great">They work great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my new headphones. I work as a AArrow Sign Spinner. I am very active and my new headphones didn&rsquo;t fall out once plus they lasted my entire 6 hour shift. The photo I provided I am wearing them and I am completely pleased as punch!</p>
