<ul>
<li>Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) system - The Syma X8C has the Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) function. Usually, the forward direction of a flying multi-rotor is the same as the nose direction. By using IOC, the forward direction has nothing to do with nose direction. This lessens the steepness of the learning curve and allows the pilot to enjoy flight while slowly learning each specific orientation of the quadcopter.</li>
<li>6 AXIS GYRO - Equipped with the latest 6-axis flight control systems, 3D lock, More scheduled flight, operating more to the force!</li>
<li>2MP HD Camera - Built-in the quadcopter for you to take photos and videos while flying! Have photos from aerial viewpoints while flying the quadcopter!</li>
<li>Colorful flashing lights - have fun playing with it during the day or nights with your friends, family, kids, even pets!</li>

<li><p>Blade Protector - comes with blade protectors to protect your blades in flight or from wear or minor crashes!</p>

<h5 id="best-beginner-level-quadcopter-for-videography-on-the-market">Best Beginner-Level Quadcopter For Videography On The Market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;HopptaCopter&rdquo; is what my wife calls my new Syma X8C quadcopter after watching me ascend and descend the pilot’s learning curve. Do I recommend the X8C. Heck yes! It&rsquo;s a gas to fly for inexperienced pilots!It has many advantages over the most recent incarnation of the DJI Phantom or similar high-end quadcopters capable of airborne videography. Top among them is COST! Will it do what the Phantom will do? Not even close&ndash;no GPS, no gimbals to stabilize video, no flight planning, no long endurance, no brushless motors, and certainly no quality camera. But, if you are new to quadcopters (and, that is an important caveat), the X8C is a great vehicle to start with and enjoy until you are ready to graduate to a machine costing much more.Did I mention cost? For under $100 you get an extremely durable quadcopter with fight characteristics in terms of payload and handling similar to much more expensive quadcopters. My intent from the beginning was to invest in the Syma X8C to determine whether or not I could fly a quadcopter and, more importantly, enjoy a REAL quadcopter. Could I have done the same thing for less money with the Syma X5C-1 or similar vehicles at a lower price point? Sure. But, they are not in the same class in terms of payload, range, and capabilities as the higher-end vehicles I thought I might enjoy later. I wanted something that would not only be affordable as a proof of concept, but also not break the bank to maintain or modify while I decided whether or not I would graduate to a pro-sumer level quadcopter for videography.Low initial cost is one significant advantage and associated with it is low cost to maintain. For a few dollars, I can replace any part of the X8C—props, prop guards, landing legs, motors, batteries, etc. Used the way I suggest—a learning platform—you will be replacing components almost immediately. I learned early the prop guards are essential for indoor and outdoor flights. Stock up! I have replaced one or more guards after almost every flight. Otherwise, this quadcopter hangs together well. I have crashed from various altitudes up to 20 or 30 feet and the X8C survived the beating without major repair.Add to low cost of maintenance, low cost to modify. The camera provided with the X8C is a throw-away. This should be no surprise to anyone who has researched the X8C on YouTube. I have never used my Syma camera, but the mounting bracket came in handy. When I was ready to add a camera to the learning curve, I purchased a Xiaomi Yi action camera for about the same cost as the X8C. Mounting this camera required several other modifications. But, with so little invested in the quadcopter and camera (well under $200), I was not uncomfortable about modifying my X8C. The next modification (thank you Santa) will be a gimbal to stabilize video. After adding a third-party gimbal, I will have approximately $250 invested in a quadcopter that is durable enough to use as I became a competent pilot and capable of basic videography.Bottom line: the Syma X8C is an affordable way to enter the quadcopter videography game. Additionally, it is durable for the inexperienced pilot. And, it can be cheaply repaired or modified as your skill level increases without growing ulcers in the process. Oh, did I mention it is a lot of fun to fly!</p>

<h5 id="the-best-way-to-spend-48">The best way to spend $48!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me first start by saying that I am a Phantom 3 owner. There are some similarities (size, forward acceleration in rate 2 but certainly not speed, and some GENERAL flight characteristics) but not many.That being said, comparing those 2 quads is apples to oranges. I love this quad!I bought this for 2 reasons, first, I wanted something more &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; for aerial shots that may be too risky for me to risk losing a $500 quad. The second is, I wanted something similar in size to help me learn how to fly my phantom more efficiently and smoothly. I can honestly say that this is the best way to spend $50 in this hobby. It is completely worth it, I&rsquo;ve even considered buying a second just to have on hand. As an added note the flight time is much longer than 7 minutes, it more like 10+.I will be doing a YouTube review on this quad in the next month or so along with a camera upgrade and anti jello mount. Be sure to keep an eye out for it on my channel: Average Guy ReviewsAs for the camera I didn&rsquo;t find it to be as bad as others have claimed. The jello was definitely there, but it was minimal comparably speaking. This is my 5th camera quad (excluding the Phantom 3) and it has solid video quality when compared to other toy grade quads.knowing what I know now I would have bought extra batteries as it takes a lifetime to charge (roughly 3 hours).Overall though 5 solid stars! This quad exceed my expectations and shipping was quick and on time (thank you seller! You will definitely be seeing return business from me).</p>

<h5 id="love-the-quad">Love the quad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the quad! my only complaint is the stock battery that came with it does not seem to last more than 1 minute on full charge. im not sure if they all have this issue but i contacted the customer service rep. and they sent me a new battery in replace of the faulty one. hopefully this fixes the issue. great purchase overall!</p>

<h5 id="not-a-good-first-drone-but-ok-for-experienced-drone-operators">Not a good first drone but OK for experienced drone operators</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not as stable in flight as another drone (Promark VR) that I have of the same size and weight. There must be difference in how the 6-axis gyro is interfaced to the control system. Power consumption is higher, so even though it uses the exact same battery, it runs about half the length of time per charge. This is likely due to the lower cost/louder motors used. If I did not have the Promark first, I probably would not have known the difference. Light breezes affect it more. The control range is less, but that is described if you read the specifications before buying. I do not recommend this as a first drone, it would be easy to lose control if you don&rsquo;t have experience. For experianced operators, it performs well. I chose it because I wanted to get more flight time in with a drone of the same size, weight, and look as my Promark without risking it. Where I live (heavy forest) there are many trees and there is at least a light breeze most of the time. I use my Promark to check my property for live video observation of intruders when my perimeter motion detectors go off. By putting in more flights, it discourages intruders. They can hear the Syma X8C Venture much further away, so when do I operate the Promark, it is more stealthy.</p>

<h5 id="spend-a-little-extra-for-a-better-drone">Spend a little extra for a better drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun to fly&hellip;.when you can control it. Loses orientation very easily, and when battery is low or drone goes too far, it stops responding to the remote commands. I was flying and It refused to listen to my commands telling it to turn or fly forward/back, yet continued to climb into the air. It got caught in the wind, and that was the last I saw of it as it flew away into the horizon. It&rsquo;s not a bad drone for beginners, as it&rsquo;s cheap and definitely can fly, but you&rsquo;re much better off paying a little extra and buying a drone with better system controls. This one will just frustrate you and eventually break/get lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-trainer-model">Excellent Trainer Model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would recommend this drone as a trainer especially if you plan to invest in a high end drone. It can stand some pretty hard crash landings without major damage but it&rsquo;s range&hellip;</p>
