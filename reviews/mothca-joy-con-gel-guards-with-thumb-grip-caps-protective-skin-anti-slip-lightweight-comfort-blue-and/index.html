<h5 id="i-am-very-pleased-with-these-gel-guards">I am very pleased with these gel guards</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with these gel guards.They have a good fit, not to tight yet not loose. They are very smooth to your touch and in this past week of use I haven&rsquo;t felt any issues with them slipping from my grasp in any way.That takes me to the next point I haven&rsquo;t had any difficulty with pressing any of the buttons as I&rsquo;ve seen other reviews mention that they&rsquo;ve had to cut out areas around the buttons.Visually the colors are nice and vibrant, it doesn&rsquo;t have any discoloration or faded out hue and to some one with grey joy-cons like myself I feel it adds a nice touch to the switch. They don&rsquo;t have any bad odors either.All in all I like them a lot as they works both for protection and as a cosmetic upgrade.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-accessory-to-have-for-the-joycons-to-make-long-gametime-more-comfortable">Good Accessory To Have For The Joycons To Make Long Gametime More Comfortable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When you have medium to big hands prolonged gaming with the joycons can get a little uncomfortable as the joycons put pressure in the middle of your hands which make keeping them in your grip a little tedious as you want to open them up a little and give your hands a rest. These grips really help out with that situation as they make holding the joycons more comfortable when playing a game for a few hours without the discomfort you had before. The silicon rubberized grip fits snugly onto the joycon without any fear of tearing or moving about when gaming the thumbstick covers are decent to but I&rsquo;m a kontrolfreek thumbsgrip fan and prefer theirs over most others though again that&rsquo;s not to say these thumgrips are bad far from it.This is another accessory for the Switch I feel is definitely worth getting along with the protector case and screen protector to insure your Switch has a long life without any hassles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-comfortable-product-for-the-money">Good, comfortable product for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:- If you can get them around $8 or less they are great- Much more comfortable for larger hands on the switch with the contoured back- Thumb grips are very comfortable, much prefer them to the default sticks- Can detach and attach the joycons without having to remove the silicone grips- Easy to mod to your preferenceCons:- New out of package, they make pressing some face buttons harder than normal. May require light modding.- Slight plastic/silicone smell brand new out of package, will probably go away with time.Overall these are great, assuming you can get them around $8. And I say that because they do require some slight cutting if you want to make them really nice. After playing a circuit in Fast RMX, I immediately found it hard to feel if you were pressing the phase button (X) while holding down accelerate (A). I decided to cut away both the cross segments between the YXBA buttons and the UDLR cross buttons. Upon doing so and seeing that it was an immediate improvement, I cut additional paths out the the home and screenshot buttons. Everything is accessible now and they work great, took maybe a minute to fix. You could probably cut out additional paths to + and - buttons as well but since those don&rsquo;t get pressed quite as much I didn&rsquo;t see that necessary.So again really nice inexpensive product if you feel comfortable enough with an exacto to make them perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="color-swap">Color swap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Grips are made out good material. The colors were swapped from my joy-cons, red grip is right hand and blue grip (slightly darker than joy-con) is left hand. I personally do like how they look though. I also love the additional grip on the back. It makes the switch a lot more comfortable when playing in handheld mode. The only con I find is that the grip itself is pretty thick so it makes the buttons level with the grip and you have to push a little harder on the buttons. I read another review and he took a knife and cut out the area where the buttons are. Might try that&hellip; (excuse my fingerprints on the screen in the pictures! 😊)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-little-gel-sleeves-especially-for-big-hands">Excellent little gel sleeves - especially for big hands&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;which I have, and let me tell you&hellip;the hand-cramps are real after playing an hour of BotW due to the tiny joy cons.These gel sleeves aid in reducing said hand-cramps without adding a whole lot of bulk to the device. There is just enough material added to allow a firmer, more complete grip without adding bulk to the device. They slip on easily and all the cutouts are as they should be and where they should be. I haven&rsquo;t tried any other sleeves so I can&rsquo;t compare them to anything, but I am glad I went with these.Also, I purchased the Mothca carrying case (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBB4K89/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1?th=1">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBB4K89/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1?th=1</a>) and with these sleeves installed, the Switch still fits, albeit a bit tighter than I think it should be. However, I doubt it&rsquo;ll cause any issues.</p>

<h5 id="wish-it-came-with-different-height-thumb-grips">Wish it came with different height thumb grips.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set is an improvement on a naked switch but will still leave you wanting a pro controller. The colors are spot on which I was worried about when I ordered since I do have the blue and red joycons. I haven&rsquo;t had any trouble hitting buttons but I do wish the thumb grips were taller. I got this because my hands were cramping up playing splatoon with a naked switch and this is better, no twitching but still tightness in the left hand. The black sleeves slip on and off easily enough when you want to slip the joycons into a plastic grip.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="while-they-look-and-feel-nice-i-immediately-had-an-issue-with-how-it">While they look and feel nice, I immediately had an issue with how it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While they look and feel nice, I immediately had an issue with how it made pushing the buttons feel. Pushing the &ldquo;-&rdquo; button on the left Joy-Con was particularly a chore.I ended up cutting away the middle parts of the d-pad/ABXY buttons, and started to cut around the +/- buttons before deciding it was too much work for what it was worth. If they had made the gel guards less tight around the buttons, it would have made them a lot easier to push.I ended up tossing the Joy-Con covers out, but I still use the thumb grips for a pop of color on my pair of gray Joy-Cons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-right-for-the-price-of-8">Just right for the price of $8</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These fit the joy cons really nicely. The red one is not really the same color as shown, it&rsquo;s a little more orange but still looks nice. It&rsquo;s a little hard to press the plus and minus buttons with them on, but that&rsquo;s not surprising for any kind of skin I guess , For eight dollars this was a great purchase!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These grips make handling the switch so much better. And with the bright neon color scheme, I feel less bad that I got the grey joycons now lol</p>

<h5 id="wish-they-were-slightly-bigger">Wish they were slightly bigger&hellip;</h5>

<p>Overall a good product, the only downside that I&rsquo;ve seen aside from everything else everyone else has posted is that I wish the &ldquo;grip&rdquo; portion was a bit bigger, I have&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great grips, makes it easier on the hands when playing games and fit nicely and is very comfortable.</p>

<p>The little round bottom covers keep coming off.</p>

<h5 id="wasn-t-what-i-was-looking-for">Wasn&rsquo;t what I was looking for&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The analog caps fit nice and snug and the grip is perfect for when you use the joycons as your main controller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thumb-sticks-gel-pads-are-the-only-good-thing-though">thumb sticks gel pads are the only good thing though</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Silicon slides off joycons and is not properly cut, thumb sticks gel pads are the only good thing though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very comfortable and soft. they fit very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good">Pretty good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very comfortable, and I feel the buttons fit well. HOWEVER, I do feel that the -/+ buttons become a little bit more difficult to reach and press because the cover goes over them&hellip;</p>
