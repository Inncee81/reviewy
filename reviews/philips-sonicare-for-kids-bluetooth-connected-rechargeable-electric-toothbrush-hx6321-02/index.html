<h5 id="for-kids-under-five-order-the-smaller-hx6032-heads">For kids under five, order the smaller HX6032 heads.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For kids under 5, I recommend you order the smaller heads, HX6032 is the part number. You can save the head that comes with this brush for when they are more accustomed to the large size of the Sonicate Kids brush handle and original head. For my 4 year old, the original head was just too big.</p>

<h5 id="very-effective-be-careful-with-the-pressure">Very effective. Be careful with the pressure.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this toothbrush for my 4-year old daughter, because we were having trouble keeping her teeth, well, clean. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but suddenly her teeth started looking really stained all the time.Once we started using this toothbrush, we saw an improvement almost immediately. Her teeth looked shiny and clean. I didn&rsquo;t know if she was going to freak out about the vibration, but she was fine with it. And I love that Sonicare adds the little musical alerts when you are supposed to switch sides. She still laughs a bit when that alert sounds.The main reason I wanted to write a review for this toothbrush, though, is this. In the question and answer section on the product page here, someone mentioned that it&rsquo;s important for a parent to help kids brush with this toothbrush, since it is possible to cause serious gum damage with the brush if you aren&rsquo;t careful. I wish someone had told ME that before I started using my Sonicare brush a few years ago. After unintentionally pressing too hard while using this brush, I have serious gum recession&ndash;to the point that I&rsquo;ve had several dentists tell me that I&rsquo;ll probably need to get a tissue transplant in one area. (Ugh, not looking forward to that&hellip;)The point is that, apparently, you are supposed to hold this brush with only three fingers while brushing&ndash;that&rsquo;s how little pressure you are supposed to put on your teeth/gums. If your kid is too young to know how much (or how little) pressure to put on her gums while brushing, you are probably going to want to help her.All in all, we really love this brush. It has made a huge difference in my daughter&rsquo;s smile. Plus, Amazon has the brush at such a great price, it is definitely worth a try.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-the-app-that-makes-brushing-fun">It is the app that makes brushing fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We came back from the dentist with a not-so-good report. Our dentist recommended an electric toothbrush. We tried the standard electric toothbrushes before, but the kids would do a quick brush over and be done.When we purchased this toothbrush, we were experiencing the same issue as before. Sure the stickers were nice, but it didn&rsquo;t help with the brushing. We decided to try the free app that comes along with the toothbrush (you&rsquo;ll need bluetooth on your device). When running the app, you&rsquo;ll see a pic of a cartoon&rsquo;s mouth. The goal is to clean the entire mouth. The toothbrush seen on the device (we use both ipad and samsung tablet), mirrors the kids&rsquo; toothbrush. All of the teeth start dirty and will only be cleaned once your child brushes that area. What a difference!! Not only are the kids brushing their teeth, but they are cleaning all of their teeth. This is much better than the red dye pill we used to take as a kid.I have recommended the same toothbrush to both my sisters for their children.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-worth-every-penny">Absolutely worth every penny!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These have worked great! The kids love brushing their teeth! No arguments!!!!! No delays!!! You remind them and they hurry to brush teeth to see the reward they get in the app!!! The tooth brush should have 5 stars but I gave it a 4 because the app that it associates with sometimes drops the connection to the tooth brush. You end up having to reconnect the Bluetooth to the device. But otherwise no other issue. I would recommend this to anyone with kids even if they do a great job brushing. They will enjoy it even more!!!!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="incredible-and-international">Incredible and International!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only downside to this is the brushhead size looks like it&rsquo;s for an adult, not a child&rsquo;s mouth. (Or my child has a freakishly small mouth). Otherwise, inbetween the app and this brush has made my 4 year old now ASK to brush her teeth so she can play w/ her sparkly. The other cool aspect is that the app has several language packs. One of which is 日本語(Japanese). Very helpful for our household where we try to keep everything Japanese for immersion.</p>

<h5 id="my-kids-to-brush-now">My kids ♥️ To brush now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids are crazy about brushing their teeth since we got these new tooth brushes. They are she&rsquo;s 3 &amp; 5.I did read another review &amp; ordered the smaller kids brushes to use for my 3yr old and it works great.The brushes have a low &amp; high speed. They even come with fun stickers so the kids can decorate their brush.The best part is the App that syncs with the toothbrush via Bluetooth. It&rsquo;s a very fun interactive way to make them enjoy brushing.Each morning &amp; night they brush along with the app and then see what rewards on the app they get.I can easily see how older kids would think the app is stupid. It is really geared towards younger kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="need-a-kid-to-brush-longer-get-this">Need a kid to brush longer? Get this&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this for my son because the dentist recommended it. The primary recommendation was because of the timer. They said he probably wasn&rsquo;t brushing long enough and that something like this would alleviate that problem. It&rsquo;s got 4 sequences that it will cycle through for 2 minutes (30 sec/sequence). He really likes it, but it took A LOT of adjustment for him. It&rsquo;s pretty powerful, so get ready to have toothpaste everywhere, initially at least. Even though the head is small, he still had trouble at first brushing his back teeth. This is because you feel like you need to keep your mouth closed or risk making a huge mess. He&rsquo;s doing better now, but still is adjusting.He really likes the timed feature. He just goes for the 2 minutes and he&rsquo;s done. Overall, the adjustment has been a bigger issue than I expected, but it&rsquo;s doing what it was purchased for, getting our son to brush longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-except-for-brush-head-size">Great, except for brush head size&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything I expected from a Sonicare toothbrush. I like the dual speed option for children just getting used to an oscillating brush.</p>
