<h5 id="a-great-stand">A great stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Tecboss Phone/Tablet stand is a pretty heavy duty solid metal stand. it will hold your phone or tablet securely.I had my tablet on it with the rather thick cover still on and the stand held it.The stand can be adjusted up or down to whatever position you prefer. It has pads on the bottom to prevent it from scratching the surface that you place it on and also to prevent it from sliding.Because this stand folds up completely, it is small enough to fit in your purse and therefore is easy to transport wherever you need it.The movement is smooth yet quite firm so it should not move out of the position that you set it in.I got this for when we go camping, we have a small camper and do not have a TV in it. I can place this stand on the table and when it is raining outside, we can watch a show or movie inside where it is nice and dry.I am very pleased with this Tecboss stand</p>

<h5 id="switch-is-now-comfortable-for-big-hands">Switch is now comfortable for big hands.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>note, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s not quite 5 stars, but it&rsquo;s closer to 5 than 4, like a <sup>92</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>, so lets review:This makes the switch usable for long playsessions, especially for those with large hands, from the start of the wrist to the top of the middle finger, my hands are a bit over 9 inches long. this makes gripping the switch a bit cumbersome at times. having the grip-shaped &ldquo;lumps&rdquo; on the back of each joy-con makes it much easier to hold and adds more comfort during long play sessions.some people may not like the following:the texture is very smooth silicon. it gets fibers, particularly pet hair stuck to it with ease. dirt/grime hasnt been a problem as long as you keep your hands clean and dont just put it down or drop it in sand/dirt. the one time I got some dirt on it by accident, washing it with room temp water then drying it thoroughly fixed it right up.You need to remove it to remove the joy-cons. this is always going to be a small inconvience, admittedly it would have been better to design this as a 3-part case, with the middle being a hard shell with a cover flap that doubles as a kickstand. but that would add cost and raise the price, maybe a good idea would be for someone like tecboss to introduce some joy-con covers that have the lump built into them. I haven&rsquo;t found any like this on amazon yet, only full-covering silicon cases with the grip lumps (like this one).the fit is a bit loose, but its not a problem during play at all. the silicon has never covered any buttons or prevented me from doing what I want in any games. it does sag a bit in the middle, but this is simply unavoidable if you want to be able to remove and replace the case on the switch with ease.the only things I think could improve the product are nitpicks that would raise the cost or introduce complexity that would increase failure rates. as a simple silicon cover, its perfect for what it is and can be.</p>

<h5 id="how-is-something-so-simple-so-awesome-i-am-using-this-for-the-switch">How is something so simple so awesome. I am using this for the switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How is something so simple so awesome. I am using this for the switch, and it works great. As others have stated the lower vents do get partially obstructed but it&rsquo;s not horrible.I was skeptic when I first ordered this &ldquo;how can something so simple possibly work as well as people are claiming. Well let me tell you. The item is solid aluminum and has some decent weight to it. There is a decent amount of rubber around the device slot so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it scratching your device. The hinges are good quality and don&rsquo;t sag at all. And last but not least it folds flat so it isn&rsquo;t a huge space waster.All in all this is a must have for table top switch gaming.</p>

<h5 id="fits-the-nintendo-switch-as-advertised">Fits the Nintendo Switch as advertised.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought another stand with a solitary base that was too thin and the arms weren&rsquo;t at all covered so your tablet was sitting on the sharp aluminum edges, not great. One thing to note, is that this seems to be one of those Amazon items that every seller buys and slaps their name on, and as such, one can assume they&rsquo;re all the same item, just different prices. This was one of the most inexpensive one I found on Amazon, I think there was a $13.xx one, either way, they&rsquo;re most likely all the same product. So go with the least expensive one.Pros:-It fits the Nintendo Switch (NS) without a skin. With a silicon skin on, it&rsquo;s a bit hard to get it to fit. Luckily the arm stops a millimeter or so before the bend and the bend is all silicon, no metal behind it, so it will bend outwards to accommodate the silicon cover on my Nintendo Switch-Love that the usable area is completely covered in a silicon sleeve to ensure that it won&rsquo;t scratch your tablet, since the metal under it isn&rsquo;t chamfered or softened at all.-The feet on this don&rsquo;t look great, but are rather grippy and don&rsquo;t move around a lot.-The hole in the back of the arm is nice and large, and as such means you can easily snake a charging cable through with enough clearance for longer cable ends like those on the Nintendo Switch Official Charger&rsquo;s USB C end.-Hefty, this has a good bit of weight to it. Combine that with the huge amount of positions you can manipulate this stand to, you can adjust its center of gravity to make it more secure and comfortable for you.-Great tension on the arms, not so tight that it&rsquo;s hard to manipulate, but far from loose that it would feel like it would randomly collapse on you.Cons:- The paint isn&rsquo;t as silky as I would think, it&rsquo;s a rough matte texture.- The metal edges are still rather sharp- No carrying pouch for it. Hold on to the box for it, it&rsquo;s a nice and compact little box that will help prevent the stand from scratching your other items in your bag.In the end, I say get it, holds the Switch, can hold other things, 4 dollars cheaper than similar looking stands. I like it a lot and is a lot cheaper than the Official Nintendo Hori stand, with a whole lot more positions to adjust your tablet in. I think this option is 10 dollars cheaper than Nintendo&rsquo;s.</p>
