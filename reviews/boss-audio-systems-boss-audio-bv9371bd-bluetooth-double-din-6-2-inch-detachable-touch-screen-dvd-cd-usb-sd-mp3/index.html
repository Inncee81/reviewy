<h5 id="very-satisfied">Very Satisfied!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The installation was as easy as could be. My brother helped me get it to fit just right. Love it, I wouldn&rsquo;t haven&rsquo;t picked another one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worst-radio-ive-ever-bought">Worst radio ive ever bought!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This receiver started out as a great product. Every thing worked as it was designed to. Audio quality was ok, screen resolution was pretty good. In a matter of weeks the radio started doing weird things. First the screen started to change to different colors. I would turn it on and the whole screen would be shaded blue. Restart the unit and It would be back to normal. Then the touch screen would randomly stop recognizing. Same thing, restart and it would be to normal. Then the touch screen would just stop working. Except this time restarting it would do nothing. Decided to take it apart to figure out what was wrong but couldn&rsquo;t find anything.So now this radio just sits in my garage. I would not recommend this to anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was not as good as I hoped. Had to buy a signal booster because the reception with this radio was not as good as the stock radio I took out. Even though it was the same antenna. One of the features I wanted was the being able to use my steering wheel controls. Unfortunately I have to continually reset the controls because the radio loses the settings. It turned into such a nuisance that I don&rsquo;t even use the steering wheel controls anymore. Just because it says that it will fit in your dash, make sure your check for additional items, i.e. Mounting kit, electrical connectors, they are not included. The other features worked. I purchased the additional mic to use my phone, it works well. Bluetooth works as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="crappie-junk">Crappie JUNK!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I installed the unit with all connections soldered. It worked great for two weeks with no issues. The camera was also installed with soldered connections and worked great for two weeks. Unfortunately now when I start my truck the unit will power up but will not play. You can&rsquo;t even change radio stations. I have learned with the remote I can power it off and back on then it works. So after all the pain and money of installing it properly I have a piece of junk</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-replacement-stereo-for-a-2000-toyota-celica">Great replacement stereo for a 2000 Toyota Celica</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this originally for my wife&rsquo;s din <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> Dodge truck. We decided to wait to install until we bought the new bezel for a double din, but I came across a 2000 Toyota Celica as a commuter and decided to install it in the Celica as it already had a double din radio. You have to get a kit that has two trim pieces (Scosche 2000-up Scion/Toyota DBL DIN Kit, TA1465B) that fit in slots on the regular mounting brackets as this radio is a bit slimmer on the sides than the stock radio. I used all the original brackets for the new radio, and a Metra Toyota wiring harness (All the color coded wires do match). All in all, it took me about an hour to wire everything and fit it in place. I kind of marred the dash a bit because my screwdriver wasn&rsquo;t cooperating when popping clips, but all in all, it works great. It takes some getting used to, and make sure you run your brake wire to the ground wire so you can run the DVD player while rolling. It&rsquo;s pretty basic as far as touch screens go these days, but it does the trick. Bluetooth phone worked fine, and it has USB and other hookups for pretty much any media device. I&rsquo;d recommend if you&rsquo;re looking for something a bit more advanced than a stock radio, yet not breaking the budget.</p>

<h5 id="powerful-and-reliable">Powerful and reliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have this stereo in my everyday driver I am very pleased with it. After several months of regular use I have found no problems at all, does everything it says, good picture. Has a great sound it is very powerful. Cons Not the most feature rich touchscreen stereo but its got enough to be a great quality product. the touch screen can be over sensitive but I have Large hands and fingers.</p>
