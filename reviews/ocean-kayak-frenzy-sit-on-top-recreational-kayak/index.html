<blockquote>
<p>As a new floridian, I wanted a kayak. Did my Amazon research to pick out the best. I had never been on a kayak. Chose the Ocean Kayak Frenzy based on reviews. A few days after they arrived, we took them out on our Lagoon. Paddled around for a bit, it was fun, and put them up.Cut to a few weeks later when hurricane Hermine came a knocking. She made landfall late September 1st early September 2. Water started entering the house and didn&rsquo;t stop. We escaped out of the house on the kayaks with a dog each.Bottom line-If I can safely paddle in the pitch black thru a hurricane with a forty pound dog who is 100% sure the worst place to be is on a kayak, and not tip over and not get swept away my second time being on a kayak? Then I made a damn good choice in said kayak purchase.Thank you Ocean Kayak.</p>

<h5 id="so-happy-with-my-choice">So happy with my choice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After much research &amp; deliberation, I settled on the frenzy &amp; I have no regrets. I needed something small enough that I could handle loading &amp; unloading it from my car by myself, but also wanted a good sturdy sit on top.I was slightly concerned by some reviewers saying the seat is narrow &amp; uncomfortable for larger folk during longer paddles. I&rsquo;m a solid size 12-14 female &amp; I think there&rsquo;s plenty of room. It&rsquo;s snug, but not the least bit tight or uncomfortable. I don&rsquo;t think I would want any more room to wiggle around. I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;5&rdquo; &amp; there&rsquo;s plenty of room to stretch out. The storage areas in front &amp; back can hold all kinds of stuff. The only bummer is my dog doesn&rsquo;t really fit with me. She&rsquo;s a large dog &amp; would fit, but then I would be stuck in one spot &amp; wouldn&rsquo;t be very comfy.Another thing I was concerned about with choosing such a short kayak is how it would track. All the other ones I was considering were 10-12 ft, so this was my shortest option. I ultimately decided to prioritize ease of transportation over quality of ride on the water. However, I really don&rsquo;t feel like I lost much. This thing tracks really well for being so short. I mostly paddle around lakes on day trips, so it&rsquo;s not like I needed some kind of serious touring model. I&rsquo;m also excited to try it out in the surf. Never tried that but it looks like fun.My only negative mention is the shipping time. To be fair, they do say shipping could take 1-2 months (it only took a month), so it&rsquo;s not any surprise. It&rsquo;s just a long time to wait.</p>

<h5 id="narrow-seat-but-great-value">Narrow seat but great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first kayak purchase and I was super excited to get the yellow Frenzy - all of the reviews I&rsquo;ve read online were positive emphasizing stability, durability, light weight and great price (I agree with all of the above). Obviously I purchased this product online, so I was eager to see it in person. I rushed to unwrap it like a kid on Christmas morning, and when I went to sit in it, I was disappointed to feel how snug I fit in the seat. I am a plus size lady and my husband is a 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; XL guy and we made our final purchase decision based on weight capacity and width of the kayak (31&rdquo;, wider than most). HOWEVER, the mold of the seat is a mere 18&rdquo;, narrower than most! I am on a weight loss journey, so by summer&rsquo;s end this will be a mute point for me but I think it is imperative for extra-large kayakers to beware.On a positive note, there is ample leg room, my husband&rsquo;s long legs fit well and I am able to stretch out my legs completely (this will be great for lounging back in my yak and taking in the summer sun!) Over all I am satisfied with the Ocean Kayak - Frenzy, it is a quality product at an affordable price.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-kayak">This is a Great Kayak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kayak is everything promised. Wonderful. Very steady to paddle and very stable. I can take it out alone. Hope to find another for my husband.</p>

<h5 id="go-have-some-fun-and-get-an-ocean-kayak">Go have some fun and get an Ocean Kayak!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy with this purchase. I tested other kayaks at a local rental shop and found the Ocean Kayak to be much better at tracking than the others&hellip;looks cool too! I purchased the orange/yellow. The shipment arrived on time and the delivery guys were a helping hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-kayak">love this kayak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got back from a 3 hour trip on ln this kayak and absolutely love it. It tracks really good and goes fast with little effort if you want to go fast. I am almost 5&rsquo;8 and when my legs are stretched out there is about 6 inches of space before the end of the leg hold. The seat that comes with it is very comfortable and supportive on the back,but could use a little more cush on the seat. I like the molded foot holds better than the adjustable ones because if I want to move my feet to a different position I don&rsquo;t have to mess with readjusting anything. I got in and out of the kayak twice and never felt as if it was going tip. Very stable kayak.It is a great kayak. I will say though that if you a&rsquo;re a big person check out the dimensions. I am 5&rsquo; 8 and 135 and if I was much larger it might be tight. For me it is perfect</p>

<h5 id="look-no-further-get-out-on-the-water">Look no further&hellip; get out on the water!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second Kayak Frenzy that we have purchased!!! We love the design and how they stack into each other easily. To make me even happier, they fit in the underbay of my RV!!!! These handle beautifully in the water &ndash; they are much tougher to tip than a canoe. When I was in my 20&rsquo;s, I taught canoeing and kayaking, so I have &ldquo;tested&rdquo; several dozen models of small watercraft &ndash; these are my favorite!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">Worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was hoping for. Costs quite a bit more than some comparable sit on top kayaks, but worth it! Well built, light weight.Looking forward to putting it in the water</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-wish-i-had-bought-this-sooner">I wish I had bought this sooner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice versatile little kayak! Got this to add another kayak to my fleet. Ran Class II rapids this past weekend and love this purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-kayak">Great little kayak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So much fun. Easy to carry and load. What a blast. I added the scupper plugs to stay dry.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<p>Multipurpose kayak with utility for transport and storage and use on the water.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<p>Tracks very well. Buy small scupper plugs if you don&rsquo;t want to get wet.</p>

<p>In my opinion its one of the better sit on top kayaks. You do need a proper back support, but it handles very well, it is very tough, it has a higher than average weight limit and&hellip;</p>
