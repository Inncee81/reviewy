<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="seems-like-a-knock-off">Seems like a knock off.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought these before, but this time the brushes do not seem legit Sonicare brushes. They seem like a knock off. I first noticed it when putting the brush on the handle. It was VERY tight going on. I almost felt like I was breaking the handle I had to push so hard down. Then when I went to take the head off, the head broke a the base. It became two pieces, which has never happened before. The base of the head was stuck on the toothbrush handle. I had to use a screwdriver to pry it off. I have never had that happen with legit Sonicare heads, but I have read that it happens to knock offs. It seems to me that they either went cheaper on their product or this isnt a legit Sonicare head.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesnt-fit-on-brush">DOESNT FIT ON BRUSH</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Saw all the reviews, ordered 2 packages. They don&rsquo;t fit properly on brush and keep falling off! The channel inside is too narrow. I don&rsquo;t understand where all these fake 5 star reviews have come from. DONT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!! Beware!!Purchased for Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 HealthyWhite R732 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="effective-and-comfortable-use">Effective and Comfortable Use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works perfectly with my Sonicare Flexcare electric toothbrush. They last well with daily use, are soft and easy on the gums yet effective in cleaning the teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sensitive-head-quality-control">Sensitive Head Quality Control</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have used the Philips Sonicare for years. Always order the sensitive heads online because they are not typically stocked in stores. However, the manufacturer&rsquo;s qualty control on the last batch was sub-standard. The hole in the brush head is too large for the vibratory shaft, resulting in abnormal noise during brushing.Hopefully this is a one time issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sonicare-brush-heads-happy-customer">Sonicare Brush Heads - Happy Customer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never purchased anything from Amazon and was in need of the Sonicare brush heads and decided to go onto Amazon to make the purchase instead of driving to the store. I have been using the Sonicare for over 2 years now and was tired of going to the store and trying to figure out which brush head was the correct one. The service was great, I received the product earlier than was expected, the brush heads were the exact ones I needed. I will definately be using Amazon services again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-buying-at-local-store">Better than buying at local store</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the past couple years I&rsquo;ve been purchasing these replacement heads from Amazon. The price from Amazon, especially with subscribe and save, is 5-10 dollars cheaper than the local store. Shipping is usually free.I prefer the sensitive brushes because of my delicate gums but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t keep your teeth clean. I brush once a day and every dentist appointment I have a clean bill of health. The Sonicare brush itself is better than other competitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have sensitive teeth and gums, and these new brush heads were just the ticket! They are much softer and still work as good, if not better than the standard brush heads. Many people think that you need firmer bristles to clean your teeth, but actually, softer ones are better for your gums, and remove just as much plaque as firm ones with the added benefit of being able to bend and reach harder to clean spots better than the firm bristles.Will definitely be purchasing again when I need a new set!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="phillips-sonic-care-sensitive">Phillips sonic care sensitive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very fast shipment, thank you, I like these heads better than all the other sonic care heads, the other ones are very stiff and aggressive, these clean very well and if your teeth are sensitive..these are a must have, great product with great results</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for sensitive gums. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to use Sonicare without them!</p>
