<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="the-stock-line-is-not-the-best-not-surprising">The stock line is not the best (not surprising)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very impressed with this trimmer. I have had it for about 8 months and have used it hard. The stock line is not the best (not surprising), but strung with Oregon Nylium, it cuts through most everything I&rsquo;ve encountered. On normal mode, it has plenty of power for most tasks and on the boosted setting, it is comparable to any gas trimmer I&rsquo;ve used (various echos and Stihls).What&rsquo;s really impressive to me is that it has enough power to successfully run a tiller attachments. I bought the Ryobi Expand-it tiller (excellent BTW) and ran the trimmer on the boosted setting. It allowed me to till a ~12x12 foot garden (starting with grass&hellip;so I had to cut through the sod) on roughly 1.5 4.0 Ah batteries. I ran the turbo setting for several minutes at a time (limited by my own endurance) and the unit never got hot or complained. The torque of the brushless motor was impressive, and arguably better for cutting through tough sod than a lot of gas trimmers would be. I was, frankly, astonished at how long the batteries lasted when I consider how much work they were doing. I don&rsquo;t know that I would have enough endurance to go through more than 2 batteries&rsquo; worth of tilling in a day. I&rsquo;m very sore as I write this!I have the majority of the 40V digipro lineup (mower, weed-trimmer, air compressor, blower/vac, 16&rdquo; chainsaw, and my dad has the hedge trimmer) and all of them impress me quite a bit. I won&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re professional-level tools, but for a homeowner, they certainly get the job done. I have confidence that they will last me an appropriate amount of time for the price paid and the power/battery life is comparable to gas tools IMHO.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-was-even-more-satisfied-with-this-weed-eater">I was even more satisfied with this weed eater</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this weed eater shortly after being pleasently surprised by one of the Greenworks mowers . I was even more satisfied with this weed eater, plenty of power (figures, electric motors are torquey) and the battery life lasted a reasonable time (came half charged and I used it for 40min, still indicated it was a quarter charged, should have taken the multimeter to it for better numbers).My only complaint is that there is a little bit of a slow build up of speed after pressing the trigger, the response is a bit slower than I would expect to find on a gasoline powered weedeater. I assume this is probably a design choice, since it takes nothing to speed up that motor and I imagine that natively the electric motor is probably too quick of a spin up in comparison so they programmed in a delay. Could be the motor driver, but I doubt the hardware has any problem speeding that thing up to max rpm nearly instantaneously so I&rsquo;m hoping that it&rsquo;s an easy driver to hack.The only other thing that I wanted to add was that one of the bolts was cut pretty poorly and left a sharp thread hanging off the bolt that sliced right through my finger. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not likely to be a problem on every weed eater, but just something to look out for during installation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="replaced-my-gas-trimmers">Replaced my Gas Trimmers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of power. Be sure to double check to make sure all the screws are tight. I put blue LockTite on all of the screws that thread into metal. I forgot to make sure the trimmer head was tight. As soon as I fired up the trimmer, the head flew off, rolled down my steep mountain house drive way and disappeared in thick woods. Unable to find it, I installed an aftermarket trimmer head and all is well. Although not quite as powerful as my gas trimmer, it gets the job done with a whole lot less fatigue. I have two 4 amp hour batteries but rarely use the second one because by the time the first one is depleted, I have had enough of weed eating for the day&hellip;..about 30-40 minutes.Edit: I&rsquo;ve done some pretty serious work with this unit and blown through a couple of acres of tough stuff. Unlike my gas trimmer which can completely stall out if I really get in the rough, this units on board computer will shut it off if you get it into something it can&rsquo;t handle or you get a little too greedy. The big difference is that all you need do is release the trigger for a split second, and the unit starts up again. My comparable gas powered trimmer would have to be restarted&hellip;major PIA. So, this trimmer goes up a notch in my book. Also, while not 100% certain, I believe this Trimmer has a thermal protection circuit to protect the motor from overheating. The high power setting really eats up the weeds, but seems to eat the battery up much faster as would be expected. It&rsquo;s easy to toggle between high and low on the fly.</p>

<p>This is my first electric weed eater and it did not disappoint. I have yet to find a job around my yard that it cannot handle. The GMAX 40v is substantial in build and quality.</p>

<p>Very strong unit. better than my old gas powered weed eater straight shaft that died after less than two years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a gas trimmer for years. I just got tired of the gas trimmer&rsquo;s tendency to run poorly. It was always something that slowed thework down.</p>

<h5 id="need-tougher-string">Need Tougher String</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The string is the flaw in the product. Very flimsy leading to a very small cutting diameter. Cuts grass closer to the spool rather than the guard.</p>
