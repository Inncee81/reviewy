Product Description
From the makers of the no.1 recommended sonic toothbrush brand by dental professionals, Philips Sonicare has created an easier effective way to floss. Philips Sonicare Airfloss removes 99% more plaque than a manual toothbrush alone as well as cleans in-between all teeth in 60 seconds, using only 1 tsp of water. Airfloss uses a micro-droplet technology which removes plaque in a single burst and is safe and gentle on the teeth and gums, at the same time helps prevent tooth decay. This device is safe and gentle for implants, veneers, and orthodontic brackets. You will experience noticeable results and a better check-up in 28 days or your money back.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
If flossing isn&rsquo;t a regular part of your oral care routine, the Philips Sonicare AirFloss can give you an easy, effective way to clean between your teeth. It features microburst technology that delivers air and microdroplets of water or mouth rinse to remove plaque between teeth, and it&rsquo;s proven safe and gentle on gums and teeth. With one-button functionality and a guidance tip that ensures targeted cleaning, Sonicare AirFloss can quickly clean your entire mouth in just 60 seconds. AirFloss takes the hassle out of flossing so you can get a deep clean every day.</p>

<p>Microburst Technology Cleans More Effectively
The Sonicare Airfloss&rsquo;s microburst technology applies a quick burst of pressurized air and micro-water droplets to clean deep between teeth where a toothbrush can&rsquo;t reach and with less mess than oral irrigators. This gentle yet effective technology removes more plaque between teeth than brushing with a manual toothbrush alone.</p>

<p>Slim Nozzle and Guidance Tip for Hard-to-Reach Areas
The easy-to-hold ergonomic handle features a slim, angled nozzle for easy access to all areas of your mouth and a guidance tip for proper nozzle placement. The guidance tip makes it easy to find the spaces between teeth and place the tip at the appropriate angle for maximum cleaning. Simply guide it along the gumline until you feel it settle between the teeth.</p>

<p>Easy-to-Fill Reservoir
An easy-to-fill reservoir holds 2 teaspoons of water for two full uses. It can also be filled with mouthwash for added oral health benefits and a fresh feeling.</p>

<p>Rechargeable Battery Lasts Two Weeks per Charge
The AirFloss features a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and multi-voltage charger designed to last two weeks (or 14 uses) on a single charge. A battery indicator light in the power button blinks when it&rsquo;s time to recharge. For added convenience, the AirFloss fits standard Sonicare chargers, eliminating the need for multiple chargers with Sonicare products.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-and-very-effective-way-for-those-who-should-floss-more">A great and very effective way for those who should floss more.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I must disclose that I work in the Healthcare/ Dental industry. I encounter a lot people everyday who need to floss more or wish flossing was easier, including myself. It should be noted that this is not a form of advice in any way or matter, the opinions here are just my personal thoughts on the device.Gums, bleeding and Flossinggums bleed if bacteria grows in the form of plaque on your teeth. Bacteria uses calcium from you saliva to form plaque. Plaque/Calculus form on all surfaces of the teeth and is easily removed by brushing. The problem is with plaque that forms under the gum and in between the teeth. Your body tries to kill the bacteria by pumping more blood to the gums to fight it (inflammation) and thus gums bleed.Compared to other oral irrigation devices:I have used the Waterpik for a couple of years and was a little skeptical when I first used the Sonicare. As apposed to the Waterpik, the Sonicare air flosser uses interrupted air/water mist to clean between the teeth. Waterpik uses a continuous jet stream. I was skeptical because the reservoir in the waterpik is 210ml and the air flosser holds about a table spoon full. More about that later.How it works:The concept is that if you push water hard enough through the spaces between teeth the water stream will carry with it any food or debris that are stuck there and thus less food for the bacteria to grow on. There is a major difference between that and brushing/flossing. When you floss or brush, you interrupt the formation of plaque. So no the air flosser will not remove plaque. Here is where the air flosser will work, the more food you have between your teeth, the more resources the bacteria will have to form plaque and calculus. by using the air flosser you slow down this process.How to use:I use a mouth wash to fill it up instead of water in the hope that some of that will be retained between my teeth and kill bacteria that is growing there.you take the tip and fit it interproximally between 2 teeth from the outside (labial: lip side) and activate, move to the next 2 teeth and repeat until you do the whole mouth. I activate the water jet twice for every space from the lip side and once from the tongue side (lingual). sonicare does not recommend this because they are afraid that you might over do it and damage your gums. I dont advocate it either so do at your own risk. I just dont feel one pump will remove everything. Now this is a problem for me because I find I have to fill up the reservoir 2 or 3 times to do the whole mouth.Many people complain that it makes a mess, but with time it will become easy, just keep your mouth closed.Who is it and is it not for:If you use floss and do it regularly then this is not for you. what you are doing is way better habit.If you have tight contacts, you know because when you eat meat nothing sticks between your teeth, this is not for you.Now if you have wide contacts, and you know because you cant eat a taco without reaching for anything to clean between your teeth, then this is for you.If you tried flossing and you really cant get yourself to do it no matter what, then this is for you and way better than nothing.If your gums bleed every time you brush or floss then pushing some of that mouthwash in there might actually help by reducing the number of bacteria and the food available for it to grow.When you go to your dentist and get a deep cleaning, the dentist uses a sonic instrument to disrupt the plaque and to break it down. This is ultimately what you need if your gums bleed. once the plaque is gone and you floss/brush/air floss, the formation of plaque is inhibited and your gums live happy, bacteria free.</p>

<h5 id="quality-at-it-s-lowest">Quality at it&rsquo;s lowest!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After almost one Year of use, my Philips Sonicare gave up the ghost. It had worked in a satisfactory way until then, easily holding a charge for up to one month!Being still within factory warranty, I received a replacement BUT! it seemed like a whole new (worse) product. the button &ldquo;trigger) did not easily engage, and the Philips Sonicare died after about one week. As I had extended warranty, I again called Philips, and was again sent a replacement unit. - This happened three times, all units died within a few weeks of use, and the &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; performance on all replacements was very sluggish. I now have four non working units, and guess what, I am NOT going to buy another.I certainly hope others have had a better experience, but for me, it is two thumbs down.</p>

<h5 id="unique-idea-on-electric-flossing-still-no-replacement-for-manual-string-flossing">Unique idea on electric flossing; still no replacement for manual string flossing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used other water picks before, and this one is unique in that it only fires a single shot when it&rsquo;s placed between your teeth, so it&rsquo;s less wasteful; that said, if you don&rsquo;t have it lined up perfectly, you&rsquo;ll need to repeat the shot, which is only a problem because the reservoir on it is SUPER small, you really only get one shot per tooth intersection. They should increase it by a half oz or something, so that you can have a couple extra sprays, because you almost never get them all perfect.It does blast food and debris out of your teeth, but just doesn&rsquo;t do as good of a job as flossing with string. When I stopped using this product (or flossing, period) because of the inconvenience of the SUPER small reservoir for a few weeks, then went back to using floss sticks, I could feel they got my mouth WAY cleaner; it was definitely a blood bath again! Floss gets between your teeth and gums SO much better, and you can&rsquo;t grow new teeth, so I haven&rsquo;t used the Airfloss in months, and as soon as I finish typing this review, I&rsquo;m putting it away for storage (lord knows what I&rsquo;ll use it for, though&hellip;).TL;DR Novel idea, absolutely doesn&rsquo;t replace traditional flossing. Would not buy again, and would return it if I could.Bonus: The Sonicare toothbrush, however, is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD (and why I tried this product in the first place), and I HATE brushing my teeth with anything else. You really feel like you just went to the dentist every day, and when you use an old fashioned manual toothbrush, you feel like an artist trying to paint a portrait using a floor mop, it just can&rsquo;t be done well. I take it on vacations with me, and it stays charged for a week (never been away from the charger longer than that). The toothbrush is an absolute must buy!</p>
