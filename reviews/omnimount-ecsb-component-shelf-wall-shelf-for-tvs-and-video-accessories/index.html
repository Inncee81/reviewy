<h5 id="the-best-projector-shelf-for-an-epson-5020-by-far">The BEST projector shelf for an Epson 5020 by far!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to give this shelf at least a year of use before I wrote the review. Some may think that&rsquo;s too long, and some may wonder why I would wait that long, especially for such a shelf, but I&rsquo;m using it to hold an 18lb Epson 5020 projector. I had looked at different mounts for quite some time, but due to the pitch of the ceiling in my media/theater room, I had to utilize a shelf, and this has proved to be the best choice I could have made.We installed this shelf with drywall toggle-bolts VS hitting a stud, as doing this would give me the most centered placement of the shelf on my back wall. Even with this method of mount, the shelf has worked perfectly.Regarding how far it sticks out from the wall&hellip;yes, it does. I haven&rsquo;t measured but 4-5&rdquo; seems about right. BUT, in my case, the Epson 5020 fills up about 97% of the glass space, leaving some room at the back for the HDMI &amp; power cable to not be tightly-bent when attached. I do NOT see this as any kind of a design FLAW, rather a positive move on the design to compensate for LARGE home theater projectors, AVR&rsquo;s, etc&hellip;If you are using a Pico or other &lsquo;small&rsquo; projector, OF COURSE this is going to be too large for you. But do NOT blame the product when your projector or ______ device fills up 1/8th the space provided by the shelf. It would be like faulting a home builder for adding a 3 car garage when you only want to put a bicycle in there. These types of comments always frustrate me, because for MY use (and probably many other who have used it like me or WILL use it like me), this shelf deserves HONEST and ACCURATE reviews from people who use it as it was designed to be used.Overall, again, if you have to shelf-mount your projector, this is an EXCELLENT choice. I would easily choose this again if decide to shelf-mount another projector in our home. BUT, if you aren&rsquo;t planning on using a LARGE (think 18-25lb in the roughly 18-20&rdquo; x 15-17&rdquo; range, then clearly you are looking at a shelf you shouldn&rsquo;t be, this will be extremely overkill, and only YOUR fault for ordering it.</p>

<h5 id="quality-shelf-plastic-cable-channel-cover-could-stay-on-more-securely">Quality Shelf - Plastic Cable Channel Cover Could Stay On More Securely</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this component wall shelf. It was installed pretty easily by the company that mounted my new flat screen TV. It seems quite solid, and is supporting my components just fine.I do have two slight negative comments, which are the reasons this is a four-star and not a five-star review. The first is that while this shelf can be installed at angles to the wall, there is no way to easily lock it into one position. I have it tightened pretty well into a straight position, but it is possible to move it, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be. It should just lock. The other minor negative point is that the cover for the cable channel does not stay on as securely as it might.Overall, though, I am pleased with my purchase of this glass component shelf.I hope you found this review helpful. On the other hand, if you did not find this review helpful, I’d be interested in hearing why, so that I can attempt to edit it and make it more helpful to both you and others. If you leave a comment on the review, suggesting how it would be more helpful, I promise to respond to your comment, and to attempt to incorporate your suggestion in my review, if it is at all possible for me to do so. My goal is to write reviews that help people, as I have been helped by the reviews others have written. Thanks!</p>

<h5 id="get-this-it-works-and-looks-fantastic">Get this, it works and looks fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This solved my turntable issues. I recently moved into a home and had hardwood floors installed. I put a record on and stepped back and the needle bounced all over the place. Well I did some trouble shooting and found out this is a common problem with wood floors. Solution, mount your TT on the wall. I did and what a difference ! No more skipping and no more feedback! I can crank it up and no more loud humming or feedback. So it was a double bonus. Highly recommended. Thank you Omnimount !</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-large-heavy-projectors">Perfect for large/heavy projectors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this for a wall mount for my 5040UB projector, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. It&rsquo;s like this wall shelf was made for the 5040! Perfect size and fit, but it does take some torque to get the arm to hold in the right position. Keep in mind what I&rsquo;m using is near the max weight limit! Mounted directly into a stud, and it is holding very strong. I will purchase a second once I step up my audio game and get a dedicated receiver, this will be to mount that directly below the 5040!</p>

<h5 id="tough-metal-and-plate-glass-make-sure-you-have-a-strong-wall-to-install-to">Tough Metal and Plate Glass &ndash; Make Sure You Have a Strong Wall to Install To</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Heavyweight and sturdy. And super attractive. The combination of polished black metal and that clear plate glass shelf is so incredibly elegant. When you hold it in your hand, everything feels solid, powerful, elegant, heavy. Definitely worth the price.The plastic cover that goes over the wall mount also has vertical wiring channels in it, so you can take everything sitting on the shelf and run the wires back to the wall, then straight up or straight down. Neat wires make a huge difference when you&rsquo;re displaying your equipment on glass!Make sure you apply it to an equally sturdy section of your wall. You can see that the shelf forms a much longer lever than the wall mount; it goes into the wall with only a screw on the top and a screw on the bottom. Any weight you put on the shelf will be trying pretty hard to yank that top screw out. In my case, I didn&rsquo;t have studs where I needed them. It went in well with wall anchors in dry wall, but that&rsquo;s not how they recommend it. We&rsquo;ll see how it holds up &ndash; it feels solid now even with some electronics sitting on the shelf, but that&rsquo;s until some kid tries to yank on it. If it doesn&rsquo;t hold up, the weak spot will be the wall, not the shelf or the screws. The shelf itself is massive and tough.</p>

<h5 id="great-mount">Great mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this shelf for my A/V receiver relaying on reviews here. This was smart decision. First, it&rsquo;s easy to install. Second, it looks very elegant. Third, it holds my receiver and speaker on top of it. Forth, it even rotates left to right. Do buy it if you are looking for wall mount for your component.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-shelf-sticks-out-too-far">The shelf sticks out too far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quality product with attractive looks. However, it sticks out very far from the wall. If you, unlike me, have no problem with space, then go for it. However, people who have limited space should consider another shelf. Don&rsquo;t worry about the picture they put up because it&rsquo;s deceiving ! It makes the product seem as if doesn&rsquo;t stick out much.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-projector-stand">Great Projector stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as a Sony 45ES Projector. Good quality and solid. My projector used to shake due to strong bass and as result it made the screen looks shaky. This stops it from vibrating.</p>

<p>Arrived as described. Good quality fit and finish and easily supported my Marantz turntable. Easy installation too.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-don-t-have-a-tivo-bolt-this-could-be-ideal">If you don&rsquo;t have a Tivo Bolt, this could be ideal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This could be a two star or five star depending on what you want. For with with only a DVD, TiVo Bolt, Access Pt, and Apple TV it&rsquo;s small.</p>

<h5 id="good-looking-easy-mount">Good looking/easy mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>if you are looking for a larger shelf(Stereo receiver etc)this is a good looking quality shelf.It can hold up to 30 lbs,and the glass is nice and thick.Mounts quickly,easily.</p>

<p>Great shelf! Been looking for a shelf to hold my projector. Looks sleek and plenty of space to put your electronics on. The glass is a bit heavier than I thought.</p>

<h5 id="definitely-recommended">Definitely recommended</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good mount for my projector. The only con I have to say about it is that when I touch the mount to move it I hear a clicking noise from the base of my mount into my&hellip;</p>

<p>Gigantic glass shelf sits way to far from the wall. The picture is deceiving, the glass shelf is actually floating out into the room far away from the wall.</p>
