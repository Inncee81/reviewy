<h5 id="another-great-roku-despite-the-fan">Another great Roku despite the fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Roku devices for many years starting with a Roku 2 XS. I&rsquo;m not a fan of Apple products and want a neutral streaming device that covers all major streaming services so Roku was the natural choice. There have been software issues here and there over the years but they have been minor and swiftly dealt with. When the Roku 4 came out I bought it without question. Sure my Roku 3 is still running just fine but I&rsquo;m a sucker for the latest and greatest. Just as I expected the Roku 4 is a little faster, doesn&rsquo;t crash, there are no software glitches and has the same simple and functional interface. Unfortunately I appear to be one of the few that received a less than quiet fan. I must admit that not having a fan was a huge plus on the previous units. Hopefully a future hardware revision will substitute with a larger heat sink or more energy efficient processor to eliminate that failure point. Luckily it turned out to be easy to upgrade the heat sink myself although not very pretty, an old Intel heat sink, zip ties and a very voided warranty. My very quiet home theater is now totally quiet again. For anyone who is curious about the internals enjoy the pictures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fix it Solution to keep it from running hot under 10dollarsI bought 2 new Roku 4 units tested them for any fan noises&hellip;mine work great out of the box .. But they do run HOT it&rsquo;s ok here is what you do 1- buy a fan like eBay item # 191501624749 cheap but works perfect the fan is just larger than the Roku unit plug right into the Roku USB port..it&rsquo;s very quiet! It has a led but it could be cut off so that it don&rsquo;t shinethis alone will get you by just fine but I went one step further and got Amazon item &ndash;Square Self Adhesive Rubber Pads for Furniture12mmx12mmx6mm 12 in 1 they are perfect size for it &hellip; This will keep the Roku off the table high enough to keep it cool and free airflow around it&hellip;Anyone of these solutions will keep your Roku 4 running much much cooler thus it will last longerHope this helps someone like my post if you like my solution</p>

<h5 id="poor-product-and-bad-customer-support-don-t-buy">Poor product and bad customer support. Don&rsquo;t buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After owning a Roku 4 for 4 months, I&rsquo;ll share my experiences.The Roku 4 worked fine for the first 3 months and I was happy with it overall. I wanted a 4k streaming device that supported multi-channel audio. I also wanted a platform that had the widest range of compatibility, so the Roku 4 fit the bill. The menu and controls were more responsive than my smartTV (Samsung from 2013). Netflix and Amazon Prime worked well without any probs. The remote is just ok. I don&rsquo;t like the dedicated channel buttons, especially since I don&rsquo;t use rdio or sling. It would be nice to be able to configure those for channels I actually use.Starting last month, my Roku 4&rsquo;s fan started running constantly and making strange noises that I could hear 2 rooms away. I thought other reviewers were exaggerating about the noise, but it is LOUD. I contacted customer service to report the issue and worked through their suggested steps of rebooting the thing, unplugging it, resetting it, and plugging it into a different power outlet (c&rsquo;mon, really???). After troubleshooting for an hour and getting nowhere, tech said that the sound was &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. Later, I found out that some Roku 4s were shipped without a thermal pad between the CPU and heatsink, which resulted in the loud fan noise. I spent another 45 minutes with customer support to RMA the device. They said that they would send me an e-mail with shipping instructions and I would get a replacement after I sent my device back. I&rsquo;m used to RMA processes where the manufacturer puts a hold on my credit card, sends me a replacement device, and releases the hold after I send the defective item back, so I found the idea of not having my streaming device for 10 days very inconvenient, especially since the manufacturer was at fault. It was moot anyway, because the shipping instructions were never sent and I am too tired to waste my time with Roku support again. Anyway, now the Roku 4 is shutting down randomly and also freezes up almost every other day.</p>

<p> My Roku 4 sounds like a Diesel !!! I use it to create special sound effects in my home movies. Roku 4 makes huge noise from inside the box! It is impossible to watch it. It is super hot too! You can fry eggs on it !</p>

<h5 id="love-roku-3-hate-roku-4">Love Roku 3 Hate Roku 4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How in the world did the people who developed the Roku 3 allow this (oversized, extremely hot and VERY noisy) Roku 4 to ship out to loyal Roku customers??? I feel completely betrayed by Roku! Clearly someone dropped the ball. First time I heard the fan, my wife and I looked at each other and asked &ldquo;who&rsquo;s running the vacuum cleaner&rdquo;? Called tech support and they act like they know nothing about this problem. I guess they didn&rsquo;t read all the blogs that have been blowing up since Thursday&rsquo;s release. &ldquo;Come on Roku, wake up, you&rsquo;ve got a real problem on your hands&rdquo;. Waiting for return authorization and I&rsquo;m done!Update: As of 11/11/15 have not received my refund. Returned my unit on 10/25/15 and they claim they never received it even though I have the FedEx receipt that they signed for the package. So on 11/7/15 they are escalating this case to the &ldquo;concern team&rdquo;. Haven&rsquo;t heard back. So BAD UNIT, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!</p>
