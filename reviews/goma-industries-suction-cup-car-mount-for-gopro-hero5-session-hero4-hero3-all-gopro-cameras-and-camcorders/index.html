<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-great-mount">A Great Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a windshield suction cup mount that was smaller than the GoPro branded mount and the GOMA mount met all my expectations. It is definitely smaller, but the suction cup is still quite strong. It is well made and the smaller size makes it less obtrusive when mounted to my windshield. The only complaint, and a minor one, is the size of the faux leather storage bag. It is a bit too small and it takes a bit of wrangling to get the mount to fit inside. No biggie and it shouldn&rsquo;t deter anyone from purchasing this mount. My order arrived on time in a padded envelope. I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to order from this company again should the need arise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mount-for-indoor-skydiving">Great Mount for Indoor Skydiving</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife is a competition indoor skydiver, and two of the tunnels she trains at have really dodgy camera mounts for people to use. The level and angle aren&rsquo;t ideal, that part of the tunnel glass is dirty or &ldquo;foggy&rdquo;, or (worst of all) the mount isn&rsquo;t secure and the camera can slip and tilt whilst she&rsquo;s in the tunnel training (losing valuable training footage).The GOMA suction cup mount is absolutely brilliant for solving this problem. She can place it at the spot of her choosing, which is great because sometimes she wants to film from different angles/levels. The mount stays firmly in place on the tunnel plexiglass wall (and there&rsquo;s a lot of vibration from the fans). The design of the mount allows her to position the camera lens right up against the glass, which help prevents distortion and reflection issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-have-bought-two-of-them">Highly recommended, have bought two of them!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing mount! Holds a Go-Pro or Garmin VIRB securely in place. Extremely well made, you can feel the quality and tell the company behind it worked hard to create a great product. I love it so much I purchased an additional mount. VERY HIGHLY recommend this mount if you&rsquo;re looking for a suction cup rig.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-mount-for-the-price">Nice mount for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Picked this up as a cheap alternative to the GoPro branded version. I did some research prior to buying because suction cup mounted devices are generally a hit or a miss. I chose this one based on the reviews it has received so far. It seems very well made, and the suction cup is quite strong. I have not used it in changing temperatures, so I cannot attest to that yet, but it seems it will do its job. It comes with a handy carrying case that will keep the suction cup itself from getting dirty, so that&rsquo;s a plus - but it&rsquo;s awkward shape will prevent you from putting it in most cases that are designed for the GoPro at this point. Not a big deal, but worth noting.In summary, this mount is absolutely worth the money, and a deal compared to the price of the GoPro branded mount. Pick one up, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-well-built">Highly Recommended! Well built!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this Suction Cup Mount about a week ago and has been using it and testing it out. I&rsquo;m very impressed on how well it works. It&rsquo;s very sturdy once you lock it to the windshield. I tried to shake the base with my hand to see what the amount of play it has, and surprisingly it didn&rsquo;t move anywhere. I also have other windshield suction cup mount besides this GOMA suction cup, but the lock seems loose. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a defect or something, but when I tried to shake the base a to see if it has any kind of play, and it does. It&rsquo;s been very hot here in Texas for the past couple weeks, and so far this GOMA suction cup mount been great standing up to it. My other suction cup seems to be a little loose when it get&rsquo;s hot, but not this GOMA suction cup. Anyhow, so far I&rsquo;m very satisfied with this GOMA suction cup mount. Highly recommended. For that being said, the durability of it I do not know just yet as I only had this for a week. I will try to post another review and let you know about the durability of it.Oh, didn&rsquo;t mention about the nice faux leather bag that it comes with. It&rsquo;s nice to have it, but I find that you don&rsquo;t really need it for the mount once it&rsquo;s lock on your windshield. However, it&rsquo;s nice to put your GoPro in to avoid scratches when putting away your GoPro when your car is parked. If you&rsquo;re using it for a dash cam :)This is just an honest review. The company did not gave me the product or any discount for this review.</p>

<h5 id="best-suction-cup-on-the-market-highly-recommend">Best suction cup on the market, highly recommend!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased this I was a little hesitant to use this product as most suction cups I&rsquo;ve ever used in the past just sucked. After using this product and constantly checking it for the first 30 mins I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere without actually trying to take it off which was also difficult because of the suction. This is an awesome product, the name &ldquo;Best go pro suction cup mount&rdquo; is very accurate! Its suction is amazing. Used it on the freeway at about 70 mph, then went off roading, mounted it on the outside of my brother&rsquo;s Rubicon And it stayed for about 5 hours without ever feeling like it was going to come off.Overall great suction cup to trust your expensive go pro with, can mount it on the inside or outside. Its a bonus that it comes with a tether that I also used. If your looking for a suction cup for your go pro or any other action cam (with go pro attachment via screw in adapter, can be found on amazon) then don&rsquo;t hesitate to buy this!</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="yi-4k-yes-g7x-no">Yi 4K+ yes, G7X no.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works fine with my Yi 4K+ action camera attached to my windshield.My Canon G7X Mark II is a bit heavy for it. It would likely be fine standing up on a flat surface with the G7X (my dash is not smooth), but I wouldn&rsquo;t leave a larger compact camera like the G7X attached to it while suctioned to a vertical surface.</p>

<blockquote>
