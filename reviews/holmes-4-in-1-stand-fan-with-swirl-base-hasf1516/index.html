<h5 id="used-to-be-a-quiet-fan-in-the-past-but-no-longer">Used to be a quiet fan in the past, but no longer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have one of these fans that I purchased maybe six years ago and love it due to the durability and how quiet it was. It&rsquo;s still working, but I decided to order a new one before my old one eventually dies just so I&rsquo;ll have it on hand. (That&rsquo;s how much I really liked this fan!) I have read about the cap problem on the newer versions of this fan, but I read a great solution someone provided on here, which was to replace the cap with an 8 mm reverse thread nut. So, before I even bought the new fan, I ordered the replacement nut online. (Cost me about $11 for five of them, from the UK.) And, lo and behold, the nut fit when I got the fan, so I was psyched. However&hellip;this new fan is too loud for me. (I will admit I like it really quiet, else I can&rsquo;t sleep with it.) As I stated, I still have my old fan, so it&rsquo;s easy to compare the two. They look exactly alike (except for color), but the motor is really amped up on the newer version. In a side by side test, the low setting on this new fan is at least as loud/fast and the second setting on my old fan. Now, maybe this won&rsquo;t bother most of you, but I can&rsquo;t sleep with it. The second setting on the new fan is WAY loud, and forget about the third setting. Because I bought this specific fan because of its quietness&hellip;and because I went out of my way to buy a special nut to replace the cap which is now known to break&hellip;I am very disappointed. It would be okay to use on the first setting in the daytime, but as I said, the motor on this one is different that it used to be. Admittedly, maybe some of you would like the extra power. But, no longer considered a quiet fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-quiet-but-poorly-constructed">Very quiet, but poorly constructed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan is very quite however, the nut holding the fan blade onto the motor shaft is horribly made. after 6 hours of use it had broken causing the fan blade to come loose inside the housing. I had Amazon send a replacement fan thinking it was just 1 bad part. The replacement one made it 2 days before the fan blade nut broke. The problem is the fan blade nut is made entirely of plastic (previous Holmes fans have used a metal nut surrounded by plastic for aesthetic appeal.) the fan motor shaft gets very hot during use and I guess that is what causes the fan blade nut to break. I really did like the fan and even tried going to a large hardware store to find a nut that would fit I could get nothing to work it is larger than 8mm and smaller than 9mm it also does not fit using any American sizes. I went with a Lasko fan and so far am enjoying that fan</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-have-gave-it-a-five-star-if">I would have gave it a five star, if &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have gave it a five star, if not for the plastic capnut that holds on the fan blade. It broke apart within a couple of hours of use. I bought three units. I had to buy special hardware. I bought M8-1.25mm pitch reverse thread nuts plus ordinary <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch washers. I could not find the nuts at my local hardware store. I had to order them online. Holmes should use a metal nut and washer instead. It would eliminate the capnut breaking up, rendering the unit useless.After reassembling the fan blade assemblies, I have had no problems with these fans. They have decent airflow. The swirl base makes them stabile, and easy to move around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-after-less-than-2-weeks-of-use">broke after less than 2 weeks of use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: This fan was delivered on 7/31/14. On 8/11/14, less than 2 weeks of normal use later, it no longer works. The threaded cylinder on the cap that holds the fan blades in place broke into three pieces. I attempted to fix it with superglue, but had to call Amazon to get a refund in the end.ORIGINAL REVIEW: The word that comes to mind is &ldquo;boopty&rdquo;, as in very cheaply made and of low quality. For the price, I expected something a little higher in quality. There are uneven gaps between the inset speed control and the motor&rsquo;s casing. Same for the oscillate toggle. The entire back grill is made of a cheap plastic that feels like it will crack if I ever remove the front grill to clean. Also, I&rsquo;ve been using this fan for ONE DAY, and it already squeaks when I set it on oscillate.I need a fan now, so I&rsquo;m not going to go through the trouble of returning this unit. But would I buy this again in the future? Not even at half the price.Pros: It was easy to assemble and the breeze it generates is reasonably strong, even on low. It&rsquo;s also one of the quieter fans I&rsquo;ve owned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="in-addition-to-the-issue-of-bad-plastic-material">In addition to the issue of bad plastic material</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this fan in the first week of May to prepare for summer in Texas. Today (06/29/2016), after about 7 weeks, the fan is broken as shown in the picture. We only used this fan in the lunch and dinner time around the dining table, not running the whole day. In addition to the issue of bad plastic material, the fan is very noisy, even at the medium level of wind. I would definitely not recommend this product for anyone here!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-not-recommend-this-or-any-other-holmes-products-due-to-this">I would not recommend this or any other Holmes products due to this &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased just over 1 year ago, only use during summer season, so as you can see did not use 1 full year and the fan has now stopped working on high and barely runs on low or medium speed. Also after running the fan for a few days the blades fell off and we had to take it complete apart and put back together following the instructions once again. Cannot return as it was purchased over 1 year ago, what a shame. I would not recommend this or any other Holmes products due to this not lasting 1 year. I will ensure I tell everyone I know about this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-not-the-fan-for-me">this is not the fan for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked one day. Why did they use soft plastic to hold fan blades on crazy. I went to sleep and in the morning the fan blades had came off and the middle plastic thing was broke. Lucky for me they just stopped spinning and did not contact the blade guard. Would return it but the thing is big and came in like 8 pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-first-one-i-bought-because-i-liked-the-style">The first one I bought because I liked the style</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan is worthless.The first one I bought because I liked the style.Within one day the plastic nut assembly holding the fan blade broke,it seemed to be from the stress of the rotating fan.Amazon quickly replaced the item for me,the second fan lasted one week before the exact same thing occurred.This is more than a factory defect and engineering defect.I have an old fan that lasted many many years and used the nut off it&rsquo;s fan blade to hold blade on this new one until replacement arrived.Now I&rsquo;m throwing this away and will not buy this brand ever again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loved-it-in-the-beginning">Loved it in the beginning</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Loved it in the beginning.. bought in 2015, then the blades got slower and slower until they wont spin anymore even with help. We maintained it kept it clean etc..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lasts-for-years">Lasts for years</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems like this fan is discontinued, but I bought it in 2010 and it is still working perfectly and silently seven years later, and astonishingly after three moves, including one&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality">Poor Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The nut holding the fan blade broke the first time I used it.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Great air flow for this California heat! Easy to put together and seems very well made. Would purchase again!</p>

<p>bought another great fan</p>

<h5 id="broke-after-4-months">Broke after 4 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have an older version (its at least 10 years old) of the exact Holmes 16&rdquo; fan that I love so I decided to buy a second one for a different room.</p>
