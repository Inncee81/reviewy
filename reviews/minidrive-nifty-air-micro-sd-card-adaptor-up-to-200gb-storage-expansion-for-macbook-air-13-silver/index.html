<p>Product Description
As keen MacBook users, we love their design, portability, and super fast flash storage; but we were always running out of space due to all the photos, videos, dropbox files and other stuff that seem to continually fill our computers. The Nifty MiniDrive was designed to solve that problem in the easiest way possible - a plug and play, seamless storage upgrade.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

<p>Upgrade Your Storage (The Easy Way)
Adding storage space to a MacBook shouldn&rsquo;t be complicated, but it can be. The MiniDrive is our solution. It&rsquo;s simple to use, non-destructive and lets you add up to 200GB of extra space. It also weighs next-to-nothing, fits snugly into your MacBook&rsquo;s SD card slot and is pretty much invisible once plugged in.</p>

<p>Plug &amp; Play. Job Done.
No extra software required. Just insert the MiniDrive into the SD card slot of your MacBook and watch it appear on your desktop. Designed as a semi-permanent storage solution, it has no additional cables or parts protruding from the slot, it can remain in there wherever you go, without being in your way.</p>

<p>Engineered to be Beautiful
Precision-machined &amp; hand-polished from aircraft grade aluminium. Every MiniDrive is designed to be as close to seamless.</p>

<p>Backup in the Background
The MiniDrive integrates with your MacBook&rsquo;s native Time Machine for a set-and-forget critical backup experience.</p>

<p>Easy to Install, Easy to Remove
Need access to your SD card slot for a bit? No problem. Flush fitting, but removable with the flick of a finger.</p>

<p>Technology designed around living.
At Nifty, we believe that technology should be something as understated as it is useful. It should fit into your life in such a way that you don&rsquo;t want to leave home without it, but should not demand attention or recognition. It is there to help you do what you do best, nothing more.</p>

<p>About the Startup</p>

<p>Describe your product in 3 words.</p>

<p>Storage made Simple</p>

<p>How did you come up with the idea for this product?</p>

<p>It all started with the MacBook Air. We wanted to create an easy way to add memory to the MacBook Air, without having to rip it open with a torx screwdriver. The easiest way to do that, of course, is to use an external hard disk drive, but as that is not really integrated with the computer we thought we could do better. The MiniDrive was our solution: using the SD card slot in the 13&rdquo; MacBook Air. While a normal SD card, sticks out by about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; from the body of the computer when fully inserted, the MiniDrive was created to sit completely flush with the body of the MacBook, becoming a semi-permanent part of your computer.</p>

<p>What makes your product special?</p>

<p>Unlike other solutions, the Nifty MiniDrive works with any microSD card up to 2TB, allowing it to be easily and quickly upgraded as bigger and better microSD cards come onto the market. One of the cool things about microSD cards is that they are practically indestructible - in fact, a major manufacturer of them claims their cards can survive under the sea for over 24 hours, withstand 1.6 tons of force, and are impervious to magnets and X-rays. Therefore, when combined with the Nifty MiniDrive, this makes them perfectly suited for both daily data and back-up. As the MiniDrives are designed to stay in your computer without getting in the way, a daily back-up of your critical files may be set up and then happen automatically without having to remember to plug anything in. Then if you happen to spill coffee on your computer or drop it down the stairs, or some other disaster strikes you will not be forced to re-do days, weeks or even months worth of work, or even worse lose memories in the form of photos or videos that may be irreplaceable.</p>

<p>What has been the best part of your startup experience?</p>

<p>Sitting on a train, or airplane, or cafe, and seeing someone with a Nifty MiniDrive in their computer. Just seeing someone you don&rsquo;t know, using your product and it making a difference to their life&hellip;there is nothing quite like that feeling of gratitude and pride.</p>

<h5 id="must-add-accessory">Must add accessory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have two of these now with my two Macbook Pro Retina 15&rdquo;. Pair this up with the SanDisk 200 GB micro SD to maximize the space you can add to your macbook. I use this as a time machine but have also utilized it as extra space for my backup macbook.The build quality is excellent and it looks as if it fits the macbook as an OEM attachment. The price increased about $10 on my second purchase but at $40 it is still worth it to add more space to your macbook.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-have">A Must have &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I paired this with a 128GB High Speed MicroSDXC card and it&rsquo;s just a great way to expand your storage &hellip; the Nifty Drive always seems to be discovered and ready to go &hellip;and the transfer to and from the sdCard is great for What I use it for Pics,Music,Photos,and File Storage&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="flexible-semi-permanent-storage-for-your-macbook-pro">Flexible, semi-permanent storage for your MacBook Pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For anyone looking to expand their storage on their unibody MacBook Pro, the MiniDrive is is worth consideration. I was impressed with the precision machining of the MiniDrive: its alignment and colour is matched perfectly with the MacBook Pro chassis. Leaving SD cards hanging out the slot often risked disconnection I found; the microSD card attached via the MiniDrive has stayed connected without issue so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-product-so-far-have-had-it-for">Very happy with this product so far (have had it for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nifty card almost doubled the storage available to my on my MacBook Air and it just worked without requiring tech gymnastics. I&rsquo;m able to back up the card&rsquo;s contents via Time Machine, also without any problems. Very happy with this product so far (have had it for about 3 months).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-very-well">Works very well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works just as you&rsquo;d think. No problems whatsoever. Fits flush next to MacBook Air and does not wobble. If you plan on keeping it as permanent storage this shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, but it&rsquo;s a little hard to pull the microSD card back out from the adapter, but it comes out eventually. I would have given it 5 starts if it had been a little bit cheaper (there are other similar offerings that are cheaper, this is just the best looking/best functioning one) or if the silver part had been made out of aluminum (it&rsquo;s plastic, but looks just like the MacBook&rsquo;s aluminum).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works for what it advertised, however I had to buy both models to see which one would fit my mac as it&rsquo;s mid 2012 retina. Hope you can add more information so other customers can choose better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-way-to-offload-a-large-iphotos-library-from-your">A great way to offload a large iPhotos library from your &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits perfectly. A great way to offload a large iPhotos library from your SSD to free up space! The only downside is getting the thing out requires a paperclip, otherwise it always seems to tear up my fingernail.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-it-but-it-s-kind-of-superfluous">I like it but it&rsquo;s kind of superfluous.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice for people who care about that kind of &ldquo;detail&rdquo; (like I do). Kind of pricy but I liked it. Could have some kind of discount buying nifty mini drive and the micro sd together.. it would have been nice.</p>

<p>So helpful to have the extra storage&hellip; I&rsquo;m consistently at ~10gb free space on my MBP, so this gives me breathing room. If you have fingernails, you&rsquo;ll be able to get it out&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-be-fooled">Don&rsquo;t be fooled!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>DOES NOT STORE ANYTHING!!!! The description said it stores up to 200gb but it is simply a housing for a micro sd card. Don&rsquo;t buy it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fit-looks-sleek">Great fit, looks sleek.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic fit in the macbook retina. Does not protrude from the computer and can be used as a secondary hard drive for storage. Love it.</p>

<h5 id="must-have">Must Have</h5>

<p>This is the perfect tool for my MacBook Pro M-12&rsquo;. I combined a SanDisk 200GB SDXC card with this for a great Time Machine. This is not some purchase, but a wise investment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as easy as it says. You have to make a lot of effort to insert a micro SD card into the adaptor correctly. It&rsquo;s too tight. Then another surprise is coming&hellip;</p>
