<h5 id="0331-machine-gun-instructor-here-these-are-great">0331 Machine Gun instructor here. These are great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>USMC Machine Gun instructor checking in. We conduct a machine gun shoot once a month, firing 5.56, 7.62, 50 cal, and 40mm grenades. We routinely shoot over 15,000 rounds per machine gun range. I have had these muffs for the last 6 ranges and they are fantastic! They work as advertised and protect my hearing from full auto machine gun fire from less than 3 ft away. The batteries last a while (I keep the volume about half-way, which makes normal conversation sound normal.) I wear them for about 8 hrs. at a time and they are as comfortable as a $60 pair of muffs should ever be. They do not interfere with cheek weld or any shooting position I have used. Walkers Game Ear Razor Slim Electronic Muff should serve any shooter well if they are looking for cheap, reliable, sound amplifying ear pro. My pair has been going strong for literally hundreds of thousands of rounds. These are a solid deal and I recommend them to anyone who inquires about them.Pros:- Long battery life. Only requires two AAA batteries that are included and easy to change.- Fantastic hearing protection. I work with several people who have more expensive, &ldquo;tactical&rdquo; ear-pro (Pelters, etc.) that can&rsquo;t suppress the .50 cal report. These Walkers muffle all gunshots regardless of how loud they are or how close I am to them.- Conversations are distinct and easy to hear. I can hear radio traffic without having to remove ear pro. Big plus. I can even turn them up and hear conversations several hundred feet away! Great for big ranges.- They even have a standard headphone jack if you want to talk on your phone or plug up your iPod and mow the lawn or something.Cons:- The fit is good, but if you are talking or moving your jaw sometimes the seal will break and allow a gunshot sound to get through. This is minimal and could be due to the shape of my head and/or the position I wear them. If you sweat much this problem is compounded as the seal is now wet and easier to be disturbed. As I said this problem is minimal and not easily repeatable, doesn&rsquo;t detract from the rating for me.-They are not omni directional. It is difficult to tell where sound is coming from. The sound is clear and amplified, just deceiving in which direction it came from. For my particular job this is no big deal. If you need to know what direction the sound came from, these are not the hearing pro for you.-THEY DO FIT UNDER THE STANDARD ACH HELMET, but not well.( I wear a Medium) It is not designed to fit under this helmet (as far as I know) and the fact that they even do with minimal pad adjustment is really more of pro. If you don&rsquo;t wear a helmet when shooting, disregard, they fit great.-Thick eye pro frames will disrupt the ear seal if placed over the frame. If you put them on over your eye pro because you forgot to remove them, the pressure feels like Leonidas trying to drive his spear through your head. You will only do this once. I have some thin frames now but I just rest the frames on top of the ear muff. If I had to do rigorous movement, they might fall off, but they haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-ear-protection">Very good ear protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried these out at the rifle range last week and this product did not disappoint. I can clearly hear my buddy complain about how crappy his shots were but was not affected by the pops of the rifles. I was easily able turn the voice volume of the knob on the earpiece down so I didn&rsquo;t have to hear him whine.</p>

<h5 id="consider-these-over-the-howard-leight-earmuffs">Consider these over the Howard Leight Earmuffs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m comparing these directly to theÂ Howard Leight by Honeywell Impact Sport Sound Amplification Electronic Earmuff, Classic Green (R-01526).Wins for the Walker&rsquo;s:1. The control knob is easier to locate and operate while wearing the headset. That&rsquo;s not to say the Howard Leight set is difficult, just that the Walker&rsquo;s set has a larger, more pronounced knob.2. The AUX input has a built in cover and is in a slightly superior orientation (towards the bottom of the headset and recessed).3. The battery door is more obvious/easier to remove. Could be considered a negative, as the Howard Leight battery door has a more affirmative &ldquo;click&rdquo; when removing. I&rsquo;ve not had an issue with either.4. The headband is thicker and uses superior materials IMO. It uses a neoprene like material as opposed to a faux leather on the Howard Leight set.5. Thicker pads on the ear cups that seem to seal slightly better. I wear glasses and I prefer the fit of the Walker&rsquo;s. Tight and light (bowchickawowow).6. Built in mic has metal covers that are flush. The Howard Leight set has foam covers that protrude slightly.7.The way the Walker&rsquo;s modify incoming sound seems more subtle and natural. The Howard Leight set has a pronounced change in volume. The Walker&rsquo;s also produce less chirping, static, and interference sounds. The advantage in overall ear protection is negligible.8. The Walker&rsquo;s just look cooler by my taste. Angular and refined, hence the &ldquo;Razor&rdquo; name.9. This is anecdotal at best, but I feel I can just throw the Walker&rsquo;s on with less initial adjustment.Wins for the Howard Leight:1. Noticeably smaller profile while equipped and while folded up for storage. They fit well into a pocket or pack. The weight difference is negligible.2. The wires from the headband to the ear cups are thicker, shorter, and have superior protection at the connection points.3. The arms connecting the headband to the cups are ever so slightly beefier. Time will tell if that means stronger.4. More distinct omni directional reporting. The Walker&rsquo;s are more like natural ears in that both sides hear a sound regardless of direction, but the Howard Leight set makes it way more obvious what direction it actually came from. Walker&rsquo;s are more natural, Howard Leight are more modified.5. No giant grey brand logo on the headband. They just have a more subtle and traditional appearance. The Walker&rsquo;s are more aggressive stylistically.6. On most days they are $10 to $20 lower in price without feeling noticeably cheaper. Note: I paid less for the Walker&rsquo;s due to a sale.I&rsquo;m a marginally above average size male and have shared both sets with larger and smaller men as well as very small women. No one complained about either set, but I think the Walker&rsquo;s were more impressive to most. I believe it&rsquo;s very obvious that Walker&rsquo;s set out to match or exceed the Howard Leight earmuffs in all regards and were successful. If you&rsquo;re a range day tripper or hunter, I&rsquo;d recommend the Walker&rsquo;s.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-block-the-loud-sounds-as-well-as-i-expected">Does not block the loud sounds as well as I expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used the muffs for the first time yesterday at an indoor range.. While they allow for excellent hearing of voices and low level background noise, I found they did not block the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; noise as well as my older muffs. After a period of time I got used to the louder noise level but it could have been better.</p>

<h5 id="these-things-are-awesome">These things are AWESOME!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These things are AWESOME!!! Had I known they were sooo nice, I would have bought at least two pairs, years ago!!! They hold battery power just fine&hellip;haven&rsquo;t used them in several months, and I have already had them on for over an hour. I am using them right now, in my office, next to a flight line; as the Blue Angles fly around us! They are REALLY loud volume, if you want them to be! Or, they are VERY quite, with no sound turned on! With the volume off, it&rsquo;s almost like having ear buds (plugs), and regular headphones on! Yes, they&rsquo;re THAT good! It&rsquo;s rare I give anything 5 stars, but these are worth it!!!</p>

<h5 id="no-good-for-shooting-sports">no good for shooting sports</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought to replace the usual $20 cheap Winchester brand I usually buy and toss out after a year when the electronics begin to fail. Very disappointed that these from Walker don&rsquo;t seem to be sensitive enough to detect pistol fire and shut off. Also, the amplification seems very unnatural. I suspect the microphone placement, as it tends to pick up from angles you would not normally get with human hearing. Can be disorienting. I expected much better from this name brand. I find them not usable except in the turned off state.</p>

<p>Soooooo cool! I&rsquo;m not used to being able to hear clearly with ear Muff&rsquo;s on, so the adjustment takes time.</p>

<p>Much better in comfort and quiet level compared to Howard Leigh&hellip; I love the overhead band, so soft on top of my head</p>

<h5 id="fits-well-works-well">Fits well, works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. Worked just as designed. Doesnt muffle very well but the point of electronic protection is to keep you ears tense so that it does not need to muffle as much to work&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="takes-some-getting-used-to-great-product">Takes some getting used to, great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good noise cancellation but be warned, all sounds are filtered and will sound delayed. Maybe this is just me but I could hear the delay in the input of sounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stop-considering-options-and-get-these">Stop considering options and get these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these after wearing my old set in the rain and the electronics died. These are much better built, more comfortable, and the noise cancellation is better.</p>
