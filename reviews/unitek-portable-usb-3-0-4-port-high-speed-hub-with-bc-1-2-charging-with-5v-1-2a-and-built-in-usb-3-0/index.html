<h5 id="excellent-hub-for-a-low-price">Excellent hub for a low price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t figure out how to insert a picture (screen cap).With a USB hub, I look at two factors. For USB 3.0, I add a third.The first, durability, I have not been able to test. My review will reflect any lifespan issues that may arise over the next 36 months. The rating can drop from a 5, depending on if there are any issues as well as how they are handled by the maker.The second is ability. It accepts power through a mini usb port. I was able run four external spinny drives, simultaneously. Ability is great. It takes a second or two longer to recognize than I like, but that is a non-issue.The third (for 3.0 only) is speed. This is what I needed the screen cap for. I ran four ATTOs with a simultaneous staggered running for USB 3.0 (one is pseudo 3.0) thumb drives. The upper end speeds (132, 132, 45, and 149 mb/s) are on par with running them directly from the PC. I am very pleased. This outperforms the hub that cost me twice as much. I imagine I would get reduced performance testing it with external SSDs, but that goes beyond my needs.I found the picture button! I feel dumb now!I hope the endurance holds up. At present, I would not only recommend, but HIGHLY recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-great-price">Great Product. Great Price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this USB hub for more than 15 days and here is my opinion about it.I bought this product to use it with my laptop which has only 2 USB ports. One is dedicated to my wireless mouse so I was left with just one. I wanted to use this one port to connect to my external HDD, my wireless keyboard and also sometimes charge my phone (my laptop has a fast charging usb port) all at once. So I short listed Anker&rsquo;s $10 usb hub for it&rsquo;s sleek and minimal design. But, then I read the reviews which said that I cannot charge my phone while using the HDD, heck I cannot even use 2 external HDDs at once.Then this product caught my eye. It does all I wanted it to do while remaining under 10 bucks. It has a dedicated micro USB port for that extra juice if required. Although I haven&rsquo;t used it yet, but it is good to know it is there when or if I need it.It has a small and compact form factor with a solid albeit plastic build. Again, for the price, I&rsquo;m not complaining. It has a subtle white LED that doesn&rsquo;t blind. All the USB ports feel solid. Now, I have read few reviews complaining that using both an external mouse/keyboard and an external HDD causes some lag in mouse/keyboard input, I have done some tests while transfering some files and found no such issues, yet (PS I used the non fast charging port of my laptop). Speaking of tranfering files, I&rsquo;m happy to report the speeds are consistent and the same using my Transcend 1TB external HDD with USB 3.0.In conclusion, as long as you don&rsquo;t throw it around like a tennis ball, I&rsquo;m pretty sure this USB hub will hang around for quite a while.</p>

<h5 id="different-product-design-same-or-better-performance">Different product/design, same or better performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually the image of the product it is not what I received (that&rsquo;s why i deducted one star)!I am attaching two pictures from the manufacturer&rsquo;s website (Y-3061) with what I actually received.I&rsquo;d say the version I have received it has some advantages over the ones listed on amazon&rsquo;s page:- aluminum case like (nice looking, smooth surface, elegant);- very portable with option to tuck the USB cable in the hub;disadvantages:- short USB cable; (I think that cable it is not longer than 5&rdquo; - do not know about the pictured one)- all USB ports are on the side, the one in the head of the device was moved&hellip;I got this because my PC case (mid tower) does not have front USB3, only in the back, so now I have USB ports on the top of the case where I have easier access :) Tested with a 128GB and a 64Gb USB3 sticks and performance was as expected with ATTO disk benchmark while having both sticks plugged at the same time. I also tested with a BT receiver, wireless keyboard receiver and it worked properly.I bought this product with my own money and I was not provided with a free or a discounted sample&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="short-cord">short cord</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cord is shorter than I expected or needed. The pictures all give the impression that is longer than it is (maybe about 12&rdquo;). I went back after the fact to look for information to see if I had the right to be disgruntled, but I can&rsquo;t see anywhere where the length of the cord is mentioned one way or the other. I haven&rsquo;t used the actual device yet, because I had to order an extension cord before I could use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="acts-as-otg-charger">Acts as OTG charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Something is not right with this hub. Not sure if it&rsquo;s me or the hub. This was to replace a similar ORICO 4-port hub that broke due to spouse force jamming a cable into one port backwards. Duh!!!! This hub seems to be acting like just an OTG charging station rather than a data transfer hub. Plug this into Win10 PC and it&rsquo;s not even being recognized, or any devices plugged into it afterwards. Power is going to the devices, like cell phone, and is charging. That&rsquo;s all though. I&rsquo;ve since found and re-ordered another ORICO to replace this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mircousb-for-external-power-instead-of-proprietary-power-supply-hi-five">Mircousb for external power instead of proprietary power supply. Hi five!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this guy because the price was really good, and it has a mircousb that you can use to add external power to it. That is fantastic because most powered usbs have their own proprietary power supply, so a microusb is a very welcomed change. My only con is that the cable is a bit short. But that is only a con if you are looking for something with a long cable. Overall, this thing is most excellent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-it-for-external-drives">Don&rsquo;t buy it for external drives</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It would not work with two different 2.5&rdquo; external drives. I tried two separate USB chargers to supply power, one rated at 5V 2.5A. Both drives work fine plugged directly into the laptop. They also work fine through a different hub on the same laptop without needing additional power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="got-replacment-and-that-failed-now-as-well-unreliable">Got replacment&hellip;And that failed now as well. Unreliable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Most Updated:So the replacement has now failed. Will work if 1 usb device is plugged in but if another one is plugged in when the computer is on the computer freezes until one of the usb devices is unplugged.UPDATE: Company told me they would send a replacement Almost 30 days later and still no replacement. Very disappointed :(Worked fine at first. A few months later 2 ports slowed down to usb2 speeds. Few months more and all ports are down to usb2 or WORSE speeds.</p>
