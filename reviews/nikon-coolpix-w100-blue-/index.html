<h5 id="not-waterproof-in-my-experience">Not Waterproof in my experience</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is NOT waterproof. Well, maybe if you drop it in a puddle. I took it snorkeling and within the first 20 minutes, it clouded up, got condensation, and was essentially useless. So very disappointed. I tested it out on land first, and the pictures were good as a regular camera, and I liked the wifi feature where the photos automatically sent to your phone. But I bought it for snorkeling. I stay on the surface and don&rsquo;t venture down from the surface ever, so extremely disappointed that I basically now have a ruined camera after only a couple of uses.</p>

<h5 id="decent-camera-for-a-decent-price">decent camera for a decent price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have used it a few times - takes decent pictures - easy to navigate</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="water-damage-not-covered-under-warranty">Water damage not covered under warranty!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this Nikon camera, used it one time at a local water park and there was condensation behind the viewing screen. The camera went under the water 5 times for a picture and then back out, so I wouldn&rsquo;t say this had excessive exposure to the water. We turned it into Nikon to see if we could get it repaired. We received the item back with notification that it could not be repaired as Nikon does not cover water damage under its warranty for this camera. This is a water camera and they wouldn&rsquo;t cover water damage??? We were able to return it to the store where we had purchased the camera from but I will not be purchasing another water camera from Nikon. The photos that we did get, were just okay. Not typical for a Nikon product in my experience. I have purchased 3 other Nikon cameras and have loved every one of them except this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="died-first-time-under-water">Died first time under water.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed in this camera. I purchased this for its underwater properties, as we were headed for a trip to the Great Barrier Reef, and had a limited budget for a camera. I tried it out on land to get used to how the camera works and was quite satisfied for what it is. However, even though I followed all underwater instructions to a T, it died after 30 minutes in the water (near the surface while snorkeling) on it&rsquo;s maiden voyage. It was working fine, then suddenly stopped working and wouldn&rsquo;t turn on again. Eventually there was some condensation noted on the inside of the lens, and after following all instructions, I opened it up to dry. The only noticeable water inside was two drops on the battery, and condensation on the lens and viewer. I have not been able to resurrect it. Thankfully, there does not appear to be any damage to my SD card, so at least that has lived to capture another day (in another camera).</p>

<p>Great pictures and and videos under water. Above water video are average.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-a-casual-traveling-photographer">Perfect for a casual traveling photographer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second one of these that I have bought for my wife. (Left the first in a Hotel).She loves the thing. It&rsquo;s easier to use and takes better pictures and videos than her iphone7 It takes nice underwater pictures, too. This is a well designed product. I use expensive Nikon stuff (like a D750) for a reference to where my viewpoint comes from.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="save-yourself-the-heartache">Save yourself the heartache.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Popped open the first time I was using it underwater and destroyed the SIM card so I lost all my photos. Extremely poorly designed. I have owned many Nikon cameras over the years and have been very loyal to the brand, which is why I decided to go with this camera as an easy point and shoot and underwater camera for a once in a lifetime camping trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park. To call this experience disappointing would be a gross understatement. Even devastating doesn&rsquo;t quite describe it. I expected far, far better from Nikon. Save yourself the heartache and do not buy this camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing">Disappointing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Takes decent enough pictures, even underwater. I bought it mostly for the transfer to phone feature, unfortunately this works sporadically and requires immense amounts of time to use, as everything has to be reset every time I transfer pictures.</p>
