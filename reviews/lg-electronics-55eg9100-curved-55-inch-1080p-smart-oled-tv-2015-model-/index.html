<h5 id="oled-vs-4k">OLED vs 4K</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One question that seems to echo repeatedly is &ldquo;Why would I ever want to spend more money on a 1080p TV than a top of the line 4K set?&ldquo;And its a great question, really. After all, everything most consumers hear - from advertisers, sales people, friends, and family alike would suggest that the incredible amount of detail picked up by those 6 million extra pixels is the way to go in 2016. How could so many people be wrong about something as obvious as picture quality?Firstly, everything you see in a retail environment is perfect in benefiting the brightest screen in the room. So, compared to some of the high end 4K models like the Samsung S8500, OLED just doesnt seem to have the same &lsquo;pop&rsquo;. Back when plasma TVs were popular, some retailers addressed this by keeping their TVs in a dark area of the store to emulate what you might be getting at home. But that still doesn&rsquo;t address the issue at hand - resolution IS what matters, right? Isn&rsquo;t that why we all switched to 1080p?Yes and no. Because of that switch, we began to see what was once perceived as an incredible amount of detail in our TVs, and benefit now from a clear, clean picture in a much larger size range. And while the same can be said about 4K&rsquo;s promise, it won&rsquo;t make a noticeable difference at home unless you&rsquo;re either sitting within 4 feet of your TV or you&rsquo;re buying something over 90&rdquo;, and even then it won&rsquo;t make an incredible argument for itself until 2160p is standardized through all programming. So, ask yourself these questions - &ldquo;When I saw a 4K TV in a store, how close was I standing? When I stand further away, am I noticing more details, or just a cleaner picture with much improved depth and vibrancy?&ldquo;The remarkable thing about OLED TVs is that they actually produce more depth through their infinite contrast when compared to even the best 4K TVs, and they highlight the detail in everything you&rsquo;ll ever watch in HD. Even if 4K does become the new standard someday, from where you normally sit, you won&rsquo;t actually notice more detail. As of this writing, most of the content you watch - being that its 1080p - has a decent chance of looking worse on a 4K display, because the upscaling process tends to leave small artifacts, or confused sections of screen fluttering about. This can even cause some serious motion blur, whereas the LG 9100 has been praised for producing virtually none whatsoever.Buying a TV is like buying a car for a lot of people. Ever notice that when people spend a lot of money on a new car they go on and on about how it&rsquo;s such a great vehicle? TVs work in that same way. If your friend drops a solid amount of cash on a brand new 4K TV, it&rsquo;s suddenly the best TV you could ever own. And while it may be a clearer picture than their old TV, LED TVs have gotten much cleaner over the last 3 years, so it would be odd if it didn&rsquo;t look noticeably better than what they had before regardless of the resolution.Knowing all of this and a lot more, I confidently bought this OLED. I&rsquo;ll admit, I was still somewhat concerned with whether it would look as good as my buddy&rsquo;s Samsung 8500, or even my brothers 7100, being that when I saw the two TVs in their respective homes, I thought the quality was fantastic on both sets. The OLED, however, is a beast of an entirely different species. The first thing I did after setting it up was test out 5 unique type of content - vibrant 2D and 3D (Mad Max), dark 2D and 3D (Gravity), video games (Madden and Fallout 4), cable TV, and sports. If I were even the least bit underwhelmed or disappointed, I would have taken this TV back within a day or two and saved some money getting the 8500. I was not only reassured by the quality, I had actually set my own expectations lower than what the TV actually produced.If youre a videophile, and you want the best TV available on the market, you will not be disappointed by the LG 9100.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I received my 55EG9100 yesterday and while it looks significantly better than the 8 year old Samsung it replaced, it doesn&rsquo;t blow my mind away like so many reviews suggest. I&rsquo;ll admit that I haven&rsquo;t delved incredibly deep into the video settings, but the picture looks as good to me as the high-end 4k sets available at the big box stores. For reference our sofa is ~10 feet away from the TV so 4k, according to the experts, would have no visible difference at that distance.A few things of note that I feel aren&rsquo;t mentioned in any other review online:1) The mounting options are not as limited as LG would have you think as there are still 4 screw holes available to attach arm brackets to (see attached pictures). The curve did not influence the way these brackets attached to the plate on the wall. The screw size I used is M6x20 and they threaded just fine and screwed all the way in. The arms do sit a bit close to each other, but with the weight of this TV it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.2) I was surprised to see that this TV can convert any 2D signal to 3D and it works surprisingly well.3) The viewing angle on this TV is amazing. You can be standing next to it and still get a great picture. I also noticed that the curve does reduce canned light reflections, but with it&rsquo;s glossy screen it does pick up quite a bit of natural light so do your best to avoid putting the TV directly across from a window.***UpdateAs of 6/20/16 - Plex is now available on WebOS 2 and it works really well.</p>

<h5 id="nearly-perfect-non-4k-tv-replaced-a-plasma">Nearly perfect non-4K tv (replaced a plasma)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was bought to replace a Samsung F5300 plasma that started to go bad (motherboard) after only 3 years of use. Coming from the plasma, having true black was a big deal for us, so a standard LED wasn&rsquo;t an option. This being the entry-level-price OLED, we opted for this model rather than the 4K version.The colors are more intense (saturated) on the 9100 than they were on the plasma, which took a bit of getting used to&hellip; almost a Crayola effect. Tweaking the OLED Light setting from the default 80 down to 76 helps with that.The one quibble I have with this set is the sound; specifically that there&rsquo;s no option for making sure the commercials aren&rsquo;t louder than the normal program content (TruVolume/Dolby Volume/Dynamic Volume.) I was surprised that this feature doesn&rsquo;t exist, because we had it on the &lsquo;ancient&rsquo; 2003 rear projection Hitachi and also on the 2013 Samsung plasma. As a result, we&rsquo;re constantly adjusting the volume a notch down for most commercials and then back up again when the program content returns. The Advanced sound control called &ldquo;Automatic Volume Control&rdquo; sounds (no pun intended) like it should do this but only kicks in when a fairly significant volume difference occurs when changing between television stations&hellip; not between commercial/program content broadcast on a single station. I suspect that the volume spike isn&rsquo;t big enough between commercial and main content to trigger the leveling system (or maybe it simply doesn&rsquo;t work as well as the system that was on the other tvs we had, LOL)</p>

<h5 id="great-except-for-the-dead-pixel-in-the-first-2-weeks">Great except for the dead pixel in the first 2 weeks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this display for its elegant curve, thinness and almost bezel-free front. The problem is I have only used it for 2 weeks and I already have a dead pixel!! As I got this from Amazon Warehouse deals there is no replacement available other than other Warehouse deals. LG is sending a tech out and I still have a week to send it back to Amazon so we shall see what happens with the tech, either they replace the display, the tv or whatever I&rsquo;ll send it back to Amazon if I have to.Edit: LG is going to replace the display so all is good :-)&hellip;hopefully lol.Well LG came and replaced the display and now I have a beautiful new display with no dead pixel! This tv was easy to mount on my old tv mount, no need for the special LG mount in my opinion.</p>

<p>This set has been a joy to live with. Really if 1080p is all you need then this will fill the bill. We use Roku and wifi for tv needs and this set has never disappointed.</p>

<p>For the price, this is a solid deal.There are a couple of buyer beware aspects:1. Be aware that this is a 2015 device.</p>

<p>The picture quality is unbelievable . I returned 5 TVs before I picked this one . I am in love with it . The UX is very intuitive and decently fast .</p>
