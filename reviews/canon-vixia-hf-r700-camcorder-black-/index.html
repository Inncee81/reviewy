<p>SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization</p>

<p>Click here for larger image
Canon&rsquo;s sophisticated SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer corrects camera shake quickly, so even handheld video taken at long focal lengths is sharp and steady. Providing continuous adjustment throughout the entire zoom range to correct a broad range of motion, with extra compensation applied at wide-angle focal lengths, the Dynamic Image Stabilization system on the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder stabilizes rotational camera shake. Controlling rotational camera shake – horizontal, vertical and roll axis – helps ensure smooth, virtually distortion-free video, even when you&rsquo;re walking while shooting.</p>

<p>Canon 3.28 Megapixel Full HD CMOS Image Sensor</p>

<p>The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder is equipped with a 3.28 Megapixel Full HD CMOS Image Sensor to capture your memories in true 1920 x 1080 resolution. Canon&rsquo;s advanced, high-resolution HD CMOS Image Sensor features extra sensitivity that delivers beautifully lifelike Full HD video with natural color, even in low light. On-chip noise reduction brings bright clarity to every frame. Video is rich, clear and amazingly detailed anywhere you view it, even when played back on a large HDTV.</p>

<p>DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor captures video at 1920 x 1080 resolution and helps provide outstanding imaging performance</p>

<p>The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder incorporates the powerful DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor for outstanding imaging performance. The DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor captures more light, for brighter, virtually noise-free images even in dark scenes. Dramatically increased processing power lets you record in both AVCHD and easy-to-share MP4 formats simultaneously with the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder&rsquo;s Dual Recording. It also enables built-in transcoding from AVCHD to MP4.</p>

<p>Record Full HD video directly to a removable SD memory card
The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder records Full HD video directly to a removable SD memory card. Widely available in several capacities, SD memory cards let you share your videos quickly and easily. In addition to SD memory cards, the VIXIA HF R700 also lets you use super-high capacity SDXC cards.

When AVCHD/MP4 recording has continued for approximately 12 hours, it will automatically stop and then start.
1080/60p recording in MP4 (35 Mbps) and AVCHD Progressive (28 Mbps) helps ensure high-quality capture of moving subjects
The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder gives you high-quality recording whether you&rsquo;re capturing MP4 or AVCHD files. 1080/60p recording captures twice the amount of information as 60i, and with images captured at a rate of up to 60 frames per second, diagonal noise is virtually eliminated so even fast-moving subjects show up crisply with motion and patterns clearly recorded. This greater sense of detail and faithful rendering of moving edges, plus enhanced color and fine tonal gradation, helps you take advantage of all that Full HD has to offer. AVCHD Progressive records at a bit rate of up to 28 Mbps, which is the highest in the AVCHD standard, and MP4 files are captured at a bit rate of up to 35 Mbps, so regardless of the format you&rsquo;re shooting or viewing, image quality is incredibly high.</p>

<p>3.0-inch capacitive touch panel LCD with increased brightness and new User Interface for easy menu navigation and simple viewing of videos
The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder features a new 3.0-inch capacitive touch panel LCD screen that&rsquo;s bright and clearly visible, even outdoors in the sun, with rich, natural color reproduction. Simply open the panel and the power is on. A gentle touch activates intuitive functions via large, easy-to-use icons in a streamlined new layout. Choose a focal point, track moving subjects, control exposure for selected areas and operate camcorder controls from the screen, all with a simple touch. The easy new user interface makes navigating menus, shooting and watching your videos easy and fun. Clear explanations for key settings pop up when selecting shooting modes and recording formats, so even new videographers can feel confident as they create impressive videos.</p>

<p>Advanced Baby Mode selects the optimal camcorder settings to help capture your baby&rsquo;s daily growth with ease
A convenient solution for capturing, tracking, organizing and sharing every precious moment of your baby&rsquo;s development, Baby Mode on the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder allows you to follow the growth of up to three children. A custom control button on the shooting screen activates the mode, and suitable settings for the shooting conditions, including Intelligent IS and more, are automatically selected. Simply pick up the camcorder and start recording, knowing capture will be of high quality. Videos shot in Baby Mode are automatically saved into a dedicated Baby Album so they won&rsquo;t get lost among your other videos. You can then view the Baby Album chronologically for a seamless way to relive and share your baby&rsquo;s growth with friends and relatives.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re shooting in Baby Mode, the camcorder&rsquo;s Pre-Record (Pre REC) function is always on. This places the camcorder in a stand-by &ldquo;pre-roll&rdquo; mode, where it continuously records three seconds of video to memory before you even press the record button. When you start recording, the additional video is recorded too, so it&rsquo;s easy to capture the baby&rsquo;s &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; and other special moments.</p>

<p>Touch Decoration in Baby Mode includes stamps to mark each video with your baby&rsquo;s current height and weight. And with a single registration of the baby&rsquo;s birth date, the camcorder will automatically calculate the number of days old and stamp videos accordingly, creating a diary of developmental milestones for years to come. Thanks to the number of decorations available on the VIXIA HF R700, it&rsquo;s easy to make a fun video commemorating your baby&rsquo;s special moments. The camcorder&rsquo;s other Touch Decoration options, including your own drawings, captions, animations and more, are fully available in Baby Mode, and all can easily be appended to previously shot video as well.</p>

<p>High-capacity BP-727 battery pack helps facilitate extended shooting time so you can capture important moments
The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder is powered by a high capacity Battery Pack BP-727. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery not only lets you shoot for long periods, but features intelligent technology that accurately indicates remaining battery time for extra insurance that you won&rsquo;t miss an important shooting opportunity.</p>

<p>Zoom Framing Assist setting is available in Auto or Manual mode, making it easier to accurately track and capture subjects while they are moving
The versatile 57x zoom on the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder is indispensable for shooting long distance subjects without intruding onto the scene or interrupting the action. But sometimes it can be tricky to keep such a distant subject in the frame. That&rsquo;s where Zoom Framing Assist comes in. When you&rsquo;re shooting at the long end of the zoom and you&rsquo;ve lost your subject, simply press an icon on the touch screen and the zoom magnification will automatically decrease, making it easy for you to locate the subject and zoom in on it again. Now available in Auto or Manual mode, Zoom Framing Assist helps keep your subject in the frame.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS automatically chooses from four different modes to help optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition
Intelligent IS makes it easy to shoot clear, sharply focused video, even in situations that typically cause camera shake. The Intelligent IS system analyzes the shooting situation for you, then automatically switches to the image stabilization method ideal for producing sharp, steady video. Four IS systems cover the gamut of shooting situations. Dynamic IS corrects minor movement and the shaking caused by walking while shooting. Macro IS delivers incredibly steady close-up shots. Powered IS comes into play when you&rsquo;re using the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder&rsquo;s powerful zoom, correcting shake that can occur in telephoto shots. Tripod Mode stops IS when the camcorder is stationary.</p>

<p>Audio Scene Select allows easy operation and setup for outstanding audio
Audio Scene Select on the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder allows you to easily capture clear, high-quality audio with a choice of five audio modes to choose from based on your shooting situation: Standard, Music, Speech, Forest and Birds and Noise Suppression. Each of these modes has pre-determined optimized settings ideal for the shot you&rsquo;re capturing, resulting in outstanding video with realistic, immersive audio. Audio settings can also be custom set to meet your shooting needs.</p>

<p>Smart AUTO helps make shooting great videos easy by intelligently selecting the proper settings for the camcorder
Smart AUTO lets you capture clear, bright, well-focused video while the camcorder takes care of the details. The system recognizes 38 shooting situations based on numerous factors, then automatically chooses the optimal settings for the situation. When you shoot a nearby subject in telephoto zoom mode, Auto Tele Macro gives your video the high-end artistic effect of a well-focused subject against a beautifully blurred background.</p>

<p>Slow &amp; Fast Motion recording allows you to record fast motion at up to 1200x and slow motion at 0.5x
You&rsquo;ll have fun using the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder&rsquo;s Slow &amp; Fast Motion capabilities. You can record slow motion images at speeds down to 0.5x – a great feature for checking out your tennis swing, or creating videos with cinema-like expression. Fast motion now tops out at an amazing 1200x (recording 20 hours of action as a 1-minute scene), for eye-popping action movie-like effects.</p>

<p>Five Cinema-Look Filter effects give video a cinematic feel and can be applied during or after shooting for your convenience
The VIXIA HF R700 camcorder allows you to create cinematic looks with the use of Cinema-Look Filters. This feature offers a choice of seven varied built-in adjustable filters, which give the look of a variety of cinematic styles by compensating for the color, gamma and other aspects of the image&rsquo;s quality. The looks can be previewed in the LCD display while shooting, and also applied post-capture for additional convenience and versatility. Choose from:</p>

<p>Cinema Standard Recreates the warm tones and muted highlights of classic film
Vivid   Accentuates primary colors for a bright, cheerful look
Cool    Adds a bluish tint for cool, futuristic-looking scenes
Sepia   Applies a sepia tint for an antique, faded look
Old Movies  Gives video the aged look of old cinema
Highlight Priority Mode helps to deliver an expansive range of colors and tones virtually consistent with how they&rsquo;re seen by the naked eye
To capture highly saturated, realistic colors and to convey gradation characteristics as perceived by the eye, the VIXIA HF R700 camcorder has a new Highlight Priority mode that achieves effects similar to HDR modes in other camcorders. By reducing the mid- to high-brightness compression of the standard gamma mode, the Highlight Priority mode helps to prevent loss of detail in high brightness areas. Designed for display on a bright LCD TV, videos captured in Highlight Priority mode should be shown at a high brightness setting to help ensure accurate portrayal of the effect.</p>

<h5 id="an-excellent-dedicated-video-camera">An Excellent Dedicated Video Camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATED 9/12/2016Great dedicated video camera! It&rsquo;s incredibly small, but not too small for my man hands. With the battery attached it has a good weight to it and doesn&rsquo;t feel cheap at all. It&rsquo;s taken a bit of time for me to get the camera setup to perform exactly as I want it to. A lot of trial and error, and fudging around with the different settings and presets, but I&rsquo;ve ultimately decided to keep this camera on it&rsquo;s very robust Full Auto mode with a few advanced settings changed in the settings menu. I&rsquo;ll pass these tips along to you below.Tips:&gt; Turn off &ldquo;Auto Slow Shutter&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve found that with this on the camera will slow the shutter speed in dark scenes to compensate for the low light, however this drops the frame rate and causes the recording to look jittery and choppy. It works great with this turned off, even in low light situations.&gt; Turn off &ldquo;Power on using LCD panel&rdquo;, If you turn this off you can continue recording even if you close the display, and even start/stop zoom in/out recordings without even opening the display at all.&gt; Changing the zoom type to 57X will give you a slightly wider field of view than 32X (default), however this will disable Dynamic Image Stabilization, leaving you with Standard IS. If you want the wider FOV then it&rsquo;s a trade off.&gt; Turn on &ldquo;LCD Mirror Image&rdquo; this will mirror the LCD&rsquo;s image when it&rsquo;s flipped for selfies so your framing and movement feels natural to you.&gt; Plug in any set of headphones to get a real-time monitor of the audio you&rsquo;re capturing. Even without hitting the record button you&rsquo;ll be able to hear exactly what the camera is hearing. This also works for watching &amp; listening to video stored on the sd card.Pros:+ 1080p 60FPS video is buttery smooth with no frame dips or choppy segments.+ The lens has front threads for attaching filters and additional lenses.+ Video quality is top notch in decent lighting conditions, and acceptable in low light conditions.+ Image stabilization works great for handheld, there are 3 different types of IS for your situation.+ Best full auto mode I&rsquo;ve ever seen, it even tells you what it&rsquo;s doing as it&rsquo;s doing it. (displays IS mode when it changes for different situations, and what type of scene it&rsquo;s adjusting for)+ You can remove the battery and run the camera completely off the wall charger to record for days uninterrupted.+ If you run out of battery power mid shot the camera will still save your video and not corrupt the file.+ The built in microphone is pretty great, it records in stereo and does an ok job at boosting the gain to appropriate levels. I believe it uses AGC or some form of dynamic compression. It even has different audio modes for things like speech, nature, or noise reduction. And if you don&rsquo;t like the mic, you can always plug in your own.+ It’s not talked about much, but this is actually a VERY nice time-lapse camera as well. It has built in functions for capturing custom speed time-lapse video that saves hours on battery life and SD card storage space.+ I&rsquo;ve connected a dynamic cardioid microphone and studio headphones to this camera at the same time and it worked exceptionally well. There must be a pretty good microphone preamp on this camera because I could monitor my voice in real-time crisp and clear in the headphones. However, if you plug a mono source mic into this camera, you’ll only get audio and monitor feedback out of one headphone ear cup. You’ll have to fix this in post production, or purchase a mono-in to stereo-out adapter to fill both L&amp;R audio channels.Cons:- Sometimes on rare occasions after recording a video longer than 10 minutes, or recording multiple short videos in quick succession, my VIXIA will start overexposing frames randomly and mix those into the recording that appear during playback as bright white flashes every 5-10 seconds. This is often accompanied by several underexposed frames that appear as dark blinks during playback. I’ve reported this to Canon support, but all they suggested was trying another SD card, or sending the camera in for warranty repairs. I haven’t made up my mind what I want to do about it if anything, but I’m curious if any other VIXIA owners have had a similar problem.- The tripod mounting threads are plastic and can be stripped if you&rsquo;re not careful.- Nowhere to mount a light or external shotgun microphone, the camera is so small it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense anyway.- The face detection feature can cause more problems than it solves, often times making the entire scene uncontrollably pulse in and out of focus while shooting indoors.- No external battery charger is included, you have to plug the camera into the wall directly. (battery is easily removable though)- The power input and cable is a proprietary connection meaning you&rsquo;d have to get replacement cables directly from Canon.- If you don&rsquo;t have enough light your video will look grainy, low res, out of focus&hellip; This is true for all cameras though, keep your expectations within reason.- The built in microphone sounds great from the front, but if you’re talking from behind the camera your voice will sound echoey and muffled. I’d recommend connecting an external mic if you plan to do commentary that way.- After reading through the manual and looking online, I still have no idea what &ldquo;View Assistance&rdquo; is in the settings. I think it goes hand in hand with Highlight Priority mode, but if anyone could explain it to me I&rsquo;d love to hear it.- This camera doesn&rsquo;t include any software. I remember buying a Canon DSLR a while back and THAT included all kinds of great tools for my PC, including a licensed version of Adobe Lightroom. I would have really liked to see that kind of frosting on top of this cake, but oh well.Thanks for reading, I&rsquo;d love to see your comments and helpful votes.</p>

<p>The last video camera I had took one of those little tapes, so this is an improvement to say the least.After doing my research I decided that this was a great deal for the cost and boy, was I right!The picture is great and with my 128 gb memory card I don&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of recording space.It records in two formats, one for easy posting on social media (like youtube), the other for a higher quality video.The actual size is very comfortable to hold, although it may seem too small for a person with large hands (I&rsquo;m a 5&rsquo;2&rdquo; woman with little girl hands).The battery is easy to slip on and off the back and does not place a weird weight on the camera while using it.First time charge for the battery was about 7 hours (the instructions say that too) so I was a little disappointed that I couldn&rsquo;t try the camera right away, but it worked fine the next day.Battery life is reasonable, but if you plan on filming hours at a time you may need a spare. I recorded several hours before switching over to my spare battery.Don&rsquo;t count on this camera to take great still shots - I find that I still use my normal camera for that, but in a pinch, the stills are easy enough to take.If you use a tripod, the screen rotates 180 degrees to point forward, so you can easily see what the camera is recording while standing in front of it.If you have a Windows 10 machine you can get an app that works with the camera software to take your videos off your camera and organize on your pc very easily.My biggest complaint is that in direct sunlight the LCD screen can be really hard to see, but that by no means is a deal breaker.Over all, great deal!EDIT:A year later and I love this camera just as much as I did when I purchased it. It is easy to travel with and easy to use!</p>

<p>You can see example footage and specs here: [&hellip;]This is a great camcorder for video. I am a Youtuber, so I picked it up as a new main camera to replace the Nikon j3 that I had been using. I was impressed by this camera. The sensor is great, it was able to handle every scene I was able to throw at it. Its compact and lightweight, which makes it easy to hold and maneuver. The LCD screen rotates 180 degrees to point forward, so you are able to see the shot while standing in front of the camera. The built in mics do a great job of recording audio, but it also has an external mic input, so you can use other microphones (like a wireless lavaliere mic) with this camera. It has a standard 1/4in-20 mount on the bottom, so it works with most tripods.The ability to record 1080p, 60 fps footage continuously is great. My Nikon J3 would overheat after 5-10 minutes of filming before it shut itself off due to heat. I tested this Canon by recording over 30 minutes, and there was no sense that it was about to overheat. So this camera is perfect for long recordings. The supplied battery will last over an hour on continuous shooting, but changing can take a while (7-10 hours).I am completely pleased with this camera. The I wish it had was a accessory shoe mount on top, but that isn&rsquo;t anything that a 3D printer can&rsquo;t handle! Its also impossible to manually adjust the aperture size, so getting the right focus depth can be a little challenging, so if you are filming B-roll where you need precise control over depth-of-field, then you might want to look elsewhere. For a main camera through, this is perfect.</p>

<p>I relied on the research of one of my employees to make thus purchase for youtube projects and have been very impressed. This is the lightest weight camcorder that could possible be this powerful. The quality is great but you will want to get an external (POWERED) mic to up your audio quality.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty good quality for the price. But the audio isn&rsquo;t that good unless you&rsquo;re talking a lot to cover up the background noise the camera makes.</p>
