<h5 id="very-powerfull-welll-built-there-is-no-alignment-or-attachment-problem-with-the-wand-if-you-do-it-right">Very powerfull! Welll built! There is no alignment or attachment problem with the wand if you do it right!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent little hand blender. Wife had surgery and needs to eat pureed foods for a few weeks. This works MUCH BETTER than our baby bullet (in fact, the baby bullet just plain sucked). Feels solid in my hand, perfect length to make whipped potatoes. Does a great job for milkshakes!I read a bunch of reviews on this product and many people complain about the wand coming off. It&rsquo;s not a problem with the wand, it is user error! When you attach the wand to the upper assembly, you need to align the &ldquo;tick&rdquo; marks up. There is one on the back of the motor housing, and one on the wand. Locked up tight when they are aligned.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a kitchen gadget fiend and freely admit it. There are some items that I buy and then realize they aren&rsquo;t as useful as I thought they would be. Others becomes indispensable. This blender definitely falls in that category! I&rsquo;ve had it for 8 years and it&rsquo;s still working as beautifully as it did on day one.This little guy is a great deal - great brand which has well made products and easy to use customer service if you ever need it. This is a good price on a stick/immersion blender, and it comes with a very handy container with lid to blend/store in. Although you can blend in any container it can be hard to find ones with nice tall sides to help prevent splatter. Mostly important if you&rsquo;re working with something hot or something that might stain!I use this most often to correct lumps in my frosting or white sauces. I also use it to quickly thicken up soups by partially blending them. It may not have the power of my Vitamix but it does an amazing job and it very quick/easy to pull out AND clean up. Nice long cord to reach all the way into the pot on the stove from wherever your outlet may be. My only complaint is that food can build up along the edge of the rubber seal on the inside of the metal area covering the base of the blades. I normally use a toothpick to clean along this edge and once in a while run a knife under the lip to make sure all the gunk gets cleaned out.Other than that I love everything about the design of this blender and wholeheartedly recommend it!</p>

<p>Got this for a friend who kept borrowing mine because she liked it so much! I use mine for pureeing soups and making smoothies mostly, comes with a cup that has measurements on the side and a lid for the cup so you can take it with you or store it in the fridge. Very easy to clean as long as you don&rsquo;t let things get dried up on it, just put in a bowl/mug of soapy water and turn it on and the blades will clean right up.</p>

<h5 id="this-review-seems-to-want-to-be-written-so-writing-it">This review seems to want to be written.. so writing it. :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am rusty on this item, but as this one item always shows up as an &ldquo;open review&rdquo; on the page of &ldquo;review your purchases&rdquo;, am writing a review to hopefully clear it out.From what I can recall on this, it was a simple hand blender that came with a little cup. Unlike other more complicated models, it lacked an Annoying Safety Switch which you had to mess with whenever you let your finger off the button. The metal Spinning-part can detach for washing, and a few people had issues with it coming off during use. One person commented that there were &ldquo;marks&rdquo; on the two pieces to show where they were to be attached, and if you attached it any other way, you&rsquo;d have an issue&hellip; So looks for the two &ldquo;marks&rdquo; on the blender when attaching the two pieces. I think it also had a knob on top to set between two speeds. There was also a second (more expensive) version of this which had more accessories. I think that they were two completely different devices, as the accessories from the more expensive one could not be used with this (the less expensive) one. So if one wanted more options, I guess try the more expensive one. But if one just wanted a blender (and a cup) then this would be a good choice.Other item of note is that one does NOT use hand blenders to &ldquo;crush ice&rdquo;. Even if one had special attachment, even if one had an attachment that actually SAID it would &ldquo;crush ice&rdquo;, what they actually mean is &ldquo;will crush PRE-CRUSHED ice&rdquo; not actual cubes. If you want to &ldquo;crush ice&rdquo; (like me) then get a something like a &ldquo;snow-cone machine&rdquo;. However even those usually say to let the ice &ldquo;melt a bit&rdquo; before crushing-away. If one tried to use a hand blender (attachment or not) to &ldquo;crush ice&rdquo;, odds are you&rsquo;ll end up burning out the blender&rsquo;s motor. Unfortunately I can speak with experience on this, so if you want to &ldquo;crush ice&rdquo; get something designed for that particular task rather than a hand blender. Amazon offers many different varieties from simple use to ones that can mash up pound-after-pound of frozen water.</p>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-use-simple-yet-effective">Very easy to use. Simple yet effective.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Went with this model mainly as it LACKED a &ldquo;lock/safety switch&rdquo; that the other more expensive models now have. On those models if you release the trigger for more than 2+ seconds, you might need to &ldquo;re-unlock&rdquo; the unit before it will switch on again. If you have one hand on a bowl/spoon and the other on the blender, it can be annoying to constantly have to re-re-unlock a safety switch. I miss the option of the little chopper attachment that my (dead) previous unit had, but for the moment all I need is a basic immersion blender. No frills blending is good enough for me.</p>
