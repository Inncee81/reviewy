<h5 id="perfect-read-if-you-have-trouble-flipping-the-mount">Perfect - READ IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FLIPPING THE MOUNT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is probably my favorite GoPro accessory other than the &ldquo;floating&rdquo; hand grip. The straps are made of a very high-quality stretchable fabric that look and feel like they&rsquo;ll never loose their elasticity. The clips are made of very thick plastic and the brackets that attach the straps to the mount are metal, and the mount is metal as well. There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that this thing will last a long time. You would think something like this would be uncomfortable to wear, but that&rsquo;s actually not the case. Straight out of the packaging, i put it on and the adjustment was already perfect. I&rsquo;m about 5&rsquo;7&rdquo;, 130 pounds, and the camera was just about right in center of my chest. I&rsquo;m sort of a skinny guy and it was slightly tight, but i think if you have it too loose, your footage will be a bit shaky and like i said before, the straps are so comfortable you barely notice you even have it on. There&rsquo;s also plenty of room to adjust the straps because it comes with all of them almost at their shortest length, but there&rsquo;s over a foot and a half of adjustment room for larger people. One thing to note is that this does NOT come with a case housing for your GoPro, which you need in order to mount it to most accessories, so keep that in mind.Now i&rsquo;d like to address one thing i&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talking about in other reviews. The camera mount on the harness comes upside-down when you first get it. Why they send them like this, i&rsquo;m not sure, but flipping it right-side up is rather simple; the mount is just like every other GoPro mount accessory, it&rsquo;s the slide-and-lock type (as opposed to bolt screw-in kind). Pinching the 2 ends together and pushing it out can be rather hard at first, but it will eventually pop out when you push it hard enough. There&rsquo;s also a second option if you really don&rsquo;t want to change the mount at all; most GoPros have an &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; setting you can set it to, which will flip your footage right-side up. Either way will work, but flipping the mount around the right way definitely isn&rsquo;t as hard as people are making it.In short: great product, will last a long time, and flipping the mount is easy.</p>

<h5 id="it-was-awesome-and-i-would-always-rinse-it-after-use">It was awesome and I would always rinse it after use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this in 2013 and used it probably 20 to 25 times in ocean and pool environments. It was awesome and I would always rinse it after use. Then a few weeks ago I tried to use but the clips that hold the camera mount into the harness both snapped off. I loved it so much I bought a new one - hope this lasts longer! See picture of new (left with the clips) and old (clips broken off).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="possible-broken-finger-nails">Possible broken finger nails!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though i have not used this mount yet, i gotta say&hellip;.. I read a review to &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; this mount because it was EXTREMELY difficult to remove the part that attaches to the camera.The person who made that review was CORRECT. if you plan on screwing and unscrewing your camera every time you use this thing its ok, but if you are trying to do a &ldquo;quick release&rdquo; good luck. It is very hard to remove the camera with the buckle attached to it, it actually hurt my fingers trying to remove it.Pros: you can rest assured that the camera won&rsquo;t be unbuckling at any time..Cons: if you are trying to remove your camera with the buckle attached&hellip;.. Good luck, it wont happen as easy as you think.i will still keep it, the price is right, and it secures your camera to the fullest.</p>

<h5 id="great-mount-for-the-go-pro-cameras">Great Mount for the Go Pro Cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my husband and he was ecstatic over it. He was looking for something more stable to mount his GoPro Hero3+ Silver to and this was the ticket. He uses his Go Pro camera during his fishing trips and the head mount was just too shaky on video. This chest mount is easy to use and the videos are a lot less shaky. Of course, there is still some movement but that all has to do with what type of activity you are filming. He is also very happy with the fact that this mount doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of the activity. Sometimes, he would hit his rod on the head mount when he was fighting a fishing, reeling in, etc. The chest mount solves this problem completely and he said he even forgets that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="chesty-working-as-described-for-now">Chesty Working as Described For Now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Chesty as I found the head mount is pretty much worthless. Like all Go Pro’s accessories are made out of plastic and therefore may break easier than if made of a more durable material. So far it is working the way I need it to. I am slowly adjusting the straps for as close to a perfect fit as possible. We will see how it holds up over time. One issue I have is that I wear a lot of shirts I do not tuck in and with movement it pulls the material up so I am adjusting my shirts and pulling them back down a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="more-than-i-wanted">More than I wanted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a hiker and I thought this might be better than the one that fits on your head. It is very robust and made for those that ski, motocross, etc. I wanted something a little more lightweight and comfortable. I am convinced this harness will stay on you if you go over a waterfall. Again it is very robust and heavy duty, just not what I was looking for. Hopes this helps others who are looking for a more lightweight solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-prefer-the-head-harness">I Prefer the Head Harness</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This harness works as it&rsquo;s supposed to. If you need a chest harness this is the way to go. However, I have never used it since I prefer the head strap. It&rsquo;s simpler, more comfortable, and does an equivalent job. I wear the head strap over my hat. BTW, I leave my GoPro on while hiking, etc., and then harvest the best stills when I get back. That way, you get the best shots and don&rsquo;t have to worry about stopping to snap pictures all day.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to use on a vacation. I used it to jetski in the gluf of mexico and deep sea fish. Coupled with my go pro hero 3 black edition, water proof casing, and go pro backdoor floaty, life was good! I&rsquo;d recommend either flipping the clip mount on the front, or adding an arm, otherwise the camera won&rsquo;t go up facing forward all the way. I inverted the clip that came on the chestie and it worked perfect. I got some GREAT photos on the jetski, and while fishing. the views were perfect. I love this thing! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll use it snowmobiling as I use a helmet mount and the suction cup mount, but I this thing gives a great vantage point!LOVE IT!!</p>
