<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-innovation-for-youth-baseball-player">Excellent Innovation for Youth Baseball Player</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Re-Grip Baseball and Softball Swing Consistency Batters Training Aid is an excellent product for beginners and looking to improve their swing. As a coach, we try to teach the players the proper path and not to roll their wrist. What this product does it keeps the hand consistent with the proper hold and players get the maximum power through their swing without rolling their wrist. This also help young players how to hold a bat and develop a proper swing path. I used this product with my son who is moving up to <sup>60</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub> using BBCOR. I noticed his hands started rolling again with a larger bat and his bat speed was slowing done. We brought this two weeks ago and started using it with the Swing Blaster training aid for bat speed and notice him going back to normal exit bat speed of 80mph+ using a BBCOR. I would recommend this for all players still having issues with rolling and if you have a Zepp you can measure their bat speed. Excellent product and innovation.</p>

<h5 id="little-leaguers-are-loving-it">Little Leaguers are Loving It!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I coach a Little League team of boys ranging from 7-11. All with varying degrees of experience in baseball. I started the season with the very basic fundamentals of baseball. If they&rsquo;re going to learn something new, they may as well learn it right the first time.I wasn&rsquo;t sure what their reaction to the Re-Grip would be, but I thought we&rsquo;d give it a try. I was so thrilled to receive 100% positive feedback from the boys. They love it, they felt it helps them swing more effectively, connect more, and builds their confidence. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that&rsquo;s the best possible result. They consistently remind me to make sure I bring them to practice and still try to convince me to use it in games. I&rsquo;ve shared it with the other coaches, and we&rsquo;re excited to implement this tool in our training program.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My team was given sample units prior to being sold(10 year olds). About half of them used them regularly and the ones that used them saw an immediate difference in their swing. The players that used them, played in both practice and games with them without any problems. There was about an even split of players using them with or without gloves. If they used gloves they just had to use a size or two bigger. A couple of players could not use them at all because their batting gloves were way to big to fit the product right (not a product issue the kids needed proper fitting gloves anyway). My son doesn&rsquo;t hit without his anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-great-comfort-great-results-great-product">Great value, great comfort, great results, GREAT product!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got the Re-Grip today for my 6 year old. I could see immediate improvement in his swing. The ease of use and comfort made using this aid a breeze. Some of the other batting aids we have purchased are cumbersome and ineffective. Super happy I found Re-Peat Sports. The price was good for the three grips we got, so my son can use them as he grows. Definitely keeping an eye on Re-Peat!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-not-for-6-year-old">Good product. Not for 6 year old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product does what it says it will do. However, beware. I bought these to help teach proper grip to my little softball player. She is 6, almost 7 and even the smallest size was waaaay to big to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="such-a-great-product-that-to-be-honest-at-first-i">Such a great product, that to be honest at first I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Such a great product, that to be honest at first I was kind of skeptical. &ldquo;A small rubber piece? That will improve my sons swing? No way!&rdquo; But long and behold my son now no longer lets go of the bat. He has an awesome follow thru now, one that actually puts all the energy from his motion into the bat and transfer to the ball. Letting go of his hands was the biggest struggle we&rsquo;ve had and now that struggle is gone. I love the product and for the price, you can&rsquo;t beat it. It&rsquo;s way cheaper than any hitting coach I&rsquo;ve ever seen and twice as effective!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Three sizes are included with this, but they seem really small. Kids complain too tight.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-1">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The re-grip is perfect for developing a consistent follow through motion. I&rsquo;ve used this for adult softball and my sons are using it for youth baseball. With re-grip my sons will continue to develop and perfect their swing. The package consisted of three different sizes that fit perfectly, even with batting gloves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-i-love-the-concept">but I love the concept</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids may be too young to use it, but I love the concept. Sons are 6 and 5 years of age.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great experience</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids are using this and feel it really helps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-money">Don&rsquo;t waste your money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your money, it&rsquo;s a great training aid to teach hand positions and hold the bat, but impossible to swing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="trash">Trash</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did not fit like it ssid would.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-product">Awesome product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this product one time for batting practice and just by changing my grip on the bat, I was able to knock it out into the outfield!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-value-in-the-expensive-world-of-youth-baseball">A great value in the expensive world of youth baseball</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spent an inordinate amount of money on equipment and tournament fees over the years so I&rsquo;m blown away by what I received for $13.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product! Works as described, and is very well made. Thank you Re-Grip!!</p>
