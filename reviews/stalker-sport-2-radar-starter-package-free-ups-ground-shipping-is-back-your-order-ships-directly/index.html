<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="as-accurate-as-the-guns-used-by-scouts">As accurate as the guns used by scouts</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unit is worth every penny. I used it recently during a scouting showcase event that my son attended. The readings I got were exactly the same as the readings the pro and college scouts got in their guns costing twice as much. Great investment and excellent tool for training to help your player get to the next level with no surprises.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-accurate-and-totally-worth-the-money">Easy-to-use, accurate and totally worth the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works great! I bought it as a birthday present for my husband after regretfully purchasing a lesser quality unit. This one is awesome and totally worth the money! It comes already set up for college baseball scouts. I was impressed that batteries were included! It also includes a very thorough manual. It worked great and was super accurate on the first try. My husband used it that day at our son&rsquo;s high school baseball game. His only suggestion would be to order a carrying case or something to protect it when not in use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-accurate">Not accurate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had an older Stalker radar gun that worked great but it needed servicing but they did not make parts for it anymore. I called Stalker and decided to purchase the Sports 2 gun per their advise. This gun from my experience was NOT accurate at all. It was off by 10 mph on the low side. It was consistently low. I had all the right setting entered, even spoke to a tech person at Stalker to verify that I am using this devise correctly. I was. The instructions were not that clear in general. I am going to exchange this for their The Stalker Pro ll.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-nice-features">Works great, nice features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, it works great and has nice features, such as the ability to shoot at an angle and set it so that it calculates the speed properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-gun">Excellent gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This gun is accurate and easy to use. For the money, it&rsquo;s the best gun out there. I use it to track the velocities of my little league pitchers. It is very good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-great-device">What a great device!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We use this with our Little League teams. It&rsquo;s easy to set up, use and understand. I don&rsquo;t know how well the less expensive models do, but I didn&rsquo;t want to take a chance. This one works and works well. The price was right for a professional quality device. It&rsquo;s amazingly accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this gun a few days ago and it seems to work like it is suppose to. They need to improve the cap for the battery compartment, it is the weakest part of the gun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-good-but-shows-lower-mph-then-actual-speed">It&rsquo;s good but shows lower mph then actual speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s consistently about 10mph lower than it shows but besides that very accurate. Wish that i wouldn&rsquo;t have to stand in front of the ball to get a good reading but overall content&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product and service!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to use. Accurate!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome gun, matches right with the Stalker Pro 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use">Easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well. Easy to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-radar-gun">Great Radar Gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my husband. He has used it every ball game and loves it. It does a good job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="accurate-readings-powerful-signal">Accurate readings, powerful signal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Picks up baseball pitches from behind the backstop the majority of the time.The manual could be a bit more clear, but the radar gun itself is very impressive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gun">Great Gun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great radar gun and greats folks at Stalker Radar. When I had questions, they immediately responded. Kept me informed about my order and when it shipped!</p>
