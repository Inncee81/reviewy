<h5 id="excellent-product-for-tv-wall-mount-project">Excellent product for TV wall mount project</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product for TV wall mount project.Its easy to install but you will need fish pool to run electric wires through the wall. My wall had insulation inside, and i was lucky to not have fire breakers in the wall. I am women and was able to do it on my own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-kit">Solid kit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice quality build on the components, everything is solid. I&rsquo;ll update this review once I install it.<strong>Update</strong>Well I installed this kit with ease! Just follow the included instructions and you should be good. The kit is very well made and the connectors snapped together with no problem. I recommend this kit to anyone looking for a clean wall mount look install!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-product-is-very-self-explanatory-and-an-easy-diy-project-without-hiring-a-handyman">The product is very self explanatory and an easy DIY project without hiring a handyman</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to purchasing this product I looked into various wall sleeves and other cable cover kits but nothing looked as appealing as the PowerBridge.Received the PowerBridge One-CK Recessed In-Wall Cable within two days and the product included detailed instructions with a wall mounting template. The product is very self explanatory and an easy DIY project without hiring a handyman. Prior to cutting holes into the wall ensure you are not cutting into electrical wires therefore I suggest to invest in a good Studsensor finder with electrical Wire Warning (can be purchased at Amazon for under $20). This is very fools prove and can&rsquo;t get any easier as this&hellip;.. The only suggestion I have for the manufacturer is perhaps include a surge protector but other than that fantastic product.</p>

<h5 id="great-kit-for-concealing-wires-behind-the-wall">Great kit for concealing wires behind the wall!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product for hiding wires behind the wall. I purchased this product to conceal my wires/cables for my wall mounted tv. The kit includes everything you need except the drywall saw and stud finder. It was super easy to do and took me about 40 minutes from beginning to end, including clean up. For the record, I&rsquo;m not a handy man, but a mom who can do things with clear directions. I used the kit to conceal the wires of my wall mounted tv in my room and had absolutely no problems. I love it so much that I intend on buying 3 more in the near future to hang all the tv&rsquo;s in the house!</p>

<h5 id="powerbridge-great">PowerBridge great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, looks great, not as fast or easy as advertised, insulation and bulk of wires create some difficulty and slow down. What helped was a homemade sturdy fishwire for cables, bought one that was flimsy and useless. But overall not difficult just more effort needed. Would recommend the double receptacles tho, mainly because they may be a little wider? Maybe? All mine fit in single, tho very snug. My satellite wiring was very bulky, adding wires from my DVD player also. Anymore than that seems like a little more room for wires would be needed. Pro&rsquo;s: Room appears larger, looks great. No more neck pain trying to watch-read tv with bifocals, all on one level now, like being in my lazy boy recliner at the theater! Con&rsquo;s: looking to buy another one to raise tv in bedroom(lol, just kidding, really need to do this now!), and buying a new TV credenza for Living room!! Yea me! Please see picture.</p>

<h5 id="greatest-idea-for-tv-installs">Greatest idea for TV installs!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was redoing my living room and needed to bury the wires in the wall. I had thought about just using wall plates with a giant hole in them, which I did and then realized how many wires I had. I also ran into a common problem, the power cord for the TV is too short to go through the wall, and using an extension cord is a plain old dumb idea, not to mention potential fire hazard. I looked at some other options and this is the one I came up with. It installed in a breeze, I just had to make my holes a bit bigger. There is plenty of room for media wiring, which right now I have a bunch of HDMI cables in there in case I need to add on at some later date. The dual outlets help out a lot because I have AppleTV and since that needs a power cord, I bought a mount for that to the back of the TV and just plugged it right in. It helps declutter, not sure about painting it, don&rsquo;t really need to in my scenario.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="why-didn-t-i-buy-this-sooner">Why didn&rsquo;t I buy this sooner?!?!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I found this product! I thought I was going to have to pay for an electrical outlet installation behind my wall-mounted tv. After some YouTube searching, I came across some PowerBridge videos. I purchased this one on Amazon, and let me tell you, if I can install this, anyone can! It keeps your cords neat and provides two electrical plugs behind your mounted tv. I will definitely be purchasing this brand for the other rooms. Home improvement made EASY!</p>

<h5 id="i-can-t-begin-to-say-how-glad-i-am-that-i-found-this">I can&rsquo;t begin to say how glad I am that I found this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t begin to say how glad I am that I found this. I looked for weeks for something until I stumbled on this and was surprised by the price ($54ish at purchase) considering the best option I found before it was in the $70&rsquo;s. Overall, it&rsquo;s a great value and I was pleased with how easy it was to install.While the plastic does feel a little weak, if you are patient and do things carefully, it&rsquo;s fine. You honestly would have to be violent to break it. The brushes will slide out if you don&rsquo;t put a small piece of painters or electrical tape over the ends but this wasn&rsquo;t a big deal.Despite what others have said, I crammed about 6 cables through both plates, the last 1 or 2 were difficult but I was able to make it work. This includes 4 HDMI, 1 CAT6e, 1 Optical, and 1 Xbox Kinect cord. I read one review that said you can&rsquo;t fit cords with the bulky thing near the connection but I fit the Kinect cord through and the thing on that connector is massive&hellip;seriously. You just have to work it through the plate and be patient.Reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars:-Plastic feels a little weak, but that&rsquo;s usually the case with plates like these-Paint on heads of screws comes off while screwing the plates to the wall-Kit should come with wider base plate to match wider opening in top plate-As other reviewers have stated, I don&rsquo;t think you should be able to unscrew the notch so far the thing falls off into the wall-As other reviewers have stated, the brushes will slide out during install so I recommend adding a small piece of painters or electrical tape to cover the opening on the sides</p>
