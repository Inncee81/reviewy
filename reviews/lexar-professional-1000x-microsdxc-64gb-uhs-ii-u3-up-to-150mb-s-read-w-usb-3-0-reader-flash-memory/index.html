<h5 id="lexar-1000x-microsdhc-good-but-not-great-actually-pretty-decent">Lexar 1000x microSDHC: Good but not Great. Actually pretty decent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Read performance is great &ndash; using the included USB reader I was able to get 140MB/s read. Write speed on the other hand is disappointing, again using the included USB card reader, I was only getting 40MB/s.Update: retested this on a PC running Windows 10. Previous test was done on an iMac and I mistakenly made the assumption that the test result on iMac would be comparable to test results posted by others using CrystalDiskMark. A sequential write speed of around 60MB/s was obtained on a PC, making it a significant improvement of write speed over the blue colored 633x card. I am updating the score to 5 stars.Realizing that the benchmark results posted by other folks are not necessarily directly comparable to mine I set out to create a comprehensive list of current microSD cards on the market. The results are below.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I had the opportunity to compare the performance of the fastest microsd cards currently available from top manufacturers.

Some of the worst performing cards in this review also happen to be the most expensive.Not all 633x cards are created equal. The two cards reviewed from Lexar and Transcend are both marked as 633x but vary in performance greatly.4k video recording using action cams and drone cameras have a typical bitrate of 60mbps or 100mbps, corresponding to 7.5MB/s to 12.5MB/s. All cards in this review should theoretically be able to handle this usage easily.Using microsd card as supplemental phone storage potentially could benefit from a faster card,Best Looking Card (if it matters):Sandisk Extreme Pro: Red/Gold with white printLexar 1000x: White/Gold with Black/White printSamsung Pro+: White/Black with a red stripe and Black/White printPNY Turbo: Lime Green/Black with Black/White printUpdate 9/14/2015: Added additional cards to the list.Update 9/18/2015: Added 128GB Sandisk Ultra and Lexar 633xUpdate 9/21/2015: Added 2 PNY Elite Performance cards</p>

<h5 id="awesome-fast-card-for-adoptable-storage">Awesome fast card for adoptable storage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Runs absolutely perfectly in my Moto X Pure Edition phone, used as adoptable storage. When converting to adoptable storage I still got the warning that the card appeared to be too slow and may cause performance issues. Well, rest assured it does not. Not sure what would not get that warning as this is one of the fasted cards you can buy right now, especially at this price point. Kind of wish I had gotten the 64 GB version though for the extra space, and according to another reviewer it slightly faster too. But this is plenty fast as it is.</p>

<h5 id="works-with-garmin-virb-ultra-30-action-camera-4k-30-fps-and-i-love-the-usb-adapter">Works with Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera, 4K/30 FPS and I love the USB adapter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to use with the Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera. I have recorded several videos at 4K/30 FPS (max resolution that the camera can dish out) without any issues so far. I also did some benchmarks using Ubuntu (dd, gnome-disk, iometer and bonnie++) and it has very high reading speed (+ 100 MB/s), but not so high writing speed.Initially I bought Samsung Pro Plus 128GB MicroSDXC Memory Card (MB-MD128DA/AM), which had away better benchmark when writing, but, at the end, what really matters is if the card can keep up with what the camera is dissing out and I ended up constantly having corrupted videos and/or corrupted G-Metrix, so I returned it. Before returning it, I tested the card for corruption, I did many benchmarks and the card passed on all of them. I still do not know why so many corrupted files (some of the videos would not play and I could not import the G-Metrix).The other thing that I love is the USB adapter, it has far better performance than the SD adapter that comes with most of the other brands, it fits on a regular USB port (no need to have a card reader) and it is easy to use. It also works with other brands of Micro SD.</p>

<h5 id="warning-you-need-a-uhs-ii-card-slot-to-take-advantage-of-the-speed-of-this-product">Warning: You Need a UHS-II Card Slot to Take Advantage of the &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; of this Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Warning, you need a device that supports the physical UHS-II interface to get the full speed on this product. Most microSDXC slots are NOT UHS-II, many even relatively new devices are only UHS-1. I made the mistake of trying to use this with the 2016 version of the Intel Compute Stick and that device only supports UHS-1. The net result is that the write transfer times are significantly slower with the Lexar Pro 1000X device than they are with the more commonly available and often cheaper UHS-1 cards.However, the USB3 adapter that comes with the Lexar Pro 1000X does provide pretty speedy performance, with reads around 150MB/s and writes between 70 and 80MB/s (measured with the CrystalDiskMark v5.1.2 utility). Contrast that to the what I got in the Compute Stick&rsquo;s UHS-I port, about 70 to 80MB/s on reads and only 25 to 50MB/s on writes (roughly one half of the speed that was produced with the USB3 adapter).In any case, note that the speeds shown above are with a benchmarking utility, so in either case your day-to-day transfer times are likely to be even slower than what is indicated above.Lesson learned, not all microSDXC UHS ports are the same when it comes to read/write speeds. Basically, if your device only supports UHS-I then you want to buy a UHS-I U3/Class10 device for the best possible performance (as of spring 2016).</p>

<h5 id="accurate-speeds-in-capable-devices">Accurate speeds in capable devices.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Read speed is accurate in capable devices. Sequential reads were 150+ MB/s and sequential writes were 51+ MB/s.Don&rsquo;t expect your phone to be able to max out the read or write speed. My phone (LG G4) had read speed of 81 MB/s and write speed of 38 MB/s.Benchmark was done on CrystalDiskMark 5.2.0 x64 on a USB 3.0 port using the included adapter/reader.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the card to get if you own a Garmin Virb Ultra 30! The G-Metrix was consistently being corrupted and missing from my pictures and videos using the Samsung Pro Plus 128GB MicroSDXC Memory Card (MB-MD128DA/AM). Don&rsquo;t waste your time and money on other cards as I did. This works flawlessly right out of the box!</p>
