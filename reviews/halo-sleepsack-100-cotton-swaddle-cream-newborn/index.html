Used in hospitals nationwide, the Halo SleepSack Swaddle is the #1 choice of hospitals and is recognized as &ldquo;Hip Healthy&rdquo; by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute. Its strong adjustable fasteners ensure a perfect fit and resist breakouts for more secure swaddling. Plus, its innovative zipper, unzips from the bottom allowing your baby to stay swaddled for easy diaper changes. HALO also proudly supports non-profit organizations like First Candle/SIDS Alliance.

<h5 id="rides-up">Rides up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I first got the newborn size and it was excellent. But my baby outgrew it fast. So then I ordered a bigger size. This item is not as nice as the first one. Please be careful parents. This sleep sack tends to ride up. I stopped using it because I found my baby in the morning with it up on her face.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-need-one">You need one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is amazing. We were using the SwaddleMe swaddlers when my little girl was a newborn but she outgrew them pretty quickly - she is a tall baby. These are a great transition swaddle/wearable blanket. There is a lot more room in the leg area so it was a great way to start transitioning her out of sleeping all swaddled up. She no longer needs to be swaddled (she is 5 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months old) but this still fits her and makes a great wearable blanket for her naps - you just have to wrap the little wings underneath baby&rsquo;s arms instead of over them. This thing has endured a grotesque amount of spitup and still looks almost brand new when it comes out of the wash. I now give these as baby gifts and wish we&rsquo;d had more of these when she was a newborn!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="best-swaddle-solution-if-your-baby-is-a-kicker">Best swaddle solution if your baby is a kicker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My baby really uses his legs a lot and i like that but when I use a regular blanket to swaddle him he kicks it off.I wanted to have a solution where I could swaddle him to prevent his startle reflex while simultaneously keeping him warm but I also wanted to have his legs free so that if he wanted to kick while sleeping or awake he could do that. This is a perfect solution and I cant believe more people dont know about this. The only issue I have with this is that it gets dirty a little quickly and is a little difficult to unravel after every wash.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-these-swaddles">Love these swaddles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these swaddles. Very helpful for parents who are not skilled in swaddling techniques using a standard blanket. I also found that it helps in keeping squirmy baby&rsquo;s hands inside. Our daughter was able to break out of most swaddling blankets but this product was great in containing her arms and preventing her from waking up due to the startle reflex. The zipper makes putting it on and taking it off really easy.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-for-the-novice-swaddler">Great for the novice swaddler</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Completely awesome. I have had a hard time adjusting to swaddling as a first time mom. Honestly it just seems cruel :-) restricting the babies movement but obviously babies really like it, including my little one. She&rsquo;s is a real hand/arm flailer and stretcher. Sleeps much longer and better when swaddled and this makes it easier than any of the other 5 items I&rsquo;ve tried. She likes the position with hands up Near the face most as she seems uncomfortable keeping her arms by her side. I don&rsquo;t know what size I have but I would say since she is really tiny (5lbs when we started with this) it sometimes rides up on her but I don&rsquo;t want to pull it to tight. Overall A+ halo, great for the novice swaddler.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-was-still-too-big-and-he-bust-out-of-it-pretty-quickly-and-then-we-found-him-in-the-morning">it was still too big and he bust out of it pretty quickly and then we found him in the morning &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked well for us but the sizing is weird. He fit in the newborn size for a long big time but started getting too long for it, so we sized up. Although he was over the age/weight minimum as stated on the packaging, it was still too big and he bust out of it pretty quickly and then we found him in the morning with material bunched up around his face. We loved the product when it fit but needs to be able to transition better from the newborn size.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="my-son-loves-it">My son loves it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the print and makes swaddling so easy! I like that my son can have his hands in or out. The fabric is soft and the zipper starting from the top and going down is AWESOME. Changing diapers is so easy because I dont have to completely remove the swaddle. The peace of mind I have knowing he is warm without the risk of being smothered by a loose blanket is so great.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-is-magic-completely-in-love-with-the-product">This is Magic!!!!!!! Completely in love with the product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is magical. The best baby purchase we have made. My daughter would not sleep more than 2 to 4 hours during the night. I put her in this a day before she turned 1 month old. We were exhausted after a month of not getting a full night’s sleep. It’s been 4 consecutive days that we have been using the swaddle sleeping sack and she has been sleeping between 7 and 8:30 hours each night!!!! I have a friend that is having a baby in March. I know exactly what gift she is getting from me and my husband. The gift of sleep. All the sleep her and her husband are going to get once they start using this amazing baby swaddle sack. I 100% recommend this product.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="needs-to-be-thinner-more-breathable">Needs to be thinner, more breathable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t work for my baby. I live in South Texas and this made my baby sweat when attempting to use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="never-even-put-baby-to-sleep-in-it">Never even put baby to sleep in it,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Never even put baby to sleep in it, it kept riding up over her mouth every time i tried to put it on</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works like magic to help the baby sleep. Much easier than a swaddle blanket.</p>

<p>Easy to use.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-for-newborns">A MUST for newborns</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;d be lost without these HALO SleepSack Swaddles! Had the newborn size and thought we&rsquo;d try going without the swaddle once she outgrew the newborn size&hellip;nope!</p>
