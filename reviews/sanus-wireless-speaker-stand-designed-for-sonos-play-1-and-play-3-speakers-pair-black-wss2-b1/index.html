<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="faulty-parts-included">Faulty parts included</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these for my Sonos Play 1 speakers. The instructions were well laid out and this was easy to put together. My issue with these speakers is that the collar that came with one of my stands does not fit on the tube. I only got 6 inches in and the collar was completely stuck. I had to hammer the collar off and scuff up the tube. The aesthetics of the tube are now totally compromised. The look of these was the entire reason that I purchased this set. I had a perfect assembly experience with the other stand. Sanus must have sent me a faulty part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect!!! Great price and looks awesome!!Great quality, came on time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wobbles">Wobbles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They do the job. Initial quality could be better. I&rsquo;m using these to hold up a pair of Play:1 speakers. The stands require complete assembly, which is pretty straightforward. However, neither base was completely flat? Warped, if you will. I&rsquo;m using these on a wood floor, so having all four feet on the floor is kind of important, otherwise the whole thing rocks. Given the price of a Sonos unit, I don&rsquo;t think you want to be throwing it around. Sanus honored the warranty, with zero hassle. Funny thing is, the replacement base isn&rsquo;t all that flat either. I give up. The product is otherwise pretty nice, but heads up about the base flatness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made">Well made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These stands are well made. The bases are easily heavy enough to keep Play1s upright. I&rsquo;m sure they are fine for Play3s, too. I also appreciated little details like the felt pad to prevent the stand from scratching the bottom of the speaker. (Or maybe they are meant to prevent speaker vibrations from rattling the stands).The stands are visually unobtrusive. I assume that&rsquo;s what is what the designers intended. I have placed them behind furniture so that you only see the speakers. Unobtrusive works for me.Only a few of minor quibbles on assembly. The small parts (screws, etc.) are pre-sorted, but the packages are mislabeled; the parts for step 1 are labeled step 3, step 2 - step 4, and so on. Also, plastic collars placed near the top and bottom of the support rods are hard to slip on. This is by design, but I needed to twist hard and use all of my 230 pounds to make them move. Lastly, the base collar has a tab which fits in a notch. I didn&rsquo;t see anything in the instructions that mentioned it, and I&rsquo;m not sure that mine are in right place. Their only apparent purpose is to ensure the &ldquo;Sanus&rdquo; label is lined up correctly. Because this product is so well done, I was happy to turn the label forward in hopes that this is what they would prefer. :-)I know that the collars are supposed to be tight because I emailed Sanus. They replied with help almost as soon as I pressed, &ldquo;Send.&rdquo; They told me not to be afraid to break them &ndash; they would replace them if I did while I was trying to put them on.I give the stands full marks because they do exactly what I want, and the form and fit are very good.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-your-sonos-home-theater">A must have for your Sonos home theater.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a friend order these stands for me and they are absolutely fantastic. I purchased two Sonos Play 1 speakers to use as surround sound in my living room. I did some research and found these stands to be highly rated AND made specifically for Sonos brand speakers. For what you pay for the speakers, it doesn&rsquo;t pay to skimp on the stands. If one tips over, your whole investment is gone!I purchased these as &ldquo;Amazon Re-Wrapped&rdquo;. They arrived extremely well packaged and in brand new condition. They are very well built, and took about 10 minutes to assemble. The directions are very well written, and the fastening hardware comes in a bag that has &ldquo;Step 3&rdquo;, &ldquo;Step 5&rdquo;, etc. written right on it. Kind of hard to goof up! I like that you can fish the cords through the hollow &ldquo;pipe portion&rdquo; of the stand. This creates an elegant and &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; look. The bases are heavy and balanced well, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about these tipping over (even on carpet). The finish is baked on, and it has a bit of a texture to it. This &ldquo;hard candy&rdquo; type of enameling means that the stands are not prone to scratches and nicks. They come with three different fastening brackets depending on if you have Play 1s or Play 3s. All in all, a fantastic buy. You are cheating yourself a bit if you don&rsquo;t get these to go with your system.</p>

<h5 id="the-stands-look-great-but-there-is-a-major-flaw-with-assembly">The stands look great but there is a major flaw with assembly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stands look great but there is a major flaw with assembly. There are 2 collars that are suppose to slide down each stand, however the collars weren&rsquo;t manufactured correctly on the stands we received and I couldn&rsquo;t even get them an inch down the stand before they were stuck. Had to use pliers to pull them off. This appears to be a widespread issue as others have recently commented on the same problem. I&rsquo;ve been buying on Amazon for many years and this is the first product I&rsquo;ve seen so highly rated with such a major design flaw. Buyer beware.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-addition-to-our-surround-sound-setup">Nice addition to our surround sound setup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very well made. Work perfectly with our SONOS Play3 rear surround speakers. Right at ear height while sitting on the sofa. Much nicer than mounting speakers on a wall with a cord hanging down, or installing a receptacle in the middle of the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="warning-collar-can-get-stuck">Warning - Collar can get stuck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the collars is totally stuck, just 12 inches down the tube. I put all my effort into moving it further but it&rsquo;s simply stuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ideal-stands">Ideal Stands</h5>

<p>Arrived on time. Easy to assembly. Using it in my bedroom and they work great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-very-poor-product">Very very poor product..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got the Stand from Best Buy. STAY AWAY from this stand. Really liked its look so took without hesitation. But the plastic collars are pathetic. They won&rsquo;t fit on the metal pipe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sanus-speaker-stands-pair">Sanus Speaker Stands (Pair)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stand fit and finish (powder coat) very, very good. Various brackets precisely fitted for Sonos Play 1 and 3 provided. All hardware supplied correct and functional.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-option-for-the-surround-sound-system-setup">Good option for the surround sound system setup.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Regretting not buying it early. Its sturdy and really looks good. For surround sound experience, its really good options for setting up support speakers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="look-and-work-great-for-my-surround-sound-speakers">Look and work great for my surround sound speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Look and work great for my surround sound speakers. Much better option then mounting them on the wall in my case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-pair">Perfect Pair</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my Sonos 1 speakers. Gets them up off the floor and at ear level. If you need stands for your Sonos, this is the pair.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really pleased with these - sturdy, easy to assemble, excellent quality</p>
