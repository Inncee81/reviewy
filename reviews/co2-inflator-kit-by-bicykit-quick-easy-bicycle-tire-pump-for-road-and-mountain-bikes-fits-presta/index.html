<h5 id="lightweight-well-designed-way-to-keep-your-tires-from-going-flat">lightweight well designed way to keep your tires from going flat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son and husband ride their bikes alot. We were looking for a way for them to be able to inflate the tires if needed along their journeys that was light weight and easy to transport. This kit is perfect, It fits in their backpack. It come in a nice carry case, has a thick insulated sleeve so keep your hands from getting cold when inflating and it&rsquo;s quick and easy to use, They couldn&rsquo;t be happier with the quality and convenience of the kit. screw the cartridge into the left top side of the nozzle insert the bottom onto the tire stem turn the red knob and watch your tire inflate quickly and easily</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-easy-to-use-and-compact-product">Great easy to use and compact product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool product! Small and easy to throw in a backpack or even a large pocket. Much more portable than a pump and a lot faster!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="5-stars">5 stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, great value, and excellent customer service. Used it a few times already and am very happy with this purchase. Would definitely reccomend to others!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="descent-product-but-needs-an-adapter-for-presta-valves">Descent product but needs an adapter for Presta valves.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product does not work with Presta valves. The other typical (auto, normal bike tire) type works fine. I added the adapter and the product does work as described.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-kit-for-anyone-that-has-a-mountain-bike">This is a great kit for anyone that has a mountain bike</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great kit for anyone that has a mountain bike , especially if your out riding often this is something I would not want to leave home without</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="convenient-and-nicely-packaged-inflator">Convenient and nicely packaged inflator</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The inflator arrived on time in a nice package. The kit looks really good with very sturdy looking valve. I don&rsquo;t have any flat tires to test this, and don&rsquo;t want to waste a CO2 cartridge just to make sure it works, but it all looks good and I&rsquo;m sure it will be a great inflator.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-easy-to-carry-when-you-re-riding-a-bike-is-a">and easy to carry when you&rsquo;re riding a bike is a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s small, and easy to carry when you&rsquo;re riding a bike is a great help as you do not get thrown when you&rsquo;re doing a long drive in the parkthe case is perfect because you have everything together the pipettes with the inflator</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-for-the-price">Okay for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good value, however the quality is not there. And because this is a product that&rsquo;s meant to save you from a flat in an emergency or when you&rsquo;re not near a proper pump, it&rsquo;s important for this to be a good quality tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommend">recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i am glad that i purchased this item, It has come in handy on two trips not only for me, but for other riders as well. I&rsquo;m going to get another plus maybe one more as a gift</p>
