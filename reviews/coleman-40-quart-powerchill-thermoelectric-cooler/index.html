<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this cooler just prior to going to visit my daughter in Houston Texas. I planned to drive from my home in New York state to Houston. Google Maps says that is about 1,750 miles each way. My car odometer agrees. I wanted something to keep some snacks and drinks cool along the way and did not want to worry about where I could get ice. Amazon, bless them, got it to me the Friday before I planed to leave on Monday.Since it is not a refrigeration unit I assumed it would take some time to get cold. I plugged it in Saturday morning (I also bought the power brick) and let it rum. Since I was not sure if it would really get cold I placed a thermometer inside so I could check. The temperature in the living room was about 74 degrees. By Sunday evening the cooler registered at 30 degrees.I packed the cooler with soda cans and water bottles chilled in the refrigerator. Also, some cut up veggies etc.. Other than the time the unit was unplugged during transport between the car and the hotel room it was running <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for 7 days counting the two before I left. The unit gave no problems while running in the car and the power brick never got more than warm to the touch. Never hot.I used the cooler exactly the same way on the return trip. The only problem I ever had was that some of my cut up veggies froze in their plastic container box. They actually had visible frost on them and were stuck together. All-in-all, I found the unit very convenient to use. It will be in the back seat of the car on any future trips around the country.EDIT: One thing I should add. During my stay in Houston the unit ran <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for 9 days using the power adapter.</p>

<h5 id="great-cooler-coleman-quality-would-you-expect-any-thing-less">Great cooler - Coleman quality - would you expect any thing less?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I came across a guy selling these coolers locally, with the power cable cut off, at a price I could not resist - so I took the chance &amp; bought one - brought it home, removed the &ldquo;electronics cover&rdquo; and added a power cable with cigarette lighter plug - tested it using an old 12V 4A AC adapter (it pulls just around 3.7~3.8A) - both fans ran, and it cooled.Now the correct way to test a cooler is to see if it&rsquo;ll keep your beer cold - so I went outside &amp; got a couple of beers and put them in the cooler - please note these beers were at room temperature when I put them in the cooler - sure enough a few hours later I had cold beer - the cooler didn&rsquo;t just keep the beer cold - it cooled the beer down - yes, it will do that - but, because it&rsquo;s not designed to, it&rsquo;s not very good at it.Some of the other reviewers have reported &ldquo;bad experiences&rdquo; so I think I&rsquo;d like to point out a few things - this is a &ldquo;thermo-electric&rdquo; cooler, not a refrigerator, so don&rsquo;t expect it to do the job of a fridge, (12V fridges are available, so if you need a fridge, buy one - expect to pay as much as 10x what this costs).Thermo-electric coolers are not energy efficient, they will drain your car battery if left running for more than a few hours with the car engine off, they will keep cold stuff cold, within stated limits - roughly 40*F less than ambient temperature - and please note ambient means outside the cooler, not outside the car you locked the cooler in - because temperatures in a locked car can get extremely high in the summer sun. A 12V fridge will do a better job at keeping your stuff cold in a locked car - it will draw around the same current as this cooler, but only do so when the compressor is running (see you do get what you pay for), but they will also drain your battery because the compressor will run longer in the heat.Read the manual (available for download from Coleman), it&rsquo;s a single sheet of paper printed both sides, so not a lot of reading, understand what it is you&rsquo;re buying, and you&rsquo;ll be almost as delighted as I am - the cooler will keep your cold stuff cold and do it just like Coleman claims, without the fuss &amp; the mess of ice, there will be no melt water, so no soggy food - and just in case you&rsquo;re curious as to why you won&rsquo;t be as delighted as I am - I got mine at a really, really, good price.</p>

<h5 id="worked-well-on-first-long-trip">Worked Well On First Long Trip</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband and I used this cooler for a trip from Ohio to Florida. We needed to keep our dog&rsquo;s fresh pet food cold and, of course, we had our own sandwiches, fruit, soft drinks and water. Although it is cumbersome to carry in and out of the car, if you follow the recommendations by cooling it first, cooling your items in the refrigerator before loading, and keeping it running either in the car or in another cool place, you will be very happy with the results. This is NOT a refrigerator, so it only cools well when in a cool place. It will chill the items to about 30 degrees below the environment. In other words, it will not chill items out in the hot sun. We brought it into our hotel room and plugged it in, It worked perfectly. With road noise in the car, we did not hear it run. My husband&rsquo;s only comment about the unit was that he wished it had wheels like some Igloos, since he was the one moving it in and out. I have attached a photo to illustrate the size. There is a Dasani water bottle on the rim for reference.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-camping-fridge">Great little camping fridge!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought one of these almost a year ago to use with my teardrop camper. One of my best camping purchases ever! As long as you keep it in the shade, it keeps up very well, even on really hot days. We had it outside the camper one night when the temps got down to the 50s, and woke up to find everything inside it FROZEN! I use it primarily for food, so I can keep the opening and closing of the door to a minimum, and freeze what food I can before storing inside.</p>

<h5 id="melting-power-plug-poor-fan-excellent-cooling">Melting power plug, poor fan, excellent cooling.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It cools very effectively and doesn&rsquo;t have to be plugged in overnight in cool weather. Good capacity. Two stars because the power plug lasted about 5 weeks of total use before melting and ceasing to function. The fan also became very noisy after about 1 week. I replaced the plug and it is working again, hope I can find a heavy-duty plug.</p>
