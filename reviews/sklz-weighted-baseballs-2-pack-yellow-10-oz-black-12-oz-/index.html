<blockquote>
<p>These balls work great for warming up. I don&rsquo;t think they are good for all applications.I have some suggestions and safety tips:1) These balls have a standard baseball cover but are twice the weight. The ball will take more skid damage if bounced off cement or asphalt. I recommend using the balls over grass or other soft surface. Even baseball field clay is likely too hard.2) For the same weight reason you shouldn&rsquo;t use these balls for batting (Says no batting on the label as well). Would probably destroy the bat and ball cover.(Might be cause of the &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t last long&rdquo; complaints)3) The balls are heavy so catching them in a standard mitt can be hard on the hand. Catcher&rsquo;s mitt is an option. Rolling grounders back to younger players is another.4) I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend these balls for use with kids under 8 and even then would limit usage to seasoned throwers and catchers. A missed catch over the top of a glove could take someone out.5) Prior to using the heavy balls I recommend a pre-warm up with regular baseball6) If suggest a warm down with a regular baseball after using the heavy balls to ensure accuracy.7) If playing catch with a younger player at least one of the catchers should be an adult or very skilled older player to avoid injury. For this reason you may wish to store the heavy balls out of reach of younger players8) Using these balls at pitching speed is likely highly dangerous to tendons. If you must pitch, most youth leagues have limits on how many pitches younger players can throw in a given period of time. I suggest take the recommendations and cut them in half or more. Similar to weightlifting you should allow recovery days between heavy ball work outs.Some of this is &ldquo;Warning: Coffee is Hot&rdquo; kind of common sense but just thought it needed to be said.Don&rsquo;t let my suggestions scare you off. These heavy baseballs are great, but just wanted to throw out there that they make better tools than toys&hellip;:)</p>

<h5 id="great-training">Great Training!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are perfect for training. We use the yellow ball for right now; haven&rsquo;t used the black, heavier ball yet. I throw this back and forth with my 10 year old after doing a session of long toss with a regular baseball. After finishing the heavy ball training, then we go straight to mound practice with a regular baseball. Over a few sessions we have already noticed a slight velocity increase.Be careful when starting with heavy ball training and start at a low number of throws, working your way up. As long as it isn&rsquo;t overdone, these can add a great addition to your pitching training.</p>

<h5 id="high-quality">high quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very high quality leather balls - dropped many time while playing catch and barely scuffed. Bought it mainly to break in a new wilson leather glove for my 8 yr old, figured that the heavier ball would break the glove in faster and it seems like it would work well for that purpose, only problem is that the 8 yr old doesn&rsquo;t have the arm strength to play catch with the heavier ball for any length of time that it would take to break the glove in - hopefully the little time spent playing catch with the heavier ball will build his arm strength - which is the actual advertised purpose of this training aid - I do feel that if I had another adult to play catch with, the 12 ounce ball would definitely break in the new leather mitt that much faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tool">Great tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The balls are a great tool for arm strengthening and warming up. My 10yo has been using them for a while and his throwing speed has really increased. It&rsquo;s always funny to see him throw a regular baseball after warming up with the increased weight of the SKLZ ball.</p>

<h5 id="the-concept-of-this-product-is-great-and-my-son-has-noticed-it-has-helped-with">The concept of this product is great and my son has noticed it has helped with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept of this product is great and my son has noticed it has helped with arm strength to just play catch with them. My only complaint which kept me from a 5 star review is the cheesy covering. They are somewhat slick and the stitching is so tight that they don&rsquo;t feel much like a real baseball. The material also has a strong smell, like real rubber tires (or those black rubber batting tees). I would recommend that they make these with a real leather cover with standard stitching (not too tight) and this product would be perfect!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-practice-tools">Great practice tools!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these heavy balls for my 9 year old. We have used them throughout the spring and summer so far. I have seen the improvements in his arm strength. He can now throw from 3rd to 1st with no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-training-tool">Good Training Tool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like weighted baseballs. I haven&rsquo;t been able to really use mine because of a leg injury that happened shortly after getting them in but I have used weighted balls in the past. They help with arm strength and speed which in return adds velocity. Use this for pregame warm-ups then throw a normal ball around for a little bit to get used to the change of weight and you will see an improvement within a few weeks to months. My friend was doing long toss daily with these and now has a walk-on at a D1 college as a pitcher. Last time I seen him throw he was in the high 80s low 90s. That was before he started this. Who knows, he might be the next Aroldis Chapman. I don&rsquo;t recommend these to younger players but if you are in High School you should really get to know these things!</p>

<p>These were a gift for my young, 10-year-old MBA-hopeful. He loves them. Be careful how use them though. If you&rsquo;re catching them, they can hit the glove like a ton of bricks.</p>
