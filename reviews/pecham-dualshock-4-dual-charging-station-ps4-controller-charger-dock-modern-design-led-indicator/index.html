<h5 id="great-2-controller-charger-for-any-ps4-owner">Great 2 Controller Charger for any PS4 Owner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great companion to my PS4. I was never a fan of having to charge up my controller via a USB cable. I think it&rsquo;s sloppy. I love the idea of a charging station. I have one for my Wii U, Xbox One, and now&hellip; my PS4&hellip; and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.I love that the charging station looks sleek. You can pretty much have it anywhere and it&rsquo;ll look good. You connect the charging dock via USB cable, so you can connect it directly to the PS4 or you can connect it any other power source via USB port. I have mine on my desk (connected via desktop USB charging station), with the other charging docks, and it looks right at home.As for the functions and features, it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward. You plug in the controller and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. The charging dock has 2 lights to indicate whether the controller is fully charged (green light) or if it needs charging (red). The controllers fit securely into the dock so you can rest assured that your PS4 controllers will not fall or bend the charging port. That was a huge problem for me with using a USB wire to charge the controllers. Any movement to the controller or wire while connected, run the risk of bending the metal connection and ruining the wire. No worries about that with this charging station.The charging times are pretty good. Great, actually. I had one controller charge up from dead to 100% in about 30 minutes. That&rsquo;s pretty good, if you ask me. I don&rsquo;t know how much of that is because of the desktop charging station that I am using to power (connected directly to the wall outlet) or if the PS4 charging station is just that good. Either way, it gets the job done and it does it extremely well!Lastly, you get a little bonus thumb tabs for your controllers when you order this. No complaints for added a little extra stuff to your order. The thumb tabs come in handy so I like having some extras laying around. When you play as much as I do, thumb pads get switched out quite frequently!So there you have it. A great charging station that simultaneously charges 2 controllers at once. I strongly recommend getting a charging station for any set of PS4 controllers you may own&hellip; and at under $10, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this great Pecham DualShock 4 Dual Charging Station!</p>

<h5 id="small-and-compact-but-works-well">Small and compact, but works well!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With a large family, we have quite a few PS4 remotes and can always utilize chargers. Recently one of our chargers broke so figured I&rsquo;d try this one. I love the simple design of this charger. Its smaller than I initially thought, especially since the controllers themselves already take up a lot of room, having another thing that is not so bulky is quite nice.The controllers click into place securely so there&rsquo;s no worry that the controllers will fall over or off the charging dock. The two indicators at the front let you know which charger is charging and which is full. There are two lights, labeled on and two, and they change color according to the controllers charge, ie. red - charging, green - charged.While i had a little bit of an issue getting the supplied USB cord into the charger initially, once it was in, it was secure and didn&rsquo;t wiggle or fall out. It charges the controllers at a decent rate so if you put the controller on the charger at night it&rsquo;ll easily be fully charged in the morning. Overall this charger is small and compact but does the job well.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-ps4">Great for PS4.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for PS4. I really like this charging dock. It makes displaying your controllers look a lot nicer, that way you don&rsquo;t have wires and your controller tangled up in your tv stand or on the floor. The controller easily clip into place and it holds up to two controllers, which is nice because I don&rsquo;t think most people have more than two. I really like the lights. If a controller is plugged into the dock it goes red. They are green otherwise. The best thing, is being able to charge both controllers with one plug. They also charge pretty fast. I was able to get a full charge in about 15 mins. Very impressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fast-charge">Fast charge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast charge for our ps4 controllers! My husband has a old charger for the ps4 controllerso and it took to long to charge and only for one controller on the charger. Now that we have this new charger we are able to charge the controllers fully within 30 minutes, and we can charge both of them at the same time or rotate them. When the charger is dead and charging the light is red, once itsaid finished charge the light turns green. I also like how small it is and can fit pretty much anywhere on our entertainment center.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-for-charging-controllers-out-of-the-way-and-convenient">Great product for charging controllers - out of the way and convenient.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This charging base is very small and discreet. It works well to the charge multiple controllers with only one USB cable, but does require the PS4 to be on and in standby in order to use the system as a power source. As an added bonus, this package included joystick grip covers, which was unexpected but greatly appreciated. These grips really help with gameplay and make the experience amazing! Great product for charging controllers - out of the way and convenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this product today and it&rsquo;s working as described. I&rsquo;m actually impressed. I&rsquo;ve always been an XBOX guy, bought a PS4 on a whim and really like the rechargeable controllers, and this really added to the overall experience for me, keeps the controllers in one central location and keeps them charged for anytime use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-will-see-how-long-it-holds-up">Good quality. Will see how long it holds up &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stand works very well. It charges 2 controllers while freeing up a sub on the PS4. Good quality. Will see how long it holds up with a 7 year old using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-power-connector-design">Poor power connector design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mini USB where the cable connect broke after 2 days. It&rsquo;s very poorly designed because there&rsquo;s no support. It should be surrounded by the plastic housing but it&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;m waiting for my other one to break soon too.</p>
