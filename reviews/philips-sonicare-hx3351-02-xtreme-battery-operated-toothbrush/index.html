<p>Product Description
Xtreme e3000 makes it easy for preteens and teens to practice good oral care-even with braces and brackets. With its patented sonic technology and 2-minute Smartimer the Sonicare Xtreme creates dynamic fluid action that leads to improved brushing compliance, healthier mouths, and better check-ups.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
The Philips Sonicare Xtreme Battery-Operated Toothbrush improves oral health with a special emphasis on portability. Safe, comfortable, and effective, the Xtreme encourages healthy oral hygiene habits for life.</p>

<p>The Extreme e3000 is extremely portable.</p>

<p>Patented Technology and Dynamic Fluid Action
The Xtreme creates a dynamic fluid cleaning action that drives fluids deep into the tight spaces between your teeth. In fact, the patented sonic technology behind the Xtreme&rsquo;s cleaning action can actually make it easier to clean plaque along the gum line, which results in a cleaner, healthier mouth. A combination of high frequency and high amplitude bristle motions remove more plaque than a manual toothbrush. These bristles are also designed to be extra gentle on teeth and gums.</p>

<p>Safely and Effectively Improves Oral Health
Sonicare&rsquo;s dynamic cleaning action results in better plaque removal, improved gum health, and naturally whiter teeth. The uniquely angled brush head neck makes it easier to reach back teeth, removing plaque in those hard-to-reach areas. Easy and comfortable to use, thanks to the contoured brush head, the Xtreme also features a Smartimer that automatically shuts off after the two-minute dentist recommended brushing time.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box
One Philips Sonicare Xtreme Battery-Operated Toothbrush and two AA batteries.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-that-there-are-no-recharging-station-with-cords-to">I love that there are no recharging station with cords to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love that there are no recharging station with cords to bother with. I use rechargeable batteries which need recharging about once every month with everyday use. I use a compact recharge unit for recharging AA batteries. And it works just as good as the higher priced models. It&rsquo;s a real shame that this model has been discontinued and replaced with another portable AA battery operated model that is very much inferior to this model. I first purchased this model for a very reasonable price of $29.99. Since it has be discontinued, it seems to still be in demand because the price has tripled&hellip;. that is, if you can find one at all. This purchase was for a backup to the one that I&rsquo;ve used for over a year and have had absolutely no problems&hellip; ever. I saw many complaints about water leaking into it causing battery corrosion. Common sense says to keep it out of water except for the brush tip and dry it after every use. Fantastic product!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-good-if-it-doesn-t-work">No good if it doesn&rsquo;t work.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was purchased to replace older unit of the same model. Changes has substantially and negatively affected the quality. Previous unit lasted three years. This unit had a cracked base and faulty switch after six weeks. A call to the manufacturer was frustrating, both because of the customer &ldquo;service&rdquo; rep&rsquo;s bad case of the &ldquo;can&rsquo;t help-its&rdquo; and because they kept pushing the higher end models, ignoring that the whole purpose of buying this model was the need for a battery-operated unit. They finally sent a replacement unit, which also died after a month. Ended up chucking it in the trash bin.As an aside, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the quality of Sonicare is steadily decreasing in general. We replaced our home brushes a couple years ago and noticed even then that the new (same as replacement) models felt less sturdy and didn&rsquo;t hold a charge as long as the older units.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-brushes-with-some-flaws">Good brushes with some flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of this for traveling purpose, one for me and one for my wife. They were convenient because they used regular AA batteries that were available anywhere in the world. We did not have to worry about bring a charger. We use the rechargeable Sonicare at home, so we want tooth brushes that mimic the same while traveling. However, we missed the programmed feature that our rechargeable unit had, i.e. it hesitate slightly every 30 seconds during the two minute cycle to prompt us to change brushing surfaces. This one went for straight two minutes, so we had to guesstimate when to change the teeth surface that we were cleaning. Also, both the two we owned had big problem with the battery covers. Neither one was able to snap close completely, leaving a gap for water to possibly getting in. Bad design on this part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="leaks-terribly">Leaks terribly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Another design disaster from Philips. When the old Sonicare died I didn&rsquo;t feel like buying another since they still use Ni-Cad batteries which were state of the art in the Eisenhower era but no longer. This portable brush has the potential to be perfect. It requires no base, no cord, no electrical outlet. The batteries are always as fresh as you want. Use any AA batteries - rechargeable, disposable, lithium. Heck, even Ni-Cads if you can find any. It&rsquo;s perfect for traveling. It can be stored horizontally. It takes the regular Sonicare heads.But its from Philips. I read all the reviews about it leaking so I was very, very careful. And when that didn&rsquo;t work, I tried running electrical tape around the bottom. To make a long story short, there are tiny channels that the water still gets in and after a week or so, the bottom cap wouldn&rsquo;t even stay on. A huge disappointment because I really liked it more than old Sonicare. Now I&rsquo;m hooked on true cordless so I&rsquo;ll have to check the other brands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-saved-a-lot-of-money-and-pain-with-this-brush">I have saved a lot of money and pain with this brush.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this for a number of years. It works great. The batteries last a long time and when they are going down it vibrates more than sonicares so I know it&rsquo;s time to change the batteries. I use the very small brushes and brush my Yorkies teeth every night before bed. They look great, no bad breath as long as I don&rsquo;t give her pork, and no need for big cost vet dental bills. This is the second Yorkie I have used this brush on. Neither one has objected to getting their teeth brushed. It is so much easier and efficient than hand brushing. I love the Sonicares for myself because it is easy to use and does a better job than I can with severe arthritis in my hands. We each have our own Sonicare but you can change the heads easily.</p>

<h5 id="my-preferred-sonicare-toothbrush">My Preferred SoniCare Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SoniCare toothbrushes do a great job brushing the teeth, so much better than others I&rsquo;ve tried as well as manual. I greatly prefer this battery operated model to the rechargeable SoniCare Essence, because there is less bathroom clutter, and replacing the AA batteries every 30 days is much simpler than dealing with all the recharging and cord placement. I&rsquo;m currently using one that I bought for a trip in 2009, so it is looking old but continues to work fine. More recently I&rsquo;ve been buying this model for relatives.The rechargeable SoniCare toothbrushes cost much more, even at Costco. And then the rechargeable batteries would go bad at some point anyway, and replacing them was such a pain. I got this battery operated &ldquo;travel&rdquo; model for a trip, and found it so much easier and simpler to use, with less bathroom clutter, that this is what we all use now.I tried out their newer and cheaper battery model, Philips Sonicare Powerup, and it doesn&rsquo;t vibrate quite as fast as the Xtreme, but is still better than other electric toothbrushes. So if you want something cheaper, consider that.Note: I used to regularly get this model for $25-$30, but now the going rate (as of this writing) seems to be about $40. However, I&rsquo;ve seen some greatly jacked up prices for this model from price-gouging businesses.</p>
