<h5 id="low-cost-modified-sine-wave-inverter-with-good-features-but-won-t-do-300w">Low cost modified sine wave inverter with good features. But won&rsquo;t do 300W!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Low cost modified sine wave inverter with good features. I purchased this inverter recently and evaluated it in an electronics lab and real world situations. $20 is a good price for a 300W inverter with the given features. Major note is that this a &ldquo;modified sine wave output&rdquo; device (as are most inexpensive inverters these days). The output voltage is not a sine wave but rather a pulse sequence of about 5ms of +145V, 3ms of 0V, 5ms of -145V, 3ms of 0V and then repeat. Output voltage measured as low as 108Vrms and as high as 116Vrms on a true RMS multimeter. Oscilloscope waveforms showed some distortion that got worse at higher loads. Modified sine wave is good enough for resistive loads such as heating and incandescent light bulbs. It may be OK for some electronics. I planned to use this to charge my drone batteries but will not with this output. Voiding the warrantee or damaging batteries is not something I will take a chance on. Modified sine wave can also cause some electronics to be less efficient.I tested the inverter with 25W, 75W and 150W incandescent bulbs single and in combinations. 12V input source was a regulated DC power supply with 50A capability. I set the DC output voltage to 12.0V.With no load on the AC output the inverter drew 0.28A or 3.3W.I have the detailed data but will only summarize input/output efficiency for this review:25W &ndash;&gt; 81%, 75W &ndash;&gt; 84%, 100W &ndash;&gt; 86%, 100W &ndash;&gt; 87%, 150W &ndash;&gt; 87%, 175 &ndash;&gt; 83%It takes about 1s after input power is turned on for output to turn on.The inverter did not seem warm at any time. If I do this again I will add a temperature sensor to the inverter.The inverter shut down during the 225 (150+75) test.The inverter would not start with 250 (150+75+25).The inverter would not smoothly run a desk fan.Another note is that I list the rated value of the bulb. The actual power (output power of inverter) was slightly less for each one but efficiency was 100% * output power measured / input power measured.Not being able to run 225W is disappointing but not unexpected.Note that at 225W, the inverter input current is about 20A. That is a lot of current through a cigarette lighter adapter if you try to use it. Fortunately this inverter comes with the ability to direct wire (using a 30A fuse) to a battery.In conclusion, I won&rsquo;t be using this inverter for what I intended. And, I don&rsquo;t know what I will use it for. But it didn&rsquo;t cost much, was fun to evaluate and likely will work OK for most people. So, 4 Stars</p>

<h5 id="excellent">Excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As usual with anything I purchase through Amazon it arrived on time. I am using this inverter to power a 110 volt electric knife in my boat to clean fish and it works great. I had one issue. In the reviews I read before purchasing people mentioned the fan running continuously and mine did not (so far) run at all. I contacted Aukey directly VIA e-mail and had a response the next morning. The answer is the fan will run when it gets warm enough to require it. I would also like to add I received an email from Aukey the day after delivery asking if my order had arrived on time and if I was satisfied. I am extremely impressed with Aukey customer service and am sure the inverter will continue to perform the task I bought it for.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-little-thing">Love this little thing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this little thing. Perfect for simple things in the car. Very small, very light and contrary to other reviews, silent. One thing I like is if its connected to a circuit that shuts off with the key (lighter), the USB ports are always active even if you turn the rear switch off until you turn off the car. Have not tested the 300W claim but it powers a lot of little things. Voltage is stable. Very happy.</p>

<h5 id="good-value-used-over-4000-miles-of-driving-this-summer">Good value. Used over 4000 miles of driving this summer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked well in our van for 2 separate 2000 mile road trips this summer. Ran my Lenova PC no issues. I don&rsquo;t have a battery installed on my laptop as it&rsquo;s broken, so I needed solid power. And my computer would have flickered or not functioned. No issues, no complaints. I feel like I got my monies worth for sure already. Ran this using the rear power outlet in Honda Odyssey. I bought some cheap 10ft USB charging cables, so we had my computer plugged in and 2 separate USB cell chargers all running at the same time. It didn&rsquo;t seem to charge the phones well, but I attributed that to the cheap cables and the voltage drop in 10ft of cable. Plus we were driving using GPS, so the screen was on a lot.</p>

<h5 id="fairly-compact-provides-ample-power-and-works-as-expected">Fairly compact, provides ample power, and works as expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product and works as expected. It&rsquo;s about the size of a small box of business cards and fits in the center console, though it does take up some space. The aluminum case helps to distribute heat and feels like a quality, durable product. I own two large screen cell phones and the newer phone drains faster than it charges even with my car&rsquo;s built in USB port, when I have the GPS running (my old phone didn&rsquo;t have this problem.) I figured, why not have this device handy, which can also help charge my laptop too. Using the USB port outputs more power so my newer cell phone does increase the battery charge while in use. I confirmed that the 3-prone sockets work too. The extra alligator clips is nice to have if you want to connect directly to your car battery, but in this stage of my life, I doubt I would ever do this. Have not used it in baking hot weather yet, but I can say it survived below 20 degrees F and continues to work without issue.I would put 5 starts, but it&rsquo;s a couple of points short of perfect - there is no circuit breaker or safety fuse (which means if you get a short, your car circuitry will have the bear the pain) and the plus are a little tight, where my cell phone wall plug is a little wide, so when used it blocks the other plug and the two USB ports. So if you have a few devices, simultaneous charging may be a challenge.</p>

<h5 id="died-in-4-minutes">Died in 4 minutes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought it and put it in the car. I go to use it 6 months later and it works for 4 minutes and dies. I was just charging my cell phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-laptops">Not for laptops</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This probably works fine fir most uses. Sadly, plugging a laptop into it immediatly sends it into an error state, and that was most of what we bought it for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great</p>

<h5 id="love">Love!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this to run my fish tank filter when power went out &amp; it worked like a charm!!! :)</p>

<p>Nice but don&rsquo;t last too long</p>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well but don&rsquo;t expect the fan to work. Keep in a well ventilated spot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="did-not-work-out-of-the-package-i-had">Did not work out of the package. I had &hellip;</h5>

<p>Did not work out of the package. I had to spend an hour disassembling the entire thing to resolder a wire.</p>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<p>Works great, used it on vacation in my car and plugged in my electric cooler.</p>
