<h5 id="fantastic-mount">Fantastic mount!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as I actually misplaced my phone mount for my Harley Davidson. I was looking for an inexpensive replacement option, as I fully expect to find it when I am not actually looking for it. However, this mount works fantastic! I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll put my other mount back on. It is extremely adjustable and sturdy. Despite the significant amount of normal vibration that one gets with a Harley, my phone vibrated very little in this mount. I use a Note 5 with a large protective case over it and it has no issue fitting inside. The securing straps are a nice safety feature, but I have no doubt it would hold the phone fine without them(Not that I&rsquo;d be willing to risk my phone to try it out). It even came with an extra set of the safety straps incase these were to break. Perhaps they will get weaker with prolonged exposure to the sun?I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid yet inexpensive mount for anything with handlebars. Well done!</p>

<h5 id="i-bought-it-and-gave-it-a-chance-and-i-m-glad-i-did">I bought it and gave it a chance and i&rsquo;m glad I did</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of these people that got this product for free in exchange for a review. I bought it and gave it a chance and i&rsquo;m glad I did. I have a huge phone, a Samsung Note 4 and this thing holds it flawlessly. Took me a bit to find a good place to mount it but when I did it has been great. Worth every penny. If I had one complaint it would be to have a better tightening system on the ball swivel. That being said it does not move when I ride, just as I put the phone on and off my bike. Very satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-product">Love the product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the product,I was unsure if it would hold up to the vibration of a Harley Davidson.It does and very well. They are clamped to a set of 17&rdquo; Ape hangers and hold my Motorola Droid Turbo 2 without any issues.</p>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-adjust">Very easy to adjust</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mounted this to my VStar handle bars today and rode 100 miles. About 50 miles on the freeway at 75mph, over multiple railroad tracks, rough roads and bounces. This baby didn&rsquo;t move at all. Held firm, my phone (s7) stayed secure and the viewing angle was fixed with the snug of the nut.I&rsquo;m skeptical as to the durability of this as it is 99% plastic after all but for now I&rsquo;m VERY impressed. This was exactly what I needed on the bike and I&rsquo;m completely confident in its ability to keep my phone secure and at the right viewing angle. Very easy to adjust!</p>

<h5 id="which-is-great-because-it-gets-him-outside-and-hanging-out-with">which is great because it gets him outside and hanging out with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son has been part of the Pokemon Go craze, which is great because it gets him outside and hanging out with his friends more than he used to. Since he and his friends often go out &ldquo;Go-ing&rdquo; on their bikes, he wanted something that he could use to hold his phone while he rides. He looked into several different cell phone mounts and decided to order this one.His feedback is that it works well, it does everything it&rsquo;s supposed to do, and he has not had any concerns about his phone not being held securely or the mount itself coming loose. He likes the swivel capability of the holder and he appreciates that a spare silicone holder was included in the box. His only negative comment, which isn&rsquo;t really negative, was that there is a small nut at the end of the mechanism that tightens/loosens the mount on the handlebar. He said the nut could be lost easily because it&rsquo;s so small. However, he also said that once the mount is on the handlebar, users aren&rsquo;t likely to be adjusting it a lot or taking it off and putting it back on a lot so losing the nut shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.All in all, he is glad to have this cell phone holder and I can see he will be getting a lot of use out of it in the upcoming months.</p>

<h5 id="harley-use">Harley use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far the mount is holding up. I am using it on a Harley Streetglide w stock handlebars. The phone is a 6+ with a Lifeproof case so I was worried about the size but it seems to be working. The rubber straps are a must as the phone slides out of the clamp. The Harley vibrations shake the phone a lot but stayed in place. We are on a week long ride from S Florida through the Carolinas and have hit rain and some bad roads but so far so good with the mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-satisfied">Very satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product is very simple to attach for the bike and it holds both my phone and my game and GPS unit perfectly. My only slight concern is that there should be some instructions as how to adjust the upper part of the unit so that it fits the handlebar. I did not understand the procedure to open it wider. I was afraid to force it because I might break it. But I finally figured it out. So I suggest they put in instruction in the packaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="glad-i-bought">Glad i bought!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took my maiden voyage with my new holder on the harley yesterday. Wasn&rsquo;t sure if my phone or the holder would make it to work and back but it did! Very secure silicone holder keeps phone tight in the spring adjusted hard holder. I&rsquo;ve looked at so many holders the last couple weeks and after reading reviews decided to bite the bullet and order this one. I&rsquo;m so happy I did. Very easy to install. I&rsquo;m not mechanically inclined at all I&rsquo;m and this was very easy with no tools required. Thank you for making a quality and very affordable holder!</p>
