<p>Boss Audio CH6520 Chaos Series 6.5&rdquo; 2-way Speaker</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these speakers for my 1990 Honda Accord LX. I know a thing or two about audio, but I&rsquo;m no master and I can&rsquo;t for sure root out the problem I&rsquo;m having, so I won&rsquo;t actually blame the speakers for my problems. Especially because I wasn&rsquo;t thinking and bought 4 of these. Almost as soon as I placed the order I thought to myself, &ldquo;Oh crap, I just bought 4 tweeter speakers, I&rsquo;m not going to have any base.&rdquo; And I don&rsquo;t.They are 6.5&rdquo; speakers and the website says they fit if your car is made for 6.5&rdquo; speakers. Mine, however, did not go in without serious modification. I should have given up and returned them, but I didn&rsquo;t care because my car was only $450. I highly suggest using a better gauge wire than they come with, that might be part of my problem, but I can&rsquo;t be sure because&hellip;I have a 10-year-old Sony Xplod radio and I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s out putting. I also have a 23-year-old stock amplifier in my car and I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s outputting, or if it&rsquo;s only to the rear speakers or all 4. I have a problem where the sound doesn&rsquo;t get very loud, the speakers start clipping and what not.READ THIS! THE SPEAKERS ARE INTENDED FOR THE FRONT ONLY, GET YOURSELF DIFFERENT SPEAKERS THAT DON&rsquo;T HAVE TWEETERS FOR THE REAR!If they don&rsquo;t fit your car, send them back. It&rsquo;s not worth it to modify your car to get the speakers in just to find out they don&rsquo;t sound very good with what you have. You get what you pay for, so if you&rsquo;re the farthest thing from a sound technician, ask someone who does know something on what to get (that goes for speakers, radio, amplifier, wires, etc.)I&rsquo;m probably going to redo the wires running through my car soon. That&rsquo;s going to be a lot of work, stripping out the interior and all, so seriously know what you&rsquo;re doing when you buy speakers; I know I do, but I get lazy sometimes and buy the wrong stuff.Is this a good product? Yes, I think so. Would I recommend it to anyone? No, simply because there&rsquo;s stuff out there that&rsquo;s much better. Instead of spending $17 on two speakers, spend $40-50+, after all, you&rsquo;re gong to be listening to them all the time for a very long time.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-fit-in-1992-honda-accord">Do Not Fit in 1992 Honda Accord!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought (and RMA&rsquo;d) these speakers. Amazon&rsquo;s site claimed they would install in a 1992 Accord. Bzzz. No way. The bowl of the speaker is weird and they do not fit into the Accord enclosure. Even if I could force-fit, none of the pre-drilled holes line up and I would have had to re-drill the mount. Pain in the neck for a cheap set of replacements. I was quite upset that I wasted 45 minutes in a 120 degree car trunk figuring out that these did not fit. Then add the inconvenience of having to return them. A colossal waste of time and for me, time is money&hellip; I ended up getting a set of JVC CS-V626 that fit and work just fine. The JVC&rsquo;s have a ring of pre-drilled mount holes that looks like could fit anything. The bowl size was the same as the original OEM. I&rsquo;d advise not wasting time with the Boss. Caveat, both are cheap speakers and will sound that way. If you want a loud Hi-Fi system, spend the money and get one. You won&rsquo;t get any better than the original weak Honda Audio experience with a cheap speaker and original deck. In my case, that was all I needed. The old original Honda paper-coned speakers were all blown out.</p>

<h5 id="buy-buy-buy">BUY BUY BUY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When you consider that the CHEAPEST set of speakers from Walmart or Frys cost about 25-30 bucks&hellip; these are a STEAL. I bought them for my 95&rsquo; 4runner. Electrically: super easy to instal. Aesthetically: it takes a little patience and ability to find the right place to put these in your door. Functionally: they sound way better than I was expecting! Decent bass and the sound is really clear. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would recommend these to a friend. Comes with Speaker wire and screws too! Complete kit!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sound-good-don-t-use-included-wires">Sound good, DON&rsquo;T USE INCLUDED WIRES</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered 2 sets of speakers to replace blown speakers in my VW. The sound was an incredible improvement over the bad speakers that were in my car. They had some bass to them and a pretty decent range. The red was tacky so I mounted the speakers behind the factory grills and discarded the included grills.Edit:After a few months of using, the speakers stopped working. I did some poking around and found that the tiny wires that come with the speakers with the push connectors had burned out. the wires were very thin and I guess that turning up the volume lit them up like a lightbulb filament. Do not use the wires that come in the box - ALL 4 were bad. I bought some push on connecters at Advance and within an hour had all 4 speakers working again.</p>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for-1">You get what you pay for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, these are good speakers, they sound good, but your getting what you pay for. They are not the best bang for the buck. I bought these &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; speakers off of Amazon because it had good reviews on other speaker sites yet cheaper on Amazon. These speakers sound the exact same as the cheaper Sony 2-way speakers at Walmart. But comparing these to the Sony 2-way speakers, this is the better pricing then those.There is not a lot of bass to these speakers. And the fitment on these speakers is a bit bigger then the &ldquo;6.5 inch&rdquo; specifications, it made it a very tight fit on my small car. For a few hours I was doing measurements and wasn&rsquo;t happy that these speakers was an half an inch bigger. I had to drill new screw holes and adjust the position the speaker to get this guy to fit on the front of my car, wasn&rsquo;t too happy with that all. I was glad I had a drill on me that day, I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people wouldn&rsquo;t even want to do this, so I&rsquo;d say if this was a concern for you, make sure you have some room to play with where these speakers are going to and you don&rsquo;t have the issues of having a small car where extra space is rare.</p>

<h5 id="have-the-wattage-to-push-these">Have the wattage to push these.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was using these boss 6.5 250 watt speakers with a pioneer deh-150 head unit and they sound good for the price; decent high and mid but not much bass. I found I had distortion at past medium volume, but I&rsquo;m sure that have to do with the my head unit output, not these speakers.. I think with a amp these speakers will perform great.</p>
