<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="must-be-a-new-model-because-no-vignetting">Must be a new model, because NO VIGNETTING!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so I read all the reviews saying that using the filter in superwide mode will cause vignetting. Well, I received the Luxebell C200 housing, took both videos and photos in superwide mode with the included filter, and it was perfect. NO VIGNETTING AT ALL!!! So, I was pleasantly surprised and happy about that. As for the body itself, it is great. The fit and finish are flawless. My GoPro Hero 4 Silver fits snugly inside and the screw on the side holds the GoPro nice and tight. The best thing about this aluminum body, which makes this one better than the rest, is the slide on back. This protects the built-in screen on the Silver, and gives the whole thing a nice finished look. Unlike the others, where the back screen sits flush with the body, not protecting it. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase, and would recommend this to any GoPro user looking for an aluminum housing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="written-for-those-wanting-to-try-this-to-heatsink-the-gopro-hero-5-overheat-shutdown-problem">Written for those wanting to try this to heatsink the gopro hero 5 overheat / shutdown problem.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>GoPro Hero5 still overheats at 10:23 seconds - on my 2nd new one. This one is going back too. (Gopro) If you are looking at this for a type of heatsink - don&rsquo;t. YMMV If you want a good case - this is a nice one with a issue or two.If you don&rsquo;t have trouble with your GoPro Hero 5 overheating - this thing is great as it has a useable and decent clip-on lens protector. I don&rsquo;t use lens protectors but this one was nice enough I do now. It will survive a few bounces.Why the Ding? It fits loose inside until you turn a screw to hold it against the opposite side, leaving the right side not on the aluminium frame much - meaning missed opportunity for more heatsink potential. Plus it adds a pressure point to the left side of the camera to turn the screw to be the item that keeps the gopro hero 5 still inside the case on the left side.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-4">Excellent product. 4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product. 4.5 stars. Well built. No vignetting whatsoever. Camera fits snugly inside the skeleton. Has <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-20 screw holes for tripod, GoPro mount adapter, and hot shoe adapter. Threads are good. Excellent value.If the back plate allowed for access to the GoPro expansion port (my intention is to power the camera with the Switronix GoPro battery eliminator cable), and/or they offered an alternate back plate that made the expansion port accessible with the back plate installed, then I would give this 5 stars. As it is, I&rsquo;m going to modify the back plate with a dremel or file.Update 2016-04-14I filed the inside left edge of the rear gate just enough to allow access to the 30-pin connector so I could power the GoPro via a 12V USB super capacitor adapter. Worked out very well. This is a great little GoPro cage. Due to the weight, I&rsquo;d recommend this to people who are planning on using it as an external auto or motorcycle mount. It&rsquo;s a bit of overkill to put on a selfie stick, and probably a little too heavy to be ideal for a drone. Really good product overall. If you&rsquo;re a DOP/1st/2nd AC, DIT, or just a camera nerd with lots of kit, definitely buy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="makes-using-your-gopro-more-versatile">Makes using your GoPro more versatile</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the newest version that solves all the previous issues and makes using the GoPro more versatile and fun. No vignetting in superview because of the larger lens area. Nice back door so you don&rsquo;t have to tighten the side screw to hold the camera in place. Having the ability to add lights and external microphones with the hot or cold shoe ( can&rsquo;t remember one from the other ) is really nice and makes this look like a niche professional piece of equipment. And the ability to add 52mm lenses just makes using a GoPro all the better. Nice build quality nice fit and finish. If I lost this or if it got stolen I would buy another one. It could use a drop in price but this is the only one that I have come across with the larger lens area.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-aluminum-frame-for-hero4-silver">Nice Aluminum frame for HERO4 Silver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked the aluminum case a lot. Well made. The lens protector is less useful. It does not work in WIDE mode. You end up seeing the edges of the lens cover frame. Sadly I did not realize this until I took a few hundred pictures on a trip to Europe. Luckily I take most Photos in Medium mode. I would have gave it 5 stars had this not happened. I mounted it to the new folding GOPRO handle which worked great. I also mounted a MIC on the top using the shoe that came with this it worked great. Too bad about the lens cover protector. SEE attached picture. The thing on the top is my MIC which I moved back after I noticed it was also in view. I did not notice the corners in the screen on my HERO4 Silver.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="heavy">Heavy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found the item has multiple issues the three or four time I placed my GoPro. First it significantly adds more weight. Second come with a strap but no specific hole is available to place the strap. Three the mounting brackat comes loose. So loctite is needed on the threads to keep it secure. Four it&rsquo;s difficult the remove the GoPro from the case. The lense cover on the GoPro gets wedged. The UV filter must be removed to put pressure on the lense cover. I already ordered replacement lense cover for the GoPro because if I keep using this case, the lense cover will wear down around the edges which I feel will jeapardize the waterproof ability of the GoPro. The case will protect but not practical. GoPros are meant as action cameras. The use of this case I deemed is for only for might activity such as siteseeing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lot-s-of-metal-and-really-nice-build-quality">Lot&rsquo;s of metal and really nice build quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bit of kit here. I bought one and as soon as I put it on my GoPro and used it a bit I bought another one for my 2nd GoPro. These are now permanent fixtures on my cameras. These give you the ability to use regular camera or tripod mounts, as well as mount accessories to it such as shotgun mics or lights or whatever you might mount to a DSLR. It also comes with a protective lens to keep your GoPro lens safe and secure during all your wild action videos.I mounted a LP Mic/Videomic/Video/Shotgun Microphone to mine so I can pull in better quality audio.</p>

<p>Offers great protection. I used it on the Sacramento Mile Amateur motorcycle race and subjected it to a 70 mph get off. It survived along with me. It more than me I guess.</p>

<h5 id="blocks-gps-signal">Blocks gps signal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great case, provides good protection but it prevents gps from receiving signal. This case will not work for anyone trying to capture gps data with their hero5 black.</p>
