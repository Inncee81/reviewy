<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product for the price. Comes with an extra cable and a nylon carrying bag with a draw string.I only wish it had instructions included for cutting the cable to the appropriate length. After a few YouTube videos and a google search I figured out how to measure the correct length, actually I might have gone a bit short for my level of skill (just shy of beginner, seeing as how I haven&rsquo;t jump-roped since grade school), but luckily there is the extra cable included.The owner of the company reached out to me via e-mail after my purchase to confirm that I am satisfied with the product which is awesome and shows that this company takes pride in their merchandise.I would recommend this to a friend and will most likely buy again&hellip;if I continue to incorporate jump-roping in my workout regimen that is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-how-i-can-adjust-the-length-of-this-jump">I love how I can adjust the length of this jump &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love how I can adjust the length of this jump rope. I&rsquo;m super short and being able to adjust it is awesome. And it&rsquo;s easy to do so my sister who is taller can quickly adjust it to fit her needs.I love the little bag it came in also. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d use it but I&rsquo;m being good and putting it back after each use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-love-their-jump-rope">Absolutely love their jump rope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely love their jump rope. Its great for intense sessions like CrossFit. It seems highly durable and has a great lifetime warranty. Highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="flawed-design-broke-after-one-week">Flawed design, broke after one week.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to start jump roping five minutes a day and after 6 days my rope is broken and unusable.If you look at the picture of the rope you see the little metal ring that is used to adjust the jump rope to your height. A small screw fastens in to the metal ring, tightening down on the rope and holding the handles in place. The problem is, I&rsquo;m a beginner and after about 30 seconds I trip up or step on the rope. The momentum from my hands keeps pulling on the handles and from time to time I would rip the handles off the rope and the screw and metal ring would go flying (experienced jump ropers probably wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem, but I don&rsquo;t see how it is avoidable for beginners). The first two times this occurred, I was able to find the screw and metal ring (luckily they didn&rsquo;t fly into the nearby grass, otherwise I would have never found them) the third time I stripped the screw. I can no longer fasten the ring down and the jump rope is no longer useable.I only got to use it for about 30-40 minutes. What a waste!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="boxer-in-training">Boxer in training</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Made well! Easy to put together. Easy to adjust. Light weight, makes jumping easier. Make sure you tighten screws really good and you have no issues. Defiantly will order from this make again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-jump-rope-definitely-buy-it">Awesome Jump Rope! Definitely buy it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The jump rope is really nice! Feels and looks durable and when I use it, it feels great in your hands. It cuts through the wind really nice and makes me feel like a pro jump roper!. I received two so I was able to give one to my girlfriend and I appreciate the gift. You will need to cut the jump rope, but it&rsquo;s not too much of a hassle. The cut was clean and it didn&rsquo;t get all split like some tend to get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-good-quality-jumprope">It&rsquo;s a good quality jumprope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good quality jumprope. Very useful that they sent replacement parts for the rope, as well as a carrying bag. I like how it has the potential to be shortened, and how it comes long for taller people. When it arrived it had a nauseating plastic smell, which bothers me. Overall, it is a pretty good rope for the price. I recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended">Highly recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love that it comes with a carry pouch. Everything came and i havent had a chance yet to size it and use it but im satisfied so far. I love how small the rope itself is and how sleek the handles are. The fact that the company and creator contacts you to me is incredible. I had no problem downloading my ebook thing and i actually downloaded on my parents computer and then uploaded it to my google drive so i dont have to search for it. The videos are a plus. Im new to jump rope as an actual work out but im excited and with these videos i dont have to searchhow to do certain things cause its all given to me. I would definitly buy again from this company.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this product, it&rsquo;s everything I was looking for and then some. This company really goes above and beyond, and it&rsquo;s appreciated!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-adjust-the-height">Easy to adjust the height</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for!! Easy to adjust the height!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-you-loose-things-easily">Do you loose things easily?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its ok&hellip; bought it for my kid. Not a solid way to make a jump rope. To many little things u can loose easily. Then u can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very nice</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I expected. Great follow up customer service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-jump-rope">Great jump rope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very light weight and I love that I can pick the color I want because I was able to get my favorite color! It gets the job done !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this rope! Easy to adjust and super great quality :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-adjust">Easy to adjust</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to adjust, easy to use! It comes with a nice little bag to store it in as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hard to use. Can&rsquo;t cut the wire without proper wire cutters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it-it-s-lightweight">I love it. It&rsquo;s lightweight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love it. It&rsquo;s lightweight, but fast and rotates smoothly. Very easy to adjust and certainly plenty of cord for tall people. And green is my favorite color.</p>
