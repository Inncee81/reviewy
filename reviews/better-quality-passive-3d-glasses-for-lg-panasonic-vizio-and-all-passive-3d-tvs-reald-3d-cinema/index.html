<h5 id="much-better-quality-in-this-price-group-great-pair-for-the-king-and-queen-of-the-new-tv-buy-the-cheaper-set-of-4-for-the-kids">Much better Quality in this &ldquo;Price Group&rdquo; Great Pair for the King and Queen of the new TV -buy the cheaper set of 4 for the kids</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent Quality, huge improvement over standard LG glasses - they feel like a good quality pair of Sunglasses but a lot lighter. They wrap around and block out ambient light and motion from the sides, extremely comfortable and the wrap around design actually helps keep you focused on the TV - lets say they block out noise and interference by focusing your vision straight ahead at the TV. As far as performance - the lens are definitely superior to the rather cheap stuff you get for less, no distortion due to poor lens quality or warped thin plastic, because of higher quality they appear to be more scratch resistant - time will tell but all in all I think these are built to last, they are nice and tight on your face so they wont fall off and they don&rsquo;t have that cheap feeling - they almost feel like they were custom fitted to your face. Great value although 2x the price of the cheap ones available - I bought these for me and the &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; of the house - guests and children get the other set available on Amazon (set of 4) - these are also better quality than the LG pair that comes with the TV but not nearly as good as the pair I am reviewing now - and finally the pair that came with the TV are for causal guests/kids friends that come over or to replace a pair that gets lost or broken until I can re-order.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-glasses-for-the-price-and-a-customer-support">Awesome glasses for the price, and A+ customer support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello, i have been looking for good passive glasses that will fit over my perscriptions, Ive tried clip ons. Larger versions from amazon, all didnt do what i wanted it to do. Block light, and fit right over my perscripted glasses.This right here did exactly that, i have been doing extensive testing for a few weeks which is why i havent wrote a review for it yet, but im ready now.These glasses are absolutely amazing and very good looking on your face, they actually help block the light out by quite alot, and have a great feel to it when wearing it, which also helps with 3D viewing experience. Overall they are excellent buy. I recomend them to anyone who is looking to get better glasses. These are the ones to go for.Now on to some other things.I had to contact the company as one of my passives lenses popped out somehow, I struggled to put it back in, so I contacted the company and one of their representives answered the email promptly and were very kind to me, even offered to send me another box with 2 in them just like this one. I can honestly say this is a very good company to do business with. Just today I managed to get the glasses lenses&rsquo;s popped back in, and now I have 4 3D glasses, and if I need more for like a small party. I will be ordering more from this company.Pros:Looks goodLightweightBlocks 99% of light, I think its 100% for me.Easy to cleanComes with 2 microfibric bags and also keeps them clean.Cons:If lenses pop out, can be a bit difficult</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-any-passive-3d-system">A must have for any passive 3d system</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have spent thousands of dollars on hardware and media for my 3d system. I had a friend over recently and he commented on the cheap glasses. Yes, I had been using the cheap glasses that came free with my tv. I found these and ordered and I cannot believe I did not do it sooner. The quality is significantly better with less ghosting and cross talk. Do yourself a favor and get these if you do not have some quality glasses yet.</p>

<h5 id="must-have-for-people-with-glasses">Must have for people with glasses!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you wear glasses, then this is a must have. The glasses a movie theater gives out are uncomfortable. These are much better. I like the way it blocks out any additional light one the sides. It rests on the frame of my glasses so it doesn&rsquo;t give you that awkward feeling of a 2nd pair on your nose. I have only used it once, but I thought the quality of the 3D effect was as good or better than the movie theater version. I highly recommend these.</p>

<h5 id="they-work-beautifully-the-enclosed-side-prevent-glare-from-surrounding-lights">they work beautifully. The enclosed side prevent glare from surrounding lights</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well worth the purchase, they are inexpensive, they work beautifully. The enclosed side prevent glare from surrounding lights, they are crystal clear. I could swear the picture looks sharper in the 3D with the glasses on than with them off. I&rsquo;ve tried them with youtube, blurays, dvd&rsquo;s, and also with several PC games as i have my TV set up as my monitor. best part is they so clear they cause no eyestrain like i usually get from the ones at the theater. Im buying 2 more sets for my friends to use when they come over. they are gonna be blown away.</p>

<h5 id="quality-is-first-rate-in-these-fine-3d-passive-glasses-highly-recommended">Quality is first rate in these fine 3D passive glasses &ndash; highly recommended!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These 3D glasses are truly a quality item. By using them for several months now, each time I put them on I am reminded of the care and consideration that went into the creation of this product. When the box arrived, each pair of glasses is placed in a bag made of microfiber fabric that has a pull tie to close it. The bag serves as a cleaning cloth so that marks and smudges can easily and quickly be removed before use. The glasses themselves are quite sturdy and comfortable to wear. As anyone who watches a 3D films knows, light creeping in from the side is of no benefit. The large “blinders” on each side help to keep the focus totally on the film while not blocking anything needed in view. They are also quite sturdy. In every way these glass have proven to be completely satisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-they-may-be-too-small">Beware They May Be Too Small</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are a better quality 3D glasses however they may be too small to correctly fit over average size adult prescription glasses. The listing picture shows them completely covering a pair of prescription glasses. This is misleading because the prescription glasses they use must be small granny size glasses. So if you intend to wear these 3D glasses over prescription glasses beware that they may not correctly fit over your prescription glasses (my prescription glasses are of a small medium size and these 3D glasses did not completely cover over them). For the money, you would think that they would offer these in different sizes, i.e. small (like the current ones) or at least one size bigger then what they have.</p>
