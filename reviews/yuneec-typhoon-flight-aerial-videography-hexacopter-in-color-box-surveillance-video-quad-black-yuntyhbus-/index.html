<h5 id="typhoon-h-the-drone-that-worked-for-me">Typhoon H, the drone that worked for me!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned the unit for a few months now. I wanted to make sure that I put enough flight time in and fully tested the unit before I made my review. I spent many hours researching the different features within the different drones available. When deciding what drone I wanted, I had to realize what purpose I wanted the drone for. I do a lot of extreme sports and I wanted a drone that would be easy to fly and have the ability to capture the video that I wanted. It came down to the DJI Phantom 4 and the Yuneec Typhoon H. Both drones are amazing but each have their own pros and cons.Here are the reasons I chose the Typhoon H over the Phantom 4:First and foremost, I wanted a drone that had a follow me feature. Specifically one that was easy to use. Even though the P4 has the easiest tracking feature, there were some major flaws. DJI worked on visual tracking. Sometime the drone could not keep up and would lose sight or if I went behind a tree or under some brush, it would lose its tracking ability. It also cannot descend while in tracking mode. DJI does not allow it to go below the starting altitude, so when causing down a mountain, I would get smaller and smaller until it completely lost its subject. With the Typhoon H, I am able to use the Wizard remote, which is not much bigger than an apple remote, and have the drone track me by GPS. This would also allow me to swim in water and still have the drone follow.I also wanted a drone that had a 360 gimbal. Now this seems to be a very touchy subject amongst the drones. Some people say, &ldquo;why not just use the yaw of the drone for panning the camera&rdquo;? That could work, but for a professional videographer as myself, the smoothness is just not there. It is easier to have the drone hover in place and use the camera controls to get the shot the you are looking for. I have also noticed that with the P4, at times you would see the landing gear. This was a major draw back for me, but again, its all in how you are using the drone.These were the two things that were most important for me and that is why I chose the Typhoon H. You may have different things that are important to you, such as GPS redundancies.My experience with the Typhoon H up till this point has been flawless and I&rsquo;m very glad that I made this my drone of choice. It does take some getting use to the controller as it looks very intimidating. I can tell you this, take your time, learn your drone and you will become very familiar with it in no time. You will definitely want to buy extra batteries, yes, the flight time is not as long as the P4. I went flying with a friend who owns a DJI Inspire 1, which he uses for search and rescue with our local sheriffs department, and he had more fun flying the Typhoon H than his Inspire 1.The bottom line is this, each drone is unique in its own way. Do your research and figure out which features work best of you. If you would like to ask specific questions about the Typhoon H, feel free to comment below.</p>

<h5 id="professional-grade-at-a-reasonable-price-with-phenomenal-customer-service">Professional Grade at a reasonable price with Phenomenal Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Professional Grade Hexacopter at a reasonable price.All I can say is WOW! I bought the Typhoon H as addition to my Yuneec Q500 4K. The Typhoon H perform more than expected. It is really stable even in high winds. It is really agile when you need it to be. The camera is comparable to the $2K models. I have flown this over water at 2,000ft out (horizontallly) at 200ft up. it slices through the air as if there was no air. it produced a smooth video and really steady when taking stills. I have also flown this it freezing temperatures and it flew ok.The battery:The battery can take up to 2 hours to charge on the standard charger. Slow charging and slow balancing is good if you ask me. I get at least 19mins+ on the battery by not making complex maneuvers. aggressive maneuvering gives me 16mins. not bad. I have a total of 6 batteries. I just make sure that I cycle through the batteries to get the even use on each one of them.The CGO3+:The camera is good. It can take 360 photos, Timelapse, and 180 panorama. There is the trim function that can make the H drone on a straight line and you can concentrate on the camera movements. Also the camera can do preset flying such as journey, orbit, curve cable cam etc. The 4K feature is the best. Just make sure you have a powerful computer to edit the footages. if not, you can insert the micro sd in you sd card slot on your 4K tv. be prepared to see the high quality video and pictures.The Typhoon H:The H is an excellent build. The fold up arms and snap on propellers are great features. I am still on my original propellers. Also, the feature of switching the indicator lights is great when you take night photography. no glare from the lights. I would fly my H at 2,500ft out and hit the return to home and concentrate on the camera panning. it gives you a smoother fly (constant speed) while to pan and tilt the camera. The redundancy feature is great. if one motor fails or hit a big bug in the air, it will still fly and you can land it safely. a video on youtube also showed a two motor fail and yet, the H was able to land safely. a quadcopter will plunge into the ground when it loses a propeller or a motor fail. very dangerous if you fly on top of a crowd or tall buildings. The H is better than the Quadcopter.The Micro SD Card:The H can read and write on a 128GB micro sd. just make sure you have the class 10 U1 or U3.The ST16 Controller:The controller is built just right. the size is ok and it does not feel like a toy. There is a playback feature on the ST16 which is a bonus. Charging is not favorable because it takes at least 8hours to charge. but dont let that affect your decision in buying one. 1 full charge will give you at least 12 flights, or 12 full batteries. I also use a portable battery to charge it on the field or charge it while in use using a micro usb cable provided.Customer Service:This is one of the highlights on this review. Customer Service is Phenomenal. Very respectful and very attentive. Real Person. They will work with you and they are not rude like DJi.Overall:I highly recommend this drone for first time buyers and advance-professional users. This will not disappoint you. It takes professional videos and pictures. it is steady in the air making you think it is sitting on a tripod. Do not compare this to Mavic or Breeze. This is designed to take professional videos and photos. For the price, it is money well spent.</p>
