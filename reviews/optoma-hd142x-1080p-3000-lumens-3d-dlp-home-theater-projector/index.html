<h5 id="best-bang-for-the-buck">Best bang for the buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having had a background in sales for A/V equipment, as well as the installation of them, I have seen top shelf quality products as well as equipment that doesn&rsquo;t quite meet my high expectations. With this projector I was skeptical because the price was so low but the features were on par with what I was looking for, so I took a chance. Let me just say my gamble paid off big time! This projector exceeds my expectations and looks magnificent. The blacks are black and the whites are white. Color is suburb and I didn&rsquo;t even have to adjust out of the box which surprised me. I have cable, which is usually not the best when it comes to picture quality because of the feed my cable company provides and yet this projector nails it! My PS4 on blu-ray however is what really blew my mind. The quality of picture was crisp and vibrant, it looks like I should have paid thousands of dollars! Easy to setup and very user friendly I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive projector but wants top quality performance.</p>

<h5 id="it-has-the-best-quality-picture-and-feature-set-for-the-price-range">It has the best quality picture and feature set for the price range &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Optoma HD142X after a ton of research and time spent looking at projectors online. It has the best quality picture and feature set for the price range I was looking for. It really does have an amazing picture. I am currently using it with a 120&rdquo; motorized screen. One of the reasons I went with this model was because of the higher brightness rating. I have it in my living room which has blinds over the windows, but theres still a decent amount of ambient light in the room in the middle of the afternoon. This projector is bright enough that it looks just as good as my LCD during the day.Another nice feature of this projector is the 12v trigger port. Alot of projectors dont include this often overlooked feature. It allows you to automate your electric screen. By wiring the 12v trigger to the control box of my screen, I now have my screen automatically lowered when I turn on the projector. When I turn it off, the screen automatically goes back up.Overall, Im very satisfied with the overall quality of this projector. It was very easy to tune and set up. The vast array of options and features make this one of the best, if not, the best budget home theatre projector with a full 1080p native resolution.UPDATE: So Ive had this projector for a few months now and can say Im still just as happy as the day I got it. I use it daily for watching TV and occasional video games. Everyone who comes over cant believe how great it looks! Ive found that I really appreciate the backlit remote at night as it helps to find the keys. I also expected that it might start to get louder over time as dust built up inside, but it still runs quiet as ever. I sit right in front of it and dont even notice the sound even after watching tv nearly all day sometimes.</p>

<p>Excellent product so far !Will write detail review soon!update 8/10/16This is my second ever projector and-and my previous projector was from optima as well about 4 years backI bought this after my earlier projector lens just melted while running continuously for hours. I am quite a heavy user of projector about 6 to 7 hrs every day. My last projector lasted me 4 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years with almost daily use and one lamp replacement. the replacement seems to have played roles in extra heat and melting bossiness of lens ( not Lamp !)I was again in the market looking for a projector and obviously looked for another optimum as It really worked well for me before. In this price range $600 there are not many choices if you are looking for configuration of native HD, 3D capable and 3000+ lumens. I have used other brands( Epson, dell )as part of my job and have nothing against it but I still like optima of the whole package ad the price point.Now this projectorRecently released model that didn&rsquo;t deter me from buying as I feel ok by optima alreadyNice packing by optima and then by amazon which made safe delivery possible.Picture quality is amazing on online HD videos, of movies , TVshows and things from hard diskDecent speaker on it can be used occasionally but would need better speaker if watching moviesapprox 100 inches from 10 feetenough lumens for daytime viewing ,I have a lot of windows with some shades on , much better in ambient lights and in dark .2 HDMI , one with MHL, Audio outExcellent color reproduction , mamboing contrast , do very well in dark scenes.Blacklist remote ( new for me )Minimal fan noise3 D works really well , Watched Avatar from my hard disk , the world well with my DLP glasses( bought 4 years ago ) , Lot of 3 D options in many DLP /Vesa /2D to 3D. First time for to use #D on projector , was amazed at the qualityThins that could be betterRemotely is not very responsivemy last Optoma came with carrying cover/bag free of costwill update more later</p>

<h5 id="bare-bones-projector-but-a-really-good-value">Bare-bones projector but a really good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So after days of bouncing between Epson, BenQ, and Optoma projectors I went with this entry level Optoma.PROS:- Low entry price for first time home projector- HDMI- Picture quality is greatCONS:- If you have multiple devices running into the projector via an Audio receiver (say, a Blu ray player and a Xbox), if you switch devices (say, stop watching a Blu Ray and turn on Xbox), the Projector starts displaying weird Red and green lines. I have to switch from HDMI Input 1 to HDMI Input 2. Then I switch back to Input 1 and the lines are gone. Seems the Projector doesnt like when you switch devices that are on a shared input.- Turns out I am sensitive to the Rainbow Effect (some people seem Red/Green/Blue colors when white text is on a black background if a DLP projector is used). Not bad enough to return it since I would have to get a LCD projector as all DLPs have this issue.I like this projector - its bare-bones but for my first projector I like it. I will get about 5 years out of it before I look into projectors above $1000.If your budget is around $500 this is the one to get</p>
