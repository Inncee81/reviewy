<h5 id="great-little-camera">Great little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great picture quality, I have the GoPro Hero 3 and this one and neither one have a great interface however this is easy to use. I was really worried that I would have to mount it upside down and then rotate every one of my quad videos in post however if you connect it to the wifi app and rotate it it will stay rotated outside of the app which is great for being able to mount it button side down and still access them easily. One of the downfalls is that it does not come with a gopro mount which I thought it did. I mounted it to a rubber mechanical gimbal via velcro and it has already popped off three times during a rough landing and has survived all of them. The other drawback is that while it does have a mini lens hood it does not have an optional glass filter so the lens is braving all of the elements on it&rsquo;s own. As far as the wifi connection it doesn&rsquo;t have much range but no wifi does, however when in that range it works great. I think the GoPro 3 does have a slightly better image quality but they are both comparable and great and if you only owned one of them you would be happy either way although I get the impression this one can take a bit more of a hit caseless than the GoPro. It is slim, lightweight and works great-I thought I would use it for FPV however I have since bought board cams so I never had the opportunity to test out the latency but there are tons of youtube videos out there-I use mine for on board recording and sending my big 450mm up for aerials although I am much more into 250&rsquo;s racers at the moments so it occasionally goes along for the ride on them. As a side note I did dump an xk x350 on it&rsquo;s back at incredibly high speed (for those unfamiliar that is a very powerful inverted flyer) with the runcam attached and it is still going strong.</p>

<h5 id="look-out-gopro-there-is-a-new-cam-in-town">LOOK OUT GOPRO. THERE IS A NEW CAM IN TOWN.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU CAN&rsquo;T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE. Very nice go cam. I got this for my 250 drone. Wow it&rsquo;s what I have been looking for with Wifi and good battery life. not sure of how long but it lasted most of the morning I tested it. the video is up there with the more pricey ones. I&rsquo;m very happy with this unit. It&rsquo;s 49grams with the battery. It fits nicely on the drone. The latency is low like they say. The app work very well with it too. all in all 5 out of 5 for me&hellip; nice job RUN CAM.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-impressed-with-runcam">Very impressed with Runcam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The good:- Full HD, rivals GoPro!- Weight and size- Comes with a matching mount that can be zippy-tied to your frame / gimbal- Comes with many cables, including a composite video out (piping mine straight to a 600mw VTX!)The bad:- If it&rsquo;s unplugged from a USB, even after &ldquo;eject&rdquo;ing, the cam locks up and the battery removed to get it back- If running solely on external power (no battery, as an FPV cam), will lose the video files when power is cut if it isn&rsquo;t first turned off using the power button- WiFi range sucks. Do yourself a favor and get a 5.8GHz transmitter/receiver to use this as an FPV cam</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-for-my-miniquad-i-needed-to-adjust-the-focus">Works well for my miniquad, I needed to adjust the focus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better form factor than a gopro or Yi for miniquads. Bitrate is good, but firmware is not config customizable. Only complaint I have is the lens is not focused for distance (the intended use of this cam) , but this seems to be common among most Chinese manufactured action cams. Be ready to take out 6 small screws, take a razor blade to the adhesive around the lens screw and take some sample video/photos with the lens twisted to different locations. A small mark with a sharpie helps keep track of the best focus location while testing. I turned my lens about 20 degrees clockwise to get good distance focus. Color saturation is high, but I like the results. All these cams are pretty good at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera-for-drones-or-had-cam">Great camera for drones, or had cam.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great camera, but I knew what I was buying when I picked this up.Pro:- Great video- live feed via wifiCons:- You CANNOT use it as a static camera with no airflow, it will overheat. This means you can&rsquo;t use it as a dash cam. Though it will work as a hat cam.- Wifi/app is a little finicky. Sometimes crashes so it&rsquo;s not reliable for starting/stopping recording. But you can set this via buttons- Still lacks the robust settings that already exist and that many other camera companies have. They just haven&rsquo;t added it to the app.</p>

<h5 id="runcam2-review">RunCam2 Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am reviewing the RunCam2. There are several neat things about this camera. But I&rsquo;m checking it for its video quality, sound quality, and the app that comes with it.When I watched the videos I recorded, I was blown away by the quality. The video quality is exquisite, as well as adjustable. It&rsquo;s 1080p by 60p, and the frame can be changed in the app, more on that later. This camera is also capable of slo-mo, and it seems to be good on that too. There doesnâ€™t seem to be any faults in the motion of the camera as well. The range of peripheral is 120 degrees, which is pretty nice. Video quality all in all is amazing.Looking back at the videos, the audio quality is odd, but I think it was just the way I used it. My voice sounded obnoxiously loud compared to other people; and the people sounded kinda quiet, but I believe that can be fixed with the editing software. The sound of vehicles seem to be just about the way you would hear it normally. Wind seems to be an obstacle. If all else fails with figuring out the audio, I would just buy a new mic and crop and replace the audio from the camera.The RunCam app is pretty handy, as well as required to even record or take pictures with the camera itself. This is also the place where you can switch quality/frame of the videos, filters, slo-mo, etc. You could also watch the videos you make and delete some for space to make more videos.On a side note, a SD chip is required to save the footage you make. Also, the battery lasts around an hour. I recommend buying spare batteries or carrying mobile chargers if you plan on recording for much longer than an hour.All in all, I enjoy this camera a lot, and Iâ€™m still exploring the features.</p>
