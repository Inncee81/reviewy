<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Add up to 4 peripherals quickly and easily with the Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub. The thin, lightweight design makes this hub a great travel companion to expand one USB 3.0 port into four. Especially great for notebooks which come with only a few ports in an era when you need to attach many USB devices at once, such as a printer, card reader, cell phone, iPod, thumb drive, mouse, keyboard, or an external hard drive. Fully backwards compatible with the USB 2.0/1.1 products. Plus, each port has its own separate power switch so you can control each port independently. </p>

<p>Expand your high speed USB 3.0 ports 
Technology seems to advance at ever increasing speeds. With the recent release of SuperSpeed USB 3.0, you can now transfer data at up to 10 times the speeds of the older USB 2.0 standards! Speeds of 5Gbps are a vast improvement over USB 2.0 that only supports up to 480Mbps. The Sabrent USB 3.0 Hub is a great tool to expand a single USB 3.0 port into 4 ports, so now you can connect all of your USB devices at one time. Plus, its small and elegant design has been configured to be as thin as possible so as to not take up precious space as you travel. Yet, it is still backward compatible with your older devices, so you can still use it in conjunction with USB 2.0 devices. </p>

<p>System Requirements: 
Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 
Mac OS X </p>

<p>Please Note:
2.4Ghz wireless devices, such as wireless keyboard and mouse adapters, may not work in close proximity to USB 3.0 devices or hubs. Connecting to a USB 2.0 port is recommended.</p>

<p>For a stable connection, the devices connected to the 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub must not exceed a combined current of 5 volts 900 mAh. External hard-drives should be connected to an external power source. This 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub will not charge an iPad (it will only sync).</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="should-be-a-5-star-product-but-one-massive-defect-makes-it-useless">Should be a 5-Star product, but one MASSIVE defect makes it useless.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me begin this review by saying that I want to give this product five stars. It is truly an excellent little USB Hub and I am beyond impressed by its performance and speed for the price.There is, however, one critical flaw in my particular hub that based on other reviews is a fairly common problem, and that is if the cord moves even the slightest bit, it momentarily interrupts the flow of data/power, causing all devices to be disconnected. As a producer who was hoping to use this hub in my home studio and for live performances, this is absolutely unacceptable as I cannot have my midi controllers, audio interface, and hard drive disconnected in the middle of writing or, worse yet, in the middle of a live set!I have never had USB connection issues with my laptop before, so I have become truly frustrated with this connectivity issue. Like I said, this BY ALL MEANS should be a 5-Star product, but the connectivity defect has rendered this hub entirely useless for me.I suppose the only bright side is that I am now in need of more that four ports, and have been looking to upgrade to a powered hub anyways, but because of this defect, I am seriously questioning whether or not to buy it from Sabrent.CONCLUSION: Good product IN THEORY.BUT disconnects when moved even slightly.Many people have had zero issues. It&rsquo;s your gamble.</p>

<h5 id="performance-great-design-is-not-adequate">Performance great, design is not adequate.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Longest time used before this review:Less than 90 daysDevices that this Hub plugged into:Samsung RV511(Windows7), GPD Win(Windows10), GPD XD(Android 4.4)Devices plugged into this hub:Transcend Card readers various,Rocketek Card reader, Western Digital Elements External HDD, Sony PSP 3K, iClever foldable keyboard.Almost 90 days of use it has been an ok experience. been using this in my daily carry PC Bag.Performance wise, read &amp; write is acceptable between high class SDcards to computer.Design wise, don&rsquo;t like that the ports are really close together horizontal side by side. i can only plug in 2 devices at a time due to design without additional cables. mainly due to design of other devices. in effect to use all 4 ports i&rsquo;d need additional cables. i don&rsquo;t want to daily carry additional cables specifically USB-A(f) to USB-A(m).all in all have considered replacing this one with another that has the ports on top each other with a little space between them hopefully with on/off switch and is as small like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-but-not-on-my-car-s-stereo">Works great but not on my car&rsquo;s stereo.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased mine hoping to use it the to switch between USB drives but this does NOT work with the 2012 Toyota Camry Display Audio. I have three USB 3.0 sticks that work fine without the hub. However, my stereo would not recognize them when plugged into this hub.On the bright side, it works as it was designed on my desktop. I won&rsquo;t fault the product for not working on a USB 2.0 car connection. I&rsquo;ll keep this one and buy a USB 2.0 that is designed similarly.Edit - I recently replaced the stock Toyota stereo with an Advent. The USB switch works as designed with the new stereo. Remember to deactivate the current USB stick before switching to the desired one.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-not-something-i-m-loving-or-would-recommend-to-a-friend-in-a-heartbeat">&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m loving or would recommend to a friend in a heartbeat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason this doesn&rsquo;t get 4 or 5 stars in my book is as follows:The device works as advertised, but it isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;5 star product.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m loving or would recommend to a friend in a heartbeat. It&rsquo;s a good product that does its job, but it is not the best.My criticism of it is that the LEDs are not very bright, and the LED on the right most slot bleeds light over to the 3rd slots. That is one of my biggest pet peeves. Also, it&rsquo;s made of plastic and feels cheap. I would have preferred if it were made out of something more durable, but I guess that&rsquo;s me not really knowing what product I was signing up to buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-2-5-months-see-update-they-sent-a-new-one">worked for 2.5 months&hellip;. see update, they sent a new one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the hub for 2.5 months. Up until now, I really liked it. It started acting up where your turn on a port and the light comes on but it is not connected. If I disconnect the hub from the computer and connect and then turn on the port then it works. Unfortunately I can not exchange it. I have not tossed it in the trash yet but I am getting pretty closeupdate:I wrote to one of the customer service people who wrote to someone else who had a problem and he sent me a new one. It came today. I will up it one star for great customer service and see how the new device performs. If the new one has no problem then I will give them 5 starts as they will have desirved it.By the way, customer service reached out to me independently of my writing to them. This is a company that wants stands behind their product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-more-switching-usb-cables-around">No more switching USB cables around.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product feels much sturdier than I would have expected for the cost.The lights on the buttons look awesome and shine blue when that port is on, but the light bleeds through a bit so it can be hard to tell which are on.Fortunately the buttons feel well constructed and it&rsquo;s easy to tell which ports are powered with a quick touch.I originally purchased this just for my PC, but I bought another for the bedroom. If you find yourself switching out USB devices frequently this product is for you.I&rsquo;m not sure how well this hub transfers data. I use it for charging my phone, headphones, watch, and other items simultaneously at my desk or computer.</p>
