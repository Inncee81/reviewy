<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="from-a-loyal-cah-fan-this-game-gives-it-a-run-for-its-money">From a loyal CAH fan, this game gives it a run for its money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent party game that rivals cards against humanity. Let me start off by saying I&rsquo;m a huge CAH enthusiast, bigger blacker box, 6 expansions, all the bells and whistles.Beware:This game feels identical to the raunchy behavior that takes place in these 17+ card games. While the game can be fun to any random group of people, playing with close friends is really where it shines. The game forces people to make rash opinions about the people playing the game, and can potentially even hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings by something like voting who would tip the least, most likely to date someone not yet born etc. While most cards are generally positive, you should make sure everyone playing can take a hit and realizes that it is just a game.With random strangers it is a lot harder to vote for someone you barely know opposed to those you know well. However playing with a group of close friends, it really shines as it promotes sharing the reasoning behind the vote, let it be a kind gesture someone witnessed or that one night where things went a little hazy.It is super compact, I like how easy it easy to bring a square box with me over the BBB. Less clutter than CAH because there isn&rsquo;t a discard pile since all voting cards are returned to the players.Since this game is propelled by the players&rsquo; opinions instead of a funny word or phrase on a card, the jokes and memories created by playing feel more original and genuine, at least that what I perceived.Nice addition to my collection of party games, would buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-times">Good times!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun game. The Voting Game is different than Cards Against Humanity as it focuses on the player&rsquo;s opinion&rsquo;s of each other. Super simple game and you can alter the rules to fit the setting of your night. Playing this game can be a minefield, however the best way to play this game is to have no shame with who you vote for. I&rsquo;d advise to play this game with friends who don&rsquo;t take themselves too seriously as some of the questions can be insulting or embarrassing. Overall, this is a great game and if you and your friends can laugh at yourselves then this is the perfect addition to any game night.The only unfortunate thing about the game is that I am unable to order the expansion packs as they do not ship to Japan. Regardless, this game deserves 5 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-game-was-a-lot-of-fun-it-had-us-laughing-the-whole-time">This game was a lot of fun it had us laughing the whole time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This game was a lot of fun it had us laughing the whole time! It&rsquo;s no cards agains humanity but it was still a lot of fun if you&rsquo;re looking for something different. Some of the cards are a little bit mean spirited. My husband and I had party with some close friends and we went through the deck beforehand and pulled out a few cards that we thought were a little too mean or might be create an awkward situation. I&rsquo;d recommend only playing with people you know really well and with people who have a good sense of humor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="surprisingly-great-game">Surprisingly Great Game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly great game. This game is very simple. It consist of 2 decks. The voting deck and the statement. Everyone gets assigned a number and then everyone is given number cards of everyone in the game except there own. The statement card is drawn and everyone anonymously place the number of who they thing most resembles the card. Then whoever is voted on gets one guess at who voted for them. Amazingly simple and fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="play-with-caution">Play with Caution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun game, quick/easy to play, simple to set up, &amp; it takes very little effort to play. Please note though, this is an &ldquo;ADULT&rdquo; Party game. Parents wanting to play with their family (young adult children included) should know some of the questions asked are sexual &amp; might not be appropriate for a family game night. The same could be said for other group settings, so be aware.Since we were familiar with the game, we did play with our young adult children, but just went through the deck of question cards prior to playing &amp; removed them from the deck (as a matter of fact I threw them away bc some of the questions would not be appropriate for most of our group play - I felt it could be awkward). As long as you are aware of the content, this is a great game.They need to make a few G Rated versions - not necessarily a kid version, just a version any adult group can play.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-love-playing-cards-against-humanity">We love playing cards against humanity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love playing cards against humanity. This game is just as great but more personal! The cards vary from adult themed to every day things but the voting being directly related to the people your with is so much fun! You really find out a lot about your friends and family. We absolutely love this game! I am definitely going to be buying this for gifts in the future. My brother loved it so much, he already bought all the expansion packs haha.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mostly-good">Mostly good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like that this game is a different flavor that CAH, and that the concept is not the same. However, I don&rsquo;t think I would say that this game is quite as inappropriate, even though some of the cards are close. I had a blast playing this game with my friends. My only half complaint is that given the object of the game, the amount of cards that are included is small. It isn&rsquo;t the type of game that remains fun after repeating cards. Good thing there are expansion packs available. Enjoyed the game still!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun">Fun!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun game for a night with friends! If you guys are like me and my friends get the NSFW one. This one was fun, but some cards were too G rated for us lol</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wondering-how-this-game-is-fun">Wondering how this game is fun</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is no CAH. I played this once with a group of friends, while inebriated, so our expectations were already low.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-group-game-that-is-easy-to-understand-and-super">This is a great group game that is easy to understand and super &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are game addicts! This is a great group game that is easy to understand and super entertaining.</p>

<p>fun with fun friends</p>

<h5 id="great-family-game">Great family game!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So much fun!! My family loves this game!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-funny-at-times">It is funny at times</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to buy the nsfw pack for the more adult questions. It is funny at times.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great game- had everyone laughing and even having to clarify their answers which made it 100x funnier</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-much-fun-my-friends-and-i-laughed-and-learned-new">So much fun. My friends and I laughed and learned new &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So much fun. My friends and I laughed and learned new things about each other. I&rsquo;m ordering the expansion pack</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great game, easy to take everywhere! Great way to meet people</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didn-t-love-the-game">Didn&rsquo;t love the game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t love the game. Would be more fun with 6-8 people that everyone knows well, and we don&rsquo;t have gatherings of that size usually. Has potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="our-group-had-a-pretty-good-idea-as-to-who-would-end-up-in">our group had a pretty good idea as to who would end up in &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>By the end of this game&hellip; our group had a pretty good idea as to who would end up in Heaven and who wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;Lots of fun. The more the merrier.</p>
