<h5 id="easily-crushes-ice-and-blends-easily">easily crushes ice and blends easily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered for a gift for someone who makes daily smoothies and blends fruit and vegetables often. Reports that it is very impressive, easily crushes ice and blends easily. A very well made and quality item. I am well pleased with this brand and model and would heartily recommend for smothies, food processing, and making mixed drinks with crushed ice. it&rsquo;s good for grinding all spices too.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-was-very-happy-that-i-decided-to-order-this-blender-set">I was very happy that I decided to order this blender set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very happy that I decided to order this blender set. First of all I was very impressed and how quickly it was shipped to my home and that it was wonderfully package were no damage happened to it whatsoever. When unpacking The box I could really tell the quality of the set. The base portion of the splendor has a nice weight to it plus it has little small suction cups at the bottom to help keep it in place. The set comes with a total of 3 cups two of them are 32 ounces and the other one is 24 answers. These are bigger than the typical size cups that come with a smoothie maker. The blade or should I say blades that come with this set is nice as well because it’s like three blades built into one so when you’re crushing up ice it pulverizes it nicely. This smoothie maker is perfect for chopping up frozen fruit ice cubes and yogurt to make the perfect smoothie. It is very easy to clean up because it comes with the cleaning brush but all you need to do is really rent out your cup put a teeny bit of water and soap and blend it for a few seconds and that’ll clean it up nicely just rinse it out with water. This would make a awesome gift where the person would really appreciateREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-cosori-professional-high-speed-blender-works-great-it-is-as-supposed-to-do">This Cosori Professional High-Speed Blender works great it is as supposed to do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Cosori Professional High-Speed Blender works great it is as supposed to do.I had a few times of struggle to figure it out how to use it and how I can make smoothies out well with this blenderFollowed the instructions, I poured some liquid stuff on the bottom first, start with a little bit of liquid and then add more until to get to the point what I like it.if you put liquids ingredient on the bottom and smaller ingredients in the middle, large ingredient next and ice on the top, that would make you healthy, favorable smoothies on your hand.there are lots of option you can make with this, you can make a sauce, guacamole, dressings, cocktail, smoothies., lots of things.The base is strong and heavy and Suction cups under the blender makes it stand firmly on the counter.Make healthy smoothies at home!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-blender-read-my-review-for-all-the-reasons-why">Love this blender, read my review for all the reasons why.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All I can say is, wow, this is much better than I expected. We go through a lot of smoothies in my house and I really wanted one that would do a good job with ice. Some of the smoothie blenders that I have tried in the past don&rsquo;t do a very good job with ice and they leave a lot of lumps. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a &ldquo;smoothie&rdquo; blender. Before I even tried it out, one of the things I was the most impressed with was how heavy the base is. This tells me that there is very clearly a good solid motor on this unit. I also really love the fact that there&rsquo;s rubber suction cup feet on the base to help it stick to the countertop and not slide around. This particular blender also comes with a number of accessories that turn out to be quite useful. It makes it easy to take a smoothie on the go or even to save leftover smoothie in the fridge for a bit. Another feature that I wasn&rsquo;t quite expecting is the capacity of the containers, it&rsquo;s actually substantially larger than other smoothie blenders I&rsquo;ve had in the past. This means that it&rsquo;s easy to make a double smoothie to share with someone else in the family. Finally, this particular unit does actually do a great job of blending ingredients into a nice smooth mixture, including ice. I&rsquo;m quite happy with this and have put it on the countertop and stored away my other blender that just doesn&rsquo;t perform anywhere near as well. This is now my go-to smoothie blender and the other is a backup.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-product-blend-well-works-better-than-expected">Great product, blend well, works better than expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing blender, i have had a ninja blender that served me well. my ninja stopped working and i wanted to give cosori blender a shot, it blends very well, i will be attaching a sample of crushed ice. The auto blend feature is a great addition to the blender, i tried to see how it will blend ice, the blender did not disappoint. i just hope it last me for a while. If somehow the company stand behind the product and add some sort of warranty this product will be a winner.Edit: i made a video but somehow amazon does not like the video so its not letting me add it but here are some picturesREAD MORE</p>
