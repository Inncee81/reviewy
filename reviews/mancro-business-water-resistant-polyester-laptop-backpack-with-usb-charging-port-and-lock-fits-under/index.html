<h5 id="great-backpack-for-travel-carries-a-lot-but-has-a-compact-design">Great backpack for travel, carries a lot but has a compact design!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great backpack for travel. I can comfortably fit my 15&rdquo; laptop, water bottle, small pair of flat shoes, a course reader and a bunch of other little things (agenda, ipad, journal, pens and pencils, iphone.) Really an awesome backpack that looks professional, clean and holds a LOT. I use it for my frequent travel (airplane) and it fits perfectly under the seat.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-am-very-disappointed-first-day-i-am-using-this-and-the-zipper">I am very disappointed first day I am using this and the zipper &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very disappointed first day I am using this and the zipper is broken - perfect size but I am disappointed in the quality and hope I can return itI am updating this review as the seller has contacted me and is doing everything they can to make it right - that is customer service and I may re purchase this product as they are so helpfulMay 2017- UPDATE- I am using a newer version of the bag and the zipper has been MUCH IMPROVED. I cannot say enough about the seller and their commitment to customer service. They took the feedback about the zipper and fixed it - GREAT JOB love this backpackREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="fair-comfortable-to-wear-with-20-lbs-stuffed-inside">Fair comfortable to wear with 20+ lbs stuffed inside</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually waterproof! I&rsquo;ve walked for 20+ minutes in rain with this on my back a few times, to find that nothing inside was even slightly damp. Fair comfortable to wear with 20+ lbs stuffed inside. Great organization setup. Would buy again.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="fairly-comfortable-multiple-compartments-fit-both-my-14">Fairly comfortable, multiple compartments fit both my 14</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fairly comfortable, multiple compartments fit both my 14.1&rdquo; laptop and 10&rdquo; tablet pc, with chargers and other gears like hdmi cables, flash drives, etc. I live in an area where summer temperature easily goes over 95, so can&rsquo;t say much about the mesh- I&rsquo;d sweat with any backpack.. But the straps are sturdy enough to hold up the weight of my books, laptops, stationeries and water bottle, so that&rsquo;s great! I like the front little pocket to put things I could easily grab, like keys or earphones - things I&rsquo;d need to reach while on the go with things in my hands already.I have not had a chance to try out the usb port for the portable battery (not included), but I do think is a cool feature and is one of the reasons why I bought this bag.The lock that comes with the backpack works fine, haven&rsquo;t had a reason to put it to use yet; I figured it&rsquo;d be more useful in situations like travelling or having to leave your backpack in a public library while you go to the bathroom or something. But hey, free lock- use it for your gym locker if need be.All in all, a great, sturdy backpack with lots of different pockets in different sizes to make compartmentalizing your iteams fairly easy and convenient. Just what I needed!READ MORE</p>

<p>Carried this around the bahamas. It was splashed by pools and hottubs. Also carried through the rain in florida. A drink was also spilled on it. The laptop and tablet inside it were both protected and dry.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the bag I love everything about it, the only problem is that the USB dosnt work,yes I did plug it in, yes I did have a portable charger. This is the main reason why I bought the bag&hellip;..for the USB&hellip;&hellip;.I would of bought something els if it wasn&rsquo;t for that&hellip;..could you plz do something about it?!!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="overall-i-m-pleased">overall i&rsquo;m pleased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good pack though a little small. Fits the body well. Comfortable straps. The USB cord is useless. The interior connector is what goes in the base, not the device that needs charging so you have to have a converter then need a second cord to connect the backpack to the wall unit.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-spacious-and-moslty-without-flaws">Comfortable, spacious and moslty without flaws.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does what it says. Have been using it for university everyday, and can fit my 13 inch laptop, it&rsquo;s charger, a tablet, calculator, a raincoat and my water bottle in it comfortably. Can squeeze in my keyboard without too much trouble. Comfortable to wear, and has been used in the rain without any leakage or issues.The USB cable that comes with the bag, attached to the USB port on the outside, is really flimsy and I&rsquo;m sure will snap or break long before the bag itself needs to be replaced. I don&rsquo;t use it at all though, so no complaints. If I were to use it regularly, would dock one star from the review.READ MORE</p>

<p>Good backpack, but a little small. It&rsquo;s comfortable and sometimes and the quality of the materials is good, not too cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-laptop-bag">Perfect Laptop bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve only had this backpack for a few days. So my review will be based on initial thoughts not durability, because I’d have to carry this thing around a lot longer to make that&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="the-best-bag">The best bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this bag. Such a great investment for anyone that loves compartments like I do. I carry a lot and it’s well padded for your back. The color is pretty! Glad I brought it</p>
