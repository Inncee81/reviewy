<h5 id="great-projector-amazing-picture-max-bang-for-your-buck">Great projector. Amazing picture. Max bang for your buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At 22+ feet, projecting an 8 foot by 14.5 foot picture outdoors at night, the picture is so clear that I can see the individual pixels clearly. The picture quality is unreal with this projector. I got it to build what amounts to an outdoor theater in my backyard for a big football game broadcast. While we lost, the projector (and the picture it threw) was a HUGE hit. I bought a 35 foot HDMI cable and an HDMI splitter and split the signal out of my cable box so I could show it in the den and outside at the same time. Instead of spending a ton of money on a screen, I went to a local sign supplier and bought four sheets of 4 mil corroplast (corrugated plastic that signs are printed on) and constructed an 8 x 16 foot screen in my back yard. Now NO ONE I know has anything even close to my media setup! Can&rsquo;t wait for the NCAA Playoffs and Superbowl now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="value-and-performance">Value and performance.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This my first [personal] projector projector ever. I am IT support for a business that sometimes requires projectors so i do have a bit more technical insight than some other folks. I&rsquo;m also a home theater enthusiast, but by no means, an expert.Compared to most business projectors here are a few things that I noticed immediately.Size: It&rsquo;s quite small. Compared to the projectors I have at work, The HD141X is small and light.Design: I picked up the Glossy Black projector on sale. While i would have preferred a white one, it was also $100 more. Being the bargain hunter that I am, I couldn&rsquo;t justify spending an additional hundred dollars on color. Before i received the projector, i thought this was going to be a problem. My ceiling is white and i was afraid this would be a sore on my home&rsquo;s aesthetic. The size and design sure did prove me wrong. My wife was convinced she didn&rsquo;t want a black projector on the ceiling, but once it was installed, it actually looks nice.Performance: It&rsquo;s great. Any projector near this price point will not look as good as this one. It displays 1080p. One thing to look out for when purchasing a projector is a &ldquo;support&rdquo; and &ldquo;display&rdquo; resolution. A lot of projectors will support 1080p, but will not display 1080 ie they will scale the image. The HD141X is the best 1080p projector at it&rsquo;s price point.Now from the prospective of a professional projector, the brightness is less than stellar. Don&rsquo;t plan on using this in a bright room. In a dark room, however, the image is stunning.And the fan&hellip; It can really ramp up at times. It may even become distracting during quiet scenes. I usually listen with the volume high enough to drain out the noise.Despite the two critical items, i&rsquo;ve decided to give this a 5 Star review for the price to performance. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to any of my friends and family.It&rsquo;s currently displaying at 120&rdquo; from about 14&rsquo; away.</p>

<h5 id="great-projector-and-great-price">Great projector and great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector is great! This was my first projector and I am super happy with it! The image quality is great, I have no regrets with this purchase. I purchased the QualGear PRB-717-BLK Universal Ceiling Mount and the Homegear 120&rdquo; Manual 16:9 Projector Screen and the combination works great together!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-unit-for-the-price-3d-is-truly-amazing">Outstanding unit for the price. 3D is truly amazing!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted a video projector since I was a kid, but I never thought I&rsquo;d really have the space for one, nor the budget. With costs in the thousands of dollars for anything decent about 15 years ago, I assumed that would be the price range for anything with quality. I was wrong.After careful research, and much to my surprise (cost of units), I narrowed it down to the Optoma and Epson. Reading through countless testimonies of pros/cons for each, I felt this would be the best unit for the money. Not to mention, the price of replacing the bulb would be much less as well.Unit arrived as promised. Basic setup instructions, CD (didn&rsquo;t work for some reason), and remote. Of course, I had to purchase a screen for displaying the unit on, so I went with the VonHaus 100&rdquo; manual VonHaus 100-inch Widescreen Projector Screen (Manual Pull Down) - 16:9 Aspect Ratio Projection Screen  I also needed a good quality LONG HDMI cable, so I went with MediaBridge&rsquo;s 35 foot cable Mediabridge ULTRA Series HDMI Cable (35 Feet) - High-Speed Supports 4K, Ethernet, 3D and Audio Return [Newest Standard] - (Part# 91-02X-35B )Routed everything through my Yamaha RX-V867 receiver Yamaha RX-V867BL 7.2-Channel Home Theater Receiver , and actually set up the projector unit on a table-top stand. With minor tweaking and height adjustment, I was watching movies in no time at all.For an added bonus, this unit displays 3D movies like a charm. Purchased a couple to watch, and was totally blown away! Of course, this required the purchase of some 3D glasses, and decided on using the JmGO&rsquo;s JmGO 2Pcs HGL1 DPL-Link 3D Glasses Rechargeable Active Black for DLP 3D Projector TV and really satisfied with those as well.Picture is bright and clear. With 1080p from Blu-Ray discs, the clarity is astonishing. Having a nice home-theater receiver/system makes the experience even better, and feels like you&rsquo;re watching in a true theater. Can&rsquo;t beat it!The only downside (CONS) to this unit, is the time it takes to tweak it. There are several things to consider as you try to get that &ldquo;perfect&rsquo; display, but you&rsquo;re not going to get the same richness of a back-lit LCD screen TV, so don&rsquo;t go there. I&rsquo;m not saying the colors are off, but they just won&rsquo;t be as rich in some places. If you&rsquo;re wanting that kind of richness, then look at the units that are far more expensive than this one. But, if you&rsquo;re wanting an excellent projector for a great price, then look no further. I think you&rsquo;ll be completely satisfied.PROS: Price &ndash; hard to beat, ease of installation, user-friendly remote, great brightness with clarity, works well with 3D display. Very quiet unit.CONS: Tweaking can be a bit timely, and depends on personal preference. Saturation of reds a bit underdeveloped &ndash; minor tweaking will improve though. Requires two-tap to turn unit off.</p>
