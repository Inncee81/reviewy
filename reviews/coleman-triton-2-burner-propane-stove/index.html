<h5 id="does-anyone-at-coleman-actually-test-these-things">Does anyone at Coleman actually test these things?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camp stove is close to being good for my purposes, but comes up short in one important area. The burners generate a lot of heat, so if you just want to boil water this stove may workout fine. The biggest problem I have with it is on the other end of the spectrum: simmering. The issues are:&gt; It seems like most of what you get from the burner is Ultra High, Super High, Very High, and a small amount of Medium. You don&rsquo;t hit Low, which is a setting I use frequently, until just a teeny bit before you hit Off. So when I&rsquo;m attempting to set the burner to Low, I often end up with Off instead, then I have to perform the lighting sequence again.&gt; The control knob has a fair amount of elasticity, so if I manage to set the burner to low, it self-resets, to some degree back to where it was. This is very frustrating! Because there is so little of the control knob range which is Low, the &ldquo;bounce-back&rdquo; makes it nearly impossible to do this without having to relight.&gt; The stove has a rounded bump near each corner, which serves as feet. Unfortunately, the feet are smooth metal, and so the sometimes HOT stove tends to slide around a lot. I added my own rubber feet, which helps, but due to the design (rounded feet), it&rsquo;s hard to get a lot of contact with the table, so it still slides more than I would like.&gt; I have had no problems with the piezo lighter working, but I don&rsquo;t like the button design. The button must be pushed in, horizontally, with a fair amount of force. However, because the stove likes to slide (see prior bullet point), this requires holding the back with one hand while pressing with the other. If, by chance, you had been cooking something on High, then your attempt to lower the heat accidentally turns the burner off, you will need to restart. If you&rsquo;re not careful where you grab the back of the stove, you could end up cooking your hand, along with dinner. A better design would have been a knob, which you turn, or a lever (or button) which you push DOWN (vertically), instead of their button which you push IN (horizontally).Would I buy it again? No! I&rsquo;ve had many Coleman stoves before and none have had the problems of setting the burner on Low, or with the knob bounce-back, so I know they can do it. This time, though, they didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usually I am a campfire/backcountry stove cook, but my fiancé has not done much backpacking yet so we have been easing him in with car camping. I finally broke down and decided to get a bigger stove than my Jetboil for these trips and I am very happy with this Coleman so far! Easy to set up and use. Only wish there was a better way to carry it than having to opt for the carrying case. Would be nice to have some sort of suitcase-like handle for easier transport. Haven&rsquo;t had any of the flukes I&rsquo;ve read about in some other reviews, would definitely recommend this to others!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stove">Great stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as a Father&rsquo;s Day gift for my husband. He was very happy to receive it and we had the opportunity to use it on a couple different camping trips over the summer. The InstaStart is nice to have and the wind shield works well. It cooked quickly and evenly. I&rsquo;m very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-i-m-satisfied-for-me">so I&rsquo;m satisfied. For me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, no quality issues. I assembled it, ran it for a few minutes, and packed it up. Everything worked the way it should, so I&rsquo;m satisfied. For me, it is basically a &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; for when we lose power due to storms, etc. and it (hopefully) will not see much use! It fits nicely into the Coleman Medium Camp Stove bag (&ldquo;&hellip; for grills up to 21.5 x 14 x 4.8 in.&rdquo;), with room to spare for the extension hose and adapter to use with a 20lb tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-great-working-product">Amazing, great working product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took on first camping trip and it works liked a gem! We had no issues with the push button, although I will say it did take a couple clicks to get the burners to lite - but nothing overly extreme. As any camper should, I would recommend to bring a lighter with you just in case you do have any issues. We look forward to using this for years. Any issues that arise I will be sure to update my review.</p>

<h5 id="nice-upgrade-from-our-old-green-coleman-stove-we-used">Nice upgrade from our old green Coleman stove we used &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice upgrade from our old green Coleman stove we used for 20 years (now donated to the local Cub Scout Pack) nice feature having a spot for the griddle. You do give up some space on the griddle vs. the older stoves but the hotter burners, integrated storage and self ignition make it worth the trade off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="coleman-makes-great">Coleman makes great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this as a back up in case I lose power. This enables me to be able to cook food. I started it to make sure all is well and it performed as expected. Coleman makes great producst</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-stove-with-a-mediocre-igniter">Good stove with a mediocre igniter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it for the first time on a 2 day camping trip &hellip; works exactly as described &hellip; great stove cooks evenly .. powerful flames .. everything you could ask for .. even the wind panels work well &hellip; definitely would have giving it <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> stars &hellip; except the right burner only lit the first 2 times .. now doesn&rsquo;t light with the built in (snap style) igniter .. not a super big deal .. just make sure you bring matches or a lighter with you ..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully a perfect new camping stove! haven&rsquo;t had it opened as of today!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-pleased-but-starter-doesnt-always-work">Very pleased, but starter doesnt always work.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well, when the starter works. Half the time, only one burner will light. Takes 3-4 tries to get them going.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Made camp cooking a dream, fits two standard cast iron pans on top.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-this-item-is-great">So far this item is great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am satisfying with its quality. Does a great job,and maybe a lot more I have recommended to several friend, and they told me they are satisfied after receiving product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>replaces an older coleman, exactly as advertised!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-stove">Nice Stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really neat little camp stove. My wife actually uses it on the patio a lot as she enjoys cooking outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-asked-for-replacement-hopefully-the-next-one-is-better">I asked for replacement hopefully the next one is better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As often the old brand names Coleman for quality is only history, this was very poorly built, the propane tube was so misaligned you could not screw it into the stove.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great stove for cooking at the campsite. Nice and compact, easy to use</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received quickly and works exactly as described.</p>
