<p>Edition:Switch + Neon Red and Blue Joy-Con
Introducing Nintendo Switch, the new home video game system from Nintendo. In addition to providing single and multiplayer thrills at home, the Nintendo Switch system can be taken on the go so players can enjoy a full home console experience anytime, anywhere. The mobility of a handheld is now added to the power of a home gaming system, with unprecedented new play styles brought to life by the two new Joy-Con controllers.</p>

<p>PLAY ANYWHERE</p>

<p>Home Gaming System</p>

<p>At home the main unit rests in the Nintendo Switch dock, which connects the system to the TV and lets you play with family and friends in the comfort of your living room.</p>

<p>On-the-Go</p>

<p>Lift Nintendo Switch from the dock and instantly transition to handheld mode for on-the-go gaming. By sharing Joy-Con, players can go head-to-head while away from home. You can also enjoy the same great games in tabletop mode by using the included stand to prop the system up.</p>

<p>New Play Styles</p>

<p>Remove the detachable Joy-Con from either side of Nintendo Switch for more play styles:</p>

<p>One player can use a Joy-Con in each hand
Two players can each take one
Multiple Joy-Con can be employed by numerous people for a variety of gameplay options (additional Joy-Con sold separately)
Slip a set of Joy-Con into a Joy-Con grip accessory, mirroring a more traditional controller. Or, select an optional Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.
Bring together up to 8 Nintendo Switch systems for local face-to-face multiplayer.</p>

<h5 id="the-pros-cons-and-oks-for-the-switch-hr">The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Switch (HR).</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:_______<strong><em>- Nintendo is pretty spot on regarding the battery life as Zelda got me close to 3 hours before I have to plug it in (6 hours for less power hungry games).- I play before going out on my Samsung television and within 30 seconds I took it out of the dock and put it in my bag. No glitches, no errors, no nothing. By far the coolest thing with the Switch as I play Zelda when I’m in my Uber, exactly where I left off.- The grip is almost the same with the standard Xbox and PlayStation controllers, which I like very much.- Dedicated screenshot button is pretty cool to have as my experience with the PS4 did show how useful is it to make a screenshot at a moment notice (Hopefully, future updates will allow us to capture videos).- Sold frame rate from television to mobile as the mobile’s 720p screen does a great job with color contrast and brightness level.- Setting up a Nintendo account was super-fast and simple.- I found the user interface clean and responsive with your choice of Basic “Black” or “White” interface (I’m assuming we’ll be getting more choices in the future).- Love that the power button immediately sends the device into sleep mode. If something comes up, I can power it down and come back in 30 minutes to turn it on and find that I’m exactly in the same place I was in Zelda before powering it down.- Switching from television to mobile can even occur without pausing as it only takes a couple of seconds for the Switch to recognize the change.- The Joy-Con controllers are impressive as I really admire the advance HD rumble motor. The only hope now is to see what the developers can do with it.- Joy-Cons states a 20-hour battery life and I believe it because I haven’t yet had to charge them. I mainly use the controllers connected to the Switch as the controllers charge with the main console, when they’re connected.- The parent control option I stumble upon is pretty cool as well. You can set time limits, see what games your kid plays, as well as set restrictions (I personally didn’t spend much time in this but it’s something I think you should know).- Pretty intuitive on navigation as you can use any one of the controllers or use the mobile touch screen itself to move around (this only really applies when you’re in the mobile version of “Switch”).- More than a 100 Switch games are in production as FIFA, Mario Kart, Skyrim, Arms, and Splatoon 2 are all going to be coming on the Switch!- USB charging allows portable battery packs (or car charger) as I recommend buying a “Gembonics” battery pack if you’re planning on taking this on a flight.- Even though the dock is made of plastic, it does the job connecting the Switch to the television without any glitches or time buffering.- Was extremely pleased with the sound on this device as its super loud (not much bass but this small issue doesn’t deserve to be on the Con list.)- Gaming experience is exactly as everyone says when playing Zelda.- Unlike the Wii U, the Switch doesn’t feel cheap, the load time is nonexistence, and the design doesn’t look like a child’s play toy.Cons and Oks:</em></strong>____<strong><em>- Higher in graphics, the more power hungry it gets. When you play Zelda and then play some mini games (cow-milking competitions, quickdraw shootouts) and you’ll see the difference in battery life.- Right now the Switch is lacking a lot of basic features that the PS4 and Xbox One already had in place when they launched. (I know Nintendo will update soon).- Low in storage. 32gb is really nothing to create a library of future games. You’ll need a MicroSD upgrade for the long haul.- No media streaming apps (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc.). I expect that this will change soon.- My left Joy-Con did become unresponsive at random times. This is frustrating sometimes as it won’t stay synced to the console wirelessly. I know Nintendo is aware of this and I hope a firmware will fix the issue.- No mobile HDMI output means you can’t plug the Switch into the TV without the dock. This really sucks because if you want to use a television, you have to take the dock where you go. My friends always want to plug the Switch into their TV, when I’m there, but I’m unable to.- The Joy-Cons are something you have to get used to as the buttons are oddly placed as the thumbstick is a way to floppy.- Been told that their is a dead pixel issue roaming around that is destroying the mobile experience. I don&rsquo;t have any dead pixels on mine but it&rsquo;s enough to give you a heads up if you want to buy it.- I also found that the + and – are placed too high on the controller as my thumb can’t reach it.- The kickstand feels weak as I’m always checking to see if it&rsquo;s about to come off.- If the kickstand does come off, your MicroSD card slot will be wide open (better be careful).- Both controllers (Joy and Pro) don’t have a headphone output. I don’t like this at all because when I play my PS4 at night I like to be quiet about it. The Switch will not follow the same example as I was hoping buying the Pro will resolve the issue.- The charging port is on the bottom which means that you can’t use the kickstand as the plug gets in the way.- Found the release buttons to detach the Joy-Con controllers are small and hard to press without pressing other buttons (This might be an issue if you’re in a middle of a game).- No support for Bluetooth headsets (hopefully future firmware will resolve this issue.)- As of now, you can’t transfer your save games to a new console or an SD card. How can we back up our future games?- The included Joy-Con grip will not charge the controllers. I have to remove the grip from the controllers in order to attach it back on the dock to charge.- Taking it in and out of the dock will make your screen scratch. Their isn&rsquo;t a barrier or soft cushioning which makes the screen easily open for marks. I&rsquo;m taping some soft fabric inside the docking station because of this issue (the fabric that you get for cleaning your glasses).- I notice that even when you put the Switch in the dock you still lose battery.- Can’t charge the Joy-Cons while playing in TV mode. You’ll need to buy a Charging Grip, which is around $30.- Nintendo says that most games will require a pay service to play online.- The right analog stick makes my hand a little cramped because of the placement of the stick.- Need to get a screen protector as the dock doesn’t really provide protection as the sides provide no covering for the Switch.- The device feels fragile. This makes me worry every time I put it in my bag with my laptop/books.- The screen is alright but the brightness will destroy the battery if you turn it up high.Bottom Line:</em></strong>_______This has great potential and I honestly can’t wait for the next 3 months. A lot of the issues I hope will be fixed with firmware updates as you have to give Nintendo some time to sort out the bugs. I love the fact that you can take this device anywhere without the use of Wi-Fi. I love the fact that at a moment notice you can detach it from your TV and begin playing it with the mobile screen. I love the fact that the design is something that you can have your friends join in. It’s advanced, fast, and has so much growth coming up.I know right now you’ll be buying this for Zelda because a lot of issues still arise from this device. No apps, power hungry, controller issues, the dock makes the screen open to scratches, low storage are all issues that may prevent you from buying this device. I hate the fact that you need to bring your dock if you want to connect to a TV and the accessories are going to make you put more money down.Overall if you want to play Zelda then you should get it now, otherwise wait for a month (or two) until the firmware updates fix/improve the issues on hand. I like this device a lot and I can see the Switch grow into a great mobile factor that I predict even Sony and Microsoft will try to get on board for their next game console versions. You have to give Nintendo some time to fix out the bugs but gaming experience so far is exactly what they&rsquo;re advertising. If you can just put some old 64 games into the system (StarFox) then, my god, I’ll be in heaven. Verdict: Almost exactly in what Nintendo is advertising in gaming but nothing more.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-concept-and-execution-but-some-cheap-decisions-hurt">Fantastic concept and execution, but some cheap decisions hurt.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would love to give my Switch 5 stars, but I just can&rsquo;t, due to a myriad of issues ranging from overpriced accessories, dubious design decisions clearly intended to encourage consumers to buy things that should be unnecessary as well as some just awfully cheap parts that don&rsquo;t match an otherwise superb quality.Let&rsquo;s start with the good:+ The premise of a home console you can play anywhere is perfectly executed. The Wii U was the Switch&rsquo;s prototype; It showed promise, but it didn&rsquo;t quite deliver. The Switch DELIVERS. Going from TV to handheld and back is seamless and instant, especially if you have a TV that can &ldquo;sync states&rdquo; with devices attached to it. And the battery is big enough for a few hours of Zelda or several of something like Snipperclips or NeoGeo games. (It&rsquo;s not meant to replace the DS as the take-everywhere Nintendo console. So the poor battery life is somewhat forgivable.)+ The screen is very high quality. It is IPS and I found that it doesn&rsquo;t distort colors like some reviews have mentioned (one professional review actually said you should expect poor viewing angles because it&rsquo;s IPS, which just isn&rsquo;t true; IPS are the best LCDs suited for multiple viewing angles). When Netflix comes out or if someone is sitting next to you watching you play or groups playing Snipperclips, etc, everyone will be able to get an excellent view of the screen. No problems with viewing angles. And the color, luminosity and contrast are all superb. 720p is an understandable compromise. If it was 1080p, not only would the screen cost significantly more, but it would need a bigger CPU, GPU, and battery, all which would drive up the price to be exclusive. Nintendo does not want to be an exclusive company. And nothing looks pixelated — though you can see aliasing if you look for it.+ The plastic on the controllers is luxurious. They feel great to the touch. You really need to experience it in person.+ Twin ball-joint thumb sticks on a portable. Need I say more?+ Though the joy-cons are small and seem like they&rsquo;d be uncomfortable, I really like them, together or apart. The tension in the sticks is perfect with some very slight &ldquo;grooves&rdquo; for horizontal and vertical movement (personal preference, but I like it this way).+ Multiplayer from the get-go. No longer do you have to shell out extra on a second controller to get multiplayer on day one of your console ownership.+ The operating system is barebones and FAST! with a small footprint. I prefer this to something that tries to be a poor man&rsquo;s computer with unnecessary features and animations that bog it down and increase loading times (looking at you XBone and PS4). And it looks slick, too.+ Startup times are maybe one or two seconds max. No other console respects your time like the Switch. Pick it up and resume where you left off in Zelda instantly. Put it in sleep mode and it&rsquo;s instantly off so you can go get your life things out of the way before getting back to Zelda. Then instantly turn it back on and game away!+ The fan is very quiet and does a great job at keeping the console cool. It does get noticeably warm during long sessions, but it&rsquo;s a pleasant warmth to the touch and not alarming at all.+ The size of the console is right on point. It is probably the most comfortable handheld from Nintendo (they&rsquo;re not very good at comfortable handhelds though), but it&rsquo;s not so big you can&rsquo;t easily fit it into whatever bag you have. That being said, and as I said before about the batteries, the Switch isn&rsquo;t really a replacement for the 3DS and unless you&rsquo;re a big dude like Boogie2988, you&rsquo;ll never find a pocket this will fit in. Being so large, the screen guarantees a cinematic experience on the go; something which even the 3DS XL doesn&rsquo;t quite deliver.+ It feels very sturdy and tough. This is Nintendo. They make tough devices. (There are some issues though. Look in the negatives, below.)I feel like I could keep fishing for compliments for this System, but I think I&rsquo;ve exhausted anything of significance&hellip; Let&rsquo;s move on to the gripes:– The cover for the screen is hard plastic, much like the one for the upper screen of the 3DS. Except this one is about 5x as glossy as the 3DS and intended to be touched. This causes two problems: 1) if playing in a bright room or outside, the reflections on the screen make it nearly impossible to see details in the game you&rsquo;re playing. I hate seeing my face overlaid on top of my game. 2) it scratches easily. For a handheld touch device of this size and price, a glass screen is almost a necessity. However, glass also breaks, so if the console is for a child, that would mean it has a great chance of cracking from a drop. Conversely, children are not delicate with touch screens and will inevitably cover their screen with scratches. However, Nintendo is not really marketing this console to children like it has others in the past — millennials seem to be their target demographic, judging from their ad campaign — and that makes me think a glass screen would have been the right decision, even if it elevated production costs.– $70 for a pro controller. $80 for a second pair of joy-cons that don&rsquo;t come with a grip. $30 for a charging grip (you can&rsquo;t buy a non-charging one independent of the console). Depending on how you look at it, this makes the official controllers for the Switch the most expensive in the business. But controllers have always been too expensive, in my opinion. ($70 might be okay for a pro controller because it&rsquo;s so good.)– There is only one charging port and it is on the bottom. The Switch needs a bottom charging port, of course, so that the docking gimmick works perfectly, but it really needs a second one on the top to charge it during table-top play, since the battery is not fantastic. The Wii U controller has a charging port on the top and bottom for similar reasons. A second port would be cheap because it wouldn&rsquo;t need the full USB functionality, just the ability to carry a current. Why didn&rsquo;t Nintendo do the same with the Switch? Because they want you to spend $20 on the official stand that raises it up so you can charge it from the bottom. Ridiculous.– The battery should be 50–100% bigger. It is something like 4350 mAmp. I would have paid another $50 for a battery twice as large. But maybe it&rsquo;s not only a cost, bust a space issue. If you want to play Zelda for more than 2-3 hours handheld, you will need a battery bank. I picked up a 10000 mAmp battery with a USB-C outlet and it will completely charge the console one time while playing Zelda and 1.75 times or more while the console is in sleep mode.– UPDATE: This is where I griped about paid online services. Now that we know nintendo&rsquo;s pricing and more about what comes with it, I believe it to be more than fair. $20/year is practically nothing for what you get. My opinion has changed. I admittedly jumped on a bandwagon too soon.– It is very true: The left joy-con can lose connection from even just crossing your legs the wrong way. I told Nintendo on the phone about it and they offered to &ldquo;repair&rdquo; it for free. But that means like 3 weeks or more without Zelda&hellip; also shipping costs. I just can&rsquo;t send it away right now. (By repair, they probably mean put in the quality receiver it should have had in the first place. Apparently just soldering a copper wire to the receiver is enough to make it work wonderfully&hellip; might be something I attempt myself in the future.*UPDATE*I sent my left joy-con off for repairs. After 4 business days it returned with absolutely zero connection problems. If your joy-con is having issues I highly recommend Nintendo&rsquo;s repair service.– The dock needs to be heavier. It moves around too much. It feels cheap compared to the console, but fortunately, it&rsquo;s not something you have to touch frequently.– The dock WILL scratch the screen if you&rsquo;re not careful. Fortunately it won&rsquo;t scratch it any on the viewing surface, just the black borders.– the resistance for docking and removing the Switch should be a little firmer, too. It can be difficult to remove the joy-cons without lifting the console back up. In order to address this problem and the one listed above, I added a piece of the soft side of Velcro to each track on the dock. This helps protect the screen as well as adds just enough resistance to make the act of docking and undocking the Switch much more pleasant and stable.I have no problems with the kickstand. Though I can&rsquo;t get mine to pop out like it&rsquo;s supposed to. It looks like it&rsquo;s bolted in place on mine. Maybe I&rsquo;m just being too timid, but I don&rsquo;t want to break it. It will tip over if you touch it on the left side while it&rsquo;s in table-too mode. But the reality is that you&rsquo;re not supposed to be touching it when it&rsquo;s on a table, anyway.I love my switch, but I&rsquo;m worried Nintendo is headed down the same path as Apple has with their products in that they are started to intentionally gimp their products in favor of selling accessories and adapters. Also, I can&rsquo;t stand behind fees to play games online when I already have to pay for an internet connection.I absolutely would not hesitate to recommend this console. I just wish it didn&rsquo;t feel like Nintendo was starting to become the kind of company that uses cheap tricks to get customers to spend more than should be necessary.</p>

<p>Great system that is perfect to bring to a party, play on the go, or play in your big screen. The colors of the neon joy-cons are extremely bright and beautiful and if you can get your hands on this system for retail price I would 100% recommend it especially with a steady lineup of games that Nintendo and other third party developers have announced.</p>

<h5 id="a-slick-gaming-system-from-nintendo">A slick gaming system from Nintendo</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my son, who plays on it pretty much every day. Pros: This thing was easy to set up and the ability to pull the unit out of the cradle and become portable is flippin&rsquo; cool and works smooth as silk. The blue and red controllers are easy to find and the different colors make it easy to tell which is the left one and which is the right one. Cons: It doesn&rsquo;t come with a game. If you want to buy more controllers, they ain&rsquo;t cheap. As this is a new system, the available game library is a little small at the moment.</p>
