<h5 id="using-the-sx-500-for-workouts-on-my-jaybird-bluebuds-x-sport-earbuds">Using the SX-500 for workouts on my Jaybird Bluebuds X Sport earbuds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was debating either a 4 or 5 star on this review simply due to the price. I ended up giving a 5 though after trying a couple cheap knock-offs that were terrible.I use these on my Jaybird Bluebuds X Sport. The first time I went to put these on, I was not sure they were going to fit (as some other reviewers have mentioned), but they did indeed stretch enough to fit and they stay on very nicely. I use the headphones strictly for my workouts, which is ~ 90% lifting weights with a little cardio added in.A few things I was looking for when purchasing these:1) Better isolation than the stock Jaybird tips, but less isolation than the Comply Isolation tips. These are the perfect in-between! With my music on (fairly loud), it eliminates almost all noise around me. But if I turn my music down or off, I can easily have a conversation and hear what is going on around me.2) Being able to stay in my ears - I sweat quite a bit in the summer while working out and I&rsquo;m always annoyed when my earbuds start slipping out of my ears. While I can&rsquo;t say these are 100% foolproof in this area, they are definitely some of the best ones I&rsquo;ve used.3) Comfort - it wouldn&rsquo;t matter how well they performed if they hurt. I have absolutely no complaints about comfort with these.4) Price - this is where I was debating knocking off a star. They&rsquo;re expensive! But after trying some cheaper options and wasting more money, I have come to the conclusion that they are worth the money.5) Sound - I do feel these help the sound with the isolation and being able to keep the earbuds in my ears where I want them.Overall I highly recommend these to anyone that is active and keep in mind that the 500 series does fit on the Jaybird Bluebuds&hellip;just be careful putting them on and they&rsquo;ll stretch right over.</p>

<h5 id="jaybird-bluebuds-x-a-tight-fit-but-do-go-on">Jaybird bluebuds X - a tight fit but do go on.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These buds at first seemed to be way too small. I contacted support to make sure they are the right fitment for the Jaybird bluebuds x. With a little bit of force they do go on. I used them today on a long run, and I can say that they are great and worth the investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-pair-of-tips-for-iems-for-office-use">Great pair of tips for IEMs for office use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own a pair of IEMs from Ultimate Ears that came with two pairs of Comply earphone tips which lasted about four years. I&rsquo;m not sure which version of Comply they were but judging by their shape it was the Comfort line which needed some getting used to but after that they were great.This time, I decided to buy the Sport Plus version as I felt I needed a more secure fit and thought I might be able to use them when jogging due to their SweatGuard. However, after testing them out I realized they are meant for gym workouts or running on a treadmill because they isolate so, so well. I&rsquo;ve but them on in the office with people around me that are using a mechanical keyboard, talking or coughing and I can&rsquo;t hear them at all. The music sounds great and the fit is good. I&rsquo;d rank them as even more comfortable than the previous foam tips I had from Comply.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-more-like-regular-comply-tips-but-with-a-sweat-guard-on">These are more like regular Comply tips but with a sweat guard on &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not a game changer by any means. The original sport tips had a texture that stayed in your ears and didn&rsquo;t stay wet if you got them sweaty. These are more like regular Comply tips but with a sweat guard on the end. The sweat guard is not effective at keeping wax out of the IEM, as I&rsquo;m now due to replace the filters on my Etymotics. Despite that, I think they&rsquo;re a good product, just not different enough to warrant buying them versus regular.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="game-changing-earbud-tips">Game Changing Earbud Tips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these for my powerbeats which I use when I workout at the gym. The silicone tips that come with the powerbeats and most other earbuds do not seal properly thus letting much of the lower frequencies escape. Also, the silicone tips often fall out of your ears as your activity increases and you sweat making it merely impossible to enjoy your music properly. The Comply Foam Tips change everything. The specialized foam conforms precisely to your ears and make a secure fit that will not easily fall out with sweat or movement. You get the full range of frequencies broadcast by the speakers giving you a much fuller sound. Similar to foam ear plugs used for hearing protection, they block out outside noise allowing you to exclusively listen to your music. These foam earphone tips make even cheap earbuds sound excellent. The only drawback is that they deteriorate over time and will need to be replaced. You will need be sure they have a strong bond and and remain intact after several uses. Although they do last a pretty long time, the last thing you want is a piece of foam lodged in your ear canal. So just be careful. Overall, these are game changers. I wont listen to any earbuds without them.</p>

<h5 id="will-never-go-back-to-regular-tips">Will Never go Back to Regular Tips!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Such a pleasent surprise, I have the Powerbeats 3, which are great headphones but I&rsquo;m a tall guy so my ear holes are too big for the large tips that come with the beats so I was constantly adjusting them while working out. I read about these guys and ordered just hoping for some improvement but they completely changed it. I&rsquo;ve worked out hard in them and sweat all over them and they didn&rsquo;t budge and improved the sound immensely, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="expensive-disposables">Expensive Disposables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I run about 15-20 miles per week and always have my Bluebuds on. I also sweat profusely, so I need earphone tips that make the music sound good and last longer than a few weeks.These tips do not fit these requirements. When I do my normal cross-training, these tips are perfect and last a lot longer than the non-sport complys. But, the tips seem to fall apart and fall out of my ear after 2-3 weeks of constant use while on my runs (3x week ~60min runs).Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t found anything quite as good as the complys as far as sound quality, comfort, and durability are concerned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fit">Great fit!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These earbuds really fit well! They stay in and feel good. I am really happy with my purchase! I bought these to use with my Jabra Halo Smart Wireless Bluetooth headset. You can go to Comply&rsquo;s website to see which earbud works with your headset. [&hellip;]</p>
