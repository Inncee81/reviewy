<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="don-t-get-me-wrong-i-love-the-kids-sonicare-but">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the kids sonicare but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So first, this brushing system was recommended by my son&rsquo;s dentist. It&rsquo;s a good product. I have no complaints about the system, it helps him brush AND gives him the timer so he knows how long to brush for. Excellent design, he uses it, I like it. And other reviewers are correct, these are not easy items to find at the local store.But come on&hellip;am I the only one that thinks almost $20 for two replacement heads is nuts? I can buy a complete battery powered Oral B unit for almost the same price as 1 replacement head! I can buy 2 of the most advanced manual toothbrush in the pharmacy and have money left over for tons of candy (kidding). My point is, how can 2 replacement heads cost so much?Make the price more reasonable, please!</p>

<h5 id="sonic-care-brush-heads-for-kids-brush">sonic care brush heads for kids brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Philips Sonicare HX6032/60 Kids Brush Heads, Ages 4-7 is designed to go with the Philips Sonicare HX6311/02 Sonicare for Kids.The brush heads come in a two pack, one blue brush head and one red brush head as pictured so that if they are being used for multiple children they can distinguish their brush head from their sibling&rsquo;s brush head.The brush heads work with the kids handle (I tried fitting them on my adult Sonicare handle while the kids handle broke and they do not fit on another device except for the kids Sonicare handle) and seem to get the job done.For the most part these brushes hold up well and get the job done, on two occasions when I pulled the brush off the handle I noticed that the brush separated from the base of the brush and broke apart (the brush heads are two pieces snapped together). Luckily we were ready to replace the bush heads but if they would have been brand new I would have absolutely called Sonicare to report this. We have used 6 of these brushes so far and only two of them had issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-these-are-generic-brush-heads-not-from-sonicare">Beware, these are generic brush heads. NOT from Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this because it was slightly lower in cost than the other sonicare brush heads on amazon&hellip;but I thought I was buying the brand name &ldquo;Sonicare&rdquo; brush heads, when in fact what I got were generic brush heads. They fit the Sonicare kids brush bases, but I feel a bit duped that they were advertised as Sonicare brush heads when they are in truth just generic mimics of the sonicare brush head. My original brush heads have the wording &ldquo;Sonicare&rdquo; on the brush head, whereas this one does not. With that in mind, I actually paid for way over priced generic items (which is still lower than the best Sonicare brush head price). If I had known they weren&rsquo;t the Sonicare brush heads, I wouldn&rsquo;t have purchased them at such a high price. I read elsewhere that the generic brush heads last only half as long. I recently purchased these so they are working ok for now, but it makes me upset that I paid a high price for something that won&rsquo;t last. Sneaky description of the item. I wish Amazon would clarify or make sure the vendors do not advertise items as such.</p>

<h5 id="adult-sonicare-diamond-for-kids-don-t-work">Adult Sonicare Diamond For Kids Don&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read few reviews in Amazon that the adult Sonicare brush heads are the same size , and lot lot cheaper over this one. I always buy the adult brushheads from Costco which are very cheap over anywhere else.Philips Sonicare HX6066/70 DiamondClean Standard Brush Heads, 6-Pack. With that in mind, I asked my daughter to try one of them. She hated it and said it was too hard. So went back to these expensive brush heads.Yes it is expensive,but think about even if one dental expense gets cut by this brush, it pays more than itself and also avoids a scary dentist visit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-for-kids">Must have for kids!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My kids get board quickly with brushing their teeth, so I love that their sonicare brushes keep them brushing for the 2 full minutes with the auto-timer. They say to replace them more frequently, but I mainly remember to replace them each time we go for their 6 month cleanings, which have been great check ups since they are using these brushes!My kids came down with strep throat shortly after I replaced them, and I really didn&rsquo;t want to throw the new brushes away. I held the brush part in boiling water for 5 minutes to sanitize them and the brushes held up with no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buyer-beware">Buyer beware.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awful. The bristles kept falling out and it didn&rsquo;t stay put on the main unit. The packaging says &ldquo;Philips&rdquo; but I suspect it&rsquo;s a knockoff. It took a crazy long time to get delivered, and when it did it looked like it was from South Korea. It wasn&rsquo;t inexpensive either, so I feel ripped off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-having-2-different-colors-so-my-2-kids-can">I like having 2 different colors so my 2 kids can &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Both brush heads are blue, not 1 blue and 1 red as shown in the picture. The last line of the product description even reads &ldquo;Two brush heads - one red, one blue - per pack&rdquo;. I like having 2 different colors so my 2 kids can easily distinguish them. I would not have bought these if I knew they were both blue. Using a wrong picture is one of my major pet peeves about many Amazon sellers&hellip;..it happens way too often.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought our first set of Sonicare in 2003 which lasted 7(seven) years. Last year we bought two more new ones for my two daughters and they love it. This year we replaced our two with the new ones since the battery on the old ones were no good after seven years of charging. This year I also bought one for my four year old who loves it and regularly brushes his teeth after dinner. Feels all grown up that he has his own Sonicair just like mom dad and elder sisters.Never had any problems other then the ones I bought for my daughters last year which they replaced after six months without any problem.</p>
