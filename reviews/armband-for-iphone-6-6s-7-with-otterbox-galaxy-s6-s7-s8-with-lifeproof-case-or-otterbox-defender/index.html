<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-fit-for-iphone-with-lifeproof-case">Great Fit for iPhone with Lifeproof Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 4th Tune Belt case for iPhone&hellip;only because of upgrades and/or my dog destroying them. This one came today and while the description doesn&rsquo;t list it as an option for those with an iPhone 6 with a Lifeproof Fre Case, it works perfectly. It is not a super tight fit but that&rsquo;s ok because once it&rsquo;s on your arm, it never shakes or anything. I actually prefer it not super tight as it&rsquo;s easier to pull the phone out of the armband while wearing. So if you have an iPhone 6 with Lifeproof Case&hellip;this is the one to get. I will also say that the durability and lifespan is very good with Tune Belt. If you take care of it, it&rsquo;ll last a very long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-samsung-galaxy-s5">Perfect for my Samsung Galaxy S5</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not be happier with this armband. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 in n OtterBox case and it fits into this armband perfectly. I have no problems using the touch screen while the phone is in the armband, making it easy to adjust the volume of music or start the app to keep track of my run.This armband is easy to put on and take off. I usually put the phone in it before putting it on. It fits comfortably over a long sleeved t-shirt or running shirt but also feels fine on bare skin. I like being able to tuck the cord of my ear buds into the little velcro flap on the side. It stays firmly in place while I&rsquo;m running and I almost never have to adjust it.There is no place on this arm band to store a key, which is something to keep in mind if you need that option. Most of my running shorts/leggings have a small pocket for a key, so not having a key pocket on the armband isn&rsquo;t a big deal for me. Overall, I am really happy with this armband would highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-highly-recommended">Great Product, Highly recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Phone fits great and fits a wide variety of arm sizes.I wanted to find an armband that would easily fit my iPhone 6 in it with the LifeProof and OtterBox cases on them. This product was perfect. It is all very good quality and very well made.My other concern when looking for an armband was I wanted it to fit my arm (I am an average size female) as well as my husbands (he is 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; 300lbs and muscular ). It fits him with about half an inch to spare. Just in case I did buy the extender that the Tune Belt Company makes but we really have not had to use it.I would defiantly buy this product again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-good-armband-for-the-price">This is a very good armband for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used this a couple of weeks now so I think that should be enough to give it a proper review. This is a very good armband for the price. It is light and it breathes well. For summer running in a humid climate, it is a lot cooler than the ArmPocket I had for my 4S so many years ago.However, the ArmPocket is built like a tank and will last for quite some time. I&rsquo;m not as confident with this. For what I paid, I am completely satisfied. It fits a iPhone 6 in a Defender case very weak, but I stress you will need a case the size of the Defender. Do not buy this if you just put your 6 in a smaller case. Tune Belt is very clear on this.Just so you know, I&rsquo;m not a little guy. I an 6&rsquo;1&rdquo; and weigh 230 pounds. This arm band fits my arm fine. I have about a 15&rdquo; arm. If your arm is any bigger, you may need the extension.This product to me delivers what I expected.</p>

<h5 id="nice-snug-fit-for-my-galaxy-s5">Nice Snug Fit for my Galaxy S5</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to use with my Segway One I needed it cause when I&rsquo;d get too far away from my cell phone it&rsquo;d loose the WIFI connection between my cell phone and the Segway One. I like the fact I can wear my cell phone above my elbow pad instead of on my belt clip, I feel that there&rsquo;s a lot less chance of me falling on my phone wearing this way. This arm band was able to fit my Galaxy S5 with my OtterBox case. I like this arm band cause it allows you to touch the screen and make changes through the clear plastic display screen. The fit is snug where you don&rsquo;t have it moving and bouncing around when you&rsquo;re running or in my case riding my Segway One. Thanks for reading my review.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nearly-perfect">Nearly perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After years of running with my phone in-and-out because I couldn&rsquo;t find a cover in stores to accommodate my Otterbox Defender case, I now am the proud owner of this little gem. My Samsung Galaxy S6, in an Otterbox Defender series case, fits in this armband like it was made for it. My phone is easy to use and view through the plastic window, and does not bounce as I run. I can use it with or without earbuds. The back panel seems to be fairly sweatproof. My phone is never moist coming out of the armband, even after long runs. My one disappointment is the low quality hook and loop closure, which began to lose integrity upon the first use. I imagine the ability to stick the band to itself will diminish over time. Overall, an excellent buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-glad-i-had-the-phone-in-a-case-and-was">I&rsquo;m glad I had the phone in a case and was &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I sweat a lot. When I wear this to mow the lawn and do yardwork, by the time I&rsquo;m done, my phone is wet on the backside. It also traps the moisture from the water that penetrates, so the case can get steamy. I&rsquo;m glad I had the phone in a case and was able to wipe it off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="galaxy-s7-active-fits-easily-and-the-clear-face-works-better-to-touch-than">Galaxy s7 active fits easily and the clear face works better to touch than &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For tiny arms, this one is tricky. The velcro tab to hold it on wraps all around my arm, and actually has to attach to a part of the armband that is not intended for velcro&hellip;but it works and lasted a 5k without slipping. Galaxy s7 active fits easily and the clear face works better to touch than my previous armband. Nice!</p>

<h5 id="all-the-time-in-it-and-it-doesn-t-smell-bad-unlike-my-last-arm-band">&hellip; all the time in it and it doesn&rsquo;t smell bad unlike my last arm band</h5>

<p>i sweat all the time in it and it doesn&rsquo;t smell bad unlike my last arm band. The plastic started to break 6 months in but its fine ill probably use it until it is completely dead&hellip;</p>
