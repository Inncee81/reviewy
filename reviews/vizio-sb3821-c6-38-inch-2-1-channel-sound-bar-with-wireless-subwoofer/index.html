<blockquote>
<p>I have had a mixed bag of experiences with this item so far. The first one I had was DOA. I contacted Vizio and went through all their diagnostic solutions with no success. About 2 hours from the point of starting hookup I finally decided it was a lost cause and contacted amazon for a replacement. The replacement came pretty quickly and amazon picked up the return item from the house. The second sound bar installation went off without a hitch. connections were simple and quick. within 20 minutes I was able to connect via blue tooth as well as listening to movies through the television. One nice benefit of the sound bar was that through the tv I am able to control the volume of the sound bar. I do not have a vizio tv. I imagine most of the tvs now will have this capability. The Soundbar turns on and off with the tv power so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about turning on multiple devices. I am using the optical input that comes with the sound bar.After about 2 weeks installed I did run into an issue. My wife stated that the sound bar randomly turned off one day and would not play sound through the tv. I unplugged it and plugged it back in ( both power and optical input ) with no success. I was still able to get it to connect to my phone. Solution was to do a factory reset. Instructions are simple and included in the manual. after the reset and it going through a brief restart process. It reconnected to the tv and I have not had a recurring problem in the week since.If it were purely based on the sound quality, ease of use and setup I would have gladly given it 5 stars. However it had to be knocked down a couple pegs for the temporary aggravation it caused in the interim.Sound quality is good. not high end good. but good. It has enough base with the wireless sub to make an action movie more immersive. The clarity is such that you can have it at a lower volume and still hear dialog quite clearly.when it comes down to it the price is a real driver for this sound bar. It will potentially have some issues and will not offer the same sound quality as a 5-600$ sound bar, but if you were wanting to spend that kind of money you wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this review to begin with. I would still recommend this bar to anyone with the warning that you may spend a few extra minutes fiddling with it to keep it doing its job.for reference the tv is a 55&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="excellent-sound-quality-with-no-distortion">Excellent sound quality with no distortion!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a great sound bar to go with the new 50 inch LED tv I&rsquo;d purchased. Prices for stereo surround systems can run from a few hundred up into the thousands and I personally wasn&rsquo;t looking to spend that much. I wanted something that was better than my tv&rsquo;s speakers without the price of a premium system. I read a LOT of reviews before deciding on this new VIZIO sound bar. Amazon was offering an extra $30 off the normal price for Prime members and I couldn&rsquo;t beat $148 for this system anywhere. This sound gets great reviews from a lot of techies and I can honestly say that it&rsquo;s a great system. It&rsquo;s not just a great sound bar for the money. Instead, this sound bar beats other costing WAY more than this. It has a solid construction, a wireless bluetooth subwoofer and a remote control. To test this sound bar, I played lots of movies (like Godzilla, Transformers and anything else with lots of high pulsing sound) and there was no distortion whatsoever. The sound is crisp and clear and it&rsquo;s so much easier to make out what actors are saying when they tend to mumble. Recently I had a guy over who works as an eletronics installer setting up home theaters for people. He was so impressed with this sound bar that he said he&rsquo;d make it a point to pick one up. He mentioned that he&rsquo;s installed sound bars for other people from all the big brand names and most of those systems didn&rsquo;t sound as good as my VIZIO. If you want a great sound bar and not pay and arm and a leg for it, get this system. It&rsquo;s easy to set up and you&rsquo;ll love it!</p>

<h5 id="but-i-was-really-happy-with-the-quality-of-it-while-it-was-working">but I was really happy with the quality of it while it was working &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my second purchase of the sound bar, as the first one i bought (same model) stopped working after a week This usually would be a red flag to not reorder, but I was really happy with the quality of it while it was working so I figured, hey things happens let me give it another shot.I have this plugged into my Vizio TV and use it for playing video games and watching movies. It has a sub-woofer which is placed by our sofa and provides a very nice bass level. The sound level&rsquo;s the sound bar produces and the clarity is just right for our apartment. We can raise the volume pretty high without experiencing any quality loss. We also frequently use the bluetooth feature to play music from our phones to the sound bar without any problems.Very happy with this purchase! In the future we may go for a 5.1 instead.</p>

<p>I bought this just to play streaming music from my phone in my living room. I wanted to replace my small portable BT speaker I got last year. I&rsquo;m overwhelmed by the sound and value of this unit.It has phenomenal bass for a unit of its size. I&rsquo;m blown away by how it fills my entire room with warm sound. Low profile and I like the minimalist light indicators. Connects to my phone&rsquo;s Bluetooth immediately. I&rsquo;d recommend this to anyone, especially from Amazon warehouse deals. I got an open box unit for a significant savings. The entire unit was unmarred and in absolutely new condition.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-sound-for-the-price">Excellent sound for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to add that I am very pleased with this purchase. I use it only for music, and have so far only used the bluetooth function with a phone and a tablet. It is so nice having zero wires (except for power cords) and such a compact system for my living room. I have the soundbar placed on a mantle that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of depth to it - which is why I went with this over individual speakers.Even over bluetooth, which is necessarily not going to sound as good as a good analog speaker system, the sound quality is amazing. I listen to lots of different genres of music, including classical, rock, and rap and electronic music. I have not yet plugged an audio cable into the speaker because even through bluetooth the sound is much better than my old setup. I&rsquo;m sure it must sound even more amazing with high quality Dolby digital tv stuff.</p>
