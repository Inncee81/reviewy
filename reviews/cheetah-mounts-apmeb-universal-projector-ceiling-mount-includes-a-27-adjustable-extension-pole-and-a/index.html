<ul>
<li>Universal Design with Four Adjustable Arms: The arms are fully adjustable to fit virtually any projector. The arms are also removable for projectors that have less than 4 mounting points.</li>
<li>Vaulted Ceiling Plate: The APMEB is designed so it may be used with vaulted ceilings</li>
<li>7&rdquo; Low Profile and Optional Adjustable Extension Pole: The APMEB is ideal for low profile mounting as well as setups that require an extension pole. The profile is 7&rdquo; without the extension. With the extension, the profile has an adjustable range of 18.75-27&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Safety Cable: Attach the projector to the mount with the metal tether for added security during installation. The cable may also be used as an extra element of security once the projector is mounted.</li>
<li>Cable Management: The center of the ceiling plate is stamped out to allow cables to pass through for a clean and sleek cable management system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The APMEB Universal Projector Mount is one of a kind. We designed this mount to be 100% universal and compatible with all Projectors on the market. The Four Connection Components can be extended or retracted to attach to the mounting holes on the projector. Additionally, some Projectors have only three mounting holes but with this mount, using all four connection components is not necessary. The mounting plate also features a 0-90 degree turn for recessed installation. Our APMEB supports up to 65LBS and constructed of 100% High-Grade Steel.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-purchase">Great purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount did everything i needed it to. It had two different sized arm pieces. The arms are fully adjustable in both length and angle. The mount came with 4 bolts with concrete anchors and 3 different screw sizes to fit multiple projector sizes ( i was able to test with an Optoma HD65 and my recently purchased Optoma W311). For the W311, it took about 5 minutes to get the mount attached to my projector, which includes switching out the arms for the shorter ones and positioning the main connection point to where i wanted it for my setup. Photos show package contents, projector with mount alone and final setup.If you are looking for a fully adjustable projector mount, i would highly recommend this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid">Solid!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit was fantastic! Used it to mount an Epson HomeCinema 500 (also purchased off Amazon) to the ceiling in a bedroom. It worked perfectly! My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to include toggle bolts. The plastic wall anchors that are included with this kit are ok, but when hanging anything from drywall toggle bolts are a much better option. I got four of them from Home Depot for $2.00 and would recommend that over using plastic screw anchors any day. Hope this helps!EDIT:Wow &hellip;I can&rsquo;t believe the amazing customer service from this seller. They read the above review, called me the very next day (left voicemail) and thanked me for the review and suggestion. They then refunded me $6.00 to cover the toggle bolts (I didn&rsquo;t even ask them to!) This is a fine mount from an outstanding Amazon seller! They really do want you to be 100% satisfied with there product. Thank you!!</p>

<h5 id="always-needing-adjusted-edit-fixed-read-review">Always needing adjusted EDIT: FIXED READ REVIEW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a couple months of use this thing is getting just annoying. The way the ball is mounted you just can&rsquo;t keep it level at all. The wing screws that are supposed to hold it tight just don&rsquo;t. One has stripped out on me. At this point I have let it &ldquo;float&rdquo; and adjusted my electric shift on my vplaw50 it&rsquo;s just getting annoying having to adjust it 2-3 times a week. You can see how it &ldquo;leans&rdquo; in the pics I&rsquo;ve posted. If the ball pivot point was designed different it would be a solid 5 star but I just can&rsquo;t give more then 2 because that&rsquo;s basically the heart of this design.EDIT: cheetah mounts contacted me and offered a free replacement stating they have a new design, i accepted and they set me a new one, visually it appears the same, however i installed it and it does in fact hold much much better, if tight enough it does not lag like the previous, a very well improved product! 5 stars would have been given had they not called 3-4 times over 2 weeks begging me to re review the product, i simply do not re review products immediately, i want to test them out thoroughly, well here is the review, well done, but dont be so aggressive with asking to be reviewed with others</p>

<h5 id="floating-projector">Floating projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this mount to hold up my projector and premier moves in collaboration with the 119&rdquo; manual projector screen from Amazon. Fantastic setup all together. Actually mounted it to a drop ceiling panel by laying a thicker piece of plywood behind the panel extending over the tracks to dissipate the load weight. Worked perfectly and was a breeze to put together. Actually took me longer to figure out how to flip the image on the projector as my style is used mounted upside down on the mount. Supplied hdmi cord worked great for the beginning setup. Actually ended up using a 100&rsquo; hdmi cable to run everything to my receiver in another room, works perfect and will use the hdmi this came with for connecting the receiver to the DVD player. Would definitely purchase again as the price is great for a quality item. The cords from the projector feed up through the support to be out of site, quick tip is to run the cables through before mounting to the roof, just makes everything easier.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-work-well-with-acer-6510">Does not work well with Acer 6510</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this product and had a hard time hooking it up to my acer projector. It is off center and it sits on a ball joint. The center of gravity forces the projector to move from the originally set position. Please dont buy this if you have ACER 6510.UPDATE : I got a call from the Cheetah Mount customer support immediately a day after the review was written. They acknowledge that some customers faced an issue when using this mount with off center projectors or very heavy projectors. They informed that they try to read every review posted and get back to the buyers regarding the reviews. I was told that they take into consideration all inputs provided in case of issues and the RnD team uses these inputs to make a better product. I was offered a full refund for the trouble as the prototype for the better version of this product is still in development and they could not provide me a better replacement.I am very happy with the customer support and the effort they took to make sure the customer is satisfied with the product. I will definitely buy another product from them.</p>

<h5 id="the-best">the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i have purchased many mounts, but this one by far is my favorite. has all the swivels and adjustments needed for a wall, ceiling, and floor mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-benefit-is-that-fine-tune-adjustments-are-easy-to-make">The benefit is that fine-tune adjustments are easy to make</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The knuckle joint near the base of the projector makes it nearly impossible to lock the projector in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">Don&rsquo;t buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first review of any product. It is almost impossible to get the projector alignment correct with this mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to">Easy to</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly! Easy to install</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-value">Amazing value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing value for $25 and was easy to set up and works great. It comes with long and short arm connectors for big and small projectors. Used the short armed ones on an Epson.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-solid-and-versitile">Really solid and versitile.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its a tad complicated but to be inget exacttly what i want in the end which is the abilty to point just about anywere inwant b. And adjust in so many ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cannot-make-fine-adjustments-to-projector-renders-it-useless">cannot make fine adjustments to projector - renders it USELESS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mounting part is nice and easy to install, but you cannot make minor adjustments to the projector once you hang it - it just hangs there and moves easily to the slightest&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-hadn-t-expected-sticker-on-it-like-they-expected-it-but-missing-the-major-bolts-and">It hadn&rsquo;t expected sticker on it like they expected it but missing the major bolts and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It hadn&rsquo;t expected sticker on it like they expected it but missing the major bolts and screws to be able to use it so it&rsquo;s worthless so I send it back</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-mount">Great Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a well made mount for the money. The only reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is that the bolts don&rsquo;t tighten down well so some of the pieces move if the projector is bumped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fit-s-my-optoma-perfectly-no-problems-with-ball-joint">Fit&rsquo;s my optoma perfectly. No problems with ball joint &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit&rsquo;s my optoma perfectly. No problems with ball joint at all.The extention bar comes in handy if you have a ceiling fan between the projector and the screen.</p>
