<p>Style Name:Stainless Steel Toaster
Housed in brushed and chrome stainless steel, this high-quality KRUPS KH732D50 toaster not only looks good on the counter, but it also toasts bread to perfection—up to two slices at a time. The unit&rsquo;s extra-large, self-centering slots (1.5 inches wide by 5.75 inches long) can accommodate a variety of items, including bagels, buns, English muffins, and thick slices of homemade bread. Choose bagel mode for warming the outside and toasting the cut side of bagels; defrost mode for toasting items like frozen waffles, toaster pastries, or toaster hash browns; reheat mode for warming without toasting; or the cancel function to end the session at any time. You just have to turn the knob to select one of the six browning settings, from light to dark. Other highlights include blue LED indicators, a high-lift lever for smaller items, two removable crumb trays for easy cleaning, and cord storage to help keep countertops looking tidy. The KRUPS KH732D50 four-slice toaster offers exceptional convenience on its own or as part of the matching KRUPS Breakfast Set ensemble</p>

<h5 id="great-toaster-update-awesome-toaster">Great toaster! Update: Awesome toaster!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did a lot of research on toasters here at Amazon before deciding on this one. Reviews are all over the board for this and every other toaster. The biggest selling point for me was the generous size of the slots. I wanted to be able to put my organic seed bread in without having to bend it or shove it in. I also wanted to be able to fit a bagel in without shaving off some of it first. Everything I&rsquo;ve put in this toaster has fit easily. The bagel setting does a wonderful job of toasting the cut side while warming the outside. The defrost setting is perfect for toaster strudels. It defrosts them, then toasts them so when they come out they are done throughout, and not still hard and cold in the middle. English muffins can finally be toasted in one pass instead of two or more. A complaint people seem to have about this toaster is that it gets too hot&hellip;it&rsquo;s an appliance so yes, it does get rather warm, but I&rsquo;ve never had an urge to fondle my toaster while it is toasting, so there is no reason for the warmth to bother me. It also has a high-lift lever so you never need to touch the toaster to remove your item. The only drawback to this toaster for me is the settings dial, which goes from 1-6. I like lightly browned toast and to achieve that I have to go to 4.5, so the lower settings are useless to me. If you like dark toast, this will not do the job, but if you&rsquo;re fine with light to medium toast, this is a great choice. If this toaster lasts more than a year, I will up the rating to 5 stars. The longevity would make up for the lack of variety of the settings dial.<strong>UPDATE</strong> I&rsquo;ve had this for over a year, and I love it even more. The settings dial I mentioned previously is actually totally dependent on which breads you use. If you use a white or potato bread, you can get a nice toast on a lower setting. It has consistently made wonderful toast, bagels, english muffins, pop tarts and toaster strudels for my family of five. It gets used at least once a day, if not more, and the toast is fairly even on both sides (I&rsquo;ve never had a toaster that was perfectly even in terms of toasting). I use the same setting day after day for my favorite bread, and the results are always consistent. It still looks shiny and new, it&rsquo;s easy to clean with the removable crumb tray and/or shaking it upside down outside. The cord is very long for a toaster, which I love, and it has a built-in cord wrap on the underside to keep excess out of sight. This is, hands down, the best purchasing decision I&rsquo;ve ever made on Amazon.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="super-disappointing">Super disappointing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited to receive this toaster, but it is completely disappointing. I first tried toasting at level 3. It had a nice color, but it didn&rsquo;t toast one side. I thought maybe the bagel function was turned on accidentally, so I tried it again. Same thing. Then I tried it with the bagel function, just in case these features got swapped. The bagel function did not toast either side. I then toasted at a 3.5 and it was lighter than a 3. I made a chart so you can see how the levels toasted for me. Needless to say this is going back. Not sure I want to chance having another not work.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-krups-kh732d-sounded-very-good-nice-features">The Krups KH732D sounded very good. Nice features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our old toaster that we&rsquo;d had for several years was starting to toast very unevenly, so we decided to get a new one. I read reviews and tried to choose one that was still fairly inexpensive, but maybe $10-20 more than the basic 19.99 models. The Krups KH732D sounded very good. Nice features. And after all, it&rsquo;s just a toaster. How hard can it be to evenly toast a slice of bread.More difficult than this thing can manage I guess.It toasts unevenly. The inside side of the bread is more toasted than the outside. I know the toaster does that if on the bagel setting, but I don&rsquo;t have it on the bagel setting. And on top of that, on one side, the upper right quadrant of the slice is always much darker than the rest of the slice.For the love of <insert your deity here>, why can&rsquo;t a simple toaster just toast evenly, on both sides, top to bottom? Do I really have to spend up to $100 or more just to get what the most basic toaster should be able to accomplish?We&rsquo;ll just keep this one until I get thoroughly pissed off and then I&rsquo;ll toss it and buy another.Also, it isn&rsquo;t cool to the touch when toasting. I&rsquo;d forgotten to look for that feature, so my fault there.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="good-toaster-does-what-we-expect">Good toaster, does what we expect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having lived with this toaster for a couple of months now (after spending WAY too much time making a decision), I can say we&rsquo;re very happy with it. Some specifics:- the bagel feature works well &ndash; set it for about 5.5, lower the bagels and push the bagel button. It toasts only the cut side of the bagel (you DID orient the bagel with the cut sides inward, right?).- the reheat feature works well. If you get interrupted, or if the toast is done way before the eggs, this feature lets you reheat the toast without destroying it.- it seems to be very well made, and looks great.So, unless your expectations of a toaster vastly exceed mine, I&rsquo;d say go for it. Or, like me, you can spend another three hours reading random comments like this while looking for the perfect toaster.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-first-toaster-i-felt-obliged-to-return-kinda-says-it-all">The first toaster I felt obliged to return - kinda says it all.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really couldn&rsquo;t decide how to rate this thing. At first, I was going to give it 2 stars, but in the end decided to give it 1 star, because it was the first toaster I felt obliged to return. I&rsquo;ve purchsed 6 toasters in the past 8 years - what the heck is going on?This thing had excellent reviews, even Consumer Reports! Yep, I&rsquo;m old!Now befoer you dismiss this as a review by someone that doesn&rsquo;t know how to operate a toaster, let me tell you that I tried everything&hellip; I was convinced that I was doing something wrong. There was no way this thing could be this bad!I tried three different settings and could not get a consistent piece of toast ot of this thing.One side would toast and the other side was barely warm; no, I did not have it on the bagel setting!To top it all off, the side that was toasted, was uneven - toasted more on top than the bottom and obvious verticle banding&hellip; (see attached photos)I&rsquo;ve given up and am making my toast in the broiler!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="best-toaster-ever">Best toaster ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best toaster ever!! I&rsquo;ve had other brands in the past, but Krups has perfected the toasting of bagels. The beautiful blue lights on the front panel against the shimmering silver polished surfaces caused me to forget to select the proper toasting level. I hate cluttered kitchen counters and aside from the Mr. Coffee, this is the only appliance I allow on the counter.READ MORE</p>

<p>Just out of the box noted very lightweight, not sturdy. When you tap the side it sounds like an aluminum soda can. I did not even use it, returned straight away.</p>

<p>works great - perfect toast, bagels and english muffins</p>
