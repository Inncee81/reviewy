Sonicare is the power toothbrush brand most often recommended by U.S. Dental professionals. This kit includes 1 healthy white handle, 1 standard proresults brush head, 1 hygienic travel cap, 1 travel charger, and 1 travel case.</p>

<h5 id="sonicare-excellence-add-the-diamond-clean-brush-heads">Sonicare excellence- Add the Diamond Clean Brush heads.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Healthywhite handle has virtually the same internals and power as Sonicare&rsquo;s more expensive offerings without adding features most of us may not need-like a &ldquo;charging glass.&ldquo;Sonicare gives us one &ldquo;ProResults&rdquo; Brush head here. I used it for a couple of days and then replaced it with the Diamond Clean brush head. The difference in the quality and efficiency of the Diamond Clean head was immediate- It has a denser pattern of bristles, feels smoother on the teeth and gums and after about 5 days, it looks like I just got back from the dentist.Sonicare correctly tells us that the ProResults head is 2X better than a manual brush and that the Diamond Clean is 7X better- and that the Diamond Clean is it&rsquo;s their BEST brush head. Amazon&rsquo;s current partner for the Diamond Clean heads is excellent- I ordered the 3 pack with standard shipping and received them in two days. Buy a 3 pack of Diamond Clean heads to make your Sonicare Healtywhite the best.Enjoy</p>

<h5 id="second-sonicare-in-two-years">Second Sonicare in two years</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a time when I could purchase a Sonicare Toothbrush and it would last for seven years. I guess those days are over. Just purchased this toothbrush in September, 2013 and the battery died today (less than a year from purchase.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hated-it-then-grew-to-love-it">Hated it, then grew to love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been using a Spinbrush for at least two years but became curious about sonic ones recently. I relied on Amazon comparisons and reviews and decided on this mid-range Healthywhite model &ndash; the DiamondClean seems powerful and is aesthetically gorgeous but I had zero need for that many features and that high a price. I liked that this Healthywhite has three basic modes and a low-profile charger.I purchased it during a great sale with some coupons and gave it a shot. Hated it. Didn&rsquo;t clean the plaque well enough, brush head felt way too small, the buzzing was awkward. I seriously considered returning it. The awesome price and everyone else&rsquo;s positive reviews convinced me to hang on, though, and I was pleasantly surprised.There&rsquo;s a two-week &ldquo;ramp-up&rdquo; period where the brush gradually becomes more powerful as you get used to the sensation. And suddenly one day, the surfaces of my teeth felt smooth as silk, and the gumlines were flawless. I&rsquo;m totally ready for the praise from my dentist. That clean feeling also motivates me to floss more often in order to to maintain it. There&rsquo;s also no gunk build-up on the handle, it has a slim profile, and I like that I can try the more expensive brush heads on this base. I love the quadpacer feature as well &ndash; keeps me brushing for two minutes. I haven&rsquo;t been able to really tell if my teeth are whiter, but I don&rsquo;t smoke or anything &hellip; my teeth are already white. The plaque cleaning is what matters to me.My complaints: You have to cycle through the modes every time &ndash; the brush doesn&rsquo;t keep the last one you used. And the power button is the same as the mode button, so you can&rsquo;t choose a cycle before adding the toothpaste unless you want everything to go flying. Yes, there are only three modes, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have to memorize the order of them or try to stare in the mirror while the brush is in my mouth. Battery isn&rsquo;t replaceable, but I suppose that&rsquo;s the trade-off for the slim profile. I also wish it had come with an extra brush head.(Background on my teeth: I&rsquo;m in my late 20s, have been a deficient flosser since childhood [Dentist: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to have perfect teeth like your big sisters?&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;] and not diligent about brushing twice a day; occasional gum sensitivity because of lack of flossing; braces as a teen, Invisalign as an adult; normal checkups otherwise)</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-huge-improvement-over-the-older-elite-models">So far, so good - HUGE improvement over the older Elite models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I upgraded to this toothbrush after I got tired of my previous Sonicare Elite series, which I used daily for almost 5 years straight. The Elite series did an excellent job brushing my teeth, but by the end of it&rsquo;s life, the battery no longer held a reasonable charge. On a full charge, it would brush for maybe 4 to 6 minutes total (2 to 3 brushings) before losing all power. Because the charging base was so large, this made it all but useless for travel. In addition, with the older Sonicare Elite-style brush heads, anyone who used to own one will tell you that they get GROSS quickly. The design seemed like it wasn&rsquo;t well thought out - the brush would take in water into the cavity formed where the brush head screwed into it, and in a matter of days, you would literally have mold and filth growing in and around the gap between the two. It was very difficult to clean that gap out, and in the end, I decided I wasn&rsquo;t going to buy another Sonicare.So I began my first search for a new tooth brush in years, and I figured I&rsquo;d end up with a competitor like Oral-B. However, I immediately noticed that Sonicare must have realized the flaw in their old design, and I noticed the new snap-on style brush head of the Healthywhite model. I sat down and compared reviews, and decided I&rsquo;d give Sonicare another chance.I&rsquo;ve been using the brush for about a month now and I am VERY glad I went with this Healthywhite model. It keeps the great cleaning ability of my older Sonicare, while widely improving upon all of the previous flawed areas. First of all, the new brush heads just push down onto a metal rod and are very easily removable. The instructions recommend pulling the head off once a week and running the base of the head under water to rinse out any &ldquo;gunk&rdquo;. Takes 5 seconds total and works perfectly, no more disgusting mold build-up. Secondly, the new charger it sits on is TINY, it would be perfect for extended travel if you think you&rsquo;ll need a recharge away from home. But you probably won&rsquo;t, as the battery on this thing is amazing. In the past 30 days, I&rsquo;ve brushed roughly 60 times, and only had to charge the brush twice total! You could go on a two week trip with this brush and never need a single recharge. And lastly, the handle design on this Healthywhite is VERY comfortable to hold and maneuver while brushing. I never really had much of a complaint about the old design either, but this has certain been a pleasant improvement.Anyways, Philips has simplified the design to make it easier to clean and maintain, improved the battery life immensely, and improved the charger design. Everything works well and this brush cleans my teeth as well as if not better than any other brush I&rsquo;ve ever used before. I&rsquo;ll update this in the future if I have any problems with it, but I really don&rsquo;t know what else I&rsquo;d ask for in a rechargeable toothbrush. I highly recommend this product.</p>
