<h5 id="brush-heads-are-soft-but-are-big-for-kids-and-mine-were-both-blue">Brush heads are soft but are big for kids and mine were BOTH blue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These kid brush heads are just ok. For years, I would just buy the ProResults Compact for my kids since it is small and soft for them, however it seems that they have been discontinued. So I bought these and I was not too thrilled with it.Even though the item description and photo says there is a red and blue brush head, mine came with two blue brush heads. This was not clear when I purchased this that it will be both blue. There are no differences between the brush heads meaning my kids have no way to tell it apart, so I have to use stickers or mark it somehow. Other Sonicare brush heads I&rsquo;ve had in the past can change the color at the bottom, but these do not have that option. The description should be updated to state when it&rsquo;s the same color.In addition, the brush head is big for my 9 and 7 year old kids. It&rsquo;s about the same size as their manual toothbrush, perhaps a bit bigger. It&rsquo;s the same size as my DiamondClean. When using these brush heads, they tend to spray toothpaste more since it is bigger. They liked the Pro Results compact size better. I don&rsquo;t know why they got rid of this line, this was a popular line.The only good thing is that the brush heads are soft and are good quality. I will look for other options for my next purchase.</p>

<h5 id="makes-a-big-difference">Makes a big difference</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It might seem early for a kid of 8 (now 9) to use an electric toothbrush of the quality and sophistication provided by Sonicare. Not at all. We are very glad we tried it. The difference between regular toothbrushes and the Sonicare is entirely visible. Our son&rsquo;s teeth are a gorgeous white, and proof of what made the difference is that when, without realizing it, the toothbrush had been accidentally reset to the shorter, entry-level cycle, we wondered after a few days why his teeth were not looking so great. I checked the brush and found the error, reset and within a couple of days his teeth were looking fabulous again. Like we adults, after using the Sonicare for a while it feels yucky to him to use a regular toothbrush again.We travel a bit and the toothbrush holds its charge for up to about two and a half weeks. The charger is easy to transport. The subscription service we use with Amazon is great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-well-but-way-way-overpriced">Work well but way, way overpriced!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are so overpriced! Not just on Amazon but everywhere. You are better off getting the adult Sonic care for you kids just to save on the heads. It will pay for itself in a few years as you save on the heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="price-is-a-ripoff">price is a ripoff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These work well but the price is outrageous.Basically they are sticking it to parents who need a smaller brush head for kids.Charging 50% more than the same 50 cents worth of plastic for adults, nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-the-kid-s-sonicare-toothbrush">Fits the kid&rsquo;s Sonicare Toothbrush.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits the ridiculously expensive toothbrush that was purchased for the kid&hellip; Her dentist recommended it to train the kids how long to brush for. The kid&rsquo;s mother decided to buy it&hellip; Then you need to buy these replacement heads that fit kid sizes every couple months. Well I found them here on Amazon. Not sure if we&rsquo;re going to keep going with this system or not. I never had a motorized tooth brush, and I didn&rsquo;t get my first cavity until I was in my 20s. I don&rsquo;t know if we will be buying any further replacements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-choice">Excellent choice.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this for my special needs granddaughter and she loves it!. Excellent choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-kids">Great for Kids</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for several years now and have been very impressed as to how much better it cleans my teeth. I bought a kid&rsquo;s version for my grandson when he was 6 (what an amazing grandfather I am!!!) especially as it had brush heads for different ages. Although not the world&rsquo;s most exciting present, he found it fun to have an electric toothbrush and so uses it more often and more readily than he used his ordinary brush. So in the long run it is a present that will have a good impact. I bought these replacements because now he is old enough for the next level of brush. Yes, they are not cheap compared to normal toothbrushes but the fact that he readily uses it and his teeth are cleaner is worth the price, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-technology-but-replacements-price-should-not-be-so-high">Good technology - but replacements price should not be so high</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the toothbrush for my kids - I feel better knowing that they are getting a good cleaning w/o them having the skills to brush up and down.The hardest part is these brushes are $8 to $9 each for the heads !They are following the Gillette model way and it should not be so high !</p>
