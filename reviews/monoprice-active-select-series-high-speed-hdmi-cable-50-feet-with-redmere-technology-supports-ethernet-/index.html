<p>Size:50 Feet
A High Speed HDMI Cable with Red Mere from Monoprice is the best way to transmit your High Speed HDMI signals over the longest distances while using the thinnest cables possible! Red Mere technology is a breakthrough in the functionality and efficiency of HDMI cables. High Speed HDMI Cables with Red Mere can reliably distribute High Speed signals to much greater distances up to 65 feet (20 meters) at the full 10.2 Gbps data throughput as opposed to the 25 foot distance for HDMI cables without Red Mere technology. This can be done with thinner and lighter cables which are easier to handle and route through your home theater system and which put less stress on your equipment&rsquo;s HDMI ports. Normally a cable of this length would be incapable of supporting the full 10.2 Gbps High Speed HDMI data rate even with 22 AWG conductors. However with the Red Mere chip installed in this cable it fully supports all High Speed HDMI features with only 28 AWG conductors. Note that HDMI Cables with Red Mere are directional. One end must be connected to the source device (e.g. Blu-ray player) and the other end to the sink/display (e.g. HDTV). Hooking them up backwards will not damage anything they just won&rsquo;t transmit a signal. Also note that these cables are fully compatible with switches splitters matrix devices etc. They can be used in any application in which a normal HDMI cable can be used and many applications where HDMI extenders would otherwise be required! The VW-1 rating on this cable indicates that it complies with fire safety codes and insurance requirements and is safe for use inside the walls of residential class buildings. TIP: It is a good idea to test cables and connections before installing them inside a wall.</p>

<h5 id="finally-a-solution-for-my-projector-tv">FINALLY A SOLUTION FOR MY PROJECTOR TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have worked for a few months now trying to find the right combination to connect my Samsung home theater to my new projector. The unit just would not push enough wattage to the projector through a 50 foot HDMI cord for it to not drop the picture. I talked with the experts at the big Blue and Yellow electronics store about my issue, they were of no help. I called SAMSUNG to discuss if there were something they could help me with, Huge waste of time. I purchased the &ldquo;Monoprice 107700 131-Feet PREMIUM Metallic HDMI Active Equalizer Extender Repeater&rdquo; from Amazon and that was a fail, so I came back to try something else. THIS IS THE FIX. Finally the components all work together and the picture never drops no matter what.</p>

<h5 id="works-wonders">Works Wonders!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cable works wonders! I never thought I would be so enthused over an HDMI cable. However, this cable works where others have failed.I had purchased over a year ago this HDMI Matrix 4x2 Switcher Box from Monoprice. It allows 4 HDMI devices to connect to not just one, but two devices independently. Great concept, except it never worked right. I had the same problem I had with other switch boxes - always-on devices like Chromecast, Roku, etc were not always detected by the switch. A year later, I finally decided to try again with this HDMI cable with Redmere technology. Worked like a charm!Looking around Amazon, there are not many cables with Redmere this inexpensive either, which is a nice plus. Still a premium over plan HDMI cables, but the thin wire is a benefit, since it can compete in quality with the thick premium cables that are so thick they do not bend very well.When I run my cables again in my new space, I will be looking at buying the longer run of these cables. I will try to update this post once I can test the quality over a longer distance (only 10ft currently)</p>

<h5 id="it-works-and-its-thin">It works and its thin.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these to run in the wall up into the attic and down another wall to the TV on the other side of the room. 50&rsquo; is a long run for an HDMI cable, but I&rsquo;ve had no problems at all with a 1080p signal running through it. These cables are thin. I&rsquo;ve seen 5&rsquo; HDMI cables thicker than these, so they are easy to work with. Just make sure you get the direction correct before running them. Because these have a chip in them to boost the signal it matters which end goes to the source and witch end goes to the TV. They are marked right on the connectors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-best">This is the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the best cables money can buy. As a construction guy I run cables thru the attic and thru walls, I want something that will last, something that is the best, ( So I don&rsquo;t have to climb in the attic twice)This company is my &ldquo;GO TO&rdquo; for HDMI CablesThey also work great for &ldquo;Long Runs&rdquo; as HDMI signal can be reduced when going over 5-10 feet. Some of my cables are 50 feet long, And no problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wasted-hours-upon-hours-of-my-life">Wasted hours upon hours of my life.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as I plugged this cable in, DirecTV started telling me that my TV wasn&rsquo;t HDCP compliant and that I needed to use component cables. I did some Googling to discover what I already knew, that this problem was a bunch of BS most commonly caused by HDMI cables. I went ahead and fiddled with it for a bit anyway and finally got it to work by messing with the the inputs. I still have no idea why it ended up working, but it worked on and off for a few days until I decided to put my receiver inline to try and solve the consistency issues. That seemed to solve all my problems. Everything worked fine for 2 weeks. I went out of town for Christmas and when I got back, nothing worked. I fiddled with it a little and got it to work again, but after 10 minutes of normal TV watching, everything went out again. I&rsquo;ve not been able to get it to come back using the receiver configuration since. I can get the signal through directly from the DirectTV STB (Genie) but it won&rsquo;t pass the HDCP handshake. I can get the signal directly from my Xbox One, but it maxes out at 640x480 resolution. I am completely frustrated with the whole situation and this cable is the common denominator for all of my issues. Seeing as my receiver is passing no video now, I am hoping that what I&rsquo;ve read about Redmere cables frying hardware isn&rsquo;t true. That would be an expensive mistake.</p>

<h5 id="cable-did-not-work-for-me">cable did not work for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this as an extension for my Oculus rift, along with a coupler. When using this HDMI cable i would get a crackling noise in the oculus headphones a bit. Then after some playing I would lose the signal to the Oculus. I test the coupler with another HDMI cable I had and the coupler worked fine. Very disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t test the cable more before I had put it together with the USB extension I was also using, as I damaged the shielding on this cable taking them apart (I know it wasn&rsquo;t damaged putting them together, I was just upset and careless with the scissors taking them apart.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfectly-used-in-combination-with-a-hd-view-hdmi-splitter">Works perfectly - used in combination with a HD View HDMI Splitter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using this with the ViewHD Advanced HDMI Splitter for 1080P &amp; 3D - The whole purpose of this review is to confirm this RedMere Cable works with a splitter. Thus I can use with the a splitter to send video and audio to multiple outputsFirst I verified the RedMere cable worked perfectly directly from the cable box to a TV, and also from a Samsung Blu-ray player to the TV.Next I hooked it up to the ViewHD splitter, it didn&rsquo;t work, and of course it was operator trouble, I forget to reset the sources (TV &amp; Source) and then connect the cables and then power up the splitter. Once I powered everything down, unplugged the splitter&rsquo;s power adapter, powered up the source and target TVs, and then plugged the power adapter into the splitter everything worked perfectly. Remember, there is a lot of handshaking going on with HDMI, so it&rsquo;s important to keep that in mind and reset everything so the handshaking happens once the splitter is put in place.Look for comments by HDMI in the ratings section of the HDMI Splitter - it&rsquo;s the ViewHD support person providing tons of information.</p>

<h5 id="works-perfect">Works Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a long HDMI cable to run through my walls to my projector. I knew that long HDMI cables are a crapshoot so I ordered this with a lot of hesitation. After fishing is through the walls I was pleasantly surprised that it works perfectly. Been running it for several weeks now without a single issue.</p>
