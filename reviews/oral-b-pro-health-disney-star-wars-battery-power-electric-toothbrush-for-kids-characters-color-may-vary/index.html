<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="encourages-our-toddler-to-brush-more-often">Encourages our toddler to brush more often</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to get our two-year-old to brush his teeth more often and more efficiently, our dentist recommended we get a spinbrush toothbrush. We&rsquo;ve been using one for the last few months and &ldquo;brushing time&rdquo; has gotten a lot better. It&rsquo;s still a battle at times, but he&rsquo;s definitely brushing more.We recently received this one and there are several things we like about it:1) The spinning is fairly powerful, but not overwhelming for our toddler.2) It already comes with batteries.3) It&rsquo;s not too large for his mouth.4) The Stars Wars theme is awesome. He got the Darth Vader one.5) The price is great. A lot cheaper here than in my local stores.6) And most importantly, our son loves it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mario">Mario!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have three boys so Mario Brothers of course was a big hit! I gave this toothbrush for stars because I was hoping to get different characters so that I could distinguish who had who&rsquo;s toothbrush. Aside from that it is doing the trick just fine. I used a sharpie to mark each toothbrush with the letter of the kids his name and so the silver lining is that they are gaining familiarity with their name letter. Haha. The head of the toothbrush is a standard size but not too big to fit in the back of my two-year-old smell. You can push down on the button or lock it in place to stay on if you choose. I have ordered them before and the battery lasts through most of the toothbrush depending on how long they let it run while not brushing. You honestly can&rsquo;t beat the price of this toothbrush for what you get.</p>

<h5 id="great-but-loud-and-large">Great but loud and large</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> These are a great quality little electric toothbrush for a child. We were slightly bummed when we ordered 2 (one for each child) and got the same character (yoda). We solved that issue by writing their initials on the bottom in sharpie marker &amp; it&rsquo;s been fine (thankfully they have different first initials!!).We got these to replace the kid&rsquo;s old Colgate electric toothbrushes and there were a few things I was quite pleased about, however there were also some things we also had some major &ldquo;growing pains&rdquo; to get through as well. We loved that for such an inexpensive brush, the bristles do actually rotate! That also means those little openings in the back of the toothbrush for water to get in. For our family, it&rsquo;s not a huge issue since our children aren&rsquo;t able to brush their own teeth, so that means a parent is rinsing out and drying the brushes after each use (and inspecting for potential areas where water could hide out and feed mold). I did want to mention it, though, so that other parents remember to check your little ones brushes and teach them good brush hygiene. ;) Also, another &ldquo;issue&rdquo; that wasn&rsquo;t a problem for our family was the handle size on the brush. It&rsquo;s significantly larger than any other &ldquo;kids&rdquo; toothbrush that we have used. If you have a small 3 or 4 year old, it may take a bit of getting used to at first. The biggest problem that I see with these toothbrushes is the noise! We&rsquo;ve been using them for about 2.5 months now and our children use them AWESOME now, but at first these brushes scared them! It took about one and a half weeks for our kids to get back into a regular &ldquo;no big deal&rdquo; schedule of brushing their teeth. At first they pushed it away as soon as you turned the brush on! If you have kids with pronounced auditory sensitivities- these would be a hard pass. But if you have kids that might have &ldquo;slight sound aversions&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t automatically put these on your &ldquo;NO&rdquo; list. Our kids only took 1.5 weeks to get them added into their daily schedule (huge win for kiddos with special needs). I&rsquo;m adding a video that I took to compare these brushes to the old Colgate electric toothbrushes that we started them on (turn your volume up!)</p>

<h5 id="what-are-you-waiting-for-buy-it">What are you waiting for? buy it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, what can I say? it&rsquo;s been 3 months and my 3 year old is ALWAYS excited to brush his teeth. I usually don&rsquo;t write reviews but I had to do it this time. Last night, we completely forgot to remind my son to brush his teeth and he had already gotten in bed. Husband and I went to watch a movie downstairs and after 20 minutes, we heard steps upstairs. I quickly went upstairs to see if my son needed anything and he was in the bathroom BRUSHING HIS TEETH!!! I have to say that not only this brush but also the Aquafresh kids toothpaste makes it fun to put the toothpaste into this great toothbrush. BUY IT!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product-for-the-price">Nice product for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered two for my boys. Nixe quality. The only downside has nothing to do with the toothbrush itself but the fact that you can&rsquo;t choose the character. I ordered two assuming I would receive two different ones, unfortunately I got two Darth Vader toothbrushes. I exchanged one at a local chain store since they carry them as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-little-toothbrushers">Perfect for little toothbrushers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have 8, 5 &amp; 3 year old boys who use these battery operated toothbrushes. I think they are especially important for kids because they aren&rsquo;t the best at tooth brushing even with supervision. I feel like the scrubbing motion of these brushes helps keep their teeth &amp; gums healthier than a manual toothbrush. The batteries last well as long as they don&rsquo;t leave them running when not in use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-dentist-pointed-out-that-few-people-actually-learn-good-technique-anyway">My dentist pointed out that &ldquo;few people actually learn good technique anyway&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 4 yr old son loves this. I was hesitant to get it as my wife and I wanted him to learn proper technique with a manual toothbrush first. My dentist pointed out that &ldquo;few people actually learn good technique anyway&rdquo;. Since using it, his front bottom incisors have had less tarter on them. I wish the toothbrush portion was replaceable but knew this when buying it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-the-perfect-size-for-my-4-year-old">It&rsquo;s the perfect size for my 4 year old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what it purports to be. A Star Wars themed toothbrush designed for kids. It&rsquo;s the perfect size for my 4 year old, and she loves the design. The on/off buttons work well, and it&rsquo;s easy enough (with the use of a small screwdriver) to replace batteries should the need arise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves it very much. He spends twice as long to brush his teeth!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works as expected</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yes">Yes!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a hygienist and bought two of these for demonstration purposes at my two dental offices..I recommend spin brushes for all my patients..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-some-powerful-and-great-kid-electric-brushes">these are some powerful and great kid electric brushes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>these are some powerful and great kid electric brushes. my two year old had to get used to it, its pretty strong for a kid toothbrush</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>4yo loves this toothbrush. Batteries last a reasonably long time</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-toothbrush">It&rsquo;s a toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came fast and the kids like them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son love it because of the stickers prizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-4">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-spin-head-is-too-big-for-a-child-to">The spin head is too big for a child to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The spin head is too big for a child to use which makes it hard for them to clean their back teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-only-reason-i-didn-t-give-5-stars-is-because">The only reason I didn&rsquo;t give 5 stars is because &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason I didn&rsquo;t give 5 stars is because I found the toothbrush head a bit bigger than I expected for a kid&rsquo;s toothbrush. It measures <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;.</p>
