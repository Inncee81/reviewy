<p>Optimal Image Stabilization in Any Situation
Intelligent IS automatically chooses from eight different modes to optimize image stabilization for virtually shake-free images in a wide variety of conditions
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX60 HS camera, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you&rsquo;re shooting still images or video.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Easier Tracking and Capture
Zoom Framing Assist and Zoom Memory
Its 65x Optical Zoom lens gives the PowerShot SX60 HS camera the ability to capture subjects at great distances, but because it can be challenging to track a moving subject at maximum telephoto, the camera includes sophisticated technology to help you get the most from the camera&rsquo;s powerful zoom while simply enjoying shooting. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist button, the camera will zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you&rsquo;re ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position. Zoom Framing Assist also lets you select an image area (Face/Upper Body/Whole Body/Manual), then keeps that area of your subject the same size in your frame no matter how the subject moves. For instance, you can tap the Zoom Framing Assist button to detect your subject&rsquo;s face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It&rsquo;s especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children, and for letting a friend take a picture after you&rsquo;ve composed the shot. And, for even more convenience, the Zoom Framing Assist function is also available when shooting video.</p>

<p>A new Zoom Memory function lets you save the zoom position and return to it immediately when you power the camera on. You can also save a Manual Focus position. This is especially convenient at times when you want to power off during short breaks while remaining ready to shoot immediately, for instance if you&rsquo;re waiting for clouds to pass by, or changing the camera&rsquo;s SD card or battery.</p>

<p>Faster Focus for Accuracy, Spontaneity
High Speed AF
The PowerShot SX60 HS camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s remarkably responsive High Speed AF. This High Speed AF technology achieves an increase in speed for quicker start up and a shooting experience that&rsquo;s spontaneous and natural. And a speedier AF means it&rsquo;s possible to photograph fast-moving subjects, which complements the PowerShot SX60 HS&rsquo;s High-Speed Burst HQ mode. You&rsquo;ll capture great shots as they happen – frame by frame – with reduced lag time.</p>

<p>Convenient Shooting Flexibility
Bright 3.0-inch Vari-angle LCD with 922,000 dots for shooting at a variety of angles, plus an Electronic Viewfinder with 922,000 dots for shooting
The PowerShot SX60 HS camera gives you lots of ways to frame a great shot. The bright 3.0-inch Vari-angle LCD has excellent resolution (approximately 922,000 dots), and flips out and swivels/rotates for shooting at unusual angles, even letting you capture perfectly framed self-portraits. The camera also has an Electronic Viewfinder (approximately 922,000 dots) to easily see subjects when using the camera in very bright sunlight, or preventing camera shake by holding it steadily.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Enhanced Grip
The carefully designed grip on the PowerShot SX60 HS camera was specifically developed to make high-magnification shooting easy and accurate. Substantially sized and tall enough for your whole hand to hold securely, the grip is very comfortable and adds a distinctive professional style. The camera&rsquo;s design allows easy access to controls (like access to a convenient front dial), and maximizes camera angle flexibility with the Vari-angle LCD screen to allow you to handle the camera like you would an SLR for optimal control.</p>

<p>Extra Accessories
Experience the PowerShot SX60 HS camera&rsquo;s full potential using accessories that are normally used with EOS DSLR cameras. The PowerShot SX60 HS is compatible with Canon Speedlites, transmitters, and select filter adapters and lens hoods to help maximize the camera&rsquo;s versatility photographers need to achieve their creative vision.</p>

<p>HDR
Shooting in high-contrast environments can often result in photos with overexposed and underexposed sections. To tackle this problem, Canon developed the High Dynamic Range shooting mode to make shooting even more intuitive. Under High Dynamic Range, the camera will shoot three different exposures in a succession (underexposed, overexposed and normal) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa, resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. With the PowerShot SX60 HS camera, a tripod is not always necessary, plus the camera features artistic sub-modes Art Standard, Art Vivid, Art Bold, Art Embossed and Natural, which add dynamic, creative effects depending on the ambience you want to convey.</p>

<p>Creative Shot
Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.</p>

<p>Smart AUTO
Smart AUTO for the PowerShot SX60 HS camera makes it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images and videos you&rsquo;re looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58* predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects and landscapes in the evening or on a bright, snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX60 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.</p>

<ul>
<li>58 predefined shooting situations for still images, and 21 predefined shooting situations for video.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hybrid AUTO
Capture the essence of special days – vacations, important occasions or any time you&rsquo;re shooting many shots in a day – using Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot SX60 HS camera. Hybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the day&rsquo;s clips and pictures* into a video. The feature also makes sure the &ldquo;highlight reel&rdquo; is stunningly beautiful by automatically recognizing the scene and optimizing camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.</p>

<p>I enjoy photographing birds and wildlife, and have a dslr with a medium range (70-300) lens. I was going to rent a longer lens (the new canon 100-400) for an excursion when I saw my rental company had the new Nikon P900 for rent so I decided to try it out. I had great fun with it, and was impressed with the quality of the photos and the zoom reach though I found as others have reported that at the far end the Nikon has trouble acquiring focus and even when it does it is difficult to hold the camera steady enough to avoid blurry images. It seemed the usable range on the Nikon zoom was only about 65x (except when focusing on bright objects that are far away, like the moon), so when I went looking for a superzoom to purchase I settled on the Canon SX 60 hs. I wanted a superzoom that allowed me to shoot in Raw, had a hot shoe, and most importantly, was cheaper than the Nikon. I also liked the fact that the Canon is considerably smaller and lighter than the Nikon P900 (only 22 ounces or 650 grams compared to 33 ounces and 916 grams). However, the added heft made the Nikon a little easier to hold steady when zoomed out to the max.Having used both cameras, I have found that what is said about the two brand&rsquo;s dslrs also holds true with these bridge cameras: the Nikon has the better sensor, and hence better image quality, while the Canon seems to have the edge with autofocus. The Nikon shots were sharper, but the Canon seems much less likely to hunt for focus and re-acqquires it quickly with the frame assist button so you get more shots. The additional zoom is not really an advantage for the Nikon, for reasons mentioned earlier. Also, to my surprise, Canon&rsquo;s 1.6x digital zoom is not as bad as you would expect for digital zoom and rivals the Nikon&rsquo;s shots at 85x zoom on those rare occasions when the Nikon can acquire focus at that length.Some of the shots I posted ate from a recent excursion where I happened to run into a man who had the Canon 100-400 lens on a Canon 7d. We talked about the fact that there weren&rsquo;t a lot of birds out that day, and when I mentioned the grebes and the plover he said that those were &ldquo;too far&rdquo; for his long lens (that costs more than 2k, btw, which is why I only ever can hope to rent it from time to time). We bemoaned the fact that my superzoom wouldn&rsquo;t yield shots of the same quality, but the point is, I DID get shots of the Beebe and plover. The shots do not rival a dslr and a long lens, but my used canon sx60 cost a small fraction of what a long lens would cost, is easy to carry and handhold, and is great for seeing birds and other wildlife at a great distance, though I found with both the Nikon P900 and the Canon SX60 that the sweet spot for great photos is more like 50-35 feet or less. The superzoom allows you to see and capture blurry images at a great distance, but it allows you to fill the frame with subjects that are closer. Both cameras have Wi-fi, which is nice and I was able to get the Canon wi-fi to work by first getting out of range of my own home wi-fi (my phone would automatically disconnect form the camera access point for the stronger and preferred signal from my home router). Below I list some of the pros and cons I have observed in comparing the two cameras:Pros of the Canon SX 60 (vs. Nikon P900)Cost and availabilityLighter weight (though this is also a con, see below)Frame assist and decent auto-focusRaw supportHot shoe for external flashExternal mike jack for video (haven&rsquo;t used this)Plug for remote shutter releaseLens markings to show how far out it is zoomedCons (vs. Nikon P900)Image quality (Nikon&rsquo;s sensor is backside illuminated, as was the Canon SX 50, and that may explain its sharper images)Lighter weight means harder to hold steady when zoomed outNo eye sensor (it is so easy with the Nikon to go from using the viewfinder to the LCD screen though occasionally a stray thumb will trip the sensor. On the Canon, you have to hit the display button twice to switch)The LCD screen seems noisier than the NikonFor now, I am okay with the Canon. If I had an unlimited budget, I might be willing to forgo shooting raw for the Nikon but with either I am able to get some shots I was not able to get with my dslr. I am trying to learn the camera to optimize what I can get from the Canon, and I&rsquo;ll update as I go.</p>

<p>I just got mine, and have been playing with it (and my SX-50) for a couple of hours, particularly indoors without the flash. I had seen some very negative reviews on Amazon, and other places, so I practically didn&rsquo;t even take it out of the box.One site posted some nice pictures that were noisy as all get-out. Their specs with the pictures showed very low ISOs. I took some indoor pictures with low ISOs, and thought, &ldquo;there you go&rdquo;, when I saw the noise. Oddly enough, I tried the camera on auto, and it picked an ISO of 1600. When I looked at the pictures, they had far less noise (almost zero). Even the RAW pictures were practically noise-free. I would say to try other ISO settings than you normally use. It&rsquo;s weird, but this camera seems to take the high ISO settings without skipping a beat. On other cameras, like my SX-40, the pictures would have been all noise, particularly the RAWs, done with the CHDK add-on.The reviews mentioned the lack of an ISO button on the back. When I hit the Function button, it pops me right into the ISO menu, although I may use it less often, considering what I&rsquo;ve found.Other comments had lack of sharpness. For SX-50 users, I tried the same settings on my SX-50, and the SX-60 is noticeably sharper. I&rsquo;ve been going with auto focus, but manual is next.A comment on Amazon said that the zoom motor is loud with movies. Compared to my SX-50, I can barely hear it, so that may have been their camera. I&rsquo;ve found that the buttons take a really light touch to zoom in and out. Otherwise,I can hear my finger clunks when I move the lever, but no motor sounds, just my big fingers. I know that I can use my phone to control the zoom, so that&rsquo;s something to try.All in all, the camera&rsquo;s been a good experience, so far. Enough that I&rsquo;m going to keep it and put it through its paces.I&rsquo;ll keep trying this thing, but my initial impression is very good.</p>
