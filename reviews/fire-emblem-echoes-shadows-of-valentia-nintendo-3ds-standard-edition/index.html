<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="two-sides-of-a-war">Two Sides of a War</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fire Emblem Echoes takes a similar tack to games like Suikoden 3 or Atelier Shallie. The player is given the choice of two main characters, Alm and Celica, as war breaks around them. This enables the player to get a more complete picture of the story as certain events will be unique to one character or another (although they all take place in the same timeline).The gameplay is quite different from most Fire Emblem games. The player no longer has to worry about a weapon triangle (where axes beat lances, anima magic beats light, etc), but must instead look at the statistics of their enemies and use terrain to their advantage. Posting a cavalier or knight on a fortress provides a bonus to evasion and defense, while restoring health every turn. And for players frustrated with the high difficulty, the option of Phoenix Mode (units returning after battle) has been retained.Echoes is a remake of Fire Emblem Gaiden, which was never released in the West. This is an excellent opportunity for fans of the series to enjoy a new tale previously unavailable in English. This remake also includes an extra chapter after Gaiden’s endgame. It’s also the first Fire Emblem tactical game to receive full voice work.Support conversations are a return to Fire Emblem: Blazing Blade (they occur during battles instead of in your castles between missions).</p>

<h5 id="great-for-fans-of-the-fe-series-or-for-fans-of-turn-based-strategy-games">Great for fans of the FE series, or for fans of turn-based strategy games</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good game. If you like Awakening and Fates you should like this. The gameplay is very similar, so veterans of the series shouldn&rsquo;t have trouble learning the ins and outs. There are a few small differences. You don&rsquo;t need special items to change classes, you just need to go to special shrines which are located throughout the game. Characters have default weapons which are not consumed, and special weapons can be equipped, but again, not consumed when used. Your characters can gain affinity with each other but you cannot combine them together into the same space. Visiting towns or dungeons allows you to explore and talk to folks, pick up items, take on sidequests, etc. You can save before or in between battles but not during the battle, so a screw-up will force you to restart the battle from the beginning. Pretty much all dialogue is voice acted, not like previous titles where the character would just say a word or a phrase when speaking their lines. Cutscenes are good and plentiful. I never played the original version of this game, so I&rsquo;m not sure how different it is. I have seen some pics and clips of the original online, and it&rsquo;s obvious they updated the game to make it more like previous DS and 3DS titles. Once again they are offering bunch of extra content in the form of DLC. I believe they sell a season pass for more than the price of the game, which I find ridiculous. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll purchase any of that like I did with Fates.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fe-fans-get-this-game">FE fans, get this game.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An amazing and engaging addition/remake of a classic game/series. New players who came in on Awakenings and Fates might be confused at the lack of romantic options, multiple weapon equipping, hp cost for some spells, and lack of weapon triangle. I saw no issue with any of these, and thus far the game has exceeded my expectations. The dialogue is almost fully voice acted, and you don&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;avatar&rdquo; this time, but two main protagonists whose stories intertwine wonderfully. Job system is slightly different (no seals to choose classes, your class is based on your original class unless you are a &ldquo;starter&rdquo; class called villiager) and the implementation of dungeons bring an intriguing style of gameplay to break the monotony. Definitely shaping up to be one of my favorite FE games. Nintendo knocked it out the park with this remake.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="truly-fantastic-f-e-game">Truly fantastic F/E game</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m just now writing this because I wanted to complete the game before posting. This summer I finally got the resources together to collect all the Fire Emblem games playable in English (including 2 emulated translated Japan only games). Right in the middle of playing Ike&rsquo;s 1st game path of radiance, Shadows of Valentia released. And I found it difficult to pull myself away from this new game. It has so many technical advantages over the older games (fully voiced is a beautiful thing) yet under the advancements is a true Fire Emblem game. I played 68 hrs and 52 mins overall (including some DLC) but the story and characters captured my attention and heart right away. Faye will never be with Alm, but she&rsquo;s still the cutest in my option! All in all this is a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> game for the series and the DS console!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-new-old-favorite">A New-Old Favorite</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An excellent expansion of Gaiden, which I never played. The story was mostly pretty transparent, but the gameplay (Classic/Hard with 0 casualties especially) is old-style Fire Emblem, with the Turnwheel and 3-use revival springs making this still less punishing than the other permadeath games. Removing the whole shipping characters thing lets us return to just focusing on getting everybody through alive against sometimes frankly ridiculous numbers or abilities on the other side. Just what I like in a Fire Emblem. Haven&rsquo;t found a DLC that&rsquo;s my favorite yet, but the bonus boss in the postgame is pretty harsh. Save those revival springs for after fighting him!Do it. It&rsquo;s different enough to be refreshing, and old-Fire-Emblem enough to satisfy challenge-seekers. (Try it without the Turnwheel if you are one.) I personally don&rsquo;t see anywhere near as much replay value as Fates, sadly. If I felt drawn back to this after finishing, I&rsquo;m sure it could just keep on making me very happy. Savor it.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-playing-the-fire-emblem-series-of-games">I love playing the Fire Emblem series of games</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love playing the Fire Emblem series of games. I have been playing them since I was introduced to it on the Game Boy Advance. These are a great example of turn-based strategy that is found in the Advanced Wars series as well. The Medieval setting of this game is very interesting and I am really enjoying the use of the system that is in this game as well as the different characters and story elements. The Nintnedo 3DS has featured 3 of the best in the series so far. Fire Emblem Awakening, Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest and now Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadow of Valentia.</p>
