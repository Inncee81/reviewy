<h5 id="mount-it-one-foot-high-pointed-towards-the-tailpipes-it-will-work-nearly-perfectly">Mount it one foot high pointed towards the tailpipes; it will work nearly perfectly!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The long and short: Mount it one foot off the ground pointed towards the tailpipes, and it will work nearly 100% of the time, no matter the temperature or weather.Chamberlain&rsquo;s printed directions want you to mount this sensor four feet off the ground pointed towards the hood of vehicles. However, when we followed Chamberlain&rsquo;s directions, our detection rates were around 50%-60%, with lower vehicles being missed. On rainy or cold days, the detection rate was nearly 0% for any vehicle.We were about to send the sensor back. However, after taking the suggestion of another reviewer here, we mounted it one foot off the ground and pointed it towards the tailpipes, and it has detected flawlessly! It previously would not detect on cold days or rainy days, but now it detects whether rain, shine, or cold. Vehicle size is also no longer an issue since it now detects any size vehicle. Chamberlain should really update their printed directions to reflect this improved method of detection because their four-foot method simply does not work, which leads to many product returns and unhappy customers. It should be a five-star product, but until Chamberlain updates their directions, four stars is all we can give it.</p>

<h5 id="busted-2-prowlers-caught-in-the-act">Busted! 2 Prowlers caught in the act</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My back wall was pretty low so a few months ago I purchased a few of these up against my back wall. I didn&rsquo;t want them going on and off all day long so I put a timer on the receiver to turn on between 10pm-5am. I used a smart things hub and an cord I can control but any timer would do. Once in a while I&rsquo;d get a cat walking past one, but not too often to annoy me.I installed drop cams so I could check out what the motion was when I was alerted.In August at 5:30 am the sensors were constantly going off. I pulled out my phone and checked the dropcams, and there were two prowlers. I immediately called 911 and they were picked up within 9 minutes of my call.These are excellent sensors and I highly recommend them. Cameras are great, but more often than not useless for catching the bad guys. Get the bad guys in the act, and get alerted of their presence so you can protect you and your love ones.</p>

<h5 id="works-fine">works fine !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have read several negative reviews about the Chamberlain CWA2000 Wireless Motion Alert system&hellip; many of which compared it to its predecessor. I have used the former version with success for 3 years and I was disappointed that it had been discontinued and replaced with this model and that it was not compatible with my old sensors.Despite the negative reviews -mostly about the low volume of the base station - I decided to purchase one anyhow because the price is so attractive. I figured I would send it back if I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied. It works fine! The old model allowed the base station to be put on mute for one hour. That feature no longer exists - but the sound can be raised or lowered which helps compensate if someone will be working in one of my remote buildings - tripping the sensor repeatedly - which is when we would use the mute feature. Another new feature that I haven&rsquo;t tested yet is that this new version can handle 8 sensors, each with a unique signal [1 beep - 8 beeps]. Its predecessor could only be trained for 4.I live in a heavily wooded &amp; hilly location with a very long driveway and several outbuildings that need to be protected. This unit will work for 300-400+ yards dependably. The volume is adjustable and is certainly audible all over my house. The earlier units may have been &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; because the base station makes plenty of noise now. I suggest buying several base stations and training them all to the same codes [1 beep for driveway, 2 beeps for shed, 3 beeps for outside the garage, 4 beeps for inside the garage, etc.]. I also strongly recommend that you use lithium batteries for the sensors if they are to be used in a location where the temperature goes below 20degrees F. Alkaline batteries freeze around 15 degrees F; lithium&rsquo;s are good to 20 below zero F. Another trick I use is to put two sensors on my driveway just in case the first one misses. It&rsquo;s my &ldquo;fail safe&rdquo;. Try these and have some patience in deciding where you will place the sensors. Don&rsquo;t point them towards the sun or prevailing snow storms winds. Use lithium&rsquo;s and expect 10+ months out of each set of AA batteries.</p>

<h5 id="well-you-decide">Well, you decide?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Your level of satisfaction with this product will be based solely on your application.First, let me explain how this product works.This product senses motion between two different temperatures. The outside air and anything warmer or cooler than that air. So, thankfully swaying tree branches do not trigger it.If you&rsquo;re looking to be alerted to humans or animals, this product does that very well.If you&rsquo;re looking to be alerted to vehicles (which is why I bought it) there will be some limitations&hellip;Because the vehicles exterior is usually the same temperature as the outside, it&rsquo;s more difficult to detect a vehicle.The trick is to point the unit so it sees the rear of the vehicle as it passes. Hopefully it glimpses the tailpipe which is always hot.On a dry day, detection is good. Rainy days, snowy days and some cold days where the vehicles sheetmetal is exposed to those elements thus, the same temperature as the outside, detection is almost non-existant.So, depending on your application&hellip; It&rsquo;s a good unit based on what you expect it to do.If you want to flawlessly detect vehicles, consider an alert system with a sensor that detects metal rather than movement.Good Shopping!</p>
