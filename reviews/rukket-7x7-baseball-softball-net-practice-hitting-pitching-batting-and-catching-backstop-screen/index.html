<p>Rukket Sports 7 x 7 Baseball &amp; Softball Practice Net with Bow Frame (Lifetime Warranty) Rukket Sports: Leader in Baseball and Softball Training Gear Rukket Sports&rsquo; baseball and softball hitting nets and training products outscore their opponents 1 Million to Zero! Join the winning team and get your team on the way to winning or continue those winning ways with Rukket! Cutting-Edge and Saves You Money and Time This innovative and affordable 7x7 baseball net is a durable and portable baseball and softball training net perfect for tee-ball practice, in-field practice, soft-toss, and softball and baseball pitching practice. The uniquely designed bow frame allows the slight bend of the poles to give more flex and the result is a sturdy structural net that will take on all levels of pitching, throwing, and hitting stress. Competitors Nets are Inferior Quality Typical baseball and softball nets are bulky, heavy to move and potentially unsafe. Not to mention most field facilities are limited, forcing coaches to share and split time with other teams. Other nets available for purchase on the market carry a pretty hefty price tag, are made of inferior material, and can still be a burden when it comes to maneuverability and ease of use. Lifetime Warranty: We follow through on our promise to offer the best customer service to you! LIFETIME WARRANTY: Purchase with full confidence knowing that should you find anything defective for the life of the product, we will ship replacement parts free of cost promptly. We stand behind our commitment to delivering the best quality with the best value and follow it up with the best customer service. Need help or have a question?

<h5 id="practice-net-bliss">Practice Net Bliss</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product has exceeded my expectations. Everything was well made and well finished and it allwent together smoothly and without a hitch. Easy to put up and easy to take down.We have had it set up in the garage due to the bad weather and it has been working like a champsucking up softballs and giving our 12U daughter some needed hitting practice. It is worth everypenny spent on it and I believe that it will give us good service for couple of seasons, at least.The only criticism of the net that I might have is that the areas where the net &ldquo;sock&rdquo; is sewn tothe main part of the net the netting material attachment points look a little thin. So far the net hashad a pretty good pounding from softballs and I see no problem with it. I&rsquo;m sure that Rukket haseyeballed this themselves and likely determined that it is not an issue. Especially in light oftheir unusual and refreshing lifetime guarantee.One suggestion that I would like to make to Rukket is that they include a couple of square feetof scrap netting (left over from the manufacturing process) with the net so that when a hole doesget in the net from carelessness or general wear and tear, a piece could be cut from the scrapnetting to be used as a repair patch. I guess that it could be sewn or woven in but I would try anoverlay with super glue type gel. This would help Rukket get rid of some scrap without puttingit in a landfill and offer a neat looking repair to the net itself.Very happy with the Rukket Sock It and recommend it without reservation.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-m-very-satisfied-with-my-purchase-and-the-best-thing-is">I&rsquo;m VERY satisfied with my purchase and the best thing is</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this item for practice, obviously, we set it up behind 2nd base when we are hitting to allow the outfielders a target to throw at, instead of having a bunch of loose balls behind the pitcher (we don&rsquo;t normally have a full team in practice as we are adults hitting softballs). This net has taken a few liners off the poles, some hard throw balls off the poles and thus far has held up exquisitely. I&rsquo;m VERY satisfied with my purchase and the best thing is, the carry back has plenty of room for a few other odds and ends, I stash a bat and ball in the bag just in case I forget stuff. Cant wait to set it up over at 1st and start getting some throwing in, as a SS I need to have accurate throws and that is the main reason why I purchased a net. The 7x7 might be a little small for slowpitch hitting as you generally want the ball to be up at chest level off of a tee. I have zero complaints, and am impressed with the quality and easy of set up, excess space in the carry bag, and durability thus far. Half the price of a Bownet without any real compromise.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-customer-service-and-product-warranty">Great customer service and product warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After much research and the lifetime warranty, I decided to purchased a Rukket Sports 7 x 7 Baseball &amp; Softball Bow Frame Net for baseball practice with my 10 year old son. After using it 4 times I noticed the seam on the carrying bag have split open and there were some wear and tear signs around the netting pocket and I decided contacted Jon from Rukket via Amazon. To my surprise after couple email exchange and pictures Jon replaced the entire setup for me. I am very pleased with the service that I have received from Jon as well as their product warranty. I will definitely do business with Rukket again.Pros:The unit is very easy to assemble and disassemble.Fairly sturdy, it holds up well with my 10 year old and he has a strong arm.Great customer service and outstanding product warranty.Cons.The carrying bag will not last, I wish it was made up of heavier canvas.The handles on the carrying bag is too long, it makes it hard to carry and if you sling it over your shoulders after few bounces it will rip the seam open.The netting seems to be okay, but the knotts around the pockets could be more attentive.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="well-made-holding-up-nicely">Well Made. Holding Up Nicely.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had my reservations regarding this product since I&rsquo;ve never heard of the name before but I&rsquo;ve gotta say, it&rsquo;s been holding up nicely.The main reason I purchased this is to allow my son to throw pitches into the net by himself when I&rsquo;m not there to help catch. The pocket at the end that catches the balls making it easier to retrieve. At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure which side was up but the velcro ties into the bottom pole so I figured it out pretty quickly. This makes assembly/disassembly a snap. Materials seem pretty durable and I like the fact that it comes with a bag to put it all in. The net is also well made and pretty thick stitching.I have not had him hit into the net yet but he&rsquo;s only 10 so I don&rsquo;t think he could move the net very far (if at all) if he were to hit against it.For those considering a 5&rsquo; net, don&rsquo;t bother. Get the 7&rsquo; net. Even at this much coverage, there are still a (very) few strays so I can only imagine how it would be on something half the size (esp if you&rsquo;re hitting). (Assuming 7x7 vs 5x5 but you get the point).The lifetime warranty makes this a no brainer too! Assuming they follow through of course.Altogether I&rsquo;m liking this product so far.READ MORE</p>
