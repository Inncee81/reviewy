<p>Not a true 128gb. I tested with a program and it show about 8gb. When you put in your device it will show as 128gb.</p>

<p>This product is not working, it is a lie. Do not buy this.</p>

<h5 id="fraud">Fraud</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wheres the 128? Not here, for sure Works but is no where near the capacity advertised. False advertising. Waste of money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was very disappointed that after just opening this today to use for the first time, it wouldn&rsquo;t work at all in any device, with or without the adapter. Tried on 3 different laptops, 3 tablets, 5 smartphones, and several cameras. All run across different different operating systems and platforms. None could read it to even recognize it was in the device so it couldn&rsquo;t get mounted or formatted at all. I repair and build electronics as my profession, so it was thoroughly checked.</p>

<h5 id="this-card-keeps-popping-up-under-new-listings-but-it-remains-just-as-fake-read-carefully-before-considering-a-purchase">This card keeps popping up under new listings, but it remains just as fake. (Read carefully before considering a purchase.)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before buying, you should look at some of the reviews from an earlier listing of this identical card - &ldquo;128GB Micro SD SDXC TF Memory Card 128gb High Speed High Quality Class 10 With Micro SD Adapter.For about $35 to $40 you can buy 128GB of real memory. For about half that, you are certain to get a hacked, fake-capacity card that will seem to work at first, but will eventually destroy some or all of your valuable data.YOUR DATA IS AT RISK. Read on&hellip;Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage. However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back. Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.Be especially wary of cards with a stated capacity of 64GB or above marked as &ldquo;SDHC&rdquo; (not &ldquo;SDXC&rdquo;). The SD card association controls and licenses the SD card standards and they define &ldquo;SDHC&rdquo; up to a maximum capacity of 32GB. For larger capacity cards, only the &ldquo;SDXC&rdquo; standard is valid.Good 128GB SD cards are out there, but they will conform to the SDXC standard and will be clearly marked as such. Expect to pay roughly $18 and up for 64GB (as of Q4 2016) and about twice that for 128GB cards.If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient.You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then <em>most importantly</em> check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.Search for &ldquo;fake capacity flash&rdquo; using your favorite search engine for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was excited when I saw these for the price I bought two. Garbage is what it is they show 125gb out of 128gb. That is normal. The abnormal part is when you write files to them they disappear. If I could rate in negative I would. Amazon should pull these</p>

<p>Fake Micro SD. Don&rsquo;t buy this piece of junk. It isn&rsquo;t 128GB as it is advertised and described. Its 6GB. If you try to store any files in this fake micro SD, they will be lost or corrupted. Read all the reviews and all are saying the same. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this piece of junk, but lesson learned.</p>
