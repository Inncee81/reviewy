<h5 id="i-decided-to-gear-down-and-sell-all-of-my-nikon-equipment-and-buy-a-good-point-and-shoot">I decided to gear down and sell all of my Nikon equipment and buy a good point and shoot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My situation may be a little different than some others on this forum. My first DSLR was a Nikon D90 and then I moved to a D7000. I had assorted Nikon lenses and equipment and having reached age 70, I decided to gear down and sell all of my Nikon equipment and buy a good point and shoot. After looking into everything that was available in the point n shoot world, I realized that nothing would take the place of of my D7000; that is until the D5500 was introduced. Between its amazingly light weight, articulating touch screen LCD, WiFi, uniformly positive reviews, light weight collapsing 18-55 vr2 and 55-200vr lenses, as well as an under $1000 price point, I decided that this could be the answer for my purposes as a perfect all around consumer camera. Bottom line, I love this camera and as it has turned out being everything that I had hoped for and more. Beautiful pictures, simple to use, and easy to haul around; there just isn&rsquo;t any downside to owning this camera. Hope this has helped make someones decision a little easier - you just can&rsquo;t go wrong with the D5500.</p>

<h5 id="the-camera-i-ve-been-waiting-for">The Camera I&rsquo;ve Been Waiting For</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the camera I&rsquo;ve been looking for.My interest in photography goes way back, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I got my first iPhone (the 4S) that I was able to start exploring. From there, I bought a Fuji HS30EXR, which was very highly recommended, and had awful image quality; next, I purchased a Sony NEX-6, which was light-years ahead of the Fuji, but I always felt like something was missing. So I bought the Sony a6000 and suffered immediate buyer&rsquo;s remorse (though I eventually bought its little brother, the RX100 m2, which is my much-loved coat-pocket camera). I was always looking for that missing something. And not being trained at all in photography, never having taken any classes, and having to learn everything on my own from books and websites, I could never put my finger on what that something was. Until I discovered the D5500.The D5500 takes great pictures. It&rsquo;s also harder to use than the a6000. But it feels like a real camera. It&rsquo;s comfortable in my (somewhat large) hands. Compared to the CSC Sony cameras I&rsquo;ve owned, it feels more like a tool than a toy. As I say, it&rsquo;s more challenging to use (no Focus Peaking!), and as a result, I&rsquo;m more satisfied when I take a decent exposure. And it is sharp, in part because modern Nikons lack anti-aliasing filters. An Anti-Aliasing Filter serves to soften your images to prevent moiré- a sort of banding that occurs in high-contrast patterns (think a striped dress) when recorded by a digital sensor. (You may have seen these patterns on an old tube t.v. screen when you were a kid, too.) In my opinion, the benefit of having 24mp is not that you necessarily get a &ldquo;better&rdquo; image- you get more room to crop. I like to take pictures of the moon, and it&rsquo;s nice to be able to zoom in and inspect the surface. The Sony&rsquo;s were way too soft when zoomed in at 50%, let alone 100%. This may not be the case for the full-frame Sony cameras, but the APS-C models leave a lot to be desired. As far as those cameras are concerned, 24mp is about 16mp wasted.The D5500 feels great in hand, nice and light, but still substantial, with a good amount of grip, and it truly is optimized to help amatuers like me get the shot they want. It&rsquo;s fast (though not as quick in burst mode as the a6000), and the touchscreen is a treat coming from Sony (menus within menus within menus within menus&hellip;), making it super easy to change aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc. The lens selection is fantastic, whether you go Nikon or third-party (I&rsquo;ve already added the AF-S 35mm and the 55-200mm VRII to my bag), although there is an obvious emphasis on pro gear.The D5500 is the camera for me. Every single box (image quality, feel, looks) is neatly checked. I find myself spending less time in Lightroom and more time with a camera in my hands, and I find that leaving things like ISO up to the camera (unthinkable on Sony&rsquo;s APS-C cameras, which render unusable images after ISO 6400 or so) not only renders great images, but makes it that much easier (and enjoyable) for me to bungle my way through this silly, expensive hobby of mine. I would recommend this camera to everyone who wants to go beyond smartphones and point-and-shoots.Side note- I chose the D5500 over the D7200 for several reasons that you may or may not agree with, but here they are:1. The D5500 and the D7200 have the same sensor. IQ should be the same.2. The D7200 is $400 more. Although I love my D5500, I will probably not be as fond of it in three or four years. But the lenses could conceivably last for decades with proper care. As better photographers than me have said, buy only as much camera as you need, and spend the rest on lenses.3. Simpler exterior. I&rsquo;m not ready for all the buttons and dials yet. Stepping up to the D7000 series will be next, but that&rsquo;s several years from now. I felt it was better to become accustomed to the DSLR form factor before dropping $1100 on the camera body alone.As far as the Nikon vs. Canon debate is concerned, I&rsquo;m uninterested. I chose the D5500 over the comparable Canons for a couple of reasons.1. Nikon bodies seem to cost less than their Canon counterparts, but are rated more highly; the Canon t6s is more expensive and does not perform as well. Ditto the 70d.2. Nikon has legacy lens support unmatched by Canon. Will I ever take advantage of it? Who knows, but I like the idea.3. Canon DSLR&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t render color as well, in my opinion, Easy fix, I know- but still.That being said, I&rsquo;m certain that a skilled photographer could get great pictures from just about anything, so don&rsquo;t get yourself bogged down in fruitless Nikon vs. Canon, DSLR vs. Mirrorless/M43, Android vs. Apple type debates. Just take pictures!</p>

<h5 id="very-similar-to-the-nikon-d5300">Very Similar to the Nikon D5300</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nikon D5500 is a smaller/lighter version of the the D5300 (They skipped over the D5400). The Image Quality and Features appear almost identical; the only added feature I have spotted is the new touch screen. I am not personally a touch screen fan so this is not that big a deal for me. Obviously for those that do prefer a touch screen interface, this would be an important feature.The body is definitely smaller and lighter than the D5300. This is really a small and lightweight DSLR especially when using the bundled 18-55mm collapsible lens. However, The camera stills feels very solid and I think that the grip has actually improved. The size and weight is now comparable to the D3300. By the way, there would now seem to be very little reason to consider the D3300 (beyond the fact that is cheaper) as the only advantage the D3300 held over the D5xx series was its size and weight. The D5500 is about the same size and weight (perhaps even a bit lighter but I can&rsquo;t say for sure) as the D3300 but has several more features including a fully articulating screen, bracketing, DOF preview, better high ISO performance and more ISO options, etc. The D5500 is the same size as some compact system cameras with the important advantages of better High ISO shooting and an optical viewfinder. I believe it is the smallest/lightest DSLR with an articulating screen.Like the D5300, High ISO and Autofocus performance is very, very good. ISO 800 is really indistinguishable from ISO 100. ISO 1600 is also very good with some graininess/noise creeping in. ISO 3200, and even ISO 6400, are usable but there is a definite degradation in image quality especially at ISO 6400. .JPGs are a little soft even after making in-camera adjustments; Shooting Raw and using Nikon&rsquo;s very good Image Editing software can enhance the photos quite a bit. Like almost all cameras, the built in flash is not great; an external speedlight with bounce capabilities is really essential for properly exposed photographs (or alternatively not using a flash at all and shooting at a higher ISO/slower shutter speed). There is no dedicated WB or ISO button (although the FN button can be programmed for one of those or some other functions).The only real issue I have with this camera (and all Nikon DSLRs since they switched from a CCD to CMOS sensor) is the orangish shift by the Automatic While Balance when shooting indoors under artificial lighting. Using a higher kelvin# (which cannot be accessed directly, you have to use a preset such as &ldquo;sunny&rdquo;) helps somewhat. Using &ldquo;preset&rdquo; Whie Balance (manually measuring the WB using a white sheet of paper) improves the WB a lot. But if you really care about accurate AWB, take a look at the older Nikon DSLRs such as the D40x or D80. The tradeoffs of course would be significant loss of megapixels (not that important really) and high ISO performance.Overall, this is a great DSLR in a smaller/lighter package. Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer.</p>
