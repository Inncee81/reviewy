<h5 id="so-far-this-machine-is-awesome">So far this machine is awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really hesitant about ordering this dryer because of some of the negative reviews. I got this thing home, plugged it in and went to testing it right away. I put a full load from my 2.1 cubic foot RCA portable washer and was blown away by how well this thing dried. The load included jeans and towels and the thing still dried everything in about 45 minutes. The air did get decently hot, not just warm. Maybe there are some defective units out there or something. I&rsquo;ll update later, sooner if I run into any issues. So far this machine is awesome!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-has-a-hot-and-cool-drying-selection-with-the-timer-running-from-0-to">It has a hot and cool drying selection with the timer running from 0 to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This small dryer has been a life saver. I live in a apartment complex with a very limited wash room. I purchased this dryer along with a portable washer. It has saved me time (and sanity lol) of going back and forth. As well as having to wait for neighbors to finish in order to take care of laundry. It&rsquo;s large enough to dry a full load. But small enough to fit in my dining room without taking too much space. It has a hot and cool drying selection with the timer running from 0 to 120 minutes. It also has a vent in the back. Which when I run the dryer I simply open my dining room window to let the heat out. The plug is a 3 prong plug in which can be plugged into any standard wall socket. And running the dry has not put a dent in my energy bill.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-dryer">Love this dryer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this dryer, don&rsquo;t judge but I bought so I do not have to lug laundry from basement everyday. It is in spare room on the same floor as every bedroom is so I just pick up clothes, wash, dry, no steps. Big stuff goes down to the basement to the regular washer/dryer. I like that it has a &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or air dry setting so that it does not heat up the room but obviously that takes much longer and I have not had it long enough to see the utility bill effect. As long as you don&rsquo;t overload it, clean the filter, and give it plenty of room to vent this is a great little dryer.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-dryer-for-rv">Great Dryer For RV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to be installed in my 5th wheel travel trailer. I have 30 amp service in my trailer and I was a bit skeptical about how this unit would work out. The other consideration with purchasing this unit was the fact that it would need to be vented outside in an RV application. I suppose that one could run the dryer inside without venting but this seemed a bad idea especially on a hot summers day, not to mention all the added humidity that reeks havoc on your RV&rsquo;s interior. Venting inside your home is a different story.I found an installation location on the wall of my 5th wheel near a power source. The instructions were easy to understand. Additional thought regarding mounting in an RV situation is required. Every RV installation is different but I would definitely recommend a thought process for extra support above and beyond what the instructions suggest for home use. Traveling down the highway creates bumps and vibrations that typically don&rsquo;t happen with home use. I built a small shelving unit beneath the dryer for added support and storage of laundry supplies as well as additional wall attachment support to accomplish this.Drilling a 4&rdquo; vent hole for venting in the side of my 5th wheel seemed daunting but it turns out that it was not a huge deal at all. I measured and then triple checked the measurements again before drilling. Home depot had all the necessary adapters and outside venting components needed to complete the job.The dryer runs on basically 2 heat settings. The lower heat setting takes longer to dry but the up side is that I can run my A/C unit while using the dryer. The higher heat setting works very well and on most days with an outside temp of 80 degree or less I can run the dryer and A/C together but I have to put my A/C on low speed or shut it off all together. Not a big deal for me.We have taken 6 trips since installing this dryer and I am very pleased with quality of the unit. It is so nice not to have to use public washers and dryers when traveling. I paired this dryer with a small fully automatic washer from The Laundry Alternative.READ MORE</p>

<p>What a great portable dryer! I have a magic chef set! Soo in love with it! They pack it very well! I have a avanti bracket shelf and this dryer fits perfectly on it! Now I have my mini laundry!! THANK YOU AMAZON FOR PROVIDING THE BEST THINGS FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-for-small-spaces">Great for small spaces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit apprehensive about this dryer but made the decision to try it. I do not regret it. I discarded the round felt part of the lint trap. It doesnâ€™t seem necessary and is impossible to clean. It doesnâ€™t seem to heat my small bathroom at all nor add any humidity that is noticeable. It holds more than I expected. I have a small Panda washer and it makes the perfect sidekick. The sensor that is supposed to stop it when the clothes are dry doesnâ€™t seem to work. But Iâ€™ve never had one work as advertised so I canâ€™t fault it for that. Besides I like to put my clothes in to warm up while I shower.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="its-a-steal">Its a Steal!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lil guy is GREAT! It was just delivered today. Prime/UPS did a great job of getting it to me on time. I knew when it was coming so I did a load of towels in my tiny washer and it took about an hour on high, to get them all dry. Didn&rsquo;t weigh much so I was able to hurl it onto my shelves (pictured) and connect standard sized vent tubing to it. It&rsquo;s very quiet. I would recommend venting it because the load of towels I did made it extremely muggy in my apartment (probably not good for electronics). My only complaint so far is the way the lent trap is positioned, but so far I am incredibly impressed. I was hang drying post divorce, and now I have a dryer! So cute! So proud!READ MORE</p>
