<h5 id="great-device-to-have-especially-for-the-price">GREAT device to have, especially for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this little guy! It&rsquo;s my second SD card-to-flash drive that I&rsquo;ve had. The last one was cheaper, but it also looked the part. This one, on the other hand, looks professional, sturdy, and lightweight. It&rsquo;s small enough to stay out of the way, but big enough to look good in use.I don&rsquo;t use SD or MicroSD cards much any more like I did in college, but when my girlfriend&rsquo;s Android freaked out and corrupted her entire Micro SD card (I think that&rsquo;s what it was), I told her to let me borrow it. Using this card reader, I was able to plug her Micro SD into my computer, and, with the card still in the reader, ran a data recovery program that rebuilt all her photos that weren&rsquo;t corrupted. The reader got warm from the process (file recovery takes a couple hours and strains the drive that the data is on), but this little guy held in there like a pro. My girlfriend ended up not losing a single file.Like I said, I don&rsquo;t use card readers very often any more, but this is one of those things that I feel like everyone should have in case of an emergency, like needing to download photos after a digital camera&rsquo;s computer cable is lost, or when you need to get files off an Android. It&rsquo;s less than $10, and it&rsquo;s worth it to have one if and when it&rsquo;s needed right away.I&rsquo;ve had good experience with the brand (Anker) in the past as well. They have really small, minimalistic packaging, but they also don&rsquo;t seem too &ldquo;businesslike&rdquo; as a company. At my old job we purchased several &ldquo;4-Port Aluminum USB 3.0 Hubs&rdquo;, one for every web designer and web developer, since plugging hard drives and flash drives in and out was necessary many times per day. I don&rsquo;t recall ever having issues with any of them.Anyway, I&rsquo;m actually going to go browse their other products now haha. Hope my review helped!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="pretty-good-with-a-couple-notes">Pretty good, with a couple notes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to be able to throw in my bag-of-tricks work bag.The unit is nice and compact.The Micro SD cards fit deep and well in this.Better than their &ldquo;USB 3.0 Multi-in-1 Card Reader&rdquo;.The SD slot is a little sloppy and the card goes in upside down, so just keep that in mind.The reader seems to function fine.Two other things that may be of concern.The reader required a bit of force to plug into the drive bay which consequently, is also a &ldquo;AnkerÂ® 3.5 inch Front Panel USB Hub with 2 USB 3.0&rdquo;.It would have been nice if Anker included a cover to go over the USB end.Since it doesn&rsquo;t have a cover, I will probably throw it in a tiny zip-lock bag or try to find a USB stick where I can steal the cover from.All that being said, for the price you can&rsquo;t beat it.They will send you an email direct saying your order shipped, and if any problem arises contact them.I have bought several Anker products lately.I think their quality and price is better than most.When I have left non-favorable reviews, they immediately contact me to rectify the situation.Their support in better than any company I can recall to date.So if you want a good quality product at a fair price with excellent support, Anker is your best choice.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-little-adapter-for-writing-raspberry-pi-boot-images-to-microsd">Great little adapter for writing Raspberry Pi boot images to MicroSD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As always, huge fan of Anker. Years ago SanDisk used to include a USB MicroSD adapter with their cards&hellip; I have 2 of them laying around, but they were 2.0. Lately I have been doing a lot of image writes for the Libre LePotato (Raspberry Pi type board) testing images on top of testing images. Constantly writing those at 2.0 was taking longer than it should have, so I went searching for a 3.0 adapter. Using Win32DiskImager, I shaved off almost a minute in writing to my Lexar 633 card. At 2.0 I was averaging about 5 minutes per boot image and up to 7 minutes using an old MicroSD card. So getting that down in the 4 minute range was a plus. So all in all, I am happy with the 3.0</p>

<h5 id="arcs-shuts-down-usb-ports-and-erases-sd-cards-i-d-avoid-it">Arcs, shuts down USB ports, and erases SD cards. I&rsquo;d avoid it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this cause it was an Anker product, but I must&rsquo;ve gotten a bad one. It&rsquo;s erasing my SD cards every time I plug them in to the PC giving a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; error. I can&rsquo;t get it to copy the NOOBS offline install without it failing during the copy but I can format it and get it to copy NOOBS lite and then use the SD card in my pi up until I need to plug it into the PC. I&rsquo;ve seen it arc when plugging it in and that makes the PC or laptop shut off the USB port and you have to go in and renable it. For $10 I won&rsquo;t even bother returning it, I just won&rsquo;t get another Anker SD card reader.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-value-for-plug-and-play-sd-microsd-card-reader">A great value for plug-and-play SD/microSD card reader</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A simple, plug-and-play, no fuss card reader for SD and microSD sizes (the most common formats). I was considering one of the million-in-one, every-format-known-to-man card reader instead of this, but that wasn&rsquo;t really practical because these are the only two formats I use. No regrets on that decision so far.Pros:- Classy, simple design- USB 3.0 for higher transfer speed limit- Can read two cards simultaneously (mounts as two individual cards)- LED status light- Low costCons:- Only two formats, but at least they are the most common- No cap or retractable USB plug- Orientation for inserting cards is not labeled- microSD cards can be challenging to insertREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-product">Love This Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product as - due to my poor attention to detail - I ruined the SD card slot on my laptop (while the slot worked great for reading SD cards, it clearly was inadequate for the deluge of melted ice cream that I cascaded over and through it), After using this product on both a daily and weekly basis since the purchase on 9/30/17, I can truly say it has both met and exceeded all of my expectations! And, because of the purchase price, it has got to be one of the best values I have ever seen! I highly recommend this product (especially for those who - like me - as a result of poor attention to detail, render electronic devices as nonfunctional!).</p>
