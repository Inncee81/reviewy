These cards and are built with UHS-1 (Ultra High Speed) bus interfaces for getting the optimal performance out of your camera/camcorder.

To ensure compatibility, look for the SDHC logo on the packaging. Please check with your device manufacturer for their current/future supported SDHC devices.</p>

<h5 id="93-53mb-s-sequential-reads-and-56-63mb-s-sequential-writes">93.53MB/s sequential reads and 56.63MB/s sequential writes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, very fast, no compatibility issues with devices that support SDXC. Was able to do 93.53MB/s sequential reads and 56.63MB/s sequential writes. The random writes are slower, so this wouldn&rsquo;t be great for an OS (like a Raspberry Pi). But perfectly designed and very fast for a camera recording images or video.</p>

<h5 id="alert-these-may-not-be-truly-uhs-i-u3">ALERT! These may not be truly UHS-I U3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I purchase this in order to record 4k on my Sony AX33 using the 100mbs for the highest quality 4k (vs 60mbs). I install the card and I set to 100mbs but, receive a message that I must install a U3 card. That is what I purchased. I did some research online and found a reference where some where having the same issue and others were not. I decided to go to a local store and I found the exact same PNY SD card. I purchased it and tried it at home. Well guess what? It worked! Not errors. I looked at both packages in great detail and only found a few differences. Note the pictures: The SD card on the right DOES work as a UHS-I U3 @ 100mbs the one on the left I purchased from amazon and is NOT recognized as a UHS-I U3. I have attached a video demonstrating the error I receive when trying to use one over the other.PNY Elite Performance 64 GB High Speed SDXC Class 10 UHS-I, U3 up to 95 MB/Sec Flash Card (P-SDX64U395-GE)</p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-hit-or-a-miss-with-these-cards">It&rsquo;s a hit or a miss with these cards. &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hit or a miss with these cards. I use them in my Nikon Cameras and I hadn&rsquo;t had any issues with these cards until I purchased them recently. I&rsquo;ve had a pair of these for about a year and a half and decided that I needed to buy a couple more. Well the ones that came in couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the camera and when your a shoot, that&rsquo;s the last thing you need. I sent them back and received the replacements and they&rsquo;ve been working okay until today. This is why I&rsquo;m writing this review. I don&rsquo;t have a really new camera but it&rsquo;s always worked can&rsquo;t say the same about these cards. Very disappointing&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-2013-mac-book-pro-music-and-pictures">Perfect for my 2013 Mac Book Pro Music and Pictures</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did my research and it paid off! This just expanded my 2013 Mac Book Pro by 50%! To test, I ran Disk Speed Check from Blackmagicdesign. I get 86MB/s read and 15MB/s write speeds. By comparison, the internal drive gets 350MB/s read and 150MB/s write speeds. So, I&rsquo;m using this to store all of my photos and music which frees up my faster internal drive for more demanding tasks. The more expensive SD cards warn about this catching on things, but I beg to differ. It only sticks out by about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;, it is firmly seated, and it it on the side of the computer not the front or back which slides into the bag. There is no chance of this catching on anything.</p>

<h5 id="great-card-at-a-great-price-90-mb-s-reads-and-60-mb-s-writes-what-else-could-you-ask-for">Great card at a Great Price!!!! 90+Mb/s reads and 60+Mb/s writes, what else could you ask for???</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this to use in my Lenovo Y510P, which has a SD card slot that flush mount a card, so why not add some more SSD storage? I was considering the 512GB, but for the price, this was much better at the time (Mar2016). Mine benched a little better than the other posted, with 4k blocks I got 90GB reads and 64GB writes. On 8k blocks it was the same as the other poster.PNY has the lifetime warranty too, which is also a nice feature, especially with a card this size, it should be useful for years to come. It came formatted as FATex, but I switched to NTFS for my setup. I am going to use this as my Acronis Secure Zone backup space, so I don;t eat up any space on my primary SSD. Since the backups run at night, I won&rsquo;t need the 200+ MB writes of the main SSD. I am very happy, and I would buy another if this one ever went bad. But if it goes bad, I will always have the lifetime RMA, so &hellip;One other important thing to note: The Lenovo Y510P SD card reader is on the USB3 bus, I knew this because I tested the card in a Dell Latitude that only came with USB2, and the same card on the USB2 reader bus clocked in around 21Mb/S reads and writes, thus being capped by USB2. So, if you want to get the most out of this card, make sure your reader can support USB3 speeds. It might even read faster than 90Mb/s, but I will not know since I don&rsquo;t have a SD card reader on a PCI-E bus? I guess I could buy a PCI-E to SD card adapter for my Desktop, but I don&rsquo;t need it right now so I won&rsquo;t know anytime soon&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-performer">Good Performer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great in my economy class camcorder. No stutter when filming 1080p video. Copies multiple files ~ 20-50mb/s over the slow built in USB 2.0 interface (picture attached), and quite a bit faster than that when using USB 3.0 card reader. Worlds faster than my previous card which was an old 16gb class 4 from ~2010.The bubble pack/laminated card packing is a bit of a pain to open. Had to use scissors. Though, it&rsquo;s good that it&rsquo;s there, stops people from counterfeiting these cards, which unfortunately happens far too often.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-about-15-pcs-of-these-bad-boys-i-ordered-them-when-these-512gb-cards">I have about 15 pcs of these bad boys. I ordered them when these 512GB cards &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have about 15 pcs of these bad boys. I ordered them when these 512GB cards came out 2 years ago at around 400-450USD. Now the price is very reasonable, I place it in all my laptops / ultrabooks &ndash; so that I get an extra 512GB (actually 476GB usable) of extra space. In an age of ever shrinking laptops, with just one m2 512GB SSD, this card is a godsend.Couldnt be more happier.And I can verify that indeed the write speeds can approach 90 mbps. But on average, it hits about 55 mbps only.Still a great inexpensive way to expand storage of all my laptops.</p>

<h5 id="was-skeptical-about-pny-at-first-but-this-card-blew-me-away">Was skeptical about PNY at first, but this card blew me away.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got the 256GB version of this card to use with my Canon C100. This card is an absolute beast. So much storage on one card, it&rsquo;s insane. I can get about 23 hours of 1080p footage from my C100 after a format. Read and write speeds are pretty fast as well. Not much to really write about this card as it&rsquo;s just a simple SD card. Compared to Sandisk&rsquo;s U3 cards, PNY offers similar performance for half the cost. If you&rsquo;re skeptical about PNY cards and are deciding PNY or Sandisk, I would say go for PNY. So far performance and reliability has been very good.</p>
