<h5 id="this-stand-is-good-for-holding-the-extra-monitors-for-all-your-multi-tasking">This stand is good for holding the extra monitors for all your multi-tasking &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Between all the different things i do, having monitors on a single stand is a real benefit.I do everything from coding, streaming, photo/video editing and tech support.This stand is good for holding the extra monitors for all your multi-tasking needs.height, direction all the goodies you&rsquo;d want in a monitor stand.I think the thing i like most about this, is that you vice grip it to a desk. so should you want to move it around, its a quick twist, slide/move, twist and you&rsquo;re back to getting to work.If later down the road you add more or a ultrawide and put these above it. there is the option of using a longer bar by modifying it yourself. So that&rsquo;s a huge plus for me.</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-tv-stand">Sturdy tv stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Sturdy tv stand, very easy to assembly. The steel stand and the tempered glass base are heavy enough, very stable. I like the swivel and height adjustment functions. The pole is retractable and it has four height adjustments as there are 5 sets of holes at the back. To change the height, you just need to remove four screws into next sets of holes. All the adjustment are very smooth. The user manual is very clear and I only used 10 minutes to put all parts together. Very pleased with the purchase and has recommended it to my friends.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-swivel-tv-stand">Wonderful Swivel TV Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a wonderful product well worth the cost. It was easy to put together. All the parts were manufactured well and everything fit without any problem. The diagram is very clear and the parts are individually packaged for easier use. It is strong and well made. If I change my tv I can use it on another tv. All the tools needed to put it together are included in the package. Also, included are different screw sets to fit other tvs. I am very happy I chose this product. It swivels well as stated in the description. Only issue, when turning the tv, as it sits on a bar on the swivel, the tv moves. So, I turn the swivel by the brace on the back of tv set and not the tv. The glass bottom is tempered glass and very attractive. I highly recommend this product.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-solution-if-you-have-an-av-stand-that-is-to-short-and-don-t-want-to-put-holes-in-the-wall-with-a-regular-tv-mount">Excellent solution if you have an AV stand that is to short and don&rsquo;t want to put holes in the wall with a regular tv mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great tv stand for raising up your TV for better viewing. I didn&rsquo;t want to put holes in my bedroom wall, and my AV stand was regular height which is to short for a 42&rdquo; TV at the foot of my bed. This was the perfect solution for both of those problems. Easily assembled in 5 to 10 minutes with 3 sets of 4 screws each. Included with all the necessary screws are the tools as well. looks great and allows enough space for the center speaker under the TV. Recommend highly for the price point and quality.</p>

<h5 id="universal-swivel-tv-stand-was-a-smart-which-for-my-family-we-us-moving-every-few">Universal Swivel TV Stand was a smart which for my family we us moving every few &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Universal Swivel TV Stand was a smart which for my family we us moving every few years for my job the base was damaged and I was worried I would have to anchor it to the wall like last time which cost me to pay for them to fix. With the tv stand I now have a strong stand with a great looking base that ensures no one knows it wasn’t the original one. Our may Tv is 60 in and it fix perfectly. With the swivel feature means I can turn the tv to watch while we are eating dinner.</p>

<h5 id="great-stand">Great stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We threw away our original stands that came with the t.v.&rsquo;s because they were wall mounted. We decided to change some things around and took some of the t.v.&rsquo;s down. The hardest part was finding a decent stand to hold a fairly new Samsung 60&rdquo;. I cam across this stand and decided to give it a try. Assembly is easy and straight forward. With yhe t.v. mounted it feels stableand pretty solid. If you are looking for a stand for bigger t.v.&rsquo;s I would suggest looking at this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tv-stand">Great TV Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great heavy duty well made stand especially for older heavier TV&rsquo;s.I really liked the packaging of the attaching hardware, which is in lettered individual pouches, if you follow the instructions there is no way you can use the wrong bolt or screw, which is important for the ones that go into the back of the TV where length is critical.I used this stand on an older 42&rdquo; Sharp TV and it took about 15 minutes to assemble and the TV was very stable after assembly.</p>

<p>I needed a replacement stand for a 40&rdquo; sony. This stand is awesome! It is relatively easy to put together and it includes all the tools you need. Wasn&rsquo;t too difficult and didn&rsquo;t take much time. It went together well and supports our television securely. The swivel feature is really nice and works smoothly. I am using the middle setting. It looks great . looking at the TV at eye level is so much better. We are happy with this purchase!</p>
