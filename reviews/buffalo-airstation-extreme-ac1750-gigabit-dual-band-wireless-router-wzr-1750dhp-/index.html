<h5 id="best-bang-for-the-buck">Best Bang For The Buck.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>AirStation AC1750, Excellent Router. Does everything the more expensive routers claim they can do. This is way more router than most people need, including me. But at this price I couldn&rsquo;t resist future-proofing my system.It will practically set itself up for you. You can do a lot of tweaking if you want, but most people won&rsquo;t need to. Simple directions, easy to follow.I replaced a Netgear N300, which will do everything I need, but I was looking to extend my WiFi range. This Buffalo added about 20 to 25 yards to the distance I can go and still use my WiFi-only phone. My Netgear lost signal out about 50 yards, now I get over 70yards and can still make a call, using Google voice and hangouts.Thinking about getting a second one to make a repeater so I can use my laptop in my garage. That&rsquo;s 25+ yards away but the signal has to go through a few walls.Customer support is great too. I sent E-Mails back and forth with them to figure out the best way to set up what I need. Very friendly, helpful, and fast response.Highly recommend this router, or the WXR-1900 DHP. Both are priced way below the competition. And they are just as capable. Unless all you are interested in doing is playing &ldquo;Benchmark Wars&rdquo;, then spend as much money as you can.P.S. Stay away from the models that have in the model number; DD-WRT. Nothing wrong with them, but they are for extreme tweakers.</p>

<h5 id="sadly-my-linksys-54g-cannot-handle-the-higher-speeds-that">Sadly my Linksys 54G cannot handle the higher speeds that &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly my Linksys 54G cannot handle the higher speeds that my internet now offers (100mbit fiber connection) and I had to upgrade. I tried some other similar products first, even ones that you could root and install dd-wrt, but those inevitably had stability issues and had to be rebooted multiple times with or without dd-wrt.Now steps in Buffalo, this has run solidly for 6 months without a reboot needed.Update:Now into 9 months of ownership I wanted to add a USB drive for media storage. One issue the Buffalo AirStation has is it cannot mount NTFS partitions, the standard for Windows since the days of XP. The choice is FAT32 for up to 32Gb, then XFS (a linux file system) for drives larger than 32Gb.My solution was to switch from the Buffalo AirStation firmware to DD-WRT instead, Buffalo informed me that doing this would void the warranty on the device, but since it has ran solid for 8 months I&rsquo;m not worried. So far two weeks and no trouble, works great with my NTFS partition. The DD-WRT interface can be a little intimidating to people who aren&rsquo;t used to setting up networking equipment, but if you are coming from a Linksys 54G with DD-WRT you should feel right at home.Another feature that appears to be missing on the Buffalo firmware is SSH access to the device, this greatly decreases it&rsquo;s usefulness for those that like to tinker and roll our own solutions. Again with DD-WRT firmware loaded you now have SSH access to the device.With both these features you can then create custom scripts to run upon plugging in a device, e.g. starting up Transmission BitTorrent when the device gets mounted, and making sure it mounts to the correct partition, have it read the torrent directory, and start up. Useful if you don&rsquo;t want to run your external drive all the time but want it for the occasional new linux distribution release.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have AT&amp;T unverse (2wire) internet. The manual for THIS BUFFALO ROUTER actually has recommended configuration information for 2wire routers! Once I found the client mode setting on the 2wire device that lets this thing connect directly to the internet by plugging in the WAN port of the Buffalo to one of the LAN ports of the 2wire router, WOW! I am accustomed to netgear, belkin, linksys, etc. routers with limited features and slow; clunky interfaces. This is waaay better. I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about this buffalo WZR-1750DHP! I&rsquo;ve only had it a month now so the only question I have is will it stand the test of time. I haven&rsquo;t found anything this router won&rsquo;t do! I have Belkin WEMO (notoriously finicky about connecting to wireless routers) home automation connected to it on the 2.4GHz 20/40M SSID and all my computers/laptops/phones connected to the 5GHz 1300Mbps SSID. I use the built in PPTP VPN from work. Even my phone VPNs home so everything works just like i&rsquo;m there. (I get my mapped network drives from my QNAP NAS.) Every time I configure a new feature I am surprised because it is both easier to configure and more robust than any other consumer wireless router I have ever used! Most of this is of course owes to leveraging customized DD-WRT firmware but I am not a DD-WRT fan boy. I have experience with non-stock DD-WRT (this is the first ever wireless router with stock DD-WRT) on several other routers and the problems I ran into were stability, reliability, and speed. Not only it this the most stable DD-WRT router I have ever used, it is as stable running DD-WRT (and has more consumer desired features) as commercial cisco devices running IOS at many times the price! I am buying another one just for when I am away from home. The build quality and thought that went into this is absolutely perfect. The documentation which can be downloaded online or from the device is second to none (well maybe not as full as Cisco&rsquo;s, but way better than any other consumer grade). Not only is there always a context specific help menu available on every configuration page, but the manual completely lists all settings with explanations and additional, pictographical configuration procedures for every main configuration task appended to the end of the manual! Fantastic! But I can&rsquo;t say only good things. I have to find something bad about it. The worst thing about it&hellip; When you first look at it, it isn&rsquo;t obvious what the buttons do. I.E. There is a mode button and a mode switch, there is also an AOSS button that is used for both WPS and AOSS. Once you read the well written explanation all becomes clear. (The mode SWITCH is to change it from a router/access point to wireless bridge; and the mode BUTTON is to switch from router to access point mode.) I can see how someone wanting an out of box plug and play experience might accidentally switch the mode and then NOT read the manual, maybe&hellip; When you take it out of the box you can&rsquo;t help but notice the durable, removable waterproof information card that has all of the required reference information I.E. default IP, mac, ssid, key, etc&hellip; I&rsquo;m having a really hard time finding anything bad to say other than, this may be more device than some people might want.Oh yeah! In addition to auto/manual naming you can assign one of 8 icons to devices on your network to help you identify them quickly I.E. laptop, tower, portable device, printer, etc. I didn&rsquo;t find in the documentation what the pictures are supposed to be, and I couldn&rsquo;t find how to add new custom icons. For example I have a 3d printer on my network that doesn&rsquo;t look anything like any of the icons. So there! I found something for you to improve. Take that Buffalo!</p>
