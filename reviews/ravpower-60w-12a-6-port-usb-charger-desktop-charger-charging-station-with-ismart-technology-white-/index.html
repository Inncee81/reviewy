<h5 id="buy-this-one-i-checked-it-out-really-well-you-won-t-be-disappointed">Buy this one. I checked it out really well. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First, BEWARE of other units specifying high currents for their multiple ports only to find out that they can&rsquo;t deliver high power (current) on ALL of them at once. Also, bottom price adapters can output too high of a voltage and damage or ruin your stuff. There&rsquo;s a lot of junk being sold, so do your homework.Well, I did it for you. See below.We just returned from 2 weeks in Europe and used this charger every night.Each night, it charged 3 phones, a tablet and GPS, all at the same time.There, it worked on 240V. So, I used a cheap outlet adapter (Ceptics USA to Europe Asia Plug Adapter) to feed European 240V into my RAVPower supply. The unit automatically switches from 240V to 120V. With these inexpensive adapters, I can use my charger both at home and abroad.To keep an eye on things, I used a BESTOPE Dual-USB Output Charging Detector to monitor how well each of the USB outputs was performing (voltage and current under light and heavy loads). Obviously, you don&rsquo;t need to do this.My Charger worked perfectly.I found that it works equally well on the 120V here at home.I have no affliiation with this or any other USB power supply company. I am just an electrical engineer and am picky about delivering reliable, safe power for my expensive electronics.Dr. Dan</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m the type of person who reads the negative reviews first. And so it was before I placed my order for this charger. The common thread of the negative reviews was that shortly after purchasing it some of the charger slots would stop working. The range was anywhere from the first day to a month later. I was going to hold off writing a review until I&rsquo;ve had it for a while. Although I&rsquo;ve only had it for two weeks this charger has performed flawlessly, and tonight after it simultaneously charged two iPad Air 2&rsquo;s, an iPhone 6 and one of Ravpowers 16000mAh backup batteries in under 1.5 hours I felt it deserved to be reviewed. No, all four devices were not fully discharged. One iPad was at 16%, the other at 45, my iPhone was down to about 10%, and the backup battery was at about 65%. I do use this charger quite a bit on a daily basis, and have been alternating between the charging slots just to see how they each perform, and they&rsquo;ve all worked as expected. But tonight was the first time I hooked up multiple devices and was very impressed with the speed at which it charged them all. At most I would say the charger got warm, but that was all. Definitely not anywhere close to being hot as one reviewer said. Another said that the charger would make a loud humming sound. I haven&rsquo;t heard it make any noise. If it continues to perform as it has I will be very pleased indeed. Should anything change I will update this review.Update: it&rsquo;s been a few weeks with this charger and it is performing flawlessly. I put this thing through its paces daily charging no less then 3 and most of the time 5 items at once almost every night. The picture shows a typical days workload for my charger. All the ports work perfectly and it charges everything rapidly. I&rsquo;ve since ordered a second one for my wife, and upon doing so discovered the price had dropped to $12.99 from $15.99. A great charger at a great price with free shipping. Doesn&rsquo;t get better than that.Update II Well after a year and a half it has started to fail. A few days ago one of the ports stopped working and tonight a second one also failed. To be fair lt has charged 3 sometimes 4 devices on on an almost daily bases since I received it a year and a half ago so I guess that&rsquo;s not bad for 20 dollars.</p>

<h5 id="you-really-should-read-reviews-trust-me">You really should read reviews trust me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally I have a good multi-port charger. I have purchased two other chargers like this and neither one of them operated as stated. I honestly do read a lot reviews before I make most of my purchases. This time though I purchased the two bad ones from somewhere other than Amazon (sorry Amazon I didn&rsquo;t mean too, lesson learned)Once back to Amazon and reading reviews it was obvious that this one must be a good one. With over 3000 reviews written its really not a hard decision to make. There are cheaper one out there as well as more expensive. I think this one falls into a good price point between those. You do pay for what you get.This little product works great. I have two Ipads as does my wife, two Iphones 6s and 6s plus, new Fire HD8, Multiple Bluetooth headphones and probably quite a few more that I am leaving out and they all charge great. I consistently seem to have something plugged in and charging and as of yet I have had not one issue. I&rsquo;ve not had any overheating even with all 6 ports plugged and charging. The supplied plug that I have is four feet long which I really like. I know some have reported noise problems, I have had no noise problems as of yet even with all ports plugged in.I do appreciate the top review as it was thorough and helped me make my decision as did many other reviews.Bottom line for me. It does what it says it will do. Its well worth the price. If you are looking for a product like this I would say look no more.</p>
