<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for cheap active ear pro there are myriad options available from $15 to over $1,000. There is a reason these Howard Leight Impact Sport muffs are probably the most popular model of their type on the market &ndash; they&rsquo;re dirt cheap and work very well. They&rsquo;re built well for a $40 product, and battery replacement &ndash; the 3M Peltor&rsquo;s Achilles&rsquo; Heel &ndash; is sublimely simple, quick, and intuitive. That, and standard alkaline batteries seemingly last forever! They feel much more well built, and fit and feel MUCH nicer than the $50 Peltors they compete with. I have had three sets of Peltors as well (and have ComTac III and IV&rsquo;s too), and these Leights are a far superior alternative to the 3M&rsquo;s. If you&rsquo;re considering both units, there&rsquo;s your answer &ndash; get the Leights. Period.We have our own private rifle and handgun range on our property, so we&rsquo;re always shooting. We also attend a number of carbine and pistol classes each year, where some of them are VERY hard on gear, but these muffs have taken a beating and keep on going &ndash; even in a downpour! We&rsquo;re also big into the night vision world, so I was pleasantly surprised when the Team Wendy ComTac headset adapters worked with these muffs almost PERFECTLY (see photos I&rsquo;ve attached to this review). No need to be wed to Peltor if you need to run ear pro on your helmet(s)!Noise reduction is about the same as the Peltor units, but ambient sound amplification with the Leights is MUCH better. Where it was difficult to hear subtle sounds with the Peltors, the Leights give you Superman-like hearing! Yet another plus in the Leight column.They Howard Leights &ndash; in our extensive experience &ndash; are: MORE durable, MORE comfortable, have MUCH better battery installation, LOOK better, FEEL like they&rsquo;re higher quality, PERFORM better, and now that we&rsquo;ve discovered they can use the Peltor helmet mount adapters, there is simply NO reason to ever get another set of the cheap Peltors.Oh yeah, I almost forgot, they&rsquo;re 20% CHEAPER to boot! Can it get any better? I don&rsquo;t see how.</p>

<h5 id="an-important-omission">An Important Omission</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been mentioned in one or two other reviews but I would like to emphasize that this earmuff is for outdoor shooting ranges or other unenclosed areas. After testing at both indoor and outdoor ranges it was obvious to me - and my ears - that the sound coming through the earmuff at my indoor range was far too loud to be comfortable especially if someone else is shooting large calibers and/or magnum loads . It works fine at outdoor ranges however,If you shoot mostly or exclusively at indoor ranges I would recommend the &ldquo;Howard Leight R-01902 Impact Pro&rdquo; earmuffs. They lower the sound of indoor shots down to an acceptable level.I gave the earmuffs three stars because they work very well outdoors. I just wish they would have explained the problem with indoor ranges.</p>

<h5 id="not-good-for-indoor-ranges-ok-for-outdoor">Not good for indoor ranges. Ok for outdoor.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well this is my second review because apperantly the first wasn&rsquo;t within guidelines. They want a review strictly on the product, I can understand that as the shipping issue is on Amazon. With that said, the Impact Sports are not good for indoor ranges with people shooting anything over 9mm. Great for outdoor. The quality is awesome and They do work as far as adjusting what you can hear (people talking). If someone is shooting .40 cal and up then forget about it. I had to use ear plugs on top of these. I&rsquo;m obviously not the only other person shooting indoor who agrees with this statement, just read through other reviews. *UPDATES 9/10/16, just got back from the indoor range and now having compared, I strongly recommend the Pros for indoor with any size ammo. Pros blew the Impact Sport out of the water as far as dampening the sound indoor, had a duty shooting a Desert next to me and it wasn&rsquo;t bad at all. I turned them up and heard everyone talking around me. Funny to hear other people yelling because they where using non electric ears haha. My review is based off a set of Impact Pros I was forced to purchase elsewhere since mine never showed from Amazon. I changed my rating from one star to three because they are great quality and they are great for outdoor use with rifles as the slim designs helps a lot. I&rsquo;ll be keeping the pair I bought elsewhere for outdoor ranges and my Pros for indoor. If you are going to an indoor range and only 9mm and below is going to be used them they&rsquo;ll work fine.</p>

<h5 id="great-protection">great protection!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only con I see is the crazy wide differential between price for different &ldquo;colors.&ldquo;I thought my other &ldquo;over the ear&rdquo; type protection were awesome, but for about 20 dollars more, these are way more awesomer.I can actually hear what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s a strange feeling to know that you can hear the low talking, and then barely hear a gunshot..but it&rsquo;s a cool, strange feeling.When I plug in headphones, I can hear them fine, but I can no longer hear outside noise. i don&rsquo;t know if this is discussed (and it&rsquo;s not a big issue for me).. but it&rsquo;s a thing.I got a pair of teal for my girlfriend that were 8 dollars more (44) than my hunter green pair (36).. The black set is for the &ldquo;1 percent&rdquo; at 80 ish dollars.. seems ridiculous for a different color.</p>
