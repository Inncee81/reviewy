<h5 id="nice-simple-to-use-wide-angle-dash-cam">NIce simple to use wide angle dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I had been contemplating buying a dash cam for awhile and after reading reviews and watching youtube reviews decided to try the Aukey brand and it has proven to be a good choice. I&rsquo;ve never had a dash cam before but it was simple to set up and use. The camera holds up to 128 GB micro SD card which you will have to purchase separately. I&rsquo;m using a 32 Gb micro sd card and it is recording in 3 minute segments. The camera is easily connected to the windshield mount and comes with a long 15 FT cable. When the cable is connected to the USB dual port charger and is plugged into your car&rsquo;s power source the camera automatically comes on and starts recording. The recordings are very clear at day time and night use. The Aukey DR-10 is a very nice and simple to use wide angle dash cam. I have uploaded some videos to youtube to show some of the day and night recordings.</p>

<h5 id="image-quality-is-pretty-good-and-while-it-doesn-t-have-night-vision">Image quality is pretty good, and while it doesn&rsquo;t have night vision</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Image quality is pretty good, and while it doesn&rsquo;t have night vision, the shots taken at night are nice and clear. (Tip: make sure the inside of your windshield is clean.) Haven&rsquo;t tried the audio.There are only three cable clips included&ndash;this just isn&rsquo;t enough; five would be better. The instructions are&hellip;minimal.The suction cup used to hold the unit to the glass is really mediocre; it tends to fall off a lot. This makes the unit less than useful for recording purposes.Finally, make sure you don&rsquo;t leave the power source plugged in. My unit has a tendency to turn itself on, and then I get eight hours of the back of the house.UPDATE: I have to say that Aukey&rsquo;s tech support department is outstanding. Without any prompting from me, they contacted me and addressed several of the concerns that I had, to our mutual satisfaction. Kudos to them.</p>

<h5 id="solid-dash-cam-amazing-vendor-support-firmware-has-teething-issues">Solid dash cam, amazing vendor support, firmware has teething issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this shortly after they hit the market and is my 3rd dash cam in 2 years. Recording at 1080p gives a pretty clear picture and am able to read license plates of cars I&rsquo;m behind as well as cars coming at me if I pause the video (which is in .mov format). At night, very little pixelation and again the video is pretty good. The video at day and night is on par with more expensive cameras. The ability to add GPS later is great but not a necessity.I have GPS working with mine. Per Aukey customer support, the link below works with the DR-01 and I can personally confirm it works and locks on to GPS very quickly. Speed and location are spot on (but despite setting mph in the menu, STILL shows km/h). Unplug your dash cam, plug in the GPS in the correct port (the other is for AV) and plug it back in. If it&rsquo;s plugged in and working you will see a green G in the upper right corner after it locks in (takes 30 seconds or less). You will not see anything on your display while driving but when you watch the .mov file, it will have GPS coordinates and your speed in km/h. I can also confirm that Dash Cam software Registrator Viewer works great. You owe it to yourself to download a copy (it&rsquo;s free) to view your dash cam footage. Works without GPS but works much better with.PAPAGO! GPSA-US Dashcam GPS Antenna work with GoSafe 118/GoSafe 200/GoSafe 260/ GoSafe 381 DashcamI am happy with the dash cam <em>AND</em> Aukey&rsquo;s support and would recommend this but am currently looking for something better and more reliable. I had an issue with my first two units and was contacted by Aukey and sent replacements right away, hassle free. The latest one arrived, I installed the latest firmware (found on their website) but still have menu issues. Despite a firmware update JUST to fix the mph issue (when you select mph it still displays km/h on the video) it&rsquo;s still not resolved. It seemed to work correctly when I first updated the firmware but since then, it&rsquo;s reverted back to km/h even though the settings menu says it&rsquo;s set to mph. Doesn&rsquo;t affect the dash cam video and if you don&rsquo;t have the GPS antenna connected it is a non-issue. But there have been several menu settings that despite setting them, don&rsquo;t actually get selected.In case anyone is curious, 128GB class 10 cards work fine but make sure you use a microSD card that is rated specifically for dash cams. Make sure it says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;High Endurance&rdquo;.</p>

<h5 id="good-affordable-dash-camera">Good Affordable Dash Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I have been running the Dash Cam for about 2 weeks and so far have no real complaints.I am a little disappointed that even at 1080p in order to be able to read license plates I have to be as close to the car in front of me as it would be for my own eyes to read them, but that is likely of any dash camera.I have a 32gb Sandisk Class 10 micro-sd card that I am using and get between 6-7 hours of recording without audio at 1080p.Firmware:My camera came with an older version of the firmware. The Aukey website is not very clear about how to update the firmware. However when I contacted customer support they were able to tell me the latest firmware version (so I could see if mine was old) and provided me with the newest version to install with instructions on how to install it using the micro-sd card (they call it TF).Old Aukey Firmware: DR01_H.V1.0.1213New Aukey Firmware: DR01_H.V1.3.0221I did not have any issues I was aware of with the old version, but I am glad to be running the newest version now with hopes that any issues other users reported are now fixed. I also never had an issue with the camera not starting with the car either.Only con I have is the same as reported by Dash Cam reviewer on Youtube, which is the mount is not easily rotated if you wanted to quickly change where it was facing during an accident or something.Overall I am happy with this affordable little dash cam, and will update my review as time goes on for those curious.</p>
