<ul>
<li>For those who have given up playing the guitar due to finger pain</li>
<li>Eliminates painful callouses and string buzzing</li>
<li>Fits full sized acoustic guitar with string length of 25.5&rdquo;, left handed OK NOTE: Does not fit Classical Guitar</li>
<li>Over 110 chords, full scales of &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; available</li>

<li><p>Simple rugged design, easy to install</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The Ez-Fret is designed for those who have made a strong effort to fret the strings with their fingers, but who have given up due to finger pain and frustration with string buzzing. Using the 18 buttons which control the first three frets, over 110 chords, including the basic chords for the guitar keys of C, D, E, G and A, are available. Also, you have full scales of “C”and “F.” You will produce perfect and clear tones which are very difficult to achieve with ordinary fingering. Before trying the Ez-Fret, you should make every effort to play without it. Caution: Once you have tried the Ez-Fret, fretting the strings with your fingers will seem like a medieval torture. You will become addicted to the Ez-Fret. Instructions and basic chord fingering included.</p>

<h5 id="great-attachement-now-make-one-for-my-2-neck-guitar">Great Attachement&hellip;&hellip;now make one for my 2&rdquo; neck guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well designed product that does exactly what they claim&hellip;&hellip;.allow you to finger chords by pressing the buttons. The overall product is great and it works very well while being relatively easy to install.My only real comment towards improvement is that the fingering is not always great with the staggered buttons on each fret as sometimes you want the stagger different than the attachment has (like reversing the 3rd fret arrangement for easier C chord fingering). But, for the most part, this is great&hellip;&hellip;..and I do try to keep the same fingering on the chords as I do when I am not using this attachment.Note that this only fits my &lsquo;standard&rsquo; 1.75&rdquo; (measured at the neck) fret guitar and would love to buy one for my wider, 2&rdquo; neck guitar&hellip;..which I prefer as it has more space between the strings for wider fingers. I would buy one for this guitar in a minute if offered as I suspect other people buy wider neck guitars as they are easier to keep your fingers from affecting open strings. Having written this, my 1.75&rdquo; guitar is much easier to play with this attachment than without (as my fingers touch other strings and this attachment prevents that). But, I would like one for my wider neck guitar.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-beginners">Great for Beginners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my nephew after he abandoned the guitar several times, complaining of pain in his fingers.This is a terrific tool for beginners. It allows users to produce music the very first time you pick up the guitar, instead of hours and hours of frustrating and painful trials.The best part is that after a few weeks my nephew took it off and Ez-Fret had also taught him the correct position of his fingers on the strings. Ez-Fret is very well thought out and adapts to almost any acoustic guitar. Package arrives with a helpful and easy quick reference manual for installation and use. I highly recommend it!</p>

<h5 id="interesting-concept-that-is-really-cool-in-theory">Interesting concept that is really cool in theory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting concept that is really cool in theory. Product itself is cheap plastic that doesn&rsquo;t feel like it will last. The method of connecting the product to the guitar is not the best as the rubber bands aren&rsquo;t the best at holding the module in place. Pushing the buttons can result in the tool moving and not lining up properly on the strings. It also comes down to remembering fingering on this tool or actually learning the real chords. Didn&rsquo;t really work for me but I like the concept and look forward to updates to the product to resolve some minor issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found the Ez-Fret Guitar attachment kind of difficult to adjust and a little difficult to use at present. I will give it more time to get used to using it.</p>

<h5 id="i-was-making-beautiful-chords-with-one-week-s-practice-i-was-able">I was making beautiful chords. With one week&rsquo;s practice I was able &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My goal was just to be able to play a few chords to accompany some campfire singing, or my church&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s choir: I&rsquo;m not trying to become the next Hendrix. That said, I was having a lot of trouble even playing &ldquo;simple&rdquo; chords because I have very soft, wide fingers and I just couldn&rsquo;t get them to not mute the neighboring strings. This device did the trick. Within minutes of rubber-banding it on and adjusting the height screws (an important step), I was making beautiful chords. With one week&rsquo;s practice I was able to easily accompany a group of singing children with the four or five chords that I had learned. (And those sweet kids even said I was the best guitar player they had ever heard&ndash;lol! best possible beginning audience, am I right?!) As an learning-aid I put colored-coded stickers right on the button-surfaces that I needed for my chords. I haven&rsquo;t had any trouble with the ez-fret coming off or damaging the guitar, although it does slide and sometimes needs scooted back to position, and I did have to adjust the screws a couple of times. Some people complained that it made chords harder to reach, but I haven&rsquo;t had any problems, and I have the smallest hands of any adult woman I have ever met, though I do play the piano and cello, so I&rsquo;ve had some practice stretching my reach. I know, short hands, thick fingers&ndash;and I&rsquo;m not even overweight&ndash;how does that happen? Anyway, I highly recommend this for casual guitar playing. If you want to become the next Hendrix, you&rsquo;d probably better learn to do it the normal way, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting idea but not very practical. It helps you painlessness fretting across but when you hit the chords out of it&rsquo;s range, this will actually make your fretting harder.</p>
