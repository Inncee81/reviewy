<h5 id="these-worked-beautifully-you-can-see-in-the-provided-picture">these worked beautifully. You can see in the provided picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was at first skeptical, since my Samsung sound bar is complicated and doesn&rsquo;t contain mounting holes. After researching, the only way to mount my Samsung sound bar is with a Samsung wall mount, however I didn&rsquo;t want my bar mounted on the wall since my tv is on a swivel mount, so it needed to be attached to the TV. Researching online came up with nothing, so apparently what I done has never been done before?! (I find this odd) So I decided to be creative&hellip; Once installed, these worked beautifully. You can see in the provided picture, I used this set with the Samsung sound bar mount. I mounted the Mount it to the TV which then attached to the Samsung mount. It worked beautifully and couldn&rsquo;t be happier with the end result. Fits nice and flush under the TV.</p>

<h5 id="super-easy-and-secure">Super easy and secure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this to attached a 38&rdquo; soundbar to my 50&rdquo; TV. Really had some serious doubts at first but once it is on, it doesn&rsquo;t move at all. Really easy to connect, didn&rsquo;t have have to take the mount off the back of the TV. Remove one bolt, slide in soundbar mount, replace screw and repeat on the other side. It&rsquo;s that easy.</p>

<h5 id="a-sturdy-practical-mount-that-works-well-for-sonos-playbar">A sturdy, practical mount that works well for Sonos Playbar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this mount to attach a Sonos Playbar to a free-standing Panasonic 50&rdquo; TV. It worked out very well, and I&rsquo;m pleased with the result. The mount is secure, with no hint of wobble when the TV is moved (it is on a swivel base).Because I could not find specifications for the mounting holes on the Playbar before buying it, and because the product information for this mount did not include details on the included hardware, I was concerned that I might have to improvise, but happily that wasn&rsquo;t necessary. To save others from having to do the same fruitless search that I did, here are some details if you are considering using this mount with a Sonos Playbar and you want to know what the set-up will be like.You will need to put the TV down on its face in order to install the mount, and if the TV has a stand, you will find it easier if you remove the stand before starting to attach the mount.The accompanying picture is taken from the mount&rsquo;s instructions to show the hardware that comes with it. Attaching the mount to a 50&rdquo; (or larger) TV, requires the M8 bolts (either &ldquo;D&rdquo; or &ldquo;F&rdquo; in the picture). If the TV is on a stand rather than a wall mount, the shorter M8 bolts (&ldquo;D&rdquo;) are adequate. The first step is to attach the two mounting arms to the upper mounting holes on the back of the TV. It&rsquo;s important to use a D8 washer (&ldquo;H&rdquo; in the picture) with each mounting bolt as shown in the instruction diagrams. On TVs of this size, the holes have a standard separation of 400mm (about 16 inches), and since the Playbar&rsquo;s mounting holes are about 29&rdquo; apart, the curved ends of the mounting arms need to point away from each other.I positioned the arms so that the upper ends extended far enough above the TV to leave room for the Playbar (about 3.5&rdquo;) and were about 29 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; apart, then I tightened the two bolts on the back of the TV until they were snug but not quite tight.I found that attaching the Playbar to the arms is a little tricky. The mounting holes are two keyhole-type slots into which a bolt head slides, after which a nut is tightened to clamp the Playbar against the mounting arms. The instructions suggest using the &ldquo;L&rdquo; bolts, but I found the heads on them to be too small to &ldquo;catch&rdquo; in the keyhole, so I used the &ldquo;E&rdquo; bolts instead (&ldquo;C&rdquo; would probably have worked too) with the &ldquo;M&rdquo; nuts.The instructions seem to indicate that the TV should be in an upright position when attaching the Playbar, but I found it awkward to support the Playbar and simultaneously position the bolts in the slots (another pair of hands would have solved that problem). Instead, I left the TV lying face down while attaching the Playbar. It requires a little care and patience to ensure that the bolt heads stay correctly positioned and &ldquo;grab&rdquo; the keyholes while tightening the nuts (which incidentally are 10mm metric). As with the first set of bolts, I left these nuts with just a tiny bit of play, then I set the TV upright on its stand and did the final adjustments to center the Playbar before finally tightening the bolts and nuts the last little bit.I&rsquo;ve given this product a 5-star review because it ended up doing exactly what I wanted, though I would have liked to be more confident about that before buying it. Knowing in advance what mounting hardware was included would have helped. Perhaps the manufacturer will update the product information on Amazon to add this information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are very versatile and can adapt to almost any situation. Thin and strong, easy to install. The only complaint is the threaded posts that hold the speaker bar to the mount itself are not &ldquo;keyed or notched&rdquo;, therefore they tend to spin when tightening them up. Other than that the speaker bar stays in place, no sagging or slipping like the Sanus universal mounts I have used in the past. this is my new speaker bar bracket!I used these brackets with a Sonos Playbar, Samsung 65&rdquo; HDTV and Proconnect articulating wall mount. I was quite pleased with the results!</p>

<h5 id="works-well-for-vizip-s4221w-c4-soundbar-mounted-on-65-inch-sony-tv">Works well for Vizip S4221w-c4 Soundbar mounted on 65 inch Sony TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These worked great for mounting my Vizio S4221w-c4 soundbar to my 65 inch Sony TV. At first I had my soundbar in front of my TV on the entertainment center but I got tired of it blocking the remote signal and a little bit of the screen. Now the soundbar is out of the way and the sound is actually better coming from it being mounted on top of the TV. I was a little concerned The mounts would be visible and look bad but once I finished setting it up now I think it looks really good as opposed to being in the way. This was a low cost fix for my problem finding a place to put my soundbar and I wish I would have bought it sooner.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-sound-bar-mounts">Fantastic sound bar mounts!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are a brilliantly designed product. Using these on a 65 inch vizio with a 48 inch vizio sound bar. Product is easy to mount adjustment takes a few minutes to get perfect but is absolutely worth it. I have already ordered 2 sets of these because they work so well. Also have had others by after seeing mine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried several other types of these mounts to try to mount my Vizio curved soundbar to my 65&rdquo; SUHD Curved t.v. &amp; all have failed miserably leaving me hopeless and disappointed.I actually passed over this one several times, thinking this is way to simple of a design to work on my t.v. But after reading the reviews o decided to give it a shot. I&rsquo;m glad I did because it worked like a charm!It was so amazing how versatile this design is for adjusting it to whatever size or angle it needs to be at to connect right where I needed it to be. Just see for yourself in my pics below.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-fit-for-our-50-vizio-tv-sound-bar">Perfect fit for our 50&rdquo; Vizio TV &amp; Sound bar.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These worked out well to attach the sound bar below our 50&rdquo; Vizio LCD TV. Brackets are rigid enough to locate &amp; support the sound bar, and the shape gave us enough flexibility to pick up the attach points on the TV VESA pattern &amp; on the sound bar. I left a 1&rdquo; gap between them to accommodate the Wii motion sensor along the top of the sound bar. Clear instructions, and the included hardware was just what was needed.</p>
