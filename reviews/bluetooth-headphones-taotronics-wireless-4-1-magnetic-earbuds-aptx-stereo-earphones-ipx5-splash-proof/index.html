<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="whole-heartedly-recommended-by-my-wife">Whole-heartedly recommended by my wife</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife loves these earbuds because they not only sound good and do a great job of blocking outside noise, but they&rsquo;re also magnetic and hook together to form a necklace so that she doesn&rsquo;t lose them. Plus, she likes that the rubber hook things which are supposed to help hold them in your ear can be removed, because she doesn&rsquo;t like those things and they stay in fine without them.These come with three different sizes of rubber earbud and hook attachments so you&rsquo;re bound to find one that fits your ears. There is also a little carry pouch which she hasn&rsquo;t used and a micro-USB charging cable which is very short, like only a few inches long. She hasn&rsquo;t used that either as her phone uses a micro-USB cable so she just uses that one. The box it comes in is also pretty nice. It&rsquo;s standard cardboard tan color, but has silver reflective lettering for the WIRELESS STEREO HEADPHONES text, rounded corners, and easy-to-open clam-shell design.She took these earbuds with her on our recent trip to L.A. and she loved them as they were crisp and clear and blocked out the sound of the car and the talking that my friend and I were doing in the front seat. Today she used them at work and loved them there as well, so she whole-heartedly recommends them.</p>

<h5 id="the-best">the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, let me start by saying their customer service is really note worthy. I had an issue with the first pair I purchased, and they went above and beyond to resolve the issue.As far as the headphones go, they&rsquo;re easily the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever used.They style and build of this is comfortable and practical. I have small ear holes (who knew that was a thing), most headphones fit uncomfortably, but these come with 3 different sizes which was really nice. I also love the fact that they&rsquo;re magnets and I can wear them around my neck without worrying about losing them.As far as sound quality, these are one of the best out there. The sound is clear, crisp and it really does a good job with noise canceling. I can&rsquo;t even hear my boss yelling at me when I have these on.The only negative I can come up with is the mic isn&rsquo;t always that clear. It could be my hair getting in the way, or being too far from my mouth, but I do have people tell me it&rsquo;s difficult for them to hear me.Other than that, these are phenomenal headphones. I&rsquo;ve already bought 3 pairs, and recommended them to plenty of people.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-dre-beats">Better than Dre Beats!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the rubbery ear things (both the one that goes in your ear and that hook-like anchor thing) start falling off after a while and itâ€™s easy to lose them.Other than that, these earbuds produce super high quality sound. One time after using these for a few weeks I left these at home and used my dre beats instead and I was astonished at how much i was wishing I had these instead of the beats. I didnâ€™t realized how much better he sound could be. For the price, these are SO worth it!! Fix the rubbery thing such that it doesnâ€™t stretch and fall, and you have a gold mine.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-great">These are great!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love these! I wear these all the time. These are perfect for cooking in the kitchen when I&rsquo;m not able to play music out loud and while I&rsquo;m cleaning houses for a living. These really are great! My main issue with corded headphones is getting caught on things. These without a long cord never snag and rip out of my ear or phone. They fit around my neck nicely so when I work I can easily wear only the right ear bud and it is still comfortable for listening to music or answer calls. Only thing I dislike is they happen to come loose in my ears here and there when I&rsquo;m moving and bending around a lot. Overall, I love these and highly recommend them!</p>

<h5 id="starting-to-die-resurrection">Starting to Die &hellip; RESURRECTION</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>45 days in, I&rsquo;m beginning to have issues. While it still &ldquo;works&rdquo;, none of of the buttons are working properly. Too bad I&rsquo;m now 45 days out from delivery, so I can&rsquo;t get a refund. I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that lasts more than two months.UPDATE Nov. 15th: TaoTronics sent me a replacement unit, free of charge, and they responded very quickly. They&rsquo;re standing behind their product, which I appreciate. I use this device every day. My primary use is while running, but I also prefer to use a headset rather than holding a phone to my ear when talking. I think the running (perspiration, running in light rain) may have killed the first unit, but this replacement unit is going to be put to the same test. So far, so good with this replacement unit. A good, moderately-priced bluetooth headset is really hard to find. I&rsquo;ve been through dozens of them. Hopefully this one will be the solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="freedom">Freedom!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the freedom of the Bluetooth headphones! I am able to connect to my devices and still get up to grab papers from the printer or go to the bathroom and still be connected.using for the treadmill and itâ€™s not connected so I know my phone is safe and wonâ€™t fall. Great for the car, hands free talking. The ear buds come in different sizes so they fit anyone. Volume co trip on the headphones so you donâ€™t have to be near your device to pause or turn up or down. So handy!!</p>

<h5 id="the-sound-is-nice-but-i-ve-been-having-some-trouble-with-them">The sound is nice, but I&rsquo;ve been having some trouble with them &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These headphones are just okay to me. The sound is nice, but I&rsquo;ve been having some trouble with them cutting out even though I&rsquo;m a foot or two away from my computer. They&rsquo;re also not very comfortable, I do not like to wear them for long periods of time because my ears get sore. I often switch back to my skull candy earbuds. I actually took the rubber/gummy things from my skull candy ones and put them on these earbuds. Helped a little, but not a ton. I dunno. meh.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-headphones">Great headphones!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These little headphones are great! They arrived in a very concise, neat package. They came with a lot of accessories, different size ear pieces and a little carrying bag. They fit super comfortable in my ear, and they actually block out quite a bit of noise. Used them while making dinner and could barely hear the water running from think sink as well as a spoon clanking against glass. Very pleased with these headphones, and my husband kind of wants his own pair. Definitely a winner!</p>
