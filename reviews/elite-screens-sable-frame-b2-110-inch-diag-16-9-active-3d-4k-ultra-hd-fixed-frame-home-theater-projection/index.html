<h5 id="i-am-extremely-satisfied-with-this-screen">I am extremely satisfied with this screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this screen. I had a Silver Ticket Screen before this, but the screen material drove me crazy, it had a weird sparkle to it and when ever there was motion it became very evident that you were watching a projector. This screen has zero perceived texture. Once you project an image on it, the screen just disappears how one would expect a screen to. Gives you that feeling of a 110 inch LED TV. So glad I ditched my old screen for this.I am using a sony vpl-hw40es and the picture looks crisp and vivid. When using the Silver Ticket it added a muddy appearance to everything. It seemed to make everything look not as sharp, especially in whites and lighter scenes. This screen makes my $2000 projector seem like the projector all the reviewers were saying it is.I Actually have had many screens over the years. The first screen I made I followed projector centrals recommendation and used framed photo backdrop paper, I was not satisfied with the results so I replaced the paper with stretched black out cloth&hellip;. I really loved this screen. I moved and sold the screen with the house so I decided to buy a &ldquo;Real&rdquo; screen rather than build one. I first got the Silver Ticket and it was not near as good as even the black out fabric, so I was nervous this would be the same. The Elite Screen is the best of all the screens I have had&hellip; I installed it and it reminds me of the black out cloth but even better. So glad I decided to make the switchThe other issue I was afraid of was installation. Lots of reviewers on here seemed to have problems, but I thought it was so easy. I did the whole thing by my self in about 45 minutes and my wife helped me hang it in about 3. Maybe they changed something about this screen, but as of today it is a super easy to install screen.Bottom line, if you are looking for a &ldquo;Budget screen&rdquo; this is the one to get. Small price, amazing picture.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-see-how-you-could-get-a-better-projector-screen-anywhere-close-to-this-price-range">Don&rsquo;t see how you could get a better projector screen anywhere close to this price range.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is high quality and my projector picture looks awesome on it. Nothing too difficult about assembling. Frame assembly is a breeze, but as others have noted, sticking in all those little plastic clips takes a while and your fingers will be a bit sore when you&rsquo;re done. However, once all the clips are in place, the screen is stretched perfectly without a wrinkle or any kind of flaw on the screen. It truly looks perfect.I&rsquo;m using an Epson Home Cinema 1440 1080p 3LCD Home Theater Projector, which I also purchased on Amazon, and these two items paired up together make for a truly great home Cinema. A picture of the screen doesn&rsquo;t do the true picture displayed on this screen justice, but I have attached a picture just to give you an idea of how good it looks.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-screen">Excellent screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice screen, I am only giving it 4 stars because the brackets were stripped when i tried to put them together. The manufacture was very helpful and offered to send new connecting brackets. I was very happy for the price. I ended up buying the acoustically transparent version so I could put my speakers behind the screen; in my opinion, that was worth every second of my time!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-frame-is-sturdy-and-well-built">The frame is sturdy and well built</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The frame is sturdy and well built. There were no wrinkles or imperfections in the screen once assembled. The packaging was excellent. It was hard but not impossible to assemble alone, however the stretching of the screen while placing the clips was very taxing at times and I nearly gave up to wait for help. If you&rsquo;ve got really string fingers, you can kind of make a V with your fingers and pull the screen into the groove while placing the clip if it&rsquo;s not one that needs hammering. You&rsquo;re best off having a helper to assemble and to hang it. I used an old bedsheet on the floor, and it picked up some of the felt coating but I think it&rsquo;ll come off. The black velvet does a good job of catching overshoot (intentional or otherwise). All in all, for the money, this is a steal and a very large screen.</p>

<h5 id="great-screen-awesome-customer-service-from-amazon">Great screen, awesome customer service from Amazon.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is great!Projector: Epson 8350Room Environment: Small amount of ambient light leaking from edges of blackout curtains during the day to the left side of the screenNote: If I open the farthest back curtain, the picture is still pretty good.0. Be patient during assembly.1. Make sure if you get the CineWhite that the room is dark. Any light can wash the black levels.2. Use the buddy rule for assembly: Be very careful not to tear the vinyl while attaching the springs.3. Don&rsquo;t worry about the screen having wrinkled spots during spring assembly. These won&rsquo;t disappear until pretty much all the springs are on.4. If mounting in drywall, don&rsquo;t push with the screwdriver while screwing in, just turn the screwdriver and let the screw find its way in. (if you push you could lose the drywall anchor.)5. Don&rsquo;t worry if your holes aren&rsquo;t perfect for the mounts, there is plenty of play so that you can get the mounts level. (recommend a laser level)6. When hanging the screen, push down after you have it on the mount to seat it, otherwise it won&rsquo;t stay.I had one problem with my screen and that was on one of the borders. The felt stuff had been rubbed off during assembly or packaging in about a dime size space where the aluminum shines through. I contacted Amazon and was given a partial refund for the issue. I&rsquo;ll probably be putting black nail polish over the aluminum so it isn&rsquo;t noticeable. Another issue that I had was that it arrived on the third day after it shipped with prime 2 day shipping.The picture is what I really cared about, the picture looks way better than just showing it on the wall, a lot of that has to do with the material, but having a very dark border around the picture makes a big difference as well.</p>

<h5 id="excellant-screen-for-the-money">Excellant screen for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has become my standard screen for media room installs. Very easy to put together, although I HIGHLY recommend you use two people to assemble. We have gotten the process down to about 30 minutes for two people. The sheet rock anchors they provide are perfect for quickly mounting on the wall. We make use of a laser level to get it spot on. A long bar level can also do it for you, but can be cumbersome.</p>

<p>Excellent screen</p>

<h5 id="do-it">Do It</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s legit. The assembly was a bit tedious but I think I&rsquo;m just being a baby about it. Seriously it is a worthy investment. Also, bigger is better.</p>

<p>The screen is great, I have 0 complaints. Overall quality is very good and the picture is great. I would buy it again.</p>
