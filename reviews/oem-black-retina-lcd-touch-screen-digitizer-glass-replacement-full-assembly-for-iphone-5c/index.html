<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="will-buy-again">Will Buy Again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product was VERY WELL protected! It came in the standard yellow envelope that most packages this size come in, and inside that package was a plastic wrapped sealed, cardboard box. I was amazed by this and was even more amazed to open it up and find it being protected by some, what looks to be high quality black foam board. The only way this product could of been damaged on it&rsquo;s way to my house would of been for it to be set on fire! I was extremely satisfied with this products packaging.It comes with a screen protector that must be removed after application and the plastic protector on the back. This screen is very well built and gives the user a high quality display that looks very similar to the standard iPhone 5c screen.The only complaints I have about this screen is that there color from the LCD does not get as bright as the original iPhone LCD as it seems to have a little more blue noticeable and that there is a spec of dust between the glass and LCD that must of gotten stuck there when they replaced glued the two together <em>SEE PICTURES TO SEE WHAT I&rsquo;M TALKING ABOUT</em>. I just wish that they would have payed more attention to their product when they were testing this and noticed it before they sent it out to their customers.</p>

<h5 id="discoloration-issue-and-low-durability">Discoloration issue and low durability</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived pretty fast (on weekend) nicely packed with tools. Received separate email from the seller with a link to the how-to-install video and personalized customer care message to contact for any issues. That is where all the good things end. I have changed iPhone 5C screens 3 times prior to this. But I have been fed up with the quality of the screens in terms of durability and this one was no exception. It took me 20-30 minutes to change the screen. I had two big problems listed below:1. Worked pretty well after install, the feel of the screen on finger tip is nice. But there was discoloration on the top edge clearly visible and is distracting when looking at the screen. Definitely not a sign of good quality product.2. I wish the screen was a little more durable. As soon as I installed and removed the protective cover I noticed a small/faint crack on the top right. I did not look for it before the install but I suspect it may have happened during the last step of install while gently pressing the screen down to fit into the iPhone body. I have changed the 5C screens before and am gentle during the install, so I don&rsquo;t expect the screen to give way without careless use. This was one of the more expensive 5c screens that I had order but lasted the shortest.Update 1:Just 1 day of normal (read, protected) use I see another crack on the top left. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this to be a super reliable screen given my experience with previous screens but giving way after just one day is pretty shoddy workmanship/material.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended">Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent packaging, excellent kit! Successfully changed a broken screen.. Be sure to connect the three connectors 100% correctly as i did not do this the first time. Recommended. Easy buy - saved money and repaired phone :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked perfectly.Much more difficult than I had anticipated. But that was my fault, because I watched an instructional video on YouTube only as far as getting the screen separated from the case. From there I just removed the screws and the clip in wire connectors. All in all the product is great, the tools that came with it work fine, but expect many tiny screws that at times may be difficult to work with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mine-did-not-work-properly">Mine did not work properly.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>From the prior reviews, I knew this could be hit or miss. My screen was delivered and packaged well. I watched the YouTube videos, and installation went well. Screen worked but the left <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> of the screen would not function. I tried reinstalling and trouble shooting several times. The rest of the screen worked perfectly, just too frustrating to not have the left edge of the screen be visible or function. Returned the item. Tried a different brand with higher ratings (and a higher price) and it worked the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-replacement-you-are-looking-for">The replacement you are looking for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! If you&rsquo;re looking for a great replacement this is it. Doesn&rsquo;t perfectly match original, but you can&rsquo;t tell the difference unless you know it. If correctly installed you shouldn&rsquo;t get any pixel grids (check pin connection if you have a grid).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-poor-quality-display-use-at-your-own-risk">Really poor quality display. Use at your own risk!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Replacement screen for the iPhone 5c.This is a pretty easy replacement. You do have to reuse the home button but nbd. This screen comes will all tools needed. I didn&rsquo;t watch any videos or anything, I just popped the old screen open and it was pretty obvious what to do. There are three connectors between the screen and the phone. You have to take out 4 screws to take off the the connector&rsquo;s cover. There are two screws holding in the home button and a couple screws holding the LCD display to the digitizer. Get through these and you&rsquo;ve got it. The new screen worked perfectly, no off color or dead spots. I can&rsquo;t detect any picture quality difference.UPDATE!!! I originally had a 5 star review but now after one week of use with perfect screen quality, I suddenly I have all kinds of lines on the screen and the picture quality has seriously deteriorated. I can still use and see all spots of the screen, but it has the appearance of having really low resolution. Not sure what happened, but I would not buy again and do not recommend.</p>
