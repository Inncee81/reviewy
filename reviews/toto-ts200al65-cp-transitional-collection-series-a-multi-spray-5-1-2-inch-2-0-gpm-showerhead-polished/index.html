<h5 id="best-shower-head-in-the-history-of-shower-heads">Best shower head in the history of shower heads.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kinda expensive, but can&rsquo;t say enough good. Heavy, smooth action&ndash;no hint of plasticky cheapness. No faddish wiggle-waggles or glittery bumpy-skunk settings you use once and shiver away from after. With factory flow reducer, this head provides an amazing compromise of water-stinginess and acceptable wetting. I mean, that is what we shower for, right? Getting wet. There&rsquo;s a soft, wide-flow rain setting, a nice narrower massage, and a economy wrap-you-entirely-in-stinging-mist-while-using-four-drops-of-water setting. For full economy, you also get a quick navy-style pause. But here&rsquo;s my advice: get a pair of needle-nose pliers and remove the flow control. Then, spring for an adjustable flow-control like the KES Brass Shower Flow Control Valve, K1140B3, for under $10. Then you have the killer combo. Guilt-free, environmentally-responsible 2-5GpH* showers for every-day use, and on special occasions, flip the valve open a skosh and treat yourself to the full 7GpH* thumping massage, painful needly mist, or wet, wet, WET rain setting. Aaah&hellip; baby. Keep an eye open for refurb&rsquo;s to save another $10 or so.</p>

<h5 id="despite-the-easy-installation-i-was-not-initially-pleased-with-my-purchase">Despite the easy installation I was not initially pleased with my purchase &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Picked this showerhead thanks to the Sweethome. Despite the easy installation I was not initially pleased with my purchase on account of the low water pressure coming out of the faucet until I removed the water regulator. Since then it had been great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased two units to replace low flow Moen faucets. These actually have three selections, only two were mentioned, one shuts the faucet off separately from the main valve (a surprise) that might be helpful to some situations, another is the high flow setting and the last one is the high pressure pulsating setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-bad-pressure">Really bad pressure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of research on shower heads as I&rsquo;ve been trying to replace one that formed a crack. I started out with the Delta H2OKinetic, which by the way is REALLY good. And not just really good for $20, but it&rsquo;s by far one of the best shower heads I&rsquo;ve ever used. At 1.85 gpm, it had the most awesome water pressure and it was a wonderful shower. I actually looked forward to my shower every day. Unfortunately, my girlfriend told me that it was horrible for her and it was too much pressure - like &ldquo;bullets hitting my head&rdquo; she would say. Anyhow, this led me to this shower after reading all the different reviews online.This shower head sucks. I live in a fairly newly constructed house with good water pressure, and this shower head had absolutely no pressure. On the setting with all the jets open, the water couldn&rsquo;t even shoot out straight and just drooped coming out. I had to use the setting where the middle jets weren&rsquo;t on and then it gave an okay shower. It was very light pressure, but it was good coverage. The massage mode was more pressure, but not really that great (when compared to the pressure of the Delta), and the mist was cool, but also made the water rather cold. The water restrictor that came with it was slightly bent, maybe that was some of the issues with the pressure, but if you do the math at 2 gpm, and the number of nozzles and no special technology like the Moen&rsquo;s immersion, or Kohler&rsquo;s Katalyst, the pressure just can&rsquo;t be that great with this shower head.I ended up getting the Kohler Forte Katalyst 2gpm, and it is fantastic (will be writing that review next)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-lowflow-showerhead">Great Lowflow Showerhead</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace a water guzzling 3 gpm shower head on my shower panel. The design looks high end and pairs up well with the existing fixture. The increased width (5.5&rdquo; vs. the usual 4-4.5&rdquo;) gives it more of a rainfall showerhead feel like the one it was replacing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great pattern on the full spray. Feels wonderful even though it is low flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-good-looking-shower-head-and-the-settings-are-fun-to">This is a very good looking shower head and the settings are fun to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good looking shower head and the settings are fun to play with. But I received my shower head covered in water spots like it had been used before or it wasn&rsquo;t polished before it was shipped. That was my only disappointment with this item although all it took was a little buffing to get the water spots off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended">Highly recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pleased with this shower head. I did my on line reading research before buying this and it has been a very nice experience the way it gently disperses the water flow evenly. Would highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, nice range of spray patterns.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-shower-head">Good Shower head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good shower head. Easy to install</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-shower-head">Excellent shower head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent shower head. Easy to install and nice stream of water. Found it via a review website that gave it very high marks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-tremendous-water-pressure">Must have tremendous water pressure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I chose this shower head after reading a review from a website and it was described as a good shower head for low water pressure. It was terrible and had to replace.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-mold-shower-head">No mold shower head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Our previous shower head also saved water, but it was impossible to stop the mold. I&rsquo;m 100% happy with this head, and our water bill dropped a bit more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="feels-great-but-needs-a-tad-more-pressure">Feels great but needs a tad more pressure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Feels wonderful but could use a tad more pressure. Not as strong as the waterpik it replaced.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-shower-head">Great shower head!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This shower head works pretty great. I wish it had an it more power to it but it gets the job done! All the settings are good as well and I really like how it has a shut off&hellip;</p>
