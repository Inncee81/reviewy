The film weaves together spectacular aerial cinematography, breathtaking vistas of the west, archival photographs and maps and the potent energy and rhythms of a live steam locomotive to immerse audiences in an era of remarkable ingenuity and struggle and through a region of stunning natural beauty. Ride the rails along deep river canyons and over high mountain passes. Discover some of the most beautiful and rugged landscapes on earth and the heroic human drama and epic engineering that shaped a continent.</p>

<p>Review
Railroad fans will want to seek out a copy of Shout! Factory’s latest 4K UHD release: Rocky Mountain Express…. The vistas are stunning and the tree-covered mountains and cool, flowing rivers are absolutely beautiful. It is an attractive part of the country and this film is the next best thing to seeing it for yourself &ndash;DVDTalk, July 2, 2016</p>

<p>This is a terrific Ultra HD presentation that looks superb on my large screen…. Whether it be the finest minutia in physical features of the 2816’s interior/exterior, or the majestic vistas of the Canadian mountain regions, the imagery is breathtaking &ndash;AVSForum, June 30, 2016</p>

<p>If you love trains&hellip;or just lush cinematography, you should enjoy the ride through the Canadian countryside that makes up much of &lsquo;Rocky Mountain Express&rsquo; &ndash;highdefdigest.com, June 30, 2016</p>

<h5 id="i-have-a-lot-to-learn">I have a Lot to Learn!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>20 years ago my young son and I used to ride our bikes down to the train station in our little California town of Moorpark. We would wait to watch for the freight trains come through as they rumbled through the station. Sometimes on a rare occasion an old steam engine would come through.He had g-scale trains and an electronic sound station train whistle played through our sound system. His older sister did not like that one bit!We had lots of train videos and watched them frequently. Today he is grown and I am an old guy, but I love technology.I saw this video and I had to have it to view with my son on our LG UHD TV through our nice sound system. I bought the 4k version that comes with a regular blu ray. I found out the hard way that my Sony and Samsung 4k upconverting blu ray players will not play the 4k disk. I was disappointed, but the blu ray was beautiful with great sound. So when the actual 4k players become more reasonable price wise, I&rsquo;ll get one. The history lesson and beautiful scenery was worth it!</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-in-4k-absolutely-jaw-dropping-in-4k-hdr">Beautiful in 4K&hellip;Absolutely Jaw-Dropping in 4K HDR&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My review is solely about the 4K version.The disc asks you whether to play it in HDR or &lsquo;Standard&rsquo; mode.In my haste, I accidentally pushed &lsquo;Standard,&rsquo; watched the whole thing, and was impressed.Later, it occurred to me that I should go back and compare the HDR version,and oh my! My appraisal went from &ldquo;Very good&rdquo; to &ldquo;OMG! This is stunning!&ldquo;In a nutshell, 4K is a big step forward, but HDR is (in my opinion) an even bigger stepforward, re. a gorgeous, life-like picture. For those about to buy a 4K TV, make sure it has HDR(most will, now, in 2017).</p>

<h5 id="lousy-audio">Lousy audio</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The video was nice. The narrator audio was way too low and the music was way too loud.Terrible audio. Whoever mixed it for release as a 4k movie did a lousy job. Worst I have ever tolerated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 4K UHD and Dolby Atmos on this disc is the best I&rsquo;ve seen/heard yet. If you&rsquo;re a rail fan you need to buy this. Put&rsquo;s you right in/on the engine with some of the best shots I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a train film. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have an Atmos system and when I cranked it up, it was just like sitting in the cab or standing on the platform when a steam engine train arrives. If you&rsquo;re not a rail fan you need to buy this for the history, scenery and all around entertainment. Unfortunately, as with most IMAX films, it&rsquo;s only 45 minutes long. Shame.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-by-far-the-most-peaceful-and-life-like-picture-i-have-enjoyed-on-tv">it is by far the most peaceful and life-like picture I have enjoyed on TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stunning landscape is vividly depicted by the highly skilled cinematographer. The railroad is accompanied by this tranquil unstained land such enjoyable when you finished a whole day of toil. However, the depth of this documentary seems superficial, it neither breathtakingly brought forth the marvelous projects of the railroad build in details or did it convey information behind the railroad in an interesting fashion. To be frank, I should not compare this to BBC documentary, such as Planet Earth. But considering it is a 4K HDR documentary, it is by far the most peaceful and life-like picture I have enjoyed on TV.</p>

<h5 id="i-missed-this-in-theaters-so-was-pleased-to-see-it-available-here-at-a-good-price">I missed this in theaters so was pleased to see it available here at a good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a major fan of Imax movies and have seen many over the years. I missed this in theaters so was pleased to see it available here at a good price. I&rsquo;ve already watched it twice and will have some friends over to watch it again. The placement of the Imax cameras is superb. The sound is first rate. The history lesson is worth the price of admission. Highly recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-demo-video-as-well-as-a-good-film-for-railroad-fans">Excellent demo video as well as a good film for railroad fans</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I must admit that, while I am a rail fan, I got this disc primarily for use as a means of evaluating or demonstrating 4K UHD, and it does not disappoint. The close-up locomotive details, helicopter fly-bys, and dramatic Canadian scenery are tremendous in ultra high resolution. Even those not particularly fascinated by trains will find something to enjoy in this film.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-photography">Great photography!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this beautifully filmed history of the Canadian railroad. Fascinating historical photos and video are included in the telling of how the railroad was built. 4K quality is absolutely mesmerizing. The music background is worth the cost of the video just by itself. Love this! Have watched 3 times.</p>

<h5 id="i-don-t-review-many-films-but-i-had-to-throw">I don&rsquo;t review many films but I had to throw &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t review many films but I had to throw my two cents in to praise this one. An epic about building a railroad, with thrilling state-of-the-art-you&rsquo;re-on-the-train footage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="rocky-mountain-express">Rocky Mountain Express</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked it so much in the IMAX theater that I have been waiting for it to be released on disc! It was a thrill to get it and see it.</p>
