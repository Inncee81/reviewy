<h5 id="warning-manufacturer-does-not-honor-warranty-unless-is-purchased-directly-from-them-or-authorized-seller">Warning, Manufacturer does not Honor Warranty unless is purchased directly from them or authorized seller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product, but fails 100% in reliability and manufacturer warranty.I&rsquo;m writing this review to warn buyer&rsquo;s of this manufacturers warranty policy. I purchased mine on July of this year, fulfilled by amazon and just today popped the E9 Code which description states that it needs to be returned to manufacturer for replacement. I called Nuwave and spoke a rep named Selena. She refused to take the product due to the fact that it was purchased from a non authorized seller ( I purchased this from &ldquo;Lowest_Price_Highest_Quality_Fastest_Shipping and fulfilled by Amazon&rdquo; ). She mentioned that pretty much it needs to be purchased directly from them or one of the few authorized sellers for them to honor it. First time I come across a situation like this. Not even 3 months out of the box.Thankfully Amazon came to the rescue. I gave them a call and a prepaid return label was emailed to me and it is on the way back to Amazon for a refund to my account.So to any thinking about buying this, keep in mind the manufacturer won&rsquo;t take the unit back unless you purchase from them directly or an authorized seller</p>

<h5 id="does-anybody-check-the-temperatures-i-do-not-know-what-happened-to-new-model">Does anybody check the Temperatures I do not know what happened to new model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the 3rd 1800 watt Nuwave/Nuwave look alike I bought this week and every one of the is a joke. I had hopes for this Titanium model but in my heating of water to 110F, I stopped the test at 158F in disgust as my Beurre Blanc butter sauce if I had tried to make it would have been ruined as it breaks down a little over 115F. It made no difference whether I was using 600, 900, or 1800 watts as the temperature was as indicated above. Another unit that did not have variable wattage, I let 110F water test continue but stopped it at 207.7F.I have no idea what has happened to these new models as I have had 6 before these over the past several years and I used them for proofing yeast and making yogurt and they were spot on temperature wise all across the temperature spectrum from 100-575 (Many time usung cast iron Lodge grill pan the temperature easily exceeded 575.If I could say a positive for this unit it would be that it heats but to me the main advantage of this over any other induction stovetop unit was its great temperature regulation which based on the past three units I purchased this week is non-existant.People if you have the unit and really just want a modified hotplate you would be pleased, but if you like me require precise temperature regulation you might be as disgusted as I am. If you need proper temperatures you might want to test them up to 210 wirh a container, water, and an instant read thermometer. Above 210 I would use a laser digital thermometer.Right now after purchasing more than 8 of these things by NuWave over the years, I am trying to contact an executive in the company as clearly they have problems that did not exist with the older units (until they too no longer functioned on Sear).</p>

<h5 id="this-product-on-our-very-first-rv-trip-and-love-it-it-works-as-advertised-and-is-very">&hellip; this product on our very first RV trip and love it. It works as advertised and is very &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this product on our very first RV trip and love it. It works as advertised and is very fast. I bought cookware specifically made for induction or gas cooking because the magnet test on my cookware from home was not very reliable. This PIC Titanium model was really nice because it gave me a larger heating area than some of the older models. I also love the ability to change temperature in smaller increments. I normally cook on a gas range so the induction cooking took a little getting used to. Things heat so quickly it is easy to burn or overcook food if you are not careful. Though the cooking surface stays cools where there is no pan, there is some radiant heat around the bottom of the pan itself so be careful if touching the cooktop surface near the pan. Love the feature to take the pan off the cooking surface for a few moments to add ingredients, then resume cooking as soon as the pan touches the surface again. Highly recommend this product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-quite-like-i-thought">Not Quite like I thought</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After seeing and using this model, The actual heating surface seems like it is very small. I was under the impression that it had a 12 inch heating surface. This one does not seem to have it or doesn&rsquo;t work properly. It doesn&rsquo;t boil nearly as quickly as I expected either. It does seem to hold a temerature pretty well but the jury is still out. I&rsquo;m going to measure the killowatt hours it uses. I&rsquo;m not nearly as impressed as I should be and If I was buying another one, personally I would likely opt for one less expensive.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-alternative-to-a-gas-stove">Great little alternative to a gas stove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this unit as an alternative to the crappy electric stove in our house and am very impressed. I had bought a couple of cheaper units from other manufacturers before and had been pleased with induction cooking, but the cheap ones always broke within a few months. The NuWave seems to be of much higher quality and provides quick, even and very controllable heat. It also doesn&rsquo;t have the really annoying alarm that indicates your pan isn&rsquo;t on the burner that all the cheaper units regrettably come with. I&rsquo;ve only had it now for a month so time will tell on the reliability but at least for now it has become my absolute go to cooking device for the house. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-guess-is-that-this-is-the-best-in-its-price-range">My guess is that this is the best in its price range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has fine temperature control and accepts a good range of pan diameters. Some features need to be reviewed in the manual - e.g. by default it&rsquo;ll shut down after an hour which may surprise you the first time it happens (not now that you&rsquo;ve been warned), but it can be adjusted. And &lsquo;fine control&rsquo; means &lsquo;precision&rsquo; but not necessarily &lsquo;accuracy&rsquo;. With a small pot, water boiled when the setting was about 220F, with a shallow wide pan a much higher number is necessary. Neither should be reasons not to buy this.(My full-sized range is induction; I&rsquo;d not have anything else. This is for table-top use. I&rsquo;ve used at least one other portable unit.)</p>
