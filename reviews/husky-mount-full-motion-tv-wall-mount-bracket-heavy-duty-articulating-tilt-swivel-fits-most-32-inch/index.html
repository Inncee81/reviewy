Two factors will determine whether it&rsquo;s compatible with your TV:- VESA patterns: It has standard VESA patterns up to 200x200.

<h5 id="installs-easy-looks-good-i-recommend">installs easy, looks good. I recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works good for me. I bought 2 and put it on 40 inch televisions. they look good and swivel around nicely. i recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-sturdy-it-wasn-t-the-cheapest">Very sturdy. It wasn&rsquo;t the cheapest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very sturdy. It wasn&rsquo;t the cheapest, and was by far from the most expensive, but the price was well worth the quality of this mount. I bought two and mounted two 32&rdquo; TV&rsquo;s (8 lbs. each). One seems to lean a bit. The mount is level and the arms are level until the end. However, I tried to use a drill to get the screws into the stud and it was too powerful - stripped the screws and gave a hard knock to the mount. This could be the problem. I bought new screws and a ratchet and then had no further problems. I wouldn&rsquo;t worry even with a heavier TV as these seem very well made.</p>

<h5 id="really-works-on-our-32-inches-lg-tv">really works on our 32 inches LG tv</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>because i want more space in our bedroom thats why i want to put our tv in the wall and iv been searching for a tv wall mount for how many days and im very happy iv found this one coz it really works on our 32 inches LG tv,really fit perfectly..it is very easy to install,as a 30 weeks pregnant i was able to do it with a little help from my husband (husband so tired from work thats why he told me that he will install it on the nxt day but i cant wait thats why i tired it and i did it..lol)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this to mount a 32&rdquo; flat panel Samsung LCD television in my workout room. I need the television to be up higher so I can see over my workout equipment.The mount came with all the hardware needed to install. My husband only needed his drill, a stud finder, a pencil, and a level to get it perfectly straight. Even though the tv is 32&rdquo; it actually measures 41&rdquo; diagonally due to the speakers being located on each side. The tv fit well within the weight limit so no worries.It didn&rsquo;t take very long to install. Since we needed to find a stud and I needed to figure out just the right height, it probably took about 20-25 minutes to install. It did take both of us to install it as one person needed to hold the tv while the other had to screw the mount into the tv. Make sure to measure the holes on the back of your tv to make sure it will fit the VESA measurements listed in the product description.Overall I am glad I purchased this mount. It is super secure and didn&rsquo;t break the bank. I like that I can tilt it to a degree and also move it laterally to suit me. The only thing left to do is hide the ugly cords dangling from my tv.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-mount-at-a-terrific-price">Excellent mount at a terrific price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent mount. I have a Sylvania LD320SSX and I measured the holes on the back at 8&rdquo; apart in a square, crossed my fingers and bought this mount and it worked perfectly. The mount was very easy for me to install even though I was doing it at work where they have metal studs instead of the traditional wood studs. It came with everything I needed and more. Four different kinds of mounting screws to mount the TV to the bracket (which was good for me because I inherited this tv and had no mounting screws), and hardware to mount the bracket to a concrete wall or a drywall/stud type wall. It took me about 15 minutes total. The other thing I really appreciated was the proactive emails the vendor sent letting me know who to contact if I had any questions, assuring me if there were problems they would help do anything they can. Letting me know the package was arriving soon and they were there if needed any assistance or to help me do an exchange if I bought the wrong mount. It was a perfect customer service experience even though I had no problems.The mount itself is a great articulated arm mount. It sits about four inches off of the wall, so not flush, but not any more depth than most wall mounts I&rsquo;ve seen. Fully articulated, it holds my 32&rdquo; tv (older model, so the actual outside edge of the case is more like a 42&rdquo; TV) and lets me turn it almost fully edgewise coming out from the wall (perpendicular to the wall). Very handy for use in my office to point it at my desk or point it towards people I&rsquo;m meeting with and demonstrating something to.All in all it&rsquo;s a great mount and a great price.</p>

<h5 id="great-easily-installed-product">Great Easily Installed Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is very sturdy and basically, ready to go. This is my second install due to the quality of the product and its easy install. I&rsquo;ve mounted a 32&rdquo; LG flat screen; and, a 32&rsquo; Samsung flat screen&ndash;the hardware comes with all the mounts and screws that you need. Both TVs were mounted on the wooden beams that are in each room. We&rsquo;re in earthquake country so it&rsquo;s important to make sure that everything is attached to beams throughout the house. The product is so easy to install that I was able to finish, mount the TV, and hook up the cables and power to the TV in 40 minutes. (Note: That includes uninstalling the mounts and hardware for an old Analog TV&hellip;..the Husky Mount has a much cleaner look &ndash; because you cant&rsquo;s see it&hellip;you only see the Flat Screen TV suspended in air &ndash; :-). The follow-up by their Small Business Associates is a nice touch in the current business environment. They provide all of the contact information to ensure that their product meets your expectations. Refreshing. I would recommend this product for those individuals who need a reliable product that is easily installed.</p>

<h5 id="good-quality-don-t-be-intimidated-by-the-extra-hardware-and-multiple-mounting-options">Good quality. Don&rsquo;t be intimidated by the extra hardware and multiple mounting options</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well made. Received it today and had it up on the wall in no time. Company sent me an e-mail right away asking if I had any questions, as it is compatible with many TV&rsquo;s , so you get tons of extra hardware and mount options information.My advise. Hold your TV up to the mounting bracket and pick out the holes that line up for your TV, then use any existing fasteners already mounted on the back of your TV if it will workTHE ONLY HARDWARE I HAD TO USE THAT CAME WITH THE MOUNT WERE 3 BOLTS and 3 WASHERS TO ATTACH THE MOUNT TO THE WALL.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-product-amazing-customer-service">Outstanding Product - Amazing Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You wanna talk about a great product with even better customer service? These husky guys are it. I ordered two of these brackets for my dad. One bracket fit his first TV just fine, the other needed an adapter.I didn&rsquo;t get after asking about an adapter until several weeks after I bought the brackets and they still sent me one, no charge. Great product- amazing customer service.</p>
