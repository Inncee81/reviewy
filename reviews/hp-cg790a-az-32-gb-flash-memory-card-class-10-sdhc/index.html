Product Description
High Speed SDHC flash memory cards from HP are ideal for the latest Digital SLR Cameras, laptops and recording in 1080p HD video. These flash memory cards are rated Class 10, which translates to faster storage to capture more action, so you can be ready for any of life’s adventures.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Standard Speed vs
Hi-Speed Flash Memory</p>

<p>STEP UP TO HIGH SPEED FROM HP!
You don&rsquo;t need to be a professional to utilize a Class 10 SDHC Card…
Designed for the enthusiast and pro photographer, the 32GB Professional Series SDHC card from HP is designed for high speed, high capacity, continuous mode shooting from your digital SLR and HD video recorder. These cards are perfect for capturing action or low light photos, allowing you to handle more frames per second for the critical shot. The Class 10, 133x speed rating and lifetime warranty translates to 20MB/s write speeds for ultimate performance and reliability.</p>

<p>What do 20MB/s write speed and Class 10 mean for me?
How does that speed rating affect me, and my photos or videos? Well, you don&rsquo;t have to be a professional photographer to utilize a Class 10 card, and the increased 20MB/s write speed can make a difference. Say you have a little one around the house and you&rsquo;re chasing after him with your camera snapping away. The card&rsquo;s 20MB/s transfer rate will allow you to take more photos in a shorter period of time, so whether you&rsquo;re in and around the house, or at the soccer game, the faster Class 10 card will enable you to capture more of those special moments.</p>

<p>What is Class 10 Speed Rating?
The SD Association has created and defined 4 speed classes to help you identify speed and guaranteed performance capabilities/minimum requirements of SD/SDHC cards and their host products. The ratings define flash memory cards that are capable of storing video. Higher class ratings such as Class 10 translate to higher quality video capture. In the case of PNY&rsquo;s Professional Class 10 card, they are guaranteed to record 1080p HD video which requires at least 10MB/s transfer rates. Speeds are reflected in megabytes per second (MB/s).</p>

<h5 id="top-of-the-class-among-all-budget-priced-class-10-cards-i-have-tested">Top of the class among all (budget-priced) Class-10 cards I have tested</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased this HP CG790A-AZ 32 GB Flash Memory Card Class 10 SDHC, mostly because it is budget-priced (similar class-10 32GB card from Sandisk would cost nearly twice as much). To my surprise, this HP card turns out to be faster than all my other class-10 cards.I used a benchmark program called &ldquo;H2testw v1.4&rdquo; to find out the write speed for large (1GB) files. This is essentially the same as the sequential-write speed used for SD card speed ratings. To qualify as a class-10 card, the card must be able to sustain sequential-write speed of 10MB/s.Here are the results for all my class-10 SDHC cards:- HP CG790A : 15.1MB/s (* see update)- Transcend TS16GSDHC10E : 14.6MB/s- PNY P-SDHC16G10 : 13.6MB/s- Kingston SD10G2/16GB: 10.7MB/s- Wintec Filemate 3FMSD32GBC10-R: 10.2MB/s(See the chart I uploaded to &lsquo;Customer Images&rsquo;)For completeness sake, I also benchmarked this HP card using other programs, including &ldquo;Flash Memory Toolkit v2.0&rdquo; and &ldquo;CrystalDiskMark 3.01&rdquo;. The results are even more impressive (see &lsquo;Customer Images&rsquo; section for details). The HP card delivered excellent write speed for both large and small files, while all other cards performed poorly for smaller files.Of course, the REAL benchmark needs to be done in the actual application. For that, I inserted each card in my Canon Rebel T1i, set it to save both RAW and JPEG formats, then took 10 consecutive shots in burst mode. Again, the HP card is the fastest, taking only 16.7s to save all 250MB of data. In contrast, the slowest card (Wintec Filemate) took 28.3s to finish.Bottom Line:This HP SDHC card, despite of its low cost (I picked &ldquo;Amazon Frustration Free Packaging&rdquo;), is actually the fastest among all class-10 cards I have tested. That makes it the best deal in my book.[Update on June 26, 2012]I purchased another HP 32GB SDHC card, because the current price (66 cents per GB) is just too good to pass up. The read/write speed of the second card is identical to that of the first one. So the quality is consistent.[*Update on May 24, 2013]The old card reader I used (Transcend M5) was limiting the speed of this HP class-10 card. I re-ran the H2testw benchmark with a new Transcend USB 3.0 Card Reader (TS-RDF5K), and the Write speed jumped from 15.1 to 21.3MB/s. The Read speed also jumped from 18.1 to 30.1MB/s, which is limited by the USB 2.0 port I used. I should expect even better results if I had a USB 3.0 port.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="hp-s-class-10-sdhc-card-excellent-performance-better-than-10mb-s">HP&rsquo;s Class 10 SDHC Card: Excellent performance, better than 10MB/s</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SD cards seem to be getting better and faster with time and customer needs, which is good for all of us. We often make the mistake of buying SD cards for our digital cameras that are too slow, then wondering why the performance seems to lag when shooting fast sequential images, video files, or even more importantly to some of us, when we are trying to save RAW images as opposed to the standard JPG files.This HP 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card was a pleasant surprise, and though I might have initially overlooked any HP cards in favor of some of the more popular brands, this one turned out to be quite good&hellip; and at the time of purchase, an exceptional buy, and quite competitive. Check the specs and you&rsquo;ll see that these are actually made by PNY. SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) cards like this go up to 32 GB, and should be able to write to the camera at a sequential-write speed of 10MB/sec as per the standards. This one was ordered with the Amazon Frustration Free Packaging, and you still get the standard plastic SD card holder when ordered this way.There are many benchmarks that one can use, and I ran the freeware H2testw 1.4 program on my Windows 7 notebook to test the card, along with Michel Machado&rsquo;s F3 program on the MacBook Pro. Note that these are both programs designed to not only test flash memory capacity, but to detect counterfeit USB drives. Running H2testw 1.4 on the PC resulted in a benchmark between 15.0MB/s and 15.1MB/s, which puts it right up there with the best of the SDHC cards.But benchmarks mean very little if your camera cannot handle the SDHC card. Older digital cameras may not, so check check the manufacturer&rsquo;s specs. My concern was to be able to write RAW and sequential JPG files to the camera, as some lesser cards can be miserably slow with this. Found that this card worked well with my Nikon D5000, Nikon P7700 and Nikon P7100 with both sequential writes and RAW (NRW) files as well. It goes without saying that you should always remember to format your card in the specific camera you planning using it with for optimum card performance, and that&rsquo;s true for any card you use.These cards are available in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sizes, though for this user, the 8GB size is a personal standard as I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;card swapper,&rdquo; a habit that goes back to 35mm camera days when we would change film for color transparencies, b&amp;w, etc. If I was shooting more videos, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to go for the larger HP CG790A-AZ 32 GB Flash Memory Card Class 10 SDHC from the results that I&rsquo;ve seen from this 8GB card.The HP 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card has proven to be a pleasant surprise, not just in terms of it&rsquo;s unexpected speed and performance, but in terms of value for the dollar. It&rsquo;s an excellent performer that exceeds the Class 10 specs by quite a bit, which makes it an easy one to recommend.11/15/2012READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-great-and-made-me-aware-i-needed-a-firmware-upgrade-for-my-camcorder">Works great and made me aware I needed a firmware upgrade for my camcorder&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased these for my Canon HD camcorder. The manual for the camcorder showed it could take class 6+ but found out it could not handle class 10 (for higher FPS setting) unless I got a firmware upgrade from Canon. So sent the camcorder in for the firmware update and everything worked as I wanted! Now I can use these cards to their full potential!Playing form the card directly on the camcorder and via HDMI on the HD TV seems fine - but I had to downgrade to SD to put movies on DVD and then they don&rsquo;t look too bad but I think I loose to much due to fps speed since it looks a bit &ldquo;choppy&rdquo; at times.I got these as a deal last year and they&rsquo;ve worked great for me. Make sure your device can handle the class 10 SDHC cards otherwise you might run into issues (like I mentioned above, I did need to get a firmware upgrade for the camcorder).</p>

<h5 id="great-for-my-canon-t3i">Great for my Canon T3i</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I snapped this up after I received an email from Amazon announcing it was on sale. It is a considerable upgrade from my 16GB Class 10 from another brand which I was very happy with. I tested this card out yesterday when I received it, and so far so good! I shot a 10 minute video without incident and with plenty of room left over on the card. I am very pleased with this purchase! Since I shoot in raw, I find that my 16 GB fills up quickly when I am on vacation so I anticipate that this card will be a true asset to me.</p>
