<h5 id="great-purcahse-for-small-mouths-if-you-want-white-teeth">Great Purcahse for Small Mouths/ if you want White teeth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend buying this toothbrush model.I never thought to buy one of these because of the price, and the price for the replacement heads. But on a whim I bought this because it was the most simple model and I was desperate after leaving the dentist with a million cavities (I just had two but it felt like a million).It made a huge difference. It even helped to make my teeth whiter and I didn&rsquo;t use whitening products (I do now and it&rsquo;s even better). I also returned to the dentist twice since I last bought this and had no problems at all. They even noticed my whiter teeth.I also love that the head is slightly smaller than a regular brush. My mouth is pretty small so a smaller brush made it easier to get the back molars.I tried using it with heads that weren&rsquo;t Philips brand, and it worked fine&mdash;just that the two minute time stopper did not work&ndash;that may have been a fault of the cheaper brush heads though, and not this Philips base.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="respectable-but-not-extraordinary">Respectable but Not Extraordinary</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first electric toothbrush. I wish I&rsquo;d done my homework; I didn&rsquo;t know they came with different settings, cleaning cycles, and other bells and whistles. This one starts off gentle when you first use it and gets gradually more intense in the vibrations &ndash; it basically has a &ldquo;training mode&rdquo; when you first get it (for the first ten brushes or something) and after that its automatically one speed all the time. Knowing now that they sell toothbrushes with a &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; setting, I would have bought a different model. It auto shuts off after 2 minutes, which is fine if you care about that. Half the time I hit the button and go &ldquo;turn back on, I&rsquo;m not done yet!&rdquo; and half the time I hit the button and go &ldquo;turn off now, I&rsquo;m late, good enough!&rdquo;. (FYI: it will auto shut off, but you can turn it right back on with no fuss). This has proven to be too basic for my needs (I have a lot of dental issues), but for others its probably great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-toothbrush-for-the-price">Great toothbrush for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had been using the same sonicare toothbrush since I was probably about 9 years old (I am now 23). The toothbrush finally died and would no longer charge and i was devastated because i didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever find a toothbrush like it (that wasn&rsquo;t ridiculously expensive!). Thankfully, I found this toothbrush and it works just as well as my old toothbrush. It holds a nice charge for quite a while so it&rsquo;s not necessary to take the charger on a short vacation. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth and is not too big to fit in the small areas of my mouth. I highly recommend buying this toothbrush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="check-the-price-of-replacement-toothbrush-heads">Check the price of replacement toothbrush heads</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this, and the unit works well, as expected based on the reviews that I read. Unfortunately, I only read the reviews on the whole unit, and didn&rsquo;t think to read those about the replacement toothbrush heads themselves. Phillips designed it so that you have to replace about half of the whole unit, and they charge you accordingly. It&rsquo;s kind of like buying a computer printer for next to nothing, and then having to spend a fortune on the ink cartridges. Yes, there are some &ldquo;generic&rdquo; brushes without the head that you can buy, but the reviews seem to indicate that it&rsquo;s next to impossible to get the original one off to install the replacement, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be trying those. If I had known this, I might have gone with a different brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-was-annoyed-by-the-24-hour-waiting-period-for-the-initial">I was annoyed by the 24 hour waiting period for the initial &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously owned a quad-pacer model which lasted more than five years. This one lacks that notification feature, and I miss it. I bought this model because I had on hand six replacement brushes for the defunct model that I was replacing. I was annoyed by the 24 hour waiting period for the initial charge. Also the charging stand is flimsy compared with the older one (which, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t work with the newer one), and despite my fastidious attempts to clean the bottom of the toothbrush each time before replacing it in the charger, enough toothpaste residue persists which acts like glue so that when you pick up the toothbrush to use it again the whole charge apparatus comes up with it, stuck to the bottom of the brush.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-at-a-great-price">High quality at a great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was recommend a Sonicare by my dentist 7 years ago and went for it. At the time it cost me well over $100. That one finally died on me so I checked the options and came upon this. It is that exact same toothbrush I had for much less than I originally paid for my first one. The only difference was the blue coloring on this one, but it&rsquo;s a toothbrush who really cares about the color.I believe it cleans well, my dentist still recommends the Sonicare line. As for holding a charge, I have no complaints. I take the charger for anything over a week, but other than that it seems to last just fine. Likely to decrease with age though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-impressed-yet-loud-splattery-and-not-clean-feeling">Not impressed yet. Loud, splattery, and not clean feeling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 2 weeks of use, I have to say I am not terribly impressed. This is my first &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; toothbrush, but I have used many different electric toothbrushes over the years. The first thing I noticed was that if your teeth accidentally touch the back of the brush while it is on, it makes an uncomfortable and ear-rattling buzz. Not fun first thing in the morning pre-coffee. The brush head is also very small, so it is more difficult to get all-over coverage. Using the brush with toothpaste is another challenge. If you turn the brush on with paste before putting it in your moutg, it will vibrate right off! If you dont turn off the brush before taking it out, it will turn your bathroom mirror into a minty-fresh Jackson Pollock painting.Overall, it seems like my teeth should be cleaner, but often they still seem filmy even after a long brushing. I&rsquo;m giving it another 2 weeks before I go back to my trusty $7 generic electric</p>
