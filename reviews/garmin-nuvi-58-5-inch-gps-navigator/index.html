<blockquote>
<p>From past few weeks i was using Garmin 2597 lmt which is one of the top line gps from Garmin and listed as one of the best selling at Amazon so my expectation with this new Garmin 58 LMT were high and i can say that Garmin has done a good job in this 2015 essential series gps. GPS comes with America and Canada maps pre-installed though firmware was not latest so i have to update the same using Garmin express tool downloaded from their website. Update process hardly took 2 minutes. One of the best part i liked in this GPS is that it has foursquare database in it which itself is worth enough to spend little extra money as compare to some other Garmin gps (of course for those people who do not have data plan on their phones). Search is instant and it returns the result from foursquare database as well as from Garmin standard POI point of interest database. It start displaying search results as you type and calculations of routes is instant. Satellite connectivity performance is same as Garmin 2597 and it takes 1 to 5 seconds to connect. Power button takes the GPS to standby mode so when next time you switch it on you get the screen right away to start typing instead of reloading everything which usually happens when you reboot the device. Up Ahead feature is same as Garmin 2597 so no changes in this feature. One important thing i noticed is sound quality of speaker. Sound is loud and lot better than 2597 model which was very poor though 58 model does not have Bluetooth feature. Design wise this unit is curvy and gives rubber/plastic mix feeling when in hand and does not seem that it will slip from hands. i have to yet test traffic and direct access features so will keep updating this review in next few days. I noticed that if your vehicle is not moving and still powered on and GPS cable is plugged in it automatically check&rsquo;s the traffic on your route in approximately in 3 to 4 minutes which indicates it triggers GPS to check why vehicle is not moving is it because of traffic. Other than that I noticed that during the traffic GPS starts displaying orange line over the pink line which usually display the route of your destination, so that&rsquo;s the indication that there&rsquo;s a delay on the route you are on (I observed this on Snow day when traffic was very very slow).Pros&hellip;1. Fast searching as you type and results include foursquare results too2. Fast Satellite connectivity mostly within 2 seconds and rarely more than 5 sec depending upon where you are standing and surrounding environment (When GPS is powered on from Sleep mode). I am noticing that 90% of the time when i wake up GPS by pressing power button it is already connected to satellite and ready to type for searching location. So 2 seconds wait no longer applicable most of the time.3. recalculation of the route is fast in case you miss the exit and no voice prompt of recalculating&hellip;infect you get the new route within 5 seconds4. Sturdy stand and GPS holds solid tight and you can rotate the screen conveniently5. Screen contrast is good and maps is vivid even during full sunlight (you can increase the brightness setting)6. Speaker Sound quality is clear and loud7. Maps on this GPS unit shows Parking lots of outlets along with dotted pink line which guide you to drive in the direction of the outlet you have choose to drive. So if you choose to drive to macys then it takes you near the gate of macys. Really useful feature.Cons&hellip;1. Do not have Bluetooth option2. Mexico Maps are not included3. Less than 500 MB free space on device which indicates it will run out of space in few map updates and will eventually have to add micro SD card in next year or so4. Garmin Website neither manual specify the hardware description like what speed of CPU and RAM/Memory is used in this GPS (This is problem with all GPS manufacturer&rsquo;s as they don&rsquo;t declare the hardware specifications), so i can&rsquo;t evaluate which model to choose between essential or Advance series depending upon which will give me better performance and whether my extra money spent is worthwhile or not ?5. Charging cable is made of some hard material which sometimes irritate you when it gets tangled in winters due to cold climate (Soft circular rubberized cable would have better alternate (No big deal though))6. Led indicator on charging cable is orange in color and dim in brightness so could be pros or cons depending upon your taste7. Does not have moving lane guidance feature which tells you which line to be in (feature called Active lane guidance in Garmin 2597LMT GPS)This GPS is capable of *<strong><em>Backup Camera Compatible - Take the worry out of reversing with the BC 30 Wireless Backup Camera (purchased separately)</em></strong>It gives me the indication that this GPS should have little better CPU to handle the backup camera load as compare to GPS which does not support this feature. May be Garmin support can comment on this and let us know the CPU difference between 2597 Vs 58 model (I hope they are reading this review here as most of the time they do respond to users questions in review).Bottom line is past years Garmin&rsquo;s Advance Series is now 2015 year&rsquo;s Essential series !!!</p>

<h5 id="very-poor-traffic">Very poor traffic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Tom Tom doesn&rsquo;t update properly due to lack of memory so I decided it was time for a new GPS. This one is rated high by Consumers Reports and got fairly good reviews so I made it my choice.I&rsquo;m very impressed with most of its functions but Garmin should be ashame of the fact that we can get better help with traffic on our cell phones. Tom Tom has spoiled me with coverage everywhere. When I have to go crosstown I would turn it on and be directed around traffic. But Garmin don&rsquo;t have coverage in my city, Baton Rouge, the city with the highest population in the state. The coverage map shows most of the country is not covered! I blame myself for not checking this before buying.If you can get someone to ride shotgun with a cell phone save your money.!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this as a gift for my in-laws as they needed one for snowmobiling. Please be aware that if you need a GPS that includes Canada you must get this unit. I got the incorrect one that only had the United States and had to return it to get the correct one. This unit also comes with lifetime map updates and lifetime traffic.</p>

<h5 id="like-the-size-and-screen-quality">Like the size and screen quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like the size and screen quality, however, it directs me to travel further west to get to eastern LI adding at least 30 minutes to my travel time. Tried to save the route I prefer, but could not. Don&rsquo;t understand why, I have updated, but it still wants me to travel west from eastern Bronx to get to eastern LI.</p>

<h5 id="nice-unit-just-wish-mine-would-work">Nice unit, just wish mine would work.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this model for about two months and it&rsquo;s started going out. There&rsquo;s an issue with it maintaining a connection to the battery for charging. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the unit, or the cable. But it&rsquo;s disappointing that it&rsquo;s now pretty much useless.</p>

<h5 id="decent-gps-still-miss-my-tomtom">Decent GPS; still miss my TomTom</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far this is a decent GPS. I had a TomTom GO which I loved, but if finally stopped booting one day. I tried using my Nexus 5 with Google Maps, but the problem of needing good cell coverage, plus frequent crashes of the app, led me back to a dedicated unit.I am still getting used to this one. Touch sensitivity is better than my old GPS, and comparable to the phone. The big screen is a plus. Changing route options is a bit fiddly/deep. I like &ldquo;Fastest route&rdquo; when traveling long distance, and &ldquo;shortest distance&rdquo; when driving closer to home. The as-navigating display vs. the just-show-where-I-am mode was a bit counter-intuitive. The traffic alert works, but pops up in somewhat unpredictable (so far) ways.I think I&rsquo;d really like a way to do a bunch of preset stuff on my computer and upload it to the device, but I haven&rsquo;t seen a GPS that handles that well. No Linux support that I could find, so my firmware and map updates are being done via a Mac. An annoyance that isn&rsquo;t costing it a star directly - given the other issues above - but wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.The old TomTom was very stable, except when it wasn&rsquo;t - it always rebooted when traversing the Longwood Medical district in Boston/Brookline. So far this Garmin hasn&rsquo;t flaked out; fingers crossed.A plus is that it works well with the Nite-Ize Steelie mount I got. The magnet, when centered in the mounting hole on the back, still allows the standard Garmin mount bracket. This means I can use the GPS in another car with the stock suction cup mount or the non-slide dash mount I got before the Steelie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well and larger memory capacity allows for more detailed maps and directions. I take it with me whenever I will be driving on a trip, too. Purchased version that includes Canada, anticipating a summer trip there. I find the signal that we are approaching a school zone annoying since it signals every time I&rsquo;m there &ndash; off hours and weekends. Hope there&rsquo;s a way to silence this feature when I have time to review settings.</p>
