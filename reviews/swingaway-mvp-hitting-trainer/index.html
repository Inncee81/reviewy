<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-product">Very happy with this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We were thinking for so long we would set up a backyard batting cage, but being a little intimidated by the setup and cost of doing that, plus it would take up so much space in our small Southern California backyard, we were thrilled to find this SwingAway instead. We&rsquo;ve had this for a month now. Setup was ok - a little tedious getting the net on, but with two adults we set it up in about 30-45 minutes. It was probably 20-30 minutes for the frame and bungees, and 10-15 minutes for the net. We also had &ldquo;help&rdquo; from kids - you know how that can go.The best things about this product are:- Batting practice in a small space. Could be indoor or outdoor.- You never have to pick up baseballs like you would with tees or batting cages.- It really seems to help with mechanics, because if you have a bad swing you hit the bungees instead of the ball. A good swing is rewarded. A bad swing is punished.- Easy to get practice swings in daily - take a few rips each time you walk by it.- Durable construction. The frame is very sturdy. The bungees are strong, you really have to hit it hard for the ball to hit the net. For probably all pre-teen kids, they will hit the ball and it goes 1-2 feet toward the net but never hits the net.Anything I don&rsquo;t like? We folded it up and moved it inside the other day to keep it out of the rain and that was a little complicated and took a few minutes. But hey, at least it folds up at all.</p>

<h5 id="good-investment-hope-it-holds-up">Good investment. Hope it holds up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is cool. My son can really work on all of those tee type drills without having to re-tee every time. In a short amount of time, you can really get a lot of swings in. It resets itself literally in about 1-2 seconds. I can&rsquo;t even reset my body by the time it&rsquo;s ready to go again. Haven&rsquo;t really messed with the mat. Just by watching which direction the ball is going off the bat, you can get a good idea of where you&rsquo;re contacting the ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="swingaway-should-have-bought-this-years-ago">SwingAway - should have bought this years ago!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 9yr old son that plays travel ball and am always looking for useful training aids to improve his skills. We were at a tournament a few weeks ago where one of the vendors had several Swing Away&rsquo;s setup to use so we spent about 20 minutes testing it out. When we got home I promptly bought this and have been very impressed. What&rsquo;s great is that it allows the parent/coach to watch the mechanics of the swing very closely without worrying where the ball might fly off to. Even better you don&rsquo;t have to collect the ball(s) nor waste time placing them back on a tee. What I really like is being able to kneel behind the net to watch my son&rsquo;s swing, the point of contact, and the direction of the ball as it is struck. There is no way to get this close when doing live pitching (even behind an L-screen), during soft toss, or off a tee. As for the setup, everything was well packaged and it took about 30 minutes to get everything just right. The most time consuming process is installing the net onto the frame and threading the supplied &ldquo;target&rdquo; onto the net but it was not too bad. There are some good videos on the SwingAway website and YouTube that show the setup, walk thru some drills, and detail how to move the unit around for inside/outside pitches. We have ours setup in our basement so its out of the elements and will likely stay in good shape for a long time. One last benefit is that he seems to be hitting the ball &ldquo;harder&rdquo; which was one of our goals. I told him to see if he could actually get the ball to touch the net every time he swings which at this point he&rsquo;s not able to do. I imagine as he gets stronger and the elastic cords stretch out he&rsquo;ll be able to achieve this but for the time being its a good motivator and definitely building his strength and improving his swing. I&rsquo;ve also enjoyed getting my own BP in so its fun for me too!</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2 kids use this everyday and you could see the improvement within a week!Both are hitting very well and with this product you can get in twice the swings in half the time.Love it&hellip;would highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="assembly-was-very-straight-forward-and-the-detailed-instructions-made-it-very-easy-to-follow">Assembly was very straight forward and the detailed instructions made it very easy to follow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say enough about this. Assembly was very straight forward and the detailed instructions made it very easy to follow. Switching from hitting to a bounce back is very simple. The product is well made and the powder coating keeps me from having to put it away every day. On the days when I do, it&rsquo;s a 2 minute disassembly to fold it up and even easier to get it back together.Warranty is fantastic and the customer service is rated 10 stars out of 5 for response and assistance.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-for-little-leaguers-and-beyond">A must for Little Leaguers and beyond!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is one that I would recommend to all players, parents and coaches. I have been coaching for several years&hellip; &ldquo;Tee&rdquo; work is the best way to practice and work on fundamental hitting approach. For older kids.. It&rsquo;s a must&hellip; For younger kids&hellip; 6-12&hellip; Using the Swingaway is a no brainer! It allows for more reps &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; and gives the hitter feedback through striking the ball. It is a great tool at home or at the field. I highly recommend!</p>
