</ul>

<p>CamelBak Podium Chill is a high performance insulated sport bottle that keeps your water cooler longer. A double-walled bottle construction uses closed cell foam technology to keep your water cold twice as long as a standard bottle. The patented spill-proof, self-sealing Jet Valve allows the user to hydrate immediately without having to open or close a drinking interface and the bottle&rsquo;s streamlined ergonomic design offers excellent squeezability without compromising bottle grip. The large aperture of the drinking nozzle generates an exceptional water flow rate and is easy to remove for thorough cleaning. The Podium Chill also has a lockout dial with easy to read graphics for leak-proof transport.</p>

<h5 id="work-for-my-needs">Work for my needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already have two Camelbak 70oz Rogue hydration pack for the wife and I. Sometimes it is too much firepower for an hour ride for exercise and it can be a pain to clean. The 25 oz and 21 oz are the perfect size to keep us hydrated in the 95-100 degree heat in the southwest. I usually fill the bottle with ice/water before the ride. The ice is almost melted and the water is still cool by the time I need to hydrate 30-60 minutes later. My old water bottle would already be same outdoor temps by this time. Hard to cool your core if you drinking hot water.I like the power squirt feature to quickly fill you mouth to rinse/spit or drink. Easy to squirt over your head on those really hot days. The softer sides make it easy to control the amount of water you squirt into your mouth. No more biting the top to open/close the water valve like my old bottle with the Camelbak nozzle. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with the top spilling when unlocked during the ride. The bottles fit in our cheap $3 bike bottle holders very well with zero chance of bouncing out. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with plastic taste with this bottle. Since it holds ice a lot longer, no need to freeze <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> full of water the night before. Not planning on using this bottle for anything other than water to keep it fresh as possible for the long term.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-perfect-i-have-a-big-chill-21-oz-in">It&rsquo;s perfect. I have a big chill 21 oz in &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect. I have a big chill 21 oz in the downtube bottle holder and a 24 oz on the seat tube. That gets me through 50 miles of California sun. This is the best there is. You can lock the spout so it doesn&rsquo;t drip when the bike is stored sideways in the back of my car, and then open it for effortless but drip-free hydration during the ride. Somebody who actually rides a bike designed this one.</p>

<h5 id="mold-in-very-hidden-places-very-hard-to-clean-hidden-parts">Mold in very hidden places, VERY HARD TO CLEAN HIDDEN PARTS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved this bottle at first, used for water and occasiinally gatorade. I thought I was cleaning it well, running water thru spought after use, typical soap and water scrub that works well on typical water bottles. Well one day I saw a small amount off black mold in the pplastic cap in a part I did not think accesible. Well I used a screwdriver to help completely take cap apart; there is like 7 small pieces all difficult to pry apart. What I saw is mold jammed inall kinds of hidden and quite hard to get to parts. These parts are unseen normally and there is no way for them to get cleaned without totally disassembling valve. Now I know how I have to ask do you want to spend 20 minutes with bleach cleaning out your bottle valve?Btw valve works very well, and insulation is good, great bottle otherwise.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-bottle">Love this bottle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first PURCHASED water bottle. Over the years, I have used many different bottles that I was given at work events, and honestly, I chose to continue using bottled water from the grocery store and just refilled it through the day.. This Camelback is the first bottle that I really enjoy using. Why do I like it?1) Large capacity, but not so tall that it is top-heavy and falls over easily.2) Soft plastic feels good in the hand, easy to grasp firmly, and is easy to squeeze.3) double-wall construction to provide insulation to keep liquids cooler longer.4) No-spill nozzle, but no cap to unscrew when &ldquo;on the go&rdquo;.5) Lightweight6) Large cap makes this easy to clean7) No plastic taste.8) reasonable price for a quality bottle.9) The blue swirl pattern looks greatYes, I&rsquo;m happy with this. Now I can contribute fewer plastic bottles to landfills and save money, too!If you find the information in this review to be helpful, please click &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Thanks!!</p>

<h5 id="the-nozzle-is-super-useful-however-the-detachable-nozzle-on-mine-can-t">The nozzle is super useful, however the detachable nozzle on mine can&rsquo;t &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The nozzle is super useful, however the detachable nozzle on mine can&rsquo;t be cleaned completely since there is mildew within the detachable housing between the clear plastic and the nozzle. I&rsquo;ve attached photos. You can clean out about 90% of the mildew by soaking in vinegar for a few days but it grows back slowly.</p>

<h5 id="riding-bikes-is-fun-do-it-in-the-winter-with-this-bottle-it-s-better-that-way">Riding bikes is fun! Do it in the winter with this bottle. It&rsquo;s better that way.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I try not to use thermal bottles. I&rsquo;ll do almost anything to avoid using a thermal bottle. Let&rsquo;s face it though, sometimes they&rsquo;re a necessity. This one keeps cold stuff cold for a while and warm stuff warm for a while. I like to make a nice cup of tea with some honey in there, I add the tea to a water bottle half full of warm water and head out into the blustery winter on my trusty steed. After an hour it might not be really warm any more but it won&rsquo;t be frozen. It&rsquo;s all a matter of degrees really. How cold is it?</p>

<h5 id="camelback-does-it-again">Camelback does it again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered two of these water bottles and my wife and I absolutely love them. They are simple to use and very effective. I do a lot of biking and I got tired of having to open and close my old water bottle. The issue was that sometimes the water would leak or spill out when I was riding through rugged terrain. This water bottle doesn&rsquo;t allow that to happen. It keeps my water nice and cold and looks awesome on my bike. This fit in my &ldquo;stock&rdquo; water bottle cage and on the cage I bought for my wife bike off of Amazon as well. Pretty awesome water bottle for the price. I will be ordering a few more for the kids in the near future.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-kids">Great for kids!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these bottles! I have 1 for each of my 4 kids ranging from 2 yrs to 15yrs. The bottles work great for them all. They are easy to drink from and don&rsquo;t leak! My 2 yr old carries his all over the house and it does not dribble. They don&rsquo;t break when dropped, they wash up easily in the dishwasher, and they do keep water cold! I also appreciate the lock feature, which means NO using dirty fingers to pull up a spout. Their fingers never need to touch the mouthpiece to get it to work and you don&rsquo;t need to bite it to drink. My 2 year old just puts it up to his lips like a cup and sips. You do not need to cover your whole mouth over it to get water out. Great bottle.</p>

<p>Water bottle works very well. I prefer this top over the ones that squirt only. A little smaller than I thought it was but a descent size.</p>

<p>The locking system in this bottle is awesome and efficient. Bottle is fairly light and construction seems good. Will update if needed but honestly this is worth the price.</p>
