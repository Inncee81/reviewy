<h5 id="thank-you-so-much-for-such-an-amazing-value-on-this-gopro-hero-attachments-kit-i-couldn-t-be-any-happier-with-this-product">Thank you so much for such an amazing value on this GoPro Hero attachments kit! I couldn&rsquo;t be any happier with this product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was sincerely astounded by how many GoPro attachments and mounts that actually came with this kit! It makes it SO much easier to get incredible videos and pictures by having the correct GoPro mount or attachment for the job. I am VERY happy with this purchase, and would buy this again and again if I had to do it all over. So far the most used GoPro accessories I have used personally from this GoPro Kit is the GoPro Belt clip for easy slide on and off of your belt action, to take videos and pictures, and the telescoping selfie stick which works perfectly with the GoPro remote control app for your GoPro Hero 4. I now keep my GoPro stored in this kit&rsquo;s carrier bag that has a nice fitting foam insert, and helps keep everything together, organized, and protected. Thank you so much for an amazing value on this GoPro Hero attachments kit! GREAT JOB!Your Fan,Keda Dye Inc</p>

<h5 id="works-with-sjcam-and-gopro">Works with SJCAM and GoPro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything you need for the SJCAM and more!!! We were on a zip line tour and one of the other folks had the new GoPro4 and needed some attachments so they used some of the parts from this and it worked like a charm. So DO NOT buy that expensive GoPro stuff! This is very sturdy and works with SJCAM and GoPro</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-wanted">Just what I wanted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect! Everything I needed for my gopro without spending hundreds. Good quality products, highly recommend this for sure!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mostly-great">Mostly great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this in order to just get a kit that had plenty of accessories for my camera. I like all the special mounts and all the extra stuff, but the only problem I have with it is that the foam openings in the case. I wish it would have been a bit more customizable than it is. The only couple spots that seem obvious as to what they are for, are the ones for the camera and maybe a battery? Another thing that&rsquo;s wrong with this case is the handle. It should be on the opposite side. When I close it and use the handle, the case is flipped up-side down and everything in the mesh pocket slides down and out of the pocket. But then again, it&rsquo;s a very inexpensive kit for what you&rsquo;re getting!</p>

<h5 id="everything-fit-like-it-should">everything fit like it should</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The kit had everything I needed and more, everything fit like it should. I ordered it Sunday afternoon when I got home from work on Monday was on my doorstep. wow!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-fantastic-complete-accessory-set-for-less-than-the-price">This is a fantastic, complete accessory set for less than the price &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a fantastic, complete accessory set for less than the price of a chest harness from GoPro. I bought it for use with my SJCAM and all of the pieces work great. I would just notebthatbyou should not use the stick-on helmet mount with any kind of high-impact activity like biking or skiing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the included accessories uses a screw like tripods use. The kit only has two adapters from GoPro to tripod. The bicycle handle bar mount was broken after first use. I miss a graphic chart with a description of the use of each accessory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-money">Great for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall pretty decent. All the accessories you would ever need. I only really needed a few of them. I dropped a star because these are relatively cheap (although it is well worth the $20). Probably not up to the same specs as genuine gopro parts but I will not be doing much extreme stuff. The case is sturdy but the foam cutouts are a bit odd and dont fit anything really well. I would still recommend this if you want to save some money but get all the gear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-price-its-great">For the price its great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the most part great, some cheap parts (like the case). For the price its great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lots-of-things-to-play-with">Lots of things to play with.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go through everything in this kit yet, but the amount of accessories at my disposal now is pretty incredible for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-but-heck-good-enough-sometimes-is-the-key">Cheap, but heck good enough sometimes is the key!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of stuff in this kit. The quality is cheap, but heck so was the price. You can&rsquo;t have it all. Even if you use each item once and throw them away you are still WAY ahead of Go&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-package-and-a-stellar-price">Excellent package and a stellar price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little case for hauling around your action cam. Frankly i purchased the kit for one or two attachment points, and the rest are superfluous, but it&rsquo;s still a good way to&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lots-of-useful-go-pro-stuff">Lots of useful go pro stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Useful stuff for go pro, but a bit hard to figure out what some are for. (No instructions included)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-the-mounts-you-could-need-at-a-good-price">all the mounts you could need at a good price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good kit at a great price the quality is sufficient on the items the only problem i have encountered is one mounting foot snapped and a wrist strap broke on the selfie stick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple and has the parts to make better use of the go pro!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-the-price-you-really-get-a-lot">For the price, you really get a lot, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, you really get a lot, however some of the parts fell apart. For example, the trip pod broke upon first use!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-stuff">Great stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I wanted. Everything for a fraction of the cost. Great stuff</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="everything-you-could-use-for-your-go-pro-in-one-case">Everything you could use for your Go Pro in one case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super flexible for all go-pro activities &ndash; all in one place. Was a great gift for my son.</p>
