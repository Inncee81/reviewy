<h5 id="they-are-pretty-much-the-same-recognizable-characters">They are pretty much the same recognizable characters</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This movie brings fan-fiction to an art form. I would call it STAR TREK, THE OTHER WRATH OF KAHN, but I don&rsquo;t want to disrespect this movie in any way. This is the second of a series of new Star Trek movies. In the first, the writers created a clever device by which the characters, who were originally created in a 1960s television series and later moved through 4 major motion pictures, are no longer bound by their serial and cinematic histories. They are pretty much the same recognizable characters, but because they passed through a time portal, anything that was done in the past can be recognized, referenced to, and in this movie, paid homage to. For those who watch this movie who have not seen any of the preceding movies or shows, it stands alone well. It moves along well with action, humor and drama, and with very good performances from a talented cast.</p>

<h5 id="the-movie-itself-is-great-the-issue-with-the-bonus-material-not-so-much">The movie itself is great, the issue with the bonus material, not so much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fair warning there will be some slight spoilerish material in the review so if you have not seen it yet proceed with caution&hellip;Movies that are reboots of a franchise are always tricky, and then taking it a step further and making the reboot a franchise of its own can be even trickier. That is probably even more the case when the franchise is Star Trek. This does what all sequels strive to do (yet which many cannot) actually improve on the original movie.Like the first movie it blended action, drama, and humor. There was not a lot of character development in this movie since it was already done in the last one, but if you saw the first movie this one does not require a lot of set up. While all of the actors did remarkably well in their various roles the standout performance was Benedict Cumberbatch. They kept his role as much as a secret as possible when filming but it is well known that he played Khan, the most formidable villain in the original series. He stole every scene he was in and brought presence to the screen every time he was on. As good as he is in the BBC series Sherlock, he as just as good playing one of the ultimate bad guys in the Star Trek universe. Zachary Quinto&rsquo;s portrayal of Spock continued to be very well done, and he does a great job playing homage to the character that Nimoy (who has a small cameo in the film) created, but making the role his own.Like the first movie this one has twists on the events from the original series show and movies. Even though some of the scenes were similar to things that happened in the show and the movies (some in a joking way, and others as major plot points)since the timeline was changed in the first movie things do not play out exactly as expected. In fact in more than one instance the roles of Kirk and Spock are flipped in situations that occurred in The Wrath of Kahn.The movie definitely sets up themes for the next movie, including introducing the Klingons and leaving open the possibility of Khan&rsquo;s return. The &ldquo;main&rdquo; events of this movie are all resolved by the end though so there was no definitive set up for what is to come, just hints. While it is inevitable that the movies will run out of steam at some point, J.J. Abrams has done a great job with the franchise so far, and if he maintains this quality and can keep the main actors on, then he can definitely get a lot more out of it. Personally I would love to see him introduce the Borg into this timeline, but that remains to be seen.The A/V quality of the blu ray is great, and the special effects are as good or better than in the first movie. As many have pointed out the extras you get depend on where you buy the movie. Different retailers discs have different special features. There will almost inevitably be some ultimate edition kind of release down the road that will combine them all, so if you are really into getting as many bonus features as possible, then you may want to wait. The stuff that is included in the Amazon release are fine, but there is more out there.In all I think your enjoyment of the movie itself will come down to whether you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise or just like sci-fi movies in general. If you fall into the latter category I think you can definitely find this enjoyable. If you are in the former, and can accept that the movie does change things that happened in the original story you will like it. Whether you want to shell out for the discs will probably depends on where you fall on the issue of the special features. I think it warrants knocking the overall rating down a star because of the decision to split all the bonus material. The movie itself is worth seeing but if the special feature issue bugs you then you probably want to stick with a rental or streaming.</p>

<h5 id="get-ready-to-have-your-socks-knocked-off">Get ready to have your socks knocked off!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you love &ldquo;Wrath of Khan&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;The Search for Spock&rdquo;? (For me the very best of the original movie series.) Well, get ready to have your socks knocked off by this one!! It hits the ground running and never disappoints. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic and therefore fits right into the established brilliant cast. Into Darkness is even better than the 1st of the reboots because the relationships are treated in the way of the original series. More depth, more feeling. How much the main characters care for each other and their attempts to do the right thing in difficult situations is the key to why the franchise has had such a following for nearly 50 years. We care about these people. It&rsquo;s really just that simple. And we all want to believe that our world can be like the one Star Trek strives towards. It is also just plain fun and exciting! I love these movies. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know anyone who doesn&rsquo;t!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally engaging.. Enjoyed it alot. Great acting from the cast all round.. Cant really understand the negative comments and criticism. With the Blu Ray disc I could pause and contemplate the story. Not the finest story but not too shabby at all. On the same token.. Did not enjoy Star Trek Beyond. It&rsquo;s a bargain for 10$.</p>

<h5 id="action-packed-fast-paced-movie-possible-spoiler-alert">Action packed, fast paced movie: Possible spoiler alert</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Star Trek Into Darkness is an action packed, fast paced movie that will keep your attention. There are very few quiet moments in this movie as it is filled with plenty of chase scenes, Starfleet being attacked, and a run-in with the Klingons. If you like movies that have continuous action, with little character interaction, you will love Star Trek Into Darkness.I would have loved to seen a bit more interplay with the characters as I wrote earlier this movie was dependent on providing an adrenalin rush for the movie viewer. There are a couple touching scenes, one where Spock does a mind meld; and another where a key character dies while trying to accomplish an impossible task. The character succeeds but pays for his actions by dying. I won&rsquo;t write more as this would be considered a spoiler.One of the things I did not like was the depiction of the Klingons. The Klingons were a bit creepy and seemed a bit out of the mold for what Klingons typically look like.Overall, this was an excellent movie, especially if you love action movies that are less dependent on character interaction.Recommend.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-first-in-some-ways">Better than the first in some ways.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The new movies are nice and exciting, but have many errors and absurdities in them.For instance:After you raise shields, you have debris bouncing off the hull!?Photon torpedo explosions look like fire crackers when they are matter/anti-matter explosions as big or bigger than nuclear weapons!?A guy fresh from the academy placed in command of the fleet flagship&hellip;seriously!? Promoted, yes, but straight to Captain!? Please!</p>
