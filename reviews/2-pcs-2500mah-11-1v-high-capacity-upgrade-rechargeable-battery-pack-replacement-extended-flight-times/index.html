<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="ok-batteries-or-the-price-but-not-great">Ok batteries or the price but not great&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok Batteries for the price. I bought these batteries hoping that they would increase my flight time and there extend the fun of flying my Bebop, but they don&rsquo;t perform much better than the stock 1200mAh batteries. I am in the process of documenting a more accurate explanation by recording the flight times of these batteries. I will update this review after I have documented more flights. As other reviewers have pointed out, these batteries fit onto the quad, even though mine took some breaking in to fit properly (they were too tight). They both feel the same as the original batteries, but as I said last just about as long, which is around 7 - 10 minutes depending on how you&rsquo;re flying. I&rsquo;m giving these batteries 3 stars because they shipped fast and work with my drone, but they definitely don&rsquo;t perform better than the stock 1200mAh batteries that came with my quad. If you want a cheaper battery than stock I&rsquo;d buy these, but if you want extended flight times, fine another brand/model. I hope this helps someone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-batteries-but-do-not-significantly-increase-flying-time">Decent batteries, but do not significantly increase flying time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I knew that although these are rated as over twice the capacity as the original batteries, that I was not going to double flying time. However, I was a bit disappointed to find that I have only gained a minute or two at best. The original batteries provided 6-7 minutes of flying time, and these provide 7-8 minutes. They do feel almost exactly the same as the original batteries and are no worse, so I am not really unhappy with them, just disappointed.I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I have read some comments that sound as thought the drone itself is configured to read battery power in such a way that it isn&rsquo;t really able to take full advantage of higher capacity batteries. I don&rsquo;t know if that is true or not, but it seems that it may be.Two of these batteries are cheaper than buying two original batteries, so I wouldn&rsquo;t say not to buy them, just don&rsquo;t expect them to significantly increase your flying time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unremarkable">Unremarkable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries arrived on time, which is why I gave 3 stars instead of 2. The did hold a charge, and did fit into the Bebop, but they did NOT add any flight time at all. In fact, they performed about the same as the stock 1200mAh batteries.Others have gotten better results, but mine have not been stellar by any stretch. Also, they would not charge on my 3-bank charger. I have since purchased and received two 1700mAh batteries that out-performed these and work fine in the charger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-spend-the-extra-money-for-these-batteries">Don&rsquo;t spend the extra money for these batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the extended flight time advertised on these batteries. They are fine as a second set but they don&rsquo;t last any longer than the originals that came with my quad copter. I also had issues getting them to fit into the chargers. Plus shipping from china took a lot longer than most items I buy off Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-1700mah-batteries-not-2500mah">These are 1700mah Batteries not 2500mah!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shipping was great, although the delivered batteries are not an upgrade, the flight times are no better than the stock batteries, please don&rsquo;t advertise these batteries as 2500mah they are only 1700mahat best. The sticker is not an effective indicator. Performed 2 test flights and both returned results lower than expected for a true 2500mah battery. Battery weight is the same as stock.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-keep-there-charge">They keep there charge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They seem to be working well and they keep there charge like the originals.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="parrot-bebop-batteries-not-25min-flight-time">Parrot Bebop Batteries - Not 25min flight time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Batteries are charging OK now, tried one full battery flight - does not go beyond 12-13 minutes flight time! so the mention of 25 min flight time does not hold!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">DO NOT BUY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After an excessively long shipping time, both batteries are trash. Just enough cell in them to activate a charger, but not enough to fly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">GOOD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>VERY WELL, GOOD PRODUCT</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-well">Work well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they don&rsquo;t stay charged up as long as before or if it is my Bebop. It flies the same amount of time with these as with the factorey Parrot batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="was-pleased-with-the-batteries">Was pleased with the batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was pleased with the batteries. Only got 10,5. Minutes of flight but that was 4 minutes more than stock.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meh-could-do-better">Meh, could do better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries don&rsquo;t fit right on my drone which causes it to catch more air and not fly true. One of the batteries doesn&rsquo;t even work, I wouldn&rsquo;t but from here ever again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the added flight time but the batteries didn&rsquo;t quite fit my drone 3.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost 5 stars but it do not clip well in the Drone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-batteries-charge-quickly-but-seem-to-last-only">The batteries charge quickly, but seem to last only &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries charge quickly, but seem to last only about as long as the 1200 mAh original.The 4 lock in tabs at the base of the batteries will have to be modified to fit my&hellip;</p>
