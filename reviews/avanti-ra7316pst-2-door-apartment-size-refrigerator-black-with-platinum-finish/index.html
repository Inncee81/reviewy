<h5 id="works-great-in-my-rv-running-on-an-inverter-and-solar">Works great in my RV running on an inverter and solar.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to replace the AC/DC/Propane refrigerator which was in the Minnie Winnie RV we are restoring. The old 3-way power refer no longer worked, and a new one like that is more than three times the cost of this one. This fridge fit right into the same cabinet the old one came out of. The height was perfect. It is just a little narrower, but actually has a bit more interior space because the depth is greater. To fasten it n place was easy. The back is on two rollers, and there is a convenient hole next to each. I bolted it down through the floor of the cabinet. The front has leveling feet which screw in and out. I took each out completely and then screwed it back in through a steel angle. The angles fit against the front of the cabinet below the opening and are screwed in place. To keep it from rocking I put a piece of foam about 6&rdquo; square on each side near the top. It is solid and still has good circulation. I used some trim to cover the gaps on the sides.The refrigerator works perfectly, and once we adjusted it the fridge part is in the high 30s while the freezer hovers near zero. A compressor fridge like this just cools better than a propane model. We boondock quite a bit, so we need to be able to run this when camping far from shore power. I&rsquo;m an electronics guy, so I did some testing. This draws 70 watts when running, but it doesn&rsquo;t run all the time. At 80 degrees ambient temperature it runs a bit less than half of the time, so it draws only an average of 30 watts or so. Now, 36 watts is 3 amps at 12 volts. Three amps times 24 hours is 72 amp hours, and I am using a really good AGM deep cycle battery with 85 amp hours.However, I also have 200 watts of solar panels on the roof of the RV. To keep the math easy, figure they average 144 watts for 10 hours a day. 144 watts is 12 amps at 12 volts, times 10 hours, means I am getting 120 amp hours of solar charging, which is well over what the refrigerator is consuming, so, in practice, my battery stays full. If I get a few cloudy or rainy days, I just start the RV and let it idle for a little while. When the engine is running it charges the house battery at about 50 amps. Even on a cloudy day I still get quite a bit from my solar panels and it isn&rsquo;t cloudy all that much here in the southwest where we live and camp. The power for the fridge comes from a 1000 watt pure sine inverter.We did have to install some eye bolts so we can run a bungee cord across the doors when we are driving. So, now we have a great fridge, no need for a generator, and I can enjoy an ice cream bar when camping in the middle of nowhere. BTW, this arrived early in perfect condition, and the delivery guy even helped my unpack it and put it into the RV.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-fridge">Great little fridge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It fits right in where our RV fridge used to be. Cheaper than the parts to fix our old Dometic fridge. The cubic feet say it&rsquo;s slightly smaller, but we feel both the fridge and freezer section seem bigger somehow. Maybe better arrangement. LOVE the many slots to put the shelves into. Makes it easier to setup one section for tall things like milk gallons.VERY quiet.Runs on 120 watts. That&rsquo;s it!!! About like running two laptops. We run on solar frequently and it&rsquo;s nice to have such a low wattage. The Dometic needed 500watts AC when we weren&rsquo;t running on propane.Small drip tray in back was broken (probably from factory since the box and foam were in great shape). Contacted seller (Varouj Appliances), and they sent out a replacement immediately without having to return the old broken plastic like some sellers want you to do.</p>

<h5 id="avanti-is-good-package">Avanti is good package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived really well packaged, and in pristine condition. Works Well. Good Door seal. Its worth noting that mine arrived with 4 door shelves that covered the width of the door and not the small shelves pictured. All of the shelves are removable and the third shelf down has a slightly lower repositioning option if desired. It is NOT AUTO DEFROST. And has a somewhat quirky characteristic of forming frost on the inside rear wall of the refrigerator section, when the compressor is on, this then melts and is channeled away down a small hole when the compressor is off. Called a Cycle Defrost. The freezer section will require a manual defrost too. All in all the Avanti is good package for the $349 i paid for it at time of purchase. I see now that it is listed at $454 currently. I would, frankly, have been far less happy at this price point as I feel the overall build quality, while far from being poor, does not warrant a cost in excess of my original purchase cost.Its has not yet been running 24hts, and is already very cold. If the energy star rating is accurate, it is a great little energy efficient unit.Didn&rsquo;t get 5 stars from me because I would have preferred a little bit more freezer, even at the expense of a little bit less fridgeAt 7.4 Cubic its OK. A 9.9 Cubic is a more realistic size IMHO. But for what it is, and how it does it. It seems to be an excellent little unit.</p>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">Works like a charm&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We replaced a camper refrigerator with this unit. Works great, built decent.. I saw where someone said it was made cheap.. Well it isn&rsquo;t a $2,000.00 unit, but its plenty sturdy. They must be abusing it. As we have no problems with it falling apart. When we got it new, there was a dent in the door from the factory. I called them, and the next week a new one was at my door. What else can you ask for? Thumbs up to Avanti</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-fridge-1">Great little fridge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little fridge. It freezes on the back if you place items too close. So being careful what to put back there is important. The fridge also arrived damaged. The hinge on the freezer door was bent. It was too late to return due to fact the fridge was being put in a new house. We opened the crate too late&hellip;sooooooo I took off the freezer door and was able to straighten it. It works fine, but packaging and mostly handling is an issue with this seller.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No issues yet. Small frig that fits in my garage for overflow,</p>

<h5 id="for-some-reason-water-forms-on-the-inside-back-which">For some reason water forms on the inside back which &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For some reason water forms on the inside back which turns into ice rivers? Also freezes liquid items if not careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-buy-for-the-garage">Perfect buy for the garage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect buy for the garage. I keep it stocked with soda and vitamin drinks for all the neighbor hood teen agers who come here to hang out. the delivery guy said he was going to order one for his basement for beer and the games.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quite happy with the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="silent-and-easy-to-move">silent and easy to move</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fridge works amazingly; it&rsquo;s light-weight, silent and easy to move; the downside is has comparatively small space for the price, compared to what you would purchase for&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-but-everything-is-soggy">It works&hellip; But everything is soggy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super energy efficient but everything is always wet in my refrigerator. I have tried every possible setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="however-when-i-unpacked-it-there-was-a-pretty-good-dent-under-the-cardboard-that-showed-no-signs">However when I unpacked it there was a pretty good dent under the cardboard that showed no signs &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If Avanti plans on making more of these, I hope they will deal with the shipping damage. My boyfriend and I had a huge fight over this refrigerator.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-fridge-ups-can-t-seem-to-ship-without-damaging">Good fridge, Ups can&rsquo;t seem to ship without damaging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall a nice fridge. I would advise buying it through home Depot as UPS seems unable to deliver it without beating the crap out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">great value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, it&rsquo;s a great bargain! Especially if it only uses $50/year. Was kind of small, but bigger than I expected. Plenty of space for 1 single guy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-purchased-this-fridge-from-lowe-s-it-was-replacing">We purchased this fridge from Lowe&rsquo;s. It was replacing &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this fridge from Lowe&rsquo;s. It was replacing another compact fridge (that was 15 years old) in our guest cottage.</p>

<h5 id="too-small-sent-it-back">Too small. Sent it back.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too small. Sent it back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-but-has-several-small-dents">Works great but has several small dents</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great but has several small dents. The shipping crate did not show damage so I must think that this fridge had dents before it was shipped</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fridge arrived with large dent on the front door.</p>
