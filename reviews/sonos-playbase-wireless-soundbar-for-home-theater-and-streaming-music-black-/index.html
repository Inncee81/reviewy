<h5 id="the-best-speakerbase-playbar-period">The best speakerbase/playbar&hellip;period.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d read the reviews for the Sonos Playbase, and checked out a demo unit at a big box store, so I knew what I could expect going in. Is this going to replace your 5.1 or 7.1 sound system in terms of surround sound? Absolutely not. But if you&rsquo;re tired of adjusting the volume to compensate for dialogue vs sound effects, or quiet vs loud scenes, the Playbase will absolutely deliver&hellip;without sacrificing fidelity in the process. In fact, the clarity is outstanding, with movie tests revealing crystal clear nuances which would be lost with anything else (even besting the Bose!).Look, when MY WIFE says she&rsquo;s impressed, that means something, since most of the time she simply tolerates my fascination with technology without comment (even when prompted for an opinion, I get, &ldquo;Are you happy? If you&rsquo;re happy, then I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;). But in this case, she stopped dead in her tracks when she walked in the room and said, &ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s really good!&ldquo;The Playbase has a built in subwoofer that delivers plenty of bass, at least for me, although you can add a satellite sub if you want. You can even add a pair of Sonos 1s or 5s and get a fully wireless 5.1 system. It&rsquo;s all controlled by a Sonos app for either iOS or Android. One caveat, however, is that the iOS version allows you to tune the system specific to the acoustics of the room it&rsquo;s in, using the microphone of an iPhone or iPad, while the Android version doesn&rsquo;t allow for that, due to the variability of microphone sensitivity between phone manufacturers, and this room tuning can make a dramatic difference, especially in the &ldquo;width&rdquo; of the sound space.Additionally, this is the first sound bar/base that has ever passed the &ldquo;Interstellar Test&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched this movie, you probably have an idea of what I&rsquo;m talking about&hellip;a constant battle of volume adjustment because you either can&rsquo;t hear the dialogue, or you&rsquo;re getting blasted by music/effects. It&rsquo;s a real effort to watch&hellip;seriously. I&rsquo;m happy to report that the Sonos Playbase slayed this demon, and for the first time, I could just sit back, put the remote down, and ENJOY THE MOVIE with a big ole grin!Maybe that&rsquo;s enough of a fitting tribute&hellip;the Sonos Playbase is simply stellar, in my opinion (NO pun intended). For what it costs, it better freaking be worth it, and it is, for my tastes anyway.</p>

<h5 id="what-the-world-has-been-waiting-for">What the world has been waiting for!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What the world has been waiting for!Great concept – perfectly executedThere have been a few other form-factors like this before, but none of them have been able to impress like the Sonos Playbase. They were either not thin enough, thin but thin-sounding, or too small to support popular sized TV’s. In comes Sonos Playabase, and they knock it out of the park! Incredible sound AND gorgeous aesthetics – thin, solid, elegant, with killer sound – a real home run!Where will I put it?That’s always one of the big concerns with any music or home theater system – if it sounds great, then it usually involves multiple speakers and wires and connections. Where are you going to put any of this without having your living room look like a mixing studio? Even something as simple as a Playbar takes up space and can be hard to fit into your environment. What’s even better, is that since you already have a TV in your living room, Playbase sits right underneath the space already being used for your TV! It is as if it doesn’t take up any space at all.So simple, easy, fun and satisfyingYou literally unpack Playbase, lift up your TV and slide Playbase underneath, plug in the power cord, plug in the optical cable to your TV, download the app, setup the Playbase with a single button press, and you are off to the races! I really think almost anybody could do it.Amazing sound – for music or videoWhat is really impressive is that Playbase sounds as good with music as it does with video. So we all know the benefits of Sonos – access to all the streaming music services you want, or your own music library, with the ability to group as many Sonos players as you want to build a great multi-room music system. Now add killer Home Theater sound to that equation, with a design that really doesn’t take up any extra space in your living room. Suddenly your room is alive with fantastic sound, and you hardly notice where it is all coming from. This is really exciting!How about that bass?How could anything this thin have so much bass? I mean really – it sounds like you have a subwoofer playing, but all there is, is a Playbase that is about 2” thick! When you look at this elegant, sleek, thin work-of-art, and then you hear the sound output, it is a truly incredible experience. Besides, it is so proportioned, it really just looks like it is some kind of nicely designed TV stand – my family can’t believe that all the sound they hear is coming from the Playbase.Constructive criticism$699 is a fair amount of money, but I feel it is worth it since the benefit is so substantial. I really am impressed with the simple, elegant design that almost disappears in my living room, but provides such a powerful sound experience with music or Home Theater. Still, I do wish it could have cost a little less.No HDMI input – only optical. My TV has an optical output, so no issue here. I suppose there are some TV’s that don’t have optical, so you should just check to make sure. After experiencing the Playbase, I would have actually bought a new TV that has optical, if my TV didn’t have one. Not everybody wants to or can afford to do that, so just check before you buy.A full 5.1 surround sound experience? Not really, especially when comparing to a system with rear surround sound speakers. The clarity of sound is very good, especially vocals and dialogue. Front surround sounds effects are also very good. Playbase has a very wide soundstage that is genuinely immersive. The low-end bass is extremely potent for small to medium sized rooms, to a moderately loud volume. If you have a huge room, or want to wake up your neighbors, you will need more than Playbase can deliver. But here is the good news: you are buying into a modular and expandable system. Playbase can accept two Sonos Play:1 speakers that can be added wirelessly as surround speakers (you just need and outlet to plug them into). And for the really huge rooms, you can bond Playbase with the Sonos Sub, for a truly over-the-top experience. The reality is for me, Playbase is actually too loud for my small-to-mid-size room. It is only on the weekends, during the day, that I am able to crank it all the way up without bothering the neighbors.ConclusionsPlaybase is what the world has been waiting for – cutting edge design, that is clean and simple + room-filing sound that impresses with music or video content, in a thin package that slips right under your TV! It seems so obvious, but I suppose it has not really been possible until now – the technology or innovation just wasn’t there to make all of this happen. Yes, it is a little on the expensive side, but the quality and experience are both top notch. Sonos favors simplicity, with only 1 optical connection, so if you a techy gadget person who is looking for all the “bells and whistles”, you won’t find them with Playbase. What you will find is a truly great performing all-in-one system that blends in perfectly to your living space. You will find yourself listening to more music than before and enjoying your TV-time more than you thought possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Super easy to set up and fantastic sound. We set up as a standalone unit first to test whether we&rsquo;d need to add the subwoofer or additional speakers for full surround effects. Through a few days of use, we don&rsquo;t think it will be necessary to spend the additional money. We&rsquo;re not sound perfectionists so if you care about the deep bass of the helicopters in Apocalypse Now perhaps you&rsquo;d prefer to add Sonos&rsquo; subwoofer.</p>

<p>crisp sound, powerful bass for its size, fit under my 55 in tv perfectly, and lastly&hellip; very easy to set up. quite pricey though.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-sound-bar-base">Excellent sound-bar(base)!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Playbase because I wanted better sound when I watch TV. The setup was super fast and easy. The Sonos app(iPhone) made it easy to add and calibrate the Playbase to the room. To my surprise, one of the last steps in setting it up was to use my tv remote to press the volume button and the Playbase was configured for it. I can control the volume up, down, and mute from my TV remote, and the app. The sound performance is a huge improvement over the TV speakers. I can hear little details now and the bass is fantastic. Next I will probably add the sub for some extra kick! Great job Sonos!!!</p>
