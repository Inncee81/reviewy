<h5 id="the-guitar-arrived-in-perfect-shape-straight-neck">The guitar arrived in perfect shape, straight neck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The guitar arrived in perfect shape, straight neck, no dings or scratches. The feel of his Fender Acoustic/Electric is similar to my Fender electric guitars. It has a nice thin neck that is a little wider at the nut than an electric. All of the electronics and Fishman pickups work great. The sound is a nice full acoustic but is a little on the bright side. I think the sound will improve once I take the factory strings off and replace them with a set of Elixir&rsquo;s. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. It&rsquo;s a great Fender guitar that didn&rsquo;t break the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-california-vibe">Great California vibe!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all&hellip; As we all know for whatever reason Fender does not have the greatest of reputations when it comes to acoustic guitars. That may be true for some, but not all. Secondly, one either loves or hates the &ldquo;Strat&rdquo; headstock of the California Series. I happen to be in the camp of the &ldquo;love it&rdquo;. I believe (like most) guitars built in China, consistency in quality can be spotty&hellip; And Fender certainly fits that category. Having said that, I was one of the lucky ones receiving a Sonoran that was done right. Set up nicely right out of the box. And&hellip; it looks very cool. But most of all, it sounds really nice. Deep full sound that can also be bright when desired. I&rsquo;ll admit, I get wrapped up in the history and the California vibe of the Sonoran series. Perhaps not to the point where I would purchase one in Surf Green, bet hey&hellip; to each their own. Although, if I had a little money to throw around&hellip; I would also have a Surf Green model just for show! Anyway&hellip; In my humble opinion, and my years of experience I feel the Sonoran is a great value. If you like the looks&hellip; go for it! Oh and one more thing&hellip; If you do go for it, you&rsquo;ll need a case. I looked everywhere for recommendations and was very hard to find. The best (and most reasonably priced) case for this guitar is &ldquo;Musicians Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case. Fits perfect and is a solid case&hellip; That won&rsquo;t break the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-welcome-addition-to-the-quiver">A welcome addition to the quiver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shopped thru Amazon Warehouse &ldquo;open box&rdquo; inventory in an attempt to score a bargain. The first one I received was damaged, so back it went. Waited awhile, then a red one came available at a good price. Took a chance and ordered it. This one arrived well packaged in mint condition. The flawless Candy Apple Red finish is a deep, transparent, metallic hue which is just gorgeous. The Strato headstock gives it a unique, quirky look that I like. The neck is comfortable and frets are well finished. Intonation was spot-on out of the box. Nice action, no buzzes. The body is built sturdy and dense, and does not seem very resonant. Nevertheless the sound is pleasing and well balanced. It was a bit treble-y at first, so I changed the strings to Martin Retro .11-.52 , which brought out some more mid-range tones. Might next try heavier strings to get more volume from the beefy soundbox. The Fishman pickup/preamp is solid and adequate. This is an inexpensive, mass produced instrument&hellip;but it sounds good and it is fun to play and looks cool. It&rsquo;s like finding a superb $6 bottle of wine. Well pleased.</p>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-this-guitar">I absolutely love this guitar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this guitar.To begin with, I was caught between getting this guitar or the Fender CD-60 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar. I am thrilled that I spent the additional $100 for this guitar. Not only is this guitar eye-opening because of its downright beauty and stunning detail, but the main kicker is the warm resonate sound that is emitted from its glorious self.On top of that, the built in tuner is a plus. Much better than I anticipated, in regards to how the layout/setup is constructed.Lastly, the semi-electric option is a no brainer in my mind. The placement of the input jack is exactly where I like having them in semi-acoustic guitars.Kudos to the Fender Sonoran SCE!</p>

<h5 id="love-at-first-play">Love at first play</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can add much that the other positive reviews have already said other than everything they wrote is absolutely true. This was love at first play. I&rsquo;ve never purchased an instrument that I&rsquo;ve not played first and I hope that my experience is always this great.Some folks stated that this is a good beginner instrument but I&rsquo;ve been playing for over 40 years and I can tell you this is a great instrument no matter where you are in your experience as a musician.Love the built-in tuner.Love that the intonation is perfect - a sign of a quality instrument.Love the fingering.As soon as I got it out of the packaging, I tuned it up and played none stop for hours grinning like a big kid.The guitar is very beautiful. I&rsquo;m loving all of the pearl inlays and the beautiful surf green paint. The instrument has the famous Fender fingerboard which if you&rsquo;ve ever played a Fender, you know how smooth and clean the action is on their fingerboard.I also can&rsquo;t believe this is made in China. Yes its a mass produced guitar but the quality is maintained.The sound in my opinion is amazing and clean. Some folks mentioned they think it&rsquo;s a little bright but that is to my liking. If I wanted a deep sound, I would have been looking at an acoustic Martin but this is exactly what I would expect for a electric acoustic.If you are looking for a beginner instrument, I would say this is a top-of-the line beginner guitar. Heck my beginner guitar was a Sears electric guitar I bought over 35 years ago. (That thing is long gone.)Then I plugged it into my little Marsh practice amp. The sound through the amp was just a nice as the sound without the amp.I need to disclose that this is the first guitar I&rsquo;ve purchased in 30 years. The last instruments I purchased were a Gibson Les Paul Custom Deluxe back in 1986 and an electric acoustic Ovation (round back) in 1989. Both of those were brand new purchases. So I&rsquo;ve missed all of the fun new things they&rsquo;re doing with guitars since then like the built-in tuner.So maybe my enthusiasm is due to it being so long since I&rsquo;ve played something new. But you know, this is how you should feel when you get a new guitar regardless if its a top-of-the-line or not. I hope you enjoy it as much as I am enjoying this great instrument.</p>
