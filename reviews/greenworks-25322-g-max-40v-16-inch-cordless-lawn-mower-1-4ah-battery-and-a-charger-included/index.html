<blockquote>
<p>Six star amazing!Ordered yesterday: received today.I&rsquo;m a 66 year-old male. I&rsquo;ve been in a power wheelchair for 10 years from a severe case of Guillain-Barre syndrome that left me with a 45% total body disability rating. The GBS left me with about 50% of normal grip strength bilaterally and nerve damage and loss of strength in my forearms as well.A neighborhood teen has been mowing my yard for years using his lawn tractor.Just yesterday, a landscaping crew finished installing 150 feet of sidewalk across my front lawn and down the sides of my house. The walk is made from a combination of a pea gravel bed between staked, treated 2 X 4&rsquo;s and over 500 12 X 12 concrete step stones form Lowes. Red and white checkerboard pattern. I can now do yard work and not track in dirt on my wheelchair wheels.Well, it occurred to me that I would not want my yard boy riding the lawn tractor over my walkways so, after researching all the options, I bought this mower for HIM to use.Well, when it arrived this morning, I cut the box open to get to the charger and batteries so that I could have them ready for him.When the larger battery charged fully in about thirty minutes, I thought I would see how powerful the mower was with a brief test push.To my UTTER ASTONISHMENT and PURE DELIGHT, I was not only able give it a &ldquo;test push,&rdquo; but, steering my power wheelchair with my right hand on the joystick and the mower with my weakened left hand and arm, I was able to mow my entire front lawn! The mower is TRULY that light and maneuverable! I&rsquo;ll get the back yard tomorrow - and not because the battery gave out but because my out-of-shape arm did. I have a 1,517 square foot house on a 5,00 square foot lot, by the way.When I removed the large battery immediately after mowing, I returned it straight to the charger. Not only was it not too hot be recharged, it was barely warm after mowing in 91 degree southeast Georgia summer heat. It was fully recharged in 30 minutes.It made less noise than my bathroom fan or rangehood fan and had plenty of power for my overdue centipede lawn gone to seed.For the wheelchair bound who have retained full upper body nerve function and strength this thing will be a snap - including the 20 inch model. I&rsquo;m handling my 19 inch model with ease. For wheelchair bound users with even less strength than me, there is the 16 inch model.I can get by with the handle as is but I will be looking to modify the handle slightly to better suit my needs from the seated position in the wheelchair.NOTE TO GREENWORKS: I represent a tremendous market among the disabled for this mower. PLEASE consider making an optional handle configuration that is ergonomically right for thousands of potential users in power wheelchairs.By the way, no longer needing my lawn boy, I will easily recoup the cost of this mower in one full growing season.This thing represents a whole new ball game in cordless mowing and a near miracle for the wheelchair bound. SO FAR, I highly recommend it.Jay MorenoSt. Marys, GA3/16/2016I just mowed my lawn first time of the season. The mower is still going strong with no problems whatsoever.</p>

<h5 id="what-a-great-company">What a great company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this lawn mower some time back and it is always been a great mower. But, all good things come to an end and my lawnmower quit working but I found it was still in the warranty. So I called the company and they told me where to take my mower to have it repaired, which I did. However, in my case the mower could not be repaired so they shipped me a new one at no cost. What a great company!When I took my mower to the company for repair I also had to take my batteries with with me. So Greenworks informed me that I was going to be receiving a new mower they told me to go back to the repair company and pick up my batteries. After I got my batteries back I quickly realized that they had not given me back the same batteries that I&rsquo;d left with them. One of the batteries was no good. So I called GreenWorks and told them about the battery switch. So what if they do, Greenworks sent me a new battery, no charge. Great product great customer service thank you Greenworks.</p>

<p>I purchased this product because I didn&rsquo;t want to fuss with gasoline, oil and everything that goes with typical gas powered lawn mowers. I hate yard work - immensely. The last thing I want is to be out there any more than I have to with a malfunctioning or faulty piece of equipment. I also hate spending a fortune on someone else cutting my lawn so I purchased a full set of GreenWorks lawn equipment on Amazon.The results have been spectacular! In addition to hating yard work and being lazy, I am also rough on equipment. I&rsquo;ll give a human TLC but I expect to throw machinery at anything and watch it muscle through. If you look at the pictures attached you will see some of what I put my lawn mower through. The grass was up to the knees! Keep in mind that you can&rsquo;t just power through in a straight line. You have to be sophisticated at work it a little with the bag on but it will chomp it all down just the same.So, if your lawn looks normal and just needs a little off the top then this mower will run with the best. Light, easy to handle and lasts a good while on a charge (I bought multiple equipment so I ended up with 3 batteries). If you are like me then this will also get the job done but know that the more you ask of it the faster the battery will drain trying to accomplish the task. On a standard size lot once I get the grass short (again!) I can hedge trim; weed eat the entire perimeter, driveway and walkway; mow front and back; and blow all hard surfaces on three fully charged batteries in 45 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This model delivers on value versus the other GreenWorks mowers in my opinion because of the two included batteries 1 4Ah and 1 2Ah where the others offer two 2Ah or one 4Ah. I believe the single 19 inch blade provides better cutting power than the other models with 2 smaller blades. I am very impressed with how quiet this thing is. The first thing I noticed while mowing is that the mower automatically senses the amount of power needed depending on the thickness or toughness of the grass being mowed; you can hear the motor speed up or slow down as needed and I am fairly certain this adds a lot to how long the battery will last. I have an average city size lot and have never come close to using a full battery. I purchased the blower without the battery because the two included batteries with mower get the job done. The deck height is easily adjusted but some people that have a well established very thick St. Augustine yard might not get enough height but this was not an issue for me. I wanted a mower that doesn&rsquo;t use gas and has no issues with start up and this certainly meets the criteria (start up couldn&rsquo;t be easier). I plan to buy some of the other tools minus the battery because they are inexpensive ($49 for a 12 inch chain saw).</p>
