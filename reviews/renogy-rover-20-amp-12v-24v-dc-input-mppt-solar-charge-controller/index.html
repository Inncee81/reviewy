<h5 id="and-the-incredibly-bad-thought-they-did-by-potting-the-capacitors">and the incredibly bad thought they did by potting the capacitors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This appears to be the same china no name Tracers with a Renogy logo on it.I gave this unit 4 stars due to the missing screws on the pcb (only 1 of 4 had the screws in it), the sever lack of serviceability on the 3 fuses, and capacitors, and the incredibly bad thought they did by potting the capacitors. This is the worse thing I have seen done! If there is a failure, the top can not vent through the safety release, and the walls can not expand. If it gets to rupture pressure, it will explode and destroy the board!! This is not from Renogy, this was done by the manufacture. If you use this correctly and had good batch of capacitors this should not be an issue. PWM does stress capacitors. I was not able to get ratings off of them to see if they oversize them to compensate for this.Other than those issues.. I do like this unit. The surface area for cooling looks very well. Inspection of the surface mount components looks to be of good quality. I did not find any cracked or still having the beads in the joints. The board has a nice even conformal coating which will make this board have much longer lifespan. The transistors have full electrical isolation from the shell, very nice touch. The mounts on them are isolated as well and have a locking material on the heads to prevent them from backing out.Another thing I really like was the negative buss bar to all 3 ground terminals. It is very thick and tall. This bar will handle 40 amps with no problem all day long. This also allows me to use any ground point at any time. In the pictures it appears if the wire was to tall it would short positive to negative, this is not the case.. With the case on, it has a built in plastic bar that goes right down to the board to prevent this from happening.The MPPT is very fast and precise on this unit. Having 2 c.c. power supplies I watched it hunt. It was very fast in finding the max current and voltage. It also kept searching after locked. The search was very small deviations and did not affect its performance. When a 3rd c.c. power source was attached it found the MPPT point and locked quick and kept searching. This units MPPT is the fastest and most accurate I have seen. The small deviations for search after lock appears to be +/- .3V - */-.25AI did get the head unit for this, so I can not advise on how hard it is to program though the case buttons.Remember&hellip; This is 40 amps max not a 1000 watt max, with 12 volt system it is good for 500 watts, with 24 its 1000 watts. The manual recommends 800 watts max solar though.</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-great-product">Absolutely great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this controller because I wanted an MPPT device that I could expand my system on. Being 40 amps, I have plenty of room to grow. Installation was a breeze and the manual answered any questions I had such as setting the Work Mode level to 17 so I could just turn on or off the load at my choosing. I can&rsquo;t believe someone would criticize this item for being big and heavy. Good grief, being 40 amps and MPPT requires substantial electronics to function properly and I for one was pleased at the substantial heft and build quality. In fact, my system is built on Renogy panels as well and I am relieved to see this level of build quality in all their products I have acquired. You can&rsquo;t go wrong purchasing this charge controller.</p>

<h5 id="good-mppt-charge-controller-and-a-really-good-rf-hash-developer">Good MPPT Charge controller and a really good RF hash developer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great MPPT charge controller, However it does put out a lot of RF hash. If you&rsquo;re an Amateur Radio Operator or a shortwave listener avoid this unit. I tryed type 31 ferrites on all the inputs and outputs with no luck. The heat sink is the problem, Pulse width modulation artifacts From 1 MHz through 10 MHz. Asked Renogy tech support about this, their answer was we do not test these for RF EMI radiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="working-great-for-me">Working great for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using this with 4 105 watt panels. It is working great. Plan to add two more panels. and up the fuse to 40 amps. It should handles this with no problems. I may add a fan to it, in case it needs more heat dissipation. So far it seems to be loafing with 15-20 amp loads. My panels are wired in pairs. Two panels in series for 36 V open circuit and the other are in parallel in this configuration. Higher voltage and less current on my 10 gauge wire. Service out is at 12 Volts so the higher 6 ga wire makes sense.Pro&rsquo;s:Gel Cell biasing option for charging&ndash;Works well, controls both current and voltage very well. Works with AGM and Flooded also.Remote Panel (optional) has some use but a better choice is a LinkPro battery monitor.Compact, and has mounting flanges for vertical mounting.Cons:Wire terminals suck. Be sure to use ferrules crimped to the ends of your wire, or else solder them. The clamps will damage the wire. I used 10 ga wire from my panels, with soldered tips to terminate and upgraded the wire to 6 gauge, to connect to the battery, mostly so I could terminate them better.</p>

<h5 id="tracer-4210-40-amp-mppt-charge-controller-12-24v">Tracer 4210 40 Amp MPPT Charge Controller 12/24V</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to upgrade from the Tracer 10 Amp controller. I am running 500 watts solar power into it. The panels are wired series/parallel for 40 volls into the contoller. The contoller is putting out an easy 10 amps D.C. into the batteries supporting my inverter which is supporting 130 watts A.C. for my computer room daily. The battery voltage is 13.1 to 13.5 during peak sun while supporting the load daily. Wish I had bought the 40 amp controller to beging with. So far so good.Update: I now have 6 - 100 watt panels and 2 - 50 watt panels wired series / parallel for a total of 700 watts to the controller. It is handling it just fine. As you can see the panels are doing an easy load of running a 110 watt load on my inverter at only 14 amps of solar power.</p>

<h5 id="glad-i-did">GLAD I DID</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to do an install in a Mercedes Sprinter Pleasureway RV. After spending a ton of time doing my research I made the decision to go with Renogy. GLAD I DID! They are a professional company with very good customer care. I went ahead with the purchase of this as well as the 150 watt Renogy panel. The install was as smooth as could be expected. I located the controller in the driver side rear wheel well compartment. Ran the cables and installed the panel. Just for monitoring sake I added the MT5 monitor. I now have a real time reading of what&rsquo;s going on. I can say this about the entire setup - I have just returned from a week long trip with 3 days being completely &ldquo;dry.&rdquo; Ran all the lights, refer, pump, cell chargers, cooling fan on the fridge (it was about 97 degrees so it ran a BUNCH), and did not go into a &ldquo;conserve&rdquo; mode for our DC system. The house battery never came off from being 100% full. Total peace of mind! Planning a week long &ldquo;dry&rdquo; camping trip in a couple of weeks. Thrilled with the set up and results.</p>
