<h5 id="great-3d-restoration-but-horrible-storyline-and-plot-boring">Great 3D restoration but horrible storyline and plot&hellip;.boring!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 3D is great and I&rsquo;ve wanted to see this movie in 3D for years, although in 2D I could care less. Well, it&rsquo;s pretty boring&hellip;..we sat until the intermission and haven&rsquo;t gone back to finish it. I thought it might at least have some camp value, but not so much. I have sat through a lot of bad 3D movies (Jaws 3D, The Bubble, September Storm, etc.) but this is the first one I couldn&rsquo;t even get through! Usually the 3D keeps me interested but not this time!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall 3D Presentation Rating: 43D Separation: 53D In Yo&rsquo; Face Factor: 2&rdquo;You Can&rsquo;t Trust A Blonde.&ldquo;During the early 50s television was having a huge impact upon American audiences who chose to stay at home for their entertainment rather than going out. Theaters had to find a new way of bringing people back into the theater. For the moment, 3D seemed to be the answer. Mostly between the years, 1952-55 studios put considerable effort into supporting the short-lived 3D boom.Among the many titles being released during that period, Those Redheads From Seattle boasts the distinction of being the first 3D musical ever produced and the first widescreen production from Paramount Studios. If you would like to learn more interesting history about this release, I invite you to read this article from 3-D Film Archive.A mother (Agnes Moorehead) and her four daughters travel from Cleveland to Alaska to meet their father in the Yukon. They arrive only to find that he has been killed. They soon get involved with a saloon owner named Johnny Kisco (Gene Barry) who may very well be the man responsible for the killing.The film itself has a little of everything for everyone: murder, a western setting, a little romance, and many opportunities to present leg-kicking musical numbers. In all, it&rsquo;s mildly entertaining light-hearted fare accented with excellent 3D separation.The transfer itself is a mixed bag with inconsistent levels of quality. I say that with a bit of hesitation because one really needs to understand the amount of work that went into restoring this film and how the transfer looked before Greg Kintz and his team were able to touch it. I&rsquo;ll talk more about all of that in a few moments.To watch this presentation without knowing its background, one might be dumbfounded by the ever-changing condition of its presentation. Some scenes look severely faded. Others have that breathtaking quality you would expect from a Technicolor production. It isn&rsquo;t until you delve into the supplements that you realize how piss-poor Those Redheads From Seattle looked when the 3-D Film Archive got their hands on it. Only then can you really appreciate the level of restoration that has been done for this Blu-ray release.Cinematographer Lionel Linden has done an excellent job staging his shots with proper prop placement. Nearly every scene provides a superior level of depth layered with objects that give proper foreground and background distinction. Some of the best scenes take place in the Klondike Club where even the smallest effects such as cigar smoke take on a character of their own when layered between the action on screen. This isn&rsquo;t a film for pop-out enthusiasts. Director Lewis R. Foster doesn&rsquo;t rely on much gimmickry to tell his story. There are a few moments where objects protrude slightly forward. These include: Teresa Brewer popping her head out from a curtain, a dancing line of kicking legs, and a leaky barrel spouting streams of beer. The title credits perhaps have the best use of pop-out, extending the furthest outwards towards the viewer.More pronounced than the 3D presentation itself is the film&rsquo;s soundtrack. 3-D Film Archive restorationist Bob Furmanek searched globally for film&rsquo;s original 3-channel magnetic soundtrack. Alas, it was never found. However, sound specialist Eckhard Büttner performed a spectral extraction to restore the original sound elements, the result of which provides for an amazing auditory experience. The left, right, and main channels do an amazing job of creating specific sonic placement. As actors move across the viewing area, the sound moves with them. As someone sitting dead center in the listening area, it&rsquo;s an astonishing experience &ndash; certainly a cut above standard stereo separation. For those that prefer, the original mono soundtrack is included in lossless audio.Normally I don&rsquo;t have the time to spend with supplemental material or to cover it in my reviews. In this case, however, I highly recommend you take a moment to look at two specific additions to this Blu-ray disc&hellip;.A Restoration Demo by Greg Kintz is an absolute must watch to really appreciate the transfer of Those Redheads From Seattle. It&rsquo;s only a few short minutes in length, but Greg shows us how bad the print looked when they took ownership of it. Dust, dirt and built-in grime had to be painstakingly removed. Shakes, frame jumps, and vertical alignment issues had to be corrected. With side-by-side examples of &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after,&rdquo; one gets a very clear impression of the massive work that needed to be done. Of course, with a limited budget and time frame that was allotted, one must consider that this was the absolute best job that could have been done under those circumstances.Audio/Video Demo of the 3-channel sound reconstruction presents us with a scene from the film&rsquo;s most rousing musical number, &ldquo;Chica-Boom.&rdquo; Overhead sound meters above the film&rsquo;s frame shows specific sound placement.There is a 2006 interview with Rhonda Fleming. The film&rsquo;s original theatrical trailer is also included. Lastly, but not least, is a running audio commentary from Bob Furmanek, Greg Kintz, Jack Theaston and Hillary Hess. As I am always limited on time to get these reviews done as soon as possible, I only had the opportunity to listen to a few short minutes of the commentary. The discussion was quite lively and informative. You can be assured that with these renowned film historians at the helm, you are going get quite a bit of insight into the aspects of the 3D production including the various effect tricks that were used.As with all Kino 3D releases, a 2D presentation is also included on the disc.CONCLUSIONIn an era filled with top-rated and poorly produced 3D fare, Those Redheads From Seattle rises the occasion of being more entertaining than most. This beautifully restored Blu-ray is certainly worth your purchase consideration.The team from the 3-D Film Archive, with limited budget and time, have done a remarkable job with a print that was originally plagued with problems. I am really thankful that, through their efforts, there is a continued stream of these rarities being brought to Blu-ray.(originally reviewed on hometheaterforum)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those Redheads from Seattle Blu Ray 3D: 1 hour 30 minutes of a Classic Musical Film set in a town in the cold Northwest US. Nice musical numbers and singing, dancing and an entertaining story that takes place indoors, in the town streets, and in some spots, outdoors in the cold countryside for a nice variety of scenery and 3D.3D Review:Strong 3D layering that looks amazing in 3D. This movie made sure to make almost every shot be filled with 3D layers of objects, people and scenery. Further distance scenery naturally minimizes the 3D effect to medium layering or mild as would be seen in nature, where farther scenery flattens out to the human eyes. The medium range camera shots where we see the full human from head to shoe, of which the film mainly consists, have strong 3D. Very important.The characters and objects often have a nice 3D roundness to them in most shots.Again, not only is almost every shot filled with interesting 3D objects, but the framing of each shot is expertly crafted, with 3D compositions that balance out the 3D objects very well within frame, so people&rsquo;s heads are not cropped off but within frame.3D Pop Out Count: This film didn&rsquo;t have the main goal of pop outs, so they are minimal in most cases, with the exception of some good 3D pop outs of hats, a beer barrel fountain, and a few other instances, including a newspaper press.With what is possible, Greg Kintz and the 3-D Film Archives Team have restored this film to its best presentation, considering the original material was degraded from years of slow decay. Vibrant colors, mostly sharp visuals and very comfortable alignment of the 3D frames so they coordinate well together for a great 3D experience.While I would have liked to have seen more 3D pop outs, the 3D layering in this film is amazing and when sitting at a comfortable distance, nearly transports the viewer into the scene.One of my favorite 3D shots in the film takes place at 47 minutes, 23 seconds or so, when 5 people, including the women in the blue dresses, walking from outside, into the windowed printing press storefront, where newspapers are printed. The shot is in very strong 3D and is layered perfectly with books on a table in the foreground, press machines midground, the people layered behind, the store with the window behind them, and through the window, the town stores across the street. Amazing 3D shot.The 3D commentary including 3-D Film Archives&rsquo; Bob Furmanek, Greg Kintz and Jack Theakston was very informative and educational, along with Hillary Hess contributing as well. They covered the history of 3D cinema and the 3D theatrical drought and the reasons relating to poor projection as the primary cause of the lack of 3D offerings in 1954. Plus Greg&rsquo;s details on how he restored the film were greatly explained. Very glad to have 3-D Film Archives speaking throughout the entire film and I wish this would happen with all their future releases for the 3D commentary track.Very much enjoyed the outstanding, strong stereo 3D in Those Redheads From Seattle on Blu Ray 3D and recommend it to any stereo 3D fan of the history of 3D cinema and strong 3D examples. Thanks very much to 3-D Film Archives, Kino Lorber for this great, affordable 3D presentation of film history restored and preserved.</p>
