<h5 id="loved-it">Loved it!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cabana is amazing!! We just got back from a week on the beach and we used this nonstop! While everyone else was renting chairs and cabanas for $30 a day we had this great pop up cabana and loved it! We took it on the plane no problem, it is super easy to set up and take down. My 11 yr old daughter could do it in 30 seconds even when windy. Perfect product! The stakes held nicely in the sand but we ended up bending them. They still work fine even bent. It was like our little home base on the beach. I also bought inflatable wedge chairs on Amazon (clear, 2 for $15) that worked great and picked up some other cheap beach chairs. Perfect!</p>

<h5 id="easy-set-up-and-folds-up-just-as-easy-for-storage-my-grandsons-thinks-this-is-his-playhouse">Easy set up and folds up just as easy for storage. My grandsons thinks this is his playhouse.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The shade tent arrives neatly folded in a carry bag. When you open the bag and pull the tent out you can literally pull the tent out and throw it in the air and it will pop into place! I love that! No poles or stakes or directions to follow, this is like one of those children&rsquo;s play tent and tunnels. It arrives with a set of stakes if you happen to use this on a windy day outside so it doesn&rsquo;t blow away, but so far we haven&rsquo;t found the need to use them. My grandson and my dog and son&rsquo;s dog likes to crawl around and play inside of the sun tent indoors like it&rsquo;s their own little play house. There is a screen that runs along the side so he can see what&rsquo;s going on from all angles. The front is completely open so if you wanted to hang a small blanket like a little door, which we have done, this then becomes a child&rsquo;s clubhouse. There are directions inside of the bag to help you know which way this folds up. It folds up almost as easily as it sets up and fits right back into the bag. I have provided a video to show how easy this is done.I did receive this as a promo sample to test and share my honest and fair opinion. All opinions are my own whether positive or negative and are not influenced by this promotion and no guarantee of a positive review was given Other experiences may vary.</p>

<h5 id="on-amazon-and-shows-this-tent-and-are-so-glad-that-we-did">&hellip; on Amazon and shows this tent and are so glad that we did</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We took a chance after lots of research on Amazon and shows this tent and are so glad that we did. As a group of four people we brought this to Sunny Siesta Key Beach today and it worked like a charm. May I suggest the portable rechargeable mini fan because it can get very stuffy in the tent even with the mesh air vents. Anyhow we found it easy with the automatic pop up and relatively easy to contort back to its case. Needless to say there were no sunburns and this seems to be a great product that we will buy another one soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-match-for-the-wind">No match for the wind</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We set this up on the beach without stakes and filled the side pockets with as much wet sand as they will hold. It kept collapsing with everything the wind blew. I updated this rating from 2 to 3 stars as the company is very persistent with following up, offering half refund as well as shipping a newer version (declined both for the time being). Another family set up a very similar tent right next to us using stakes and their tent was not collapsing so perhaps with stakes, this would have done better, but not certain without having tried.</p>

<h5 id="great-customer-service-not-as-impressed-with-the-product">Great customer service, not as impressed with the product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually writing this review from the parking lot of the beach after wrestling this thing back into its bag an calling it quits for the day&hellip;This tent/canopy worked great the first few times I tried it&ndash;in my living room. Folding it up again was the first obstacle I ran into. Even going online and looking up the video didn&rsquo;t seem to explain much. The thing only folds up through the use of sheer willpower and harsh curse words.Took it to the beach for the first time this afternoon. It opened up quickly but without the help of at least one other person or a bag of bricks, this will basically blow away as you are trying desperately to push the tent poles into place.Oh, and those &ldquo;tent poles&rdquo;? Good luck. You may as well be using toothpicks&hellip;.This tent is maaaaybe suitable for some extra shade while watching the kids play in the yard on a sunny <em>breezeless</em> day&hellip; or maybe if you want it inside&hellip;. for some reason.Definitely NOT good for the beach, especially if you&rsquo;re flying solo. I really wanted this to work out, now I&rsquo;m just frustrated that I actually paid money for this.EDIT: After posting this review the company got back to me super quickly and offered me a partial refund while allowing me to keep the tent. They&rsquo;re customer service is great, hopefully I&rsquo;ll get the hang of the tent soon&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="i-recommend-just-buying-a-more-expensive-one-that-has-structural">I recommend just buying a more expensive one that has structural &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2 times we use it at tybee island we have to support the tent with chairs to keep it from falling over since the stakes didn&rsquo;t keep it grounded. The material was too weak that when there was wind the tent would cave in. I recommend just buying a more expensive one that has structural enforcement from metal bars (like the ones camping tents have). Folding it up took us a good minute to get but we figured it out. It is light weight and small which was the initial reason we wanted to get the tent since we would already be lugging too much stuff for our infant child.Update Aug 2016, since writing my initial review I have been contacted by the customer service representative. She was great at trying to make my experience better and sent a replacement tent therefore I changed my rating to 3 stars from 2 because of there multiple efforts to ensure I was a satisfied customer.</p>

<h5 id="the-folds-did-not-and-do-not-fold-like-it-s-supposed-to">The folds did not and do not fold like it&rsquo;s supposed to</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So, I purchased this a little over a year ago. We first used it in our garden while gardening so our toddler could play in it, she didn&rsquo;t. We took it to the beach and that&rsquo;s when the fumbling of trying to fold it back into the bag began. The folds did not and do not fold like it&rsquo;s supposed to. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, following the instructions on the tent did nothing. Wasted my money - did not use it enough for any return on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bummed-would-not-recommend">Bummed - would NOT recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tent is great, the first time you use it. Trying to fold it back up, it got completely bent out of shape and is ruined.</p>

<p>Great product. We enjoyed using this on the beach. Note: the cabana will start to buckle in a stiff breeze if you face the rear of the cabana against the wind.</p>
