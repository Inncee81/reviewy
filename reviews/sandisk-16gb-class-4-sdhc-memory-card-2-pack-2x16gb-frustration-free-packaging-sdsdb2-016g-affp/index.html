<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-a-point-and-shoot-not-so-great-for-dslrs">Great for a point and shoot, not so great for DSLRs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The quality of this card is relative to how you plan on using it. I bought it last year to use in my point and shoot digital camera (12MP) while on vacation and it worked perfectly. No, a year later, I&rsquo;ve bought a DSLR and found it just wasn&rsquo;t up to snuff. My DSLR (26MP) creates files of too large a size for this card to quickly save. Want to take one picture? Fine, but be prepared to wait 20+ seconds for it to be fully saved onto the card, during which time you will be unable to take any other photos. Want to shoot in burst mode? Forget about it; it&rsquo;s not going to work.What I had been unaware of when I first bought this card is that memory cards have speed ratings which indicate how quickly they can process the data you want to write on them. To further complicate things, there are two types of ratings, Speed Class and Ultra High Speed. Speed classes come in four ratings, C2, C4, C6, and C10, which means they can write data at a rate of 2MB/s, 4MB/s, 6MB/s, and 10MB/s, respectively, or UHS comes in UHS U1 and U3, which writes at speeds of 10MB/s and 30MB/s. The higher the MB/s, the better the card.This card writes at a C4 speed (as indicated by the number 4 encircled by a C on the label). It&rsquo;s a decent speed for smaller files, but considering a RAW photo files can be rather large, if you&rsquo;re shooting high res, RAW files, this is not the card for you. It will absolutely freeze up your camera.If you are interested in an SD card for a DSLR, look at something like the Lexar Professional 600x 32GB SDHC UHS-I Flash Memory Card LSD32GCRBNA600. Since switching to the C10/U1 Lexar, I&rsquo;ve been infinitely more happy with my camera. The Sandisk C4 32GB remains in my point and shoot, where it&rsquo;s better suited.</p>

<h5 id="it-works-for-my-mac-air">It works for my Mac Air</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried a micro with adapter and that didn&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;m using it in my MacBook Air with solid state drive to increase my overall storage. I was able to move a lot of files here that were cluttering my Mac but I didn&rsquo;t want to necessarily delete them. My Mac just sees this as another drive and I can now put items on it that I may not need now but would like to hang on to if necessary. So, for that it works perfectly and writes fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">Good Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to accompany the ViewSonic VFD820-50 8-Inch Digital Photo Frame. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many photos it will hold because that depends on the size of each photo, all I can say is that I saved over 30 to it at about 200 KB and didn&rsquo;t run out of room. The price was great and the packaging was well protected and arrived quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-feel-like-these-cards-are-overpriced-for-this-day-in-age">I feel like these cards are overpriced for this day in age</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like these cards are overpriced for this day in age. San Disk cards are always a good buy when you need storage as they are quick and reliable, but since they have been out so long you would think they would have found a way to make them more affordable? I did not get the easy open package, but I did not have trouble opening the manufacture package. It tore open without scissors or any other help. I use mine in my laptop and computer i have had so many computers break it is nice to know my important photos and things are stored on a card like this.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-automatically">Works well automatically</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked right away for my All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet with Alexa, 8&rdquo; HD Display, 16 GB, Black - with Special Offers! Inserted, recognized, automatically select format, and bingo! All storage was automatically shifted to the card from main RAM, and my queued prime videos all downloaded automatically.</p>

<h5 id="a-perfectly-fine-memory-card-without-a-slot-to-use-it-in">A perfectly fine memory card without a slot to use it in&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This card was recommended for use with a Film to Digital Convert I purchased, and made the Converter freeze. Only because the Converter could not accept it. User Manual with Converter states such, but Amazon recommended this card to purchase with the converter. Now I have a perfectly fine memory card without a slot to use it in. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find a use for it someplace.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfectly-but-i-wouldn-t-buy-it">Works perfectly BUT I WOULDN&rsquo;T BUY IT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing wrong with this memory card but I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND IT!! Because&hellip; you can buy a micro SD card with that comes with an adapter for use as a standard SD card which means that you can use it in cameras that wont accept full sized cards. Sandisk makes a good product that you can rest assured will work, I have one from pre 2000 that still works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-chatted-directly-with-sandisk-and-they-verified-and-said-it-was-authentic">I chatted directly with SanDisk and they verified and said it was authentic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this directly from Amazon (not from a third party seller), and when I received it, the sticker was different than all my other SanDisk memory cards I own and have bought over the years from a physical store like Best Buy and Frys, and there weren&rsquo;t the usual printed numbers and whatnot on the actual plastic housing, so at first I thought maybe it was a counterfeit memory card. So I did what I knew best, I went directly to the SanDisk&rsquo;s website chat (I did not know they had this feature on their website, whaddaya know!), and they asked for my card number, sent the person I was chatting with a photo of the front and back of the memory card, and they had me waiting for a couple of minutes and they returned and verified that it was an authentic SanDisk memory card. Of course it works just perfectly and nothing is wrong with it, but it was good to know for sure that it was a legit card. The only thing that bugs the OCD side of me is that this SanDisk memory card looks different from all my other ones. But it was a great buy for a great price.</p>
