</ul>

<p>The WORX WG775 is a greener, quieter, cleaner and more convenient lawn mower. No gas, no oil, no smelly exhaust – and no cord. This 14-inch cordless mower features a powerful 24-volt battery capable of cutting up to 6,000 square feet of lawn on a single charge. Its compact, lightweight design makes it perfect for small or hard-to-maneuver yards. A simple push of a button gets you on your way, so no more pull strings. A battery power level indicator takes the guesswork out of knowing how much charge is remaining on the battery. The small compact battery is removable and has a carry handle so it can easily be charged in a separate location from the mower. This mower offers the flexibility of three different cutting options with three adjustable cut heights ranging from 2 to 3.5 inches. The mulching feature chops and distributes clippings evenly to help the lawn hold moisture and nutrients. The rear discharge allows clippings to be swept quickly from the cutting chamber. And the included grass-catching bag allows grass and leaves to be conveniently collected and removed via the bag’s oversized handle. There’s even an indicator valve that shows when the bag is completely full.</p>

<h5 id="i-call-him-squirt">I call him SQUIRT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little lawnmower has given me my life back! I can now mow my lawn with ease. It is actually FUN to do. I was paying $20 a week to have someone mow my lawn because my big gas powered machine hurt me. I have arthritis and have good and bad bone days. Even getting the lawnmower out of the garage was painful. I decided to buy a cordless, and did a lot of online research, watched videos, etc. Amazon offered a great deal on this little machine, so I decided to take a chance. I love this little guy. Piece of cake to put together! I even named him SQUIRT. He does an amazing job. I power off, sit and rest, hit the key and get back to work. I use the mulch mode, and it discharges from the back, so there is no mess to clean up after. I also don&rsquo;t have to use my weed whacker, because of the small size of this mower, I can get as close to the edge as possible, so nothing left to trim! Also, it is so quiet I mowed at 7:00 a.m. when my yard was completely shaded. My neighbors didn&rsquo;t even know! I couldn&rsquo;t be happier and would highly recommend this little gem for anyone who cannot handle pushing a regular gas powered lawn mower. My gas powered machine is self-propelled, but that doesn&rsquo;t help when you have to go backwards, which happens a lot in my yard. I love SQUIRT! Can&rsquo;t wait to use him again!</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-classic-bait-switch">Buyer Beware - Classic Bait &amp; Switch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems great, right? Be environmentally friendly and purchase a battery powered mower for only $200.00? Some things are too good to be true - this being one of them. And, don&rsquo;t be fooled by what looks like a four-star rating on this mower. At the time of this post, 18% of the reviews are one or two-stars and most of those reviews are because of the fact that the battery only lasts a year and a half if you&rsquo;re lucky.It&rsquo;s my fault though - I didn&rsquo;t spend enough time reading the reviews or paying attention to the number of bad reviews. And then, just like everyone else, my battery crapped-out approximately 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years after my purchase. And yes, I followed all the instructions regarding charging and storage of the battery.So, what happens when your battery dies just outside of the warranty window? Well, contact WORX and they will tell you (and I quote), &ldquo;Warranty coverage on all batteries is 1 year, this replacement is 89.99+13.25(s\h). I can offer a 10% discount as courtesy to you for being a valued customer.&rdquo; This brings the replacement cost to over $94.00 on a $200 mower. Seem a little off to you?But, what is most worrisome is that the battery started leaking water and the part where the plug connects to the battery actually burnt and melted. I&rsquo;m thankful that a fire wasn&rsquo;t started. I relayed all this information to WORX customer service when I contacted them to see if they could replace the battery, but they wouldn&rsquo;t comment on it and just apologized that they could&rsquo;t do anything more then to offer me a 10% discount since the battery was out of warranty.You can also check out the reviews on the replacement battery for this POS here: WORX WA3216 24-Volt Lead Acid Mower 5.0Ah Battery for Series WG775, WG782, WG783 Mowers Again, don&rsquo;t be fooled by the seemingly four-star review. A whopping 29% of the reviews on this battery are only one or two-stars. That&rsquo;s nearly 1 out of 3 people who give this battery a negative review.Save yourself a headache and $200+ dollars and avoid this mower (and company) at all costs.</p>

<h5 id="had-some-issues-but-worx-stood-behind-their-product-and-resolved">Had some issues, but WORX stood behind their product and resolved.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: I contacted Worx and explained my troubles and they took care of me and resolved everything. These days it&rsquo;s becoming more difficult to find a company that stands behind their products, but WORX appears to do so.A note about the batteries: yes, they are very expensive to purchase replacements. However, they can be rebuilt with new cells by anybody with strong electrical engineering knowledge for literally a fraction of the cost, and you have a brand new battery. I&rsquo;ve done this successfully and would be willing to do the same for anybody else that may need it. I am also considering experimenting with a lithium-ion conversion which would maintain a more stable voltage and keep the motor from &ldquo;Petering out&rdquo;.</p>

<h5 id="this-mower-works-fine-when-completely-charged">This mower works fine when completely charged</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery lasted me about 15 minutes after being fully charged. This mower works fine when completely charged, but it can&rsquo;t go through any grass that&rsquo;s moderately long, and the battery dying is a major drawback. Do not buy this thing if you have more than 5 ft. x 5 ft. to mow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-one-and-done-mower">This is a great one-and-done mower!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great when it actually works! The first season we got this, we had no complaints whatsoever! It did exactly what we needed it to do on our small front and back lawns. Pulled this mower out for season two and had battery problems and thought about getting a second battery as the first one had intermittent charges. Found out they cost more than $130 bucks! Geez! My car battery is cheaper than that and works better than that! I tried re-charging the battery once again and that time it did charge it fully but the charge did not last that long. Typically, a single charge will allow me to mow front and back lawns (20&rsquo; by 20&rsquo; back and 10&rsquo; by 10&rsquo; front) with no problems and have plenty of charge left over. This year, I have to charge it twice, once for the back lawn and once for the front lawn. Then one day, it just quit, the mower just quit. The battery was fine and showed it still has a charge but the mower just wouldn&rsquo;t start and couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint the problem&hellip; Called our local Worx-authorized repair facility and they had no answer for us. They wanted to charge us $100 bucks just to look at it and then charge us additional for parts and labor if they figure out what is wrong with it. The guy made it sound like these mowers are troublesome and not worth their time to fix it. In other words, this is a one-and-done mower: great for one season and you&rsquo;re done! I would not recommend this to anyone or would I buy it again. Heard that Worx customer service is non-existent so I decided not to bother with that. Find another battery-operated mower that actually works and the battery is cheap or go with a corded-electric mower that we bought for $80 bucks on craigslist that works every time!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this mower for a few months now and I love it. The only downside is that I have to empty the bag every 200ft or so. But it cuts my 2000sqft yard twice on a single charge.</p>

<p>Surprisingly light weight and pushes with ease. Battery is light, removes and inserts quickly.Make sure nuts for mower blade are tight.</p>
