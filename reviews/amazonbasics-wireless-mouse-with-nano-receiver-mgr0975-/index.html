<h5 id="spot-on-but-shorter-than-a-normal-mouse">Spot on, but shorter than a normal mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pro: This is a good wireless mouse. The USB receiver is small and fits inside the mouse when not in use. It takes 2 AAA batteries that angle in when installing (took me a sec to figure that out). My Dell laptop recognized it immediately and works identically to a wired mouse in every other way.Con: It is shorter than a normal mouse, which is going to take some getting used to. I wish it were the same size as a normal mouse, but this seems to be a trend with this wireless ones. I&rsquo;ve attached a pic.</p>

<h5 id="inexpensive-reliable-stable-and-easy-to-install">Inexpensive,Reliable, stable and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using Microsoft&rsquo;s basic optical USB wired mouse for years. Everytime I try something different I end up going back to MS mouse. The thumbwheel usually goes first in my experience.I have had this mouse for a month now. This mouse feels and performs exactly the same as the MS basic optical mouse. Pointer movement is accurate and scroll wheel feel/operation is very good. Button clicks are good. Not too hard or too soft. I have med-lg hands and never had a problem with this size mouse.Installation was plug and play with Windows 7. No drivers to install. Wireless operation has been flawless. The top of the mouse is rubberized synthetic that does absorb oil from your hand and fingers.. Easy to clean with windex though. I got the mouse on sale. I really like it. I will keep using it until stops working.. Oh. almost forgot it tracks well on my sofa as well. Considering sale price -$15 and smooth operation. 5 starsBatteries are easy to install. The +/- terminals are molded into body. Don&rsquo;t understand the complaints about difficult installation.Update 7/5/12 5th month: Still working perfectly. Batteries last one month if you don&rsquo;t turn it off.Update 1/25/2013 1 year still working fineUpdate 8/8/14 2.5 years and still working. I use it everyday.</p>

<h5 id="agile-and-just-right-size">Agile and Just-Right Size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this wireless mouse for use at work, and I&rsquo;m so impressed at the agility and ease of it. I feared that it would be too small (I read too many reviews, but hey&hellip;in the end I always make up my own mind), but it fits just perfectly in my hand. Having said that, I DO have small-ish hands.If you buy this product, please note that the receiver is in the base of the mouse &ndash; I nearly returned the mouse because I couldn&rsquo;t find the receiver. It&rsquo;s right there within the battery well. Also, the batteries (and they are included) go in at a weird angle, so you might have to fiddle with it for it register. When the red light on the back becomes solid, you know you&rsquo;ve got them in correctly. I haven&rsquo;t had any trouble with the &ldquo;Off/On&rdquo; switch. I use the mouse vigorously, and it stays securely &ldquo;On&rdquo; while I&rsquo;m using it, and turn it off (and put it in a drawer) when I go home at night. I&rsquo;m definitely impressed with AmazonBasics &ndash; bringing you quality at such a great value. I have a Logitech wireless mouse at home, and I dare say, this one is more agile than that one. I&rsquo;m considering buying another one to replace it!</p>

<h5 id="great-for-a-sub-15-mouse">great for a sub $15 mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, I can’t say that I could have asked for much more from a mouse. It feels great in the hand, and both buttons click nicely. I’ve been using it for about 2 months without a mouse pad, and the laser just about never results in the cursor “skipping” or getting stuck. Additionally, the setup couldn’t have been easier. I just plugged in the USB wireless receiver, and the MacBook instantly recognized it.The only negative I have is with the mouse is that the matte finish that Amazon chose. It looks awesome and feels great in the hand, but if you are like me, greasy fingerprints do show up occasionally and require some wiping. It’s not enough to discourage me from enjoying this mighty little mouse, though, as everything else about it is great for a sub $15 mouse. range could be better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-simple-honest-mouse-with-a-simple-honest-price">A simple honest mouse with a simple honest price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mouse follows the K.I.S.S. principle, Keep it Simple Stupid. You take the little USB dongle thing, toss in on your computer, flip over the mouse, turn it on, and your done. It works every time, and it works well. There is even a small compartment within the mouse to store the USB piece if you don&rsquo;t wish to, or are unable to leave it constantly connected to your computer. So as far as a mouse goes, its simple, efficient, and just works.Ergonomically though, this mouse is somewhat strange. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it slim by any stretch of the imagination, nor would I call it bulbous. So when you throw it into a backpack, it will leave a lump. But not so far as to call it in the way, just noticeably there. Similarly, I would neither call it extremely comfortable, nor unbearable. It feels slightly large in my hand, and when I think about it I don&rsquo;t particularly like it, but once I use is I immediately forget about it. The texture on it is also very nice to touch, so that may play into it.That is pretty much how this mouse is overall, it&rsquo;s neither the best mouse out there, nor is it the worst. It&rsquo;s astoundingly neutral in almost every way, which means your opinion of it will most likely be just that, neutral. You won&rsquo;t fall in love with it, nor will you despise it. Which is exactly why I recommend this product. It does exactly what it intends to do, and leaves out everything it doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a simple honest mouse with a simple honest price.So</p>

<h5 id="awesome-wireless-mouse">Awesome Wireless Mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This wireless mouse works great. It takes two triple A batteries and has a USB receiver that you plug into your laptop every time you want to use the mouse. When not in use, there is an on/off switch underneath the mouse and the USB receiver plugs back inside where you install the batteries. It&rsquo;s perfect for traveling since this Amazon mouse is smaller than the standard size mouse. I use it with my Dell XPS 13 laptop and it works perfectly, no complaints. It doesn&rsquo;t lag or have any interference. The roller to scroll doesn&rsquo;t make any noise at all and the mouseclicks are subtle but definitely audible. I definitely recommend this mouse, especially with the price point. I have yet to encounter a bad amazon electronic product.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine for it&rsquo;s cost, but I&rsquo;ve had it for a little over a year and now I need to wiggle the receiver in the USB port from time to time and one of the battery connectors inside&hellip;</p>
