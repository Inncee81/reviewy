<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The Comfort Plush Elevated Airbed is a part of the Dura-Beam series of airbeds that are providing amazing durability for years of lasting comfort. The secret is in the Fiber-Tech beam construction, which is comprised of thousands of high-strength polyester fibers that provide enhanced comfort, stability and support. Each bed is covered in plush flocking that is soft to the touch, and the horizontal air chambers provide added stability and support around the entire bed. The mattress is also equipped with a quality-tested, 20.8-gauge waterproof flocked top and 16-gauge sides and bottom for durability. And best of all, the Comfort Plush mattress is remarkably easy to inflate thanks to the built-in, high-powered electric pump, which does its job in a mere 3-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> minutes. No more fussing with tiring hand or foot pumps or rummaging through the garage for your detached electric pump. And should the mattress feel a little too soft or firm, you can customize the comfort level with the touch of a button. The Comfort Plush is raised 22 inches from the floor, making it far taller than most inflatable mattresses. And at 60 by 22 by 80 inches (W x H x L), the mattress is an official queen size, making it a good fit for fitted sheets. The Comfort Plush Queen bed&ndash;which offers a capacity of 600 pounds&ndash;is a terrific choice whether you&rsquo;re sleeping at the in-law&rsquo;s overcrowded house or setting up a guest bed in the basement. The mattress comes with an AC power cord and a duffel bag (for storage). Regarding Inflation: Measurements will vary based on the manner in which it is inflated and packaging disclaims “approximate size”. Airbeds are measured from the widest point including the beams (bulges) on the side and off the tallest point from the floor including built-in pillows if applicable. Location, temperature, and humidity will affect the airbed’s firmness. Airbeds will need to be occasionally re-inflated (topped off) to maintain desired firmness when used for more than a few days as vinyl tends to relax over time.If electrical power is not available then a separately operated pump can be connected to the control valve for inflation: simply turn the control dial to the inflation symbol, insert the air pump nozzle into the valve at the center of the control dial, and inflate the airbed.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-great-air-mattress-but-you-have-to-read-fully-the-instructions">A great air mattress but you have to read fully the instructions.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on many of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this product. It was either loved or hated. Many claimed it leaked air during the night. But I liked the built in pump and the height off the ground, important for an elderly couple. We have slept on it for two nights so we don&rsquo;t have a long term report to make. But I found as the air mattress engineer of the family I found it compact and I like the storage pouch that came with it for travel or storage. The pump filled the mattress quickly and was easy to adjust the inflation. I filled it at first and then let it settle out. Then once it had stretched out and all chambers filled, I pumped it up to the firm mattress we like for our backs. The first night we did find that it leaked air getting more like a water bed. Not good. But I had myself to blame, not the product. I had not fully read the instructions. The mattress and pump has a knob that changes the direction of the pump. One way for filling and the other way for pump all the air out so that it becomes completely flat for easy folding and storage in the supplied pouch. If that knob is not either all the way one way or the other, it can let some air leak out. But if firmly to the right (clockwise) for filling, then we found the second night that the mattress did not leak at all and stayed fully inflated until I pumped the air out for storage. A standard Queen fitted sheet fits perfectly. At a full inflation, one sleeper did not wake up the other when getting out of bed for a toilet visit during the night. Better than many standard beds. With additional uses, I may well bump the rating up to 5 star if it continues to perform as it seemed to on the two nights we used it.</p>

<h5 id="brilliant-fantastic-superb">BRILLIANT! FANTASTIC! SUPERB!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FANTASTIC! I would rate this item as one of the best products I have ever bought! We opted to buy an airbed for our spare room after my daughter rated the (new) futon we had in there was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. The Intex Comfort Plush Elevated Dura-Beam Airbed is PERFECT! We have already had another guest staying with us who was the first to use it and after her 10 day stay she gave it two thumbs up.It was easy and quick to inflate. VERY comfortable and the best part was the price - $55! Where can you buy a Queen Bed for that price? my final words are; if you are thinking of buying an airbed you can&rsquo;t go wrong buying this one. We LOVE ours!</p>

<h5 id="no-idea-how-90-of-the-people-get-these-bad-results-and-rate-products-at-1-or-two-stars">&hellip; no idea how 90% of the people get these bad results and rate products at 1 or two stars &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I know its hard to make a choice when reading many of the customers reviews on a lot of items on amazon however most of the time i have no idea how 90% of the people get these bad results and rate products at 1 or two stars and i wonder what the hell they are doing to the product to make it faulty. Anyways, i had read a lot of reviews on blow up mattress and finally made a decision despite some negative reviews. I ordered this bed, not just for the occasional camping trip but for my regular bed at home. It makes moving a hell of a lot easier. I have had this bed for 6 months, i pumped it up, and after it stretched a tiny tiny bit i turned the pump on for a half a minute to put a little more air in it. Since then i have not even turned the pump on again. Please do not listen to these idiotic peoples negative reviews they make me so mad that&rsquo;s why i chose to write this review. As a matter of fact not only do i use this bed every night, i have an 88 lb dog who jumps on to the bed with me every night and it holds up perfectly. If you take a foam mattress pad and throw it on top of this thing it makes it more comfortable too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for an inflatable air mattress for my daughter and my granddaughters for their visit at my house for 4 days and wanted something I can use many times and also something that was of high quality. I came across this Intex comfort Plush and after reading numerous comments I decided to get it. Of course there will always be comments that people will write that are negative but when you sort out good and the bad you can get a good idea of what kind of quality an item is. I am very happy with my purchase. Not only me but my daughter and granddaughters were happy since there the ones that used it for 4 nights. All 3 of them used it and it came through with flying colors. When this thing is filled up it is very rigid and stable. I don&rsquo;t know why some people were having issues with keeping this thing filled with air but I didn&rsquo;t have any at all. The only thing i had to do was refill the mattress with more air after a few hours after the things had stretched out but after that it was good to go.<em>UPDATE</em> Today is 9/26/17 and my air mattress is still going strong. I even had a big fat person sleep in it for a week. The only issue was he had to periodically put a little air in it as the mattress would settle. Other than that this mattress is a champ!</p>

<h5 id="lasted-3-months-only-and-popped-from-the-top-of-mattress-around-the-lining">Lasted 3 months only and popped from the top of mattress around the lining.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased mattress and a little over 3 months after purchase, mattress popped from the top portion. The whole is about 2-3 inches large. Nothing changed for the past week of sleeping on it and while laying down watching TV, all of the sudden the mattress just burst. We do not over inflate and do not keep any sharp objects around the bed. This is very disappointing as we actually like this mattress and the sleep quality. I hope Intex does the honorable thing and replaces our mattress as clearly it was defective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ended up getting two of these! These are sooooo comfy! It&rsquo;s difficult to remember you&rsquo;re laying on an air mattress. This mattress is very supportive yet soft. I slept like a baby every night and I&rsquo;m a picky sleeper! The built in pump is genius! It&rsquo;s a breeze to set up and take down. The pump does all of the work both ways, it puts the air in, you slightly turn the little ring and then it will suck the air out for you as well! It blows up fast and comes down fast as well! LOVE IT! Just remember to add air into every night right before laying down to get the best comfort.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far, so good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had the mattress a short while but it does seem to be working well. It is made of plastic and may give me problems in the future but for this short time of ownership, I am very satisfied with the construction and craftsmanship. I love the fact that there is a built in electric air pump. It took a very short well to inflate and it is conveniently located at the end of the bed making it easy to hide once the mattress is inflated.</p>
