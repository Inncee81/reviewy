<p>The go sports 7&rsquo; x 7&rsquo; sports net is a must have for any Baseball or softball player. The net is designed to help players train in several key areas: hitting: hit off a tee or have a coach lob balls to hit into the center part of the net. Players can focus on swing mechanics and technique without having to Shag balls. Pitching: each net includes an adjustable strike zone that attaches to the net so pitchers can dial in their various pitches without needing a catcher. Fielding: setup the net behind a base and practice fielding balls and throwing accurately into the center of the net. The net sets up in minutes so it can easily be taken to fields for training, but it can also be used in your backyard. The net is made using a powder coated steel frame with a robust polyester net to withstand years of use. It is also backed by a go sports lifetime warranty so you can buy with confidence. This is a must have for any Baseball or softball player looking to take their game to the next level.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="net-for-my-9-year-old-son-and-it-s-awesome-really-well-made">&hellip; net for my 9 year old son and it&rsquo;s AWESOME!! Really well made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just bought this hitting net for my 9 year old son and it&rsquo;s AWESOME!! Really well made, very easy to assemble and half the price of Skillz, Easton branded hitting nets. I&rsquo;ve been coaching baseball for a long time and these nets are great. We use them at practice and before games for hitting warmup. I&rsquo;ve also set it up in my backyard for practice at home and it can be used for pitching practice as well. Highly recommended and as mentioned before, a great deal!! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-good-net-and-has-worked-well-for-us">This is a very good net and has worked well for us</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good net and has worked well for us, we have also used it for soccer practice. The net is a good value for the money. The reason for four stars is the carry bag is very poor quality, it began to show damage after just a few uses and I expect will be worn out far before the net is. Still a good choice just be aware if you need the carry bag to take a lot of abuse you may want to look elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-identical-upright-poles">Four identical upright poles!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product appears to be as well constructed as my much more expensive bownet- however I just unpacked it and attempted to set it up and noticed that there are four identical vertical poles. They are all bottom poles which means there is nothing to hook the net onto on the top. I am attempting to contact the maker to see if I can exchange to bottom pools for two top poles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended">Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product seems to be made with good quality, used it several times and still holding. Easy to assemble even for one person once you know how to do it and using a little common sense and at this price is a good buy. Recommended</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-and-exceptional-customer-service">Great price and exceptional customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great price and exceptional customer service. We had a minor problem with the first purchased net, but customer service quickly resolved the issue. Highly recommend this product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-mine-has-defect">Good but mine has defect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course it does what it is supposed to do but one of the two hooks on bottom that net clips onto was still welded closed so it can not be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="first-one-broke-i-day-after-use-and-now">First one broke i day after use. And now &hellip;</h5>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product for the money. Works just as great as the $150 ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didn-t-last-more-than-5-setups">Didn&rsquo;t last more than 5 setups.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked well the first four times I used it with my softball team. On the 5th setup the one elastic band tore out from the bottom of the net(see photo), rendering it unusable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-this-net-is-fantastic-very-well-made-and-easy-to-assemble">but this net is fantastic. Very well made and easy to assemble</h5>
