<p>With so much data, nüvi 2597LMT makes it easy to find addresses and millions of POIs such as businesses, stores, restaurants and other destinations. nüvi 2597LMT arrives preloaded with POIs, so there’s no need for you to enter that address information.

<p>Garmin Traffic
nüvi 2597LMT features Garmin Traffic to help you spend more time on the move. With Garmin Traffic, your driving map remains onscreen at all times.

<p>Comprehensive Driving Guidance You See and Hear

<p>¹If you purchase a nüMaps Lifetime subscription (sold separately or bundled together with certain GPS models), you will receive up to 4 map data updates per year, when and as such updates are made available on Garmin’s website, for 1 compatible Garmin product until your product’s useful life expires or Garmin no longer receives map data from its third party supplier, whichever is shorter. A product’s “useful life” means the period during which the product (a) has sufficient memory capacity and other required technical capabilities to utilize current map data and (b) is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. A product will be deemed to be out of service and its useful life to be ended if no updates have been downloaded for such product for a period of 24 months or more. Unless otherwise stated, the updates you receive under the subscription will be updates to the same geographic map data originally included with your Garmin product when originally purchased. In some instances, your Garmin product might not have sufficient memory remaining for you to load an update to the map data, in which case you will need to either (a) select reduced map data coverage for your updates, or (b) purchase separately a microSD™/SD™ card (if and as applicable to your Garmin product) and load all or a portion of the map data coverage for your updates to the card and insert the card into the microSD/SD card slot contained in your Garmin product. If neither of the measures in (a) or (b) can be used to address your product’s lack of sufficient remaining memory, then Garmin may conclude that the “useful life” of your product has expired. Garmin may terminate your nüMaps Lifetime subscription at any time if you violate any of the terms of this agreement or your subscription. Your nüMaps Lifetime subscription may not be transferred to another Garmin product.</p>

<p>²FREE lifetime traffic updates may not be transferred to another person or another Garmin product. Lifetime traffic extends for the useful life of your Garmin traffic receiver (as long as you own a compatible Garmin GPS) or as long as Garmin receives traffic data from its traffic supplier, whichever is shorter. A traffic receiver’s “useful life” means the period during which the receiver (a) has the required technical capabilities to utilize current traffic data service and (b) is capable of operating as intended without major repairs. Traffic content not available for all areas. See traffic coverage areas.</p>

<p>³User’s data plan charges, if any, will apply. Contact your mobile service provider for more information about your service plan’s data and roaming rates.</p>

<p>⁴Subscription may be required.</p>

<h5 id="a-nice-upgrade">A Nice Upgrade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to replace an older 5&rdquo; garmin that did not have lifetime maps. I was getting tired of being nagged to pay for a map update on the older unit. Also I wanted to upgrade to a Bluetooth device.I am impressed overall with the improved speed and sophistication of this device. Connecting to a satellite is improved considerably. Seriously it just takes seconds. My last unit kept searching for a satellite connection so long I was afraid I&rsquo;d get lost in the process.No more &ldquo;recalculating&rdquo; exclamations when you go off the suggested route. It quickly displays your new route with the suggested next turn.There are many more split screen &ldquo;junction view&rdquo; occurrences. These rarely appeared on my last unit.The user menu and graphical display has also been improved. The graphics appear cleaner and there is a menu tab on each screen.Regarding Bluetooth, The ability to use as a speaker phone when connected to your mobile device is nice.The Voice Command system is good but not great. it&rsquo;s fine when reciting pre-defined menu options but is hit or miss (mainly miss) when speaking addresses.The build of the unit is solid. Slightly thinner and curvier than previous units.I have not had any traffic alerts so really can&rsquo;t comment on that function yet.I&rsquo;m happy with the improved performance of this unit.If Voice command and the speaker function are not important to you, you could save some cash buy getting the 2557 model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is faster than our previous Garmin GPS model and does not have the clutter on the screen that the old one had. On the other hand the screen is harder to see, or seems to have a more limited viewing angle.I bought TFY GPS Navigation Sun Shade Visor for Garmin nüvi 42LM 4.3-Inch Portable Vehicle GPS and other 5 Inch GPS to go with this. I added three photos which 1) side by side with a BMW gps 2) without hood in direct sun 3) with hood on a bright day</p>

<h5 id="great-gps-big-improvement-from-old-model">Great GPS, Big Improvement from Old Model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For work, I have to fly to different cities and drive a rental car to different address. A GPS is mandatory and after 10 years, it was time to upgrade from my Magellan. I first tried the Garmin 2595LMT, the older version of this GPS on sale at Costco. After a week, I took it back to Costco, I wasn&rsquo;t happy with four major issues.The new model on sale here, 2597LMT, was due out any time. Only had to wait a week and I&rsquo;m really glad I did; Garmin fixed all four issues.*The first issue I had was how the old unit clipped onto the base, to get it to release using one hand, half the time it would slip out of control and fall to the floor. The new design lets you get a good grip and release it at the same time.*The voice was terrible, I couldn&rsquo;t understand half of the street names it was saying. I have a stock GPS in my 2006 Honda that sounded 10 times clearer. The new model now sounds just as clear or better then the stock Honda.*This new GPS has a LCD display that is not affected by polarized sunglasses, wow, what a difference! The old model would turn dark with a slight tilt of your head.*They got rid of the &ldquo;Real Picture&rdquo; of ramps and exits! Real picture sounds like a great idea, until you try to glance at a 2.5 by 2.5 busy picture and make out what lane your suppose to be in; really bad idea. This new one uses a great birds eye animated graphic that highlights the lanes you need to be in; you can just glance and see where you want to be.I&rsquo;ve only had this for a short time, but so far it&rsquo;s exceeded my expectations. There are a lot of other features, but for me the top features are the basic ones; seeing, hearing, and handling. The Costco unit did came with the upgraded HD Traffic cable, this one only has Garmin Traffic, I will probably pay the $60 for the HD power cable.Update 12/27/13: There seems to be a lot of concern about the LCD screen and polarized sunglasses. I&rsquo;ve posted a video on my main review to better show what I&rsquo;m talking about. I do not have the previous model that blacked out, but it did so just like my Dell computer screen does, so I used it. Even a slight tilt of your head started to dim the screen of the previous Garmin model. That problem is not on the 2597, they have done something different, I don&rsquo;t know what, but the new screen is far better. Any distortion you see in the video, is due to the sunglasses are prescription/reading lenses.</p>

<h5 id="terrible-screen-visibility">Terrible screen visibility !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen is very difficult to see, especially in day time.. If it is not perfectly perpendicular to the driver&rsquo;s line of sight, the contrast is very poor. My 5 year old Garmin is more useful, but it cannot be upgraded because the memory chips are no longer available. i hae icluded a photo of the new Garmin2557 on the right compared with my old Nuvi 1540 on the left viewed at a 45 degree angle. The image on the 2557 almost disappears! I have made adjustments suggested by Garmin support, but the unit is still unsatisfactory. Is it possible to return it? I am willing to upgrade to a better model and pay the difference.This unit is hazardous because I frequently have to readjust its position when I am driving and my passenger cannot view the screen at the same time I can.</p>
