<h5 id="heavy-duty-2-5amp-rated-cords">Heavy duty 2.5amp rated cords</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are heavy duty 2.5amp rated cords&hellip; The heaviest duty I&rsquo;ve ever seen!They are almost too heavy duty to the point that they pull slightly on a dash or windshield mounted device.These are must if using one of the 2.1 or 2.4amp chargers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OT7HQGG?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OT7HQGG?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00</a>). The lighter weight ones may seem nice, but they can&rsquo;t carry the necessary current to keep up with a Samsung NoteII or similar devices, used as a GPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-wouldn-t-but-again-matter-a-fact-its-already-in-a-cord-box-after-a-month">i wouldn&rsquo;t but again, matter a fact its already in a cord box after a month</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Horrible the pig tail is very stiff, if you stretch it out at all with any tension it will pull out of your phone. almost everytime i have used it in the last month i thought my phone was charging an for some reason it either pulled completely out of the charging port, come loose, or took for ever to charge my phone. it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to fast charge either i went back to a regular power cord and threw this one in a box for emergencies. waist of money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mediabridge-has-durable-products">Mediabridge has durable products</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased Mediabridge products before and know that their products don&rsquo;t fall apart like others I&rsquo;ve purchased. I drive a truck long distance and bought these to take on the road. I bought two of these cords to plug into the outlet in the sleeper berth for my headset and my phone. Cords don&rsquo;t get in the way like the ones that they replaced. Great price, cords feel thick and durable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="coiled-part-is-too-tight">Coiled part is too tight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems like a sturdy cable. The problem is that it is TOO stiff. The spring part of the cable is so tight, that it will pull your phone off the car seat or across the table. Great idea, but does not stretch out easily.I&rsquo;ll be returning this. Not worth the hassle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unsatisfactory">Unsatisfactory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Once again, I have been let down by Mediabridge. This is my 2nd and probably last purchase from Mediabridge. My first cable lasted slightly over a year before showing signs of damage at the micro USB end of the cable. (I&rsquo;ve got to bend and fiddle with that end before I could get it to work) My most recent purchase showed the same problems even before I started using it. It still works, yes, but it is not reliable at all. I plug the cable into my phone, and I have to contort the micro USB end to a certain position for it to start charging. I&rsquo;ve sent the guys an email and I&rsquo;m still waiting for a reply. I expected a premium and reliable cable but I got the opposite.Edit: I have received a reply from Mediabridge. I will be returning the defective cable and subsequently they will be sending me a new one on receipt of my defective one. The new one has got to be in perfect working condition!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pooped-out-after-2-mos-update">Pooped out after 2 mos - UPDATE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice if it would have worked&hellip; just stopped charging so I&rsquo;m guessing the inner wires came apart somehow. Used it lightly in the car.UPDATE - the company saw my review and quickly sent me another. So far it&rsquo;s working. Good customer service. Changed from 1 to 4 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-and-firm-cable-will-not-do-5-feet-like-it-says">Solid and firm cable - Will NOT do 5 feet like it says</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked up this cable specifically to keep it in my car. This cable is coiled with two straight ends. Between the front seats of my car (an Equus) is a covered compartment and inside is a USB plug. I am able to plug this in, and the straight part fits perfectly to the top of the covered compartment and out a small notch, allowing me to close the top and have the cable sticking out. The coiled part is very firm, so if you plan on stretching it, it is going to coil back up unless you keep some pressure on it (the weight of your phone will not do it if that is what you have in mind).It&rsquo;s actually quite short, a realistic length is just under 2 feet. The specs say it stretches to 5 feet, but in reality, you can forget about that. If you need to do that with a cord, get a 6&rsquo; cable, not this thing. This works great for small spaces (like a car) where you might want to have it extend as needed a little bit (few feet max) and that&rsquo;s it. It is a very sturdy cable, fits firmly into my phone (Samsung Note) and the USB plug. I only gave it 4 stars because it was wrong of them to say it is good for up to 5 feet. While it might actually be stretchable to that length, it&rsquo;s not at all practical.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cable-ends-failed-due-to-heavy-coil">Cable ends failed due to heavy coil</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 4 of these cables and the coil is too strong. I used it on my cell phone and Kindle in both my SUV and Truck and being careful to place the phone in the cup holder. The micro end, over time, bent in spite of my best efforts. Of the four, two ended up bent and the last one shorted out my USB car adapter. The charger was not repairable or have a fuse in it so I had to toss it along with the cable. I see from the latest picture that they seem to have re-enforcement at the ends. I have since replaced all of these cables with standard 3 foot non-coil cables and replaced the adapter in my SUV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="made-accordingly-its-a-cord-for-a-purpose">made accordingly its a cord for a purpose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>outstandingly well made</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-right-for-flexible-use-in-the-car">Just right for flexible use in the car</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what we needed! Short enough (coiled) to stay out of the way, but long enough to still use the phone without unplugging it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-thick-cable-i-returned-it">Very thick cable&hellip; I returned it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This cable was way too big. It makes me think of the old headphone jack cables of the 70&rsquo;s.I returned it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great power cord. It is substantial and will charge at the fast charge rate. I&rsquo;ve bought two more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cord">Great cord</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very high quality heavy duty cord. I bought it to replace a cord from a different manufacture that was twice the price and of lesser quality. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars-1">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish they made a product like this for IOS</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-quality">Very good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Heavy duty cord that is much tougher than one that I had been previously buying that cost as much or more and kept failing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charges my phone quickly and the coiled cord creates less of a mess in the car.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mediabridge-is-what-i-needed">Mediabridge is what I needed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this with my dual charging plug in my car. Works great.</p>
