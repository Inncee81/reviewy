<h5 id="fundamental-problem-with-the-version-2-arlo-pro">Fundamental problem with the Version 2 Arlo Pro.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Please be VERY aware that this product (Arlo Pro 2 1080p) has a serious flaw. It will regularly and randomly go offline and only removing the battery will reset it and bring it back online. When this happens the battery depletes at approximately 10% per hour. Thus completely dead in 10 hours.I have had an Arlo Pro 1 with five cameras for a long time without issue. But the Arlo Pro 2 has a fault and it is fundamental. A lot of people are discussing this on the Netgear community. Please be aware of the before you buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="added-features-over-the-pro-but-accessing-them-requires-the-camera-be-plugged-in">Added features over the Pro, but accessing them requires the camera be plugged in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I added on a new Arlo Pro 2 to my existing base station and camera set-up. Visually the Pro 2 looks very similar to the original. Something I did not anticipate, however, is that a few of the features you may be buying the Pro 2 vs. the Pro for, such as activity zones (for motion detection) and CVR only work when the camera is plugged into AC power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-set-up-and-use-good-video-quality-not-cheap-but-i-like-it">Easy to set up and use. Good video quality. Not cheap, but I like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> # Things I like ##########Setup (9.5)Setup was very easy. If you know how to install an app on your phone, you can set up these cameras. I was up and running with two cameras in less than 10 minutes. I’ve read that other camera systems have complex setup procedures. This is not the case with the Arlo.Ease of Use (9.0)I love the fact that within minutes of opening the box, I had a cloud based security camera system up and running. I was able to put the cameras anywhere in my house, connect AC power, and view streaming video on my phone and on my computer.Video quality (8.5)One of the reasons why I didn’t buy the original Arlo Pro is that people complained about the video quality. With the Arlo Pro 2, I believe the 1080p video quality is pretty good. I do wish, however, that a higher resolution Arlo camera was available, even if the higher resolution required local storage.Software (9.0):The mobile app and the website are both very easy to use and navigate. With other camera systems, I’ve read that the companion apps were subpar. I don’t think people will have any complaints with the Arlo app.Cloud Recording (9.0):The free 7-day cloud recording plan is awesome. I think the $99/year 30-day plan is reasonable. I’m even ok with the cost of the continuous recording plan. No long term contract is required which is also awesome.# Things I didn’t like ##########Expensive. While I accept that a quality security camera system won’t cost under $100 (like many systems on Amazon), I can’t help but feel that this unit costs too much. Perhaps the counter argument would be that the free 7-day cloud recording mitigates the cost over time.I wish there was a button on the main page of the app and website that allowed you to toggle all cameras on and off. An even better option would be to define camera groups that can be toggled on and off.You will still experience delayed recording unless your cameras are plugged into a power outlet.I wish the Arlo had better support for local recording. I’d like the ability to couple the free 7-day cloud recording plan with a local, continuous recording solution. I’d also like NAS support and the ability to host my own app locally.Branded accessories are overpriced.# Other Stuff ##########Night vision works, although I seem to get a better picture on one of the two cameras. I’ll post an update after doing some more tests.I haven’t tested the audio yet. I’ll post an update soon.# Bottom Line ##########I really like the Arlo Pro 2 system so far. I like the free cloud recording, easy setup, easy to use app, and video quality. It’s expensive, but if you can make do with the free cloud recording and USB storage backup, perhaps the cost is mitigated over time. The cloud storage will come in handy should a burglar attempt to steal or destroy your locally stored video.The increased video quality and the elimination of the delayed recording (when AC powered) makes the Arlo Pro 2 a better option than the original Arlo Pro.I think this is one of the best wireless consumer camera systems available. However, I still deducted one star. I want to see the local storage options improved upon. For instance, I’d like to see NAS support, an app I can host on a local server, continuous local recording, etc. I also want a higher resolution camera, even if the high-res videos can only be saved locally.I’ll post an update to the review after I’ve tested the system a little more. So far so good.# Tips ##########If the power cord is getting in the way of your mount, consider using the camera upside down, then correct the image by rotating it in your camera’s video settings.If you only need one camera, consider buying an Arlo Pro 2 camera and the old base unit separately.</p>

<h5 id="arlo-is-best-on-the-market-as-of-oct-2017">Arlo is best on the market as of Oct 2017</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Arlo is providing the absolute best wireless camera system on the market today. I use these cameras and systems both at home and the office. This new Pro 2 has features and a resolution no other current wireless camera has available as of Oct 2017. Ignore the negative reviews who I honestly believe are nothing but hired trolls.The difference between the Arlo Pro and Arlo Pro 2 is distinct. The physical sizes are the same. They use the same batteries. But the image quality is obviously much, much better with the Pro 2.I use all the Arlo cameras except for the &ldquo;Baby&rdquo; camera and the setup for each is easy. The battery life is amazing. I have installed the Pro cameras in very busy foot traffic locations with motion detection on which records the coming and going throughout the business day and a one and a half months on a single charge is typical.I hope Arlo continues with their development of new cameras. Would love to see a version with the motion detector removed, making the entire body of the camera much smaller and having image motion triggering for recording. I wish Alro would forget the damn speakers on the camera bodies. The quality of the audio coming out of the speakers is average at best but there is honestly no application where a speaker is valuable.I would recommend the Arlo Pro 2 without hesitation.Check out the photos and video I attached to see comparisons.</p>

<h5 id="1-star-for-quality-to-price-ratio">1 star for quality to price ratio.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like the idea of wireless SC, everything works great including the free recording for 7 days and all the apps and desktop interface. My only big complaint is that the VIDEO QUALITY it records on cloud and on the Base Station 2 sucks so bad that you cant really see faces and its only in a 15 x 15 room. Yes, both camera and base station is in the same room with no walls between them, and I have a hard drive plugged into the base station with no quality bump what so ever. The bandwidth per clip should be much higher than the counterpart via the cloud for best video quality but that is not the case. Bad video quality both cloud and hard drive, I&rsquo;m not asking for 15 bits of dynamic range on it but I just want option for higher bit rate on the hard drive recording, that is a fix that can be done on a firmware update but my money is on corporate greed to buy the next year&rsquo;s upgrade Base Station 3 upgrade or 4,5,6,7 8th station. This feels like Canon&rsquo;s strategy in upgrades. 1 star for quality to price ratio.</p>

<p>Easy easy setup. Grt resolution. Quite expensive. Continous recording should be free. Siren feature needs to be built into the camera instead of the base. Overall satisfied.</p>
