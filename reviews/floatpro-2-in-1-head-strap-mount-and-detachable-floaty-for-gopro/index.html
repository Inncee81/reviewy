<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-item-but-could-be-even-better-with-minor-improvements">Great item, but could be even better with minor improvements</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We used the floating head strap this week in some small to moderate surf and it worked fine, but it was necessary to hold onto the camera/strap when duck-diving through waves, and when getting tumbled in the surf. When the wave size increased we chose not to use it since we were concerned that it may be lost in the surf. The best suggestion we can offer is to provide an adjustable chin strap system that will prevent it from being pulled from the head in waves, or even whitewater. A simple adjustable strap similar to the top strap would do fine - some Velcro type loops on each end would allow the user to quickly add or remove it. Another option is to provide a tether that could be attached to an arm-band. Otherwise, this is a great mounting system that will fit over helmets &amp; wet-suit hoods and has many applications for a variety of action sports. All good designs can stand some improvement so we hope our suggestions were helpful!</p>

<h5 id="good-product-saved-my-gopro-twice-already-and-i-ve-only-owned-it-for-2-weeks">Good product, saved my GoPro twice already, and I&rsquo;ve only owned it for 2 weeks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Saved my Hero4 Silver in two surf sessions over the past 10 days. First one on NS Oahu, wave ripped it off, looked for about a minute in the whitewater, found it. Then a couple of days ago off of Magic Island a friend I was surfing with and filming zigged when I thought he was going to zag, gouged my board and in the ensuing froth, assessments and apologies &hellip; camera and headgear were gone. No amount of looking in the ocean or on the shore rockline turned it up, even went back at low tide with no luck. 3 or 4 hours later I got a call from a Honolulu fisherman who said she found it floating about a mile offshore; I had it back before the end of the day. Suggestions: (1) Make the whole top of the FloatPro bright orange or yellow, not just the edge trim; (2) leave a white space somewhere on the inside where someone can use a black Sharpie to write their name (I had mine written inside the GoPro casing); (3) consider an alternate/additional model that has some sort of chin and/or back strap to keep it from being ripped off in wipeouts (duck diving is not bad, that actually forces it back onto your head if done right); and (4) maybe offer a strap that is a little bit thicker/floatier, so it sticks out of the water more (w/ the weight of a camera dangling down from the headgear, the FloatPro floats a little low sometimes, sometimes being sucked a little under, which makes it more difficult to find). That said, mine worked and, since I don&rsquo;t want to mount the camera on the board and don&rsquo;t want to use a mouthpiece, it&rsquo;s the best solution I have found so far. For now, I&rsquo;m going to try to develop a habit to, where possible, grab the headgear with one hand when things get gnarly/foamy.</p>

<h5 id="comfortable-and-secure-in-every-situation">Comfortable and secure in every situation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this on our latest cruise thinking it would be an accessory. Ended up being my most used accessory for the Hero 5 Black. Numerous times snorkeling and a couple of times over rock climbing style helmets. Was very adjustable from use alone, to over a snorkel mask and the helmets. Comfortable and secure in every situation. Obviously, same GoPro mounting method, so very secure with no issues.It does as it says and floats the headband with the GoPro attached without any issues. It did come off a couple time while paddle boarding, etc. and always worked as I had previously tested in the shallows. I even removed the FloatPro from the headband (2 Velcro straps) and put it around the selfie stick.. With the GoRad stick I had it worked well. Depending on the weight of your stick it may vary.</p>

<h5 id="float-pro-head-strap">Float Pro Head Strap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took this head strap to Florida Sea Base (A Boy Scout High Adventure Base) and it held up well until the last use. The mount cracked after about 5 uses, however it still worked for a while. I will be sending my unit in for warranty, however I am disappointed it broke as my previous Float Pro Product survived the journey.Pros- Bright Color- Adjustable Elastic- Protects Camera Investment- ComfortableCons- Mount broke after about 5 uses- Does not fit well with snorkel gearOverall, besides the damage, the float Pro head strap was an amazing product and it saved my Go pro many times. Even though my snorkel gear caused it to come off of my head a few times, however it was not a big deal since it floats.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-also-not-too-bulky-that-you-feel-like-you-should-take-it-off-of-the-head-strap">It&rsquo;s also not too bulky that you feel like you should take it off of the head strap &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this on my trip to Gulf Shores this past week, and it has already paid for itself! I was ejected off of my jet ski after hitting something in the water at over 45 mph and the FloatPro saved my GoPro 4 camera. The orange edging allowed me to quickly find my FloatPro in the water while at the same time the color doesn&rsquo;t stick out too much while wearing it. It&rsquo;s also not too bulky that you feel like you should take it off of the head strap when you&rsquo;re not around water. Just leave it on all the time and you&rsquo;re ready for anything. A lot of the locals were asking me where I got the FloatPro and were curious if it worked. Fortunately/Unfortunately (for me - still a little sore..) I was able to answer both of those questions easily as this thing really does work!Suggestion for FloatPro: Make one for going around your ankle for those that use the suction cup on the jet ski to use as the foam stick on float that you see out there won&rsquo;t keep the camera and the suction cup floating if it comes off. If it stays on the ankle it&rsquo;s more the soft enough to drag the camera through the water, and if it comes off it floats! Great product! Keep up the good work and thank you for coming up with this. Saved my camera for sure!</p>
