<h5 id="great-big-screen-budget-friendly-tablet">Great big screen budget friendly tablet.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Galaxy Tab E is just what I wanted in a large screen tablet for my everyday use that was not very expensive but still perfectly capable. I realized a while ago that even though I love tablets my actual use in no way justified spending hundreds of dollars on a top of the line model - not for browsing the Internet, watching YouTube videos, writing, and reading. I also like to take my tablet with me everywhere - trips, work, and places I can sit and do some writing - so an affordable one is just way more practical. I’ve used small size tablets for a while but found myself missing a big screen, something in the around 10 inch size, but finding something with good enough performance at that size without spending quite a bit was difficult. Enter the Tab E.From my use of it I feel Samsung has struck a good balance between price and features with this one. There are a couple of areas where you can tell compromises were made for the sake of affordability but for a general use tablet if a big screen matters to you this one is hard to beat.Great things about the Tab E:-The screen is big, colorful, and responsive.-Performance is absolutely stellar considering the price. Everything is smooth, apps open quickly, switching between apps is fluid, and even running two apps at once works with minimal slowdown. It has handled everything I have thrown at it with no problem and never a freeze or even a hiccup. I was able to use it while it was installing and downloading multiple apps and updates when I first got it and not really notice.-It is running a very recent version of Android - 5.1.1. You have all your Google applications and everything you would expect from the operating system.-The shape is really nice. This is a very rectangular tablet. Widescreen is great for video watching and it is comfortable to hold. It is not a big square slab like my old Tab 4.-It looks good and feels very solid. It has some substance to it. Some might call it a bit thick or bulky but I like its solid feeling and it certainly does not seem cheap. It is missing the usual bright metal strip around the outside edge of the tablet but I like the more uniform all black matte look used here. The back has a grippy textured molding. Mine is in a case so I don’t notice this much but it would not be slick or easily dropped without a case. All buttons (home, volume, power) feel solid and very clicky.-Battery life has been excellent. I charged it full the day I got it and it was not until three days later I needed to charge it again and this was after considerable use.-There is an SD card slot for video storage to supplement the 16GB of internal memory. I think 16GB it a little limited but expect it at this price. The SD card slot makes it workable.-Wifi connection is strong. It gets full signal anywhere in my apartment and it both loads websites and downloads content quickly.Is is for Economy. Less good things to keep in mind:-While the screen is big and colorful it does not seem as high a quality overall compared to other tablets I’ve owned from Samsung. The resolution is not bad at 1200x800, which is really what I expected for the price. However, you can basically see a pattern of thin lines throughout that just says budget display. It is hard to describe what this looks like and it is not a defect as I’ve seen three of these tablets (my own and two local display units) and the screens all look the same. The screen is fine, just seems like cheaper/older/etc. tech.-The speaker… Every review has mentioned the sound. I was expecting worse, considering. The sound really isn’t THAT bad, a little tinny, but the problem is with the placement of the speaker. There is one speaker and it is on the back of the tablet near the camera facing away from you. I really won’t get why it was designed this way. I have a case that folds over and I find this helps redirect the sound towards the user. If you want to seriously listen to music I would recommend headphones or a bluetooth speaker, It is fine for streaming video as far as I’m concerned.-Some might find this tablet too thick or heavy. It is not super thin and weighs a little over a pound.Overall I would absolutely recommend this tablet if you want something budget friendly but a large screen is important to you. I did not really discuss camera but I just don&rsquo;t use the cameras on tablets, especially large tablets, so I don&rsquo;t really have an opinion. Keep in mind it is a bit heavy and the sound is average. At this price for a well performing tablet from a name brand like Samsung the Tab E is a very good choice. This is a basic tablet experience - no bells and whistles but smooth performance and function. I am very happy with mine.</p>

<p>Please take my review with a grain of salt; this is my first tablet of my own.I&rsquo;ve had this tablet for about a week and a half at the time of this review. My purpose for purchasing it was to have a convenient device for college use, and, I&rsquo;m not going to lie, to have some fun with it by watching videos and listening to music. For the price, it&rsquo;s everthing I could have hoped for. It runs at a decent speed, has great screen quality, and has a lot of great features. It comes with Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint, which is a huge plus for me. I can sync music directly with Windows Media Player, which is a huge relief since I don&rsquo;t have to wrestle with the travesty that is called iTunes. The internet reception is strong, and the device is bluetooth-capable.The camera quality is decent. In fact, my iPhone has a better camera than this device does, but I don&rsquo;t find it to be that bad.The speakers, though, are the biggest drawback. Pretty bad quality; very tinny. I recommend listening to media with headphones or a bluetooth speaker.Media, such as videos on YouTube and Netflix, work without a hitch. The screen quality is great.Another plus: this tablet just LOOKS good. Samsung does a good job of making their tablets aesthetically pleasing, and this is no exception. Very sleek and eye-catching design, and feels good in your hands.This tablet isn&rsquo;t the fanciest or highest-performing tablet out there, but it&rsquo;s all I need for school and general media use, and I&rsquo;m very satisfied with it. It does everything I could ask of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3.<sup>75</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>) I am writing this review from this tablet. I bought this tablet mostly to use as a comic book reader and for some Internet browsing while on the couch, in bed, etc. My primary device is a gaming desktop computer and I don&rsquo;t always want to be tied to my desk, and I felt my phone wasn&rsquo;t completely adequate for the purposes I mentioned. For my uses I would say it is a very good tablet. It has a nice large 9.6 inch screen, and the colors are bright and vibrant. The overall construction of the tablet feels durable. It has a nice heft to it and feels solid and sturdy. Performance wise it seems quick and responsive so far. I haven&rsquo;t had issues with lag with opening apps or scrolling. I&rsquo;ve played a bit of Fruit Ninja and Terraria and both ran smoothly. As far as playing videos it seems serviceable. I tested an episode of Narcos on Netflix and some YouTube videos in 720p, as the resolution of this tablet is 1280x800, and the image quality was as crisp and clear as 720p allows for anyway. Battery life seems to be good so far. I have been able to use it for several hours of reading and Internet use without having to charge the battery. It&rsquo;s also upgradeable to Android 6.0 out of the box, which is a definite plus over some other similarly priced tablets.Now as for the negatives, as I stated earlier the resolution is 1280x800, which I feel is a tad bit low for a tablet with a 9.6 inch screen. Another reviewer had mentioned being able to see the individual pixels that make up the display. I would say 90% of time, in my uses so far anyway, this has not been an issue. But sometimes, depending on the color composition of the image you are looking at you can see the pixels. Another thing other reviewers have pointed out is the sound quality. It does have only one small speaker, and it honestly doesn&rsquo;t sound all that great but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as bad as some other reviewers make it out to be. In my opinion it&rsquo;s about what&rsquo;s to be expected from a low-mid range mobile device such as this. It has a 1.2 ghz Snapdragon processor, and for my uses so far it&rsquo;s been fine, but I could potentially see that being a little slow for some users. I also feel I need to mention that I was able to get this tablet as part of a combo deal where I was only paying around 170 USD for the tablet. For the price I paid I think I got a good deal, but I feel it may be a bit overpriced not on sale/part of a combo deal.Final thoughts: For my purposes (comic book/e-reader, Internet browsing, and a bit of light mobile gaming) it works very well. If you&rsquo;re planning on using this tablet for listening to music or watching videos/tv/movies a lot, I would maybe recommend also investing in a decent Bluetooth speaker, as the sound quality does leave a bit to be desired. Also another reviewer mentioned something implying their on screen keyboard didn&rsquo;t work until they set it up, mine was working fine right out of the box. Finally, as I mentioned earlier this is a secondary device for me, and for my purposes it works well, and if your needs are similar it would most likely work well for you also. But if you&rsquo;re looking for something to be your primary computing/entertainment device I would maybe recommend spending a little extra on something with a little more computing power, higher resolution, and better sound quality.</p>
