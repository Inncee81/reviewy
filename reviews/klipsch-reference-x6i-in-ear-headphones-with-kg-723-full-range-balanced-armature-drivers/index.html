<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Color:Black
Taking the next step from our legendary, award-winning R6i in-ear headphones, the Klipsch Reference X6i in-ear headphones are packed with a single high-clarity, full range balanced armature, offering flat frequency response with an incredible fit. The Klipsch Reference X6i sheds size in the most important area—overall thickness. The thin design follows the oval contour of your ear and sits naturally inside the ear canal. Their minimal size is reflected in their design and proves comfortable for hours of use. Klipsch’s custom, single full-range KG-723 balanced armature delivers cleaner, more natural sounding vocals and defined upper frequencies only achievable through balanced armature technology. Advanced three-button mic and remote provide seamless control of your iPhone, iPad, or iPod while listening to music, watching movies and answering phone calls. Available in black finish, each comes with carrying case, clothing clip, four different sized ear tips and one-year warranty. With the introduction of X6i comes the most comfortable ear tip we have ever designed. Pre-installed on the product, we have redesigned our most popular ear tip into a super slim form factor. After extensive research, our surveys lead to the conclusion that ear canals are even narrower than we had ever expected. The super slim ear tip addresses that by using an even narrower and more tapered design, enabling people who have never found in-ear monitors to be comfortable to wear them without fatigue. However, all ears are unique, so included with the product are five additional sizes to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-good-quality-build-and-sound">Very good quality build and sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these because my R6i&rsquo;s stopped working, and I have to say that the X6i is definitely a step up. The clarity on these are very good even compared to the already good R6i. My only complaint (and this is not a major complaint at all) is that Klipsch has still not totally solved the issue of cord noise, despite changing the cord to a completely new design. There is a bit of space where the buds meet the cord, and when they bump against each other it makes a bit of a bump sound. I found it odd that it was designed this way; but not that big of a deal for me so far. The second gripe that I have is that it is a bit soft on the bass response, which is weaker than the R6i; but again not really a problem for me for most of they type of music that I listen to, regularly. Overall, the clarity and balance of the sound more than makes up, so I&rsquo;m definitely very satisfied with these.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-earbuds-but-i-do-have-some-problems">Excellent Earbuds but i do have some Problems</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> So i am a 10 year + Klipsch ear buds user , i do like these Ear phones (Ear Buds) but felt that they should have been better , read on for Pros and ConsPros- (As always with klipsch) Sound Quality , Really Good- Comfort is Best in Class . i have tried and tested load of ear buds (and i mean LOADS , i do consider myself an audiophile) and these have always been hands down the best for comfort- Durability (i have seen a few comments that this model has not done so good with durability and i will update this review if it indeed does break on me) , from the 1st Klipsch earbuds i owned (i think they were the s4 , no mic) that never broke on me like ALL THE OTHERS (it did end up breaking but this due to me stepping on it by accident) i then purchased the older model of these x6i (i can&rsquo;t remember what they were called) which did break on me but these was after years of use (3+ years) and now the pair i still use de AW 4i which also sound exactly like these ones and are 10 bucks cheaperCons- The Jack , it really should be an L Shaped jack (feels better and should last longer)- the controller - i can&rsquo;t ever seem to press the control the correct way round the 1srt time round i always have to adjust my hand or the control (may seem like nothing but this really annoys me)Personal opinion - i think these should be better than the AW 4i (as in sound quality and use a similar control) as both models sound exactly the same i really can&rsquo;t tell the difference between the 2 or they should be the exact same priceVerdictYour getting best in class comfort and top notch sound quality - the difference is day and night between the competition and klipsch , if you want the same sound signature ,quality , comfort and want to save a few bucks you can choose the aw 4i , but if you like this design then go for it! these are some damn good Earbuds</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-in-ear-headphones-would-recommend">Very nice in-ear headphones - would recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After having two different sets of Bose noise cancelling headsets that either broke or started to degrade sound-wise, I decided to go to an in-ear simpler headphone that isolated noise but not noise cancelling. These Klipsch headphones work great. Terrific, full sound. And are comfortable in my ears although took some getting used to. Very satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="durable-clear-sounding-earbuds">Durable, Clear Sounding Earbuds</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very, very happy with these earbuds. From 2011 until 2016, I purchased 9 pairs of either Klipsch, S4&rsquo;s, S4i&rsquo;s and S4ii&rsquo;s. I loved the sound but though I was very careful with them and kept them in a case, they would only last a few months, which was quite frustrating at their price point. A salesperson recommended these X6i&rsquo;s as an alternative. I listened to them in store and found the same neutral clear Klipsch sound I liked so much. And at the time, they were quite a bit more expensive. Well, I&rsquo;ve now had them over 1 year and so far their durability is outstanding. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-earbud-for-the-dollar">Great earbud for the dollar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Listening to my new X6i as I type this review. Compared to my set of R6 and the older set of Image S4 these are intended to replace, they are definitely flatter in frequency response. Clarity is better too. They really pull out nuances in well mixed/mastered recordings that are more buried with the R6/S4. Other major differences I can tell in the first 15 or so minutes of listening is they don&rsquo;t have the pronounced low end of the others I mention. They still reproduce low notes no Bose I&rsquo;ve tried can touch. As a live IEM, I&rsquo;d still take my Shure 315s any day, but these are listening earbuds, and pair well with an iPhone. Maybe a stretch to call them &ldquo;reference&rdquo; earbuds, but the sound coloration is definitely less pronounced than other Klipsch I have owned, but still have all the qualities I love about Klipsch earbuds. I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="klipsch-rock">klipsch rock!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>holy hell, i didn&rsquo;t know earbuds could get better than the rugged 4. these are spectacular! ear tips fit even nicer, clarity is through the roof. i love klipsch products. thanks for the fast shipping and great price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impressive-sound-needs-more-tip-sizes">Impressive Sound; Needs More Tip Sizes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These sound fantastic. It&rsquo;s a real pleasure to hear the music with such fidelity. I did have to buy some foam earbud tips that were big enough for my ears, though. No, I&rsquo;m not Dumbo. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sound-is-good-and-they-work-just-as-well-as-the-previous">Sound is good and they work just as well as the previous &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound is good and they work just as well as the previous generation Klipsch buds I had. Well worth the money in my opinion.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-for-about-4-months">Great sound, for about 4 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems I&rsquo;m not the only one. These are great headphones, sound and fit amazing. Until they die, the left side went out after 4 months. Would not recommend spending the money.</p>
