<h5 id="for-the-price-this-wireless-charge-dock-does-the-same-thing-as-the-official-samsung-wireless-dock-i-have-that-i-paid-almost-80">For the price, this wireless charge dock does the same thing as the official Samsung wireless dock I have that I paid almost $80</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I have the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and this wireless charger puts my phone right into FAST CHARGING MODE.This charger will work for all Qi-enabled phones. Although the dock DOES provide a fast charge you WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE an approved and confirmed &ldquo;fast charger&rdquo; yourself to take advantage of the fast charge feature. If you use a standard charger, and standard cables - the dock will not give you the fast charge you are expecting. See my photos and my video of how to tell the difference in your charging speeds on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Green light on the dock means you are fast charging.The dock stands upright, but you can place your phone landscape or profile, either way, it does not matter you will stick pick up that wireless charge. No more messy cables at your desk and you don&rsquo;t have to risk constantly plugging in and out of your phone ports which over time can cause damage to your ports and damage your phone entirely! The bottom of this dock has stoppers that grip the surface you have it on, which prevents it from sliding anywhere when you are dropping your phone onto it or taking it off.I have a relatively thick case on my phone, and this dock picked up the wireless charge effortlessly - without having to remove my case.For the price, this wireless charge dock does the same thing as the official Samsung wireless dock I have that I paid almost $80 for. What a great purchase!!!TIP:**If you need a fast charger, this is one that I have that I would recommend getting:Quick Charge 3.0 USB Wall Charger, Rerii 18W Full-Speed Charger for Galaxy S8, S7/S7 Edge/Edge Plus, LG G4/G5, HTC One M8/M9, Huawei, Sony, iPad, iPhone and more, Come with FREE GIFT Micro USB Cablene and will continue to do with my Amazon purchases.If you find my review helpful please let me know so that I can continue writing reviews that assist others while shopping on Amazon!Thank you! I appreciate it!-Juliet Romeo</p>

<h5 id="new-phone-old-cords-solution-right-here">New phone? Old cords? Solution Right Here.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter gave me a Galaxy S8 for Mother&rsquo;s Day and it uses a different charger than all of the cords that I currently have.Instead of having to buy a bunch of new chargers for the different rooms in the house, this solves everything!This charger works anywhere with any of your old charging cords!You just plug in to the base of this stand and set your phone on it and voila&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s charged.So happy that I can just place my phone on this device And charge my phone in no time .</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-this-charger-no-more-plugging-in-a-cable-for-me">Very happy with this charger&hellip;no more plugging in a cable for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I am very happy with this charger. It&rsquo;s inexpensive, reliable, and works as described.Pros:Charges Wirelessly, as it&rsquo;s supposed toCharges Very QuicklyCharges through my relatively thin case&hellip;I tried it on an old otterbox-style case&hellip;it worked but charging speed was degradedLED indicator to show it&rsquo;s charging goes off so it doesn&rsquo;t keep you awake if you use it on a night standSmall footprint vs designs that lay flatCan hold/charge phone in any orientationSeems to be high qualityAttractive designCons:Sometimes a weird ticking noise can be heard when charging, but from what I&rsquo;ve read, it might be the phone making the noiseDoesn&rsquo;t come with AC adapter, but you can purchase one for about $10, so $30 for a wireless fast charger is still a really good dealThis isn&rsquo;t a con as much as an FYI, but be sure your phone is listed on the compatibility list. My girlfriend has a Droid Turbo, and it doesn&rsquo;t charge on this pad&hellip;it does charge on my old Samsung pad, so I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s this pad. The listing does say something about how some phones will need an &ldquo;extra receiver,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>

<h5 id="neat-charger">Neat charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure this would really work, but it does. I have a Samsung Galaxy S6. It charges the phone. The only draw back for me, it it takes a long time to get a charge on my phone. This is why I have taken away 1 star.Over all, the PLESON Wireless charge is well made. High grade plastic and the charging cord ( about 4 feet ) looks like it will hold up. It is a slick looking black stand. The over all height is about 5 inches. I plugged mine into a UCB hub. But you can plug it into any of your USB outlets. It turns blue when first plugged in, turns green when phone is set on for charge.I believe this will save my phone from the charging port getting damaged daily by not having to stick the charging cord into the phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="should-have-a-plug-in-charger-cannot-be-used-without-one">Should have a plug in charger. Cannot be used without one.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be better had it included a plug in charger instead of just a USB cable. Had it included be a plug in, I would have given it 5 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice. My first wireless charger so new to it all. It is working just fine on my S8+. The charger itself looks very nice. Easy to place on and remove phone from stand. Feels sturdy. As far as charge speed, with phone @71% wireless says 51min wired and plugged in 41min. So I would say not bad. For those concerned or confused about needing a certain adapter for fast charge. If your phone will fast charge the adapter that came with the phone should work. For some might mean all you need is the adapter that you need. My S6 Edge that does not support wireless fast charge has an adapter that works on this for fast charge.This is all opinion but I like the looks of this much more than the $60 Samsung charger. Oval charger with rectangle phone is a bit of a visual conflict. @$60 I am not even sure if wireless charging would be worth it for me but at $17 it&rsquo;s great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-if-you-brake-charging-cables-like-me">Great product if you brake charging cables like me&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is great for anyone who brakes charging cables like I do. I would go through a couple charging cables every few month from being ruff on them or bending the ends so much they would split open and quit working. I am so glad I found this product and will never have to plug in another wire to my phone! I have a galaxy S6 with an otterbox case and I love how I can place my phone right on the stand while leaving my case on and it charges immediately. The stand also has a rubber grip so when your phone vibrates it will not slide off. I would recommend this fast wireless charger to everyone and will be buying another for my spouses phone.</p>
