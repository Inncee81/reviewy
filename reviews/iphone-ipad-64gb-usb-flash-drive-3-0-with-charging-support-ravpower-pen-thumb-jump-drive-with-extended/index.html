<h5 id="a-good-way-to-transfer-photos-and-videos-from-an-iphone-to-a-computer-frees-up-valuable-iphone-memory">A Good Way To Transfer Photos And Videos From An iPhone To A Computer. Frees Up Valuable iPhone Memory.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I seem to frequently seem to run out of memory on my iPhone. The iPhone (or iPad) is great for taking HD video and high resolution pictures. However, the higher quality video and pictures comes with a price. The file sizes are larger, and eventually my iPhone memory will fill up. Since Apple memory is not expandable, I must then delete some files, or, use a lightning cable to transfer them to my PC, or, transfer them to iCloud or iTunes, to free up phone or tablet memory. However, free iCloud memory fills up rapidly, and then you must pay monthly fees if you want more iCloud memory.I think that this RAVPower iPhone Ligntning USB 3.0 Flash Drive (RP-IM013) is a good solution to this problem. It is a 64 GB flash drive (USB 3.0) with a USB connector on one end of the memory device, with an Apple Lightning Connector on the end of a 2.5 inch flexible cable attached to the memory device.. As long as your Apple device uses a Lightning Cable for charging, you can plug this RAVPower Flash drive into your iPhone (or iPad), and transfer your videos, pictures, and music to the Flash Drive. You can then access these pictures and videos from your Apple device, whenever you plug it into your phone or tablet. Or, you can later plug the USB Flash Drive into a USB port on your PC or laptop, to transfer them onto your PC or laptop hard drive.Since a typical 16 GB iPhone only has about 10 GB of free memory (rest is used by the iOS operating system), all of your apps, pictures, and videos must fit into this 10 GB of space. Thus, after your typical collection of apps, you only have a few GB of space to hold all of your photos, videos, and text messages. This RAVPower Flash drive will give you a new 64 GB of space to transfer your photos and videos to. This is a lot of memory space, and you can access any of these photos or videos by merely plugging the USB Flash Drive into your Apple device, without taking up valuable space on your iPhone or iPad.A nice feature of this Flash Drive is that it can be used as a charging cable to charge your Apple iPhone or iPad. Simply plug the USB 3.0 connector on this RAVPower Flash Drive into your computer USB port (or a USB charger, or USB battery pack). Then plug the Lightning connector into your Phone or iPad to charge your Apple device.This RAVPower Flash Drive is compact and well made. It has a metal body with a standard USB connector attached to one end, and a 2.5 inch flexible rubber insulated cable attached to the other end, which terminates with an Apple Lightning connector at the end of the cable. It is lightweight and small, and can easily be carried in your pocket.An Apple applicaton (app) automatically comes up on your iPhone or iPad, the first time the Lightning connector is plugged into your Apple device, asking to install a iPlugmate app (published by HooToo). Simply touch Install on your screen to install the app. This iPlugmate app is used to control transfers of all files to and from your Apple device and this RAVPower Flash Drive. Operation is simple through the app. You will need iOS 8 or later to install this application on your iPhone or iPad. To transfer files to and from your PC and the Flash drive, no additional software is needed. You simply drag and drop files using your PC File Explorer, just as you normally transfer files between folders and devices.Although this device does not come with a paper manual, it does have PDF user manual files on the Flash Drive, in multiple languages. Just use your PC file explorer to find, and open the file that is in your language. Adobe Acrobat Reader (or any PDF reader) can used to read the manuals. You will probably find that you do not need the user manual, as operation of this device is simple, but it does give a good explanation of the use of the iPlugmate app.The side of the body of the flash drive has a built-in magnet. This allows the Lightning connector to be folded back to the drive for a more compact package to carry. However, I liked the magnet to stick the flash drive to my computer case, so that I always know where it is.I used this RAVPower Flash Drive with an iPhone 5S, iPhone 7, and an iPad Air 2. I really liked that this Flash Drive has an Apple Lightning connector on the end of a flexible 2.5 inch cable. This is important. It allows you to plug the Lightning connector into your iPhone or iPad, even if you have a case on your phone or tablet. Many of thet other Lightning connector USB flash drives that I have seen have a flush Lightning connector, which will probably not plug into your phone or tablet, without removing the case. Although this is not really a problem, some cases are more difficult than others to remove and replace, and it is inconvenient. This RAVPower flash drive worked with all of the cases that I used (even my thick Otter Box Commuter case), without removing the case, including all of my thicker cases. I now have plenty of memory space on my iPhone, and still have my photos and videos readily available to use whenever I want. The Flash Drive is nicely packaged in a small very sturdy black cardboard box, with a high density foam insert which is cut out to hold the Flash Drive securely.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-usb-drive">Awesome usb drive!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All you have to do is plug this flash drive in and transfer files in just minutes. My favorite part about it, is that while I am transferring files, the cable can charge my phone while it is plugged into a portable charger. This is awesome because I can watch movies that I have saved on the drive on my phone without worrying about my phone dying. Movies can be stored straight on the drive without taking up memory space on my phone, and since I have so many photos and videos on my phone, this is very convenient.I recommend for people who like to watch movies on the go, or to save room by transferring photos from your phone. I even love how it is magnetic so I can snap it together and throw it in my pocket whenever I need to. If you need to free up space on your crowded phone, or watch videos and transfer them, this is the drive for you! Especially since it can charge your phone at the same time!</p>

<h5 id="added-64-gig-to-a-16gig-iphone-and-apple-did-get-a-dime">Added 64 gig to a 16gig Iphone and Apple did get a dime!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Performed better than expected right out of the box. I was able to immediately clean out an overstuffed folder on my Ipad and transfer the photos &amp; videos quickly to my PC freeing up a ton of space. I then plugged into my iPhone and cleaned it up as well. To be honest the magnet part is a gimmick, I can&rsquo;t see the benefit in it. But the app they supply works perfectly on both iPhone &amp; I pad and on my PC. I just added 64gig to my Apple products without having to pay Apple a dime! That is a win. Seriously, this drive works perfectly and does exactly what is claimed. I checked the charging while plugged in and it worked too.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-adding-phone-storage-capacity">Great for adding phone storage capacity.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The RAVPower drive works like a USB Flash Drive on a Windows PC or on a Macintosh Computer. It has a USB 3.0 connector on one end and an Apple Lightening connector on the other end for use on an iPad or iPhone.The drive was very easy to install, just plug the drive into the phone. I plugged the drive into my iPhone 6 and a notification pop-up came up that the iPlugmate app wasn’t installed. I was given the option of going to the app store, which I chose, and installed the app. After the app installed, a firmware update notification came up. I let the firmware install.The iPlugmate app has on-screen help when you first start it up, with an overlay that shows what the selections/menus do. That was a very helpful quick start. The iPlugmate manual is included in the app in multiple languages as PDFs. They don&rsquo;t take up much room, but I deleted those language versions I didn’t need.Within the app you have the ability to launch the camera and when you take pictures or record video (30 fps), they are stored directly to the drive rather than on the phone. I recently attended a high school band Memorial Day event and recorded one hour of video clips directly to the iPlugmate with no problem. As soon as I got home, I plugged the drive into my PC and was able to quickly move the files off the drive for video editing.The app allows backing up the iPhone/iPad to the iPlugmate. I prefer not to use iCloud for backup. I really like having a portable device that I can back up my iPhone to, until I get back home and can back up to my PC with iTunes. The backup options are “Phone Backup” and “Backup Contacts”.The first time I backed up my iPhone, backing up 19.5 GB of data didn’t take long. The USB 3.0 speeds are also blazing fast for copying the files to my PC. At the end of the backup, the app shows a notification of successful/failed files. I haven&rsquo;t had any failures with any of my backups. There is also an option in the app to auto backup when the drive is inserted. It doesn’t get much easier than that, but it would be nice to have a selective backup, where you could pick and choose what is backed up. I like that the backup compares files on the drive to files on the iPhone/iPad and only backs up files from the iPhone/iPad that don’t already exist on the drive from a previous backup. Files can also be copied from the drive to the iPhone/iPad.The drive also allows charging the iPhone/iPad. I can now plug into a power pack with the same device I use for extra storage for my iPhone.I have used the drive with an iPhone 6 and an iPad Air 2 and haven’t had any issues with either.This review is for the 32 GB version of this product.</p>
