</ul>

<p>Works perfectly with all passive 3D Televisions - SONY, Panasonic, Vizio, Toshiba, LG, Philips and JVC. RealD Matched to work in home or in traditional theaters! Higher quality than RealD and competitors 3D Glasses (our glasses have thicker + scratch resistant lenses and stronger plastic for a longer life)!</p>

<p>Prior to now passive 3D glasses were either to heavy, bulky, horribly overpriced, scratched too easily or just plain low quality throw away style 3D glasses. eDimensional went back to the drawing board to bring you the best value as virtually every manufacturer got it wrong. You may have been to a 3D theater and gotten glasses that were recycled and scratched on the lenses – we decided to double our cost of manufacturing the lenses to make our lenses 1-2 times as thick as theater glasses and we designed them with scratch resistant lenses not to mention we also include a glasses cleaning cloth so there is no guessing on what to use to keep your lenses clean for a longer life. You may have had 3D glasses that were bulky and too heavy. Our 3D glasses are light as a feather and you will forget that you are wearing them. Finally you can now get top quality 3D Glasses at the best prices around that are perfect for virtually everyone!</p>

<p>NOT FOR USE WITH ACTIVE 3D TELEVISIONS
NOT FOR USE WITH HOME PROJECTORS</p>

<p>NOT FOR USE IN IMAX 3D THEATERS</p>

<p>A PASSIVE 3D TELEVISION IS REQUIRED FOR HOME USE</p>

<p>Thanks for looking!</p>

<h5 id="sony-clip-on-3d-glasses">Sony Clip-On 3D glasses.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With the Clip-On 3D glasses now family and friends do not have to wear both their glasses and the 3D Glasses, With the Clip-Ons it is like wearing just your glasses to watch 3D Movies. Less cumbersome!!!!</p>

<h5 id="great-3d-glasses-that-work-better-than-the-ones-that-came-with-my-tv">GREAT 3D glasses that work better than the ones that came with my TV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I buy and review a lot products from Amazon and for the most part the quality is good and the shipping is always great. Occasionally, I buy something that is a bit of a surprise. These EDimensional 3D glasses definitely fall into this category. I bought these to work with my Toshiba 3D television and was hoping that they would work as well as the Toshiba supplied glasses. After trying them and directly comparing them with the Toshiba glasses I found that they actually performed much better. The picture was much sharper and the 3D effect was more pronounced. They are also much lighter than the Toshiba glasses which is nice during a long movie. The flip up feature is very nice and even has a lock to hold them securely in the raised position. The most surprising feature of these 3D glasses is the price. Considering the quality and performance, these are a real bargain. Sometimes you can get more than you paid for. I did receive a discount when I purchased these EDimensional glasses in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Everything written in this review is my honest opinion.</p>

<h5 id="3d-on-a-budget">3D on a budget</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest an fair review. All opinions are my own.For many people wear prescription glasses it&rsquo;s a challenge to wear those 3D glasses. They either have to choose which pair to used or try to fit them over and risk scratching or damaging your prescriptions glasses.There is a warnings not to used them with NOT FOR USE WITH ACTIVE 3D TELEVISIONS, WITH HOME PROJECTORS, IMAX 3D THEATERS and only to be used PASSIVE 3D TELEVISION FOR HOME USE. The ED glasses have higher quality + scratch resistant lenses &amp; stronger plastic for a longer life. It comes for a retail box and 4 clips on Glasses, glasses cleaning wipe and instructions!I was amazed how well they work. I actually thought they would not work at all. They looks so simple.and four clip on glasses it&rsquo;s a steal for the price.</p>

<h5 id="great-3d-passive-lenses">GREAT 3D PASSIVE LENSES</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these Clip-On Passive 3D Glasses by eDimensional because we recently acquired a Sony 3D TV. These clip-on lenses are very lightweight and comfortable and they stay securely in place when the head is moved in any direction. They fit very well over prescription eyeglass the same as a sunglass clip-on shade. They work great and are quite stylish, and rather durable as they are a higher quality than RealD and competitors 3D, the eDimensional clip-on glasses have thicker and scratch resistant lenses and stronger plastic for a longer life. The passive 3D shades which requires no use of batteries and don&rsquo;t need to be synced, which means you can enjoy 3D images from anywhere in the room and free from interference of other objects. The images seen through these lenses are crisp and clear. I certainly do recommend these lenses.</p>

<h5 id="work-great-just-be-aware-of-the-few-very-minor-issues">Work great, just be aware of the few very minor issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Clip-On ED Sony TDG-500P Compatible Passive 3D Glasses work on my LG 4K passive 3D TV. The unfortunate part is you can see the clip at the bridge of your nose. Saving grace is after a few minutes, your brain ignores it and all is well. Still, it is an annoyance and there&rsquo;s nothing to be done about it.Last night I watched a movie for the first time with these clip ons, and it was the first time I&rsquo;ve fully enjoyed a 3D film. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was wearing anything but my normal glasses (mostly) and the film stayed in 3D for me the whole time I was in the theater. I can now finally appreciate 3D films to their full extent, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All thoughts on this product are solely my opinion.</p>

<h5 id="decent-3d-glasses">Decent 3d glasses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>SoSo, I have glasses. This becomes rather irritating for the 3d world. I know I could get contacts but they&rsquo;re expensive and I like my glasses.So I got these. They&rsquo;re not quite what I expected. Though, all 3d glasses feel a little cheap to me. So, I took off a star for that. But they work. They clip on. They enable 3d. That&rsquo;s all that really matters. I don&rsquo;t need to be fashionable. I just fear they&rsquo;ll break quickly.Thank goodness it came with 4 pairs. Going to the movies tonight. Gonna see if they work there too. Will update with that result :)Disclaimer: I received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. This review is my option and I promise you it reflects my real opinion.</p>
