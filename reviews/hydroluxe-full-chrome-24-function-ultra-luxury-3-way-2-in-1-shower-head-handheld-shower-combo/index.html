<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="best-value-in-this-price-range-solid-product">Best value in this price range, solid product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all&hellip; disregard any review you ever read on Amazon for a shower-head in THIS price range that starts with&hellip; &ldquo;It seems great but it&rsquo;s only made of plastic&rdquo;. That right there is an indication that the person reviewing these products is somewhat delusional. There are exactly ZERO handheld shower heads in this price range that are made out of metal. Repeat: ZERO. If you want one made of metal, be prepared to spend 3-4 times this amount, if you&rsquo;re not prepared to spend that, don&rsquo;t complain that your product is not made of metal. Adding &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not made of metal&rsquo; as a detriment is just not a valid criticism&hellip; Metal in this price range is a pure pipe-dream, and you should skip any review that starts with that lament.Yes, everything (except the hose for the handheld) in this shower head combo is made of plastic, but its hardened composite plastic and is among the sturdiest I&rsquo;ve found for shower heads in this price range, easily comparable to the MOEN I used to own (which cost more). The vac-metal chrome finish seems solid so far but only time and wear and tear will tell me how it will hold up. As mentioned the hose connecting the handheld to the valve IS indeed metal, and that automatically makes it better than the more expensive MOEN I owned, which had a plastic casing on it&rsquo;s hose.Install was simple and tools are not needed. Using the included washers and plumbers tape (use tape on the shower pipe ONLY) made it so my install was 100% leak free. Be sure to tighten the valve to the shower pipe as far as it can go so it won&rsquo;t move when you use the engage switch or grab for the handheld. Let some hot water run through the valve if you can&rsquo;t get it turned all the way into the proper position because of this. However be sure not to over-tighten it or its conceivable you may crack the valve. This isn&rsquo;t as hard as it sounds&hellip; just use good judgement.Suggestion: If you have mediocre to low water pressure: remove the flow control piece (easily removed with a small flathead screwdriver) from BOTH the fixed head AND the handheld unit. Then use them one at a time (engaging both at the same time with the switch will yield mediocre results if you water pressure isn&rsquo;t up to snuff).If you have good to great water pressure I suggest you remove the flow control piece from ONLY the handheld unit and leave it in the fixed shower head. I have good water pressure and found that the fixed head put out TOO STRONG water pressure with the flow control removed. This way you can also engage both heads at the same time. Without the flow control being left in the fixed head, when you engage both you get a stronger flow out of the fixed head and a mediocre to weak flow out of the handheld. This is because of water seeking the path of least resistance and not because of a design flaw. More water will rush out of the fixed head because it&rsquo;s closest to the valve. Leaving the flow control in the fixed head solved this imbalance issue for me. If you plan on using only one head at the same time I would still recommend the same. I found the fixed head put out TOO MUCH pressure without it&rsquo;s flow control valve, but again this all depends on your individual water pressure and your own individual feelings on how much is too much water pressure&hellip; so as they say &ldquo;your results may vary&rdquo;.The &lsquo;pause&rsquo; mode withstanding, I really like the different modes these heads offer. You&rsquo;ve got your standard high rain flow (normal shower stuff), a lower flow for those with high water pressure or are eco-conscious (not for me), the massage function (recommend you engage only one shower head to use this mode for maximum pressure output), the aforementioned pause mode (kind of useless in my opinion, if I want to pause I&rsquo;ll just shut off the water), and a really cool mist mode that even puts out a bit of a breeze when it&rsquo;s engaged (this mode will be GREAT for use during cold and cough season). Both the handheld and the fixed head offer all these modes, although I found the switch on the fixed head hard to move without rotating the entire head. Because of that you&rsquo;ll need two hands to change the mode on the fixed head.As a person with off and on lower back and neck problems, having and using both heads at the same time is going to come in handy. I can aim one stream at my back, one at my neck and get hydro-therapy for both at the same time.Extremely satisfied with this purchase. I compared it to a couple of the other items on Amazon in this price range and it beats them all. It also beats out ANY head in this price range (or 2x this price range) that you&rsquo;ll find at HD or Lowes. If you&rsquo;re realistic about what kind of product you&rsquo;ll get for this price range, this head combo will not disappoint you.Four stars because of the rigidness of turning the dial on the fixed head (if I could give it 4.5 stars I would), and I&rsquo;m reserving the fifth star right now to see about the lifespan of this product. I will update this review as time goes on and add on that 5th star if this thing lasts for me.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-shower-head-combo">Amazing shower head combo!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great shower head set. Both heads allow you to easily change the water setting, and a distinct click lets you know when you&rsquo;re right on that setting&rsquo;s maximum flow. The exterior of the shower head combo is a nice shiny chrome, and it definitely provides a luxury feel. The hose is lightweight and very high quality. I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with water leaking from either shower head or from the hose. For the price of this shower head, you can&rsquo;t beat it.However, this shower head set gets 4 stars for 2 reasons:1) The pressure it provides is a bit unimpressive. If you don&rsquo;t have high water pressure where you live, you&rsquo;ll need to remove the water flow restrictors. This can easily be done by gently prying them out with a flat-head screwdriver. Since no other reviews tell you exactly where they&rsquo;re or what they look like, I&rsquo;ve posted some photos to show them. There is a flow restrictor in both heads. They&rsquo;re small, round, black rubber rings. In the main head, the ring is a bit far inside the threads that screw onto the shower set&rsquo;s main pipe. In the handheld, the ring is inside the threads that connect directly with the hose.2) There are 2 holes in the main shower head of the set I bought that produce stunted streams. The water is&rsquo;nt as pressurized as the water from the other holes, and the streams shoot diagonally. It&rsquo;s nothing to really flip out over though, I just thought it would be worth mentioning.All in all, I would definitely recommend this shower combo for those shopping in the $20-40 range.</p>

<h5 id="great-but-remove-the-flow-control-if-the-stream-s-of-water-are-weak-for-you">Great but remove the flow control if the stream(s) of water are weak for you.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product at a great price! Works as well as much more expensive products.When I first installed this, I was underwhelmed with the intensity of the water coming out. I did some research and removed the flow control between the pipe on the wall and the shower head. Now the water comes out very strong from both heads. Wonderful!</p>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item less than a month ago and the main shower head has already broke.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="everything-is-adjustable">Everything is adjustable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Whether you&rsquo;d like one head or two to spray, one high and one low, different spray settings on each, everything is adjustable. Adjustments are simple: for one or two head spray, turn the knob on the right up or down until your desired setting is achieved. Whether tall or short tilting either the main shower head and/or the sprayer holder will give you the height you&rsquo;d like even if that adjustment is having one spray high and the other spray low and vice versa.For strongest water pressure turn on only one head, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which.Install was easy and without leaks, I did it myself without breaking a sweat or a nail.I didn&rsquo;t go through all of the available spray settings on the shower heads in this video. My intent was aimed more at how easily you can adjust the heads (height and spray setting) and which head sprays (one or both).Note: Adjustments are easiest while showering; I was standing outside of the shower.</p>

<h5 id="great-dual-shower-heads">Great dual shower heads!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent dual shower head!! I love the mist mode! Love how the mist produces a breeze with air, so awesome! I didn&rsquo;t have much expectations because of the price but I&rsquo;ve been very pleasantly surprised with how well these shower heads work! All the modes work very well. I also took off the water regulators and the water pressure has been excellent.Yes, its plastic. Its whats most common with these shower heads if you folks haven&rsquo;t noticed. I rent so I don&rsquo;t own a home. If you want to spend $200 and up on a metal shower head, go ahead. I&rsquo;ve read the reviews on metal shower heads and they get corroded like anything else! I have no need to spend that much on a shower head!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, this is an amazing shower head! Years ago I paid close to 100 bucks for something very similar at a local hardware store.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handheld-needs-a-better-home">Handheld needs a better home</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The handheld shower head holder is a little wonky. Be ready for unexpected wallops when trying to balance it back onto its the impractical and small bracket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This product has worked pretty well for us and for what you get and it&rsquo;s function, the price is phenomenal.</p>

<h5 id="great-overall-product">Great overall product</h5>

<p>Great overall product. Easily changed water settings and multiple orientation options make this a great shower head at a great price point.</p>

<p>Initially we liked the versatility. It was easy to adjust, albeit a little counter intuitive. But in just under 2 months of daily use the hand held hose failed. It sprung a leak.</p>
