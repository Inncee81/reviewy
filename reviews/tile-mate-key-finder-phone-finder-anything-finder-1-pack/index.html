<blockquote>
<p>Before I get into the actual device and app I want to make sure everyone understands how invasive this technology is before buying.The &lsquo;tile&rsquo; app is thee most privacy invasive software I have seen in a very long time. There&rsquo;s just no getting around it they tell you straight up, in both the TOS and Privacy Statements it tells you that the company can and will use the demographic information it collects on you in any way it wants including sharing it with partners. Anything that you upload to their cloud services belongs to them and you are giving them exclusive rights to use, manipulate and distribute that material in any way they choose without compensating you.Please view the screen shots from the set-up process below. This is shameless demographics collection that you have to know is going to be used to target you with all manner of advertising. The scary part is that even if you turn off location services on your own phone you&rsquo;re not safe. As it clearly outlines in the screen shots, anyone else who happens to have the app installed and is near you will cause the tile to report its location through THEIR phone. That&rsquo;s right, the company can find out where you shop, eat, go to church, jog, or walk the dog simply by your tile reporting its location through someone else&rsquo;s phone running the app. However, the other phones and their users will not be able to see your tile.Ok so the scary stuff out of the way. If you still want to use the service, well it&rsquo;s pretty cool.There is no pairing the tile through Bluetooth settings as you would normally do with a Bluetooth device. Once the app is ready to go it pairs with the tile easily and then there are some very interesting features. You do have to register and create an account in order to get to the point where you can tie a tile to the app. The process is simple and you can register right through the app. Once you&rsquo;ve created the account you will be sent a validation code via email. Enter the code in the app and you&rsquo;re off.I found locating the tile simple. You simply walk around with the app open and use the proximity feature to tell when your close to the device. Once you get a green circle you can make the tile play a little tune which helps guide you to it.If, and I say if reluctantly, you have location services turned on the web site will allow you to view the last known location of the tile(s) under your account on a map. Now proximity here is Bluetooth distance which is at best 10 meters (30 feet) so the location overlaid on the map will be fairly close to where the tile was left as long as the location services on your phone can actually get a GPS lock (this gets far to technical to explain here but buildings, underground parking and just about any structure can block GPS signals). This is really the idea for this feature, if you leave something behind the map will let you get close to its last known location. Then use the proximity feature to zero in on the tile.What I really liked, if you have the tile in hand but can&rsquo;t find the phone, double press the silver tile logo and if the phone is within range it will play a tune associated with the app. This only works if the app is left running. When doing this the tile itself will play a little tune. If the app is off or the phone is out of range, it plays a different tune that even without knowing what it means would indicate something isn&rsquo;t connected. Please see the screen shots below showing some of these app features.The Tie Mate puts a lot of capability into a very small device that touts a one-year battery life. There is no user replaceable battery and the company offers a cost-effective replacement plan for devices with dead batteries but at this time there is nothing on their site that indicates what the replacement charges are. The warranty matches the battery life, 1-year, and has the standard limitations.The size is similar to a large key fob so it doesn&rsquo;t add a lot of bulk to your keychain if that&rsquo;s how you want to use it. The 5mm diameter hole easily allows it to be added to a keyring or tie wrapped to almost anything. The volume when activated is sufficient when you consider there is only one small hole in the back that allows sound out of the Tile.Yes, it has limitations but it also provides an ability to find items that would otherwise be a lot tougher to locate.All in all, this is an easy to use device and there will be dozens of applications you could think ofI found the app very simple both to set up and useThe tile itself while having to real speaker isn&rsquo;t really loud enough to heard when trapped between cushions on a sofa or stuffed in a purseI like that pairing a tile with the app is painless, totally non-technicalWhen using the web interface, I found the site easy to access through both the app and PC onlineThere are so many Bluetooth devices we already use that we can have a good idea of the coverage that can be expected between phone and tileThe app works and does not require a 10-year-old to set it upGreat idea and product but beware the intrusion to your comings and goings.The included information could contain more detail. You need to head over to their site to get some details.I&rsquo;m dropping one star because the app needs to be open in order to call the phone from the button and this means battery power is going to be used. The product itself is so simple, one button for calling the phone but it&rsquo;s just another piece of technology laying around if the app is not running.While the app is uber invasive and I strongly suggest you read both the TOS and Privacy Statement before buying or using this device my review here is of the device and its performance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For 25 years I have helped my husband look for his wallet. EVERY DAY. No matter what system I tried to introduce him to, what basket was on the counter just for his wallet&hellip;was a dismal failure. EVERY DAY FOR 25 YEARS. I gave this tile to him for Christmas. It has been the best two months of my life.</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-really-work">Doesn&rsquo;t Really Work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a college student who keeps most of their valuables on a lanyard, having some way to locate all of those valuables is important. Last October, I lost the keys to my dorm, and after forking over an absurd amount of money for a set of replacement keys, I swore that I would do whatever I could in my power to prevent another loss like that from occurring again.According to countless reviews online, the Tile was the best option for keeping track of my lanyard. At first, it went well; I didn&rsquo;t really lose my keys so I&rsquo;d use the tile a few times a month to make sure that everything was in working order. And it was spotty; sometimes, when the tile was right next to me, it&rsquo;d take minutes for the app to locate the tile and ring. But, I brushed it off, because it would work eventually.That was until I had actually lost my keys and my lanyard. I spent a whole day running around looking for them, but to no avail. According to the Tile App, there were a few thousand Tile users around, able to find my device if they stumbled near it. But, absolutely nothing. In the end, I found my device (I had left it with a friend) and went to go pick it up. Afterwards, I had the Tile in hand and I wanted to know if it was actually working properly. I set the Tile to ring from my phone, and nothing. No sound at all. To clarify, the Tile claims it has a lifespan of 12 months, give or take a few. But, it&rsquo;s been only 4 months and the Tile is having problems. I&rsquo;m disappointed with the product due to its spotty reliability, and I don&rsquo;t plan on buying from Tile again.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-pet-finder">Excellent Pet Finder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We use Tile to help locate our cat. She was a rescue from the local shelter and she insists on going outside. My wife however insists that the cat must come in at night. This meant there were some nice summer nights where we were up until very late looking for our cat. Since putting the Tile on her collar we have had great success with finding her or just knowing when she is home. It has also helped us determine where she likes to hang out thus greatly shortening our search times. It would be nice if the signal had more range, but considering it uses Bluetooth it isn&rsquo;t horrible. I would rate the range at a maximum of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the average city block. It can also be as little as a few feet if your pet is under something like a parked car.</p>
