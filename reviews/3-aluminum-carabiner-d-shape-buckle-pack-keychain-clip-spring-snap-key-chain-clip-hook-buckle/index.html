<h5 id="impressive-look-and-feel">Impressive Look and Feel!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really nice. They seem to be well made and have a great look and feel. For me just the right size and lightweight. I liked them enough I ordered a set in each color to give away a multicolor set to family at Christmas. Stuff like this can be made useful for a variety of things.Carabiners have been around for as long as I can remember (I&rsquo;m 62) and you&rsquo;d be surprised at some of the things I have seen people use them for. Having a few extra around you might surprise yourself with what uses you might come up with.Just keep in mind that while very functional and long wearing, these are made of aluminum (no rust or tarnish) and are not meant for any heavy weight application like snapping them to a tow hook or a boat anchor nor to any safety device where life and or limb would be at stake. Aluminum is too soft for something like that. That kind of thing would require hardened steel and a safety lock on it to make sure nothing could unsnap it accidently.Oh, these are priced right too. Best I found on Amazon for the size at the time I bought them.3&rdquo; Aluminum Carabiner D Shape Buckle Pack, Keychain Clip, Spring Snap Key Chain Clip Hook Buckle - Blue 3&rdquo; (6 Pack)</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product. The carabiners are very sturdy and have good tension. They are great for a variety of uses like backpacking, hanging things, or attaching your keys to yourself. Overall awesome product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy Customer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid, good quality and value. Wow!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value-and-well-made">Good value and well made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping my keys on a carabiner for years. I ordered these to replace an older one I had (another manufacturer, another size) whose spring had weakened so the keys kept slipping off. I only really needed one, but for about the same price I got five. These seem really high quality, though they ARE stamped &ldquo;NOT FOR CLIMBING,&rdquo; so I figure you probably ought not hang anything heavy on it. I hope to find four folks to give my &ldquo;spares&rdquo; to. I&rsquo;m sure they will appreciate them, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="carabiners-were-strong-and-sturdy-and-held-up-when-we-added-products-to-the">Carabiners were strong and sturdy and held up when we added products to the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these in tandem with trunk netting to attach to the posts in the back of the seat headrest. Netting I had was too short so the carabiners provided that extra inch needed on both sides. Carabiners were strong and sturdy and held up when we added products to the netting. I would recommend these to others. One caveat - do not use to support heavier objects. I believe the carabiner instructions come with a weight limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-size-and-extra-sturdy">Great size and extra sturdy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These clips really fit the bill! I carry a large amount of keys (plus extra junk) on my key ring. When I ordered this product I was hoping for the best but what I received 2 days later was some thing better. The carabiners were slightly larger than I expected but so much stronger than I thought. Now my keys and all hang very nicely on my belt loop instead of in my pocket weighing down my pants. Now no worries about holes in the pocket and keys falling through!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-and-a-nice-color-too">Works great and a nice color, too!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m disabled and I bought these because I needed something to hang a UE Boom Bluetooth Speaker (it&rsquo;s blue) from a walker and from the battery powered crippled cart that I ride outside. The product works very well for that and since I got 6 of them I&rsquo;ll no doubt find other uses for them. They are well made and I expect they will last a long time. Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with them!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-organizing-your-pony-tail-holders">Great for organizing your pony tail holders!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product was as stated. Carabiners are working fine for my unusual application. That was to have a quick mechanism for my hair ties! Sorry, I cannot attest to their weight bearing load. I just want to be clear. I was looking for a simple organizing mechanism to organize my completely circular hair tie backs, easy off &amp; easy on. I admit that it is an unusual application of this product!Ok, if the company starts to market this as a product in hair accessories, can I please get some sort of rememberance for this divine idea? Namaste.</p>

<p>I was very pleased to receive my hot pink aluminum carabiner pack. It arrived quickly and will come in handy with attaching things to my backpack and gym bag. I LOVE the color!</p>

<p>They clip, and have keyrings, not much more you can ask for. Also the blue is a very nice blue.</p>

<h5 id="quality-seems-really-good-spring-is-good-and-strong">quality seems really good. Spring is good and strong</h5>

<p>Inexpensive, quality seems really good. Spring is good and strong. Great for its use as a key ring holder.</p>
