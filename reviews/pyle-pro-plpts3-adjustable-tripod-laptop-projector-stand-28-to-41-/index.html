<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="adequate-but-just-barely">Adequate, but just barely.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this item to serve as a platform on which to place my laptop while I worked at a life drawing class (for digital drawing/painting)&ndash;no real typing, no real mousing. So I don&rsquo;t plan on using it as a computing table&ndash;just a thing to hold it at roughly eye level.With that said, it will work marvelously for that purpose&ndash;after a little work.As others have said, the quality control leaves a lot to be desired. The materials are very high quality. The workmanship, not so much.The platform on the top is nice and large. It feels like plastic, and is textured on the top. Unless your device is covered with Teflon, it will stay just fine. I have no fear of the stand tipping over, given reasonable behavior around it. All in all, I am very happy, with one exception.The T-bar that the top is bolted to on mine is welded at a serious angle. As a result, anything sitting on top will be at about a 20 degree angle. I could exchange it but it&rsquo;s really not worth the trouble when I can just put something on top to level it.If I were ever to buy another Pyle product again, I would be sure that I had the time and was willing to exchange it if necessary.</p>

<h5 id="ok-at-best">OK at best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have mentioned the tripod base is actually pretty good, though a bit funky in design. Sturdy enough for our use but definitely would not work in a home with small children or large dogs. The legs should really splay out more for more stability.The top is something else&hellip;fairly thin plastic, easily deflected. I would imagine that if the stand fell over (hopefully without a laptop sitting on it) it would crack or chip. But it would be a fairly easy task to make your own top&hellip;just add it to the list of projects.The really BAD PART for me is that they obviously SENT ME A RETURNED ITEM and did not even bother to check it out before sending it on.The top was not in its plastic bag which was crushed in the bottom of the box. It was thoroughly scratched but not worth the bother to repack it and send it back to Amazon. The paper directions were balled up&hellip;.I assume the previous recipient got mad about them and balled them up in frustration. There were also some scratches on the metal tripod tubes.All in all we wanted to have a standup work station in our home so as to vary our position when spending too much time on the computer as this will fit the bill for that.Photo shows the balled up instruction sheets and plastic meant to protect the top found in the bottom of the box</p>

<h5 id="sturdy-tri-pod">Sturdy Tri-Pod</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I opened the box, I was impressed with the thick and sturdy tri-pod legs. I am using this as a portable laptop/projector stand for mobile presentations. The platform will hold my laptop and projector at the same time, which is why I bought it. Since the legs are thick and adjustable, you don&rsquo;t have to worry too much about it getting bumped and falling over&hellip;. unless someone tackles it.The thing I don&rsquo;t like about it is the plastic support brackets that mount the platform to the tri-pod. They snapped in half after about 4 uses. After I put away the laptop and projector away, I would tilt the platform to the side and fold the legs for storage. I loosened the wingnuts enough to allow it to to tilt and leaned it against a wall. It slipped and hit the ground, causing the plastic to &ldquo;snap&rdquo; with the force of the impact. I tried gluing it back together with JB WELD, but even that did not hold. Finally, I went to a home improvement store and bought 2 conduit hangers, a couple wingnuts, and two steel support brackets with pre-drilled holes. I drilled two small holes in between the holes already on the platform and secured it to the conduit hangers and brackets. Now it works even better and is more sturdy.If you are using the original plastic brackets, be very careful not to drop it. If you are tilting and adjusting the platform, make sure you loosen it completely to not add stress to the brackets.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">Don&rsquo;t buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Original review Oct. 18, 2014:It&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re careful. But it&rsquo;s not very sturdy. I also had to do some tweaking because the thumb screws under the platform are too close to the wing nuts, making it hard to tighten. Fortunately, I had some 6mm nuts that I could replace the wing nuts with. This worked much better. The stand still tends to tip over if you don&rsquo;t place the legs just right.Update Jan. 15, 2015:Well, I should have given this one star (or none!). It lasted three months. It tipped over for the last time. One the legs broke. It really is crap! I guess my frustration is still a bit fresh, but really, who designs these things? I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times it has tipped over with my laptop on it and crashed into other things around it.I mentioned in my original review that it&rsquo;s not very sturdy. Well, that&rsquo;s a gross understatement! I advise you to avoid this item and look for something with a better base, something more sturdy with a lower center of gravity, that is not so top-heavy. Also, I attached a small music stand with clamp (that served as a mouse pad) {<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OR7X1S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_54">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OR7X1S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_54</a>} and just tightening that up left deep dents in the pipe. That tells you how thin the metal is. Seriously, benefit from my misfortune and don&rsquo;t waste your money on this.</p>

<h5 id="adjustable-stand-for-notebook-computers">Adjustable stand for notebook computers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having seen the higher priced stands personally, this much less expensive stand meets and fits the bill. It easily raises to a height that, myself being 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; tall, I do not have to bend over to use it. Also, it get so low that sitting on an average chair is perfect height. It comes apart for travel or storage.Now the downside of it is this. The top unit that holds the computer does not adjust for angles. Also the lock mechanism that holds it on the shaft is bulky and as such for easy travel. Since I don&rsquo;t use it for travel, it&rsquo;s OK. Secondly, the top of the stand is smooth formica type of covering which can easily make your notebook fall off. I placed a rubber shelf padding material on it that really holds the computer from slippng. But other than these two things, for being one third the price of the others, it&rsquo;s a great stand, useful for its purpose and I like it.</p>

<p>Needed this to position a small mixer next to our drummer to directly gain and monitor his controls of the click, triggered drums/percussion, and effects, before sending to FOH,&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="watch-your-fingers">Watch your fingers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Watch your fingers with this one when opening and closing the stand &ndash; it will crush your fingers if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>

<h5 id="light-weight-use-only-average-build-and-quality">Light weight use only - Average build and quality</h5>

<p>Bought 46&rdquo; model. Not heavy duty construction. Only good for holding light items - bought to use as projector stand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The horizontal bar has a slight slant to it that is non-adjustable, I thought it would have a flat table top and then a slanting option.</p>
