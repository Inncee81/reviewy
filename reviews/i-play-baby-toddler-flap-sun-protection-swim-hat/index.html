<p>Babies have thinner skin that is more vulnerable to sunburn than adult skin and special care must be taken to ensure that it&rsquo;s well protected from the sun, our solid flap sun protection hat is made out of a water-resistant upf 50+ fabric, we have included a tie closure under the chin except on the just born size.How to measure head circumference:Measure around the most prominent part of your baby&rsquo;s forehead,just above the eyebrows,around the widest part the back of head.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second time I have purchased this hat!First time as a newborn (0-6 months) and now that he has outgrown that one I bought the next size up! (6-18 months)The great thing about this hat is that it is entirely adjustable sizewise so it will really last! There is a pull tab type thing in the back that you can make it tighter or looser in their head as they grow and always get the right fit.The back flap protects their neck and back from the sun. Which are common sunburn areas.The front flap (bill of the hat) does not get in their eyes like a lot of baby hats so baby can actually see!The material is nice and lightweight and airy so baby won&rsquo;t be super hot in this hat.I highly recommend it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-loved-it-in-a-newborn-size-so-we-bought-a-toddler-size-as-well">We loved it in a newborn size so we bought a toddler size as well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love this hat. It is very light weight with a mesh lining so it does not make my one-year-old too hot and he leaves it on his head. We don&rsquo;t even try the straps around his chin. We just let them hang. My favorite part about the hat is that it covers his ears and his neck so that I don&rsquo;t have to lather him with sunscreen all of the time. I marked that it was a little bit bigger than expected because my one year-old has a very big head and it is still pretty loose on him. But he is only one year old so it will probably last him through his entire toddler stage</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-pool-use-very-lightweight-and-good-sun-protection-but-can-obstruct-vision">Good for pool use, very lightweight and good sun protection, but can obstruct vision.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works well as a swimming hat, which is what I bought it for. However, I learned it doesn&rsquo;t work very well as an everyday sun hat for a couple reasons. I wish the brim was a bit stiffer &ndash; its a little floppy, so if it is windy, then it flops right over my son&rsquo;s eyes and blocks his vision. Also, it just obstructs his vision in general. He was wearing it at the playground, and he kept hitting his head on things that were just above ear-level, because he couldn&rsquo;t see them. Poor guy was crying and couldn&rsquo;t figure out why things kept hitting him in the head while he was walking around! I like that it is very lightweight and provides very good sun protection, but for an everyday &ldquo;running around&rdquo; sun hat, I&rsquo;ll use his regular bucket hat. He is 20 months old, head circumference of 92%, and the 2T/4T fit fine with just a bit of cinching.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-sun-coverage">Good sun coverage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 2-4 toddler for my 3-year old who is in 4T clothing, and the birth-6 months for my 3 month old. Both fit as expected and provide good sun coverage. I like that it ties under the chin and stays on when my 3 year old jumps in the pool. The front sags a bit when wet but it is thin and dries quickly so I just left it in the sun while she took breaks from the pool. My sister-in law bought the same hat in a department store fir 30% off, but who doesn&rsquo;t love prime shipping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-winner">This is a winner!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this hat! We had an iPlay bucket hat last year when my son was first born, but after reading reviews opted for this one now that he&rsquo;s a busy 15 month old toddler. I love that it offers so much coverage. It protects his face, ears and neck. Other hats can&rsquo;t say that (that I know of). The ties help keep it in place, which is very convenient. The brim is of a similar shape and size to a baseball cap, but instead of being firm it&rsquo;s soft and bendable. When it&rsquo;s dry, it&rsquo;s just fine. When it&rsquo;s wet (ie at the splash pad) it droops down and covers his eyes. At that point I have to flip it back on itself. It&rsquo;s nice that you can just ball it up and toss it in the diaper bag and that it is also machine washable, but I also wish the brim could be a little sturdier. I&rsquo;d take away a half star for that it I could, but since I can&rsquo;t I still love the hat enough to round it up to 5 stars instead of down to 5. I can&rsquo;t even count how many moms so far this summer have randomly come up to me to ask where I got this hat. It&rsquo;s really great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fit-weight-and-coverage">Great fit, weight and coverage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this hat for our 5 month old daughter. Her head size is in the 75% on the growth chart and this fits with room to grow but not too floppy.The coverage from the sun is good and the weight of the fabric is also light and didn&rsquo;t make her too sweaty.The strings to tighten the hat were also long enough as well.Overall this is a great hat and a decent value.I would order this again if we needed another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="baby-flap-sun-protection-swim-hat-gray">Baby Flap sun Protection Swim hat. Gray</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ii play Baby Flap sun Protection Swim hat. GrayCute little hat that gives plenty of coverage. the only down side is that the front flap falls down in my grandson&rsquo;s eyes during swimming lessons. I prefer a bucket hat that he comes out out of the water and can see. Maybe if the front wasn&rsquo;t so long &amp; if it had velcro at the neck instead of ties it would be perfect. It is an attractive hat for a little guy depending what you are using it for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-leave-home-without-it">I don&rsquo;t leave home without it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter wears this in the sun and when swimming. I love the coverage and it&rsquo;s super cute!!</p>

<h5 id="good-sun-protection-yet-lightweight">Good Sun Protection Yet Lightweight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these sun protection hats for my granddaughters. They&rsquo;ve worn them outdoors since birth to protect them from the sun.</p>

<blockquote>
