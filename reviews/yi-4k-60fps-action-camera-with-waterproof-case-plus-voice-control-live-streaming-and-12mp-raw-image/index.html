<h5 id="awesome-camera-but-still-waiting-on-firmware-updates">Awesome camera, but still waiting on firmware updates</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>5/13/2017 UPDATE: YI has released Firmware 1.0.18. This update is supposed to fix a lot of the memory card compatibility issues and add 24fps/48fps shooting modes, among other things. The update is available via the YI Technology website. I can confirm that the update allows for 4K 24fps and 4K 48fps. I have tried the camera with Samsung 128GB 100MB/s (U3) MicroSDXC EVO Select Memory Card with Adapter (MB-ME128GA/AM) and it works great! The camera displayed an error message when I first inserted the card. This was easily fixed by going into Settings &gt; SD Card &gt; SD Card Optimization and running the ~5 minute format. So glad to see that the YI 4K+ supports more cards now!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-I have had this camera for a couple days now, and the 4k 60fps video quality continues to blow me away. I own a 4k monitor, and the difference between 4k 30fps and 4k 60fps is extremely noticeable when you play examples back to back. In addition, you can slow the 60fps footage down to ~30fps and have half-speed 4k video. There are plenty of high-end professional video cameras that can&rsquo;t shoot at this resolution/framerate/bitrate!One of the biggest video quality differences is in the 4K bitrate. As an example, the YI 4K+ bitrate at 4K/30fps is ~100Mbit/s and at 4K/60fps is ~130Mbit/s versus the YI 4K bitrate at 4K/30fps of ~60Mbit/s. This means, even for 4K/30fps, the YI 4K+ will outperform the YI 4K in terms of compression and image quality.Externally, the camera appears to be very similar to the YI 4K. The only visible differences I can discern are the &ldquo;carbon fiber&rdquo; pattern, the microphone placement, and the USB-C port (instead of Micro USB). Most YI 4K accessories should work with the 4K+. I purchased a tempered glass screen protector made for the YI 4K that fit perfectly on my YI 4K+. I also purchased an aftermarket metal case specifically designed for the YI 4K that is arriving soon. It will likely block one of the microphone holes (since the position has changed), but I expect it to fit just fine other than that. I&rsquo;ll update if I have any problems.The biggest concerns that myself and others have right now are the missing features. When this camera was announced, YI stated that it would support voice commands, live streaming, and USB-C microphone input, among other things. YI has not yet released firmware updates that make these possible, and they have not released a USB-C adapter to allow for microphone input. Additionally, some people are having problems with Micro SD card compatibility. I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with my 64gb Sandisk Extreme. In all honesty, these features aren&rsquo;t a big deal to me, but they are to some people. They have promised the necessary firmware updates will be in place by the end of May, but I guess we will see.Pros:* Same form factor as YI 4K (accessories are compatible)* Voice commands, microphone input, live streaming are (reportedly) coming soon* Much higher recording bitrate for 4K video (larger file size but better quality)* Good battery life (better than GoPro HERO 5)Cons:* Requires a waterproof housing (included)* Still an unfinished product (waiting on firmware updates)So in conclusion, is the YI 4K+ worth the extra premium compared to the YI 4K? For me it was, but you&rsquo;ll have to decide that for yourself.</p>

<p>The other reviews say a lot about good and bad about this camera. I had minor issues setting up this one. Purchased this 64GB model Samsung 64GB 100MB/s (U3) MicroSDXC EVO Select Memory Card with Adapter (MB-ME64GA/AM) with Yi firmware 1.0.18 Build 669r (updated to v1.1.7)Bad1. No voice controls yet. Works in v1.1.7 firmware now.2. No 1080p 240fps yet. Looking forward.ReviewBitrateAfter first reboot of camera with memory card, it reports free space as 63,977,816,064 and camera under 4K/60fps shows 1:02:18 time left (change video quality to high from default medium in settings), which amounts to ~ 130 mbps, near reported max 135 mbps bitrate. Memory card after multiple speed tests reported a comfortable write speed of 30+MB/s . So the combo worked fine. The video looks jittery on my mac. Turns out VLC is unable to play Full UHD 4K 60fps video. Simple uploading in youtube makes it much better, However colors dampen a little now. Media Player Classic on Windows was able to play it. Thanks to user in comments.EIS only works at 4K/30fps and other lower fps options for 1080p etc. Worked wonders.Battery life:4K/60fps - 1:02:15 minutes of recording on 64GB card with 14% battery left.4K/30fps - 1:46:37 minutes1080p/120fps - 1:27:06 minutesCharging back averaged over 3 times 93 minutesForm factor/CostCamera has same form factor as previous 4K model. I upgraded from 2 years old 1080p Yi model, so I ended up buying some accessories such as newer battery packs. As of now taking off one star only because it has too many issue out of box and manual do not address them. Maybe the older 4K model at cheaper price is better for most users.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">Don&rsquo;t Buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Video quality is great. Build quality is not superb. The usb-c cover just flips open on its own. To use the external mic it requires additional adapter which are not yet available. Many of the promised features will be later firmware upgrades. The product was not really ready for production in my opinion.Update:&ldquo;Fully compatible with previous Yi 4K accessories&rdquo;&ndash;however&hellip;placement of internal microphone on the side means it is covered up in the Yi leatherette cover and the Yi Gimbal.Update: Still no firmware updates to enable promised features. External microphone is not a viable option at this point. Yi is promising to release a cable in May, but I&rsquo;m going to call their bluff. They have a history of making promises to release accessories to make their product worth the price point, but they don&rsquo;t, eg. bluetooth microphone, promised in 2016. Yi has really done a poor job of establishing a supply stream for the product and now they are misinforming or lying to customers with product concerns. Their marketing campaign has been deceptive in the past, from filming with a DSLR and marketing it as Yi footage, to creating fake YouTube videos demoing features that don&rsquo;t exist.I&rsquo;d steer clear of their products until they can make some sweeping changes to their current business model.</p>
