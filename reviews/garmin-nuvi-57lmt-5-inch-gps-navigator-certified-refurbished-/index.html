<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="garmon-6-inch-is-big-hit">Garmon 6 inch is big hit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing negative at all! I had one that was about 5 years old and there were 4 or 5 things that I wished they would improve upon and it&rsquo;s like Garman read my mind. Everything is perfect with this one. I especially like the larger screen, school zone warnings, easy labeling sites, and split screen at exits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-satisfied">Very Satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast delivery , great product and a great price. I am so happy that I am not trying to use my cell phone as a GPS anymore. One of the great features I did not know about surprised me yesterday. The Garmin started beeping. When I looked at the Nuvi I realized there was an upcoming school zone and I was being alerted. Great Feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="refurbished-doesn-t-mean-second-class-this-is-first-class-all-the-way">Refurbished doesn&rsquo;t mean second class. This is first class all the way.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good GPS. Far exceeded my expectations. Would recommend to anyone who was in need of a GPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Garmin is great! I had an older Garmin that started giving me issues with zooming in and out randomly, which was very annoying. This one doesn&rsquo;t do that at all. I like the 4 square feature and that it doesn&rsquo;t keep saying &ldquo;recalculating&rdquo; when I don&rsquo;t follow the directions to a T. The display options and the screen size are great. I like the QWERTY keyboard. So far I am super satisfied. I had not indication this was refurbished, other than it saying so on Amazon. Highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="this-refurbished-garmin-nüvi-65lm-gps-navigators-system-with-spoken-turn-by-turn-directions-is-exactly-what-i-needed">This refurbished Garmin nüvi 65LM GPS Navigators System with Spoken Turn-By-Turn Directions is exactly what I needed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How in the world I got anywhere out of town without one of these is a mystery. This refurbished Garmin nüvi 65LM GPS Navigators System with Spoken Turn-By-Turn Directions is exactly what I needed. I mounted mine so it&rsquo;s visible just above the steering wheel. All it takes is a few minutes going through the menu to set it up for out-of-town trips. I can then save the trips for later. The 6&rdquo; screen is easy to see and the spoken directions easy to follow. I especially like how when approaching major interstate exchanges it switches to split screen with a very realistic view of what I&rsquo;ll be seeing ahead before changing lanes and highways.</p>

<h5 id="nice-gps-with-some-issues">Nice GPS with some issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice GPS. It&rsquo;s quick, the screen is really bright and easy to read and the controls are very familiar if you&rsquo;ve owned a Garmin GPS in the past.I&rsquo;m docking 1 star because why oh why did Garmin decide to remove some of the useful tools that were built into previous GPS units??? Like calculator, unit converter and the Go Home buttons that could be placed on the home screen. I used them all the time and now I have to pull out my phone every time I fill up with gas and try to calculate my mileage. A calculator app can&rsquo;t possibly take up that much space or CPU usage!I&rsquo;m docking one more star because EVERY SINGLE TIME you power on this GPS, it prompts for region, keyboard layout, EULA agreement and the usual warning about using the device while moving (this is the only one I expect to see). WHY???? I know I can just put the device to sleep but if I&rsquo;m not planning on using it for an extended period of time, I&rsquo;d rather power it completely off instead.One more thing I don&rsquo;t like (and I knew about this going in but bought it anyway) is the USB connector. Why do they have a older mini-B connector on this GPS when they had a more modern micro-usb B connector on my older 2450? Doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense.I don&rsquo;t want to put anyone off from buying this GPS because those are the only negatives I&rsquo;ve found. But.. to me, they&rsquo;re pretty big negatives that might have pushed me in a different direction had I known about them (and done my homework) prior to purchasing this unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="satisfied">Satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Garmin nuvi 65lm has worked well for me. It has been accurate. The voice is clear and has better volume than my old 255. I like the 6 inch screen. I also like the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t tell you that it is recalculating which was really annoying. Lifetime maps is a big plus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-garmin-would-suggest-to-others-very-helpful-on-a-remote-vacation">nice garmin would suggest to others, very helpful on a remote vacation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I needed for a vacation. Easy to set up using a computer. Updated the maps once I bought it and will continue to update the maps forever because this garmin includes that. Would rather buy a garmin then rent a garmin from a rental car company for around the same price. Refurbished but cant tell. Order a map pack for it because I used it outside of the US and it worked perfectly. Even when it couldnt find a road because of desert terrain it kept a good signal and allowed me to pin different locations which comes in handy on the way back. Nice size screen, no need to go any bigger. Cord is nice length, holds a charge for a little bit after being charged which is helpful. It also has an auto shut off function when the car turns off which is nice as well. Would suggest to others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lost-some-great-fetures">lost some great fetures</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I replaced my Garmin 1450 and was really disappointed with this. Right out of the package it feels very cheap. Made with a very smooth plastic, no weight to it at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-but-maps-not-quite-as-up-to-date-as-other-on-line-maps">Works well, but maps not quite as up-to-date as other on-line maps</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t yet taken it on the road (just a few test runs locally). Loaded latest update/maps, and it seems to work well, BUT doesn&rsquo;t seem to be quite as up-to-date as Google Maps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-for-the-money">great buy for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>one has to be careful about refurbs, but this one was certified refurb so i took a chance. was well worth the money! is a great unit, easy to operate and view&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got the product. Do a lot of business traveling, that is why I selected this product. Delivery was quick and the product, so far is working great.</p>
