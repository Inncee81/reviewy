<h5 id="phenomenal-results-on-40-year-old-vinyl">Phenomenal results on 40 year old vinyl</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to admit, I was skeptical that this would make any difference in old vinyl. I recently started listening to vinyl again after 30 years, and was annoyed at the pops and clicks of static. I had read many posts about this system on vinylengine.com and decided to give it a try. I cleaned 20 albums this afternoon, and they sound better than I remember they did when they were new. It does not correct any scratches, but it virtually removes all static and pops. It is super simple to use, has great directions and the cloths that come with this system leave no lint at all. It takes less than 5 minutes to clean and dry an album.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="cleans-vinyl-unbelievably-well">Cleans vinyl unbelievably well!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Holy Crap! I can&rsquo;t believe how well it cleaned my records. I did 8 of them today. Some of them had fingerprints and surface mars and tons of dust. It all came off. Some of them still had some of the mars, on them, but none of the playing was affected and there were no surface noise from them. The one that really impressed me was Stryper - To Hell with the Devil. When I played it before I had this item, there was so much dust and crackling I could hardly stand it. I thought I had gotten a bad deal. After I cleaned it with spin clean, all of the dust and crackling was gone. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It played like it was brand-new. I highly recommend this product!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-only-choice-under-350-00">The only choice under $350.00 !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Spin-Clean system has been around since 1975 the literature says. I really, really wish I had known of it in 1977when I got my first decent turntable (..a Dual 504 I worked all summer for). At that time the wooden-handled &ldquo;Discwasher&rdquo;with its D3 fluid were sold as &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; items. They did a decent job for daily cleaning. The new, RCA-made DiscwasherRCA RD-1006 Discwasher Vinyl Record Care System is awful as it replaces the micro-fiber directional pad to&hellip;get ready, folks, corduroy!!The Spin-Clean is not for everyday cleaning. It is for cleaning any old OR NEW disc you have or will have. I recently bought a number of 180 gram vinyl re-issues and was ready to give vinyl up! HOW could it be compared to digital with all of the noise, even on new disks? I began to read on the problem, which led me to the Spin-Clean.Back when it was all we had, the music is what mattered. A few pops and clicks were expected and we lived with them, reducing them as much as possible. In the 1970&rsquo;s the quality of raw vinyl dropped and prices for raw vinyl so high that RCA and others began melting and recycling old vinyl without decent quality-control. Pops and clicks were stamped into these from &ldquo;birth&rdquo;. But I always wondered how record stations ever kept vinyl sounding as good as they did.CLEAN RECORDS are the answer to all of the &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; on enjoying records. The truth is they MUST be washed, somehow. Super-strong vacuum systems do very well but even they usually use a wet component in their system. These are self-motorized, semi-automated machines usually from $500 to $1500.00 . Great for the college library. At home, however, the Spin-Clean works just fine. YES, you have to use your arms and hands to spin the record through the brushes. It works&hellip;a motor to do it would drive up the cost and degrade the simple reliability of the unit. There is nothing to go wrong, really.Drying the records is the weak link in the process but if the record is washed properly and the drying cloths are clean it works great. The drying cloths are lint-free natural cloth and should be cared for well. They are important. That is why I recommend the deluxe kit. It has plenty of drying cloths and fluid plus extra brushes. I have found that if a record is very old, molded, stained, etc. it will need extra cleaning&hellip;even turning the record a quarter-turn, letting it soak. It loosens up some things that a quick three spins will not.If you have albums, 78&rsquo;s or 45&rsquo;s and want to hear them as they should be get this. Get this before you get a turntable! It is that good. It is not fancy but it works. The difference is in the SOUND. The biggest upgrade you can make to a vinyl playback system. A must-have. Along with items likeAudio Technica AT6012 Record Care Kit - Includes Record Care Solution, Brush Pad, Storage Base and Adhesive Tape and a stylus cleaner.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-well-value-questionable">Works well, value - questionable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mirror similar sentiments of many others: this system works well but based on materials, value is suspect. I have personally used many different record cleaning methods, and I&rsquo;m convinced you need both full immersion as well as vacuuming for the ultimate results. This system does get to some of the foreign matter embedded in the grooves, but not all&hellip; again, full immersion helps, over the pads, brushes and other methods more for superficial cleaning. Once I have a vacuum-process (the most costly of all), I should have the cleaning thing fully covered. The note on value? yeah, upon closer inspection, once the die/mold costs have been recouped, this is literally just a piece of cheap plastic and some solution&hellip; probably fair to charge closer to $40-50. (I bought the full system - ~$150)READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="inexpensive-way-to-improve-lp-sound">Inexpensive way to improve LP sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used to wash my records in the sink. This system is a bit of an upgrade from that method. It is very simple and results in a noticeable improvement in the sound of records. I spend a lot of time burning LPs to CD, and since I am making a permanent digital copy it makes sense to get the sound as clean as possible. My first step is to clean the record with Spin Clean, then record it using LP Recorder and LP Ripper (from CFB Software), then run the files through DAK&rsquo;s DePopper3 filter.The fluid used does a good job of suspending dirt and dropping it to the bottom of the tank &ndash; after cleaning ten records, the dirt is obvious. And unlike sink washing, Spin Clean does not get the label wet. Check out the video on YouTube to see how it works. Highly recommended for record collectors.READ MORE</p>

<p>This really did a good job of cleaning off really old records I had not played in a long time. One suggestion - use a quarter volume mix of 90% isopropyl alcohol and one drop&hellip;</p>

<p>The grooves for the rollers for the 10&rdquo; and 7&rdquo; record sizes are not cut deeply enough, so that the rollers tend to pop out when cleaning records of these sizes.</p>
