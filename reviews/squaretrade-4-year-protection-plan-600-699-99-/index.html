<h5 id="4-months-later-computer-is-still-not-fixed-and-the-5-day-claim-is-a-total-lie">4 months later computer is still not fixed and the 5 day claim is a total lie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchasing this item was the biggest mistake I believe that some of the reviews might be fraudulent, this was my experience with Square Trade in April I experienced a 55 minute hold time and was finally told that a &ldquo;certified&rdquo; technician would be sent to my home. The technician should up and could not fix the computer, he suggested that I run to Best Buy to pick up a external disc drive so that he could load software from there. I did so and honestly the only reason I did was because I really needed a working computer.The technician could not fix the PC so I decided to take it to a local repair ship who said that it would be cheaper to purchase a new computer and that fixing it would basically be like building a new PC. I contacted Square Trade and they said that another technician would come out and look at the computer and that this was there process. I was very upset by this point and said I want the money value of my PC. They than said that the technician needed to come out again and they would take a look at the computer. As of July 2nd the computer is still not repaired and I am still dealing with Square Trade.When I purchased the protection plan it said if the computer is not repaired within 5 business days I would be reimbursed, so far it was been four months and nothing has been resolved.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-purchase-this">Do not purchase this!!!!!! &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not purchase this!!!!!!!!!! - after buying you will get an email that explains that the coverage is restricted, meaning - they have loopholes in there to deny your claim for any reason,I am not sure how Amazon is allowing this scam to exist&hellip;.my example: bought a pair of solar panel lights, after a few month I found one panel was wobbling and finally broke off, the manufacturer denied warranty stating they only cover electrical issues,Square-trade stated they do not cover any issues since its an &lsquo;outdoor&rsquo; item &hellip;&hellip; Why then is the warranty is shoved down my throat on checkout ????</p>

<h5 id="no-worries">No worries.</h5>

<p>I love the added protection, but rarely had to utilize it, thanks to the high quality of merchandise protected under the Amazon name.</p>

<h5 id="hope-it-s-not-needed">Hope it&rsquo;s not needed.</h5>

<p>So what&rsquo;s to like about an insurance plan. They take your premium but let&rsquo;s see if they pay a claim?</p>

<p>Save your money. This warranty only covers the product if it breaks after a year of ownership. I tried to file a claim, but was given the runaround, along with a billion excuses.</p>
