<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="welcome-baby">Welcome, Baby</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have time to wait for this to arrive, you can get the exact same thing from AliExpress for a few bucks cheaper. I&rsquo;d gotten mine from there, but needed a baby gift sooner than a month. I had liked the product so much for my kid that I knew it would be a great gift to greet a baby sister.This was BEYOND what I had expected. The item itself? Standard. The trimmings and presentation? Superior and then some. If you&rsquo;re going to send a welcome item to baby via Amazon, this is the one to get.The swaddle isn&rsquo;t a swaddle. It&rsquo;s basically a cozy blanket that is hard to wiggle out of. There is very little constraining involved; your kid just will have a heck of a time trying to kick this blanket off. The hood is mostly for looks. I would suggest not using it or using it as a pillow to elevate baby&rsquo;s head a little. The hood doesn&rsquo;t come down far, but it also could possibly be a smothering hazard. The material is soft and washes easily from spit-up if you don&rsquo;t leave it to dry too long.As a cozy blanket for 0-3 months while kiddo is laying in their stroller, this is a great item with awesome packaging. If you&rsquo;re looking for this to last longer than early infancy, good luck. This is a welcome item only.</p>

<h5 id="cozy-for-the-baby">Cozy for the baby</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this swaddle blanket for an upcoming baby shower. I live in a place that gets cold in the winter. I love the swaddle blankets because it keeps baby warm without having to wrap her up with a blanket. The blanket keeps baby warm yet is breathable. The buttons are fixed which is safe. This product is made of a knitted material which is very sturdy and the color is a gray color which is very neutral. The only thing that I took a star off is because I didn&rsquo;t think it was very soft. Possibly after a washing it will soften up. I would not put the baby in the blanket without an outfit on to protect delicate skin. Other than that I like the product.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-so-cute-and-the-material-feels-great-it-is-exactly-as-pictured-and-came-with">This is so cute and the material feels great. It is exactly as pictured and came with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is so cute and the material feels great. It is exactly as pictured and came with a very cute gift bag. To bad I’m keeping this for myself, I’ll use the bag for another gift. It is a pretty decent size, and is easy to use. The hood isn’t too deep. I think a baby maybe up to 6 months could fit in this. Its not super long, not like other swaddles. So if you have a pretty long baby you might not have such great luck. It’s not a super soft material but it is soft and feels very comfortable. This is absolutely perfect for winter months. It will definitely keep my baby warm, I have no doubt about that.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-to-keep-a-baby-warm">Perfect to keep a baby warm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for a gift to give to my friends’ daughter, she absolutely loves it. It’s so soft and warm, made from knitting cotton and its great from newborn to 1 year old, SIZE:25 (L) * 20.5 (W) Inch. I purchased the grey which is great for boy or girl and very true to the color in the picture. Everyone who seen this fell in love with it because how convenient it is to use now with the winter coming and also how unique it is. This makes a wonderful and much appreciated gift for any newborn, I love it.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-our-upcoming-baby">Great for our upcoming baby.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I are expecting our first child this coming February and we are very excited about being able to keep buying things on Amazon for our child. We have been looking around the web for a while now and found this cuddling thing and added it to our baby registry. It&rsquo;s very soft and I think when the baby comes in February the baby is going to look so cute in this. The material is made very durable and I think that it&rsquo;s going to last and the quality on the buttons is great too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gift-for-new-parents">Great gift for new parents</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We got this blanket for our friends baby and they absolutely loved it. The baby seems to be very calm, cozy and comfortable in this swaddle especially during the fall / early winter months. They also did a nice little photoshoot with the baby in this swaddle and the pictures that have come out are nothing but adorable. The breathable material keeps air flowing and the baby wont feel hot. Overall this is a great product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-soooo-adorable-was-hoping-it-would-be-a-good-one">This is soooo adorable. Was hoping it would be a good one &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is soooo adorable. Was hoping it would be a good one and it is. My son&rsquo;s friend and his wife are having a baby and she crochets. So, I thought this would be a perfect baby gift. It&rsquo;s super soft and in perfect condition. The quality is great. I think she will love it as much as I do. This is very affordable. I would pay more for it for sure. I love the design too. I highly recommend this swaddle blanket.</p>

<h5 id="soft-adorable-unique-perfect-for-a-winter-fall-spring-baby-shower-very-pleased">Soft, adorable, unique, perfect for a winter, fall, spring baby shower! Very pleased!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Soft and simply perfect! Absolutely adorable! I&rsquo;m giving this to my daughter for her baby shower and I think it&rsquo;s such a unique and perfect gift for a fall, winter or even spring baby shower. You can trust and believe the receiver will adore it, it&rsquo;s very unique and there&rsquo;s a slim to none chance someone else will have gotten the same thing for her&hellip; I just absolutely love this. Very pleased!</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-feel-like-cotton-but-sooo-cute">Doesn&rsquo;t feel like cotton, but sooo cute.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No tag, and pretty sure it&rsquo;s not cotton, but soft and well-received by the new Mom (and everyone at the shower). Super cute.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="snug-as-a-bug-in-a-rug">Snug as a bug in a rug</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Adorable sleeping bag! It’s big enough for a newborn till at least a couple months old. My 6 month old nephew easily fit yet, but he was a preemie so he’s a little small yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-gift">Fun gift</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cute bunting bag but won’t last long since it’s only 21 inches long. Also, the knit fabric is scratching and not soft.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-swaddle-blanket">Good Quality Swaddle Blanket!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The swaddle blanket looks very cute and it&rsquo;s pretty thick. You can understand the quality by the thickness and the heaviness of the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-cute-giving-as-a-gift-for-a-baby">Very cute. Giving as a gift for a baby &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very cute. Giving as a gift for a baby shower when I took it out of the bag it had a smell to it so it definitely needs aired out and washed before using.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Awesome quality</p>

<h5 id="tassle-came-loose-good-looking-and-good-material">Tassle came loose . Good looking and good material</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a nice swaddle that I bought as a gift but unfortunately the tassle seems to have come loose. Finishing and quality check need to improve.</p>
