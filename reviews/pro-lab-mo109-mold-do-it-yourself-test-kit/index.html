Product Description
Exposure to mold is not healthy for anyone but the following individuals are at a higher risk for adverse health effects: infants, children, elderly, immune compromised patients, pregnant women and individuals with exciting respiratory conditions. When moldy materials become damaged or disturbed, spores (reproductive bodies similar to seeds) can be released in to the air. PRO-LAB Mold Test Kit can detect these molds. You do not have to see mold to test for it. The following are sources of indoor moisture that may cause mold problems in your home or office: flooding, leaky roofs, humidifiers, damp basement or crawl spaces, constant plumbing leaks, house plants, steam from cooking, shower/bath steam and leaks, wet clothes and clothes dryers vented indoors. This mold test kit should be used as your first step in identifying toxic mold spores that could be harmful to your health and your home. Safe and easy to use with reliable results. Simply follow the instructions, use the prepaid envelope included in the kit to mail back to our lab alongside our standard $40 analysis fee and you&rsquo;ll have your results back inside a standard work week!</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
This mold test kit should be used as your first step in identifying toxic mold spores that could be harmful to your health and your home. Safe and easy to use with reliable results in 48 hours. Optional lab analysis available.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="this-company-is-a-scam">This company is a Scam!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These guys ripped me off and have done the same to many others. They cashed my check and never completed the anlaysis of my samples. Then they have given me the runaround for over 6 weeks, refusing to submit a refund! I went to the BBB to complain and that&rsquo;s when I saw they do this regularly. Take a look at Yelp or the Better Busines Bureau (where they have an F rating). When you are doing the search on either of these sites the name of the company is Pro-lab, Inc. Their address is 1675 N. Commerce Pkwy. Weston, FL 33326 Tel: (954) 384-4446.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="go-for-a-dust-sample-instead">Go for a dust sample instead</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Air sampling is not the best option when testing for toxic molds and mycotoxins. We did this test and it did not show even close to what we were actually dealing with. If we would have went by these results then we would still live in the toxic house and be sick. Pleas check out Dr Shoemaker and the ERMI dust sample test if dealing with mold illness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-cheap-way-to-get-some-action-on-their-part">Good cheap way to get some action on their part</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this kit for multiple apartments and followed the directions for the sitting sample. This is very helpful when you have a landlord who refuses to fix mold problems especially if you have allergies. They can&rsquo;t blow you off once you have proof of the mold and by law they are required to do something. Good cheap way to get some action on their part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-think-you-have-a-mold-problem-i-would-recommend-this">If you think you have a mold problem, I would recommend this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to use and send it to the dust to the lab. The test time took a bit longer then their documentation says but that really wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The report they give is pretty easy to read and they explain what the different kinds of mold spores they found, how common they are and if they cause any issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-changed">Product changed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first one I ordered was great I was able to send it off and I got my results in a timely manner the second one they have completely changed what&rsquo;s inside the box even though it still shows a picture of a petri dish is actually something that you attached to a vacuum cleaner hose so I sent it back if they&rsquo;re going to change the product I wish they would updated on the listing .</p>

<p>Pro-lab mo109 mold do it yourself kitPro labThis is a great kid for doing it at home on your own. It&rsquo;s easy to use as you just swab an area of mode or you place a piece of tape over it.Once that is completed you put it in the petri dish and send it off to the lab. The lab doesn&rsquo;t take long to give you the results. They mail out a list of all molds that are in your house. They explain to you the dangers or not dangers. I got one back explaining that it&rsquo;s not good for People with asthma. It gives you a readout so that you can give it to a professional that will do the cleanup. Unless you want to do the cleanup yourself. With the readout you&rsquo;ll know if it&rsquo;s dangerous that you don&rsquo;t want to do it yourself.People with asthma.

<h5 id="stay-away-not-trustworthy">STAY AWAY! NOT TRUSTWORTHY</h5>

<h5 id="fee-is-in-description-fully-divuldged">FEE IS IN DESCRIPTION, fully divuldged.</h5>

<p>STOP! all claiming they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. It is clearly listed in the description of the product. A $40 lab fee. I would not buy an $8 MOLD test. Come on now.</p>

<p>The mold test kit is esstially a q-tip &amp; a nozzle to connect to your vacuum cleaner. It didn&rsquo;t even fit my vacuum cleaner &amp; was told by the company to send in the dirt from&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the kit and then sent in the specimen. After about 2 weeks I got an email that said they couldn&rsquo;t find anything..no mold, no dander, no mites.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t get better than this. Be aware that you do have to pay for lab test results. Duh! Of COURSE you have to pay for lab tests.</p>
