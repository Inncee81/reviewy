<h5 id="it-is-excellent-value-for-the-cost">It is excellent value for the cost</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We seem to get a lot of &ldquo;false alarms&rdquo;. Can&rsquo;t tell if it is birds, coyotes, deer, or even pine needles but it isn&rsquo;t someone walking or driving in that often causes the alarm to tell us something has triggered it. It is excellent value for the cost. We added a second sending unit as the first one would sometimes miss a car or delivery van coming up our drive. That still happens as we have a cleaning lady who drives just under the speed of sound and this Motion Alert often misses her car as it rockets toward the house. However, the UPS and Fed Express vans are quickly reported. Now the challenge is to get the cleaning lady to work at the speed which approaches how she drives.</p>

<h5 id="set-this-up-on-our-two-driveways-that-are-pretty-far-from-each-other-and-it-works-great">&hellip; set this up on our two driveways that are pretty far from each other and it works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We set this up on our two driveways that are pretty far from each other and it works great! It took a while to get them set up so they don&rsquo;t falsely go off, but it was worth it. We have a 2200 square foot open floor plan house and we can hear the chime from anywhere in the house. I really just wish they would have made an edit button. A button you can push when leaving the house so my husband can leave for work and the alarm won&rsquo;t go off and wake the kids! Ours will pick up cars or people walking. So far for the price we really love it!!</p>

<h5 id="great-unit-see-my-12-12-2015-update">Great Unit! See my 12/12/2015 update!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the base and sender unit as a package, but in less than a year, the sensor unit crapped out. But in all honesty, I may have been the cause for that early demise because upon inspection of the dead unit, it appeared that I may not have screwed down the cover tightly which allowed for moisture to enter the box. In 2012, we got 147 inches of rain, by the way. Speaking of screwing the cover down, the reason I had to open the box in the first place was because the AAA batteries had died. Twice. We live very rurally and do not get much driveway traffic, but the darn thing kept going off with false alerts and that ran the batteries down. I set the unit on the nearest distance and least sensitive, but it still kept going off when no one was coming up the drive. Yes, it could have been the deer or any of the many birds. Be sure to clear any plants or branches that might wave an alert in the wind.PRO: This thing works very well. The bottom of our driveway is about .2 miles (approx. 1,500 feet).CON: Uses up battery life.NOTE: When swapping out batteries, screw that lid down really snugly.UPDATE 12/12/2015: I just bought two more remote Add-on sensors and discovered something REALLY cool! I was worried about how I would be able to tell the alerts apart. Well, turns out that with each additional sensor, you get an extra beep. I now have one that beeps twice, one that beeps three times and another one that beeps four times. I wish the company would talk this up in their selling points, but I don&rsquo;t remember seeing it anywhere.</p>

<h5 id="i-ve-been-pretty-happy-with-the-chamberlain-cwpir-wireless-motion-alert-setup">I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with the Chamberlain CWPIR Wireless Motion Alert setup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with the Chamberlain CWPIR Wireless Motion Alert setup. I purchased two receivers and five sensors. My wife, who usually dislikes gadgets like this, affectionately calls it her &ldquo;electronic yappy dog&rdquo;. It does the job. The farthest sensor is around 500 ft away up a hill and the signal must go through a number of large trees. That sensor triggers the upstairs receiver reliably but not the receiver in the basement due to all the earth it would have to travel through. All other sensors trigger both receivers reliably. Only issue has been the infrequent false alarms. A low sun on a hot day, shinning through the trees just right, can hit the sensor facing West under a overhang and set it off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shipped-unit-did-not-send-a-signal-upon-motion-detect-requested-replacement">Shipped unit did not send a signal upon motion detect. Requested Replacement.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The particular unit that was shipped to me had difficulty registering with the base-station in &ldquo;learn mode&rdquo;. It wouldn&rsquo;t subsequently send a signal to the base-station upon motion detect (even though the green LED flashed upon motion detect). I doubt the base-station is faulty, since the one sensor that shipped with the base-station works flawlessly. The add-on unit does not.Note that I could get it to successfully complete &ldquo;learn mode&rdquo;, only after the following steps: Press learn button on BS. Immediately press learn button on sensor&hellip; nothing happens. Restart with pressing learn button on BS. Then change one battery on the sensor and upon power on, press the sensor&rsquo;s learn button &ndash; this caused the BS to detect the sensor. This shouldn&rsquo;t be required for &ldquo;learn mode&rdquo; to work.<em>Edit</em> The replacement unit worked right off the bat. The base station was able to register the new sensor in learn mode and the sensor reliably transmitted it&rsquo;s motion detect signal. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;upping&rdquo; my product stars from 1 to 3.</p>

<h5 id="nice-unit-lot-smaller-than-i-imagined">Nice unit, lot smaller than I imagined</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice unit, lot smaller than I imagined, looked like a toy, but works great and is easy to setup. The sensors are identifiable by the number of beeps the base outputs, 1 beep for sensor 1, 2 beeps for sensor 2, etc&hellip;.. no way the change the sound or the number of beeps the unit outputs. Seems to work well.Note,This is not a motion detector, as it wont detect an opening of a door or garage door, but rather a passive infrared sensor that detects heat, from a human, large animal or automotive engine in a car&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="scratched-a-security-itch">Scratched a security itch</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this to go with my base and another sender. I have a long driveway that ends at the side of our house, and we needed a way to hear when people were coming. We were surprised by people suddenly appearing at the front door and this gave us a way to be alerted before that happened.The installation was super easy. Just add batteries and pair the sending unit(s) to the base. When that is done go outside and mount the sending units and you are done. The cool thing is we have 2 tones set for our first sender, and 3 tones for the next one. This means that if we hear only two tones it is probably only a car Turing around in the driveway. We know with certainty that someone is actually coming in when we hear 2 tones followed by 3 tones.We have had some false alarms. As stated in the directions there could be false alerts in certain conditions when the sun triggers the unit. We had this happen when a setting sun triggered the unit. It was a simple matter of adjusting the sensor and it&rsquo;s shade. All in all I am extremely happy with the ease of installation and it&rsquo;s performance.</p>
