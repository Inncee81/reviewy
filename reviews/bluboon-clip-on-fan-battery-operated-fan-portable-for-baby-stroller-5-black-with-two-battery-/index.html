<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="best-buy-for-my-baby-great-item-wonderful-customer-service">Best buy for my baby! Great item. Wonderful customer service.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This BLUBOON Clip on fan turned out to be the BEST purchase for my baby among many items I have bought recently! And, I am not exaggerating. This product sets itself apart from many similar products by other companies on the following points:1) The speed can be adjusted by turning the dial instead of just having 2 speeds like many of the pprtable fans. So, the wind can be gentle or strong. I have found only a few products with this function.2) Two rechargeable batteries come with the fan. I have not found other fans with such an option. Yes, you can purchase additional batteries separately, but, it will be an additional order from a different company. Buying a fan with 2 batteries is more reliable and cost effective. The batteries actually work/last a while without charging. I don&rsquo;t need to charge before every time I drive a car.3) Excellent customer service! The package I initially received was missing a USB charging cable and a battery, though the fan itself worked perfectly. The customer service lady was quick to respond to me when I contacted them and was pleasant to exchange messages with. She took care of the issue immediately. By the way, the fan itself works tremendously well, so, please do not hesitate to purchace this fan based on my initial experience. It IS an amazing fan!The fan isn&rsquo;t too big nor small, so, it is effective and easy to use. It appears to be durable, it looks nice, and the clip works very well by grabbing onto something like a car seat handle or as a stand. Before purchasing this fan, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how well the fan&rsquo;s clip hangs onto the carseat handle. I was afraid if this product turns out to be unsafe for a baby. I am glad I was proven to be on those points. Even during the bumpy ride, the fan stayed attached to the handle bar of the car seat.The fan keeps my baby cool and not cold. Even when inside the car is still pretty warm, as long as the fan is on, I can put my baby inside the car fairly soon without running the a/c of the car for so long.This is a must have item for every parent. It will be good for pets and passengers in the back seat as well. I am also thinking of using it in the front of the car to send cold air to the back seat. I will literally take this fan everywhere I go with my baby from now on because I can tell the difference on her face. No more sweat. It is fairly quiet on the weakest speed setting, so, it won&rsquo;t wake up my baby. I highly recommend this product for everyone!</p>

<h5 id="the-best-fan">the BEST fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We LOVE this fan! It is absolutely wonderful!! We purchased this to use when we take our newborn for a walk but use it in our house to cool down ourselves. It works amazing, the charge holds long and we love that it is rechargeable. HIGHLY recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="chilling-at-the-gym">Chilling at the Gym</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty great little gadget. I love that it is battery operated, making a very portable. I bought it because I wanted to attach it to whatever machine I was using at the gym. Our gym doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a lot of air circulation. So far I have found a way to clip it to some part of each machine. I think the force of air pretty decent given that it&rsquo;s battery-operated. The entire fan swivels pretty easily which is helpful. I haven&rsquo;t had it long enough to discuss the battery life. I may follow up with that information. This is a good little product.</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-this">Very happy with this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what we needed! We have a baby with health issues that require us to keep her from getting overheated, and this has been perfect for the times we had to be outside this summer. We clip it on her stroller, and it has been perfect! The battery lasts a few hours on a low setting, so make sure you have both batteries charged or bring a portable charger if you have to be out all day. We read the reviews for several similar products before settling on this one, and we are very happy with our choice.</p>

<h5 id="very-convenient-lasts-long-and-actually-has-a-good-breeze">Very convenient, lasts long, and actually has a good breeze!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy the cheap styrofoam fan. That thing barely works. I had to try it to figure that out unfortunately. This fan is amazing, lasts a long time without needing a charge, and actually blows a lot of air! So great for baby carseat and stroller in the summer. Love that it is a rechargeable battery too. Very convenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fan-super-practical">Great fan, super practical</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My diva daughter loves this fan! The wind is always blowing in her hair when we are strolling! It was a little tricky to find the right place to hang it on her strollers, but we have worked that out. We also used this fan when we traveled in Italy this summer and stayed in apartments with no air conditioning. I was able to point it at my daughter so she could sleep more soundly in the heat&ndash;it also made some good white noise!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. Used in Disney for our granddaughter. We left it in the bottom of the stroller during a rain storm and found it floating in water completely covered. I thought, well that is the end of that. Nope, shook the water off, turned it on and it still worked great! Highly recommend!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-life-is-very-long">Battery life is VERY long</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fan is amazing and the battery lasts a crazy long amount of time! I bought this for my baby&rsquo;s stroller to keep her cool during the hot days, but I &ldquo;steal&rdquo; it off of her stroller all the time when I am outside to cool down myself when I&rsquo;m not with her!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sit still and it keeps rotating around no matter which way I position it in the stroller</p>

<h5 id="i-really-liked-this-fan-for-my-baby-s-stroller">I really liked this fan for my baby&rsquo;s stroller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really liked this fan for my baby&rsquo;s stroller, but I&rsquo;m disappointed in the battery life. The batteries didn&rsquo;t last longer than 3 hours of use.</p>

<h5 id="nice-fan-for-child-or-pet-stroller">Nice fan for child or pet stroller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this for my dogs stroller, works great on hot days.</p>

<p>Battery lasts on low through the night. The downside for some it that when it&rsquo;s on there&rsquo;s a blue LED that&rsquo;s pretty bright. Might be a deal breaker for some.</p>
