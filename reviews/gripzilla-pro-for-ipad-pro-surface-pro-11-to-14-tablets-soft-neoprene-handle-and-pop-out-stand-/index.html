<blockquote>
<p>Great product!! I use it with my surface pro 4 and love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-just-works">It Just Works&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Carrying an iPad Pro in the field is made way less daunting with the Gripzilla. I was turned onto this by a colleague who uses his iPad Pro in the field. The Gripzilla eliminated all of the hand fatigue I usually encounter when trying to hold my iPad during construction site inspections and building audits. The strap is also adjustable and rather comfortable for extended periods. It allows me to comfortably hold the monster iPad with one hand and no fear of dropping the devise. I have averaged using this three days a week for 6 - 8 hours per day with no flaws or regrets&hellip; Like the title of the article suggests, IT JUST WORKS&hellip; Swivel function is a plus but to get the best benefit, add a neck lanyard.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-husband-s-surface-pro-3">Perfect for my husband&rsquo;s Surface Pro 3.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this a gift for my husband. He uses his Surface Pro 3 at his practice for Electronic Health Records and was finding it difficult to useâthe size of the Surface is just a bit to large to grasp comfortably with one hand. This product solved the problem perfectly-he uses the strap to hold the tablet and can also use the Gripzilla as a stand. It&rsquo;s easy to attach, and you can connect the keyboard with the Gripzilla attached (important feature&hellip; didn&rsquo;t want to have to attach and re-attach the handle!)</p>

<h5 id="super-product-stellar-customer-service">Super product, STELLAR customer service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about this &ndash; not just about the product, but about LapWorks.My &ldquo;path to purchase&rdquo; of the Gripzilla Pro was Murphy&rsquo;s Law Meets &ldquo;Perfect Storm&rdquo; &hellip;. everything that could go wrong, seemed to. But thanks to truly stellar customer service from LapWorks, instead of feeling frustrated, I ending up feeling super-valued and very happy. :-)The longer version of the story is that I bought an iPad Pro in November. I&rsquo;ve never owned an iPad before, but I&rsquo;m a musician and an artist, and FINALLY, Apple had come out with a tablet actually large enough to make music READABLE to a middle-aged violinist with aging eyes. ;-) Needless to say, I jumped right on that bandwagon. I love the iPad Pro &hellip; but it is, undeniably, not as easy to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; for long periods as its smaller siblings. So I was looking for something that would make it possible to hold (and turn) the iPad Pro for longer periods (such as while standing to sing), and give me peace of mind that I wasn&rsquo;t about to drop it on the floor.The Gripzilla Pro sounded like just the ticket. Only problem? It wasn&rsquo;t in stock at Amazon. I emailed LapWorks directly to ask about the product, and almost immediately got a response assuring me that a new shipment of the product was due to Amazon the following week. Great! I&rsquo;m already happy.THEN, the following week, I got a FOLLOW-UP email from LapWorks confirming that the shipment had been received by Amazon and letting me know that the product was now available for purchase. Very nice! I immediately clicked through to purchase.The next thing that happened was that Amazon sent me the wrong product &hellip; specifically, the smaller version of this product (I know it&rsquo;s not called the Gripzilla, but I can&rsquo;t remember what it is called) for the smaller versions of the iPad. I emailed LapWorks again, and again, immediately received a response &ndash; an apology, an explanation, a clear idea of what to expect going forward, and an offer of a discount for my inconvenience. (Essentially, what had happened was that Amazon had inadvertently reassigned the SKU for the smaller-tablet product to the Gripzilla, so Amazon employees at the order fulfillment warehouse were filling Gripzilla orders with the wrong product.)Because of the problem on Amazon&rsquo;s end, the entire shipment of Gripzillas were frozen at Amazon (and unavailable for purchase) while it unraveled the mistake. The LapWorks representative apologized for my probable frustration, as he &ldquo;knew [I&rsquo;d] been waiting for a while now,&rdquo; and apologized, too, for not being able to send me one directly, as the company&rsquo;s online store was sold out. But he promised to let me know as soon as the Amazon SKUbar was corrected, and also sent me a coupon code for a discount off my purchase.Of course, the discount was nice, and much appreciated &hellip; but honestly, it was the continuous, very timely communication from LapWorks during a problematic purchase experience that was none of their making, and over which they had very little control &ndash; not to mention their determination to try to make things right for me &hellip; that impressed the heck out of me.THEN the actual product arrived &hellip; and it&rsquo;s wonderful. It&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted &hellip; very well-made, sturdy, great peace of mind. I almost wish I needed two, because I&rsquo;d love to reward a great company like this one with more business. I&rsquo;ll certainly be looking to them first for any other product-holding accessories I might need.</p>

<h5 id="buy-it-now-works-perfectly">BUY IT NOW&hellip;.. WORKS PERFECTLY!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this item on this past Saturday and I wanted to put it to the test on Monday and today at work. This is the item to have everyone. I tried multiple ones and sent some back to Amazon as I did not like them. This one will not be going back. The fact that you can still have your keyboard hooked up to it if you have the Surface Pro is a deal in itself. I am beyond happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for one. Buy it, use it, and you will not be disappointed&hellip; BUY IT!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-nicely-for-a-surface-book-and-maybe-even-bigger">Fits nicely for a Surface Book (and maybe even bigger)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this will fit a Surface Book screen nicely. Easy to remove and has a good firm grip of the device w/ out scuffing or getting in the way of the touch screen. Works great when I use the tablet only for One Note.I venture a guess if you are using this for a Surface Pro, you&rsquo;ll have to take the keyboard off. I guess I can try it on my GF&rsquo;s Surface Pro and see if you can leave it folded back, but I wouldn&rsquo;t think you would want to do this as it might crimp the edges of the keyboard cover.Only complaint is the ears stick up so when throwing into a laptop bag, it puts two pressure points if you have a very tight bag&hellip;and it is kinda pricey.One neat thing as it seems to be part of a system where you can unclip the handle and mount it to a wall mount or desk mount system. I haven&rsquo;t bought any of the accessories, but nice to know it is available.</p>

<h5 id="all-of-our-microsoft-surface-users-are-asking-for-the-gripzilla">All of our Microsoft Surface Users are asking for the &ldquo;Gripzilla&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product; easy to use, lightweight and strong.We had been previously been using another more famous brand, but users complained of the weight and not being able to use the Surface 4 stand as the shell was hard to remove. I previously ordered one unit for testing in our ER department and now have them in our BioMed, Pharmacy, and Nursing departments.Highly recommended for users that need to be mobile with a larger device without having to add bulk/weight, with the ease of use to remove when needed.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-device-for-the-ipad-pro">Fantastic device for the iPad Pro!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic! I bought this device as a Christmas gift for myself! I bought it to go along with the iPad Pro I had ordered also a Christmas gift for me!The device works just great on the iPad Pro, it is comfortable and can be put in just about any angle you could want. I had forgotten to reply soonerand noticed it today as I was ordering the SkyCrane device that works with the Gripzilla. Yes, as you might guess, another after Christmas gift for the man of the house! I will send a review of the SkyCrane after I receive it on Wednesday!</p>
