<h5 id="edifier-r1280t-vs-r1700bt">Edifier R1280T vs. R1700BT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edifier speakers&hellip; Who the heck are they and why don&rsquo;t more people know about them?Let me start by saying that I purchased these as a hold over until I could justify tube amps and quality passive bookshelf speakers (Okay, I really mean wives approval) but these make me question even going down that road.I was pleasantly surprised by the faithful sound reproduction, I mean I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting such full and rich sound from a $99 pair of speakers. I was so happy with them that I thought to myself that if the smaller R1280T is this good, what does the R1700BT sound like? Short answer&hellip; about the same but brighter. Yes it may reproduce lows better at lower volumes but I assure you that at 50-100% power it&rsquo;s hardly a noticeable difference and I prefer the warmer natural tweeter in the R1280T over it&rsquo;s more expensive big brother. I personally will be sending the R1700BT&rsquo;s back because the set I received is having some issues with the power switch. The R1700BT does have bluetooth and that alone can justify the additional cost, but you are also getting a larger amp as well making it a solid purchase. The looks of the R1700BT are modern compared to that of the R1280T being retro in my opinion. The R1700BT Edifier R1700BT Bluetooth Bookshelf Speakers - Active Near-field Studio Monitors - Powered Speakers 2.0 Setup Wooden Enclosure - 66w RMS is a great speaker with bluetooth, more power and a great price. But for me it was not the softer more natural sounding performer that the R1280T is.I did test these on my TV as well&hellip; Let me tell you that if you have a sound bar like I do (or should I say did), you have no idea of what you are missing. The money I spent on sound bars looking for the cleanest and easiest way to improve TV sound, I could have that tube amp set up a couple times over. However; it is kind of a pain since your TV remote cannot be programed to control the speakers, but if your TV has variable audio out you are golden! I like them so much I&rsquo;ll be ordering another set of these (R1280T&rsquo;s) for my TV.I took some photos of the two side by side as there is really not much difference in size. The R1700BT was basically the same height and width but with a sloped front that brings the base out a bit further. IMO, unnecessarily extending the depth.Either speaker is a winner in my opinion!Set up: U-turn Orbit Special Turntable w/built-in preamp and these Edifier R1280T Powered speakers&hellip; End of set up, and I love it!</p>

<h5 id="awesome-sound-for-100">Awesome Sound for $100</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am by no means an audiophile but I also didn&rsquo;t want cheapo junk speakers and I also wouldn&rsquo;t benefit from anything more expensive. I did alot of research and had a thread going on overclock dotnet. I gave myself a budget of $100 as I wanted better quality sound then cheap PC speakers and felt anything more than $100 for me and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference anyway.Originally I was looking at getting these Mackie CR3&rsquo;s:Mackie CR3, 3&rdquo; Creative Reference Multimedia MonitorsThey have very good reviews, arent super large and appear to be high quality. While a minor thing, and not even close to the reason I chose the 1280T&rsquo;s, but I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the green theme of the CR&rsquo;3. My system is read and black themed, desk is dark brown wood grain, and most else is black.Someone in the forums I mentioned brought up these Edifier 1280T&rsquo;s and I had never heard of them before. They also had relatively few reviews here. The reviews they did have though were good, specifically from the other 2 customers who mention the CR3&rsquo;s as well. Not being real into audio I figured if people vouch for the sound quality of both then I should consider all other factors.The 1280T&rsquo;s are larger (4&rdquo; vs 3&rdquo;) which depending on the space you have could be a plus or minus. For me I had enough room and figured if I could get bigger speakers for the same price I should consider it. Also the 1280T&rsquo;s have the controls on the side which I like, a elegant aesthetic to them that I think would fit in with more than the green of the CR3&rsquo;s, and they include a simple but useful remote. The 1280T&rsquo;s also have AUX RCA which I liked. The CR3&rsquo;s do have the ability to switch Right/Left however. I also like the front cover of the 1280T&rsquo;s.I just got the 1280T&rsquo;s setup and the quality was noticeable as I was taking them out of the box. They have that weight all quality electronics have to them. Everything was packed reasonably well and 0 damage to any items in the box. Got them hooked up in a minute or 2 to my PC and was blown away at the sound quality, even at lower volumes. One of my problems prior with a cheap bullet speaker was that dialog was hard to hear. Not with these the vocals/dialog do not get muddled by the bass or mids.Not being an audiophile the best I can do to describe the sound is to say its much more lifelike than any other speakers I have in my house or have heard when I&rsquo;m out shopping. It sounds natural, not like I am listening to speakers. I am also hearing instruments and sounds that I did not before in various songs/media. I would 100% recommend these to anyone with the same budget and needs as me.It was also recommended to me that I get a better cable than what comes with the speakers. This is the cable I got and while generally the cable doesnt matter to me the quality of this cable also impressed me.Mediabridge 3.5mm Male to 2-Male RCA Adapter (12 Feet) - Step Down Design - (Part# MPC-35-2XRCA-12 )I dont think you can go wrong with these. For what its worth Im sure the CR3&rsquo;s are not bad either, they may even be better in some ways, but I am very satisfied with the 1280T&rsquo;s.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-speakers">Great little speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a small apartment so I don&rsquo;t need a giant sound system. These guys have a nice sound (both treble and bass) and look great.I&rsquo;m pretty diligent about turning them off entirely when I&rsquo;m done with them, so I don&rsquo;t know how they act when you leave them on for days+ at a time.I&rsquo;m very happy with my purchase and am considering getting a second pair.</p>
