<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="stand-out-case-for-a-stand-out-product">Stand out Case for a stand out product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros-Fits as intended-colorful, &amp; may help inspire an art design- strudy- Flap covers the screen completely (slightly oversized)- Turns screen off, when closed&ndash; Does Not prevent the use of S Note from off screen with pen removal. (notes without unlocking the device)- Locks in firmly (Though easy enough to remove if you want to take it out of the case.- hides the MicroSD slot (which is a positive for me, as it limits temptation to remove it by others)- magnetic closing (the force isn&rsquo;t to strong, but good enough to hold it from normal use [no problems for me, yet])Cons- cover edges are prone to fraying (slightly over sized)- Can be finicky to stand (though once standing it&rsquo;s stable and solid)The other varieties are just as good. Even with a &lsquo;black&rsquo; holder, it looks great with the &lsquo;White&rsquo; version as well, and could easily, but black tablets would be far better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-and-literally-painful">cheap and literally painful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There were so many great reviews on this case, I knew it had to be great too. Nope. There are only two positives to this case: the cover design (I got the mosaic&hellip;very pretty) and the plastic corners to protect from corner drops. The case does not stand up like in the image, it flops all over and is just impossible. The material all over the case, cover and back, is very thin. The biggest downfall, and you can see it if you look closely at the edges in the picture, on the three sides of the cover, there is no cardboard. The plastic comes together sharply on the edges and downright hurt my hand when I held it with the cover flipped behind the tablet. I had to take it off. Since the material is so flimsy, you never have a chance of the cover lining up with the back of the case, part of it is always falling out of alignment.I bought a Moko case instead and am much happier with the product. I have no idea why fintie cases are the rage, but don&rsquo;t waste your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-case-iffy-auto-wake">Nice case, iffy auto wake</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is quite great. I like the thin form fit of the case around the tablet. My only gripe is that the auto wake function is totally hit or miss. Sometimes it works, most of the time it does not. I&rsquo;d have to trace it back to the magnets on the case not being flat on the surface when latching onto the cover flap. With these kinds of cases, every millimeter matters, and a tiny flaw like that can make it not work exactly as advertised.I&rsquo;m only dinging a star off for that because it otherwise does its intended purpose well, which is to protect my Galaxy Tab A.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="needs-some-refining">Needs some refining.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decent case, but has some issues. My auto wake sleep feature doesn&rsquo;t work at all with this case, and the upper right corner near the sleep button isn&rsquo;t really tight at all.Overall the case is sleek and sturdy. For the price I&rsquo;m OK with it. I do wish the auto sleep feature worked though. I may look at other cases due to this.Update: I have actually decided to return the cover. when I wrote the original review I was frustrated with the auto wake/sleep not working, still doesn&rsquo;t by the way, and at the time I hadn&rsquo;t noticed that there&rsquo;s no cutout for the SD card slot. This is rather annoying since I do occasionally transfer files to my pc, and may not have a cable handy.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it-it-hugs-the-tablet-extremely-well-and">I like it. It &ldquo;hugs&rdquo; the tablet extremely well and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Am still getting used to the product but for the most part, I like it. It &ldquo;hugs&rdquo; the tablet extremely well and fits all openings perfectly, to include the pen access. It&rsquo;s lightweight so it adds minimal bulk to the tablet. I am not yet totally pleased with the stand position unless you have the tablet on a firm (table/counter) surface. I use it often on a chair arm, so it&rsquo;s angle potential is less than what I would prefer. Design is cool!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-sweet-case-i-gotta-say">Pretty Sweet Case&hellip; i gotta say!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It looks really nice in person!This has got to be the nicest looking case ive ever owned, and I&rsquo;ve had a few tabs along the way. I just got it and its sturdy, cushioned and quite elegant&hellip; the sea waves crashing and colours are really vibrant.The only odd thing is&hellip; its really fragrant&hellip;like it smells alot like paint&hellip; but then again, it just came so probably by in the morning when it airs out things will be fine.Also the colours aren&rsquo;t exactly exactly a match to the pic&hellip; but i know screen printing sometimes has the colour matching problem where the image colour is just a little different to what it is in person&hellip; but overall. . so I&rsquo;m okay with itI recommend this aaaaaalot!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cover">Great cover</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my wife&rsquo;s new 10.1 tablet. It is a great cover and makes a little stand. Be sure to check if you have a 10.1 or 10.1 s pen. They take different cases. I did not notice ordered the wrong one. Realized when it got here it was different size. Sent back and had them send a the one for the 10.1 s pen. Extremely happy with them and cover. We will do business with these people again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-case-and-good-price">Good case and good price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this case for my daughter. She&rsquo;s very pleased with it. It&rsquo;s simple in design but protects that tablet when carrying in a handbag or around that house. I can&rsquo;t speak to whether or not it is ideal for drops because we both are extremely careful with electronics. This one works for her. I&rsquo;d purchase again. Not a bad price point either.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-cover-for-the-10-1">Perfect Cover for the 10.1!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect cover for the 10.1! Excellent quality, lightweight, and excellent design.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-very-pleased">I am very pleased.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is exactly as described. Slim, light weight and attractive. I am very pleased.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is cover fits my S Pen Tablet perfectly. The colors are so bright and vivid. My 9 year old granddaughter liked it so much she now wants one :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read the directions on here and got this when I have a normal Tab A 10.1 (not with the S Pen) so that was my bad. Read the directions, everyone!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-buy">very good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second Fintie cover for a tablet. It protects well, looks nice, stands up to a lot of wear and tear - I had my first one for 3 years and it is still going strong..</p>
