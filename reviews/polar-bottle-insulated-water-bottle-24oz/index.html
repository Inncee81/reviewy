<h5 id="i-suggest-finding-a-different-bottle">I suggest finding a different bottle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I’m not thrilled about his bottle. I was hoping this would work great for keeping my water cool on hot summer bike rides in the Utah desert, especially after reading so many positive reviews. To be fair, the insulation is decent. Don’t expect anything INCREDIBLE, but it is noticeably better than a simple plastic water bottle. Unfortunately that’s the extent of my notable positives with this bottle.Here are my two main gripes:1. The screw-on top worked great for the first month or so, but after that it started to leak. At first I thought the drips were just from excess water that had found its way around the rim and inside the top when I was filling it up, but after carefully drying the top and the rim, a test proved that the bottle does, indeed leak. I have only hand washed it, so it’s not from the bottle warping in the hot dishwasher.2. My experience differs from others as this bottle doesn’t fit in my standard bicycle water bottle holder. Here’s the one I use: Planet Bike 6.2 mm Welded Aluminum Bicycle Water Bottle Cage. Even using this on my road bike and going over very few bumps I’m constantly having to reach down and readjust it so it doesn’t fall.I’ve heard the Camelbak insulated water bottle works great, although I’ve never used one myself. If I were interested in spending more money, I would probably test that one out. At any rate, I don’t recommend this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-the-hype">Not worth the hype</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t keep your liquid contents cold for more than an hour and if you put ice in it I guarantee you it will sweat rivers. The bottle is difficult to drink from as well unless you want to stand there letting it drip the contents into your mouth a half teaspoon at a time you have to suck it out or squeeze the bottle hoping it regains its shape after. Also unless you screw down the lid with all you might it will leak under the lid.</p>

<h5 id="can-t-hold-up-to-arizona-heat">Can&rsquo;t hold up to Arizona heat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed an insulated water bottle that could keep water cold in the most extreme of conditions: over-100-degree-F Saturdays in Phoenix, Arizona. This bottle wasn&rsquo;t up to snuff. Water that came directly out of the refrigerator at the time I filled the bottle is, after just one hour, so warm that you can&rsquo;t tell it was ever cooled in the first place. I even put two ice cubes in with the water once just to see if that would slow down the rise in temperature. No such luck: after an hour in the desert heat, the water was as warm as it always is&ndash;in fact, as warm as it used to be when I was using a plastic water bottle with NO insulation at all. Isn&rsquo;t insulation supposed to make SOME difference? The stuff in this bottle doesn&rsquo;t. The funny thing is that when I fill my Camelbak backpack with <em>uncooled</em> room-temperature water from the tap, and then I fill my Polar bottle with <em>refrigerated</em> water (I always take both the Camelbak and the Polar bottle together on my two-hour bike rides), after an hour or two of riding in the sun, the water in the Camelbak tastes much cooler than the water in the Polar bottle&hellip;even though the latter was originally refrigerated and the former was not! So a backpack that is <em>not</em> expressly designed to keep water cool actually keeps it cooler than an insulated bottle that <em>is</em> designed to keep it cool. I think I&rsquo;d better keep looking for a better bottle. This one failed the test.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-activities-but-not-every-cool">Great for activities but not every cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice concept and nice design but it doesn&rsquo;t really hold in the temp that well. Granted it&rsquo;s better than a regular water bottle but it&rsquo;s nothing compare to a thermo. These are great for activities since they&rsquo;re lightweight but other than that, I&rsquo;d would just go with a metal water bottle if you want to keep your drink cool without shelling out extra money for a thermo water bottle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="insulation-is-unnoticeable">Insulation is unnoticeable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool design, not the best insulation. But for the price I think we all could&rsquo;ve guessed that part. I really don&rsquo;t feel like the insulation provided in this bottle is better than just a normal water bottle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, I was really looking forward to this bottle after reading some of the reviews. Then it was too large for my waist pack and, worse, didn&rsquo;t keep the water all that cold. For a &ldquo;Polar&rdquo; bottle, it was more like a bathtub temperature. I started with filling it entirely with ice, then added water to it. A couple of hours later it was barely cool at all. It didn&rsquo;t seem insulated at all, so I&rsquo;m not sure what that was all about.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-pretty">It&rsquo;s pretty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The design is very pretty, and the bottle itself is lightweight and seals well. However, it really doesn&rsquo;t keep liquids cold for very long. Pretty sure I read in the description somewhere that it performed best if you froze it half full. Under those circumstances&ndash;sure, water will stay cold longer. However, if you don&rsquo;t have time or forget to put it in the freezer, this bottle won&rsquo;t keep things cold much longer than something that is not insulated. I&rsquo;ll stick with a double-wall aluminum bottle (which keeps ice in the water for 8 hours plus).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-insulation">Excellent Insulation.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed an insulating water bottle for bike rides. I&rsquo;ve got an eBike I&rsquo;ve been riding to work. It&rsquo;s great for the 95+ plus days. Up until now I&rsquo;ve been using some free bike bottles we got at an outdoor show. They were okay. The main issue was that they couldn&rsquo;t keep my water warm the whole ride home. I ride about 8 miles in about 30 minutes. So, in 30 minutes my water was warm. I usually started with the bottle topped with ice.First use of this bottle I filled it half way with ice and rode home. When I got home there was still ice in the bottle for probably an hour. Then it melted.Last week I tried another fun experiment. I left the bottle in my hot car all day. While the ice did melt by 3:00 the water was still pretty cool. Definitely drinkable.The only thing I can say negatively about this is that I had the impression that you can freeze this to get cooler water. While you can freeze the bottle it doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything. The bag inside the bottle appears to be only insulating. So, freezing it achieves nothing.My recommended use is just to put ice and water inside it and go riding. It&rsquo;ll keep your water cool for hours.</p>
