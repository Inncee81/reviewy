<h5 id="review-from-an-ex-edge-510-user">Review from an ex-Edge 510 user</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: December 18th, 2015. Much of the issues I stated below still stand, however Garmin has addressed two of them:1) Garmin issued a firmware update that retains the last activity profile chosen, so you no longer need to re-select it on every ride.2) Wireless syncing to the phone is now reliable connection-wise. That said, it still takes a full two to three minutes to upload a ~150kb ride file, which boggles my mind. There must be a way to better optimize the uploading and processing of these things.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Unlike a lot of the reviews here who are upgrading from a different Garmin generation (800, 1000, etc.), I&rsquo;m upgrading from an Edge 510.The Edge 510, as compared to the 500, was flawed in almost every way. The early reviews of the 520 seemed to indicate that many of the 510&rsquo;s issues (terrible screen, slow, bad syncing, dumb UI), were somewhat resolved.So does the 520 deliver? Sort of. In terms of the major issues I had with the 510, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d describe the 520:Terrible screen: the 510, compared to the 500, was almost unusable on any but the sunniest of days. Its viewing angle support was absolutely terrible, so you really had to dial in the angle to ensure you could read it. Any mid-light situation, and you can count on not being able to read it. The 520 is about the same in this regard. The screen has a higher resolution, but you still need the backlight permanently on, and the glare from the glass will make the screen unreadable if you&rsquo;re going under trees, etc. Still baffled at how Garmin thought this would be the best way to present this information.Slow: Not much to say here other than the 520 is definitely faster than the 510. Starting up, saving rides, etc., are all noticeably faster (at least 40-50%). Good improvement here.Bad syncing: Still an issue. Syncing using the Garmin Connect iPhone app is an exercise in frustration. If you want to sync, prepare to restart the app 8-10 times before a successful sync happens. This leads me to believe it&rsquo;s a bug in the lower-level Garmin firmware (or iOS app), not the 520 itself. Speaking of which, the 520 exhibits the same &ldquo;radio reboot&rdquo; issue I have on my 510. Occasionally, my phone, power meter, and HRM will all disconnect at the same time, then bounce back after 10 seconds or so. Annoying.Dumb UI: I hated the touch screen of the 510. But the confusing menu navigation on the 520 might be worse. Throw out any sense of intuition you have. Wherever you think a menu item will be, it&rsquo;s actually somewhere else. Setting up maps or Strava segments is so frustrating, you&rsquo;ll never use them. It&rsquo;s also not possible to set up a &ldquo;default&rdquo; activity profile, or even an option for &ldquo;last used,&rdquo; so make sure you put your most common activity at the top of the list, or you&rsquo;ll be digging through menus every time you ride.Overall, the 520 is definitely an improvement over the train wreck that was the 510, but it&rsquo;s clear Garmin is not listening to usability feedback on the software side, instead focusing on features that make them seem innovative. To release a good product, you really need both.</p>

<h5 id="good-upgrade-from-edge-500">Good Upgrade from edge 500!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using it a few months and no issues. Upgraded from an edge 500.Updating to more detailed maps is cool too get more detail (many videos on YouTube on how to do this) especially useful if you ride singletrack and your particular trail is on the map. Only drawback is you can&rsquo;t pan around the viewing area on the screen. For example, I just went to copper harbor Michigan mountain biking and it was my first time there. It was cool that the trails were displayed on the edge but I couldn&rsquo;t pan around on the screen to see where the trail map went. And if you zoom out it just loses all detail because the screen is so tiny.Other than that I like it. Uploading my rides without having to plug it in like my edge 500 is great too.Phone and text alerts can be useful if you&rsquo;re out riding and expecting an important call, other than that I turn that feature off. After all, who wants to be bothered while riding, it&rsquo;s your time to escape the real world!Display is great so is battery life. I was hesitant after reading some people complain about viewing seen in sunlight, I&rsquo;ve NEVER had a single issue with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 1000 miles with the Edge 520 I think I can give a meaningful review. I&rsquo;m a frequent casual rider in Massachusetts who rides a lot of winding, confusing routes that would be nearly impossible to navigate without some kind of GPS assistance. Overall, the Edge 520 has lived up to expectations. The screen size is just right: large enough to see what I need with a quick glance and still small enough that it doesn&rsquo;t dominate my handlebars. Battery life is enough to support an 8 hour ride with charge to spare, provided that you don&rsquo;t configure the backlight for &lsquo;always on&rsquo;. Sensors seem to be accurate, although there are several seconds of lag on the cadence sensor. The live gradient calculation is even laggier, to the extent that I feel that information screen is unusable. I&rsquo;ve been caught in one lengthy rain storm since I started using it and the wet is no problem at all.Some users have commented on the steep learning curve for the Edge 520 and I agree. I spent about 20 minutes familiarizing myself with the device before setting out on my first ride with it and that was not enough. Once you get past the basic operations and learn to configure screens to your preference the device is very easy to use. Following routes is usually pretty simple, with the caveat that the device is only as helpful as the map you download. The Garmin website doesn&rsquo;t produce correctly formatted TCX files so &ldquo;distance to next turn&rdquo; is not available from files generated there. Ridewithgps.com works like a charm though, and integration with Strava is seamless. You should also be aware that if you go off course the Edge 520 won&rsquo;t guide you back, it just tells you you&rsquo;re off course. It&rsquo;s bread-crumb only and won&rsquo;t give you turn-by-turn directions. It also tends to update the display very slowly after sharp turns, which can be annoying when you need to make a series of quick turns.Setting up the ANT+ sensors and calibration is trivial. I just used auto calibration for the speed sensor and it worked perfectly after only about 150 feet and I haven&rsquo;t even thought about it since then. The batteries they shipped with are cheap though one of them died very quickly on me. Buttons on Edge are well placed and responsive with a meaty &lsquo;click&rsquo;. Once you&rsquo;re on your way you&rsquo;ll mostly use the up and down (screen selector) buttons.Some users have complained about Garmin&rsquo;s default maps, which have virtually no detail at all. There is a way to load your own more detailed maps for free though and they work perfectly. Just google it.My only complaints are:- Somewhat unreliable configuration, such as when I configured my cardio information only to have the device promptly reset all my values to gibberish as soon as I left the screen.- Long lag times on the cadence sensor.- Long lags updating the map display after sharp turns- Long dwell times on the map when riding onto a new street. I don&rsquo;t care what the name of the street is and I REALLY don&rsquo;t need to be shown that information over <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the screen for 30 seconds while covering the distance to the next turn. Just give me the standard map back.- Occasional but somewhat predicatable GPS inaccuracy that I think is a result of local interference. I&rsquo;ve seen it a few times on one of my less frequent routes.- Somewhat limited storage. I&rsquo;d love to be able to store two or three more map zones.</p>
