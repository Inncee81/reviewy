Product Description
This sliding window lock is constructed of diecast and comes in a white painted finish. This lock is DESIGNED FOR USE ON HORIZONTAL VINYL SLIDING WINDOWS, yet it may also work with some vertical sliding (single hung) windows, depending upon the type of vinyl liners and balances used to construct the windows. Note: These locks will fit most all horizontal vinyl sliding windows and some vertical sliding windows, but not all of them. These locks feature an adjustable jaw that has a “vise-like” grip, and they are capable of opening up to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. wide for a secure, non-marring hold on thick vinyl rails. When installing this lock, the cam style locking lever should be rotated hand-tight over the rail or vinyl edge to a sufficient torque prior to locking down the lever. This lock can be adjusted to fit on rail thicknesses ranging from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> in. to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in. thick. This lock can be used as a secondary lock when window is shut and to secure the windows during ventilation. For a larger version of this lock (used on vinyl frame patio sliding doors) see model number U 10547. No tools are required for installation.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-feel-much-more-secure">Works great, feel much more secure</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only option for an intruder appears to be break the window or move on. If a burglar decides to break a window to get in then they would have found their way in regardless. This gives good peace of mind as a deterrent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-putting-bars-on-windows-since-bars-cannot-be">Better than putting bars on windows since bars cannot be &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I put these on the bedroom windows in my kids&rsquo; rooms. I put 2 on each window (1 on each side). I leave about 3 inches so air can flow, but no one can get in. Better than putting bars on windows since bars cannot be removed in case of emergency/fire. I feel so much safer going to sleep and knowing my kids will be there in the morning and no one can get in. I have purchased several more at this point.Here is some helpful info:I use them on double-hung windows myself. So, if you look at the picture of the little lock, you can see a square on top, a turning knob up front, and tucked behind is a piece that moves forward and backward. You take the lock and open that sliding portion by turning the knob. You open it up big enough to slide the &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; of the lock onto the window frame. (See pics) This can attach to any frame as long as the frame is thin enough to fit in the teeth. The teeth open about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;, so if the frame you want to attach to is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; thick or thinner/smaller, then you are good to go. Slide it onto the frame (see pic) and turn knob to tighten. Once you have it good and tight, you push the knob flat and that will secure it even more.Note - make sure to use BOTH locks on a single window. In testing, I placed one lock in a way that it would allow the window to open 3-5 inches. I then &ldquo;pretended&rdquo; I was trying to get in and took the window from the bottom and shoved it up pretty hard. I did this a few times, and there is enough wiggle by going up and down with the window that I can slowly, but loudly, get the lock to inch up until there is enough room for me to climb into the window. However, it is really hard to do that when BOTH locks are used on either side of the window. Having two in place is a pretty secure situation.I also like that I don&rsquo;t have to screw these into anything, which not only damages the window frame but also allows for only one position. These allow you to move them up and down at anytime, or just remove them. Meaning, you can place them in a way to allow the window to open 3&rdquo; or 4&rdquo; or almost all the way open, or almost all the way closed, wherever you want, and you can change it from day to day if you like. Nothing permanent.I love these!Sorry about some of the pics. Amazon would not allow me to flip a couple of them. Hope it still helps.</p>

<h5 id="work-fantastic">Work Fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great! They easily fit into the window channel, install in just seconds and are of a solid metal construction. These are extremely secure on my windows. An intruder would just have to break the window to get past these. Would definitely recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="never-tested-as-a-child-lock-but-works-great-for-my-needs-as-a-security-for-portable-air-conditioning">never tested as a child lock but works great for my needs as a security for portable air-conditioning</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to lock my window after putting in a portable air conditioner. This did exactly what I wanted it to do. It&rsquo;s perfect for the job at hand. I would totally recommend this for anyone wanting to secure a window after putting in a portable air conditioner. I don&rsquo;t know how safe it would be for a child. But I do think that it secures tight enough to be able to keep the child safe from opening a window.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="securely-locks-vinyl-window">Securely locks vinyl window</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this for a window I put the output to an air conditioner up to. It secures the window very well. Each pack comes with two clamps, so you can put one on the bottom and one on top and you are all set. I am on a corner house and used these for a window of a corner room. I feel good at night knowing the window is secure. Great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-little-product">Love this little product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this little product. I originally bought them to secure windows for my air conditioners, but they are so easy to install that I will buy more for all of my windows, since most of the cheap plastic security brackets that came with my vinyl replacement windows have broken.It&rsquo;s great for securing windows to keep kids and pets safe by restricting the height of the open window, also put them halfway so you can leave your windows cracked open in spring/fall and enjoy the cool breeze without worrying about security.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-device">Great Device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They do the job as needed. They tighten up to a point where it is pretty much impossible to move under normal forced entry attempts, so short of somebody hanging on a crowbar or using a car jack the window will not be able to be opened. For their low price, I purchased two for each window I wanted to secure, making those windows immovable. A great low cost and very effective solution. I definately recommend them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, ignore some of the rather illogical reviews about security and such&hellip;.it is what it is&hellip;. Put them up high on the top of the window for kids to small to reach or climb and they work great for a window stop that they can not open further&hellip;..you can not force these open from the outside without making the same effort you would need to to break a window, so while it&rsquo;s not fort knocks, I would feel as safe as I would with just a locked window&hellip;..Put one on the top and bottom window sills if you are that worried about it&hellip;.You do need to set the tension right tho&hellip;.don&rsquo;t soft ball it&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-the-best-to-prevent-break-in">Not the best to prevent break in</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not the best to prevent break in, but you would at least know if someone was trying to knock it off. I just want a little warning, can take care of the rest.</p>
