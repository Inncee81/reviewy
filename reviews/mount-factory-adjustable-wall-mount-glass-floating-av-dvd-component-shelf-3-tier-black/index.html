<h5 id="simple-and-inexpensive-storage-solution">Simple and inexpensive storage solution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works fine. I do wish that the back housing had more room to accommodate the various utility cords associated with the many accessories you&rsquo;ll use. I have just a router, Xbox with Kinect and an Amazon Fire TV box. But with just these 3 I have 9 wires to try and hide behind the housing but they don&rsquo;t all fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-looking-but-a-zillion-little-parts-not-easy-to-assemble">Nice LOOKING, but&hellip;. A zillion little parts. Not easy to assemble!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The package arrived promptly and were well packed and shipped on time with no damage to the package or the product.I found these to LOOK very nice once I went through 6 degrees of Hell trying to get them assembled.My components DO fit- I dunno about the people saying that theirs didn&rsquo;t. The only issue I ran into with size was that my HDMI cable on my Direct tv box needs back clearance and had to extend out a little more, but it still fit. What do you guys that said the shelves were too small have? Monster components? *<strong>The shelves fit <em>inside</em> of the outer diameter of the components</strong>* - In other words, there is no outer shelf showing.I think that makes it better because its actually more secured onto the shelf that way and it looks better. It isn&rsquo;t like you will have any shelving SHOWING but the components should still &ldquo;seat onto&rdquo; the shelf just fine!I would not use the shelves for wired gaming stuff because there are not ridges that could stop it from sliding off if there was pull and they would easily pull off UNLESS the &ldquo;legs&rdquo; on the unit seated over the shelf, but even that could be a risk. I don&rsquo;t find that they would easily come off otherwise though, and I trust the shelf to hold my stuff.I mounted them on a board and <em>the board fell</em> (no fault of the unit!- ALL MY FAULT!) and one of the shelves broke on hard impact, but I can still just re-adjust and use the 2 surviving shelves that are still intact.2 stars is BECAUSE it is a zillion little parts and the directions SUCK. No step by step written, just pictures. I had issues getting it put together, IT TOOK A LOT LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE. I am pretty mechanically inclined- Had I not been I really don&rsquo;t think I could have figured it out. So if you aren&rsquo;t mechanically inclined somewhat, don&rsquo;t buy these or get help with them. Also, you may need a magnifying glass to &ldquo;read&rdquo; the pictures to the point of being able to see detail (the little tiny parts) drawn in them.And they may as well not even bother with the stupid cord-hide thinggies. They are a good CONCEPT but they are pretty flimsy and I have no idea HOW they actually work to HIDE the cords. FRUSTRATING! I WILL figure it out later on&hellip; So the picture shows 2 shelves (1 broke- my fault) and the UNHIDDEN cords. And it looks unlevel because I took the pic in a stupid position.INSTRUCTIONS need to be PRINTED and more PRECISE. You CAN look on youtube if you have internet and the know how about finding something (some [mostly older] people do not have a clue), but YOU SHOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE TO!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is great! It&rsquo;s exactly what I expected. Would have given it a five but shelves need to be a bit larger (maybe an inch) or needs to come further away from the wall. It came in two days which I thought was an error when the shipper said it but it arrived on time. Instructions needs a bit to be desired but you can follow them because there aren&rsquo;t many parts. Would definitely order again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-need-a-shelf-and-don-t-want-to-buy-furniture">If you need a shelf and don&rsquo;t want to buy furniture-</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I wall mounted a TV in a small guest bedroom and needed a place to place a dvd player and other controls, this is what I added. It seems to be adequate for the purpose but I can&rsquo;t say how much weight it could take. I think my blue-ray player is less than a pound total and it hold it well. The plastic attachments on either side are a bit flimsy so don&rsquo;t over-tighten the screws that hold them on. I was concerned about them slipping so I tightened them pretty hard and the plastic cracked on every screw. The top and bottom end covers are supposed to allow the cords to go behind to be semi-concealed but my Amazon installer didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-glass-shelf">Great little glass shelf</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this shelf for my Mac mini, it fits great with room to put my keyboard and mouse next to it. Installation was self explanatory and the instructions were clear. It&rsquo;s a very nice shelf for the price. The brace part of the shelf is aluminum with black plastic cord keepers on the side. The shelf is black glass and very nice. Highly recommend this shelf!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wish-the-shelves-were-bigger">Wish the shelves were bigger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The shelves are way to small, they are not long enough or deep enough. Once you plug in the cables in the back of the components they push the component even more forward , leaving them hanging off the shelf. The shelves can be adjusted up and down but not front to back. Very nice mount, easy to assemble and nice looking. Measure your components before buying . Remember if your component is 4&rdquo; deeper than the shelf, it will hang off the front 6&rdquo; after you plug in the cables.</p>

<h5 id="the-adjustable-wall-mount-is-perfect-for-what-i-wanted-it-for">The adjustable wall mount is perfect for what I wanted it for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The adjustable wall mount is perfect for what I wanted it for. Its small, but strong enough to hold a Cable or Satellite box. I use it to hold my Roku 3 and Dish network Joey box, both of them are very small boxes the Roku 3 being a lot smaller. I was lucky to find a stud where I needed it, so my installation is very strong. I&rsquo;m happy with my purchase and if you are looking for a nice and small glass shelve, this one is a very good choice. It is a little bit smaller than my older Samsung Blue-Ray player.</p>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for what I needed</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cool-idea-but-the-fasteners-to-hold-the-shelf-aren-t">Cool idea but the fasteners to hold the shelf aren&rsquo;t &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool idea but the fasteners to hold the shelf aren&rsquo;t the best. I bought this to hold my Xbox one and anytime I move it the shelf pulls out. Also it&rsquo;s kind of small for the Xbox.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheep build, unsteady, can&rsquo;t handle a full size DVD player.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-seller">Great seller</h5>

<p>Great item shipped very very fast</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="glass-with-class">Glass with Class</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It does exactly what it was designed to do. It&rsquo;s functional and has allowed to me to clean up and organize the component and cable clutter everyone sees.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-made-well">Sturdy, made well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Made very well, sturdy, it was a great buy and easy to assemble.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-want-i-wanted">Just want I wanted!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My expectations were met with this! Held Xbox 1 DVD and another continent. Would have loved another shelf yet. Person installed was going to go him and order one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>sent back to many small pieces to put together</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Good Product!</p>

<p>worked just how i thought it would, very elegant looking for the price.</p>
