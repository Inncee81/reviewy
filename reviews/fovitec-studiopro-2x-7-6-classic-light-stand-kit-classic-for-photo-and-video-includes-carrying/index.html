<h5 id="tripod-for-htc-vive">tripod for HTC Vive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these to use for the IR lighthouse units on the HTC Vive. They work perfectly for this purpose, very stable, no wobble at all. They are sturdy and seem to be built well. Very small foot print on the floor so if you are tight on space these will work well, if you have more space you can widen them for more stability but even at max height they do not move at all. Even with the slight vibration these boxes generate. Coupled with the tripod ball head bracket and it&rsquo;s a complete solution for your VR space.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-carpet-floor-and-these-are-totally-sturdy-once-these-were-set-up-and-my-room">I have carpet floor and these are totally sturdy. Once these were set up and my room &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly for Vive base stations! I have carpet floor and these are totally sturdy. Once these were set up and my room calibrated, I haven&rsquo;t had to move or adjust them once and haven&rsquo;t had any issues with tracking in VR. The vibration from the light houses is tangible if you actually put a hand on the pole, but otherwise doesn&rsquo;t affect tracking and is not visible or audible. Footprint may be an issue for those with very small or standing-room-only play areas, but otherwise I think light stands like these are overall the best option for Vive mounting solutions; they&rsquo;re tall, sturdy, portable, able to set up in an instant, and don&rsquo;t look bad or out of place either. As for this specific one compared to others, I liked that these came with a bag, and it&rsquo;s also very smart of them to recognize a different target market in bundling the tripods with the ball head mounts for VR. Props.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-and-a-nice-bag">Good quality and a nice bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought some inexpensive light stands on Amazon in the past, and the quality was definitely lacking - although they &lsquo;worked&rsquo;. This time, I still wasn&rsquo;t looking to break the bank on a set of light stands - but opted to go with a little higher quality option. I am not disappointed! The bag is very nice, MUCH better quality than the one that came with the el-cheapo stand I bought before (not from the same seller) and the quality of the stands themselves is MUCH more solid. Definitely will be used!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-small-stand-for-ringlight-or-other-options-quite-durable">Great small stand for ringlight or other options. Quite durable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I reviewed this previously, but I guess I didn&rsquo;t. I needed something to hold my ring light on a table as my larger stand was just too tall. I have an 18 inch ring light so it can be quite top heavy, but I position the legs of this stand so that it keeps it balanced and I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with toppling over. This thing is sturdy, I&rsquo;m very impressed with how well it is made and how durable it is. I use it several times a week for hours on end and it doesn&rsquo;t have any issues. If you are looking for a small table top stand, I highly suggest this one as it is affordable and really holds up well. I&rsquo;m impressed for sure. I do suggest that you not put it on a slippery surface. I place it on a table top that is not slippery and it stays, but on my table that is slightly slippery, it can slide. Otherwise, it works really well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-with-a-really-convienent-carrying-bag-included-perfect-for-the-vive-vr-system">Great product with a really convienent carrying bag included, Perfect for the Vive VR system!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product shiped in a box the size of the bag with the tripods themselves safely secured inside the bag in their own individual boxes. The Vive light box attachments outside the bag. Setup was extremely easy and the tripods seems stable and allow me to angle the Vive&rsquo;s two lightboxes as easily as the original mounts did. This product makes placing the Vive VR headset&rsquo;s two light boxes very easy and allows for easy mobility if you ever want to travel with the equpiment or move it from room to room. A lot nicer than the headset&rsquo;s included wall mount. At the price I paid($44) I would call this a must have for any Vive owner!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-mini-miracle-light-stand">A Mini-Miracle Light Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this little bugger. It is made of quality materials. The top part of the stand is spring loaded which is great for extending and retracting the stand. This mini light stand is the perfect size for lighting muslins from a low angle. I am using it to create a white background using a broad light. It has a firm and steady foundation and holds my light exactly where I need it. If you need to support a light, slider dolly, or any other accessory at a low angle this is the stand for you.</p>

<h5 id="these-tripods-seem-to-be-very-good-quality-and-quite-rugged-enough-for-their-designed">These tripods seem to be very good quality, and quite rugged enough for their designed &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These tripods seem to be very good quality, and quite rugged enough for their designed task. You still don&rsquo;t want to have anyone crashing into (or tripping over) them, but that&rsquo;s just as much for the protection of the equipment that you have mounted on them.My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that when I originally opened the package, I didn&rsquo;t immediately see the ball heads, an I thought that I had received the wrong unit, but the heads were bagged separately in the bottom of the carrying bag.FWIW: I am choosing to store the tripods inside the little cardboard boxes, inside the carrying bag. That way they don&rsquo;t scratch each other up during transport.Bottom line: These are good tripods. If you need good tripods, get these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-i-have-to-say-these-tripods-are-really-good-i-always-bought-tripods-that-had-legs-that">&hellip; and I have to say these tripods are really good. I always bought tripods that had legs that &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for the HTC Vive but I also used to be a short film hobbyist and I have to say these tripods are really good. I always bought tripods that had legs that were too spread out and it was just to big and not really good for what I wanted. I wish I had a debit card when I was younger so I could have bought myself these. I also love the fact that it came with a bag to carry them. My first tripod didn&rsquo;t even have a bag and my second one had a small bag. With this bag I can fit the two tripods and several other things I want. Definitely would recommend this. It is also a lot taller than the average tripod. Haven&rsquo;t tried it with my Canon Vixia yet but I&rsquo;m sure it is also sturdy. I would recommend to also buy those thing that go at the top of the tripod, the one that&rsquo;s on the htc vive version of this, or just buy the HTC Vive version as it comes with those things I&rsquo;m talking about to adjust the angle of the camera to any angle you want as it doesn&rsquo;t come with that on the tripod.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-price-too">Good price too</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these for the HTC Vive. So I can set up my play area in whatever room I want. Good price too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very portable and solid construction. Exactly what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-htc-vive-lighthouses">Perfect for HTC Vive Lighthouses.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for mounting the HTC vive lighthouses. I didn&rsquo;t want to always have the lighthouses up because they can be a bit of an eye sore, these stands make it super easy to set up&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="everything-about-this-purchase-was-five-stars">Everything about this purchase was five stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Incredibly satisfied with the quality, build, shipping speed and overall purchase of these light stands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-he-best-purchase-i-ever-made">This was he best purchase I ever made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was he best purchase I ever made! The price is amazing ! The stands are honestly high quality! Truly recommend. I use it for a 18 inch ring light and it hold up perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-have-for-mounting-htc-vive-tracking-cubes-for-those-that-don-t-want-to-drill-holes-in-the-walls">Must have for mounting HTC VIVE tracking cubes for those that don&rsquo;t want to drill holes in the walls.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well with my new HTC VIVE system. Love the portable aspect in case I want to move the system around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-other-places-are-selling-for-double-the-price">Good product. Other places are selling for double the price.</h5>
