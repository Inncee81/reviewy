<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="well-made-as-described">Well-made as described</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are well-made as described, the black coating looks adequate which is my favorite color. Aluminum carabiner is on one end and stainless steel ring on the other end, this lanyard is elastic and it recovers to its original length instantly under large force, but I am not sure if it could bear heavy duty stuffs. I am a fishing angler, also forgetful as well. That’s too bad, I lost a lot of expensive fishing gears and spent too much unnecessary money on them. So I desperately need a portable tool to attach these expensive fishing tackles. I searched on the internet for a long time, and found this item. It is really amazing that they are quite helpful to me, although they are cheap and looks weak. I use them to my fishing plier, fishing hook remover and gripper and other fishing equipments that easy to lose. Unbelievable, they still look quite well after a long time use. They are fine for me and really what I need. Maybe they could withstand for a longer time. I will purchase them agai</p>

<h5 id="absolutely-love-this-fantastic-product-to-be-honest">Absolutely LOVE this fantastic product to be honest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely LOVE this fantastic product to be honest. Have used it a lot and still feels like it&rsquo;s brand new over my expectation. There are several advantages I can figure out and willing to enjoy it with you.ELASTIC. The lanyards are made of plastic stretchy cable cord, a durable material with a great stretch range. With an excellent elastic ability, this small coil can be stretched from 10” to 40&rdquo; and recovers about 90 % of its original length immediately. It springs back to its original shape quickly in a minute as tested by stretching the lanyard to its full extension. As flexible as description.WELL-CRAFTED. This lanyard looks small but with excellent quality. Built with PVC material, it is durable for use and could bear large force. It is also great with aluminum carabiner so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about rust. Small and lightweight features make it no burden with you.FUNCTIONAL. Actually an awesome tool, has all the necessities to have everything u need for fishing among man</p>

<h5 id="just-durable-and-reliable">Just durable and reliable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Am an accountant by profession, however, when am free from work, love fishing. I started finishing when I was kid and remember the days when I used to go to fish with my dad. If you love fishing like me, then you definitely know the importance of having a reliable fishing safety rope. For a long period of time, was frustrated with the safety fishing rope that I used. They broke easily even when not under immense pressure and could not last for long.However one day when I went to fish with my friendly, he advised me to purchase YOGAYET fishing lanyards safety rope. I followed his advice (although I didn’t have much expectations) and I ordered it from Amazon. The moment I opened the box I knew that is what I was looking for. This safety rope has flexible spring shaped rope that provides maximum flexibly when I fish. In addition to that this safety rope enables me to use other fishing tool easily, a factor that provides convenience. I thank my friend for recommending YAGAYET fishing</p>

<h5 id="a-handy-tool-for-worth-trying">A handy tool for worth trying</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These lanyards are such handy products. My husband clip this onto his keys and then clip it onto his belt. So he knows whether they will fall out of pocket whenever he is doing farm work. It provide a security for him that he is not gonna lose his keys because we have had that before. This set comes with eight in one package and the carabiners are very sturdy so you will not have to worry about those breaking suddenly. We have been using them since we received them. They still look well as new ones. I believe it will last for a long time. Over all a handy tool for often use.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-a-must-have">These are a must have.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these to teather my dog whistle to my hunting vest and hook remover to my waders. The clips are nice and the lanyard holds it coils. There are many uses for an outdoorsman.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-short-kayak-anchoring">Good for short kayak anchoring.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t heavy duty, and they aren&rsquo;t super long. But for attaching things at less than 3 feet in my Kayak they are very handy. I think they will last long enough to be well worth the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="convenient-for-attaching-them-to-my-fishing-vests-or-boat">convenient for attaching them to my fishing vests or boat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not so heavy as I expected. and still a great item! I used it for my small gadgets, and convenient for attaching them to my fishing vests or boat. I could keep them close to me. They work fine for some light applications and quite useful for kayak anglers!</p>
