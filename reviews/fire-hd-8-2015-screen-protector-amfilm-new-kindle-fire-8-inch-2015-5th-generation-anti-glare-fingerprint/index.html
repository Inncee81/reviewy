Warranty:
30 days Money Back Guarantee
Lifetime Replacement Warranty</p>

<p>Note: The Matte material may produce a pixellation of the screen clarity, as this is the natural effect created by the Matte (anti-glare) frosted texture.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="really-nice-look-and-feel-and-was-one-of-the-easier-installs-i-ve-done">Really nice look and feel, and was one of the easier installs I&rsquo;ve done.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put on my fair share of screen protectors over the years, so I&rsquo;ve had plenty of practice. I found installing this one pretty easy, and the instructions clear. I especially like the little rubber bands that help you place the film perfectly before you attach the tape hinges. That was a good idea and helped make it easier to do. I was able to apply the first one flawlessly. I don&rsquo;t like the reflective screens (which is why I purchase the anti-glare, but I use that feature to rotate the device under a good light to see from all angles if there&rsquo;s any dust there. And then clean, clean, clean and tape, tape, tape before installing. If you&rsquo;re in a dusty room, that may take a lot of work, but worth it.The film itself is matt finish, and is nice and clear. It keeps the sharp screen looking sharp, but without all that reflection. I&rsquo;ve had it on just a few hours, but it really seems to help with finger prints. It will have to be cleaned once in a while, but not as often as the unprotected Kindle Fire does.It also seems to respond to touch really well under the film. There&rsquo;s no problem there.I&rsquo;ll be testing it out for quite a while, but it&rsquo;s started out really well and I really like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="install-in-a-steam-shower-room">Install in a steam shower room?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with every screen protector I have bought to date, for my iPhones and previous Kindle Fire, have been painful to put on. This one was easier, because of their approach, in being able to slide the protector on. They do recommend that it be put on in the steam of a hot shower room. While I did not do this, a version of the small &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; I have always gotten still did appear, but I was able to squeeze most of them out. I consider this a reflection of my not following their installation tip and will redo it, when I find I need to. I have had this for quite a while and nothing about my initial install bothers me, in any lighting conditions. I would buy this product again, for myself or as a gift.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hit-and-miss">Hit and miss.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although they&rsquo;re decent, sturdy screen protectors, why the complicated instructions? It&rsquo;s recommended that you apply the screen protector in the bathroom after running hot water. The instructions state the steam will lessen the amount of bubbles accumulated while installing a protector. Is that really a practical suggestion? You&rsquo;d think steam and electronics are like oil and water. Who has the time or wants so much bother. I applied the first protector and had to remove it because there were way too many bubbles, even after cleaning the screen with a cloth and using the device included to eliminate bubbling. I tried and failed. There&rsquo;s got to be an easier way to install a screen protector. Protector #2 is still inside the package. It&rsquo;s way too aggravating to install them or maybe I&rsquo;m a simpleton.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="takes-the-shine-and-glare-off-the-screen">Takes the shine and glare off the screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this matte screen protector! I was glad it came with two of them because after I went through the steps to apply the first one to the screen, I accidently pulled it off when I was removing the last plastic sheet from it. Makes my Fire so much easier to read now that the &lsquo;shine&rsquo; is gone!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-essential">an essential</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For me installing a screen protector on a device before using is an essential. My use of screen protectors goes back to the old Sony CLIE SL-10 pda, yes I have used many screen protectors over time since then. This screen film was easy to instal and does the intended job and does it well. I can&rsquo;t say anything more than that. You can&rsquo;t ask more of a screen protector.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-had-two-kindles-to-place-screen-protectors-on-and">I had two kindles to place screen protectors on and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had two kindles to place screen protectors on and followed the instructions step by step.Don&rsquo;t believe the marketing that &ldquo; Simple installation - attaches smoothly with self-adhering surface, leaves no residue when removed &ldquo;. Someone who does these all the time&hellip;.maybe&hellip;.but not a person that has only done this once before 5 years ago. That attempt had to be corrected by an electronics store person who does this process often.Yes, there is self adhering surface, but the claim that leaves no residue when removed is not the case. I could not get the bubbles out even when working in the bathroom with the hot water on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dust-free-environment-is-a-must">Dust free environment is a must!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read a lot of reviews before I purchased the film. I have decided after I placed the film on my tablet that most of the negative reviews must be from operator error. I did have issues with properly placing the film the first go around. I did have a ton of bubbles, BUT, I didn&rsquo;t get rid of all the dust. The second go around, again I had some bubbles. Upon close inspection, I saw specs of fuzz and dust. I lifted parts of the film up and picked off the fuzz/ dust with scotch tape. After that trick, I was good to go. Instructions were clear, and I am happy with the product. My only complaint is that I&rsquo;d like to see the price of the sheets to go down a little bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nothing-but-bubbles">Nothing but bubbles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry guys. But I ruined both trying to get the bubbles out.Watched the video twice. Read the directions 4 times.I&rsquo;m sure its just me, but there has to be a better way</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-fit-the-fire-8">Doesn&rsquo;t fit the fire 8</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen protector is just a hair too big for the screen so even when i finally got the thing placed perfectly straight, there was a huge airpocket down the side of the screen&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-only-thing-that-i-do-not-like-is-the-fact-that-the-protector-does-not-stick">The only thing that I do not like is the fact that the protector does not stick &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted the Screen protector to of course keep it safe. The only thing that I do not like is the fact that the protector does not stick to the screen at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cuts the reflections and allows me to use my kindle even when my migraines are bothering me (as long as I dim the screen)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product">nice product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice product but I had a hard time with the bubbles</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok">ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It does what it says&mdash;makes it possible to read outside. Not as easy to put on as it says. I still have some bubbles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-it-bubbled-like-crazy-it-got-super-flimsy-after-taking-it">and it bubbled like crazy. It got super flimsy after taking it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got 2 in the package. the first one I tried to put on my kindle got scratched somehow. I am not at all sure why. It was then thrown away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Could not get the screen to attach in the corners,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>went on pretty easily and had no bubbles</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t really this protector as it makes the screen look foggy!</p>
