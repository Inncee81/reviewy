<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-small-wire-installations">Great for small wire installations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice item to help with smaller wire installs. I have had no problems with these sticking, but then again I take the proper steps to prep the area also. What I mean is that you have to take the proper time to prep the area and product to ensure success. First, initially clean the area. Second, clean with alcohol. Third, wear nylon or latex gloves so you don&rsquo;t get skin oils on the area or sticker. Finally, ambient temperature and/or temp of application area should be over 70°F (24°C). If you take time to prep the area, you should have no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="surprisingly-good-product">Surprisingly good product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For being so small, MAN these things work well! I managed to put even my largest cords through them, and they stick to both metal, plastic and wood with ease. I would definitely purchase these again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-cable-management-clips">Quality Cable Management Clips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I picked up these cable clips in order to route my cables behind my monitors for a clean look. eBoot has produced a quality solution for my cable management.The specific product I am reviewing is linked below.eBoot 100 Pieces Adhesive Cable Clips Drop Clamp Cable Tie Holder for Car, Office and HomeFor starters, this product comes packaged in a clear plastic bag. The bag has a black eBoot logo in the corner and contains 100 of the cable clips.Aesthetically, these are pretty stealthy cable clips. They have a fairly small footprint, but can be mounted strategically to mount any length cable. On the top, there is the locking mechanism for locking the cables in place. There is a thicker outer band, as well as an inner band that is cut in order to secure smaller cables. The overall feel and mechanism remind me of zip ties, although the clip can be undone if you choose. On the bottom, there is some self adhesive in order to mount the cable clip in the location of your choosing. Overall, these cable clips look pretty decent.For build quality, these clips are constructed fairly well. The black plastic material again reminds me of standard zip ties. The self adhesive works wonderfully and keeps my cable clips right where I have left them. I&rsquo;ve had my cables routed using these clips for a few weeks and there have been no issues whatsoever.For ease of use, these cable clips are easy to mount and route cables through. Although the inner band of the clip is nice for smaller cables, it didn&rsquo;t work so well for my thicker cables. I personally cut out the inner band of the clip and they worked perfectly for my needs. I have absolutely no complaints about these clips.Overall, these are excellent clips to help clean up your cables. Their sleek aesthetic, decent build quality, extreme ease of use, and convenient form factor work perfectly for my use case. With a little ingenuity for thicker cables, these clips get the job done without any issue. I can definitely recommend these cable clips to anyone looking to clean up their rat&rsquo;s nest!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-needs">Perfect for my needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really cool and easy to use for cables in the car. If you take the device and the cables out you can leave them in place for the next time you put it back in the car. You get a lot of them too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-and-the-glue-is-heat-resilient">Great price and the glue is heat resilient.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These babies hold up to the Florida heat very well. I have these to organize the wires for my Dashcam and my Bluetooth dongle in my all black Mini Cooper and even with the car becoming hotter than a sauna, these have absolutely refused to become unstuck. They&rsquo;re great too because they click in and lock the wires into place, so the wires don&rsquo;t shift position easily unless they&rsquo;re unlocked.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-small-great-for-phone-cables-bad-for-cables-5mm-thick-and-up">VERY small. Great for phone cables. Bad for cables 5mm thick and up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These clips are very very tiny. They work great with USB cables, phone chargers, and ethernet cables. But for anything larger they don&rsquo;t work. Granted I knew they weren&rsquo;t going to work with some of the very large cables I have but I have a good few 5mm cables that these don&rsquo;t work with either. The clips have prongs on the inside that keep cables tight whether they are smaller or larger. But the problem is when the cables are 5mm, the prongs take up too much space in the loop. So if you cut out the prongs (a very annoying and slow process) you can get 5mm cables to work. So for larger cables like VGA and some HDMI cables, 120v power cables, COAX cables, etc, it does not work.Also, it is seen commonly bundled with VELCRO Brand One Wrap Thin Ties, Black, 8 x <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-Inch, 100 Count (91140) . I would just like to point out that these two items do not fit together. So it doesn&rsquo;t help much buying them together as you cant loop lots of cords together with these clips because they are for the most part only able to fit one cable per clip.Letting the adhesive set before applying weight makes them work great strength wise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="affordable-wire-guides">Affordable wire guides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are really handy for organizing the wires under my desk. They stick very well, and they clip shut easily. They work best with smaller cords. They will hold bigger cords in place (like my surge protector), but they won&rsquo;t be able to close around it. For instance, I could put one mac charger cord through it with some wiggle room, but if I tried 2 mac charger cords at once, it wouldn&rsquo;t clip shut. They&rsquo;re not super attractive, but you&rsquo;re not paying for cute. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-in-love-with-these-and-the-short-velcro-strips">I am in love with these and the short Velcro strips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am in love with these and the short Velcro strips. It seems like all IT people just leave wires everywhere going every which way, I like to conquer a little of the chaos to make it somewhat easier when something needs to be worked on or if someone doesn&rsquo;t want to trip over cords everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>too small that I can&rsquo;t even use them for TV cable. they are for ethernet cable maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-them">Love Them.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work great! They don&rsquo;t come off in the extreme heat!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kind-of-meh-don-t-buy-for-trying-to-obtain-clean-90-degree-bends">Kind of&hellip; meh. Don&rsquo;t buy for trying to obtain clean 90 degree bends.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really weak adhesive. Even with a LOT of them trying to hold down a single strip of 14 gage speaker wire, reasonably clean 90 degree turns were impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Big fan</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-clips-note-too-small-for-coaxial-cable">Great clips! Note, too small for coaxial cable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great clips for wires/cables on the smaller size. Note that these will note fit your typical coaxial cable but work great otherwise!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install, hard to remove.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="alright">Alright</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This does what it says it will, average at best. Only one or two thin wires fit at a time and the adhesive tape isn&rsquo;t too strong.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-loved-these-little-things-at-first">i loved these little things at first</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i loved these little things at first, but soon, they started to come off with barely any tension at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>perfect for small jobs. Like a lot and use a lot. Thamk you</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent clips. Adhesive is very strong.</p>
