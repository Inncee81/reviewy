<h5 id="the-gearvr-was-better-than-i-expected-after-trying-the-htc-vive">The GearVR was better than I expected after trying the HTC Vive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The GearVR was better than I expected after trying the HTC Vive. My kids really enjoy playing VR as well, and the only real complaint is that chromecasting the screen isn&rsquo;t very intuitive (before putting on the goggles, you have to open the oculus app, click on &ldquo;More&rdquo;, then click the Chromecast icon to stream the screen), and then you have a red dot on the GearVR screen when you cast the screen to a TV, which is a little distracting especially in the pointer in the game isn&rsquo;t very bright.But other than that complaint, I just wish there were more games in the app store! Our favorites are Smash Hit, Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes, and SWAT academy.READ MORE</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only ever tried the $20 headsets before so I was blown away with gear VR! My only complaint is a lack of good games and a lot of times you will have to pay for a game before you find out it sucks. Telltale needs to get on the VR trolly. Walking dead and Sam and Max would be perfect in VR land!READ MORE</p>

<p>Just got the Samsung Gear VR w/Controller (Note8 Edition) today works very similarly to the last model though it&rsquo;s just a tad sharper. honestly I just got it since I loved watching movies on my old one that I used with my note 5 and S7 then got the note 8 and needed a new one. I like that it has a removable multipurpose jack so if you get this it is backwards compatible. it has a micro usb and a usb c jack you choose which you need.A tip for those that love watching movies run them through handbrake (a free video program) to get them to a proper size and codec so the phone doesn&rsquo;t get hot!READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been fighting getting into VR, mostly cause my eyes don&rsquo;t do well with 3D videos. I had some money to spend, and this had good reviews, so I went for it. SOOOOO glad I did! This thing is awesome! The video is so clear, and it runs so smooth on my new Note 8. The oculus app has so many awesome videos to watch and apps to play, you will not get bored anytime soon. Motion sickness? Non existent! I don&rsquo;t know how it counters that, but it does. The controller is comes with works really well too, it&rsquo;s better than the Nintendo remotes in terms of accuracy and response. The Netflix app is absolutely killer as well!All in all, such a great buy, so glad I did it. Highly recommend!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="samsung-gear-vr-galaxy-note-8-edition">Samsung Gear VR - Galaxy Note 8 Edition</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off by giving a brief overview of what types of VR headsets currently exist (if you are familiar with these and just want to read specifically about the Gear VR then scroll down to the section titled &ldquo;Gear VR&rdquo;).There are many Virtual Reality headsets in the market right now (Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, etc.). These typically fit into two categories: tethered vs. mobile.Tethered: Devices built from the ground up for VR. As such, they typically have a higher quality image than mobile VR headsets but require a somewhat powerful machine to wirelessly connect and &ldquo;tether&rdquo; to in order to operate (such as a PC or gaming system). These are also typically more expensive and can range from $300 - $800 dollars.Mobile: Imagine quality relies on the specs of the phone or device you place inside it. Because of this the image isn&rsquo;t nearly as high quality as the tethered devices but that&rsquo;s not to say they aren&rsquo;t impressive and immersive. These are typically cheaper than the tethered units ranging from $13 to $150. Mobile VR headsets are also incredibly convenient and portable (normally all you need is your phone and your headset). Another feature that isn&rsquo;t typically mentioned with these is that devices (such as the Gear VR) have a phone cast feature that allows you to use virtually all of your phone apps and games through the headset (including texting, Spotify, Super Mario Run, internet, Kodi, Youtube, etc.).Gear VR: I used this with my new Galaxy Note 8 and enjoyed the heck out of this little headset. For something similar to a face mask it is quite comfortable and lightweight. One thing to note however is that if you are hot or sweaty the lenses can fog up from your body heat getting trapped in the headset. You can try to take it off and wipe the lenses but it will just continue to fog until your face isn&rsquo;t giving off as much heat (so it might be best just to give yourself a couple minutes to cool down).Though the Gear VR comes with a touchpad remote, many games in the oculus store require a Bluetooth wireless gamepad controller to use so make sure you factor that into your budget if you are planning to use the headset for gaming. At the reasonable $130 price point, the image quality impressed me; the pixels of the phone are still somewhat visible but this may continue to be improved as phone screen resolutions continue to evolve. Note: the phone can still be charged while using the device by plugging in a charger to the charging port (USB - C) located at the bottom of the headset.Overall, I found this nifty headset to be a great product at a great price. At a considerably cheaper price point than the HTC Vive and the PlayStation VR, its features and quality did not fail to impress. You haven&rsquo;t watched a movie until you watch one through a VR headset with high quality around-ear headphones. It&rsquo;s like having the best seats in a theater but without the hefty ticket price - all from the comfort of your couch/bed/bus/airplane/car! Bonus points for being able to watch movies in bed next to someone without disturbing them.Pros:• Relatively inexpensive for a VR headset• Can be used on-the-go with your phone• Comes with wireless controller• Can charge your phone through the headset (with cable)• With Samsung PhoneCast you can operate most of your phone apps and games through the headset• Sleek, comfortable, and lightweightCons• Lenses can fog up from heat• Many games require the purchase of an additional Bluetooth game controller• Image quality isn’t as refined as higher end VR headsets (such as the PlayStation VR and Oculus Rift)• Only works with Samsung flagship phones (with the Galaxy Note 8 requiring its own specific edition of the headset due to its size)READ MORE</p>
