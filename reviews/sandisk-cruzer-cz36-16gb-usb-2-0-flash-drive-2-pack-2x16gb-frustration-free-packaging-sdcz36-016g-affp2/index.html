<p>Capacity:16 GB - 2 pack  |  Package Type:Frustration-Free Packaging
With USB ports popping up everywhere you look, you need a simple and reliable way to store and share your photos, videos and music on the fly. The Cruzer USB Flash Drive is your answer. Because it works with virtually any computer or electronic device with a USB slot, this flash drive lets you leave your laptop at home but still take your vast amounts of content with you to share with family and friends. And to make sure all your important files are protected, SanDisk offers the free SecureAccess software download, which adds a private, password-protected folder to your drive. Whether you need to transport your latest MP3 downloads, vacation videos, or your college thesis, the Cruzer USB Flash Drive offers secure, portable storage that you can trust.</p>

<p>Innovative capless design exposes the USB connector via a convenient slider.</p>

<p>The Cruzer USB Flash Drive is a fast and reliable flash storage device for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10+ and Linux machines.</p>

<p>Convenient Storage and Portability
With USB ports on computers, to new ports popping up on cars, DVD players, TVs, photo frames, and more, the need for a fast and reliable way to share your digital content on a moment&rsquo;s notice is greater than ever.</p>

<p>The Cruzer USB Flash Drive meets that need. This reliable flash drive fits in the palm of your hand and gives you the storage capacity you need to store and transfer up to 16 GB of data.</p>

<p>While the drive is optimized for laptops and devices with USB 2.0 port, it is backwards compatible with older devices that have USB 1.1 ports, so you can be assured of near universal compatibility.</p>

<p>View Videos Without Extra Software or Setup
With the Cruzer USB Flash Drive, you can transfer your favorite video from one device to another easily and conveniently, without any additional software or setup. The drive offers drag-and-drop convenience, which means you can simply drag the files from your device onto your Cruzer Flash drive, or vice versa, without any steps.</p>

<p>Transferring video files from computer to computer, or from your drive to a USB-enabled DVD player, is incredibly simple. Drag your video files from your PC to your USB flash drive and then plug the drive into your DVD player – or even your USB-enabled TV – and sit back to enjoy the show.</p>

<p>Smart, Stylish Design for Ease of Use
With a capless design that exposes the USB connector via a convenient slider, the Cruzer USB Flash Drive looks just as great as it performs.</p>

<p>When you plug the Cruzer USB Flash Drive into your USB-enabled device, a glowing, amber-colored LED alerts you that the drives are ready for reading or writing data. This LED rapidly pulses when data is being transferred, and it slows down when the drives are idle, giving you a clear indication of the disk&rsquo;s activity.</p>

<p>SecureAccess Protects Your Data
Create a private folder or &ldquo;vault&rdquo; on your Cruzer USB Flash Drive with the SecureAccess software, available as a free download on sandisk.com. SecureAccess makes it easy to protect critical files like business presentations or legal documents. Simply drag and drop files into the vault, and they&rsquo;ll be protected by a personal password and automatic 128-bit AES encryption.3 You also get the added protection of secure online backup (up to 2 GB1) offered by SanDisk&rsquo;s online backup partner.4</p>

<p>The Cruzer USB Flash Drive is compatible as a flash storage device with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10+ and Linux machines.</p>

<h5 id="flashy">Flashy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No doubt, I lack the technical expertise to evaluate this flash drive – many reviewers provide excellent spec information on the quality parts and superior processing performance of the Cruzer. But I do have the hands-on expertise to say it is an awesome piece of equipment. File-sharing services may eventually make these drives obsolete, but for those who love securing their data on something they can see and hold, the SanDisk is outstanding. I use these little beauties to back up my computer. I can also easily download my huge graphic files to share with colleagues.The price has really come down, and for those who worry about the security of emailing files or cloud computing, flash drives offer a no-frills, secure, and easy solution to your storage and sharing needs. I also like the sliding USB connector. It stays tucked inside the case when not in use, but is easy to plug into any port. I love flash drives; there’s something very James Bond-ish about them. Like keeping a landline phone around to plug in when your Internet-enabled package gets knocked offline, keep a couple of these high-performance accessories around as a portable backup system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When purchasing flash drives I try to read the reviews and understand what I&rsquo;m getting into. Unfortunately, this one had no reviews, but was such a good deal, I decided to purchase it anyway. I have read about fake usb flash devices being sold (mainly on ebay but also on amazon), so I was a bit wary. Happily, this device is as advertised: I ran a full f3 test (this is the linux equivalent to h2testw) to determine the true capacity - it really is 64 GB and operates at USB 2.0 speeds (ubuntu disk utility benchmark reports average read rate of 35.8 MB/s and write rate of 3.0 MB/s).Pros:- good price (approx $1 per GB)- full 64 GB of storage in very small package- trusted SanDisk name- validates as true 64GB USB 2.0 device- small metal rod on back for connecting to key chain- BoBoTech shipped quicklyCons:- USB 2 is a bit slow (but USB3 devices are WAY more expensive)- plastic shell seems a bit flimsy (this hasn&rsquo;t been a problem on my smaller 16GB Cruzer)- <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; wider on each side from the connector - very tight fit next to power connector on my laptopOverall, I would recommend this drive if you are looking for a large capacity thumb drive and can live with USB 2 transfer speeds.</p>

<h5 id="sandisk-cruzer-64gb-vs-transcend-64-gb">SanDisk Cruzer 64GB VS Transcend 64 GB</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a SanDisk fan. I have always used there products and have been happy with the speed and reliability that they offered. Recently I upgraded from the SanDisk Cruzer 16GB to the 32GB. Right away I noticed it was taking longer to move files. Also from time to time it would just stop during transfer. I left it on all night thinking it would finish and it never did. I Decommissioned that one and bought another a few months later locally this time. I figured I must have gotten a hold of a bad one. The new 32GB Cruzer did the same thing. I just worked around the issues and continued using it. I figured the 32gb model must be flawed in some way. Still being a fan of SanDisk Cruzers I just recently upgraded to the 64GB model. So far it hasn&rsquo;t stopped during transfer but it still seemed to be taking to long. I decided to try a little test. I Purchased a Transcend 64GB thumb drive. I made a folder on my desktop and put 70 files of varying sizes equaling 4.03GB. I copied the folder to my SanDisk and timed it then I did the same with the Transcend. Here are the results:SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35 transferring 70 files equaling 4.03GB it took 18.34 minutesTranscend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive - TS64GJF500E transferring the same took 13.43 minutesI can&rsquo;t speak for the long term reliability of the Transcend thumb because this is the first I&rsquo;ve owned. What I do know is that it has a good solid feel, it&rsquo;s cheaper then the SanDisk of the same size, and it&rsquo;s considerably faster. I&rsquo;m going to continue testing this drive and if it works out and I grow to trust it I will post again and let everyone know. For now I&rsquo;m going to lean toward Transcend.** Update as of 01/30/2013 **I continued using both the Sandisk 64 and the Transcend 64 daily at work. The Sandisk is still significantly slower and occasionally stops responding during transfer. Unfortunately there is no safe way to remove it because technically it&rsquo;s still in use and will not respond to safe ejection procedures both in Windows and Linux. I just do a system shutdown hopping the OS will safely close the open files. I then remove it, restart the machine and try again. This may sound a bit extreme but I do it for a reason. One time it stopped responding on a 3 gig transfer so I let it sit for an hour. When I came back it was still unresponsive so I removed it and took it to another machine I was updating. When I inserted it the new machine I was asked if I wanted to format the Sandisk. I lost everything. Fortunately I had the same data on the transcend so it was just an inconvenience. If however I had been relying solely on the SanDisk it would have been a very long night. The Transcend 64 still continues to surprise me with it&rsquo;s reliability and speed. It is used at work in the daily grind and shows no signs of instability or speed loss.Seven month tested daily, head to head- Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive TS64GJF500E VS SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35. And!&hellip; It&rsquo;s Transcend for the Win! Sorry SanDisk, this was a complete miss match. With all your resources, funding, and experience You should have stomped transcend into the ground. You need to get your staff into one room and discuss who dropped the ball and what your going to do about it. Your pro&rsquo;s, this should never have happened and because it did you&rsquo;ve introduced doubt into the minds of consumers you had won over years ago. This leaves me wondering was it a shameful loss for SanDisk or is there a new player in the game. In my opinion Transcend just stepped out of the background and into the foreground. They will be given serious consideration during my purchases in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more I find the problem is not that memory sticks fill up, but that I can&rsquo;t find one when I need one. So this set of two thumb drives was perfect for my needs.SanDisk stuff has proven reliable, I especially like that the plug is retractable to keep it away from dust and dirt. Thumb drives tend to sit in my bag for months till I need them so that&rsquo;s a great feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This flash drive is exceptionally good for those who want large amounts of data to work with, and are on a budget. If you are carrying files around for work or personal, you should have more than enough room on this to carry it all&hellip;even if you are transporting large GB level files. It&rsquo;s only downside is that you don&rsquo;t seem to get the whole 64 GB for the sandisk installer on there&hellip;but it&rsquo;s still more than enough to work with.</p>
