<h5 id="crashes-my-phone">CRASHES my Phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried to use this only as a location to store my music on my phone (Sony Xperia Z3) as I have a lot of music, and after a month if using this, it stopped working. Let me explain, I put most of my music on this, then go listen to my music. After a few songs EVERY music app I&rsquo;ve tried attempts to read the card but fails, the songs skips a bit, then crashes my phone forcing an automatic Restart. Once restarted and I attempt to access anything on the SD card my phone crashes again, and again and again. I can delete all the files and reformat the SD card but the same thing always eventually happens. If there is a fix for this let me know eh, but for now, I can&rsquo;t return it and wasted $80.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="complete-and-disastrous-failure">Complete and disastrous failure.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got one of these for my Note 4 and it worked great. At least until it completely failed and I lost everything I had that was stored on it. Pictures, data, etc.(about 5 months worth). Gone. No longer existing. It was covered under warranty. Yeehaw! A new BLANK is coming! I expect it will be here any day now. So now, how do I go about trusting the replacement with my important data?: Don&rsquo;t see how I can at this point. The $90 I paid for it is nothing to what I lost. Perhaps I will give it to the cat to bat around the kitchen floor. I see that Amazon has a sale going on today with Transcend memory. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll try that brand instead. Blah, blah blah!</p>

<h5 id="failed-after-8-months-of-use">Failed after 8 months of use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this in November 2014 and is unusable now. My phone was able Mount and store data in it. I was able to use it through June 2015 this past week it is unmountable by my android phone and inaccessible. I tried reformatting it multiple times but nothing is fixed it. I lost a ton of data and I never even filled up to max capacity.</p>

<h5 id="sd-card-failed-at-the-worse-time">SD CARD FAILED AT THE WORSE TIME!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How is this for the ultimate slap-in-the-face? I was with my daughter at the Taylor Swift 1989 tour concert in San Diego last night using my Galaxy Note 4 to take pictures and videos of the entire ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME experience and I even have my phone set to automatically back-up to my Dropbox account just in case something happens. Despite all my precautions when I looked at my phone this morning there was this message about not supporting the SD card&rsquo;s file system with the prompt to format the card. While I did not do anything to the card I did power down the phone, remove the card and placed it in the SD micro-adapter and tried to look at it in my computer and then again with a different USB reader and while I can read all other SD and MicroSD cards I can not see/read this card that HAD ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME NOT REPLACEABLE PICTURES!!!!! Apparently at some point in the evening (probably when the SD card FAILED) the phone started saving pictures directly to the phones memory, but unfortunately the pictures are from the last performance of the evening. I do like San Disk and I do think they make a nice product, but this could not have failed at a WORSE TIME!!!!!!</p>

<h5 id="get-real-sandisk-microsd-cards-from-amazon">Get REAL SanDisk MicroSD Cards from Amazon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does what it is supposed to do! I had ordered three identical microSD cards from another site. All three were &ldquo;defective&rdquo;. They were supposed to hold 128 Gb, but when I got about 6 Gb on each card, I began to get errors and scanning with the Windows utility didn&rsquo;t fix the problem. I spent literally hours loading music on these other discs, only to have them fail at some point. According to several posts on the internet, these are either rejects from SanDisk or outright fakes which have software on them which fools your computer when you first insert them into your reader. It tells the computer they hold 128 Gb, but really they hold much less and even that smaller amount won&rsquo;t work reliably. I decided to order from Amazon as a last resort, since Amazon was more expensive, but the one I got from Amazon works exactly as it is supposed to. I knew that Amazon would not offer &ldquo;fakes&rdquo; or defective cards as they are too big in the marketplace to tolerate a lot of unhappy customers due to bad merchandise.</p>

<h5 id="fails-after-3-months-good-luck-getting-amazon-to-stand-behind-it">FAILS AFTER 3 MONTHS, Good luck getting amazon to stand behind it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>bought this on December 3rd, and now it has stopped working in any sense of the word&hellip; phone no longer will access anything on card, took out of phone and tried to access using computer, No luck&hellip; seems to me something from SanDISK SOLD BY AMAZON that fails in 3 months should be backed by amazon PERIOD! If you want more storage, and want it to last just long enough to move ALL of your documents, photos, scanned reciepts etc.. just so you can loose EVERYTHING.. then by all means buy this. Because Amazon won&rsquo;t even allow you to file a claim on a faulty product&hellip; SOL</p>

<h5 id="wish-they-were-faster-very-reliable">Wish they were faster. Very reliable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that so much data can fit in such a tiny form factor, but &hellip; I wish it was faster. I use two 128GB SanDisk Ultra cards, each just over half full (and filling more over time), in a Fiio X5 music player. It might be the OS or it might be the SanDisk cards, or both, but it takes much longer to organize itself than it would on an iMac or a MacBook with a flash drive. If I continue playing where I left off when I last shut it down, or if it continues the shuffle it&rsquo;s already determined, it&rsquo;s fine. No slowness. But if I leave the shuffle and go to &ldquo;All Songs&rdquo; or &ldquo;Genres&rdquo; or &ldquo;Artists&rdquo;, the new sort takes a painfully long time. On a plane, I&rsquo;ve got plenty of time and I might just nod off while I&rsquo;m waiting. Anywhere else on the go, it&rsquo;s a pain. I know we have ridiculously high expectations. (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re listening to perfect recordings, from a box, in your hand, with earphones better than the best h-fi speakers available when the iPod came out.&rdquo; I know.) But the iPhones, iPads, iMacs and Macbooks and high-end PCs have set a high bar. It takes a long time to copy files to these the SD cards, whether the card is in the player and connected by USB cord, or the card is plugged into the card slot in the back of the imac. Lots longer than it takes to copy to USB hard drives or thunderbolt or firewire hard drives. Same when the X5 is connected to a Windows 7 laptop and you wait for the files on the SD cards to show up in &ldquo;My Computer.&rdquo; The cards are formatted with FAT and I have run chkdsk /f from the Widnows laptop. The file structures are fine. The speed is about the same on both cards. They never crash.</p>
