<h5 id="worked-great-before-it-died-but-it-s-got-a-10-year-warranty">Worked great before it died, but it&rsquo;s got a 10 year* warranty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first Samsung flash drive purchase. I wanted a USB 3.0 device and I liked the overall aesthetic of this drive, with the aluminum body and cap which was easily held on with a lanyard string to prevent it from getting lost. The drive itself is very compact and easy to lose if you don&rsquo;t keep it somewhere conspicuous. I just kept it on my key-chain and that worked for me. It also came in handy when I needed quick access to the USB drive. I was able to store and transfer so many files with the 128GB capacity. The USB 3.0 speed was a welcome addition. I purchased this in March and it just died at the end of June, so I got 4 months of usage before it died. Luckily, this drive is backed by a 10 year warranty from Amazon. I was not aware of this until I contacted Samsung for warranty service. They wrote the following email to me:&ldquo;Please contact Amazon for Warranty service as they are under contract to fulfill the warranty for units purchased from their site. The contract they are under requires them to replace it under warranty for its entire 10 year Warranty period.You might have to ask for someone higher up as some lower level agents are not aware of the contract for some reason and go based off their 30 day return policy.&ldquo;I then contacted Amazon via their online customer chat and asked for a replacement. I was told the drive was out of my 30 day return period and that I would have to contact Samsung. Guess what? I copied and pasted the above response from Samsung in quotes and was given a return label and sent a replacement drive by the same online customer service representative! So, if you encounter the same problem, feel free to copy and paste the response I got. Now I anxiously await my replacement.Update 11/4/16I received my replacement a couple days later and it works just as great as the first drive I received. Fingers crossed that this one will last much longer. I didn&rsquo;t keep anything on the drive that was mission critical but if you are keeping important files on your flash drive, it&rsquo;s a good idea to make a backup copy on your computer or another drive just in case your Samsung USB drive dies on you.Update 10/25/17*It&rsquo;s been nearly a year since I&rsquo;ve had this drive now and no issues whatsoever since I&rsquo;ve gotten my replacement. I also noticed that they downgraded the warranty from 10 years to 5 years, but I&rsquo;m leaving the 10 year warranty title alone for those who purchased this drive when the 10 year warranty was around.[&hellip;] Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="great-otg-usb-flash-drive">Great OTG USB flash drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So this works great. Just as expected. I have used this for transferring large amount of files from my phone to my PC. This will only work on devices that support On The Go (OTG). Almost all Android devices support this. Including flagship Galaxy devices. You will need a file explorer app installed on your mobile device in order to manage files on this flash drive if your mobile device doesn&rsquo;t have one installed. On Galaxy devices it is the my files app. Highly recommend this drive to anyone that wants extra storage for their phones. I usually carry multiples of these OTG drives with movies and music so that I never run out of storage on my phone. Read and write speeds are not as fast on mobile devices as they are on regular computers. But if you are looking for portable storage for your phone or tablet then highly recommend you giving this a try.</p>

<h5 id="a-fast-drive-first-i-ve-seen-approach-the-claimed-speed-dual-interface-design-brilliant-solidly-made">A Fast Drive &amp; First I&rsquo;ve Seen Approach The Claimed Speed, Dual Interface Design Brilliant, Solidly Made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Samsung knows flash! This tiny versatile and solidly made drive is impressively faster than others I&rsquo;ve tried. This is both subjectively observed and confirmed with Crystal Disk Mark. The Duo flash drive comes close to the claimed 130MB/s transfer rate when reading sequentially. Sequential writing speeds of 30 to 45MB/s are also stand-out results.Slower random read/write speeds (lots of small files) are expected, but the slowdown Crystal DiskMark reports for small files is greater than other USB 3.0 flash drives I&rsquo;ve tried. The random read/write speeds reported are 5.5MB/s and 1.8MB/s. Subjectively (copying a folder of about a gigabyte of small files) it didn&rsquo;t seem so slow. This could be a benchmark anomaly.But there is a lot more than speed with the little beauty. Here is what I like:+ the metal case is sturdy and very nice looking.+ the drive is smaller than other flash drives I own+ the lanyard hole (not included) goes through the end-cap helping to keep it from being lost!+ the end-cap fits snugly (less easy to pop off in the pocket)+ dual USB plug (A and Micro-USB) are very handy+ it&rsquo;s very nice not to need an adapter cable with my tablets!+ no preloaded junk-ware, just a clean formatted empty driveDownsides (neither being a big deal for me)- maybe the random read/write speeds could be faster- gets pretty warm with large copies or running Crystal DiskMarkA note about speed and benchmarks: The drive is compatible with USB 2 but will only run at USB 2 speeds in a USB 2 plug. I have found that using the newest USB 3.0 drivers can make a HUGE difference in performance. I have done my testing with the very newest drivers I could find at the time of this review. Also if you have 3+ year old USB 3 device your performance could be limited by old hardware. I bring this up because your results may vary and by a lot at no fault of the flash drive.Conclusions:I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of USB drives over the years; Both USB 2 and 3. This is the first that actually comes close to its claimed speed. For me that alone makes this special. The dual interface flash drive is a great performer that works with my tablets and computers equally well. The thoughtful design is really nice and it is pretty as well as functional.I have Samsung SSD EVO drives and SD media I&rsquo;ve been using and pleased with. I expected this Duo drive to be excellent, but it blew right through my expectations. Well done Samsung. I&rsquo;m giving the Duo a solid 5 stars.</p>
