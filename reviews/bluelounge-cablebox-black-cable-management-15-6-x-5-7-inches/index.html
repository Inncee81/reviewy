<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="makes-a-big-difference">makes a BIG difference</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Would get 5 stars if it was a bit less expensive, but still worth it. I had earlier purchased the smaller one, and have been very happy with it. This bigger one cleaned up a big mess of cords on my living room entertainment center. For before and after pictures,see pic I uploaded to this page.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-but">Excellent product, but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great product for hiding tons of cables and adapters. HERES WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW:When you open the CableBox, there is a flyer for social media on the inside bottom. As you remove it, be VERY CAREFUL to pull up as much (if not all) of the adhesive holding the flyer, WITH the flyer. If you do not do this, it will leave a ton of glue-like substance on the bottom and you will NOT BE ABLE TO REMOVE IT. I spent 2-3 hours scrubbing at it with All-Purpose cleaner and 99% rubbing alcohol, scratching it up with my fingernails, NOTHING WORKS. You need to get as much of it off as possible when you initially take off the flyer or it will be forever a sticky mess at the bottom of your cablebox. For some reason, the adhesive used in the white cable box is much much easier to pull off. It&rsquo;s only this one that is a problem. BlueLounge if you&rsquo;re reading this: please use a less permanent adhesive. This is ridiculous</p>

<h5 id="get-rid-of-that-spaghetti-bowl">Get rid of that spaghetti bowl!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What took me so long to clean up my hodgepodge of wires, cables, and cords? Aesthetics and safety are important to me, especially in my study, which is also the library, piano room, and yoga room. I desire a calm ambiance, surrounded by my 2000 books. However, until I bought this BlueLounge box, the floor between my desk and pedestal looked like the center of the &ldquo;Dallas mixmaster&rdquo; of interstates, with prominent dust bunnies collecting on this untidy collection of cables. Now, it is clean, orderly, and unobtrusive.The box is plain, rectangular, and deep, with a matte finish (I have the black one), made from fire-retardant plastic. If you are using a precarious device to store your cables, like a shoebox, it is a dangerous fire hazard; it is well worth the money to protect your home from turning into a fireball.Dimensions are 398 mm/15.6 in long, 154 mm/6 in wide, and 134 mm/5.3 inches deep, with rubber feet to prevent it from slipping. There&rsquo;s plenty of storage space&ndash;looks about the size of a shoebox.I placed a large 12-outlet surge protector in the BlueLounge box without needing to unplug anything. I could have easily fit a second one in there, also. The outlets or openings on each end of the box are about 3.5 inches long and ¾ inch wide, plenty of room for the mass of cables. I tucked the box on the bottom shelf of my pedestal, and voila! From helter-skelter to harmony, all in a few minutes. It&rsquo;s like a 3-minute manager for just 25 bucks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bigger-than-i-expected-perfect-for-what-i-needed">Bigger than I expected. Perfect for what I needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The box is bigger than what I expected. I&rsquo;ve got a rather large surge protector / power strip for my PC and associated &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;&hellip; full-sized PC, dual monitors, 2 laptops, printer, scanner and speakers. All of the plugs, power bricks and excess cord fit nicely into the box.It took a while, but I was able to route all of the wiring down a piece of self-adhesive J-channel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ILS0WW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ILS0WW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) attached to the back of my desk to where it runs into my PC. I also used a few feet of MonsterCable wrap (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WNIZOI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WNIZOI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) that really finished things off nicely. This box, combined with the 2 items above, made it so my desk (with a side profile visible down a hallway, so the wiring is very noticeable) looks clean and clutter free.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-way-to-hide-unsightly-cords-and-cables">Great way to hide unsightly cords and cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great way to organize and declutter your cables, wires, and power cords. I got this for the living room entertainment system. I have my TV, receiver, blu-ray player, streaming device, universal home control hub plugged into a power strip. Adding to the mess of wires was an ethernet router and the accompanying ethernet wires plugged into the devices. That mess of cables and wires was placed in an open top basket in my attempt to confine the mess. It looked like some kind of twisted bird&rsquo;s nest.The cable box cleaned all that up. I was able to fit my power strip, ethernet router, and all the jumble of cables inside of the box. The lid closes the box and hides the mess inside. All you see is the power strip cord extending out from the back into the wall, the ether net cable, and the remaining cables that go to the devices. The box comes with some cable ties to further organize the mess. Makes the whole affair much more attractive the basket of tangles I had before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-unconventional-use-but-it-worked-great-for-my-needs">An unconventional use but it worked great for my needs.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this thing. I mounted mine to the wall though because my entertainment center is all wall mounted and didn&rsquo;t want cables danging all over the floor to the outlet.If you want to wall mount it take into consideration you should pre drill holes smaller than your screws so it doesn&rsquo;t crack the plastic. Use a washer as well so the pressure around the head of the screw is distributed a little better. I put a piece of laminate flooring to the inside back as well to reinforce it and make absolutely sure an impact to the box wouldn&rsquo;t cause it to bust off the screws. The added bonus to this is you can put screws i the laminate piece to mount the power strip if your&rsquo;s can do that.Everything fit nicely into it so I&rsquo;d happily recommend this product. All I need to do now is order the cable concealer to run from the box to the outlet for the power strip cable and I&rsquo;m done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-cable-box-you-can-buy">The best cable box you can buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I keep buying these because they&rsquo;re the best cable boxes you can buy. I have 7 of them and just bought an 8th. I probably need one more too if I&rsquo;m being honest with myself.If I were BlueLounge and wanted to release an updated version, there&rsquo;s only a couple of things I&rsquo;d change:* Add rubberized bottom to keep it from moving at all. It doesn&rsquo;t move much, but it&rsquo;d be nice.* Make the larger ones an inch or two wider to accommodate larger surge protectors. This is a <em>huge</em> pain point for me and probably for most of the people buying this.If you need a cable box, don&rsquo;t buy the cheap ones—I did this once just to see and they&rsquo;re nowhere near as quality as this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much nicer than cords all over the floor! Looks sharp and organized.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy-pick-this-one">Good buy, pick this one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does exactly what it is supposed to, the lid goes down firmly enough to press bulging masses of cables down without lifting and the rubber things on the bottom are sticky enough&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Has really helped me clean up my cable management.</p>

<p>Hides your cables, chargers and power bricks. It is a bit on the big side, but leaves plenty of room for your stuff.</p>

<h5 id="good-but-pricey">Good but pricey</h5>

<p>Nicely designed and met my expectations. A bit pricey!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a bunch in the past - perfect. Now, I bought two more &ndash; and they were fake chinese imitations.</p>
