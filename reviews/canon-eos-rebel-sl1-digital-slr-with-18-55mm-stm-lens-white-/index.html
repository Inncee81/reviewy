<h5 id="professional-looking-photos-without-a-professional-photographer">Professional looking photos without a professional photographer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first professional camera I have ever had and I highly recommend it. I take pictures of everything with the camera (food for blogging, my kids, flowers, etc) and it has really impressed me! I bought it right before we went on a trip and it was perfect. I am excited to take our own Christmas photos with this. I find myself constantly amazed when viewing the pictures after I take them because they are such amazing quality! It really feels like there was a professional photographer with us when I use the camera. I LOVE IT! The white was also a great color to get. I am usually always choosing black but there was something really sharp looking about the white and I am so glad I got it. LOVE THIS CAMERA!</p>

<h5 id="a-very-capable-starter-dslr">A Very Capable Starter DSLR</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should open this review by saying I don&rsquo;t even consider myself an &lsquo;amateur photographer&rsquo;, as that now seems to be read as implying some kind of expertise. I do enjoy taking photos, and since I print a good amount of them I like them to be as high quality as I can make them without breaking the bank. I had a lower end, compact point and shoot along with a better point and shoot for special events or trips. Over time, it became pretty clear that my cell phone would easily match the cheaper point and shoot and so I decided to get an actual DSLR as my sole non-cell camera. I&rsquo;ve used Canon for most of my life, and I wanted to stick with that so I started looking into cameras that were good but under $1000. After a few weeks of reading the pros and cons of a variety of models, I went with the SL1. I had seen some very nice images from it, the size was right, and Amazon had a good deal on a bundle with it.So far, it&rsquo;s been a great experience with this camera. It pretty much nailed the sweet spot I was looking for as far as giving me really good image quality in a fairly compact DSLR. I found the response time on taking images to very speedy, the clarity in both day and night shots is very good, and overall I feel like there&rsquo;s really not much I can&rsquo;t handle with the unit. For my first DSLR, I think I made the right decision is picking this one up. I also tested it using one of the EyeFi memory cards, and it works well with it although the delay in between taking shots is much more noticeable. Even so, it&rsquo;s great to have the option for times where I want to quickly transfer photos to my phone and post them.</p>

<h5 id="best-little-camera-ever">Best little camera ever&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great camera. Cannon finally got a lot of things right. The touch screen is a pleasure to use. The camera is a perfect size to not be too heavy or too light. The thing takes great pictures. I guess the only thing I would do knowing what I know now is just buy the camera body and get something like an 18mm to 135mm lens separately rather than the bundle I choose. To top it all off it takes great pictures in my opinion. To me this is a knockout.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="light-small-and-ever-so-powerful">Light.. &amp; Small.. And ever so Powerful..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was to be my first DSLR camera so I had to get something that made a mark. Well folks this camera was the one to pack that punch. It&rsquo;s white exterior leaves it sexy and unique, while the internals have you covered with processing power that delivers amazing photos. Your images will look great and your videos look professional. I&rsquo;m really glad to have purchased this camera and can&rsquo;t wait to learn more about photography and capture great shots time and time again.If your new to the market consider this DSLR camera from Canon. CHECK IT OUT!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-solid-purchase">Good, solid purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome travel camera. For most people it can even serve as their go to everyday camera. For travel, if you pop in a 40mm pancake lens, it&rsquo;s extremely compact and good for shooting street photography. The lens wont get in your way and you actually think about composing shots due to lack of zoom if using a prime lens. Picture quality is decent and pretty much on par with slightly more upscale camera (t5i etc). The battery life is ok, but not great. I averaged around 3 to 400 shots before I needed to change battery. I def recommending getting an extra battery along with your purchase. Overall, a solid purchase if you want to use a travel camera (due to it&rsquo;s weight and size) or if you want a starting dslr (pretty good value). However, keep in mind that lack of a swivel screen can affect you if you take a lot of abnormal angle shots.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-tiny-dslr">Great little (tiny) DSLR</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Normally shoot with a Canon 5d Mark III, but wanted a little point-and-shoot to carry in my bag for little hikes and trips. This DSLR is small and light enough to carry every day (with a prime 50mm lens it&rsquo;s very light, even lighter with the little pancake lens), and still gives the power and flexibility of a DSLR. I love it!It&rsquo;s a bit of an adjustment from full-frame, and a smaller body, but that hasn&rsquo;t been too hard. And it&rsquo;s great that all my EF lenses work on this camera too.</p>

<h5 id="this-camera-was-perfect-i-am-4-11-so-i-m-short-and-i">This camera was perfect. I am 4&rsquo;11&rdquo; so I&rsquo;m short and I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only owned one other DSLR and it was the Canon Rebel T1i. I was wanting to upgrade from that but also looking for something a little smaller. This camera was perfect. I am 4&rsquo;11&rdquo; so I&rsquo;m short and I have little hands. The SL1 definitely fits better in my hands and is easier to manage with just one hand. I was able to keep my larger lenses from my T1i since they were EF-S lenses which is what is needed for the SL1 (Better quality). I love the picture quality that I am getting. Of course it is only a slight improvement but enough for me to notice.It&rsquo;s easy to use, I love the white, and it&rsquo;s small enough to fit into smaller hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-camera">I love this camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this camera. Took hundreds of pictures in Yellowstone, everyone of them fantastic. This camera replaces my canon t2i that was stolen, I was heartbroken by the loss, but I have to say it is better. Lighter, the hd quality far exceeds my previous camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Inexpensive. Fits well for my task. the picture quality is suitableI recommend</p>

<h5 id="that-s-what-i-love-about-it">That&rsquo;s what I love about it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very small. That&rsquo;s what I love about it. I would have given five stars if the screen was one of those ones that flip around. Great camera for the price though.</p>
