<h5 id="six-year-old-loves-it">Six year old loves it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We live at a lake, so I purchased this for my son&rsquo;s 6th birthday. He was so excited to have &ldquo;a kayak of his own&rdquo; that he slept it in for a week in his bedroom. (The instructions do say not to sit in it when it&rsquo;s not in the water because it can deform it, but we figured it&rsquo;d be fine). He&rsquo;s taken it out twice so far. The first time we attached a long rope to the handle so that he couldn&rsquo;t potentially float away (it was a very windy day). The second time he asked to have the rope off and even practiced paddling on his knees, standing up on it (like a paddle board), tipping over, swimming around and climbing up the back. His grandmother was amazed how quickly he was able to steer with his paddle. He&rsquo;s proud of it and loves to pull it out of the water. He can&rsquo;t carry it yet: 18 pounds is too heavy and it&rsquo;s too bulky. He loves the independence of it, considering many other water toys (paddle boards, paddle boats, row boats, etc.) are too big for him. We purchased a paddle leash because, while there are notches in the kayak to sit the paddle, he knocked it into the water a few times while playing about. One piece of advice about pricing: check frequently. We got the green one for under a hundred dollars. The price on the green and blues ones fluctuate every couple of weeks or so.</p>

<h5 id="my-son-loved-it-small-enough-to-fit-in-the-back">My son loved it! Small enough to fit in the back &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this for our 9 year old who is getting into fishing. It arrived quicker than stated. Although it did arrive in a plastic bag which was ripped and had some scratches on the hull but we really didn&rsquo;t mind due to using it right after. My son loved it! Small enough to fit in the back of the truck. Light enough for my son to carry. Its extremely stable so he is able to stand on it while fishing. I have a kayak so mine is a little faster but I would rather have a stable platform for my son. Great product may buy another for the older son!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="after-2-summers-we-re-still-happy-with-it">After 2 summers, we&rsquo;re still happy with it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For what we are using the kayak for, it&rsquo;s perfect. We have not come up against any problems whatsoever in the 2 summers my daughter has used it. My daughter was 8 years old when we first got it, and she found the kayak very easy to use.Before we purchased, I contacted the company to try to figure out how long she would be able to use the kayak (I didn&rsquo;t want to get it and find out that she would be too big when she turned 10, for example). They explained that there is no real height limit, only a weight limit (130 lbs). Obviously this kayak is shorter than an adult&rsquo;s kayak, but it&rsquo;s true, an adult woman under the weight limit could use it though her knees would be somewhat bent. Anyway, the point is that if you are buying this for an 8 year old, it should be usable for years.I admit we haven&rsquo;t exactly strained the limits of this kayak, but for our use (8/9/10 year old on lakes) we&rsquo;ve been nothing but pleased. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s lacking some features people want but for us, it&rsquo;s done the job and we&rsquo;ve been happy.</p>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-our-purchase">Very happy with our purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My eight-year old daughter loves it. A little difficult for her to carry it, though it is light weight. Very happy with our purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-starter-kayak">Great starter Kayak</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a perfect starter Kayak for a kid. We bought this for our 8 year old as her birthday present. She loves it! It is easy to paddle, she does not get frustrated because it glides right to where she wants it to go. It is easy for her to get in and out of. She has not tipped it yet or jumped in from it to use the swim up on the back, but I like that she has that option so she can get back on without an adult having to jump in and try and push her back on. The boat is lightweight making it easy for a kid to drag it onto shore or for it to be thrown onto a storage shelf when not in use. It even comes with a paddle, which makes it super simple to just get it and go!Pros:LightweightDoes not tip easilyEasy to paddleComes with paddleCons:No dry compartmentShe wants it to have a cup holder</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-buy-for-your-child">Excellent buy for your child!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent buy! Very stable and easily maneuvered! We bought this for our daughters 8th birthday. She is very tall (about as tall as your average 10-11 yr old) for her age and about 97 lbs. We let her try this out in the pool to see how she handled it before turning her loose in the river. She has ridden in canoes and kayaks but never been in one alone. She was instantly able to maneuver this kayak wherever she wanted. We took her to the river and she did great. She was able to glide right through the rapids and never tipped over. She was also able to stop and hold this kayak in the rapids also which is a huge plus! She was also able to get off and on it with ease in the deeper areas of the river. It is light enough that we did not have to help her at all throughout the day, while stopping to play in the water or on the sand bars (we did take it to the water&rsquo;s edge when starting our adventure and put it in the truck at the end) . This is the perfect kayak for a child! We did buy a seat and a net to put on this, though I am not sure they are the correct size, as we were not able to put them on before we went kayaking, but she never complained of being uncomfortable and we just carried her drink and snacks with us. We were on the water for about 6 hours including stops along the way.</p>

<h5 id="buy-it">Buy it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My grandson loves this. He is almost 5, but tall like a 6-year-old. He wears a life jacket and quickly learned how to maneuver around a small pond. We also had two 7-year-old girls use it at once. Very stable! It does not capsize unless his dad tries to use it. Haha. Sturdy too. It fell out of the truck onto the pavement but received not a scratch or dent. Buy some life jackets and you then have a very safe kayak experience for kids. It is well designed for safety and yet also glides nicely through the water in a pond or lake.</p>

<h5 id="love">love</h5>

<blockquote>

<h5 id="great-kayaks-for-children">Great kayaks for children</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son loves his kayak. He&rsquo;s been learning to use it in our pool, but can&rsquo;t wait to go out into the lakes and creeks. It&rsquo;s a great little kayak for the youngsters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-4-now-5-year-old-loves-it-he-s">my 4 (now 5) year old loves it. He&rsquo;s &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my 4 (now 5) year old loves it. He&rsquo;s small, but can paddle it wherever he wants to go. It&rsquo;s very stable and he can lay down when he&rsquo;s tired, we tie it to mine for towing when&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kids-love-them">Kids love them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kids love them. 120 pound rating is pretty accurate. 130 lbs will push the boat into the water enough to submerge the kayak a little</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-it-s-so-cool-and-so-great">Excellent quality, It&rsquo;s so cool and so great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality, It&rsquo;s so cool and so great! Nice for the price. You can buy one for yourself or somebody else maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-boat-for-price">Great Boat for Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old. Both loved it and we are purchasing another. Use it on a lake, but not a river yet. Great boat for the price.</p>
