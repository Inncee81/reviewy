<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fair-quality-case-and-battery-charger">Fair quality case and battery/charger.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case and battery travel charger are made by Vivitar and are fairly good quality. I have not used the battery yet, but will update my review if I have and issues with it. The USB SD card adapter pictured here is slightly different than the one sent, but no complaints, because rather than just being an SD card adapter, it was also a Micro SD card adapter (not high quality, but you get what you pay for and it seems to work ok.). The tripod is very small, and kind of cheap looking. I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, though. The screen protectors are quite thin and I had some trouble applying them the screen - if you leave ANY bubbles behind your screen looks dirty. Better than nothing, but not great quality. HOWEVER, I bought the kit mainly for the case and battery/charger, not for the other stuff, and for the price I am satisfied!</p>

<h5 id="accessorize-your-nikon">Accessorize your Nikon</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A new camera is a thrill and a challenge for the same reason: here&rsquo;s new technology to learn! But if you want to get more use out of your camera, you need some goodies that the manufacturer provides only at a significant additional cost.The cute little tripod is great for taking selfies that don&rsquo;t include an arm extending out of the picture (holding the camera). It was a little tricky to figure out how the camera would balance on this tripod because the screw port on the camera is off at one end, but the tripod works fine with a bit of practice.The case is all you could want for convenience and protection. In the convenience category, it can hang on a shoulder or on your belt, or if you are wearing cargo pants, it slips easily into one of the big pockets. The double zipper pulls mean you can let the wrist-strap from the camera hang out, giving you a grip and point of reference before you pull it out. That means both quicker and safer access to your new toy.In the nice-to-have category, I list both the 12-volt charger and the USB reader adapter. I haven&rsquo;t needed the former, though it&rsquo;s comforting that I could charge the camera battery in my car. Since both my computer and TV can read SD cards, I haven&rsquo;t actually plugged in the adapter, but if your other hardware lacks this feature, this is a great addition.I really appreciate the screen protector film because I cracked the screen on an older camera and that might not have happened if it had been covered by just that little bit of cushioning.My favorite part of the kit is the battery and charger. I was concerned about the battery because you never know if it&rsquo;s going to work as well as the original. I have found that this battery lasts just as long as the one that came with the camera, holding a charge through lots of pictures, whether you use flash or ambient light. Having a second battery is absolutely essential, especially since when you want to take pictures, you can&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Wait a couple hours until I recharge!&rdquo; The spare fits in the camera case nicely and comes with a protector that covers the contacts, so it&rsquo;s handy when you need to change but safely stored at the same time. The charger is so neat it&rsquo;s nearly perfect! Just slip the battery in the niche -it only fits one way- then turn the contacts out of their storage position (Yes, the prongs fold out of the way for convenient carrying!) and plug it into the wall. No cords to worry about, no wrapping and unwrapping, just plug it in and forget it for a while because it won&rsquo;t overcharge! Wish my electric drills had such a feature!In summary, this kit has more than you need to get your new camera functional. Butterfly even includes a micro-cloth to clean your lens, so you are good to go! It&rsquo;s worth every penny!</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-your-nikon-coolpix">A &ldquo;Must-Have&rdquo; for your Nikon Coolpix</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a great deal for my new Nikon S9900 camera. The camera fits perfectly in the durable, hard shell case. There is a separate pocket in the case for an extra battery, SD card, and the connection cord. However, I noticed that the items could easily fall out of the pocket when I removed the camera; I put the battery &amp; SD card in a small mesh bag that should keep it secure. The charger works well, and the small tripod will come in handy. The protective film for the viewing window was a bit tricky to put on, but the kit comes with 3 sheets of the film (I got it right the 3rd try). The only other item I wish the kit included was a neck strap for the camera. I am really glad I bought the kit - it is a &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; for the Nikon Coolpix S9900.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-great-deal">Super Great Deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great kit wonderful. Everything was wonderful, everything fit, everything was amazing if you have a Nikon Coolpix camera this is definitely the case for this camera if didn&rsquo;t get one with the camera originally plus all the other cool add-ons is just amazing</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-accessory-kit">Very nice accessory kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice accessory kit. The Nikon COOLPIX A900 camera fits a little loosely in the case, but it&rsquo;s nothing to worry about. The only reason this is a four star review is that the screen protectors are very thin, difficult to apply on the screen, and do not stick long. Otherwise, everything else is nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="protects-camera-well">Protects Camera Well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These products are awesome. Hardshell case is great and protects the camera well. I am not claiming that this case is waterproof by any means, but just yesterday it protected our camera from water damage. Just yesterday, an entire bottle of water spilled in my wife&rsquo;s purse (without our knowledge) and pooled in the bottom while on an airplane. 3 hours later when we were about to land, we noticed the pool in the purse and worried about the camera. The case was definitely wet, but no water was inside the case. I would definitely suggest this product as it saved our camera and we are very happy / lucky to have purchased this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-for-everything-you-get">Great price for everything you get</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great price for everything you get. Love the hard case so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about protecting the camera. Extra card, battery charger, and mini-tripod all fit in the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-just-a-little-more-money-you-get-a-lot-for-your-nikon-coolpix-a900-camera">For just a little more money you get a LOT for your Nikon Coolpix A900 camera!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you purchase the Nikon Coolpix A900 camera, it is a very good idea to also buy the accessories kit&ndash;especially for the case and extra battery, but I personally feel that it is a good idea to also purchase a stand alone battery charger so as not to have to charge the battery through the camera in case that you want to charge it while still using your A900 after inserting an extra battery in it..</p>
