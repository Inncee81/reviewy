<h5 id="excellent-midi-device-for-ios">Excellent Midi Device for iOS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best midi devices I have used with my iOS devices. I am primarily using it to control various synths and samplers on my iPhone 6 Plus. The Jamstik is a great solution for guitar players that aren&rsquo;t comfortable using traditional piano-style midi controllers (like myself).You don&rsquo;t have to COMPLETELY change your playing style but there are some changes most guitarists will need to get used to. First, the bends don&rsquo;t feel or sound natural. Second, you can&rsquo;t slide from fret to fret like you would with a normal guitar. It may not be as expressive as a real guitar but the size and versatility makes up for that in my book.I considered a midi pick up (Fishman Triple Play) but didn&rsquo;t want the hassle of installation. In addition, I wanted something small and lightweight that I could comfortably play on the couch, in a jam session with friends, etc. I also considered the YRG but went with the Jamstik because it&rsquo;s wireless, smaller and is really made for iOS.Latency is NOT an issue on my iPhone 6 Plus. For example, I can run Audiobus with two different synths (Sampletank and Animoog) in separate input slots and the Jamstik will control both simultaneously no problem. Then I can layer effects in the effect slots for each (JamUp Pro, AUFX:Dub, Echopad, etc). Even with all of these apps running, latency is not an issue.On my iPad Air (1st Gen) it&rsquo;s a different story&hellip;.. Latency is noticeable and notes will often not trigger. I tried running several apps at once (same Audiobus setup I listed above for iPhone 6 Plus) and it was impossible to work with. I even ran one synth app at a time and latency was still slightly noticeable. To be clear, this is the fault of the iPad, not the Jamstik.If you want a fun midi controller that feels and plays similar to a guitar, get a Jamstik. If you expect the Jamstik to be a guitar replacement, you will be disappointed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jamstik is just about the coolest thing ever. I have been playing different sounds, capturing and playing samples, and just having a blast ever since I got it! As a guitar player for 40+ years, the Jamstik has opened up new horizons of playing fun for me!I also travel a lot, so with the Jamstik, my iPhone, and a mini speaker in my backpack, I can play anywhere.I liked it so much, that I upgraded to the Jamstik+ soon after buying.And their website is full of great videos and advice, too. The folks at Jamstik were great at helping me to get the unit set up to my playing preference, and getting the most out of it. they have a great list of apps that you can use with it (I recommend that you get SampleTank, and buy the whole set of instuments!).Too much fun and utility! I own lots of guitars, and this has become one of my favorites! Very cool. Thanks, Jamstik!</p>

<h5 id="set-your-expectations-its-really-cool-looking">Set Your Expectations - its really cool looking &hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>$300 for the &ldquo;guitar curious&rdquo; is a significant investment, esp. when you can get a $100 learners guitar kit from Fender or Yamaha, that does not require any fiddling with a iPAD or iPHONE. I am a mid-level experienced player, and IMHO, this item is suited for experienced musicians who want to use a guitar shaped device for MIDI inputs; -and- who have plenty of time and patience to experiment with it (which can be Very fun). But, for guitar players that are looking for a &ldquo;traveler&rdquo; guitar, there are several caveats. The strings have a high-tension, more like a mandolin than a guitar - it feels funny when strumming/picking. The included strap-buttons are plastic snap-ins that can pop out; no threads exist for real strap buttons. Only 5 frets are available; so to go &lsquo;up&rsquo; the neck (like for a solo) you have to access an akwardly placed control pad and press a up button to go up in scale. There IS some noticeable Latency between pick and sound. It is possibly compatible with iRIG and Amplitube, using a MIDI connector app (Audiobus). Also, playing the JamStik with basic Garageband is not satisfying - you need to download the available guitar and amp models so you can at least get close to using it to sound like an electric guitar. Documentation with the unit is a small pamphlet (and in the JAMConnect app..) is focused on getting the wireless connection working with the iPAD. Usage info on the Zivik/JamStik website is sparse (and there is no &ldquo;list of 100s of compatible apps&rdquo;) and no specific instructions on how to use it with iRIG and Amplitube etc. It is frustrating to setup and most of all start using.They could have made a <em>much better experience</em> by spending a FEW HOURS writing up some clear instructions on what apps are needed to actually get the unit to play, -and- some actual examples of playing and doing things like solos or just some basic songs. The JAMTutor app is so basic that it was a waste of time - much better &ldquo;begining guitar playing&rdquo; tutorials are available on YouTube. Also, the chord reader did not seem to recognize 7ths and 5ths of common open chords.The D-pad controller is not quite like a Guitar-hero/Rockband game-pad, and the usb and midi <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> jack are in weird locations.Also, in spite of claims of being noiseless, the strings are tinky and twangy to anyone sitting within about 8 feet of you; I have a traveler ultralight guitar which is much quieter when unplugged.They do include a Guitar-hero like tutoring game, but the latency was weird - like a GH controller fixing to go bad. I am not 100% sure how you can actually interface the JamStik to a game - and they DO NOT include any clear documentation on how to do so.Overall, it reminded me (somewhat) of an extremely short version of the Yamaha &ldquo;teaching guitar&rdquo; that was sold by Shaper Image in the 1990s.AGAIN - if you have a home studio set up and are MIDI knowledgable and ready for a great alternative input device - this can be a BLAST. If you are trying to learn guitar, I honestly think there are better alternatives for you. If you are a player looking for an interesting axe to add to your quiver, try it out for a few weeks, but be aware of its eccentricities.</p>

<p>I liked the idea of this thing but you cannot play it like a guitar at all, it does not allow you to do slides, hammer ons, or harmonics.. Basically only for chords and no style</p>

<p>It connects easily, sounds great, is fun and the lessons using an arcade type video screen make practice enjoyable.</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Read some negative reviews. Turns out Bluetooth was never made to transmit this much info. Used a wired connection and no delay. Sensitivity to the instrument seems better the more I play. Also, I&rsquo;m thinking the more I play, the better I learn what it takes to play this instrument. Great lessons on apps. Only one app I&rsquo;ve had a problem with. I like that I can take it with me on my motorcycle and so little space is taken up.</p>

<h5 id="play-it-plugged-or-in-plugged">Play it plugged or in plugged.</h5>

<p>What a great little instrument. I use it to practice my guitar when I&rsquo;m away from home or in my bed at night. I just plug in my headphones and play.</p>
