<h5 id="yi-uses-these-cameras-to-collect-unneeded-information">YI uses these cameras to collect unneeded information.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Collects data, passwords, browsing history, time spent on websites unrelated to the company, etc&hellip;I had these cameras for about 2 weeks. They were exactly what I needed and I really liked the image quality.After an app update I read the &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo;. I will post screen caps of it. It doesn&rsquo;t match the one posted on the website. it states that they collect information ,including browsing history, passwords, etc&hellip;, and stores the info on the servers. It also states they&rsquo;d can share it with third parties. There is no need for that. Returned these for a refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="was-great-until-latest-firmware-201604071151-now-it-s-awefull">Was great until latest firmware (201604071151) , now it&rsquo;s awefull.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got these cameras a few weeks ago, two of them..Really liked these cameras, worked very well and would have given them 5 stars.. until the latest firmware update. (1.8.6.1B_201604071151). Now the night mode is almost useless, the quality of the night images are terrible - they used to be very sharp and clear. Now it&rsquo;s nothing but fuzzy and blurry on both cameras. Also recorded video used to be smooth, now it&rsquo;s choppy and dropping frames on both of them. No way to restore to previous firmware, sent an e-mail to support no response. If you already have one of these DO NOT UPDATE TO 1.8.6.1B_201604071151 firmware!!.*UPDATE <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub> I did get a response back finally from support, they sent me the previous firmware, and I uploaded it to both cameras and now the night vision is sharp again. I attached two photos from the same camera, you can clearly see the loss of detail, exposure and usefullness that firmware 201604071151 caused. The working firmware they gave me is 201601071352 and I&rsquo;m happy with this older version. Hopefully they will fix this in a new firmware release.Update 9/1/2016 They have still not released any new firmware since the broken 201604071151 firmware to resolve the quality issue, they seem have have dropped any development or support of this camera and only are supporting their newer YI Home camera 2 and the new pan tilt. So the only fix is to load the older firmware and never update.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="warning">Warning!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>have used the two cameras in my home for about two months now. Recently, a pop up appears that says I must agree to their Privacy terms which I have read. It states that YI server can record you and your family in your home for up to 6 seconds at a time and can share the videos too. I am not okay with that. I refuse to agree, and now my cameras are useless. Because I will not agree to their terms, I cannot access the cameras I purchased. I have contacted YI to have the pop up removed but they are giving me the run around. &ldquo;Sorry, we need to consult with our legal and tech support to see what we can do.&rdquo; Still waiting for an answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="privacy-concerns">Privacy concerns</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Would be an excellent camera if it were customizable (it&rsquo;s not). I also tried the iOS app along with the android version. Why in the world would an IP camera need access to my contacts, my browsing history and bookmarks, or device ID &amp; call information? Also, the privacy policy is ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-did-the-research-for-you">I did the research for you</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I did the research for you. Let me tell you. I tried zmodo cameras. I tried ezviz cameras. I tried Samsung and tp link. I have also tried various ip cameras. They all worked okay. But had issues. Lastly I tried yi.If you read other reviews that complain of 6 second clips, I assure you, all you need to do is click on &ldquo;view full clip&rdquo;. You will have video of the entire motion. You do not need cloud service. I have three yi cams with 8gb cards. And with all the motion at my place, it works fine. I am uploading a video that shows a stranger looking in my mailbox in the middle of the night. In addition, you can see they work fine looking out of a window. So long as the night vision is turned off.</p>

<h5 id="privacy-infringement-by-yi-details-disclosed-only-2-months-after-these-cameras-are-sold">PRIVACY INFRINGEMENT BY YI (Details disclosed only 2 months after these cameras are sold)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 2 months of getting this crap from CHINA, today I am unable to login and view the images captured by camera. The reason is, YI is demanding me that I should (accept an agreement) allow YI to access all the images and data captured on my camera. THIS IS DIRECT INFRINGEMENT of privacy policy. Not sure why AMAZON allows such products to be sold in US since it directly violates basic privacy of its customers, but these details are not initially disclosed when we bought these cameras. Have sent customer support an email to refund the cost of this camera. I really believe all the affected customer should file a lawsuit against this company, but the reality of the situation is no one of us have enough time to fight over a few hundreds of dollars because of this, these companies devise policies to mess with US customers and demand access to private information.</p>
