<h5 id="best-pruveeo-cam-great-dual-functionality">Best Pruveeo Cam, great dual functionality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and operate. Quality design and clear picture. Had questions before buying and seller responded quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best $100 I ever spent</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-overall">Very nice overall!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Two small things that reduce it a half a star so I would rate this as a 4.5 :)Received this as a replacement to another model. Customer service seems really good!I really like it overall. The front video is nice.The rear is low rez but good enough to see what happened in an accident.The viewfinder is at a weird angle. I have this mounted on the very top of my windshield next to my mirror. I have to duck down to view it from a lower angle or else the image is not view-able clearly. Viewing any LCD display will do that off angle. If I could tilt it up I would but then it would not mount flush to the window. Maybe I can add a shim of some sort.If I simply mounted it lower it may be worse.Update: I removed another half star because this model does the same thing the other one did, it won&rsquo;t allow you to record a loop filling the entire card. You can record in a 10 min loop or until the card is full. Once full you have to reformat the card to start recording again. Kind of hard to do while driving. ;)I want one that can record until the entire card is full then it overwrites the old files as it goes. Being limited to a 10 min loop is not utilizing the entire card. Why support up to a 128GB card when you cannot really use that space properly?</p>

<h5 id="pruveeo-v7-so-far-is-the-best-camera-i-have-used-in-the-car">Pruveeo V7 so far is the best camera I have used in the car</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pruveeo V7 so far is the best camera I have used in the car. Setup is simple and works out of box. I like the fact that you can both timestamp date/time as well as license plate. I have more then one vehicle. Rearview is a good feature to have as an addon. I have it mounted from inside the car. Will upload videos from actual camera once I have a few more drives around the block. So far perfect in both day/night conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-dvr">Very good dvr</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Writing review after testing it in day/night combination.Pros:Very wide angle - actually it has the largest angle compared to my previous cams.WDR - when you enters tunnels or parking areas where the light conditions are different the contrast( may be other parameters) changes very quickly. Again works better then my other dvrs.Night time video - actually you cant read the plate numbers but all the signs, light colors, everything else is clearly visible.Second camera - the video quality is average but overall it is good addition.Cons:The led always is flashing indicating that it is in recording mode. Will be good if it can be turned off because it is a bit annoying at night.Update:deleting attached night time video because amazon gradually decreased it&rsquo;s quality</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Dash Cam works perfectly for me. I needed something that would record the inside of the car as well as the outside. I am a driver for Uber and Lyft and wanted to make sure I can document any activity inside and outside of the car. The videos are perfect and you can see everything you need to see. The only issue is at night if you are driving outside the city and there are no street lights it&rsquo;s a little more difficult to see inside the car. I&rsquo;m considering adding some interior lighting so the inside of the car is visible on the recordings.</p>

<h5 id="great-v7-dual-unit-you-get-a-great-bang-for-your-buck">Great V7 dual unit, you get a great bang for your buck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great V7 dual unit. Works as described, great pic and voice quality. Decided to use the rear cam inside as I drive, wanted to capture the rear passenger(s). It works better then I expected. Great unit and highly recommend. My units rear cam came as square, so be prepared that could come either way (round/square). I originally​ started with the mx2 unit ( Nice looking unit but didn&rsquo;t meet my needs). See pics of unit I&rsquo;ve attached. Thanks Pruveeo Team for your great customer service, you&rsquo;ve got a customer for life.</p>

<h5 id="i-tried-moving-around-the-camera-but-the-white-glare-looks-like-cloud-doe-not-go-away">I tried moving around the camera but the white glare (looks like cloud) doe not go away</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> for some reason there is white glare on the left bottom when it is using at night.I tried moving around the camera but the white glare (looks like cloud) doe not go away.You get what you paid for. Also the angle when you put it on windshield make it harder to review the screen.I had to add a wedge, which helpsupdate 8/11/17: Pruveeo customer service contacted me to get more information and offer resolution. I am glad they did. I upload the hazy white cloudy on the left bottom I am talking about. Hopefully I got some resolution on this because I bought V7 and F5.update 8/20/2017 Sherlock from Cust service came to the rescue. He did send me a replacement for my V7 at no charge. This new unit is working as expected. No glare. He said it could be the assembly problem.I must say their customer service response very well, I have to admit and willing to give 5 star on this respect.For sub $100 dash camera, I must say the front view camera does its job and has clarity I am looking for.The rear facing camera is rather disappointed. It does not have the clarity I am looking for and hard to work around in low light especially if you put it near your rear mirror at the driver seat. During the day the glare from the sunlight affect the picture and looks bright.Overall I am happy to recommend this camera with 1080p and sub $100.The shape and position it is a preference I guess. I hope it will not fall off after a while because of the heat.Change the stars for 2 to 4 stars.Attached are comparison between front vs rear camera (as you can see that rear camera is too bright and has no clarity)</p>
