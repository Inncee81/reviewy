<h5 id="great-camera">Great camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use. High quality pictures. Did miss a couple elk, but they seemed to be moving extremely fast so most cameras probably wouldnt have been able to snap clear pictures.</p>

<h5 id="bushnell-24-mp-trophy-cam-vs-the-bushnell-14-mp-trophy-cam-the-24-mp-wins">Bushnell 24 MP Trophy Cam vs the Bushnell 14 MP Trophy Cam&hellip; The 24 MP wins!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I compared the Bushnell 24MP trophy cam to the Bushnell 14MP Trophy Cam HD Aggressor Low Glow Trail Camera, Brown which I also own.The new Bushnell 24 MP is a great option for a trail camera or a decent alternative option for home security.FIT AND FINISH: The housing is solid plastic with a single latch on the side with holes in the back for mounting with the included strap or for locking it with a cable (Primos Truth Master Python Adjustable Trail Cam Cable Lock) which I use so it won&rsquo;t get stolen.It needs AA batteries (not included) . They recommend Lithium batteries but those are really expensive so I used standard Duracell AA.It doesn&rsquo;t come with an SD card I bought a 32GB SDHC.There is a color screen on the inside with live view which is nice. The outer housing is exactly the same as the 14MP version so it&rsquo;s a tie here.It&rsquo;s a Tie as far as build quality as the outer housing is exactly the same.VIDEO AND PICTURES QUALITY:The 0.2 second shutter lag is great but it still won&rsquo;t really capture an animal running perpendicular to the camera unless it moves slowly.The video quality and color during the day is great and decent at night (see pics).There are many false alarms where it takes pictures and video of nothing at all. You can set the selectivity of the camera to motion and IR but you will still get an lot of empty landscapes.The viewing angle is widescreen but it would be better if they could put a fish eye lens on this camera.Picture quality is better on the 24 MP version and the color screen is an improvement.Battery life is supposed to be one year but that is difficult to test.At night, there is NO glow from the camera unlike some cheaper models.OVERALL:A decent trail/ game camera that you can also use for home security. Could be 5 stars if there were less false alarms with empty landscapes and a better viewing angle. This is a definite improvement over the 14MP Bushnell Trophy Cam.</p>

<p>Great camera, good price.</p>

<h5 id="a-couple-stand-out-features-over-other-trail-cams">A couple stand-out features over other trail cams</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Stealth Cam G45NG for years and have been happy with it. Both this Bushnell and the G45NG have good build quality and will effectively get your pics. Almost all the features are roughly equivalent, however there do exist some potentially significant differences as I will explain.Features that favor the Bushnell:-Bushnell has a tiny LCD screen which allows you to view the pics. Given the small size and poor resolution, you can&rsquo;t use it as your primary viewer, but it is very useful to check if the camera is working and is pointing exactly where you want it.-Bushnell easily accepts any standard mount such as the VideoSecu Metal Wall Mounts which I use. In either case, I would strongly recommend some kind of screw-in mount instead of the almost-worthless tree strap which does does not allow you to adjust the cam.Feature that favors the StealthCam:-DVR feature which means if the SD card is full, new pics will overwrite the oldest pics. This feature is great but is only really necessary if you have a small SD card and fill it up regularly. If you have a 32gb card, it can store at least 5000 pics which is a lot.OVERALLWhile the StealthCam has served me well for years and is an excellent choice, I slightly favor the Bushnell because it is more compatible with mounts and has an LCD screen.</p>

<h5 id="high-quality-pictures-video-but-has-quality-issues-and-video-setting-limitations">High Quality Pictures/Video but has Quality Issues and Video Setting Limitations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camera a month ago and it captured very good videos and pictures. I am having to send it back today as the display screen in the camera stopped working. While the screen is dead the camera was still recording videos.Pros:Very high quality video and pictures: I did not use the highest quality video settings to save card space and still these videos were better than the other cameras I currently use.Great night vision range.Very fast trigger and less missed videos or videos of animal butts. :)Battery life: I only used for a month and with the display screen I could not see what the battery meter said they were at. I did put the batteries in another cam and it reports full batteries even after a month of use. The batteries had 330+ videos of varying length 5-30 seconds and a mix of about <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> day verus night videos.Cons:Video mode has no way to set video length. lots of setting for pictures but very limited on the video mode.Quality: while I only had in the woods for 3 weeks the screen only last about 2.5 weeks. There was plenty of rain during this time but temps were between 50-90 degrees so nothing that should caused camera environmental issues.While they would replace the camera I do not feel comfortable replacing it. If the next one fails I am stuck in the constant return game every time something breaks until the warranty is up. If I had more faith in Bushnell I might chance replacing it but this product follows the trends of other Bushnell products having quality issues I have experienced.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about Bushnell cameras. When they work, they take good pictures. But another NEW camera simply shut off with brand new batteries installed which angered me&hellip;</p>
