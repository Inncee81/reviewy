<h5 id="nice-fan-false-info-in-the-listing-but-still-useable-i-tried-to-put-all-the-info-i-could-find-about-the-fan-in-the-review">Nice fan, false info in the listing, but still useable. I tried to put all the info I could find about the fan in the review.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will try to cover everything that I know, but I will say this from the start. Some of the info on the listing, is just wrong about the fans. My review is going to be a bit long too, because I am going to try an include the specs on the fan, so you know what they are, all in one place.First, if you, like me, prefer to buy made in the USA stuff, then let me say, this is NOT one of them. I bought this one because it said, &ldquo;Origin: USA&rdquo;. I got them in, and found that both the box, and the fans, both say made in china on them.I got 2 of these, and found that they were not equal in the amount of power that they use. Since they have a surge of power when you first turn them on, I will give you the readings on them after they were running for about 30 seconds. Fan 1, then 2 respectively. High 49.7, 51.5 watts. Low 35.8, 34.9 watts. I am just letting you know not to expect an exact number, because each fan uses a different amount of power. I saw one person put that theirs uses 53 watts on high. So all you can get is an estimate on these.The power cord is an 18AWG cable, and is 5&rsquo; or 5 foot long. It is just a standard, 2 plug end.The fan blades are around 6 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; wide, each. They are both made out of plastic. They do produce a good amount of air flow too. I would say, on low, it would probably be comparable to a standard window air conditioner&rsquo;s fan on high. It is hard to really give an accurate amount as things very too much, but it does give a good breeze, even on low. There is no information, anywhere on the fan, or in the manual, to tell what the CFM rating is for the air flow. I looked. Both fans also run together. There is no way to turn one off. It is all or nothing.The noise level of the fans is moderate. It is a typical fan sound, from the cutting of the blades into the air, type of sound. Basically the sound level is one that is plenty tolerable to be able to use it in a window, in say, a bedroom, or in a living room, and be able to watch TV at the same time. I would say that this fan on high, is probably about the noise level of my quieter window air conditions, just on fan, on low.. You do not hear much, if any noise, from the motors.They say that these are reversible, and the pictures make it look like there is a switch to do it. But, there is no switch. You have to manually turn the whole fan around to reverse the air flow. There is a switch on the top, on both sides, for you to control the speed, from high to low to off. They are not independent switches. There is one switch in the middle of the fan, and a plastic lever that extends to the outside of the fan on both sides.The fan size is 10&rdquo; high, 21 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; long (about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; of that is the lip to attach the side extension too), and that is with no side extensions in use. One side of the fan has an accordion type of extension, and the other side has a solid extension that slides down on that lip. It comes with one solid extension, but looks to be made so that you can attach multiple of them together, but I have found no way to buy more of them. Each side, the extensions come up to about 5&rdquo; of extension per side, for a total of about 10&rdquo; in extension, for a total width, or length of the fan, at around 31&rdquo; max.It does come with a 1 year warranty too, just like is stated in the listing.The weight of the fan is pretty light too.. Maybe 2 pounds.. Not surprising since just about the whole fan is made out of plastic.I bought these to save on electric, so I can put them in the window, and turn them on at night, to pull the warmer air out of the house, and pull the cooler night air in, and then I just close the windows during the day. I would say it is worth it, vs running an air condition, when you take into consideration that these use around 50 watts on high, vs an air conditioner that uses over around 500 watts with just the fan, and well over 1000 watts when using the AC part of it too.I have only tested mine out so far, so if I have any problems, I will update. My opinion about it. I do like the fan, and I will get a lot of use out of them. I wish that they were made in the USA like they are advertised to be, and I wish I could have gotten some info about how much air flow they give off too. A switch to reverse the blades, instead of having to turn the whole fan around, would be nice too. But, for the most part, I am happy with them.. At least, so far. I took off one star due to false information on where they were made, and lack of info about air flow, noise levels, etc, without having to look through tons of customer reviews and questions.</p>

<h5 id="big-help-on-hot-evenings-nights">Big help on hot evenings/nights.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For under $20, you get almost instant additional cooling without running expensive ac. The unit is really light and runs fairly quietly (much like running a stand fan on high setting). You get better cooling efficiency in a larger space (like living room) when you couple this fan with couple of indoor fans or if there is a ceiling fan. I have a ceiling fan in my kitchen area with a high ceiling and, on hot days, the ceiling fan by itself doesn&rsquo;t cool things down much because all it does is move the hot air below the ceiling. By having this window fan running, the ceiling fan now circulates the colder air from the outside and the efficiency of cooling goes up markedly. Of course, if it&rsquo;s during the day when outside is 95 plus degrees, it&rsquo;ll do you little good. The key is to run it in the evening when the outside temperature is much lower than inside of the house which has held the daytime heat. When I get home late afternoon, the accumulated heat and stale air in the house makes it at least 15 degrees hotter than the outside so running this fan has made cooling much faster. I have sliding windows which allows me to just place the fan on the opening then use the sliding window to hold it in place (doesn&rsquo;t take much to hold the fan in place since it&rsquo;s so light and it runs vibration-free). I just lift the fan out and move it into my bedroom before sleep time.</p>

<h5 id="its-super-small-and-the-spacer-that-comes-with-it-doesn-t">Its super small and the spacer that comes with it doesn&rsquo;t &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ive had this fan for a few months now and I think it works for the most part. Its super small and the spacer that comes with it doesn&rsquo;t serve a purpose in my window. I have about a one foot gap of &ldquo;no fan&rdquo; when its in my window. It doesn&rsquo;t have a reverse button so you have to physically turn the fan when you want the air to move in or out which doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all. It cools down my room just enough since my air conditioner is in the living room it helps circulate the air a bit more. Had I paid attention to the size I think I would have preferred a taller fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-don-t-recommend-it">I don&rsquo;t recommend it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has a maximum window width of 32 inches, unless one buys hard-to-find extenders. I will make my own.It is very noisy compared to the much older Holmes fan with thermostat it will replace. The old one is being replaced because the thermostatic switch became erratic and not always functional, but it was over a dozen years old. I believe it was manufactured before the company was sold to Jarden. This fan is made in China, and it is of rather low quality compared to older Holmes products.Basically, I am disappointed in this fan, this purchase, and, if it were from a local store, I would return it. However, I did read all the reviewsbefore ordering, and it is not Amazon&rsquo;s fault. I won&rsquo;t order another Holmes fan and I don&rsquo;t recommend this one unless it is to be used in an area where the noise is not a problem and the window is under 32 inches wide.Who knows how long it will last? I just put it into service today, 10 January 2017.</p>

<h5 id="entry-level-fan-that-does-the-job">Entry Level Fan That Does The Job..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dual window fans are a good thing to have here in the summer months. Especially when the house heats up and the night air outside is trapped out there and you need something to draw it in. I have had several over the years. They have a life expectancy of about 3 seasons for me before they start to act up, or get too filthy to want to use anymore. This Holmes model is just about as cheap as they come. Nothing special about it at all, just twin fans that do the job. This one is even a little cheaper than most for it doesn&rsquo;t even bother to include slide out panels for both sides, just a filler panel that may not see your fan being centered in your window if that&rsquo;s important to you. Even though the blades on this and fan openings are decent size, the unit itself is not very big so make sure to measure carefully. The only other thing about this fan that could be aggravating to some is the fact that you can&rsquo;t reverse the fans for exaust without turning it around. That&rsquo;s not a problem for me for I have never used one of these for exhaust, just to draw in outside air. Altogether an entry level fan that does the job and comes at a good price&hellip; Recommended.. : )</p>

<p>Fits in the window and I love how it can blow in both directions.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-ok-but-not-great">It&rsquo;s ok but not great</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s not worth the money. It&rsquo;s loud and by two way fan they mean pick it up and turn it around. You can buy way better stuff with a little bit more money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<p>Too noisy compare to one I had before</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-for-the-price">Not bad for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For what it is, the fan does a decent job. For my windows, the extension fits well, and it provides a nice way to bring outdoor air into the second floor on cool nights.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good. My son liked.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fits-virtually-all-windows">&ldquo;Fits Virtually All Windows&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The box says it &ldquo;Fits Virtually All Windows&rdquo;. Funny, it didn&rsquo;t fit a single window in my house.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-price-and-helps-cool-the-rooms">Good price and helps cool the rooms</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We use these for several months each year to bring cooler air into the room or to vent air outside. They work great and are easy to assemble and install.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-investment">Good investment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I live in Southern California and until recently lived in a place without AC. It may seem like a simple concept but having the warm air vacuumed out really cools down a room.</p>
