<h5 id="disappointed-misleading-weaseling-practice-to-claims">Disappointed. Misleading / Weaseling Practice to Claims</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this 4-year plan with Asurion as protection for my luggage set last November 2016, hoping that it&rsquo;s a good choice. I was wrong about Asurion, when I needed to file a claim.On my trip in April 2017, the zipper for my 27-inch luggage completely broke off and not closable at one of the airports when we were on travel, and we had to purchase a replacement luggage to continue on our trip. We took pictures of the broken luggage along with the receipt of the replacement luggage. This should satisfy as either one of the 2 conditions in the policy&rsquo;s Terms &amp; Conditions that they can either ask for (1) returned damaged product or (2) receipt of purchase of replacement luggage.However, after I filed my claim &amp; talked to the claim agent, knowing that I was on travel when the luggage broke and could not get the un-usable broken luggage back, they insisted on me to send them the broken luggage to them and refuse to use the receipt of replacement luggage purchase and pictures as the other possible condition in their policy.The protection policy is for a travel luggage. The travel luggage is used for travel. No one in their right mind would ship back an unusable luggage back home after getting a replacement luggage. It&rsquo;s just common sense. It&rsquo;s misleading to list the 2nd option to provide proof of purchase of replacement luggage (and pictures of broken luggage) as reasonable proofs for travel luggage claims.It&rsquo;s misleading and fraudulent practice to sell insurance policies and weasel their way out of paying real claims when they&rsquo;re submitted. Honest insurance companies don&rsquo;t do that.Insurance policy is only good when they plan to honor it when the insured customer files a legitimate claim. Asurion failed at that here.Avoid buying insurance from this company like a plague! I would have given it 0 star if it&rsquo;s an option.READ MORE</p>

<p>Wheels Broke off my Luggage I purchased in December through amazon prime along with insurance by Asurion. I Filed a claim online and felt pretty good as the &ldquo;Everything is covered Statement&rdquo; Makes you feel protected. Received an email from Asurion to go back to the manufacture. The manufacture wants me to go back to the airline! That might be a choice if I quit my job to devote the time to this endeavour, but That&rsquo;s why I purchased the insurance. I reported it all to Amazon Prime and they interjected on my behalf. I got the cost of the policy refunded but I am out the cost of the luggage. Please don&rsquo;t waste your money.READ MORE</p>
