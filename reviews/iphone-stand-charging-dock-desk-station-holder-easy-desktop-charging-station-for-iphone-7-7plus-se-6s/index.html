<h5 id="perfect-for-my-desk">Perfect for my desk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very modern looking stand. One thing I didn&rsquo;t do was check how thick my case was before purchasing. I used a wallet case for my iPhone 6 and it didn&rsquo;t fir the stand originally but once I took the wallet off I have to say that I love this stand.Perfect for my desk and charging fast the my OEM USB cable.Compared to the purchase of a charging cable, this is very cost-effective, it not only can charging my phone, was a perfect stand on my desk.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-charges-my-phone-super-fast-excellent-price">It charges my phone super fast. Excellent price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great dock for the price!This sits on my desk in my office at work. It works great if you have a thinner case - I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;d work with an Otterbox though.It is well made and does exactly what I wanted, helps me clean up my desk.I&rsquo;m very satisfied with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="charging-dock">Charging dock</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This charging dock is very efficient and very pretty. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and it fits on the charger nicely. It charges pretty quickly and you can still see your phone while it charges which is nice if your streaming media. It only charges with the phone vertically, it would be nice if it would fit both ways but it is still very nice to be able to watch while you charfe. I would reccomend this highly if you wish to watch and charge quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-will-be-buying-another-one-for-my-bedside">I will be buying another one for my bedside.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have wanted a stand for my iPhone forever.This product is perfect for placement in a kitchen or on a nightstand. I enjoy playing music while I cook. This provides a great docking station where I can not only charge my phone but also easily see what song is playing..its also compact enough i can take it with me when i travel&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-dock">Love the dock</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice charging dock, haven&rsquo;t had a really bad issue with it.Pros:- Firstly, the bar on the back gets really cold if you have a cold room. So because of this, it keeps your phone very cold. I have a fan in my room, the average temperature is about 60 degrees but sometimes I drop it below that and before I got this charging dock my phone would still feel like it&rsquo;s about to explode, but now with the charging dock it hasn&rsquo;t been cold since.- Charges pretty fast.Cons:- The glue on the bottom of it I personally don&rsquo;t think is that great. While it keeps it in place (like you can&rsquo;t move this at all without pushing hard..) if you want to move it around the glue will eventually wear off, I think it would&rsquo;ve been better to have rubber feet but of course this is just my opinion.Would no doubt recommend this. I bought almost $300 worth of stuff the day I ordered this, and I honestly think this is one of the best things I bought.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-charging-dock">Love this charging dock</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy set up and works great. Charges my iphone 7 fairly quickly.It fits perfectly with phones wrapped in thin silicone cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hold-on-to-your-money">Hold On to Your Money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved this product, initially. The stand is sturdy, a lot sturdier than I expected, actually. My iPhone 6S fit perfectly inside the cradle and was tilted at the perfect angle. The cord is short but thankfully, I had a longer cord with the cube already attached so there were no issues there. The charge was amazing and charged my phone really fast even with a case as long as it&rsquo;s thin. The rose gold color matches my rose gold colored phone perfectly. The bottom gripped the surface of my desk beautifully and it stayed in place.Now, here it is, less than a MONTH in and IT NO LONGER CHARGES MY PHONE!!!! I am not even kidding. It&rsquo;s a beautifully constructed piece of garbage, is what it is. It&rsquo;s a good thing it wasn&rsquo;t too late for me to return it! Please, do yourself a favor: READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Even if it&rsquo;s just a small percentage of the people who complain because more than likely, you&rsquo;ll experience the same things. Please, save your money and buy something that will actually work for longer than a month.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-dock-charger">Perfect Dock Charger!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for my iphone 7. I don&rsquo;t wear a case often so I don&rsquo;t know how it fares for people for cases. Charges really quickly and nice to be able to see any notifications without having to fumble with your phone. Only suggestion would be to have the cord longer. The color matches my iphone 7 well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-purchase">Do not purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used for one week and it no longer charges. Junk!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it-got-it-when-i-had-a-iphone">Love it! Got it when I had a iPhone &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! Got it when I had a iPhone 6sI just recently upgraded to a 7plusIt does fit ONLY if it&rsquo;s outside of the case unfortunately..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lasted-only-two-months">Lasted only Two Months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its only been two months since I purchased this charger and it is no longer charging. I leave it connected to my work computer so it should be able to charge at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really good, gave 4 stars because I have to take my phone out of the case to charge</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gift-for-someone-that-has-lots-of-mobile-devices">Great gift for someone that has lots of mobile devices.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it got so many bad reviews. I&rsquo;m not that easy to please. But it works great with my iphone 7. And there&rsquo;s an adhesive on the bottom to keep it from slipping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-charging-dock">Nice charging dock.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This charging station connects easily to my iphone 6. it works well with my thin phone cases , If your case can not work just took off it and it will connects well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-both-like-the-stand">We both like the stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my husband. We both like the stand. It works great and is very convenient!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No Issues</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="charger-stand">Charger Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s my fault for not reading the description better but I&rsquo;m unable to charge mine with a case on. Seems to work fine and a sleek design but no interest in a charger that I need&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Works perfectly</p>
