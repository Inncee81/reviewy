<h5 id="great-camera-better-than-expected-by-far">Great camera, better than expected by far.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great camera over all. Unfortunately Amazon keeps playing with the price. I was going to buy everyone in my organization one of these for this summers expedition but they keep yo-yoing the price. Seriously at $39.99 I was find with making the purchase. I bought 1 just to try it out and 3 days later they raised the price like clowns. Now they get no more sales until it goes back to $39.99 otherwise I&rsquo;m out and I&rsquo;ll buy it somewhere else for $39.99. Otherwise the quality compared to go pro is literally not a huge difference for the huge jump in price. Yeah it might not have all the voice operated perks for lazy people but seriously I would much rather press a button and know that the camera is recording for a savings of $350 than spend a crazy amount of money on a soon to be obsolete go pro. The reason I say soon to be obsolete is that I got wind of what is coming out from another company this summer. Can&rsquo;t wait. Over all the quality of this activon cx camera is very very good and we&rsquo;ll worth the money. The app works smooth if you have a good phone or tablet and the over all ease of use and battery life is solid. I would recommend this camera to anyone novice or pro. They&rsquo;re great little junk around cameras with comparable quality to go pro for the price point. If Go pro is like an 10 then activeon is like a 8 by comparison.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-recording-video-not-so-much-for-taking-photos">Great for recording video not so much for taking photos.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The digital hardware components that make up the Activeon CX Action camera all combine to create one of the best wide angle 1080P videos I have ever seen. The lens pulls in a full scene that is almost beyond my own vision. The digital processor and recording to the micro SDHC card deliver flawless videos that seem to never miss a moment. The best part is that videos are encoded as MOV files that take up very little file system space and have a single channel audio track at 48 kHz.Sadly, the same cannot be said for the pictures taken with the Activeon CX Action camera system. Initially, over 50 photos were taken with the camera while exploring our forest land. As expected the camera lens was able to generate some great wide angle photos that were impossible to take with my Apple iPhone 6. We did notice that the corners of the photos were not always in full focus but this was acceptable given that it provided so much more detail. The problems started on our second outdoor expedition to the Louisiana Longleaf Pine forest. We took many more photos and as always would turn off the camera when done. Once we downloaded the photos to a laptop and looked at them, all the photos had their bottom frames cut off. No image utility was able to correct the photos and after several emails to Activeon technical support there was no replies.The wireless mode of the camera does work and with about a 75ft range in the thick Longleaf pine forest, we were able to snap photos remotely while having the camera view find on my Apple iPhone 6. My complaint is that the wireless mode does not offer the user the ability to manually take photos from the camera itself nor does it offer the ability to see the current view on its screen.The camera will run for at least two days on a full charge with moderate use. In other words, I used the camera to review videos and left it on until it timed out on several occasions. The camera will take about 6 hours to recharge to a full charge once fully discharged.In conclusion, even though the photos taken with this action camera no longer save correctly, the videos are of such high quality that we continue to use it. The rugged plastic case is one of the best features with complete waterproof capabilities for your outdoor adventures. Due to the corrupt pictures and unresponsive customer service, I have given this product 3 stars.</p>

<h5 id="exellent">Exellent!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great features and easy to use. I chose this camera over the SJ4000, Xiaomi Yi, and Go Pro because of it&rsquo;s incomparable price and it&rsquo;s complete line of accessories. It is important that the action camcorder that one buys offers extra batteries and accessories. Activeon offer a great selection of accessories for a reasonable price, and along with the $50-100 cameras, anyone can start vlogging and capturing valuable moments.</p>

<h5 id="finally-found-what-i-was-looking-for">Finally found what I was looking for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After wasting my money on a dOvOb SJ4000 Wifi 2.0 Inch Full HD 1080P 12MP Waterproof Action Camera (Black) with Battery Charger and 2 Batteries and an APEMAN Action Camera Full HD 1080P Waterproof Action Cam LCD Screen 170° Ultra Wide-Angle Len Sport Camera action camera, I finally found what I was looking for in this camera. I only wish I had started with this camera instead. I have read and seen many people happy with the SJ4000, but it is becoming fairly difficult to find a real SJ4000. The two versions listed above are complete junk, and definitely not true SJ4000s. When you can&rsquo;t find a good knockoff of a knockoff of a GoPro what kind of world are we living in?The Activeon CX has much higher image quality and features than I expected in this price range. Right out of the box compared to the other two SJ copies you can immediately tell that these are much higher quality. Large bright display, and more options and settings that the SJ clones by far. Rather than BS you with ridiculous claims of &ldquo;12 MP&rdquo; images, this camera only has 5 MP. But, it seems to actually be 5 MP. Not a small image stretched to some larger amount of pixels like the junk cameras. Shooting in the different still modes does show a difference in image detail unlike the SJ clones. It also has a much better mobile app and manual than the others. You&rsquo;ll find many reviews videos on YT for the CX. I highly recommend it if your looking for 80% of a GoPro at 20% of the price.</p>

<p>Decent little camera! Pics a little grainy for really serious non-You Tube level projects, but has a huge field of view which is selectable. The wi-fi doesn&rsquo;t work well with my Asus tablet, but the screen on the camera gets the job done. I&rsquo;m mostly using this camera mounted on the end of a guitar to add more viewing angles to my concert &amp; studio videos.</p>
