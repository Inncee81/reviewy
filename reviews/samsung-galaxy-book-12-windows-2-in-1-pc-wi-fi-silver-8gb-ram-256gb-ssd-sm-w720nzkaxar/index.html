<h5 id="early-impressions">Early impressions</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received my Galaxy Book a few hours ago and wanted to share some early impressions. I bought and returned the previous version Galaxy Tab Pro S earlier in the week because of the good discounts. I had difficulties with the Galaxy Tab Pro S Bluetooth and also the computer didn&rsquo;t feel snappy. I set out to find anther computer and ended up ordering the Galaxy Book with 8gb RAM and 256gb SSD.Some early impression is its much better than its predecessor. I really like having an active cooling system with a fan. I have a fan-less core M Lenovo and it throttles a lot. So far the Galaxy Book seems to be able to maintain a good temperature for the CPU. The SSD is fast 553mb/s read 524mb/s write. The screen of course is fantastic as its AMOLED.Samsung has moved its software and driver updates to Windows update but there still is a notification icon and service running. After first boot I ran Windows update, the system rebooted and did a few firmware updates and then some Windows updates. I thought this was nice rather than a stand alone application for Samsung software.Battery life -The Samsung Galaxy Book 12 has a 40,040 mWh battery (as seen using BatteryBar Pro) that gives 11 hours of video playback. Compared to other 2-in-1s that have attached keyboards with 60Wh (60,000mWh) the Galaxy Book can not compete. I would assume 40,040 mWh is the best Samsung could do because of the size of the tablet and fitting in a fan. There is definitely a trade off for this tablet in battery life. One way to look at is, if Samsung could fit a 60Wh theatrically the video playback would be 16.5 hours. I don&rsquo;t think the lower battery life is due to Samsung&rsquo;s bad engineering or bad implementation, its more a limit of a tablet form factor.I am really impressed with the battery life while using the computer with very light usage. Microsoft and Samsung have done a great job of limiting CPU usage while the computer is on battery power only. Since the AMOLED display doesn&rsquo;t use a backlight battery life is extended. Black is the most power efficient color on AMOLED screens. Black themes and background should help with battery life. One article I saw said AMOLED was 15-20% more efficient than backlit and up to 50% more efficient when using mostly black.Samsung claims 11 hours of video playback on a singe charge. I downloaded a 4k video clip and looped it with Microsoft&rsquo;s built in video player with sound off. I only went down to 50% battery life, the results was 5 hours 30 minutes. So 11 hours seems about right. I will write more about normal usage.Connected standby battery drain (sleep) - First long connected standby session result was 3% drain over 10.5 hours Second long connected standby session result 3% drain over 8 hours.I have rated it at 4 stars currently, I feel it really needs to impress for its price tag, time will tell.Some areas I will try to write about in the future.Keyboard - Backlit with some flex towards the center back. No batteries needed or no Bluetooth thanks to the pogo connector.Trackpad - Nice so farS-Pen - No batteries needed and smoothWi-Fi and Bluetooth - so far so good.Portability -Also beware of sellers charging more than MSRP.Feel free to ask questions and I try my best to answer.</p>

<h5 id="premium-windows-tablet-everything-else-is-subjective">PREMIUM Windows Tablet - everything else is subjective.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off with a little backstory - and my quest for the perfect device. Is there a PERFECT device??? NOT yet, although I am very pleased with Sammy&rsquo;s latest offering.I started off with a Samsung Note Pro 12.2&rdquo; tablet. I still have it, but running Android 5.1, it is getting a bit long in the tooth. My needs - I am a road warrior, so I am looking for portability above everything else. I HAD the Note Pro mounted in my truck, running with a Verizon LTE jetpack for connectivity. It navigates mostly with Google Maps. I&rsquo;ve tried to run full-blown office on it before, but have found the Android versions of Excel especially somewhat limiting. We&rsquo;ll just leave it as several years old and in need of a replacement.Sooooo&hellip; I turned to Surface. Actually waited for the SP4 specs to come out and was VERY disappointed because it did not include a GPS chip. Seriously - $5 GPS chip and the Surface would have worked perfectly for what I needed. Ended up buying a refurbed SP3 with a SP4 keyboard, based solely on price and it carries the load of the &ldquo;business needs&rdquo;. It is full up windows and runs office and all real business software.Major CON with this scenario - two devices, two OSs, etc.Fast Forward to today and the new Galaxy Book. GORGEOUS DISPLAY, very responsive in the 256 / 8 GB version, back-lit keyboard, nice touchpad, FULL WINDOWS AND A GPS CHIP!!! Finally, a device that fits my &ldquo;specs&rdquo; requirement.Windows - runs office (the real deal) very wellSuper AMOLED display - works well outdoors and mounted in my truckKeyboard / case - works well when not mounted in the carBluetooth - Use a simple Logitech k830 BT keyboard when mounted in the truckGPS chip - works well with Sygic GPS nav (don&rsquo;t get me started on Google vs Microsoft)Some of the more &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; topics:Multi-fold case vs kickstand - yes, I will give Microsoft props for the kickstand. Not sure what to do with the Galaxy Book when NOT docked in the truck, other than to attach the keyboard / case. Will be interested to see what 3rd parties come out with for a keyboard-less case. Ideally I would love to see a magnetic back that snaps on and has a kickstand. YES, I have used it on my lap and it works fine. It is quite stable and really works just as well as the Microsoft kickstandUSB-C Implementation - It IS the future. Get used to it. Yes, a dongle is required to get to HDMI and USB 3.0. But with the TWO USB-C connectors, charging is never an issue.FLAT keyboard - I&rsquo;ve used both, flat type case on Galaxy Note pro and Microsoft&rsquo;s slightly angled type case. I do prefer the slight angle, but it has never been a real issue. Thank God it is finally back-lit!!! I was very disappointed with the Note Pro keyboard for its lack of back lighting.Not sure if the case is plastic or metal or what&hellip; It is very nice and this is definitely a PREMIUM tablet. If you have Apple stock - you should sell. Samsung is killing them with innovation, and they are definitely stagnant. This machine beats the iPad Pro every day of the week and twice on Sunday. Will be interested to see what the newly announced Surface Pro (no longer numbered) has to offer. Perhaps they will include the long awaited GPS and LTE chipsets. It would be nice of Samsung to release this product with a <sup>256</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> GB PLUS LTE configuration. We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Poor man&rsquo;s Cintiq Companion, without not much negativity. I was lucky enough to buy a refurbished one with almost half a price. If you are doing some conceptual sketches with Clip Studio Paint or Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, this is a pretty decent product to purchase. But you might want to buy a third-party bluetooth keyboard, especially if you happened to purchase a rugged rubber case from Verizon like I did. Considering that the tablet PC is rather fragile, you might want that case, too. I was wondering why no one but Verizon OEM was making rugged cases for Galaxy Books, BTW.Obviously you can&rsquo;t work on some large images with many layers since the RAM is only 4GB. But if you are doing some lighter illustrations or graphic novel inking on the go this will be a decent alternative for Cintiq Companion or even MobileStudio Pro. Having said that, if Samsung makes a 15 inch version of Galaxy Book, I would puchase one within a heartbeat.</p>
