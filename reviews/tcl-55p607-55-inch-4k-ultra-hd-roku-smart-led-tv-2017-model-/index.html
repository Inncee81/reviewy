<p>REVIEW UPDATE 7/28/17: The firmware has been updated as of 7/27/17 that adds FALD (local dimming) while in GAME MODE! I have had a chance to test it out, again with a rhythm game, and can confirm the input lag (or lack thereof LOL) seems exactly the same even with this new addition. This TV keeps getting better and better. Original review below&hellip;First off, I&rsquo;m not a 4K TV expert, and this is my first one, so pardon my excitement but I am stunned at how awesome this is. Bright, clear as day, and black that looks very black. I have just only set it up and put some streaming services to use (like Amazon Prime video for 4K HDR stuff).Easy to set up, it took like 10 minutes to install and get all logged in and firmware updated. Roku TV interface is super snappy and quick. Remote is awesome, has voice search, and even has a headphone jack to listen by yourself. Comes with earbuds too :)One thing I appreciate a lot, is if the TV detects an HDR or a Dolby Vision signal, the logo appears up in the corner for a few seconds. So there&rsquo;s no question!I got the set primarily for gaming, since 4K is the new hotness. Everything is very snappy&hellip; switching between the different HDMI inputs and such. I really like the Roku TV interface. I&rsquo;m coming from a 2014 Sony 1080p TV.I played around with a few settings (they save between inputs so that is nice), like putting the darkness down a couple notches, turning color up a bit to my liking, but that&rsquo;s all the tweaking I&rsquo;ve done. There&rsquo;s a Roku TV app that lets you really get nitty gritty, but I&rsquo;ll wait until a pro provides some settings. There is a game mode for every input, but I have not used it yet. Haven&rsquo;t experienced anything bad so I am thinking whatever input lag is very small.I don&rsquo;t have a 4K receiver, so the Xbox One S and PS4 Pro went to inputs one and two direct, with optical cable out to receiver (also supports Arc, maybe I&rsquo;ll set that up), and then the Switch, WiiU, and PS3 go through the receiver and to the TV, since they aren&rsquo;t 4K anyway.There&rsquo;s many settings when HDR is activated (and you can tell the TV has switched because it will say HDR in the corner for a few seconds, even for games, or have the Dolby Vision logo). I don&rsquo;t know what they all do yet or which is the preferred for each instance, but the overall look does change when switching between them&hellip; there&rsquo;s HDR Dark, HDR Normal, HDR Bright, and the same for Dolby Vision. It saves all your settings even if you go back and forth between HDR and non-hdr so that&rsquo;s nice&hellip; once HDR kicks in it goes to your settings for that.FIRST I wanted to see if there was any &ldquo;blooming&rdquo; or whatever people say. This set is FALD with 72 zones apparently. Like if there&rsquo;s something against what should be a completely dark screen would get a halo of light around it, so I found a Dolby logo. It passes the test. I don&rsquo;t see any blooming, the dang thing is a black screen!Tried out some Forza Horizon 3 in HDR. I am used to my old TV being in TORCH MODE because that&rsquo;s all I could do to get it looking good. This looks very natural and more real.I then popped in Planet Earth II 4K Blu-ray on the One S for a few minutes, and wow.Next up is WipeOut Omega Collection on PS4 Pro, which is native 4K 60fps. Looks great, and again much more real looking than my old torch mode tv.Booted up the Switch to see if there were any &ldquo;upscaling&rdquo; problems, and everything looked great. Tried out Shantae. I looked during the cutscenes to see if there was any &ldquo;light bleeding&rdquo; into the letterbox area, but it was completely clean.I&rsquo;ve attached some photos of my testing from today.Very satisfied with this purchase! Amazing value for all this set can do!EDIT: Regarding input lag and not having the option for FALD in game mode&hellip; I set up HDMI ARC to my receiver just now, and decided to put a rhythm game to the test. If anything would show lag it would be a rhythm game. This is with game mode turned OFF. I tested Superbeat Xonic on the PS4 Pro. I hit every note exactly. There is an option in the Xonic menu to calibrate lag, and I did not need it, it is set to 0ms. Now I am positive this set doesn&rsquo;t have zero input lag, but in my case it might as well be. No reason for me to even use game mode. Amazing.</p>

<p>Fantastic Picture Quality! I, as many others here were in the pre-order status when purchasing this 4k TV. When it became available there was a mass shipment to all parts of the country. I think this is the reason for some of the poor reviews (damage during shipping). There may be some validity to some of the reviews stating problems with backlight bleeding. I would classify it more accurately (IMO) as clouding or flashlighting which is common with LED panels. Now unless you&rsquo;re going to sit in front of the TV staring at a black screen this will not be a problem in normal viewing. I would have never noticed or tested for it (YOUTUBE Backlight bleed test) until so-called experts on a forum made this a &ldquo;panic&rdquo; issue. As I said, and looking at the samples that youtube provided after the test..it is really not light bleed in most cases. I feel sorry for the people that received damaged units and possibly legitimate defective issues&hellip;but i don&rsquo;t think they are as prevalent as some of these low ratings would indicate.The TV is mostly plastic with black borders and gunmetal strips inserted on the sides&hellip;not a premium look but quite nice-looking. Power it on and you will be completely surprised at the quality for the price! Bright with deep blacks and great contrast. The 72 zone local dimming works as reviews have stated. Even without the local dimming on it has very good native contrast. The colors really pop! There are some 4k demos on You Tube that really showcase the TV. The menu settings are very easy to navigate as well. I had my neighbor over to check it out and they were so impressed that they called Best Buy to order when available later this month. They are sporadically available here on Amazon&hellip;but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be here sooner than the specified wait period. Our pre-orders arrived much sooner than initially thought. I am still in awe every time I power on the TV..that I received so much for so little. The old adage that &ldquo;you get what you pay for&rdquo; DOES NOT hold true in this case. You get much more for what you pay. I believe TCL is marketing at such a low introductory cost so as to get a foothold in the USA market (not easy going up against behemoths like Samsung, Sony, LG).In summary..I am totally satisfied with this TCL 4k TV. It has all that I need and more! I took a chance on a relatively new company and glad I did. One bit of advice when unpacking your TV&hellip;I opened it from the top, take out the thick brown protective cardboard, also the top styrofoam and accessory packet. Then I carefully laid it down on my carpet and sat on the floor and pulled/slid it out from the other side. My wife and I (after putting the stands on..laid a blanket over the box) picked it up by gripping the bottom but placing our hands open/flat on the top. The frame is very thin and must be moved carefully. We had no problems or damage to the box or the TV. Yes, there are probably better TV&rsquo;s out there but you will pay a premium price. We have an LG 65uh8500, Vizio M55-C2, Sony 60r550, TLC 55US5800, and this TV &ldquo;right up there&rdquo; with them in terms of picture quality. Thanks for reading!</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve attached photos of the TV, taken within seconds of each other. There is zero light bleed; it just looks like it on loading and menu screens</strong><strong>Update 2: TCL called and assured me the DirecTV Now app is coming at some point. DirecTV is in charge of the approval/timing, so we are waiting on them. Fair enough.</strong>I am fully editing my original 2-star review. In it, I complained about &ldquo;terrible light bleed.&rdquo; After actually watching content, I can say with 100% certainty that there is zero light bleed on my set.Yes, the menus with black backgrounds and some solid-black (empty) transition/loading screens will make the set look like it has crazy light bleed. This isn&rsquo;t the case. As another reviewer put it, the menus do not have &ldquo;local dimming&rdquo; so it looks like bleed.If you actually watch content, you will quickly find that the panel gets jet black. One example YouTube video to illustrate this is:&ldquo;LG HDR 4K Oled Demo&rdquo;Find that video and watch it (pause at 12:09). You will see exactly what I mean. There is probably nothing wrong with anyone&rsquo;s set&hellip;no light bleed in the corners, etc. So, avoid the knee-jerk negativity until you&rsquo;ve actually watched content. My take, anyway as I was 100% wrong in my initial critical review. FYI, this is the only LCD I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ve been able to replace my Pioneer Kuro Plasma with. It&rsquo;s that good. Not OLED good, but also not a fortune. It&rsquo;s a perfect replacement for the Kuro, the best TV I&rsquo;ve ever had that I didn&rsquo;t think was replaceable.I highly recommend this TV, especially for the money. Nothing else comes close, IMO.</p>
