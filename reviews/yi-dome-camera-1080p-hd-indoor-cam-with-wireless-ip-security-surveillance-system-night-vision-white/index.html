<h5 id="great-purchase-a-couple-complaints">Great Purchase - A Couple Complaints</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two of these YI Dome Cameras to watch my place and my cats while I&rsquo;m at work or out of town. They were easy to setup with my smart phone. The original power cord they provide is short. If you want to mount these to your ceiling you need to buy a longer usb power cable. Consider where you&rsquo;re plugging it in and where you want to mount it. It also does not come with a micro SD memory card. You will need one for each camera if you want it to save clips and have saved alerts from each.The cameras come with minimal directions, but there is plenty of information on their app/online to help you if you get stuck. All you do is plug it in, scan from the app on your phone to connect it to your wifi and you&rsquo;re hooked up. There are settings within the app you can update (alerts, recording, etc). You do the same steps adding additional cameras. I find the app mildly difficult to navigate - sometimes it takes me a few rounds to get to what I&rsquo;m looking for.The ad on the app isn&rsquo;t bad, it&rsquo;s a full size page that comes up when you open the app that you just press &lsquo;skip&rsquo; to get to your cameras. It happens like once a day. I almost didn&rsquo;t buy them because of the complaints about the ads, but I don&rsquo;t find it hard to press &lsquo;skip&rsquo; once a day. It might happen every time you completely close the app.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is, besides the short original power cord, the picture still seems pixelated to me even though I purchased 1080p. It looks ok zoomed out, but as I zoom in on what&rsquo;s happening on the camera from the app things do get distorted. I know that happens with fixed lenses (you&rsquo;re zooming in on the image, the camera isn&rsquo;t actually zooming in), but it seems a bit low-qual for my tastes. Also my place tends to be dark, which doesn&rsquo;t help. Good lighting and close to the camera things looks great! Night vision is handy, but can also pixilate. So, in short, I can definitely see what&rsquo;s going on, it just not fine quality imagery. Good natural light is best. So not terrible but not completely satisfying in my situation.The two way audio works well. I have no qualms with it.I can move the cameras remotely back and forth and up and down to check out an entire room. Also easy-to-use.They look nice, just as pictured.Altogether a worthy purchase for what I&rsquo;m using it for.</p>

<h5 id="unable-create-yi-home-account-and-glad">Unable create Yi Home account - and glad!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I hit a few stumbling blocks while trying to create a Yi Home account. First it wouldn&rsquo;t accept my password as it didn&rsquo;t meet Yi&rsquo;s format - yet nowhere in the app could I find their required password format. I Goggled &ldquo;Yi Home password format&rdquo; to get that it must be &ldquo;8 - 16 characters long, use at least three of the following types of characters, numbers[missing comma] uppercase characters, lowercase characters, or symbols&rdquo;. I changed my password to comply, but was never able to clear the final hurdle.They require validation of your email address, and state that you must click on their link emailed link &ldquo;within 30 minutes&rdquo; in order to finalize setting up your account. The link never arrived, neither in my inbox or Spam folder. I clicked &ldquo;re-send link&rdquo; - nothing. I tried from scratch to create the account - nothing. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app on my phone - still no validation came. I emailed Yi tech support and received a reply, a day later, saying I should try reentering my info.By the time I received that &ldquo;support&rdquo; the item was on its way back to Amazon.Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m happy with the outcome:While waiting for the validation email to arrive, I read the EULA in the app and realized that, had I kept it, I was giving them permission to access to my contacts list, my browser history, all my media, and the ability to let them install third party software to my phone. Wow! Privacy? You don&rsquo;t have no stinking privacy - at least not with this app!</p>

<h5 id="must-buy">Must buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to say this camera is even better than I expected. I have tried other monitors and the latency issue is significant. But this one has no latency at all! And the resolution is very high, I can see clearly from app. Would highly recommend this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-camera">Amazing camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really cool. Video quality is amazing, user interface is intuitive and doesn&rsquo;t crash. I am really happy with it. I purchased first Yi cam on Amazon Lightning sale and after playing with it I decided to get another one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="toc_7">👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it and plan to get two or three more to cover the rest of the house.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-ring-or-arlo">Better than Ring or arlo.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have both Ring and Arlo, but the YI camera is so much better than both of those and at a fraction of the price. Setup is a breeze but mostly I like the fact that it is on line instantly when I want to view.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-the-best-indoor-camera-i-haved-purchased">So far the best indoor camera I haved purchased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far the best indoor camera I haved purchased. I have tried about 5 different cameras and this one is the best. The app is great but the only thing I would add is a easier way to search for videos, like date and time to search for. Great that I can use a 128gb micro sd card with no problem. Also I have the choice to use the cloud service available.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yi-dome-camera-1080p-works-well">YI Dome Camera 1080p Works Well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased the YI Dome Camera 1080p. We have several of the other YI Home Cameras but bought this one for its ability to pan and tilt around so we could see multiple angles and views. The camera has worked great so far. The 1080p is definitely higher quality and resolution than the 720p which is to be expected. The base of the camera is a little bulky but nothing too obtrusive. We have this inside the home and waiting for YI to put out a similar outdoor version of this dome camera.</p>
