<h5 id="short-precise-review-excellent-beginner-s-bundle">Short &amp; Precise Review - [Excellent Beginner&rsquo;s Bundle]</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Included is my video review of this 50 accessories kit for Action Cameras.Watch to see me go through ALL the items and what they are.I am pretty impressed with this kit. Really worth it if you are trying to find some accessories but do not know which ones to buy and use.My FAVORITES and the two that I use most from this bundle are:- Octopus tripod. This is seriously the best portable tripod ever. Very flexible and blendy to put anywhere! It stands and it curves onto anything like a tree branch. Does not disappoint me at all.- The clip mount. Good to put on my backpack to get pretty solid views.For these accessories, I only used on my GoPro. But if the listing states your action camera, then it should work.Overall, I really enjoy this kit and the case as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-ok">Seems OK</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to be a pretty good variety of stuff but keep in mind if you do not have a go pro with that weird attachment on the bottom you will have to get an adapter to match with anything you&rsquo;re using. Everything was pretty much kind of just thrown into the case which is soft not hard plastic and not labeled at all so I had to refer back to pictures to figure out what was what and what went with each other as far as Long Jevity I don&rsquo;t know that hopefully it&rsquo;ll last and hold up it&rsquo;s all plastic. Bottom line is make sure you set some time to the side to figure out what goes with what before you plan on using it if you&rsquo;re in a hurry I would avoid this because it has to all be put together</p>

<h5 id="killer-deal-on-a-lot-of-really-useful-accessories">Killer deal on a LOT of really useful accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a #GoPro 4 Silver and a GoPro 2HD &amp; all these goodies fit both cameras very well. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this kit has everything I&rsquo;ll ever need for my cameras, including a case that has a foam insert with a cutout to fit the camera in. I especially like the wrist cuff thing that has the 360º swivel mount on it because, as we all know, life isn&rsquo;t all right angles. Sometimes you need to mount your camera at a weird angle &amp; this thing does it!The chesty rig is pretty snug on me, but I&rsquo;m a girl with&hellip;ahem&hellip;well, I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that. ;) The head mount is nice and has grippy stuff on the strap so it stays put. The selfie stick is stiff, so the camera doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;ll just twirl over. I like the helmet mount arm for fun selfie footage. The lens cover fits my GoPro 4 Silver perfectly, but only fits the cameras with the square lens housing (3 &amp; up). All the clips and mounts fit together snugly and securely &amp; I have no worries about them coming undone or causing shaky footage. I&rsquo;m always leery about mounting a $400-$500 camera on ANY suction cup, so I use a long, steel fishing leader as a safety tether just in case the suction fails for some reason. It hasn&rsquo;t happened, but better safe than sorry!I can&rsquo;t find any quality issues with any of the pieces and there are no shoddy molding marks or seams &amp; they don&rsquo;t feel brittle. The fabric pieces, like the straps and the case, are all nicely made and finished; no stray strings or fraying. The adhesive pads are 3M VHB, which stands for &ldquo;very high bond&rdquo;, so be sure you want to stick them wherever it is that you&rsquo;re sticking them!Overall, this is a killer deal on a LOT of really useful, easy to use accessories. I got a deal on this kit with a coupon code for evaluation, but It&rsquo;s totally worth the asking price and then some.</p>

<h5 id="terrific-action-camera-case-with-accessories">Terrific action camera case with accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this primarily for the travel case to provide protection for my &ldquo;faux-pro&rdquo; camera. I am impressed at the amount of accessories as well as their quality. My camera had come with many of the same smaller attachments however this set includes several that I did not have. Of note is the head harness, chest harness, float, and tripod. The tripod is of special note as it is the type with bendable legs. This allows use on uneven locations or even being able to wrap it around an object such as a limb. There is also a vehicle or dash mount a selfie stick (for those so inclined for such) and several other attachment devices. All in all, this 50 piece set is an amazing purchase if only for the case. The addition of so many items included more than makes this a fantastic purchase for anybody looking for a well constructed case with bonus items.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-products">Great products</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality for such an inexpensive product. Its worth this price for just 2 items let alone everything, so far i use the headstrap often and the tripod which is better than gopros crappy $20 one. Def worth the 20. Word to the wise if u have actual go pro buckles dont buckle them into these use the supplied buckles i.e. generic with generic and gopro with gopro, at least for the buckles, you will save yourself a headache.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-nice-variety-of-ways-to-use-the-camera">What a nice variety of ways to use the camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a nice variety of ways to use the camera. Everything in this kit can allow the camera to be used in any conceivable way. The parts are high quality and we used the headgear right way and the chest mount and it is a fabulous set. The only thing missing; we need to find a bag or case to keep all the little parts together as the case that comes with the Geekpro camera does not have enough room for the variety of accessories in this set as well as all the great stuff that comes with the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-let-the-low-price-fool-you-this-is-a-pretty-good-package">Don&rsquo;t let the low price fool you. This is a pretty good package.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These straps and adapters will get the job done. It&rsquo;s well worth what you pay, and then some. The buckles and attachment pieces all seem to be very well made. The case will not hold all of the attachments and the camera at the same time unless you do what I did. I just through the foam insert away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-package">great package!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Action Camera Accessories Kit has more adapters then I can ever need, the pouch can hold 2 action cameras and all the accessories I need for my next snorkeling trip to Hawaii. I am very impress that it has lots of mounts with sticky tape for dash mounts. great package!</p>
