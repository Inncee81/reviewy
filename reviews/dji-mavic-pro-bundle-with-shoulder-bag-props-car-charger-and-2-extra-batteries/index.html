Wherever You Go The DJI Mavic Pro is a small yet powerful drone that turns the sky into your creative canvass easily and without worry, helping you make every moment an aerial moment. Its compact size hides a high degree of complexity that makes it one of DJI’s most sophisticated flying cameras ever. 24 high-performance computing cores, an all-new transmission system with a 4.3mi (7Km) range, 4 vision sensors, and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal, are at your command with just a push of your thumb or a tap of your finger. POWERFUL Fly for miles. From your pocket. Inside the Mavic’s pocket-sized remote controller is DJI’s brand new OcuSync transmission technology, with a range of 4.3mi (7km) and Full HD 1080p video streaming. No bumps and scrapes When you know what’s in front of you, you won’t bump into it. The same is true of the Mavic. Using Flight Autonomy it can see obstacles as far away as 49ft (15m) in front, so that it can fly at up to 22mph (36kph) while avoiding the things it sees. Absolute Precision Flight Autonomy technology means the Mavic can hover precisely in more environments, and automatically land almost exactly where you took off. Stay flying longer Why fly for 10 or 15 minutes when you can fly for up to 27? With the Mavic you can. Use every single pixel The Mavic is the only drone of its size to carry an integrated high-precision 3-axis mechanical camera stabilization system, giving you crystal clear photos and smooth videos, without losing a single pixel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been flying drones for a while now, I have and have had a lot of drones from different manufacturers&hellip;and as far as DJI goes I&rsquo;ve had the Phantom 2, Phantom 3, Phantom 4 and now as of yesterday the Mavic Pro. I placed my pre-order with DJI on the very first day and waited patiently until it arrived at my door yesterday afternoon. Now the first thing I&rsquo;ll comment on is the size of the box it comes in&hellip;it&rsquo;s a lot smaller than I expected (I actually didn&rsquo;t think this was the Mavic when I first got the package)&hellip;but after opening the box, there it was in all its glory&hellip;the little wonder that is the Mavic Pro.I pulled the Mavic out of the box and immediately realized how little this thing is compared to my Phantoms, it&rsquo;s size is definitely going to be the draw for most people (it&rsquo;s small enough to fit in a shoulder camera bag making it WAY more portable and comfortable to tote around than my Phantom 4). The 4 arms are all folded up into the body making it about the size of a water bottle (slightly bigger) in its portable state. Once you unfold the arms (they only unfold one way, you won&rsquo;t break them) it ends up being almost as big around as my Phantoms (slightly smaller) but about half as tall. When you open the arms they kinda snap into place (they don&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;snap&rdquo; but they are solidly in their open positions without any worry of them accidentally closing during flight). Holding the opened Mavic in my hands it definitely doesn&rsquo;t have a cheap feel to it (it better not I just payed $1000 for this little guy). It&rsquo;s very well built and just feels rugged. The whole thing just oozes quality (I&rsquo;m not sure what the top portion and the arms are made of but the underneath belly portion is made of metal). It comes with the propellers off but putting them on is easy, and once they are on you don&rsquo;t have to take them off again (they fold into the body with the arms) which is AWESOME!The camera comes with a small gimbal lock on the back of it (make sure you remove this before flying) and a clear protective &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; of sorts which is easy to put on and take off (I believe it can be flown with the bubble on but I&rsquo;m sure there would be some kind of glare that would affect your videos and pictures, so I&rsquo;ll be flying with it off). The camera itself is fantastic really, easily comparable to the camera on the P4. It does have a narrower FOV but honestly the videos and pictures I took were just as good as the stuff I get with my Phantom 4 (this camera has a &ldquo;tap to focus&rdquo; feature which the Phantom does not have, you have to tap the screen to focus&hellip;so make sure you learn how to use that properly before trying to capture pictures or videos or you will end up with undesirable results. Another note on the camera&hellip;there is a manual zoom button on the controller (d5 button) that you press left or right to zoom the camera in or out). Also new is the &ldquo;tripod&rdquo; mode which you will absolutely LOVE!!! It essentially drops Mavic’s maximum speed to just 2.2 mph (3.6 km/h) and reduces the sensitivity of the control inputs, to allow for precision positioning which makes for better videos as well as to make it easier to fly indoors or in confined spaces. It&rsquo;s awesome and makes you look like a professional.Now&hellip;the controller this comes with is just a dream&hellip;it&rsquo;s just so little and portable (I&rsquo;m used the the big bulky controllers that came with my Phantoms). It has 2 fold out handles that open below the controller, when opened you can slide your cell phone up into the handles (there is a small cable that connects your phone to the controller, DJI was nice enough to include both cables (iOS and Android) in the box, so there is nothing more to buy). I think I prefer the screen below the controller like this as opposed to having it on top&hellip;definitely less glare (I was able to get my iPad mini 4 to fit and stay in the controller just fine, should work with all other ipad minis as well). The controller has a built in LCD screen which gives you all kinds of information including flight speed, distance, battery levels, altitude, GPS sattelites etc (just about everything you need to know), there are programmable buttons on the back of the remote as well as 2 wheels which are used to control the camera&rsquo;s position and settings during flight. (I&rsquo;m not gonna go into all the buttons and settings as they are well explained in the manual. The manual has everything you need to know and is very well written and easy to follow, I suggest you read through the entire thing and learn what everything does before you make your first flight).The battery goes right in the middle on the top of the Mavic, it easily snaps into place. It takes a little over an hour to fully charge the battery, and I got 20 minutes or so of flying time off the full charge. The battery charger has two built in USB ports which allow you to also charge your phone while you are charging your batteries and controller (cool idea).OK&hellip;so how does this puppy fly?? Well I would have to say EXCELLENT, in GPS mode this thing literally doesn&rsquo;t move, it is so solid and stable&hellip;even in any kind of wind (I think it handles better than my P4) and flying it is really just as easy as my Phantoms were. The front facing obstacle avoidance works as advertised (there is NO obstacle avoidance if you are flying sideways or backwards ONLY forward) and they definitely improved on the indoor flying stability because when I hovered inside it was as if I had full GPS lock (I had zero) which is very impressive. When they say they fly themselves they aren&rsquo;t kidding (If you&rsquo;ve flown Phantoms then you will feel right at home flying this little wonder&hellip;and if you&rsquo;ve never flown any kind of GPS drone then you will be absolutely amazed at how rock solid this thing is and how easy it is to fly).It has all kinds of different features including RTH (return to home), active track, gesture mode, tap to fly etc (I won&rsquo;t go into these because I think the manual will tell you everything you need to know probably better than I would explain it). I did test the gesture mode and it works as advertised, as does the active track and tap to fly. There&rsquo;s a WiFi mode which allows you to fly the Mavic with just your cell phone (not sure I&rsquo;ll use it but it&rsquo;s nice to have the option).The Mavic&rsquo;s size is where it&rsquo;s at for sure. I plan on getting the case that DJI sells for storage and for transport (its about the size of a camera bag and has room for the Mavic, controller and extra batteries). I can tell you with confidence that I will be using the Mavic almost all the time over my Phantom, simply because of it&rsquo;s size and the fact that it shoots videos and photos just as well as the Phantom does. Being able to grab a camera sized bag and throw it over my shoulder is so much easier and more convenient than grabbing my big ol Phantom backpack. The Mavic does everything the Phantom does and might even do it better&hellip;AND it&rsquo;s priced less. As of writing this the Mavic&rsquo;s are in short supply due to heavy demand (a lot of people still waiting on their pre-orders). I think once they become readily available you will see a LOT of Phantoms going up for sale. I absolutely LOVE this thing!! Way to go DJI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received mine today direct from DJI (not Amazon). This drone is amazing, even compared to the Phantom 4 (I&rsquo;ve had one for about 6 months now).Pros:- Incredibly stable, even indoors! You could cut someone&rsquo;s hair with this drone (don&rsquo;t do this).- Great video quality- Amazing range. Got to ~1 mile with a good number of trees in the way before video started to flake out, 2 miles over open water without any issues. Yet to do a full range test.- TINY! I can literally put this in my jacket pocket- Almost zero setup! You can stop and be flying in about a minuteCons:- Got a good amount of reflection off of the plastic camera guard/dome. I removed it for the 2nd flight- Preliminarily it seems to be slightly less agile than a Phantom 4, but that may be due to the fact that it was pretty windy today and the Mavic is half of the P4&rsquo;s weight.In general I strongly subscribe to the idea that &ldquo;the best camera is the one you have with you&rdquo;. Other drones may be more capable (and likely far more $$), but you can take this one everywhere.</p>

<p>Purchased this drone for my 40 year old Son for Christmas. I figured it would be ideal for him and his active family, and IT IS! So what if it took two months to arrive, when it did it was almost instantly in the air flown by a guy that has never flown a drone. They have had it over a month and ALL their family love flying it!This drone is NOT a toy. It is a very professional machine designed to offer even the new flyer HUGE and very usable features that are very easy to master.He used it recently to inspect the top of my fireplace chimney where we discovered large cracks that allowed water to accumulate inside my house. The film is so very sharp and super clear, and will allow the contractor to prepare quickly for the repairs needed.He has already used the drone to inspect many acres for possible locations to build his house. This drone is most certainly a very necessary tool and not simply a toy.All that witness it in flight first mention how quiet it is! And it truly is very quiet-almost scary quiet.He tried the sport mode and flew it at 62 MPH!!!!!!! by GPS. All of the features work so very well-object tracking, Terrain follow, return to home, object avoidance-EVERY feature works so very perfectly!I wish my dad was alive to see this amazing tech.</p>
