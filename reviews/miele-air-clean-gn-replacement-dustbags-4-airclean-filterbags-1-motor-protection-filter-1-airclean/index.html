<h5 id="wow-the-bag-looks-high-quality">Wow, the bag looks high quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>8/19/2010Bought mine from seller &ldquo;Mr.Vac &amp; Mrs.Sew&rdquo; (about the 5th time now as of 6/3/2012), came as advertised and on time.$19 for a box of 4 bags and 2 filters, which average out to $4.75 per bag. I was considering the third party bags at about $2.6 per bag, but read that they are thinner and made in China instead of Germany. The law of nature is that most times, you get what you pay for. Got the Miele Capri vacuum, the bag that came installed, same as these bags, WOW, looks like an expensive pillow.12/7/2010 (UPDATE)I&rsquo;m still using the original bag that came with the vacuum and the bag changing gauge on the vacuum is still not telling me to change it yet. It&rsquo;s either the bag is soooo large, or I&rsquo;m just a clean person where there&rsquo;s not much dirt to pick up :^) Looks like one box of 4 bags may last over a year, going by the way I use the vacuum.12/19/2010 (UPDATE)Maybe I don&rsquo;t have a sense of smell anymore, but my father&rsquo;s dog like nose smelled dust the first time he used the vacuum. So I stuck my nose right up against the ventilation of he vacuum, and did noticed the dust smell, so I changed the bag for the first time, and it was pretty damn full. However, I never noticed the bag changing gauge in the vacuum move much at all.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-great-bags">These are great bags.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great bags. I use them with my Miele S8390 FreshAir Canister Vacuum and they work great. They are large bags that hold a lot of dust and pet hair, of which we have plenty. I am allergic to dust mites so these bags are great for me. Yes, they are bit more expensive then the regular bags but they last quite a bit longer and to me they are worth the price.There are 4 bags in the box, plus a motor protection filter and an AirClean filter. They are easy to put on and easy to remove. I will be sticking with these bags over the regular bags despite the higher cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-a-miele-believer">I am a Miele Believer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW, do this little bags hold a lot of dirt! I just bought a new Miele in October. I vacuum once a week in a 2500sq ft home with two cats and a husband. I just got concerned that my &ldquo;bag full&rdquo; indicator was not working so decided to change the bag and filter. Guess what, there was still room in this little bag&hellip;&hellip;..unbelieveable! Five Months and still had room for at lease an other month. So I am not going to listen to all of the people complaining about how expensive these bags are. In my mind they are worth every dime. No more old paper bags that never really filled all the way or dumping out the dirt with bagless vacuums three or four times on cleaning day. These are made of a fabric type material and work fabulously. Thank You Miele, the bags and vacuum and well made and WORK!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="expensive-but-long-lasting-a-good-value-in-the-long-run">Expensive, but long lasting. A good value in the long run.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re a lot more expensive than the paper bags used by most vacuum cleaners, but they seem to pack a lot more dust and dirt before the airflow slows down. I&rsquo;ve been using my Miele canister vacuum for a solid two weeks and haven&rsquo;t seen any loss of suction, and other reviewers here say that they get as much as six months from a bag. The bags are constructed of a non-woven fabric that&rsquo;s thicker than paper bags and seems to have more possible paths for the air to follow, so even when it&rsquo;s nearly full, plenty of air can flow and carry dust in. However it works, it does hold a lot more dirt than other bags. When you consider that a box of four bags comes with a pair of disposable filters as well, it starts to look like an even better deal. At any rate, I&rsquo;m sold on the Miele and these bags.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-dustbag">What a Dustbag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you review a vacuum cleaner dustbag, of all things? I give the Miele bags 5 stars. Does that mean, as Amazon describes the star system, that I &ldquo;love&rdquo; them!!!??? Well, no. It&rsquo;s a dustbag. But like virtually all Miele products, these are excellent &hellip; dustbags. Seriously, they are made of high-quality materials that leave no residue from micro-fine dust leakage inside the vac. They seal perfectly. They don&rsquo;t clog, even when very full, such that your vacuum sounds like it&rsquo;s trying to consume your entire carpet. And finally, they don&rsquo;t create a mess when you take them out of your vac and toss them.Highly recommended, considering they are the only game in town for Miele vacs &hellip; (make sure you get the right ones!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-love-to-save-money-with-the-miele-like-bags">Would love to save money with the Miele &ldquo;like&rdquo; bags</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality product. Would love to save money with the Miele &ldquo;like&rdquo; bags, but so many reviews stated they don&rsquo;t work as well and might affect the future performance of my (terribly expensive) vacuum, decided it&rsquo;s not worth the few extra dollars. So either Miele truly makes a quality bag specific for their high performance vacuum, or they&rsquo;ve invested their marketing dollars incredibly wisely, ensuring their revenue stream has no competition! Either way, my house is clean and with 3 dogs and 3 kids with allergies, the sniffles are, if you&rsquo;ll excuse the pun, nothing to sneeze about! Ha</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-pay-for-what-you-get">You pay for what you get&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there so much bickering on here about the price? You bought a Miele and you were surprised that the OEM accessories aren&rsquo;t as cheap as generic? Ultimately these bags function perfectly. If you want a cheaper item you have the option of buying 3rd party bags: it&rsquo;s that easy. These are less than $5/bag currently, and if saving $5 is your kind of thing, you know your options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-miele-no-hepa-cartridge">Not Miele; no HEPA cartridge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What arrived was exactly as described; however, I wish I had read the description&ndash;and examined the picture of the box (which the product did NOT arrive in) shown on the advertisement more carefully. These are not Miele bags. They will probably work with the vacuum; but they are not the Miele bags. They do come with the membrane filter that the real Miele bags come with; but they do NOT come with the HEPA cartridge filter that Miele includes with their bags.(This is why they are so economical, I suppose.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hoping-they-are-real-miele">Hoping they are real Miele</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent price, came weeks sooner than I expected, BUT it was not in manufacturer boxes as pictured/described so I hope items are the real manufacturer (seems to be)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-fast-shipping-overseas-will-use-again">Very fast shipping overseas, will use again!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very fast shipping overseas, packed in bulk to fit a smaller package, highly likely I will order again!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
