<h5 id="take-a-chance-on-dudema-nothing-to-lose-quality-materials-stylish-comfortable-customer-service">Take A Chance On Dudema; Nothing to Lose; Quality Materials, Stylish; Comfortable; Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My son just turned 16 on March 16th last month, and is constantly wanting new sunglasses. Of course, teenagers want the big brands that parents would be crazy to pay! I tried several brands but they either do not fit right, lenses pop out, can&rsquo;t see out of them or they aren&rsquo;t really polarized. I settled on these after seeing a friend&rsquo;s pair.Packaging: They arrived quickly in a secure box. They come with a very nice protective zip up case that protects them, a quality card from Dudema with all the needed customer service/warranty info (thanks Dudema, would have lost it), a microfiber cleaning cloth and a drawstring bag. Even more brownie points for Mom! All of this make them a great gift.Fit: (I tried them on myself. Probably not for most women, but could be! They are comfy, and they do not leave those ugly nose marks when you take them off. They do not leave marks on the side of the face either.)Vision: The polarized lenses are excellent (work really well here in hot &amp; sunny Louisiana!). Great for driving, work, jogging, hiking or just outdoors. Pushed up on top of the head, they grip very well.Sturdiness: My son is rough on shades, he has broken at least 2 pair of Oakleys since last Christmas. He has dropped these down a flight of stairs and he has put them down on his old 3- wheeler, popped a wheelie, and knocked them to the ground. Did not break and not a scratch yet. Cleaning: They will show fingerprints, like most lenses, but clean quickly and easily with the cloth or even a T-shirt.Cons: A little light feeling in the hand, but actually made for a better fit. Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything we didn&rsquo;t like. (Other than my son and his Dad arguing over them!)I will be purchasing more in different styles. I&rsquo;m glad we took a chance on Dudema! No more ridiculous prices for a stylish pair of shades.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-those-who-are-active-and-want-quality-at-a-low-price">Great for those who are active and want quality at a low price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These glasses are just too cool! I was very impressed with the quality and the clarity of these sunglasses. They are a light weight 8 oz, but don&rsquo;t feel cheap in any way. My son has been using them since yesterday and he&rsquo;s pretty hard on things and they are holding up!The design is very modern and, as I said, the clarity is great with not warping as you might expect from an inexpensive sun glass. The wrap around style also is great for active movement as they don&rsquo;t easily slip and the comfortable nose guards don&rsquo;t dig in where other glasses&rsquo; nose guards do.They come with a very impressive specialized case, a no-scratch pocket case, a cleaning cloth and the warranty is a lifetime warranty! Amazing for a sun glass company!Get these for yourself or for your son/daughter. They are worth the little extra.</p>

<h5 id="update-improved-quality-and-sent-replacement-thanks-original-title-liked-it-until-it-broke-six-weeks-in">UPDATE: Improved quality and sent replacement - THANKS (ORIGINAL Title: Liked it until it broke six weeks in.)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: Indeed, the first one broke and the lens started peeling off (see below). Then, when looking for replacement glasses, I saw several that Duduma, based on customer feedback, had improved both of the issues. I also saw that they would offer a replacement. After emailing them and sending pictures of my damaged one, indeed, the promptly sent me a replacement. They are working much better and do appear to be improved. Can&rsquo;t ask for much better service than recognizing a fault in their product, fixing it and offering a replacement. Thanks for the commitment to improvement and customer service(original review:)Unfortunately, after six weeks, the little plastic piece that connects the end of one earpiece to the rest of the sunglasses broke. I had hoped for something decent quality for a decent price; might need to upgrade next time. Also, it is hard to see my iPhone screen for some reason, possibly due to the polarization?</p>

<h5 id="real-buyer-good-for-bigger-heads-or-wider-faces">Real Buyer - good for bigger heads or wider faces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these in November 2015 and they lasted until July 2016 pretty well, and I wore them EVERY day. Until someone sat on them. So they aren&rsquo;t unbreakable but they&rsquo;re pretty dang good for the money.If it says anything, I bought them again. The first time I got the white and blue ones (The white ear part does get a little discolored, but not bad) and this time I got the grey ones.Better for wider faces or bigger heads - I wear a 7 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch fitted hat and find it hard sometimes to get singlasses to fit my face&hellip; These are perfect. I see a lot of pics on the reviews here that make them look like they are too big for some people&rsquo;s heads.</p>

<h5 id="does-not-fog-when-running-lifetime-guarantee-on-frames-stylish-modern-what-more-can-a-gal-ask-for">Does not fog when running. Lifetime guarantee on frames. Stylish, Modern. What more can a gal ask for.?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>`Not very often you can find a great pair of sunglasses at an affordable price. Based on the reviews here I took a chance and may I say I was not disappointed. I bought these for my husband who is a jogger. He told me that they do not fog up while running,,, a complaint you get witth sunglassses and runners. The frame seems strong enough maybe that is why they have a lifetime warranty. While the sunglasses is durable it is also very stylish and modern. Even my sons love these glasses. I bought the black for my husband and he looks very handsome in them. For the price and durability, I am happy to give this a full five-star rating. If any changes I always come back and update mt review</p>
