<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="decent-monitor-a-bit-flimsy-unstable-terrible-controls">Decent monitor, a bit flimsy/unstable, terrible controls</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works, and looks nice, though I haven&rsquo;t compared the image quality side by side to other monitors. Surprisingly lightweight, though the base seems a bit flimsy, which may be an issue if subject to frequent motion or vibration (e.g. in an RV or boat). Since the base is light and relatively small for such a large screen, the monitor could be easily knocked over if you live with cats or klutzes, so you may want to place it defensively against a wall.At its brightest setting, the screen is extremely bright (painfully so for dungeon dwellers), and can be adjusted in 1% increments to make it very dim.The controls are downright convoluted. The five buttons on the frame&rsquo;s lower right underside let you navigate a menu of settings, which can be saved in five preset groups of settings. This allows you to switch between a group of settings you prefer for word processing vs. gaming. But the settings user interface is so non-intuitive that it&rsquo;s quite confusing to figure out. Simply changing the screen brightness to compensate for your room&rsquo;s current brightness is needlessly time consuming, and even frustrating until you figure it out. Since brightness is such a basic setting, it would have been better accomplished with a brightness knob. Or to save a few cents on manufacturing, with separate &ldquo;brighter&rdquo; and &ldquo;dimmer&rdquo; buttons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DAMN IT. STOP!!!!!!!!!!look. if you don&rsquo;t have this mounted or have an incredibly sturdy desk you are going to become ENRAGED with how much this monitor wobbles. if you have one of those right angle glass desks, forget it man. it&rsquo;s annoying as hell. even moving my mouse around causes this the monitor to shake uncontrollably. it&rsquo;s quivering at my inevitable rage when i drop kick it out the window at the neighbors dog that just won&rsquo;t stop barking. it&rsquo;ll happen someday. until then&hellip;.this monitor is disgustingly bright. i feel like i do when i&rsquo;m about to go to bed and i pull out my phone and it&rsquo;s on the highest brightness setting and it blinds me. even on the lowest settings it is still way too dang bright. even with flux installed it&rsquo;s too much.numerous times the buttons on the monitor have stopped working and i had to unplug the monitor completely and plug it back in to get them working again.look, for a budget monitor it&rsquo;s pretty good. the colors are good and it&rsquo;s just a great budget monitor. you get what you pay for. but the small things are the worst part about it. i could see this being a decent 4.5 star monitor if you mount it or something but if you are going with the stand forget it, it will drive you nuts.</p>

<h5 id="needs-a-better-stand">needs a better stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this for about 5 months now. I use it for shopping, email, Photoshop, spreadsheets, etc. but since I&rsquo;m not a game player, I don&rsquo;t use it for games. It&rsquo;s a perfectly fine monitor for the kinds of things I do with it, but I don&rsquo;t like the stand at all. It&rsquo;s plastic and it&rsquo;s flimsy and it reacts to everything that happens around it, such as banging on my desktop. If I had to do it all over again, I&rsquo;d probably choose a sturdier monitor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing-picture-and-video-quality">Disappointing picture and video quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two of these monitors, and for each of them, there is very noticeable noise and/or grain. One of my uses is editing videos, and as a result, a no-compression 1080p video, appears low quality and compressed. I have been forced to move the videos to other devices to see their &lsquo;true&rsquo; quality.Many of the monitor settings are &lsquo;locked&rsquo; depending on what &lsquo;mode&rsquo; you put the monitor into. There does not appear to be a &lsquo;mode&rsquo; in which you can just adjust all the settings as you please. I did however use suggested settings found on a Tech review of this monitor online.Finally, there is a very noticeable &lsquo;ghosting&rsquo; on the screen when scrolling a page up or down. In games and/or videos, it is not really very noticeable, but this &lsquo;ghosting&rsquo; can be easily reproduced by simply scrolling up or down on a webpage.That being said, when there is not much movement, or dark area on the screen, it is very sharp and crisp.Would not repurchase, and would not recommend.</p>

<h5 id="white-trails-of-shame">White Trails of Shame</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the Asus VS238H-P to match an identical model from several years ago. When I set it up with the same HDMI feed, the colors didn&rsquo;t match at all. I&rsquo;m a color TV broadcast engineer by trade, and I used to repair the old CRT TV monitors. I know what they&rsquo;re supposed to look like. Undeterred, I got them close enough and went about my work. It didn&rsquo;t take but a minute to notice the white trails behind every movement of black text or graphics, as if the refresh rate was not the advertised 2mS, but about 200mS. It looked like some of the lousy monitor/graphics card combos of the early 1990s. I thought I might ignore the defect, but I just couldn&rsquo;t. Yes, this monitor had a black handle on the box. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk getting another by asking for a direct replacement. Fortunately, Amazon took it back for a full refund. I went out and bought the slightly newer VX238H-P with a white handle on its box and got perfectly matching color and no trails of shame.</p>

<h5 id="kids-spatter">Kids spatter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife was a colour mixer for a photo lab before she retired.She says the values on this screen are very good.It was a snap to set up right out of the box.I installed it on a chromebox Moo4U with a standard HDMI cable.No worries.We have used it extensively for 2 months with no hasstles. My God its big compared to the 12 inch screens we have always used on laptops.Its easy to wipe off if you get it dusty or spotted with kids spatter.Its fairly robust,has a large metal pedestal which like the bezel is sealed in black plastic material, sturdy.This item has a rebate which is outta this world bad.My experience with rebates until this one has been: you punch in a code and out comes the rebate,either off the invoice right there, or worst case a check in the mail.Here they force you go through a series of hoops on line that would make a Philidelphia lawyer blush, and the payoff rebate is a credit on a limited credit card with all kinds of restrictions.Its too bad because its a good little item and they just need to sell the damn thing up front!</p>

<h5 id="pink-line-through-screen">Pink line through screen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the item in November of 2016. It now has a pink line going across the screen less than a year after purchase. I have tried multiple cords.</p>

<h5 id="not-for-win10-use-okay-for-others">Not for Win10 use, okay for others</h5>

<p>I was expecting a better picture based on my experience with the similar Hannspree products. However, I can find no fault with the workmanship and functionality.</p>

<p>Good Colors</p>

<h5 id="kind-of-meh">Kind of meh.</h5>
