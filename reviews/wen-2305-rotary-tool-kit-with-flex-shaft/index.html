<h5 id="great-deal">Great Deal.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great value.Experience: I have grouted 3 bathrooms and trimmed dog nails with this unit.Pros:This is a solid unit that I think will last a long time.It is well ventilated and did not over heat. Some chunks of grout got in the motor but the motor just ground them up and spit them out.Accepts drimel brand screw on attachments.Flex tool runs smooth and quiet.Main unit is not any louder than any other tool of its kind.Variable speed dial!!!Cons:The cutting tools and sander accessories are not great and you will find yourself buying new ones. I had to cut some toilet bolts but kept breaking cutting wheels and had to slow down and take more time than I thought necessary.Ventilation could use some mesh screening. Some chunks of grout got in the motor but the motor just ground them up and spit them out.Buy the flex tool, it is well worth it for getting into tight spaces and especially for dog grooming. With main motor on the floor and using the flex tool my dogs where much calmer about the process of trimming their nails down.</p>

<h5 id="2-sizes-of-collets-for-this-tool-dremel-has-4">2 Sizes of Collets For This Tool! (Dremel has 4)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I initially bought this, January 2015, from Amazon I was very happy with it and its original accessories. The unit itself is fine, but over time I did have problems with the collet that other reviewers mentioned. I have bought different brands of accessories from different sources, not knowing about the collet size issues. That is probably giving me fit, wobble problems with some accessories. This is what I dug into the online info and made a few assumptions:The collets are the brass metal pieces that the mandrels (2 are included) fit into, the accessory fits onto the end of a mandrel. According to WEN (wenproducts.com/store/101-Piece-Rotary-Tool-Kit-2307) this unit includes two sizes (1/8” collet &amp; 3/32” collet).WEN 1/8” collet = Collet-B Item: 2307-002-1WEN 3/32” collet = Collet-S Item: 2307-002-2Dremel has four sizes of collets 1/8”, 3/32”, 1/16” &amp; 1/32” the first two listed are the same size as the WEN&rsquo;s, the next two are smaller diameters. That is probably the source of my problems.When I use accessories, other than WEN, there may be diameter compatibility issues. At least, that is what I think I am experiencing.According to step 7 of the instructions, “This tool is supplied with a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; collet (fitted already on the tool) and a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; spare collet. Always select the correct size of collet.” How you are supposed to know that correct size is not described; probably because there is a gap that it cannot tighten upon?I hope this helps someone. I searched reviews for this and was unable to find any answers, so this is what I found and concluded. Good luck with your tools and projects.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-for-the-price">Very good for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had dremels in the past, but over time the motors in them failed. I thought about buying another corded dremel, but the price is 4-10 times the price of this tool. The battery models do not have very good speed control, so I prefer corded as it provides more power. This is the type of tool every home should have. I use it for so many various things.. fixing consumer products, repairing the house, engraving, creating artwork&hellip; You never realize how many things you can and will use it for. Not having one is quite painful, just like a screwdriver. This would make a perfect gift for teens+. It is fairly safe at low speeds, and the flex shaft adds to safety as it is easier to work with (and less intimidating). If you can use a drill, hot glue gun, or soldering iron without hurting yourself or damaging equipment, this tool should work out well.The quality of this product is fair. It looks and feels much like a dremel. I think it may operate a bit louder. The flex shaft is a good feature, and goes on easily. Obviously, when using the flex shaft, there is some resistance which decreases output. However, the mobility and dexterity gained makes it an invaluable tool for doing detail work (like shaping plastics, or creating artwork). This happens with dremels as well, though the flex shaft alone for them costs nearly twice what this entire set costs. The manual says to use the shaft it may be necessary to pull the inner wire out with pliers, but this could be bad advice. As long as the shaft is straight, it should come out quite easily, thought you might have to give it a small twist to loosen it up. Removing the inner rod and applying some teflon silicone lubricant will greatly enhance the operation of the flex shaft.The assortment of tools is quite good, and should last a while for casual users. The only thing that is not great is the case, which is fairly flimsy. Unlike dremel cases that have a backing card to fit each tool into, here they are simply thrown into a clear plastic box. Anyhow, the case gets the job done, and is fairly compact. It&rsquo;s a bit larger than my old dremel case, but then again, it also stores the flex shaft.The cutting wheels are different sizes than the ones I&rsquo;m used to from my old tool, but that&rsquo;s OK. A lot of the tools are slightly different than ones made by Dremel, but they&rsquo;re all interchangeable anyways. These seem to be more similar to the old Dremel bits with how the wheels and belts attach than the new ones, but no complaints here. I had a slight bit of trouble with the sanding wheels, as they do not fit snugly to the base. Wrapping some electrical tape around the base resolved this issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My vary speed Dremel stopped working after 20 yrs and it was time to get a new one. I took a chance on this because of the included flex shaft and the silly low price. After I ordered I decided to pull my Dremel out of the garbage and just see if I could fix it. I did. Now I have two rotary tools, so which one do I use? The Wen. It is much quieter and I love the flex shaft, in fact I keep it on at all times. Time will tell if it holds up like the Dremel.EDIT: I&rsquo;ve noticed some reviews stating the lack of instructions&hellip;really? It spins, you put attachments on it, what more instructions could you possibly need?</p>

<h5 id="no-flex-shaft-no-case">No Flex Shaft = No Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this thing is great. I&rsquo;ve never owned a rotary tool before so have no real basis for comparison. As a first time user, it was easy to set up, and easy to use. It is a pretty versatile tool and is compatible with Dremel accessories. The one thing I wish I would have paid more attention to is the difference in ordering with or without the flex shaft. In addition to the flex shaft, the higher price also buys a case for this tool, which would be helpful.No Flex Shaft = No Case</p>

<h5 id="not-good">NOT GOOD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just used this for the first time and it does not keep a constant speed. It speeds up and down making it hard to use for much of anything.</p>

<h5 id="good-tool">Good tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tool comes with a lot for the price and works Really good. I recommend this to anyone who does gunsmithing</p>

<h5 id="great">Great!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does what it says. Awesome price for what you are getting. Although some of the sanders were broken and one of the polishing disks were broken.</p>

<h5 id="yes-the-flex-shaft-is-compatible-with-dremel">Yes, the flex-shaft is compatible with Dremel</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I bought this for the flex shaft to use on my cordless Dremel. The flex-shaft works perfectly.</p>
