<h5 id="what-a-big-horrible-disappointment-so-much-potential-too">What a big horrible disappointment!!!! So much potential too. :(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, I am really upset to have to write this review. I bought this because I have to leave my kids along in the morning on occasion for school and wanted to be able to keep an eye on them in the 30 to 45 min time frame between when I leave and they get picked up to go to school. I ordered 3 cameras, and one of them arrived defective! I had to fight them to not have to pay the shipping cost to return their defective camera. AND the process took 3 weeks involving them not following up, sending emails asking for information I had already given by phone 2 days earlier, and getting their customer service representatives CONTACTING ME AT 3AM and not even apologizing!!!!! The system has a HUGE delay in recording for motion detection often completely missing the activity. The audio is so sensitive that my front camera records the passing cars so i end up with like 80 recordings draining my space and battery. Their &ldquo;geofencing&rdquo; stopped working when I added the3rd camera once it finally arrived almost a month later. It kept recording even when I was home, sending me like 30 email alerts saying motion detected, BUT I HAVE NOTIFICATIONS TURNED OFF, SO WHY AM I GETTING ALERTS!?!? When you select the type of mode you want the system to work in (Armed, disarmed, schedule, or geofencing, or create your own), you have to do it for ALL cameras. So even if I want the outside cameras on at night, but not the indoor cameras on, it&rsquo;s all or nothing. You can&rsquo;t individually select each camera&rsquo;s mode. I also wanted to turn the audio off for the front door camera to not get every loud car driving by, but the only audio you can turn off is the speaker audio or ability to hear. the camera still DETECTS the audio even with audio set to off, so, what&rsquo;s the point?? The system is so faulty I really wish I had not spent so much money on it. If they could fix all those problems, it could potentially be a great system. The picture quality is good and the speaker and alarm feature are also great, hence the added star (instead of giving 1 star). Please Arlo, fix all your glitches and you will do great. As of now I will be contacting you to trouble shoot these issues. If they can&rsquo;t be fixed, you can have your cameras back, I will need to get something I can really on.</p>

<p>I am mostly happy with the Arlo Pro system but it took some time getting it to work right. I bought the Arlo because of the completely wireless solution. I received the system on 12/1/17. I synced two of the three cameras with no issues. The third camera took many attempts to sync. I finally got it to sync (plugged into the wall) and then placed it in the back yard. For the next two days, that camera constantly went off line and would not connect. I took down the camera tried re-syncing it (several times again) and moved it closer to the base station at the front door with a full wifi signal compared to the ¾ signal I had in the backyard. The same thing kept happening with it dropping off line.I called NetGear and talked to tech support who agreed after trying to troubleshoot it that I had a bad camera. They sent me an RMA#. NetGear’s RMA policy is garbage as they make you pay for return postage on the return. It should be free for the first 30 days…After receiving the RMA email, I paid and initiated the RMA online. The next day, I looked closer at the RMA after I prepaid for advance shipping of the camera and noticed that the RMA was for base station and not a camera. After calling NetGear that night and speaking to the rep and being put on hold several times, one time for over 15 minutes, I finally got a new RMA # for a camera to replace the problematic one on <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>. I spent about an hour on the phone trying to cancel the RMA for the base station and getting one for the camera. Tech support is in India and there are some language issues which caused this mix-up.The new camera arrived on <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub>. It synced perfectly and so far, it is working as the other two are with no problems to report.I think the problem with the bad camera was in manufacturing. The battery does not seem to be tight enough in the camera. When I shook the camera, you could feel the battery move a lot more than with the replacement camera.</p>

<h5 id="no-support-poor-video">No Support, poor video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera&rsquo;s work and setup is easy but that&rsquo;s it. Resolution is poor unless bright light and less than20 feet. Dim light can not tell who it is if a stranger. A license plate? Forget it. Contacted customer support to change my credit card number. CSR did not know. After a hour of getting sent here and there to wrong departments and such I hung up. I also wanted to know how to access my pictures in the cloud but now know better than ask. Save your $9.95 and get a memory stick here at Amazon. I cannot find a place to access my personal account but can get community question blog, that&rsquo;s it. Wanted to find out when and if I could get 1080P in two add on camera&rsquo;s in pro. No plans to do so from their forum. Gave a bunch of nonsense as to why not. Must think everyone is computer illiterate. Funny everyone else can do it. Can not recommend Arlo Pro till 1080P and more server space. Received a reply to this. They never answere any of my comments but gave answered questions to ones I didn&rsquo;t ask. Obvious they did not take the time to read this or did not want to answere my concerns. Not good support as I stated. They do have a 1080p, Arlo Pro 2 but way too expensive now. Did not even state that in their reply. Should notify customer support it is out.</p>
