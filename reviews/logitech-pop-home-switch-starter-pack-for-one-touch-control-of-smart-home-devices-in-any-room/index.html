<h5 id="excellent-addition-for-your-smart-home">Excellent addition for your smart home</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is an exceptional addition to the smart home.I was so excited to get the POP based on what I read it could do. We have a full array of Sonos devices in our house as well as August locks and Lutron Caseta lights. We also use the excellent Logitech Hubs for our remote controls.I purchased a starter kit and 2 additional pops. Here is how I am using them.Kitchen - POP button 1:1. Play/Pause Sonos with Apple Music2. Play/Pause Sonos with Spotify Top Hits3. Play/Pause Sonos with NPRKitchen - POP button 2:1. Turn off Sonos, and Turn on TV2. Unused3. Turn off TVBedroom - POP button:1. Play/Pause Sonos with NPR2. Play/Pause Sonos with Spotify Top Hits3. Turn off Sonos and Bedroom LightsSetupSuper easy. Plug in hub, set up app, and add POP devices.In the app you discover all your local devices (Sonos) and then cloud authorize Harmony, Lutron and August.Each POP comes with that cool double sticky stuff that is removable and re-usable.ProgrammingYou just drags and drop, chose options for each device (such as toggle or on/off) and you can also add multiple devices per commandEach button has 3 commands (single click, double click, long press)ShortcomingsSonos - updated on <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> - fixedYou cannot group speakers together. No sonos interface can do this except Sonos for some reason. Also, if you make changes to your Sonos playlists (which is how you select items to play) it doesn&rsquo;t seem to refresh without re-discovering.You can&rsquo;t easily control volume.You can&rsquo;t skip songs.Harmony - updated on <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> - fixedIf you have two Harmony hubs in your house (for 2 TVs) you have to pick one to use. You cannot seemingly pair two different buttons to different Hubs. It&rsquo;s one hub per account.Update: the latest POP update supports Sonos Grouping and multiple harmony hubs. Great job Logitech!</p>

<h5 id="great-design-great-integration-with-harmony-hubs">Great design, great integration with Harmony Hubs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I debated between these vs the Philips Hue Dimmer Switches, but settled on these for the increase compatibility with other smart devices (namely the Harmony hub). The only downside I see is the lack of a dimmer built in, but after living with Hue lights for a few years now- I&rsquo;ve found I rarely am wanting to manually dim any lights.Setup: We have Hue lights in each nightstand lamp and throughout the house. I have a Pop switch on each nightstand and one at the door.Each nightstand switch is configured as such:1 tap: toggle the nightstand light on and offdouble tap: toggle the TV on and off (via a harmony hub)long press: toggles the entire house to a dim red color for an entire-house nighlightBeing able to do all of this from a button rather than messing around with a phone at night is a huge bonus- especially with a newborn baby that needs to be fed often (being able to long press for the red nightlights is awesome). The double tap to turn the TV on/off is a bonus for my wife who often comes to bed later than me and doesn&rsquo;t have to then search for the remote to turn the TV off if I had fallen asleep.It&rsquo;s been rock solid so far- no networking issues at all. Also very impressed with the look and feel of the buttons- feels very high quality and has a great minimalist look. I was so pleased with these that I just ordered a third switch to place near the entry door to easily turn on and off all the lights as we leave/enter.Great product.</p>

<h5 id="coverage-issues-works-well-with-smartthings-hub">Coverage issues. Works well with smartthings hub.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use it with smartthings and zwave switches and it works well.Main problem is coverage area of the bridge. If your button is close to bridge it registers every click immediately. If button is farther away (e.g. lower level) you need multiple clicks till one registers. The experience is inconsistent so that is disappointing.According to Logitech web site specs the bridge range is 50ft, and you can add more bridges for larger coverage but as of now there us no way to buy these.Edit 2/28/2017I have been using this for new months now. Logitech updated the app and added toggle options, however the bridge became unstable and need power cycle every few days. What I did to workaround it is to connect the bridge to power through a 25$ wifi plugin outlet adapter that I programmed to power cycle every night. With this and using buttons only near the bridge I have stable setup, ymmv and I still view this as 3 stars considering the limitations and workarounds.On the positive side the button works reliably for months in my steam shower, which is very nice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reliable-fast-easy-to-set-up">Reliable, fast, easy to set up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Switches work perfectly. Rapid response time, no missed clicks, integrates easily and quickly with all my other connected devices including LIFX bulbs, WeMo insight switches, harmony hub, sonos speakers, and IFTTT. Very happy with the purchase and I&rsquo;m ordering more now.I previously tried the flic switches which were unreliable, slow, and required a Bluetooth connection to a phone running the flic app. The pop switches communicate via a small hub which plugs into a power socket which I&rsquo;m guessing is why they are so much more reliable.Maybe now my girlfriend will appreciate our smart home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-set-up-pleasure-to-use">Easy to set up, pleasure to use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use smart home appliances and equipment, all consumer facing. Its a hobby of mine. I got pop to make it easier for my SO to control the lights in the apartment without adjusting the switches or opening an app in her phone. The Pop was incredibly easy to set up, and allowed me to essentially set up my independent lights into defacto zones - which is convenient for me as well. I have the Pop controlling several lights, which are a combo of GE Link bulbs and Lifx Bulbs.Pop was easy to connect to my smart hub and to the bulbs individually.I&rsquo;ll probably buy additional pop buttons to place around my home to add more &ldquo;granular&rdquo; support as I expand my &ldquo;smart home&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="love-them-need-more">Love them. Need more!</h5>

<p>Integrates my Belkin Wemo Devices with my Harmony hub, allowing my guest simple access to my smart homes different setting combinations. Incredibly simple to set up.</p>

<p>once set up these are great, easy to use and very helpful if you have non tech people in the house that need to control your lights, ect&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-fully-work-with-homekit">Doesn&rsquo;t fully work with Homekit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really want to like this product, but it fails big time in the Homekit department. Getting the bridge itself set up with Homekit is a breeze. Buttons are another story.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are perfect. Easy to set up and an essential buy for easy control of our LIFX lights. I have recommended them to many people who also love the convenience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-the-idea-and-really-hoped-that-it-would-work">I love the idea and really hoped that it would work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the idea and really hoped that it would work. The biggest problem is that it&rsquo;s so very inconsistent which is frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-idea-still-not-quite-ready-for-prime-time">Great idea&hellip; still not quite ready for prime time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When it works - awesome. Finally I can turn LIFX lights on / off and trigger Harmony activities - without fiddling with my phone etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-it">Get it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great, at first I tough I only got 1 button but that was because they are so slim I didn&rsquo;t notice when I first open the pack.Works great with ifttt</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-working-with-lifx-or-homekit">Not working with LIFX or HomeKit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The buttons were working fine for a while with LIFX lights, and all the sudden it stopped working, I tried everything, factory reset on buttons and the bridge, and nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="homekit-support-missing">HomeKit support missing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Warning?, As of Apr 21, 2017, this version does NOT support Apple HomeKit. Supposedly, a V2 is coming soon which will support it.</p>
