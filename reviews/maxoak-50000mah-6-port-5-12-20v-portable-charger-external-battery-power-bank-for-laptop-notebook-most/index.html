<h5 id="amazing-power-bank">🌟 Amazing Power Bank 🌟</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s come to my attention that many people don&rsquo;t really understand what they are buying when they buy a power bank, also known as an external battery. So I&rsquo;d like to start by briefly covering what a power bank is and what the various terms mean that are used when discussing them. If you&rsquo;re already an expert on this topic, please skip the next three paragraphs to read my experience with this product. If you simply want the summary, go to the last paragraph.A power bank is nothing more than an external battery that you can use to power and / or charge just about any device that has a cord that connects to a power source via a standard USB port. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and configurations, but there are really only three things to look for when looking at performance. One is the number of USB ports on the device, another is the amperage (listed in milliamps or amps) available through each port and lastly, the total amount of energy stored in the battery, which may be referred to as &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; for which the units are usually referred to in milliamp-hours, or mAh. If you have a newer Android smartphone or tablet that you want to charge, then you want a power bank that offers a 2 amp USB port. If you have an iPod or iPhone, you can generally get away with a single 1 amp port, but I always recommend having at least one 2 amp port. A power bank with more than one port will, in theory, allow you to charge more than one device at a time. The thing to keep in mind when shopping for a power bank is that manufacturer claims are often inflated to at least some degree. The most often exaggerated feature is the mAh capacity of a power bank and total amperage output is a close second. Capacity is important because more capacity allows you more device &ldquo;up-time&rdquo; per charge on the bank.Power banks generally use a 3.7 volt battery, as do most cell phones, but the USB standard is 5.0 volts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the power bank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged. Because of the voltage conversion and other factors involved, there will always be some energy lost, so no power bank will put out 100% of stated capacity to the device to be charged. The Kayo Maxtar is a little bit more than your usual power bank and I have no idea what voltage its internal battery is, but the manufacturer has been kind enough to list the battery’s watt-hour (Wh) rating, which is 185. To convert Wh to mAh at a particular voltage, all we have to do is divide the voltage into the Watt-hours and multiply by 1,000. So that’s <sup>185</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.7*1000 = 50,000 mAh, which is the given rating of the power bank.Over the past several years, I&rsquo;ve been asked by a variety of sellers to test and review their power banks, and while I always did my best to accurately review each item, it was impossible to get precise, quantitative data on the performance of the banks because the only way to do so is if you have proper testing equipment. You can give anecdotal evidence like &ldquo;It charged my tablet quickly,&rdquo; but you really can&rsquo;t measure the mAh capacity and the amperage put out at the USB ports with any kind of accuracy. Writing informative and accurate reviews is extremely important to me, so I&rsquo;ve since acquired testing equipment that allows me to get precise and accurate data regarding the capabilities of a power bank or charger; and I have to admit I&rsquo;m excited to finally know without a doubt that I&rsquo;m giving accurate information about a product.All that being said, here&rsquo;s what I found with the Kayo Maxtar 50,000 mAh power bank&hellip;This thing is a monster in every way. It’s big (compared to traditional, smaller power banks), it’s heavy and it can charge a wide variety of notebook computers, tablets, phones, speakers and the like. The power bank has 4 USB ports (two 2 amp and two 1 amp ports) that can be used simultaneously and a 20 volt port and 12 volt port for notebook computers and other devices that take barrel type plugs. There is the requisite power button and four charge indicator lights. Unlike other power banks I’ve reviewed, this one does not charge with a USB Micro B cable, but rather with 16.8 volt 2.4 amp cord. This is a good thing because it would take days to charge with a USB Micro B cord.I received my sample of this product and fully charged the device, which took only a short time, because it was nearly fully charged on arrival. I tested the power bank using the same methodology I use for testing all such devices. Using a USB Load Inducer and a meter that measures total mAh, I placed a 2 amp load on one of the 2.1 amp USB ports and let the test run to failure. The power bank ultimately provided 33,843 mAh at 5 volts (45,734 mAh at 3.7 volts) before shutting down. I charged the unit back up and ran the test again, this time the power bank put out 33,716 mAh at 5 volts (45,562 mAh at 3.7 volts). I then charged the unit back up and plugged in the load inducer set to 2.1 amps, my ASUS T100 10 inch tablet, iPod Touch 5G and iPhone 6 into the USB ports. I allowed this test to run for 15 minutes and had no issues at all.In summation, this power bank is capable of putting out a tremendous amount of power to charge a large number of devices. My testing indicates this power bank puts out 91% of advertised capacity and that puts it somewhere in the range of &ldquo;excellent to OMG!&rdquo; as far as actual output versus stated. Anything above 90% of stated capacity is considered stellar and of the dozens of power banks I&rsquo;ve tested and reviewed, only one or two have broken the 90% milestone. Most power banks I test end up having an actual output of between 75% and 85% of stated capacity.If I could rate this power bank ten stars, I would. I get a lot of “okay” and “decent” products to review, but it’s rare that I get something that truly knocks my socks off, and this power bank has done just that. It’s a bit pricy ($125 at time of review) compared to lesser products, but if you like to be prepared to charge darn near anything in the coming Zombie Apocalypse, or if you like to spend days at a time in the woods, but still like to have your tech up and running, this is THE product for you.🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟</p>

<h5 id="hands-down-the-best-battery-bank">Hands down the best battery bank!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>ill start off by saying that this is definitely a power bank that most people need whether its for laptop use or to have on standby for those times when you just don&rsquo;t know, if you might have power. Those other battery banks out there don&rsquo;t have half the rugged ability as the k2, with an exception to some(the sand blasted oxydation is really awesome) .From the photos you can see how compact this unit is compared to an iPhone 6s and to my goal zero sherpa 50.Now lets talk about the options because there are a ton.I have connected the k2 to a HP DV8000 which is the advertised use and works great for that, its worth saying that the HP is a 17 inch screen laptop and the k2 charges and keeps it running at the same time.In addition to HP there are countless other laptops that this battery bank is compatable with, however not with apple laptops.Now physically my macbook pro can be connected to the k2 via a 3rd party cord but this option is not recomended because of the special voltage needs of apple devices.But if you notice i have connected my mac book pro 13 inch to a goal zero sherpa 50 and in return used the sherpa to charge my mac.Now lets talk about the modularity of the systems that you can make,my sherpa 50 is a 50 watt hour device with an inverter for 110 volts, that give my options with other devices when I&rsquo;m out camping in places without power.With the addition of the k2&rsquo;s 185 watt hours capacity that should give me 235 watts of power together.The k2 has a 20 volt and 12 volt output with 2.5 male plug in addition has 4 usb ports 2 of them have a 2.1A and the other 2 have a 1.0A output.This battery pack is truly amazing in every way, if i had to give it one con is the weight but that easily makes up for its true power capacity.In my opinion i highly recommend it!!!!!</p>

<p>The battery is a monster. It has enough power to charge all of your small electronics multiple times. I especially recommend this for camping. You&rsquo;ll be powered for days.In testing this device it completely charged my Lenovo y510p laptop from 5 % to 100 % in about 3 hours. It still had 1 out of the 4 lights worth of power left. It charged my galaxy note 4 ten times and the galaxy note 4 has a huge battery.Things I charged on this:-usb walkie talkies-gopro-Bose Soundlink mini through the 12v connection-power bank portable battery-Android phone- my son&rsquo;s toy gopro-Maxoak desk lamp-rechargeable batteries through the 12v connection-laptop through the 20v connection-I even connected a car socket adapter with a quick charge 2.0 car charger to the 12v outlet. It worked great.Pro:-the battery will charges lots of devices- multiple usb outlets-20v or 12v charging options-50,000mah battery power!-nice designCons:-weight (but for the amount of power it&rsquo;s worth it)-Charging time is about 6hrs. Which is actually pretty quick for a battery this size.Overall I love this battery. I recommend it. The very few batteries out there that are this size go for twice as much. I really recommend this battery if you need this amount of battery.</p>
