<h5 id="a-solid-1080p-ptz-ip-camera-with-night-vision-from-amcrest">A solid 1080P PTZ IP camera with night vision from Amcrest</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I bought this Amcrest IP2M-841 mainly to check on our baby in the crib when I&rsquo;m not in the room. The IP camera needs to have HD video with good night vision view so we can monitor the room 24 hours.The package contains Amcrest IP2M-841 IP camera, Ethernet cable, Power adapter/cable, Mounting kit (Mounting bracket and screws), CD/quick start guide, and User manual. The power adapter/cable is 10 feet long, which makes it easy to find a good spot without worrying power source. This camera does offer night vision although the IR LEDs aren&rsquo;t visible. On the bottom part of the camera, there are Ethernet port, Alert IO, Audio IN/OUT, memory card slot, and power port. Do note that the package doesn&rsquo;t include memory card.To setup the camera is pretty easy. 1. Connect the IP camera to router through Ethernet port (I highly recommend do NOT do first-time setup using the wireless way). 2. Connect the power supply and wait for the camera to be ready. 3. Download and install &ldquo;Amcrest Pro View&rdquo; app and setup the camera through in app instructions ( Connect smartphone to same device as wired connection, scan QR code for serial number, and establish connection to camera). The IP camera can also be setup through PC if you&rsquo;re familiar with finding IP address of device. If not, Amcrest website does offer an utility to help user to locate device IP on the network. For me, I found the easiest way is to check router for connected device and see which one is the newly pop-up right after connecting the IP camera to network.PROs:- 1080P enables to see more detail compare to older IP cameras. This is fairly important as I&rsquo;ll be using this as a baby monitor so I can check on baby&rsquo;s small movements. Night view is quite good on this camera and I can see things with 10 feet clearly (I haven&rsquo;t tried further away). Please see my video and pictures for a demo of day/night view quality on this camera. The video is smooth at 30 FPS and no lag when there is object moving.- PTZ support. Pan/Tilt/Zoom is supported on this camera and it helps to check the area without physically moving the camera. The &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; is digital zoom, not optical zoom.- Wide 90 degree field of view. It&rsquo;s always better to see as much as possible on a single screen.- Build-in Microphone and speaker. This makes 2 way audio communication possible through App.- Motion alerts, Email alerts and snapshots. Also notification alert support through their App. Detection zone and sensitivity can be adjusted for motion alert triggering. Amcrest cloud offers up to 4 hour recording free for 1 IP camera. Free DDNS service is included.NOTE:- This model only supports 2.4GHz WiFi.- This model doesn&rsquo;t offer POE (Power over Ethernet).</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-one">This is the one!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the one! I&rsquo;ve purchased 3 surveillance cameras with the intent of monitoring my girlfriends retail art supply business. She has people stealing $35 tubes of oil paint, $40 sable brushes and so on. All of the other cameras were junk. They were difficult to set up, had little to no customer support and just wouldn&rsquo;t fit the bill for decent surveillance. They all had to go back, one wouldn&rsquo;t even power on after hooking up.This Amcrest is different though. I had to set up on PC first and then connect a tablet. The software is more versatile than anything I&rsquo;ve seen. It was somewhat intuitive and extremely flexible. You can even select certain zones for the lens to NOT monitor during motion detection. The store owner is somewhat computer savvy, but not overly so and had no problems with the operation and adjustment of this camera&rsquo;s parameters. It records to a micro-SD and monitors movement at night after she closes. She has already seen her landlord enter after hours and roam around her store, unannounced. He is on film now&hellip;From my experience, I recommend to just spend the money for this camera if you want something decent. The cheaper ones just won&rsquo;t do it and you&rsquo;ll barely even be able to decipher the ill-written instructions, much less speak with someone you&rsquo;ll be able to understand IF you can contact anyone in the first place. This camera was miles above anything else I&rsquo;ve attempted to set up!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-picture-quality">Excellent picture quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These cameras are impressive. The picture quality is amazing, and so are the viewing angles. I&rsquo;ve had these for a couple of months now and haven&rsquo;t had any problems with them. Setup was easy for me. I see that some others have had issues. I plugged these into my router, powered them up, then set them up with the Internet Explorer since it has the Active X plugins. The browser setup options are rather nice, with plenty of ways to tweak and fine tune things. My only complaint, if any, is the fact that these can move too quickly when running software to control them. There is an option to adjust pan speed, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to stick after closing the browser out.I am running these with Blue Iris 3.6. It doesn&rsquo;t have an Amcrest profile (I believe the new 4.x version does though), so it was a bit of guess work to get them working, but eventually I found the following setting to work quite well:Under video/network IP camera configuration I set Make/model to: RTSP H.264/MJPG/MPEG4The built in WiFi is fine, especially given that there is no external antenna, but I have these outside and where they are placed, WiFi was flaky/non existent. Not a knock on these, as No WiFi camera I have from other brands could reach that range either.Due to some restrictions on placement and household design, hard wiring these isn&rsquo;t an option at this time, so I bought an Edimax CV-7428nS 300Mbps Wireless N300 5-Port Universal Wi-Fi Media Bridge from here. it has worked well with 2 of these cameras and a Foscam HD camera.I actually bought these due to some issues I had with the 2 Foscams, model F19821P. After a bad firmware update on both, they would cut in and out every few minutes. About 2 days later they would finally start working without cutting out. Oddly this was repeatable by powering them off, and the issue would re-occur for a couple of days then stabilize.The picture quality is night and day though between these 2. The Foscam would wash out in lower light conditions with a yellow hue to it, whereas this Amcrest would still have a nice clear picture. Also the night vision and quality is much better with these, plus there are plenty of options to adjust that as well.The biggest thing is viewing angle. For the same given area, the Foscam gave about a 6-8 foot wide viewing area. These give about 12 feet, completely showing the walkway where one of them is placed. The very edges have a slight bow to them due to the wide angle, but nothing obvious that would affect viewing them. I only noticed it due to the door it was covering and the trim around the door had a slight bow to it.Overall these are very nice cameras and do what they need to very well. Plus they have a zoom on them. It is digital though, so you will get some pixelation the closer you zoom, but it still has a good image quality to it when zoomed in.</p>
