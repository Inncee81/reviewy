<h5 id="wonderful-portable-strobe-accessory-kit">Wonderful portable strobe accessory kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As was a little apprehensive about buying this strobe accessory kit after reading several reviews about flimsy design and barely adequate materials. Having only minimal need for my own lighting, I convinced myself to buy it by reasoning that I could just treat it with extra care and deal with the occasional problem of droop or sway. After all, I&rsquo;m a bit of a MacGyver. I was just hoping it was better than what I could make for myself.I have to disagree with the less-than-glowing reviews. I opened each component, one-by-one, each time expecting thin, flimsy, and very breakable piece. I was very pleased to find that everything exceeded my overly low expectations.In particular, the tripod and combination flash/umbrella mount adapter were much better than they were being given credit for. I have worked with more sturdy equipment. But, these pieces will probably endure a fare amount of abuse. I will not need to baby them at all. And, after testing them, I don&rsquo;t foresee ever needing to compensate for or deal with droop, sway, or anything like it.The umbrellas are closer to being as-expected. The quality of construction appears to be comparable to the cheap umbrellas you might find at a discount general store (Dollar General, Family Dollar, Big Lots, etc.). They are obviously made very cheaply and will not stand up to any abuse. But, they appear adequate.Thanks goes to Michael Martin (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AM5ZP7ZZH1HRV/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp">http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AM5ZP7ZZH1HRV/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp</a>) for cautioning prospective buyers about having &ldquo;realistic expectations&rdquo;. It made me one very pleasantly surprised buyer.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-ok-a-bit-cheap-broke-my-flash">It&rsquo;s ok, a bit cheap, broke my flash.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you purchase this, you better understand you are paying for a cheaper product and will need to deal with it. This does the job, but I have broke one umbrella already. One of the umbrellas also lost the little metal piece at the end, exposing a sharp edge.What frustrated me was in part due to my mistake of using this outdoors. I put my flash on it with an umbrella at the park. This mount doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a place for me to weigh it down on the bottom so it becomes somewhat top heavy. I took a risk using it several feet away. Anyway, I dropped the flash onto the ground and broke it. Indoors, this is fine, but cheap. Outdoors, keep an eye on the wind because you can&rsquo;t add a weight to the bottom.</p>

<h5 id="have-realistic-expectations">Have realistic expectations.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a photo shoot of a friend coming up, in Wilmington, and wanted to have an umbrella step up for some portraits. While I am very comfortable using my SB600 flash mounted to the Nikon D90 for portraits I have been interested in getting into more off camera flash photography, especially with regard to portraiture.I purchased this set up based a great deal on it&rsquo;s cost effectiveness and decent reviews. The old adage that you get what you pay for is always in my mind. I came into this with realistic expectations due to the price I was paying, and from comments made by other reviewers here on Amazon.The package arrive as scheduled and was boxed well. All items were in great condition/no damage. After opening the boxes we performed a pre-inspection of the products. First impressions: no suprises here. The light stand is a bit flimsy, but I believe it will do it&rsquo;s job if treated with care. The lightstand hot shoe head has a dissapointing umbrella mount. The socket which holds the umbrella is very loose due to poor engineering. This can be rigged/repaired easily with items around your home.The umbrellas are of a cheap quality, but again I figured as much from the price they were offering the product for. The white umbrella is the better of the three. Both the gold and silver umbrellas with black non-removable backing are a bit see-through when held to the window or other light source. This being said, they both still reflect quite a bit of light and they will certainly serve their purpose of working me into more off-camera portraiture.Along with this lightstand I also ordered the Yongnuo wireless transmitter-reciever set to trigger my flash off-camera. The D90 and SB600 are capable of wireless commander mode, but I hate using the pop up flash as it depleats my camera batteries that much faster. I also ordered a seperate Monfrotto head for the light stand so that the new wireless triggers could be mounted properly.In closing, if you are on a tight budget or just starting to delve into strobist photography this will most likely fit your needs. If you preface your purchase with realistic expectations you will be less likely to find dissapointment. I look forward to giving the stand and umbrellas a full work out in the next few days and will update the review once this has been done.</p>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for-arrived-broken-but-good-for-a-beginner">You get what you pay for&hellip; Arrived broken, but good for a beginner.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be perfect but it should be good to learn on. Cheap or not, a brand new product should not arrive already broken. The stand has 3 legs (tripod) with bars that connect it to the center pole. The plastic at the bottom of the center pole is very cheap and brittle, it was already cracked, and when I tried to open it, it broke off. $30 just isn&rsquo;t worth my time trying to return it. Rather than bother doing a return, I managed to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; it by jerry-rigging it. It works, but I don&rsquo;t anticipate it lasting very long. All of the plastic on it and the head are cheap and brittle, but you get what you pay for. Also, fully extended the stand is a bit wobbly, I definitely would not recommend you use this outside.The umbrellas seem to be the best part of the kit, as it comes with 3. The gold is the biggest of the 3, and the silver and translucent are the same size. The black cover portion on the silver umbrella can be taken off and used on the translucent one, but I would be wary of taking if on and off a lot, as the material seems thin and might tear easily. If you&rsquo;re gentle and take good care of them, they should last a while.Overall the kit is okay. Good for a beginner that is trying to learn off camera lighting without breaking the bank. Despite the broken stand, I would buy it again. It would have been nice to have a carrying/storage case or bag as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A decent, affordable light setup. As long as you understand it&rsquo;s not pro quality and won&rsquo;t survive a lot of abuse, you&rsquo;ll be happy with the purchase. For me it fit the bill at the right price.</p>

<h5 id="click-away-go-on-get">CLICK AWAY, GO ON GET!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time. These are cheaply made. I used it once and the umbrella snapped in half. Save your money and buy better quality.</p>
