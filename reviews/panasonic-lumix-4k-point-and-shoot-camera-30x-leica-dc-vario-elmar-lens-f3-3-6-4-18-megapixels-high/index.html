<h5 id="very-fun-point-and-shoot">Very Fun Point and Shoot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My first Panasonic camera. Purchased this for the zoom, portability and video capabilities. Does fit in pants pocket,but is heavier and larger than I expected. I posted size comparisons with other cameras I own. Very fun camera to have with me all day. Start up is fast. Zooming in and out is fast as well. The lense is silent while zooming. Which is great when shooting video. The lenses I have for my Nikon D5500 are very noisy and constantly re-focusing. Althogh, the video quality on my d5500 is excellent. My Canon SL1 Rebel is much better at shooting video than my Nikon. Canon&rsquo;s STM lenses are extremely quiet. Focusing is much better, too. The zs60 is awesome for video. Even in low light, the zs60 is crisp at 1080p. The 4K video is also a feature I was interested in. Surprising features is the shooting of high speed videos @ 120fps and 240fps. The higher speed will film in 480 resolution, but is still amazing looking.The still picture quality is as expected for the small sensor. Decent pictures, but don&rsquo;t expect lots of depth to pics. Also, cropping your pics will show all of the noise that the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; sensor has.The zs60 feels solid, and has a good weight to it. The control dial on the top and the back of the camera feel cheap. The control ring feels solid. It can be used for manual focusing or changing aperture or shutter speed. Lots of customizations are a attainable because most of the buttons are programmable. The flash is in a bad spot. I have to make sure that i&rsquo;m holding the camera a certain way or my middle finger will partially block the flash.Both viewfinders are amazingly sharp. I never thought i would use an EVF style viewfinder, but this camera&rsquo;s is really nice. It comes in handy if sunlight is extremely bright.The battery seems to have decent life on it. It doesn&rsquo;t compare to my D5500, but it seems about average. A trick I use to keep the screen from coming on when i don&rsquo;t want it is too place a finger near the eye sensor next to the EVF. The menu system is responsive and crisp. There are a lot of features packed into this camera. It&rsquo;ll take a while to try them all out. The artistic filters are excellent. They can turn the otherwise flat pictures into something better.I have shot video in 4k, but I don&rsquo;t have anything to view them with. So I can&rsquo;t comment on that. But i have tried the 4K burst mode of photographs. Almost all of the pics from burst mode were grainy. The backgrounds were very mushy looking. I took them when it was cloudy outside, so maybe I would have better results if the sun was out. Still experimenting.Overall, I really enjoy using this camera.Update: I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out the Wi-Fi on this camera. It&rsquo;s confusing.Regarding the pictures I posted, the first one was shot with Artistic Expression filter in the Creative Mode. The second was shot in iA mode. the third and fourth shows the range of the lens. Look in the middle of the parking lot picture. You&rsquo;ll see the white clock tower. that&rsquo;s at 24mm. the fourth pic is the clock tower at 720mm. 5th-7th are just size comparisons.{UPDATE: 6-9-2016} Now that I have been using this camera for 2 months, I have discovered that the software works for transferring images to my iPhone and iPad. The camera is also able to connect to wireless itself, but you need a Panasonic account for that. I have not signed up for that.I had stated previously that video in low light was great. I was mistaken. I was taking videos in low light of inanimate objects (candles; electric and real). But I discovered that filming people indoors, even with decent lighting is terrible. This camera excels in the sunlight. Taking video of my daughter&rsquo;s preschool assembly is pretty much useless. The zs60 smears, blurs and distorts your subjects. I&rsquo;m still keeping my rating at 5 stars because I haven&rsquo;t been able to put this camera down. It goes everywhere with me. But certain shooting environments really expose the weaknesses of the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; sensor. But, videos and pics I have taken of the moon are awesome! I now appreciate the quality of video and pics of my APS-C cameras more. The zs60&rsquo;s size is great. Very small, and that&rsquo;s the trade off: small camera/sensor, less quality of images.This camera also suffers from rolling shutter, a &ldquo;jello&rdquo; effect when shooting video. This does not occur everytime I have shot video, but it is noticible. On a positive note, this camera is an excellent macro shooter! You can get as close as 5cm from your subject! Videos at close range are excellent as well (all with proper lighting).All in all, this camera is extremely fun to use. I uploaded more pics. A moon shot, a macro shot and a hi-speed 120fps hd quality (slo-motion) video.</p>

<h5 id="great-point-and-shoot-camera">Great point and shoot camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far after checking to make sure everything works as described&hellip;. this is an amazing point and shoot camera.bought this to compliment my main camera canon 70D. I needed a smaller camera to fit in pocket or the bag I carry main camera in&hellip; this works perfect&hellip;. bought this also for the 4K capability and the post focus ability and it all works fine in this small compact camera&hellip; I have the lumix dmc-zs7 and it took good pictures and video&hellip; but the sharpness is way better on this new camera&hellip; I am still messing around on this, so I have not used this in a real scenario scene, only for testing in house and outside, and I am impressed with video and picture quality in such a small camera&hellip; zoom works great and better than all other point and shoot cameras I have used, but I would not zoom in on subjects to max, sharpness gets very dull and cloudy&hellip;. now with my camera, changing focus points in post focus was a little hard to figure out, but once you figure this, I love this feature, and you won&rsquo;t find this in any camera or phone that I know of. Now the flash mode on and off was a little difficult to figure out on my camera, because you can&rsquo;t use flash in 4Kburst or in post focus modes.There are many many functions on this camera I have not yet played with, like changing picture scenes, expressive, monochrome, high key etc, for giving your pictures even more style&hellip; I also love taking video in 4k and freezing frames in action and using that pic to print off.I am getting a charger and a couple more batteries for this, because you do drain the battery quick when in 4K bursts and using post focusing modes&hellip; also it&rsquo;s good to have a strong good SD card, I use the sandisk extreme pro speed class 3, 10.It&rsquo;s still early to see if this camera holds out long because it just came out, but I highly recommend this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Replaced an older model of the same Panasonic. I have a much more expensive DSLR with expensive lenses but this gives virtually the same image quality except in low light conditions. Much less of a hassle to take along this small camera than the big DSLR. We end up using this 75% of the time rather than hauling around the big camera with all the lenses.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-camera">I LOVE THIS CAMERA!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What can i say? You cant buy a better camera for the price. I have owned this camera for about 4 months now have taken over 6k photos with it. I have viewed the 4k photos and footage on my my 4k and they absolutely amazing. Some of the photos look a professional took them. The camera is super easy to use. The low light performance of this camera is out of the world compared to other cameras i have owned in the past. Takes wonderful videos and has great sound, wind does effect it a little but not bad.</p>

<h5 id="4-5-stars-high-quality-highly-portable-camera">4.5 Stars- High Quality, Highly Portable Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been years since I owned a compact camera. (My last few have been DSLR or the similar &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; models). With the small layout, this camera doesn&rsquo;t feel very ergonomic. It took about 6 tries for me to correctly enter the date and time. But I think simply using it enough to get used to the size will help a lot.Picture quality is good. A little too much contrast and the JPEG could be a little clearer. &ldquo;Freeze Animal Motion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clear Sports Shot&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t quite live up to my expectations either. But when I consider all the fun new features packed into this camera along with the price, I can&rsquo;t complain much.Setting things up to control the camera with my smart phone was easy. (Learning how to use the controls was a little harder, but still only took a few minutes.) Trying out the different scenes was fun :-) I am going to get some BEAUTIFUL shots of my garden this spring!I will have to invest in some brighter lights if I want to use this camera for indoor product photography. My previous Canon PowerShot SX50 HS did much better in less-than-optimal lighting conditions.</p>
