<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-charger">Great Charger!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this just for the battery charger as I bought a 4-pack of 1100mah batteries to go with my Syma X5SW drone. This is one of the best 5-port chargers you can get and quickly charges all of them at once. I love it. It&rsquo;s also insanely SMALL. I was expecting something the size of an old USB Pocket charger and this thing turned out to be smaller than a tic tac box so it&rsquo;s perfect for traveling and keeping in a small bag of drone accessories. The two batteries that accompanied the charger are decent but I don&rsquo;t like using anything less than 1000mah for my drone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="batteries-great-charger-meh">Batteries Great - Charger Meh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries are great. Held a charge for the advertised amount of time. However, the charger is very cheap. Connecting the batteries to the charger sometimes requires a bit of wiggling and excessive pressure to get a good connection.Edit: To add a bit more detail here - I am getting a good bit more flying time out of these batteries than the stock battery that was included with my Syma x5. I&rsquo;d say somewhere around 8-10 minutes. Charging is quite a bit faster than the stock charger as well even with the increased capacity. I am able to hook up 5 batteries simultaneously with no heat issues. As I mentioned before, the connections are a bit spotty at times. The batteries are slightly thicker due to the increased capacity. They fit very snugly into the X5 which actually turns out being a good thing because if your battery door pops open you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it falling out.I&rsquo;d definitely recommend if you&rsquo;re in the market for a few extra batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-pleased">Not pleased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Batteries only lasted one monute after charge. Sometime I might get a minute and a half. Not really happy with the performance. Contacted seller and they wanted pictures of the charger and batteries. I was not able to send the pics email as the files were too big. I explained that and they still wanted more info. I finally just gave up and told them I didn&rsquo;t expect a refund - just wanted to let them know their batteries were not up to the advertised standards.Update:I would like to update my earlier review. The batteries still only fly my drone for about one minute. However I now suspect that possibly my drone is pulling more amps than it is designed for and that may be the problem with the batteries. I&rsquo;m going to order new batteries from the drone mfg and compare the two. I would absolutely ulike to pgrade my review to show the service provided by the supplieryour has been very good. They have replaced the charger and batteries and have been in contact with me to assure I am pleased with their product.</p>

<h5 id="just-buy-it-already">Just buy it already&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These fit my Syma x5c PERFECTLY. I get about 8-10 minutes of flight. Don&rsquo;t listen to the haters. I&rsquo;ve charged 3 batteries simultaneously close to 10 times. NO melting, NO fires, NO bulging. This product works just fine and the price can&rsquo;t be beat. Now I fly my quadcopter MUCH more often&hellip; the only downside is that the micro-motors burn out a little sooner but that&rsquo;s not Holy-Stones fault. Smaller brushed motors have limited life span.BOTTOM-LINE: Stop over-thinking it. More batteries = more flying. This is a terrific product.I&rsquo;ve never experienced a melt-down or fire with a battery or charger. That being said, I always take pre-cautions when charging RC hobby batteries. Charge batteries on a non-flamable surface. I charge these in an old metal sink or in a bucket filled with gravel &amp; sand. I also set a timer and never charge over-night. Be safe everyone&hellip; and happy flying!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-i-m-pleased-with-this-purchase">So far I&rsquo;m pleased with this purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I read probably nearly all of the reviews before ordering this. I do understand peoples&rsquo; frustration with some of the stuff coming over here on the &ldquo;slow boat.&rdquo; I have been too but, most often it&rsquo;s turned out OK. And, so far I&rsquo;m pleased with this purchase. I bought these for two new 2015 Syma X5C-1&rsquo;s. Both of these batteries fit only a little more snug than the originals. I didn&rsquo;t have to modify anything. And, the door closes and latches perfectly. I&rsquo;ve only been through one charge cycle but neither one puffed or got hot and they worked well. I was having too much fun and was to busy learning to fly these so I could tutor the grand kids on Xmas to look at my watch but I&rsquo;m sure they lasted at least as long. Also, they charge quicker with this charger. I remember reading somewhere not to try charging this type of battery while it is still warm after you just get through flying a long time. Do be careful about the tiny prongs. If you have it turned correctly it only takes a light pressure/force to get them fully seated. As far as the Syma Quad-copters are concerned, wherever you get them you need more than one battery to make it worthwhile even going out to fly. I have read that having 4 or 5 will cause you to wear out those tiny brushed motors in a hurry though&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-little-drone">Great Little Drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing little drone that is easy to fly and fast. New flyers should fly on a lower setting. The altitude mode works excellent and allows new flyers a chance to get use to the flight stick. I really liked this drone. It also looks super cool and is very stable in the air. It has a cyborg like light in the front which makes it look like an alien ship. I immediately took off the camera since I have no desire to capture video and I wanted the keep the flyer as light as possible. A Phantom or Autel X-star is better suited for aerial photography. I just wanted to fly and do some tricks which this drone does very well. This model has some nifty features too. The battery compartment opens easily and a new battery is easy to installed. The unit comes with two batteries which is also very nice. The controller is easy to use and calibrate. Please make sure you take the time to read the instructions on calibration. The gyros need to be calibrated for the drone to fly best. Another great idea was two cords so you can charge one battery and get this you can even charge one of the batteries in the drone. One last item to mention is the incredible support form Holy Stone. They made great products and stand behind their products. I had some issues with my first drone and the company was a pleasure to deal with. They fixed the issue and my flies perfectly.</p>
