<h5 id="amazing-value-easy-to-install">Amazing Value + Easy to Install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TheQualGear PRB-717-WHT Universal Ceiling Mount is an amazing value for such an affordable product. I used it to mount my Epson 725HD and I am glad that I didn&rsquo;t buy a more expensive mount. This one was easy for me, a 69 yr old man with severe breathing problems, to figure out, then put together and install. It comes with a lot of hardware for just about any configuration and/or projector. I&rsquo;m not sure that it is fancy enough to fit into some multi-thousand dollar home theater, but I&rsquo;m just an average guy with an average TV room and it works fine for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="epson-2040-owner-you-will-need-new-screws">Epson 2040 Owner&hellip;You will need new screws.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me begin by saying this is a very versatile projector ceiling mount. You can adjust the arms and even extend them according to the projector&rsquo;s machine screw holes.I initially bought this for a BenQ HT2050 which I was testing out. This mount was easy to install on it. However, I had to return the projector and I ended up going with the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 2040 (due to ambient lighting in the room). If I had a dedicated Home Theater room, I would&rsquo;ve stuck with the BenQ.Regardless, I figured this mount would work with the Epson 2040; it does not with the given hardware. After some research, I found that the Epson projector uses M4 12mm screws. The Home Depot I visited was out of stock so I got #8-32 x 1 inch screws. The screws didn&rsquo;t go all the way into the mount arm and Epson projector but it holds the projector like a champ.If you can get your hands on the M4 12mm screws, you should be good to go with this projector mount.As for the product itself, it holds the projector well when screwed into a stud and it also allowed me to adjust the projector easily with the awesome pitch and roll design.Overall, its a good product that should work on your Epson <sup>2040</sup>&frasl;<sub>2045</sub> if you get the right screws. The rest is pretty straight forward.</p>

<h5 id="this-right-choice-in-a-crowded-field-of-projector-mounting-hardware-just-awesome">This right choice in a crowded field of projector mounting hardware. Just awesome.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What an incredibly great and thoughtfully put-together product. I was initially daunted by the drawings - but it turned out mounting my projector on the ceiling was much much easier than I thought. This product included ALL the hardware needed for any type of projector and included sets of all screws, mounting hardware, spacers, screws, nuts, wrenches (yes, even the wrenches!) for a complete install. Lots of extras to accommodate all makes and models of projectors (I presume). I don&rsquo;t usually give glowing reviews, but this product went overboard to make sure the consumer had everything he or she needed to make the complete installation in one sitting without multiple trips to a hardware store. I&rsquo;m a tough critic and this time I was really impressed. I read the descriptions of all (yes, every one!) the projector mounting products, chose this one and it turned out to be the right choice. Highly recommended. No, they didn&rsquo;t pay me to say this or give me a free product to review. It was just a great product and deserves this great review.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-mount">Love this mount!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this mount!- Heavy Duty; solid metal construction- Excessive # of screws, spacers, etc. so no matter what projector you have, this mount will work. NOTE: This mount requires your projector have at LEAST 3 mounting holes - it will NOT work if you only have 2.- Each set of screws, spacers, etc. are in separate bags labeled alphabetically. No sorting through items and guessing if you have the right piece, just open the items you need and leave the rest sealed up!Overall, very happy with this. Surprised at the quality for the price, would gladly have paid double.</p>

<h5 id="very-adjustable-and-customizable-mount">Very adjustable and customizable mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount worked perfectly for our projector (Vivitek DH558) - <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0167MWDM2/The">https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0167MWDM2/The</a> kit provides many spacers, screws, bolts, and extra brackets so it&rsquo;s a very customizable device. It contains all of the tools needed as well (aside from a screwdriver/drill of course). It looks intimidating first opening the box, but the instructions were clear and we ended up needing very few of the items it came with.The best thing about this IMO is that once installed, you can adjust your projector in whatever way needed - up/down, tilt, sideways rotation. Very few mounts seemed to offer this level of flexibility, and this was a must for me.It also feels sturdy and not cheap at all. Well worth the price!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yes-it-will-let-you-mount-there-and-project-there">Yes - it will let you mount THERE and project THERE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great with my BenqHT2050. You can rotate the projector and tilt it. So you can pretty much mount it anywhere and project it anywhere. If you&rsquo;re worried about whethere you can mount your projector THERE and still have the image be THERE and at THAT HEIGHT &hellip; yeah&hellip; you can. I was only 50% sure that this would actually serve my needs when I ordered it, but then realized I was unnecessarily worried. It twists and turns and tilts in all the ways you could possibly need it to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-money-seems-to-fit-most-projectors-best-used-if-your-ceiling-studs-run-parallel-to-the-intended-projection-wall">Good for the money, seems to fit most projectors. Best used if your ceiling studs run parallel to the intended projection wall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I only just mounted this so I can&rsquo;t speak to its stability over time; but it seems to be good quality metal with strong nuts and bolts. The packaging is excellent, it comes with multiple types of screws and spacers to fit a variety of different projectors, which is awesome. Most products like this simply say &ldquo;since all walls are different, please use a screw appropriate for yours&rdquo; and provide nothing, or something else equally frustrating. This just gives you a bunch to choose from.It also comes with a handy wall template, so you can measure out and drill holes without needing to hold the actual mount up to the wall the entire time.My only disappointment is that the mount seems to assume the studs in your ceiling run parallel to the wall you intend to project onto. Mine don&rsquo;t; they are perpendicular. This means that I have to mount the ceiling bracket sideways. Which is ok since you can simply spin the projector to face the wall you want, but it will almost certainly cause problems down the road because there is nothing to stop the projector from tipping side to side simply from its own weight when in this position. Over time I forsee needing to manually tip it back occasionally. This wouldn&rsquo;t probably happen if you were mounting it on studs running parallel though.</p>
