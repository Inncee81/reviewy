<h5 id="it-is-the-perfect-size-for-a-few-small-components-like-the-cable">it is the perfect size for a few small components like the cable &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchase this product repeatedly for my TV installations. it is the perfect size for a few small components like the cable box, dvd, player and a gaming system. The slip in side covers over a pretty good sized channel make it easy to conceal the cables leaving a clean finished look.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-very-good-solution">A VERY GOOD SOLUTION</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PROs - I purchased this product a month ago and just installed it to support a new Sony DVD player in our exercise room below a wall TV. Basically, it is a very simple device to install, really needing only a power drill and bit, Phillips screwdriver (or power bit), and the small hex head tool provided in the package. I located the vertical stud I needed, marked two hole locations for the two stud screws (directions say four, but they are incorrect), and mounted the center post. Once the center post was mounted, adding the horizontal glass holder platform was a matter of two screws and a plate (provided). The black glass platform simply sits on top with one screw to stabilize it. Be careful NOT to tighten the glass platform screw too tightly or the glass will crack. The quality of the product exceeds the price I paid for it on Amazon.Overall, this took all of 10 minutes to install, start to finish, and is a product I would recommend to others.CONs - The directions could be a bit more clearer, but they didn&rsquo;t really impede the installation of the platform.</p>

<h5 id="great-combination-to-use-with-wall-mounts-to-cleanly-hold-your-set-top-box">Great combination to use with Wall Mounts, to cleanly hold your set-top box.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome mount, just used this mount to hold my set-top box and got my 32&rdquo; mounted to my wall with it looks great. Easy to install, but the two hex screws that you gota screw in to hold the shelf was kinda difficult because the screws seem small for the holes. But the glossy black shelf just tops everything off. Just remember the two bottom and top Caps should go on at the end once you mounted the vertical plate to the wall and mounted the small 1&rdquo;x 1&rdquo; small square plate that holds the shelf in place, and you can move it up and down to your desire. The only thing I didnt like were the two screws that it came with to mount it. They were very long, and i had about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>&rdquo; inch left that wouldn&rsquo;t drive in any further. and the screw striped very easily. Recommend using slightly shorter and better metal quality screw.</p>

<p>I love it. It looks perfect</p>

<h5 id="attractive-component-shelf">Attractive component shelf.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Aside from the usual issues of packaging and delivery details, which went smoothly, I will focus more on the aesthetics and installation of this shelf. It is attractive and adequate for my use. I have a dvd player sitting on it and the fit is just right. Many comparable shelves were not as deep or wide as this, so the size is good for a variety of home theatre and television devices. I prefer that the shelf be as large as or larger than the component I place on it. I don&rsquo;t like the look of a device straddling over the edges of the shelf. Installation is straight forward, just requires the ability to drill and screw into a stud or otherwise sink a wall anchor. The challenge is in making and keeping the shelf level. The style of securing the shelf brackets is not automatic and is difficult to tighten enough to prevent some movement and therefore going off level. If you have to frequently access and handle the device you place on this shelf, this may detract from your satisfaction. But if the component just sits there, like a cable box, once set, the shelf will stay put.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-some-minor-quibbles">Works well, some minor quibbles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would give this five stars because it looks good, and functions as it&rsquo;s supposed to. But there are a couple issues, which don&rsquo;t really affect my application. I didn&rsquo;t expect to need to mount this to a stud, but it requires it. Locating a stud limits your choices, but I had just found a stud for my TV wall-mount, so it was a simple matter to place it along the same stud. The &ldquo;cord-hider&rdquo; aspect doesn&rsquo;t seem to be great; there are fingers along the edges, but the cord just goes into and out of them. The end-caps are solid, so you can&rsquo;t run the cords out the top like I thought. I guess they&rsquo;d &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the cords if you&rsquo;re going into a wall. And the shelves are a bit small, so your cords would have to bend sharply to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; them. Not an issue for me, but I took away a star for these minor inconveniences. Otherwise it works as advertised, the price is reasonable, and it&rsquo;s a good-looking piece that does the job I needed.</p>

<h5 id="good-but-could-be-better">Good, but could be better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this shelf to go under my TV and Soundbar, holding my PS4, games and controllers. At first glance out of the box it seems like a great shelf, and for the most part it is. It is very visually attractive, hold a fair amount of stuff, and is easy to mount.What I didn&rsquo;t like, is that the shelf feels a bit flimsy. I trust my stuff on it, but wouldn&rsquo;t like to see someone bump into it too hard. It feels as if the tempered glass is too heavy for the mounting center. The wire organizing tracks on both side don&rsquo;t seem to be able to hold many wires either.Overall I like it, and will continue to use it, but I feel a more sturdy mounting surface would benefit the product a great deal.</p>
