<h5 id="the-off-brand-lp-e6-you-can-trust">The Off-Brand LP-E6 You Can Trust</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While prepping to shoot a documentary, I needed a few extra batteries for my Canon 60d, and didn&rsquo;t feel like shelling out the premium price just to get them emblazoned with the &ldquo;Canon&rdquo; name. I mean, it&rsquo;s just a battery after all, right? I checked everywhere, on Amazon, other camera accessory retailers, random review websites, and found that LP-E6 batteries that are not made by Canon are notorious for showing error messages, incorrect capacity readings, etc. TheÂ STK Canon LP-E6 Battery 2600 mAH - for Canon EOS 6D, 7D, 70D, 60D, 5D Mark III, &amp; Mark II Digital SLR and DSLR Cannon Cameras BG-E14, BG-E13, BG-E11, BG-E9, BG-E7, BG-E6 GripsÂ had by far the best ratings &ndash; and from reading other reviews, the best customer service. So great, I thought, worst case scenario, the company backs their product.Upon receiving the STK LP-E6 battery, I charged it up and stuck it in my camera. A little test shooting, left it on for awhile, and it seemed to display correct capacity, didn&rsquo;t run out of juice earlier than expected, and didn&rsquo;t throw any error codes. I invested in another one and tested it in the same way.Since then I&rsquo;ve recharged them probably a half-dozen times, used them on shoots, and never seen a problem with the STK LP-E6 battery. They also hold their charge &ndash; I&rsquo;ve left them in my camera bag for a month or two, and once on the charger, they display 100%. Pretty impressive.In addition, both times I ordered, I received an email through amazon from the manufacturer/seller, stating that if I have any issues, to reply to the email and they would take care of the problem.TL;DR my experiences so far:-Less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the price of &ldquo;Canon&rdquo; manufactured LP-E6 batteries-Holds their charge while stored-Doesn&rsquo;t throw error codes-Reliable capacity levels-Good customer serviceIf you&rsquo;re not going to fork out for the overpriced Canon-brand batteries, these are the LP-E6 batteries to buy!</p>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great Customer Service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review started off as a five star two weeks ago, but things have changed. The first problem took the form of erratic &ldquo;remaining capacity&rdquo; readings from my Canon EOS 7d. It might read 65% after a shooting session and then magically return to 100% after sitting around for an hour or more. It would, however, return to 65% after one or more shots, so I decided to live with this and did not change my review. A week later, it does not fully charge on my Canon charger. After charging overnight, the charger lights were still blinking and the capacity read only 57% in the camera. This has now happened twice. Most recently, the battery failed in the middle of recording a 10-minute video clip when it should have had plenty or capacity left. I haven&rsquo;t decided whether to go through the hassle of asking for a replacement as I don&rsquo;t know if the replacement would be any better. As much as I hate to pay Canon&rsquo;s inflated battery price, I guess I&rsquo;ll stick with them. Too bad as this looked like a really good deal.Update (7-25-2012): After two months, I decided to give Sterlingtek&rsquo;s one-year guarantee a try and called their customer service to find out if it was worth the trouble. They sent a replacement the next day with no grief or hastle. It arrived by Fedex Express and has worked perfectly through three recharge cycles. Given their guarantee and responsive customer service, I now consider the price to make it worth a try and would recommend buying directly from the company. I will update this review if the replacemtnt gives me problems.</p>

<h5 id="working-great-so-far">Working great so far!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s old batteries for his Canon 70D stopped holding a charge for some reason and he needed some new ones. We checked the OEM battery but it was quite expensive. We decided to give these a shot and bought two. He took them with him on a five day fishing trip and they held up fine. He used his camera constantly and they held a charge well. He has been using them for a while now with no issues.They charge quite quickly and seem sturdy. They are working great right now. However, the real test if whether they hold up. My husband bought two non OEM batteries like these two years ago for about the same price and they were great until they stopped charging. Naturally, we won&rsquo;t know for a while how long these last so I removed a star until we are sure that they don&rsquo;t die real quick. I&rsquo;ll update and add the final star in a few months if they continue to work well and hold a charge they way they are now. If they even last a year or two, they will have been worth it considering the price and the amount of use they get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comparable-to-the-oem">Comparable to the OEM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This battery is providing me with comparable power as the OEM battery. It charges properly with the Canon charger and communicates fully with my 60D. I haven&rsquo;t counted how many actual shutter or flash cycles I done with this battery vs the Canon battery, but for me it seems that it holds up right with the Canon. Build quality is identical. I would definitely purchase this battery again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-hesitate-for-a-moment-great-replacement-battery">Don&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment âÂ great replacement battery!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, it used to be the case where third party batteries were a risk to your electronics and sanity. They often wouldn&rsquo;t have decent recharge performance or carried the risk of not playing well with your device.As of about 2005, third party batteries for Digital SLRs have been a no-brainer. Why pay $40 or more for an OEM brand when you can buy a third-party replacement that works every bit as well for under $15?To the naked eye, these look and feel every bit as genuine as the original battery that came with my Canon 6D. And, to be honest, because this battery is newer, it actually performs better than the original battery (which definitely has a lot of charge cycles).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit skeptical while ordering this but only until I received it. Performance is amazing. Lasts more than the default battery from Canon and very cheap as compared to the original canon one. I&rsquo;d highly recommend this.</p>
