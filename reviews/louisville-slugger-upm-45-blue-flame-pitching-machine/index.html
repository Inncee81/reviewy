<p>Product Description
Gamemaster 200160111 Louisville Ultimate Pitching Machine (EA)</p>

<p>Amazon.com</p>

<p>The UPM is sturdy, portable, and requires no electricity.Named the official Pony Baseball and Softball League pitching machine, the Ultimate Pitching Machine (UPM) 45 helps batters and coaches enjoy a more successful batting practice or coach-pitch game. It&rsquo;s sturdy, portable, and requires no electricity, which makes it great for practices and games, home or away. Plus it saves the coach&rsquo;s arm. Because the lever action flicks baseballs with consistent speed and location, it&rsquo;s often used as an alternative in coach-pitch leagues to help overcome the fear factor of live pitching. Young hitters will know where and when the ball will be pitched. For all ages, the UPM model 45 allows hitters to work on specific locations and sharpen muscle memory without turning the coach&rsquo;s arm to jelly.
The Louisville Slugger UPM45 is the ultimate training aid that pitches reliably and consistently for batter after batter allowing the hitter to concentrate on developing a proper level swing path to the ball. The UPM45 is more than just a pitching machine, though&ndash;it also throws accurate fly-balls and hard ground balls consistently to incorporate into your drills and eliminate the need for hitting the ball during drills.</p>

<p>The Louisville Slugger UPM 45 Blue Flame Pitching Machine throws real baseballs and softballs between 18 and 45 miles per hour and soft, lightweight balls up to 60 miles per hour. This machine has been authorized for use by teams in the majority of youth leagues in America including Babe Ruth Baseball and Softball, the Cal Ripken Division of Babe Ruth Baseball,</p>

<p>The UPM allows hitters to work on specific locations and sharpen muscle memory without turning the coach&rsquo;s arm to jelly.Pony League Baseball and Softball, and many more.
For coaches and team managers, the UPM solves any number of problems. There&rsquo;s no need to use special pitching machine balls - it won&rsquo;t rip or tear leather or synthetic ball covers.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>Portable and lightweight at only 25 pounds

<h5 id="batter-up">Batter Up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked as advertised. My Grand Daughter increased her batting average. Fearless hitter! Easy to store, transport and put into use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy-for-improvement">Great buy for improvement!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 7 y/o and 10 y/o loves it. This is a great way to develop your kids skill and confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dont-chase-bad-pitches-any-more">Dont chase bad pitches any more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The hardest thing to find is someone that can throw strikes when you want to work on your hitting. Nothing worse than running all over the place to swing and when you finally get a pitch in the strike zone you get so excited you miss hit it.This machine allows anyone to pitch to you and you know 90% of the balls with be within the hitting zone. Best thing I have bought in 25 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-inexpensive-pitching-machine">Excellent inexpensive pitching machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE after two weeks of moderate use: This doesn&rsquo;t change the stars, but the pin that holds the spring to the bottom lever bent in less than two weeks. I still recommend this, and it can be worked around, but they need to use a stronger metal in the pin.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My daughter is eight years old and in her first kid-pitch softball league. Unfortunately, the girls at this age can&rsquo;t pitch &ndash; underhand is HARD after only throwing overhand previously &ndash; and so she&rsquo;s getting no practice hitting.So we got this weird looking machine and she has improved in just the first three sessions. It&rsquo;s pretty accurate, but each pitch is a little different so my daughter has to actually adjust to the pitches. The adjustments to the machine are simple to make, and anyone can use it. As a major benefit it&rsquo;s not electric and light, so you can take it to the field to play.</p>

<h5 id="louisville-slugger-upm-45-blue-flame">Louisville Slugger UPM 45 Blue Flame</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just recently purchased this for my 8yr old girl. This has helped her a great deal with her game.The softball coach was surpise at how fast she has picked up getting good hits during games.Easy setup out of the box; it takes only minutes to get a good pitching zone. The controls areeasy to use; after one day you pretty much catch on. The next day is simple to get the ball inthe strike zone. I have found that using different softballs; the pitch is different. I also boughta cheap Rawlings pitching and fielding net for $23 bucks at Walmart. I put this just behind the battingzone and it keeps her from chasing balls if she misses; tip-fouls are still a pain. Don&rsquo;t have money fora full batting cage and the net bounces the ball pretty much back to your area. We won the 8U softballTournament. Again this has definitely helped her getting the timing of the swing.Our softball league uses this brand for all their games; works fine.This machine works best on grass or dirt; not concrete or blacktop, etc.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-strikes">Perfect Strikes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used the UPM 45 for a couple of weeks and it&rsquo;s great. Just yesterday my 6 year old T-Baller got in 40 swings and is making contact 50 percent of the time thanks to the pitch consistency. My 8 year old can crank line drives on 3 out of 5 pitches on the slower settings. His coach requested that I keep bringing it to their practices. I&rsquo;ve run the hitting station several times for a group of 8 - 10 year olds and they each get several perfect pitches in just a few minutes.The kids are not afraid to get hit by pitches. Ok, so I hit one kid but that was in an entire practice and he was crowding the plate. They get plenty of extra swings since 3 out 5 pitches are absolutely perfect strikes. We use the UPM 45 with Jugs Lite-Flite baseballs in the back yard to prevent any broken windows. It&rsquo;s quite durable and portable.Pros: Batting practice goes faster.Hitter are not afraid at the plate.Reinforces a level swing since the trajectory is low.Seems very durable.Easy to assemble.Simple to transport.Using Lite-Flite can deliver fast pitches for kids 7 - 14.Can throw fly balls.Cons: The pin starts to come out and has to be pushed in every 3 or 4 pitches. This only takes 2 seconds to recitify but it means bending down an extra50 times during practices.If it get destroyed I&rsquo;ll have to buy another one immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my daughter to practice &hellip; just like the one at her games and there are a TON of settings&hellip; faster/slower/lower/higher. Took 10 minutes to assemble at most</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-pitching-machine">Amazing pitching machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This machine is great. It&rsquo;s very easy to line up a pitch and then throw ball after ball in the strike zone. A shoulder injury has made it impossible for me to get a ball over the plate, so this is the only way I can have batting practice with my son. It&rsquo;s so consistent and easy to use, that I&rsquo;d continue to use it even if my shoulder were healed. I highly recommend it for home and league play.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-say-75-of-the-people-that-use-this-love-it-some-people-need-to-hit-off-of">I would say 75% of the people that use this love it. Some people need to hit off of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this twice a week at batting practice. I would say 75% of the people that use this love it. Some people need to hit off of a live arm.</p>

<p>Works well. Definitely a good purchase.</p>

<p>Daughter has gotten to the point where she wont swing at &lsquo;bad&rsquo; pitches. Says daddy throw strikes. I cannot throw consistent strikes at the speeds i want (higher than a lob) so i&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-product">Fantastic product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a quality machine for sure. Instructions and setup were a breeze. Once you have it dialed in, it&rsquo;ll perform over and over again just the way you want it.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>
