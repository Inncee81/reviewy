<h5 id="unique-quality-sounding-wired-wireless-bluetooth-headphones">Unique Quality Sounding Wired/Wireless Bluetooth Headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> WOW, are these some sweet sounding professional Bluetooth Headphones. I love the unique design and how comfortable they are. They fit really nice in the ear and feel soft on the neck. The sound is close to what on or over the ear headphones sound like. I am impressed by the sound quality. I also love that they include a really nice soft leather type bag sleeve for these. One of the coolest features is that if the 20 hours of battery life isn&rsquo;t enough or your device isn&rsquo;t Bluetooth, these come with a unique feature. You can connect an AUX audio cable to these and go wired mode!! How cool is that. They will vibrate on call and the buttons are soft and easy to press. There are so many things that I love about these that I just know you will be impressed as I was with these. Would buy again!</p>

<h5 id="sound-quality-and-battery-life-are-definitely-highlights-of-the-leophile-zero-s">Sound quality and battery life are definitely highlights of the Leophile Zero&rsquo;s.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is my second pair of headphones from Leophile. I previously bought and reviewed the Leophile Eel&rsquo;s, which I still use regularly when going out for a run (along with my SmartOmi Gee&rsquo;s). The Leophile Eel&rsquo;s are a fantastic neckband style headset, so my expectations for the Leophile Zero&rsquo;s were pretty high. Here are my thoughts thus far:Sound Quality: 4.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - These will not beat the sound quality of my professional DJ headphones (Lasmex E85&rsquo;s), but they sound fantastic. What is unusually good about the Leophile Zero&rsquo;s is that they sound great whether you have the active noise cancelling (ANC) on or off. Overall the sound signature is very well balanced, but does have excellent low end.Active Noise Cancelling: <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - Does it work? Yes, but the ANC is really only meant to drown out low volume background noise. For instance, if my air conditioner is running in the background while I&rsquo;m listening to a podcast, then I can&rsquo;t hear it. However, if one of my kids is yelling for me in the next room over, I will still definitely hear them. These do a decent job of cancelling out noise, but to get better ANC I would recommend an over-the-ear style of ANC headphones.Phone Calls: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - I make a lot of calls for work, and I&rsquo;ve been using the Leophile Zero&rsquo;s for a huge majority of the phones calls over the past couple of weeks, and so far the feedback has been all positive. The microphone will pick up some background noise that the person of the other end will hear, so you may want to make phone calls from a slightly quieter space.Battery Life: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - This is a pretty easy <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. These headphones will easily last you through multiple days of usage. On paper they claim 15 hours of music playback with ANC, or 20 hours if you have the ANC turned off. While I have not tested the exact battery life I&rsquo;m getting, I can say that they do last for well over 10 hours.Design: <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - The biggest drawback in the design of these headphones is that there is no way to retract the wires like you can with most neckband style earbuds. If that were an option with these this would be a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s not.Bluetooth Connectivity: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> - I&rsquo;ve found the Leophile to have excellent Bluetooth connectivity. I&rsquo;ve been using them with my HTC U11, and the connection between the two can easily go past the 33ft. that they claim. I would venture to guess that the connection is fine until about 50 ft.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-quality-great-design-a-must-have-pair-of-headphones">Great Sound Quality, Great Design, A Must Have Pair of Headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For a very long time I have used Leophile’s other headphones and was waiting for them to come out with a new pair that was better than the ones I originally had. And well Leophile did just that, at first, I was a little scared about the price point because normally I don’t spend $100 on headphones unless they are Beats. But I decided why not give these a try since the other pair I had from them impressed me. These did just that.So, one thing I like about this pair is the sound quality is amazing compared to their other pair. And it&rsquo;s not just a small improvement it was a big improvement. You can easily listen to any type of music with these at max volume and you won’t notice any sound issues, like I did on their other pair. So, I’m really impressed with the sound quality. These headphones also have Active Noise Cancelling when you enable it on the headphones. With my test, the Noise Cancelling seemed to work great. You will be able to hear things if some is by you, but with any other background noise you won’t hear a thing. Lastly, you can also use this as a Bluetooth headset too, so when you get a call, the headset will vibrate to notify you to answer. So that is a really nice feature.Now to the overall design, I love the design of these. Its comfortable to use for a long period of time. And the ear buds stay in your ear very securely, so if you were to use these in a car you don’t have to worry about the earbuds falling out of your ears. It would be awesome to see them come out with a white pair of these.Overall, I am really impressed with these headphones, and these will replace the pair I use when I travel because, the audio quality is amazing and the Active Noise Cancelling works great too. So, if you are looking for a nice pair of headphones when traveling or even just working around the house, these are the ones to get, I know they are a little pricey for unknown branded headphones, but I see Leophile getting really big in the near future. Also, these headphones have some cool features that I have yet to see other brands implement, like the included cable that allows you to use these headphones when the battery is low. So, I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone that is looking for a nice pair of portable headphones!</p>
