<ul>
<li>Industrial-grade chips and precision components are adopted for all the controls. Therefore, the controller performs well in very low and high temperature, as well as humid environment. At the same time, with the use of crystal timing control, the timing function of controller is much more reliable.</li>
<li>Various protections include over-charge, over-discharge and over-load, as well as unique electron short circuit protection and connection-reverse protection. All the protections are harmless to any parts and fuse; fuse only as the end protection of a controller itself to protect the amount of internal short circuit damage. None wore jumpers design improves the reliability and durability of the products.</li>
<li>Scientific management of battery: as it is overcharged, the battery will get booster tension charge. As a result compulsory maintenance is available for the battery. In normal working state, the direct charge and floating charge are both available, so that the battery life-span is increased. Besides, the adoption of high precision temperature compensation makes the charging more accurate</li>
<li>Comparing with the charging loops using diodes, the one that adopts double MOS series circuit control makes the voltage loss dropped by 50%. With the PWM fuzzy control in charging, the charge efficiency is improved a lot.</li>
<li>LED screen shows the working state of solar battery, storage battery and load. LED shows the adjusted parameter. In this way, users can learn the operation state in real time. Besides, there are various choices for parameter; users can select the proper working mode based on the different conditions.</li>

<h5 id="nice-charger-poor-manual-luckily-it-s-simple-enough">Nice charger, poor manual. Luckily, it&rsquo;s simple enough.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have it powered by a 100W panel, charging two 12v batteries and recharging electronics from the load terminal.It works. The LEDs tell you whats going on. Easy.But the manual. Pretty confusing when it comes to the operational modes - so this is how it works, in reverse order:Mode 17 - PV Off = Load is On from Battery, and vice versa. No delay.Mode 16 - Load is always OnMode 0-15 - PV Off = 10 minute delay Load is On, plus stays on for 0-15 hours after PV On.Shame there is no mode where the Load is On only when there is PV power is On.</p>

<h5 id="you-need-to-upgrade-to-this-controller">You need to upgrade to this controller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Intelligent no; BRILLIANT. The best I&rsquo;ve ever had. I am a certified Class II electronics engineer and I can tell you that this controller works the way they always should have worked. By maintaining a moderate charge rather than cycling on/off at 14.4v it brings the batteries up to optimum charge quicker and makes them hold the charge longer. It&rsquo;s what we call a &lsquo;hard charge.&rsquo; And this charger is hard to beat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-regrets">No regrets</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have mine connected to a 50watt panel and 14ah gel cell. So far, so good. Yes the instructions are ridiculous, but if you can set it to mode #16 you should be good to go.I was a bit skeptical for the low price, but a fairly simple charge controller is easy to mass-produce these days. It&rsquo;s likely a copied design, but who cares. Cheaper solar is a good thing in this day and age. It&rsquo;s not the highest quality and shouldn&rsquo;t be used in a mission-critical situation (breathing machines? iron lungs? nuclear reactor cooling system?) . However, it does its job very well and is very reliable for my simple uses.I don&rsquo;t ever plan on running 30 amps out of it, but I don&rsquo;t doubt that it probably could. (maybe keep away from flammable things?) I have a 20amp fuse installed in-line. it seems to have short protection built in though. I&rsquo;ve accidentally shorted the load and it disables current for a few dozen seconds.It&rsquo;s kept my gel cells topped off for several weeks now. All I use it for are lights, fan, and phone charging in a travel trailer. I only had trouble when I left the panel in the shade for a few days, it seemed to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; that it exists and I had to re-set the mode to 16 again.</p>

<h5 id="simple-effective-solar-charge-controller">Simple effective solar charge controller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as advertised so far, I&rsquo;m using it with a single 15W solar panel and a small AGM battery. Pretty simple to use, once you figure out how it&rsquo;s programmed&ndash;the poorly-translated engrish instructions are not a lot of help.The status LEDs are helpful: they indicate status of panel and battery, as well as when the load is switched on, which helps with initial setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solar-charge-control-panel">Solar charge control panel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. If you know what you are dealing with then this charge controller will do a job for you. You just have to be sure to size the job to the controller or reverse. It&rsquo;s inexpensive and will work with a small system for a DIY solar experimenter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="utter-garbage-buy-something-else">Utter Garbage. Buy something else.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Utter and complete garbage. I bought one and it worked for a couple of weeks before it stopped working. Something internal must have blown because it stopped charging the battery. So, I exchanged it for one of the same type figuring that I must have just gotten a dud. The new didn&rsquo;t even work at all. This time, it won&rsquo;t supply any voltage to the output. Battery charging is fine from the solar panel as the battery is still holding near max voltage when checked with a multimeter. However, neither of two different inverters will power up from the output of the controller. And, no, I didn&rsquo;t hook it up wrong. I am a Electronics Field Engineer and have installed/maintained much more intricate equipment than this before. I was willing to give this company a second chance, but not a third. I would recommend against buying this charge controller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-device-not-worth-the-money">cheap device not worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Took awhile for my total order of solar parts to get delivered and then I was held back by rain. After final installation of panels and batteries I ran the wire connecting the controller. Connecting the batteries first, then load, and finally the final connection of the solar aray. The load, (750-1500 watt inverter ) worked fine until the solar connection was made. All wires were rechecked and fuses reinstalled. no luck. Charger will work to charge batteries, but when connected will shut-off the voltage to the load connection. Once the solar connection is removed, ( no solar charge ) the load will work again from battery charge that is present. I can only think that the wiring internally is not correct. Device is useless. I purchased a 30 amp Morningstar controller for $137.00 and will reinstall in this setup. Spend the money and get a BETTER product. Supplier would not refund my purchase</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="hopefully-it-will-last-a-while">Hopefully it will last a while</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to replace a Renogy charge controller that was starting to act up after about 3 years (I have 4 of those). This appears to be made by the same company as it very similar, just in a smaller package and has more modes.One possible issue with this unit as well as the Renogy units is that there are 6 power transistors inside that use the back panel as a heat sink. However I don&rsquo;t feel confident that the heat sinks on the transistors are all making good contact with the back panel. So my solution was to get a tube of heat sink compound (thermal grease) and put a dab on the back of each transistor. This will guarantee that you have positive transfer of heat to the rear panel. I dropped one star for this potential issue that could have been easily prevented.If operating at max current, I would also recommend a small fan to help dissipate heat. The back panel is ribbed, so that would help with air flow.Only time will tell if this holds up long term, but for the price, it is a good deal.</p>
