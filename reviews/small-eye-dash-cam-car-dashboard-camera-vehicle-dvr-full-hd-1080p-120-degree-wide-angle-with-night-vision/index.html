<h5 id="it-has-great-video-quality-and-even-pics-up-sound">It has great video quality and even pics up sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has great video quality and even pics up sound. Requires an sd card but almost everything does now and days. Very easy to install and has a charge cable to plug into the cig lighter port. Suction to the window and ready to go. No need for the software if the license plate is in front of you. In my own opinion this lil camera is all I need especially driving for a living.1080p HD resolution, good clear viewing. The picture quality is really good and better than others I&rsquo;ve seen online.</p>

<h5 id="good-dash-cam">Good dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to install and set up and it works great as described. It included a regular charger and a car charger which was a great bonus. The picture quality is pretty good especially in normal condition. Adheres well to my windscreen securely even with bumps in my truck. Good price for a great dash cam!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-too-bad">Not too bad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this cam knowing you get what you pay for but to my surprise it worked well. The quality is not poor quality but not true 1080p quality. Already used it for identifying a vehicle I had a passed was able to get the license plate number with the help of some photo rendering software on the computer. No need for the software if the license plate is in front of you. In my own opinion this lil camera is all I need especially driving for a living. An av output would be nice but not necessary. I have not driven yet at night time to test the infrared LEDs will have to test that out</p>

<h5 id="i-really-like-this-dash-cam">I really like this dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I really like this dash cam, it has up to 1080p 30fps settings, but I just usually use 720p 30fps for my settings. This dash cam has an auto power on and off whenever you start the car or turn off the engine. It is very convenient as not to worry when to record. It also has a loop record setting which I set on 10 mins. This dash cam record in AVI format, and also captures audio. I recommend this product to use on your car to document anything that needs proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very neat camera, got it as a gift for my brother and he is very happy with it he said that it works extremely well. It was easy to install,and use. Takes great picture view and is very practical. It is a very good small dize so the view of the road is not at all obstructed. Perfect little thing.</p>

<h5 id="great-investment-to-protect-you">Great investment to protect you</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a new truck recently, after having a car hit me and totaling my other car. Even though it was proven the other driver was at fault, it got me thinking of how I need a video camera to film these stupid people on the road for proof at accident. I have watched several dash cam footage videos and have come to the conclusion that all cars should have a dash cam. I just wish this had a rearview cam as well for people behind me. The picture quality is really nice on this item, I was surprised because the cost isn&rsquo;t very expensive for this camera. Definitely worth the investment on any car, especially if someone walks out in front of you to collect on insurance. This thing will help protect you in case of a accident caused by someone else. It has different ways to hook it up in the car, but the way I am using it, I use the cigarette lighter to power it up. You have to pre-charge this before using, as it comes with power pretty much depleted. It charges fairly fast though which is awesome. It does turn off when it is not in use but turns on and records when needed. Use a micro SD card, which you need to purchase separately.</p>

<h5 id="great-little-dash-cam-for-the-money">great little dash cam for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great little dash cam for the money. there are a lot of options out there, trust me I searched just like you. For the price, it does a pretty good job. I set it up and I keep it plugged in all the time. I had a few close calls on the road and thank goodness thatI had footage if i needed to show authorities. the night vision is not bad, clear for most part. If you leave it on battery it blinks, so I leave mine plugged in all the time. I set the loop function so I don&rsquo;t care what happens when it does. lots of features&hellip; I like it!Good luck.</p>
