<h5 id="a-good-value-suction-mount-with-lots-of-flexibly">A good value suction mount with lots of flexibly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to start out by saying I&rsquo;m a fan of Panavise gear - it&rsquo;s one of my goto brands right there with Manfrotto, but it&rsquo;s a bit less polished and bit more industrial. I have a couple of their ball heads (that are similar in design to the ballheads on this, but all metal which is much nicer but also much heavier) and they&rsquo;re rock solid - plus I can buy a couple for the price of one 482 (which is probably the closest analogy).I have a couple of suction cup mounts, but in general I try to avoid using them as much as possible because they can be tricky to work with (getting good contact, not damaging the surface, being rigid, etc). My favorite suction mount is basically 4x the size of this one, pump actuated and about 4x the cost (no ball heads) - but could hold a DSLR if it needed to. So how does this compare to it? Very well - I&rsquo;m not going to put a DSLR on it, but it holds a GoPro like a champ, and their ball head system gives you a ton of options. Keep in mind that in general you want to use as few adapters between the suction cup and the camera as possible - that gives it the most rigid configuration.It&rsquo;s worth point out that while these ball heads look nearly the same as their other ones, they are definitely not as heavy duty and use more plastic components. This is probably more due to weight than cost reduction, but it&rsquo;s worth pointing out - I definitely prefer their metal ball heads over these, except for the camera locking nut, which I like better on this (I think it&rsquo;s easier to lock in place than the metal one).For the money, I think you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this mount, it&rsquo;s got a ton of flexibility in camera positioning, the suction mechanism itself is nice with an easy release, and it&rsquo;s perfect for pairing with a light weight camera like the GoPro. I&rsquo;m pretty picky when it comes to mounts, especially suction ones because the last thing you want is to save a couple bucks buying a cheaper one and watch your camera fly off because of it. Oh, and never use a suction mount without having a tether on it - just because you buy a good mount, don&rsquo;t tempt fate. ;)</p>

<h5 id="extremely-configurable-for-a-variety-of-needs">Extremely configurable for a variety of needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked at several other similar products for mounting my smartphone, action camera, etc. in various locations. When adding to my kit, I want items that can be used in many different scenarios; you never really know what situation you might be in on the road. This kit has a great deal of utility as it can be configured with zero, one, or two ball joints and either a GoPro style mount or a traditional <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; tripod mount. This means it can hold nearly any small device (I don&rsquo;t think I would trust the suction cup with a heavy DSLR) in just the right angle needed to get your shot. The suction cup lock works smoothly and has no issue grabbing a smooth, clean surface solidly. Overall, I highly recommend this kit for anyone who wants a flexible suction mounting solution for small to medium sized devices.</p>

<h5 id="ok-i-was-looking-for-an-action-camera-suction">OK, I was looking for an action camera suction &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK, I was looking for an action camera suction mount to use to film helicopter students during flight instruction. I mostly use it to film students from the inside of the aircraft so that we can review the lessons after the flight. I have also used it to take action videos with the mount stuck on the outside of the aircraft. I have use the suction cup on glass, on painted sheet metal, and on platic (Lexan I think) windshield. This thing holds solid with a GoPro4 silver mounted to it with all the vibrations of an aircraft. It has stayed solid at windspeeds of up to 120kts. That&rsquo;s about 138 miles an hour. (Max cruising speed of a Robinson R44). If you have any doubts, a drop or two of water will make the seal practically unbreakable. Most of the parts are made of metal including the arm and ball joints. The quality of the plastic bits that are used in the construction this mount are top notch.Basically, if you&rsquo;re looking for a mount with which you can trust your expensive action camera too&hellip; this is it. This is a serious mount!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-and-bargain">Great quality and bargain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very strong suction cup! I purchased this to mount a McNett Flux LED light on it and it works great. I can mount the light horizontally on any smooth surface and it holds. For reference the light weighs 24 oz. Sorry the photo I posted is rotated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid">Solid.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid little mount. It doesn&rsquo;t look as strong as it actually is but I have trusted panavise for a while now and this device hooks positively and securely to the point you wonder if it is going to damage something. This kit is a bit like a rubes goldberg machine until you read the instructions and then it just gives you a ton of options.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-sucks-it-s-great">THIS THING SUCKS!!! IT&rsquo;S GREAT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was purchased to replace a dash cam mount. The original mount would constantly fall off, almost weekly, most likely due to temperature changes and whatever but this one has been on for over a month with crazy hot (+100) temps and still holding strong.It was a little difficult to tighten the knob after the camera is screwed in but it wasn&rsquo;t impossible.I definitely would purchase this if you need something to stay in place for long periods of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="grippy">grippy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It gripped my windshield pretty well the one time I used it. I got it to mount my Polaroid XS100 to my helmet while driving on track, but the stick on mount that came with the camera was in the way (lost pieces of it). I stuck it to my windshield instead and found it puzzling to find a configuration that facilitated pointing the camera forward for a view of the road ahead. There was a piece that worked with the slope and narrow clearance of the windshield, but it inverted the camera (the camera oriented the video properly). Although it did not work as I had hoped, I am satisfied with it. I have not tried it outside the car yet. Despite its seemingly good grip on the window, I would tether it if used on the outside.It held the camera steadily enough for very little jitter in the video (keep in mind that the camera does have an anti vibration feature). I do not know how steadily it holds with long arm attached.It looses one star because it is not as versatile as I had hoped.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-one">The one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Want to keep your camera, feel confident about the mounting, get the right angle? This is it! I&rsquo;ve done over 130 mph with this mount. I first saw it used by multiple major car reviewers and racers. That convinced me. Go for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In the little time I&rsquo;ve had it I can tell this thing is going to work out great, the huge suction cup doesn&rsquo;t make me nervous mounting on the outside of the vehicle for video</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="7-5g-strong-and-awesome">7.5g STRONG AND AWESOME!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>7.5g rated. There is not a better GoPro mount out there. Swivels whichever direction you need and the suction cup holds strong under 7.5g&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the GoPro it is excellent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-panavise-quality">Great Panavise quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Incredibly versatile kit, much more substantial than the inexpensive sets with dozens of flimsy plastic bits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-window-mount-in-a-car-for-a-gopro">Best window mount in a car for a GoPro.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tried a couple of others. They stayed on the window just like this one but they shook because of the weight of the Hero 3 on long arms.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent quality and vise grip on my windshield. The mount is easy to change out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-great-so-far">Work great so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Work great so far , giving it a four due to not having it too long , so we see how it works out , very adjustable, little hard to get off window after sticking it on , but thats&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent</p>

<h5 id="the-king-of-suction-cup-mounts">The king of suction cup mounts.</h5>
