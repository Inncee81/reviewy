<h5 id="mighty-little-wonder-keeps-me-nice-and-cool">Mighty Little Wonder - Keeps Me Nice and Cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first Vornado fan; I bought this little guy because I wanted a small fan to cool me directly while sitting at my desk in my home office. I have 2 separate desks in this room, and I wanted a fan that would hit me at one or the other when it was moved. Well, I placed this small wonder on the floor, turned it on high, and I now sit in peace and quiet, and coolWhen I first bought this &ldquo;desk&rdquo; fan, I was concerned that it might not work on the floor, but I was hoping that with its flexible neck design that I could point it in any direction - even straight up - to create a steady stream of air. And I have been able to achieve this steady stream of air with this little powerhouse sitting on my floor about 3 feet from me. Since it is so light and portable, I just pick it up with the built in &ldquo;handle&rdquo; (the space between the bottom of the fan housing and the top of the base) and move it 5 feet away to my other desk. I think that is real convenience - no need for a large fan taking up space or buying 2 smaller fans for each area; this fan does it all.For being a fan with a grill opening just shy of 5 inches, I must say the air pressure it can put out is impressive. On low, I can feel the full air column about 10 feet away, that tapers off to a slight breeze around 15 feet away. On high, it can push that air column 20 feet, tapering off to a slight breeze about 23 feet away. The noise level on low is quiet, but high tends to be a little bit noisy (but not putting out enough noise to distract me). I generally work in solitude in my office since I live alone. I even answer the phone with the fan on high, and it does not disturb my side of the conversation and when I have asked those I am speaking with on the other end, they inform me that they hear nothing in the background, certainly nothing resembling the sound of a fan when I ask about the specific item I am asking them about for the noise. Therefore, although I run this fan on high all the time, the noise level does not bother me, although I am sure it might be somewhat annoying to others.I can then turn this fan on rotate and it circulates the air to an even greater degree. I can make sure I point it to discharge a blast of air underneath my desk to keep my feet nice and cool. This little fan has it all. This fan looks nice with the glossy black finish, and with the small footprint - it is only about 6.5 inches across and about 6 inches deep. Pointed straight up when fully open it is just a bit above 9 inches high, and when closed it is only about 8 inches high. In addition, when this fan is in its closed position, I think it looks like a little piece of modern art. Of course, I know nothing about art - so I will just say that it looks nice totally closed.A couple of things that I think they should change concern the ON/OFF switch. I have to be holding the fan to operate the OFF, LOW, HIGH and back to OFF switch. Surely then could come up with a better switch on the side plastic casing or in the back where the rotate switch is located. Going along with redesigning the ON/OFF switch, I think they should put a MEDIUM speed on this fan. I am sure it can accommodate a middle speed, and since most fans have 3 speeds, it would bring this fan in line with other fansThis item really lives up to the Vornado reputation of building quality fans and are great at keeping the areas around them nice and cool. I am certainly glad I invested in this fan - I hope the durability is in line with its superior performance (in another 6 months or so after I have had this for over a year).</p>

<h5 id="it-blows-away-the-competition">It blows away the competition</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this little fan here for my desk at work it&rsquo;s a very nice works very well it&rsquo;s quiet too little louder than I thought it would be but no concern there for the amount of air that it does push. It has really nice sleek design it is very easy to use. Definitely looks much nicer than the standard fans you would see I like that it looks is very appealing on a desk versus a conventional fan</p>

<h5 id="love-it-perfect-for-small-office-cubicle">LOVE IT! Perfect for small office/cubicle.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Vornado V8 Flippi delivers on its promises. The clean lines, small size, variable output, and oscillation brings adaptability to small-office cooling and air circulation.The appearance and size are perfect for a small office where often all of the available work- and shelf-space is limited. I have mine on a shelf in my credenza/book-case, on a shelf where I keep 3-ring-binder reference materials. It takes up little space and blends well with the black binders and cherry wood finish.I really love the way it moves air and the vertical range of air-flow adjustment. Often, oscillating fans have a limited vertical adjustment for air-flow direction (if they have vertical adjustment at all), and the air flow tends to send loose papers on my desk flying. The Vornado doesn&rsquo;t, even though it is putting out more air than my previous fan.The Vornado is quieter than my previous fan, but still provides the white noise I need for the occasional times when communication privacy is needed. I train incoming staff, and my office in the training room is a large cubicle (so I can be available to trainees should they have issues during the training program).My husband also loves the fan, and will be purchasing one for his psychotherapy offie.</p>

<h5 id="i-own-a-vornado-vfan-jr-vintage-and-i">I own a Vornado VFAN Jr. Vintage and I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own a Vornado VFAN Jr. Vintage and I was hoping this fan would be similarly &ldquo;whisper quite&rdquo;, unfortunately it most certainly is not. For the amount of noise it emits, it moves around a disappointing amount of air.It seems relatively well built - swivels with ease, oscillates smoothly and without creaking, the switch isn&rsquo;t all that hard to turn, but when it&rsquo;s by your head on a nightstand, it makes a crackly sound unlike other Vornado products (or perhaps Vornado products of the past).Needless to say I&rsquo;m returning this. Props to Amazon for the seamless returns system.</p>

<h5 id="impressive">Impressive!..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having recently purchased the V6 version of this and loving it so much, I acquired this &lsquo;upgraded&rsquo; version as well. The V8 Flippi is even better (of course) with more powerful circulation; Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the &lsquo;unexpected&rsquo; addition of a self-powered oscillating base on this version, with the on/off switch for that option located on the backside of the base. This truly is a great little fan and was an outstanding value too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-but-very-loud-for-a-fan">Works great, but very loud for a fan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Moves air for sure in a small package. The switch to turn off ocillating resets every time you turn the fan off and I&rsquo;ve found this to be a very nice and unexpected feature.However it&rsquo;s loud. Like 60db (according to an app on my phone so take that for what it&rsquo;s worth). But I intended it as a bedside fan. It&rsquo;s far to loud for my wife to sleep through. It&rsquo;s even to loud for my cubicle at work, I am in a fairly quiet area with IT people who actually work and not talk all day though. I think it&rsquo;d be fine in a room with normal conversation. But it&rsquo;s supprisingly loud in any &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; environment. With or without the oscillation on.</p>

<h5 id="bought-4-all-broke-within-one-year">Bought 4, all broke within one year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought in Nov, dead by July. This is our 4th and last one we will buy. If you want a fab that lasts 9 months, this is it. Otherwise consider another option.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-switch-on-this-fan-is-in-a-ridiculous-place">The switch on this fan is in a ridiculous place &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The switch on this fan is in a ridiculous place&hellip;switch it on/off - lo/hi and the fan moves all over the place. Other than that it works well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-fan-with-not-taking-up-a-lot-of-space">Great fan with not taking up a lot of space!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I now have 4 of these! Great size and with oscillation, it can really circulate the air in a room, without taking up a lot of space!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-not-super-loud-but-i-have-to-turn-it-on-low">its not super loud but i have to turn it on low &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it sits on my desk&hellip;..its not super loud but i have to turn it on low during telecons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="loud">Loud.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too loud. Two speeds, both loud and both push too much air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="oscillating-feature-quit-working">Oscillating feature quit working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This worked beautifully until today. The oscillating feature quit working. I haven&rsquo;t even had it for 2 months. Very disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 love these fans!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">Worth it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Takes up less space than the fan it replaced while moving at least the same amount of air, much quieter as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for desktop.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-have-returned-this-but-waited-too-long-very">Would have returned this but waited too long. Very &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Would have returned this but waited too long.Very noisy and unpleasent for a small fan.Based upon this i would not buy their products again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent. Very well in ventilation. Small in size. Hope other people see my comment and make this good choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-excellent-not-super-quiet">It&rsquo;s excellent. Not super quiet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unusual to have a fan this small move this much air and also oscillate. It&rsquo;s excellent. Not super quiet, but very powerful.</p>
