<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-mistake-at-any-price">A Mistake at any price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but this unit is a waste of time and money. When using with batteries there are enormous pitch fluctuations, and regardless of whether you are using batteries or AC power there is a chopping sound during play of any cassette that shoulds like there is a helicopter circling. The first 15-20 seconds of anything you transcribe to flash drive is chopped off consistently.The itea of the unit is wonderful, but the transport mechanisms and the fault in how it cuts off the beginning of each song cost me hours and hours of time to end up returning the thing. Grrrr&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-thing-works">This thing works.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write many reviews but there are a lot of gizmos out there and I thought people should know what they are getting here does what it says it does. It transfers cassettes (at play speed) onto a usb memory stick. Features I love about this is the usb power option. I plug it in and it has power, I have never put batteries in it. Which is awesome because a dead battery would probably ruin a transfer. It is simple to use I put the tape in, press record, start play&hellip; when it pops done at the end I press record to stop it. I am transfering books on cassette so don&rsquo;t know how the auto song break feature works look to another review for that.What I don&rsquo;t like is that the device is lightweight and not very durable. It could get crushed if I was packing it around. The battery door for example is flimsy. Also mashing on the play button I heard a pop, and rattle. A screw head that anchors the circuit board poped off. The board was still fimly in place so I glued the weak corner and have had no other problems. I do go easy on the record on/off now.Cheers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-buy-it-again">I would buy it again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get it to get power from my computer but have had similar problems with other devices. However, with the AA batteries, it works perfectly, exactly as advertised. Well worth the money, if you have cassettes you want to preserve in mp. Super easy to use. I would buy it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-points-to-poor-quality-control-at-minimum-if-it-is-not-a">it points to poor quality control at minimum if it is not a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While this device is compact and fairly simple to use, none of the cassette play, fast forward, or rewind buttons actually latch in position for normal operation. I had to hold the buttons down to play or fast forward or rewind. Obviously if one is trying to convert a cassette to an MP3 file, or just trying to listen to a cassette, one should not have to continuously hold down the play button to do so. Maybe this specific device was defective, but if so, it points to poor quality control at minimum if it is not a design flaw.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-won-t-recommend-anyone-to-buy-this">I won&rsquo;t recommend anyone to buy this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I gave this item a 2nd chance but quality of this product is trash. It almost destroyed my tape. I won&rsquo;t recommend anyone to buy this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>USB power did not work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-heavenly-delight">A Heavenly Delight!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this Cassette to mp3 Converter! Very easy to use and set up&hellip; I am transferring a lot of my pastor&rsquo;s sermons to .mp3 files, so I can email them to fellow parishioners&hellip; and to archive all the sermons&hellip; Having worked with audio before, here are some things I do to make life easy: I bought and formatted a 32Gb Flash Drive, to the recommended FAT-32 Protocol&hellip; I only use the power plug to run the Cassette Player &ndash; I do not use the batteries at all&hellip; I &ldquo;pack&rdquo; all of my audio cassettes before playing them in the player. What I mean by &ldquo;pack&rdquo; is, that I fast forward the audio cassette in another tape player, turn tape over and fast forward again. This gets rid of all wrinkles, dust, dirt, etc&hellip;.. I do a test record with a sermon tape, load the file into my computer, transcode it to an .aiff file, load the .aiff file into my Audacity software, check record levels &ndash; NOTE: If record levels are too high, you will see that the audio spectrum signal is &ldquo;Squared off&rdquo;. That means that the audio level was set too high on the Cassette to mp3 Converter&hellip;. When I do an actual record, I hit the button to start the .mp3 file record, wait approx. 5 seconds and then hit the play button to play the tape. Once a proper .mp3 audio has been recorded, I load it into Audacity, edit the file to its proper length, clean it up, save as an .aiff file and then re-transcode to a .mp3 file&hellip; There is NO loss in audio quality &ndash; In fact, the audio sounds better!</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Such a pleasant surprise! I own thousands of cassettes! The result of having played in bands through most of my adolescence and up into adulthood. Questioning my need for a cabinet full of cassettes I never listen to, my wife tried to buy me another cassette to mp3 converter in the past and it was such a pain to use, that I used it once and never touched it again. Fast forward to earlier this week when this cool converter came in. Wow. It’s a game changer. You can see in the pics it comes with the couple of basic Connectors you need and it can be Powered by 2 AA batteries or a USB 5 v power adaptor (I use my laptop’s USB). Even cooler, you just playback the cassette on the tape player, and connect a USB storage device, and that’s it!!! The software built into the device converts your playedback cassette music into MP3 files, which you can play back by simple connecting your USB where you stored the music to a playback source, i used my laptop as you see in the last picture. If you suffered through a pain in the rear cassette to mp3 converter and ended up giving up, give this little gizmo a try, you won’t regret it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point, I am going to say it&rsquo;s just okay until I find out whether or not my unit is performing normally.</p>

<p>Had to return because we received it broken. Play button did not work. Received full refund but chose not to replace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This piece of junk deserves no stars just based on the Instructions. Good lord, it would only cost $500 to hire someone who knows English. Horrid beyond belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handy-to-have">Handy to have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have tons of cassette tapes from my teen years. I am so excited to get them transferred so that I can get rid of the actual cassettes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-stay-quite">Must stay quite</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere in the description, I missed the part that says it may record background noises. You have to record in the play mode, so you have to be quite during playback.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-doesn-t-work">It doesn&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The play button doesn&rsquo;t stay pressed unless you keep holding it. Due to this, is completely useless.</p>
