<h5 id="excellent-for-skype-calls-durable-and-it-just-works">Excellent for Skype Calls - Durable, and It Just Works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to love Logitech products - you just plug them in and they work. I&rsquo;m using it on a laptop provided by a client for a project, with separate jacks for microphone and speaker. Rather than dink around with two devices, I got this. I use Skype to dial in to conference calls, as well as person to person calls, and this works perfectly. The mute and volume control appears durable and the cable and USB connector are substantial. The cable is a bit longer than I wanted, but I just use a Nite Ize gear tie to keep a few loops in a knotless sheepshank. If you have a dedicated Skype phone number, be sure to configure the ring to come through the speakers, rather than the headset.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="got-longer-use-out-of-it-than-i-ever-expected">Got longer use out of it than I ever expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this headset for almost a year now, and at first I thought that it was a good one just to start with because of its cheaper price range. I got it so I wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted much money if I didn&rsquo;t end up liking my new job that required its use. I teach online classes and this headset is great! Totally compatible with Adobe Classroom, which I use with Google Chrome. I&rsquo;ve never had any tech issues on my end with it, that&rsquo;s for sure. The sound cancellation isn&rsquo;t the best, but the headphones are cushiony enough that I have no problem wearing them for loooong stretches of time on my busy teaching days (yes, sometimes for about 8 hours total in a day). They don&rsquo;t make the arms of my glasses dig into the sensitive skin behind my ears, which was one of my biggest concerns initially. The cord is nice and long, so if I have to go get a new pen or something, I can discretely do it without taking my computer down accidentally. The mute button is my lifesaver! Students just think I have a really quiet house because they can&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s muted through the classroom controls. The button is the only thing that has worn down over the past year, but it&rsquo;s still fully functional. I just have to make sure I feel a little click when I push it and check to make sure the little indicator light is blinking so I know it really is muted before I go ahead and bite into a crunchy snack or take a loud slurp of coffee =P.</p>

<h5 id="the-fabric-wasn-t-rough-and-the-microphones-was-at-a-comfortable-distance-from-the-mouth-for-someone-to-still-drink">The fabric wasn&rsquo;t rough and the microphones was at a comfortable distance from the mouth for someone to still drink &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these headphones for my mother because she has ESL courses that she takes online that require these headphones. My mom is tiny (5&rdquo;) so I was curious if these were going to fit her little head and they did (they even fit my dad and he&rsquo;s a big guy 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;) and they did not bother her ears (she has sensitive skin). The fabric wasn&rsquo;t rough and the microphones was at a comfortable distance from the mouth for someone to still drink water from a water bottle. The installation was straightforward and not time consuming at all. My mom was happy with them so I&rsquo;m giving them a 5 star.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-audio-minor-comfort-issues">Good audio, minor comfort issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these for VOIP / Webex calling, so I tend to use them for hours at a time. The sound quality in the headphone is very good, although I think the sound levels are a little low - I would prefer the ability to get a little more volume. I&rsquo;m not hard of hearing, but my hearing is definitely not as good as it once was. This is a contributing factor.The audio on the other end of the call is also acceptable. The callers I have asked said it sounds a little more telephone like than my previous headset &ndash; but none have said the audio is bad, just that the sound is more &ldquo;mids&rdquo; and do not have as good of low end and high end clarity. Still perfectly acceptable &ndash; just different than what they had become accustomed to with my old set.The microphone boom is nice and tight &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t flop around. I like it a lot. The headset didn&rsquo;t come with a wind screen (the foam sock to go over the mic) which I thought was a little surprising.The earpads bit snugly. They articulate, but not quite as much as I would like. It took a little bit to get used to the way the pads set. Not uncomfrotable&hellip;again, just different.The one thing I DO NOT like is the pads feel warm &ndash; this will be nice in January but on an august afternoon, we&rsquo;ll see how &ldquo;hot ears&rdquo; feel. This &ldquo;hot ear&rdquo; is the only reason I didn&rsquo;t give 5 stars. We&rsquo;ll see how I get used to it &mdash; this may be something that becomes a non-issue in time.</p>

<h5 id="it-sounded-like-an-old-school-vinyl-record-if-you-put-your-finger">It sounded like an old-school vinyl record if you put your finger &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to use with my Macbook Air for dictation. I&rsquo;m a PA and I use dictation for my medical documentation. I got this headset in the hope that the higher quality mic would be more accurate that the internal mic that&rsquo;s built into my Macbook. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work at all. I tried it with my Dragon software and when I read the text to set the input settings, the playback sounded slow and massively distorted. It sounded like an old-school vinyl record if you put your finger on the record while it&rsquo;s playing to slow the playback. After the initializing process, I tried to dictate with it, and could see that the mic was picking up sound from the input volume icon, but it couldn&rsquo;t recognize any of the words. I thought maybe this was just with Dragon, so I tried it with the built in dictation software and it doesn&rsquo;t work with that either. I looked online for trouble shooting tips and discovered that this is a common issue with a lot of Logitech USB headsets and there&rsquo;s no solution for it. Very frustrating.</p>

<h5 id="painfully-tight-returning">Painfully tight, returning.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My trusty old Logitech G330 recently died after years of use so I needed a replacement that wasn&rsquo;t going to cost an arm and a leg. I&rsquo;m an adult woman and ideally I wanted a behind the head headset, but most of them are pricey and I do love my Logitech products so I thought I would give the H390 a try.I get migraines when I wear headsets too long, which can be as little as a few minutes, so the pressure this headset is causing right off the bat is concerning me. I&rsquo;ve expanded the headset to fit over my ears, but its putting pressure on my ears actually flattening them to my head as well which is causing my ears to hurt.I only actually needed the headset for the microphone, so I tried to just put it around my neck but the pressure at the base of my throat makes it feel like someone&rsquo;s choking me.Overall not a poor fit for me and is being returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lasted-only-6-months-i-need-warranty-replacement">Lasted only 6 months. I need warranty replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these 11/25/2016 and they are now not working correctly. When the cord is moved the sound goes in and out. I like the way they fit I just wish they lasted longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-with-zoom-and-go-to-meeting">Works great with Zoom and go-to meeting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wife needed for online masters classes. Works great with Zoom and go-to meeting. Cord was long which she also likes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-like-this-headset">I like this headset</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this headset, it is quite convenient especially if you are going to use it for online meetings or teaching online.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="only-headset-i-ll-buy-to-replace-the-previous-one">Only headset I&rsquo;ll buy to replace the previous one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are replacements for the exact same headset. Great sound and just works.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-needed-this-for-online-class-i-am-taking-but">I needed this for online class I am taking but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed this for online class I am taking but they seem to interact really weird with my macintosh. They adjust the volume constantly without me ever touching it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quit-working">Quit working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not finding how to contact seller. Use this for work and was okay for a week or so. Now customers hear me but I don&rsquo;t hear them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lasts forever</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality! Worth every penny! Fits great on my big head and feels good on my ears!</p>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-usb-headset-for-the-money">Excellent USB headset for the money</h5>

<p>This is an excellent headset. Actually, I just bought my second one. The first one cracked and became really loose as a result of carrying it in my computer backpack.</p>
