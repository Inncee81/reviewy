<p>Halo Protex Bandana is great for athletes that prefer bandanas but need the extra performance that a cotton bandana can&rsquo;t offer. Our bandanas feature our patented SweatBlock Technology to lead sweat away from your eyes and face so you can keep focused. The ability to tie the sweatband is a favorite among our customers who prefer a custom fit.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="terrific-skull-cap-made-in-usa-but-does-run-small">Terrific Skull Cap Made In USA But Does Run Small</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a few Halo Skull Caps and am pleased with the quality - As a person who is incredibly heat intolerant and sweats outside during the dog days of summer like a monsoon this particular cap made sense on multiple levels.* SPF factor of 50* Micro Mesh breathes and allows for evaporation and natural cooling* Sweat Diverter is patented by Halo and keeps perspiration out of your eyesI&rsquo;m not quite sure if I really like the rubber sweat diverter, I do prefer the Halo Protex Skull cap because it&rsquo;s larger and has ties which I like. These caps run very, very tight. But they&rsquo;re so light and airy you&rsquo;re used to the ultra snug fit in no time. As for the &ldquo;sweat diverter&rdquo; it might take some getting used to, but the rubber is extremely soft - however it still leaves a red mark on your forehead which takes a bit of time to disappear.Perfect for under a helmet, a bike ride, or hanging out on a hot day these really do perform as promised. They&rsquo;re made in the USA and the finishing and stitch quality are superb. They may cost more than others but those issues stated above make them worthwhile for me to pay a little more.The only complaint I have is once again the small size. I&rsquo;m a head shaver and this model is snug as in second skin snug, I&rsquo;m not sure how guys with hair would be able to wear these in complete comfort. That said due to their popularity it appears to be no problem whatsoever.Halo products are made from their Patented &ldquo;DRYLINE&rdquo; materials which in addition toantimicrobial and odor elimination properties is made of 63% Nylon 23% Polyester and 14% Lycra.Remember to only hand wash or machine wash on cool settings and never use the dryer, always air dry.</p>

<h5 id="fast-and-cool">Fast and Cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I FINALLY found the solution to my 4-wheeling needs! A helmet is sometimes too much and a hat is always a problem at more than 30 mph. I bought a leather bandana previously&hellip;&hellip;but it creeps up on the forehead and I am always having to adjust it. In the Florida heat&hellip;..it gets really HOT! Well&hellip;&hellip;.Halo has the ANSWER! This thing is GREAT! ZERO slippage or movement up to 70 mph so far. It is extremely comfortable and provides excellent sun protection. It stays very cool and honestly you forget you are wearing anything. I use this with my Guard Dog goggles&hellip;..and it is the PERFECT combo for riding! I HIGHLY recommend this bandana if you have the same needs I do or the same problems I did. This Halo is worth every single cent and I am going to order another one just to have it on hand. I bought the Camo and it looks great. Get you a Halo and be &ldquo;fast and cool&rdquo; like me&hellip;&hellip;.GT:)</p>

<h5 id="great-for-hot-day-motorcycle-rides">Great For Hot Day Motorcycle Rides</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wear do-rags while motorcycling and have for many years.This is the first mesh type do-rag I have tried. Once you get used to the light weight feel of the Halo it&rsquo;s actually nice. It&rsquo;s a lot lighter than the cotton do-rags.Here are a few things I really like about the Halo Headband:It has a sweat band in front.It has a rubber strip on the sweat band which is supposed to channel away sweat. I think it also sticks to my skin enough to prevent the Halo from flying off while riding.It fits snug and it&rsquo;s comfortable.The Halo Headband is made in the U.S.A.It&rsquo;s a cooler (temperature wise) alternative to the normal do-rags I wear.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-mountain-biking">Great For Mountain Biking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 3rd Halo head cover (2nd self tie adjust). First off the beanie cap model is adequate but i really enjoy the self tie in back as i can adjust the fit how i want and fact that i do ton of mountain biking and the knot helps keep it from riding down my forehead in front. The beanie does it slighly but just a discomfort more then an issue.Now I only wear these when i mountain bike (as i currently live/ride in jungle in singapore) so its very hot/humid and i sweat a ton as a result. This product works extremely well as advertised, especially for the sweatband protection. At least back in the states. I can do 3+ hour rides and get no sweat in the face. As for singapore i do eventually get sweat in eyes/face but not a fault to the headband. I sweat so much it saturates the headband, then the padding on interior of my helmet and this eventually allows a path that can/sometimes does drip into my face. Again though its no fault of the headband.As for other activities I have worn it through 2 tough mudders no problem. It stays tight on my head even during the leap of faith and other obstacles.</p>

<h5 id="great-while-it-lasted">Great while it lasted.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>lasted 2 years.The product itself is good, I hand wash it and unfortunately the yellow rubber &ldquo;sweat band&rdquo; portion has started to peel off.The manufacture has a 1 year product warranty. I might try some glue to reattach it.</p>

<h5 id="the-sweat-blocking-redirecting-strip-inside-this-thing-absolutely-works-like-you-would-not-imagine">The Sweat Blocking/Redirecting strip inside this thing absolutely works like you would not imagine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sweat Blocking/Redirecting strip inside this thing absolutely works like you would not imagine!!! I work in a steel forging shop. the steel is 2300 degrees and the shop is rarely under 100 degrees unless its snowing. i wear this under my hard hat, with safety glasses and it freaking works. the only down side(s) are these: its not fire resistant material so its technically not allowed where i work, and the material is fairly smooth and slippery and makes it somewhat tricky to keep my hard hat in the right position without over tightening it. I am about to buy a dozen more so I have them on hand as they wear out from daily washing. I have a large melon, 7 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> hat size and this fits fine&hellip; it would fit any smaller and would also fit up to a size 8 head too. I bought the beanie (no tie straps) and a couple head bands (velcro) and they were all way too small for me to put on, much less wear for a 10 hour work day. This fits fine and comfortable and even tho it does leave some marks along your head, its nothing more than any other do rag, bandanna, or cut up t-shirt rag would leave. one of the few products that performs as advertised and i highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Awesome these are my second pair. The first pair fell apart after 2 years of extensive use (mostly because I started to clean them in the washing machine, and not by hand)</p>
