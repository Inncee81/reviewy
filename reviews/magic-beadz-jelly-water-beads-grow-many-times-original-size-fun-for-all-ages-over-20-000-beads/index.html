</ul>

<p>Magic Beadz start as tiny hard balls but quickly grow many times their original size when you add water. This rainbow mix of water beads for kids will keep your children and their friends busy for hours. They make a fun game, great learning tool, science experiment, or sensory toy for toddler and preschool sensory tables, water play tables, or sensory bins. They are called by different names such as jelly beads, spa beads, gel balls, jelly water marbles, water jelly beadz, and sensory balls. They are also perfect budget-friendly Orbeez refills and can safely be used in all Orbeez products like the Crush and Soothing Spa. They make a great addition to Learning Resources toys like the helping hands fine motor tool set, handy scoopers, and science lab kit. Magic Beads are nontoxic, colorfast (won&rsquo;t fade or bleed), and non-flammable. Unlike similar polymer bead products, MagicBeadz have been fully tested and exceed all children&rsquo;s toy safety requirements. This is important due to the potential choking and ingestion hazards. Why put your children&rsquo;s health and safety at risk by purchasing cheap imitation gel beads that do not meet U.S. standards? These decorative beads absorb water to form colorful glass-like pearls that slowly release water back into their environment. They are made from a cross-linked super absorbent crystal polymer (sodium polyacrylate), originally developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to irrigate crops during drought. How many different ways can you use them?</p>

<h5 id="my-kids-had-a-lot-of-fun-with-them">My kids had a lot of fun with them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my daughters birthday. I wanted to fill a small pool with them so she could “swim” in them. Or at least be able to cover her legs. I used the whole jar. The jar is small but the beads are small until they absorb the water. So what I did was put the whole jar of beads into a 20 gallon tote. I added about 5 gallons of water. We were busy with birthday things so they ended up soaking for about 5 hours.(The package says 2-4 hours) The beads had absorbed most of the water and filled the tote about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the way. We used a strainer to take off the excess water.(there wasn’t much left) We had a 2 ring baby pool that was 4 feet wide. There was enough beads to just barely cover the bottom of the pool.The beads were bouncy and squishy and all very uniform. They held up very well. My kids had a lot of fun with them. With kids rolling around and playing in the pool with the beads we did end up with a smashed ones but that is to be expected when they are used the way we did. The kids sat on them. The kids did find about 6 odd shaped ones while they were playing. They made it a game and saved them because they were “cool”.Over all they worked Great. I would use them outside or inside but maybe the kitchen or bathroom. I think it would suck if these got smushed in the carpet. They are VERY bouncy. I would just call them mini bouncy balls, but bouncier… I am still finding get away beads around the house. If I were to do this again for the size of pool we had, I would get one more jar of the beads. My daughter is 12 so I think that would be plenty to fill the pool a bit more and still give her room without having a bunch spill out as she is playing. 3 jars might be too many.It has been 3 days and we are still trying to dry them out. It is still cold enough to snow here so drying them in the sun outside is kind of hard. We put them all back in the tote the 1st night because my daughter still wanted to mess with them. The next day we put a fan over the top of the tote and let it go for that day and most of the night. They did not shrink much so the past 2 days we have had them on a mesh drying rack I have for clothes. It has a fan connected to it. I covered the mesh with paper towels so that the beads would not fall though after they were back down to size. I shut it off at night and turn it on in the morning, but some of the beads are back down to their original size. I knew going in shrinking them back down would be the hard part so I am not surprised at this.Photos that I hope are in order :) :1. Tote and jar2. Dry beads in tote.3. Dry beads in hand4.

<h5 id="awesome-extremely-entertaining-for-kids">Awesome!! Extremely entertaining for kids!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast shipping, exactly as described. I set up a free kids activity at many local events. These water beads are by far the most popular thing I&rsquo;ve ever set up. Kids from 1-12 all love them. We put 1.5-2 containers worth in a kiddie pool with measuring cups, dinosaurs etc &amp; kids didn&rsquo;t want to leave. Highly recommend. We reused the same bunch 3 x. Non toxic and biodegradable are a huge plus. FUN!</p>

<h5 id="quality">Quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I went with these and I&rsquo;m glad I did. Only a few fall apart to the touch. Overall they were quality gel water balls. I made little batches to do discovery touch and feel games with my son. They are so relaxing I ended up playing with them way longer than him.I made the rest of the whole container at his birthday party and mixed in little Pokemon&rsquo;s for all the kids to find. Gotta catch em all! Pokemon find and trade game. It was a Huge hit! Everyone a blast. After the party favor game, the adults threw them around at everyone. And then somebody got the bucket dumped on them. We had a great time with these..well worth the money spent. I will definitely buy these again. The mess cleaned itself up too which as awesome! Five stars.</p>

<h5 id="better-than-expected">Better than expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When these first arrived, my thought was &ldquo;I paid $20 for this?!?&rdquo; The beads are BB sized and grow to small marble sized. The container is tiny, so 20000 didn&rsquo;t seem logical for such a small container. I grabbed a few out and put them in some water and a few hours later let my 3 year old toss them around in the empty bathtub. He had a ball! They were fun and bounced around like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe! I quickly changed by view of these not being worth the price as they are fun. They are durable but can and do break. We toss them in the garden when they do &amp; they serve a new purpose of aiding in plant root health. Well worth the price</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-neat-product-for-my-4-year-old">Really neat product for my 4 year old.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these for my 4 year old&rsquo;s birthday. They are pretty awesome! I cannot believe how much bigger they become- about the size of a marble. We put them in a large tub and let them soak up the water. When they were nice and plump, we drained out the water and he had SO much fun playing with them. He drove trucks through them, dumped them from one cup to another and hid things in them for us to find.On the flipside- my 22 month old twins also LOVE playing with them. They just get very wild while playing and unless we are watching them very closely, they will start &ldquo;splashing&rdquo; in the beads, sending them flying all over the place. Its not a huge deal when we are outside, but they do bounce and roll everywhere when they come out of the container. I also used these in my deck pots this year to help retain water so we don&rsquo;t have to water them so much.Overall, these beads are really neat, but are better for children who can sit and play quietly with them and understand to leave them in the container.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-kids-who-have-sensory-issues">Great for kids who have sensory issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My youngest who is 8 years old has a lot of issues with sensory. So we got him these magic beads &amp; he is in love with them! He plays with them all the time.. I would definitely recommend these to other people.. I&rsquo;ll admit to they are fun for even me to play in &amp; my other son who is 11 likes them too! Definitely worth the money plus you only have to use a small amount to get lots of beads.</p>
