<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="best-pick-has-the-features-that-are-most-useful-across-the-sonicare-line-without-costly-extras">Best pick! Has the features that are most useful across the Sonicare line, without costly extras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sonicare toothbrushes work very well. My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with a traditional toothbrush. I have some history using different models and think the Gum Health model is the right balance of features and cost.I had used the basic Elite series for a while, but the screw-in brushes got gross and smelly, so when the toothbrush died, I got the Flexcare. I liked the snap-on brush heads for the Flexcare brushes, as well as the slimmer, more elegant handle. While the Flexcare is a nice model and does a great job cleaning, I think it is too expensive and includes features I never used (and would bet most people don&rsquo;t use).When the Flexcare died (after 3 years and 4 months of use), I decided to go with the most basic Sonicare toothbrush that had the quadpacer and the snap-on brush head (the features I found helpful). At the time of this review, that ends up being the Gum Health Sonicare, which is $80 vs. the Flexcare at $130.So far, a couple months in, I&rsquo;m happy with the Gum Health toothbrush. It&rsquo;s not quite as sleek as the Flexcare (see photo with Gum Health on left and Flexcare on right), but given that I never used the advanced features of the Flexcare, I feel like I&rsquo;ve made a smarter purchase this time around (assuming it lasts for a few years).</p>

<h5 id="i-like-it-more-than-oral-b">I like it more than Oral-B</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My teeth collect a lot of tartar. I had periodontal surgery in the past, since then I get my teeth professionallly cleaned every 4 months. I&rsquo;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years. My most recent Oral B is similar to the current Pro 1000.At my last cleaning, my dental hygienist suggested I try Sonicare. She said some of her patients get better results with Oral B, others get better results with Sonicare, and she thought I was a good candidate for Sonicare. I&rsquo;ve had my Sonicare for 2 weeks and I love it.I read the review comparing Oral B and Sonicare at The Sweethome, which recommended the 2 Series, but I chose the 3 Series because of it&rsquo;s Li-Ion battery. Also the included Gum Health brush head matched my needs better than the Plaque Control head on the 2 Series.To me, it feels like the Sonicare is doing a better job than my old Oral B. After brushing, my mouth feels really clean, similar to the feeling I get after a professional cleaning at my dentist. Toothpaste stays on the head; the rotating brushes of the Oral B would throw off the toothpaste.Other things I like about the Sonicare are:1) The battery only takes a minute to recharge after brushing.2) The head, handle, and charger stay clean after use with just a light towelling off. My Oral B always collected a lot of gunk which would drip down to the charger.3) The charger is 110-240 Volts, so it is easier to use while travelling overseas.4) The included Gum Health head is small in size, and easy to get behind the rear molars and other tight places.5) I am hoping Sonicare&rsquo;s Li Ion battery lasts longer than my Oral B batteries. I had to replace my Oral B toothbrushes every couple of years due to battery failure.Things I don&rsquo;t like about the Sonicare are:1) If your teeth come in contact with the plastic part of the head, the vibration of the plastic against your teeth is quite unpleasant.2) The Sonicare makes me salivate more while brushing than the Oral B.3) If I remove the brush from my mouth while it is powered on, there is a large amount of saliva sprayed for a large distance. I&rsquo;ve gotten used to turning it off before removal.4) I don&rsquo;t use the 3 intensity levels feature (I keep it on maximum intensity), and it is easy to accidently change the intensity if you rapidly turn the toothbrush on and off. I would have preferred to not have this feature as on the 2 Series.5) The names of the different models are very confusing. Most are named according to the included head. However, any of the latest model Sonicare heads will fit any of their latest model toothbrushes. You need to refer to the comparison chart on Amazon or the manufacturer&rsquo;s web site to see the differences between the models.Ater two weeks of use, I would definitely recommend Sonicare over Oral B. I&rsquo;ll update this review after my next visit to the dentist and report if the hygienist thinks my teeth are any cleaner.</p>

<h5 id="takes-some-getting-used-too-but-worth-it">Takes some getting used too&hellip;.but worth it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an upgrade from my old Oral-B electric toothbrush. Out of the box, i was surprised how small the brush head was, and how little toothpaste i could get on it.Those concerns were immediately alleviated the instant i turned it on in my mouth and watch a spray of foam fly everywhere, much to my dog&rsquo;s delight. My dog isn&rsquo;t smart, so things that fly around can keep him entertained for hours on end. I envy his simple-mindedness.This brush is so much more powerful, yet still far easier on my gums that any other electric toothbrush i&rsquo;ve ever tried. The paste foams up and spreads quickly, plaque is removed from teeth and gums instantly, the pulsing timer is handy for knowing when to work on different areas of the mouth. All in all, a great product that i&rsquo;m happy to now own!</p>

<h5 id="good-value">Good value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously had the Flex Care, and used the sensitive setting all the time. When I got this toothbrush, I use the maximum setting. There aren&rsquo;t as many features, but this is less than half the price. The feature I miss most was the battery light indicating how much battery was left. But for the price difference, I don&rsquo;t really care that much. One benefit for this model is it lasts me 3 weeks per charge, not 2 weeks like the Flex Care did.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-buy-with-the-frequently-bought-together-heads-the-heads-are-very-different">If you buy with the &ldquo;frequently bought together heads&rdquo; the heads are very different!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had several Sonicare toothbrushes. This is by far my favorite. I really love the toothbrush head. It is compact and it seemed to do a better job than some of the others. The toothbrush has three intensities and the quadrapacer. I also like the more compact design and the travel case. WARNING, if you buy it with the &ldquo;frequently bought together&rdquo; brush heads, they are nothing like the gum care toothbrush head. I will not return them, but I went back and ordered original Sonicare heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bought-this-because-my-dentist-recommend-me-to-try-an-electric-tooth-brush">Bought this because my dentist recommend me to try an electric tooth brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this because my dentist recommend me to try an electric tooth brush, since I was stress brushing my gums and teeth out of my mouth. So far I like that it has a low setting to start with to get you use to an electric tooth brush. I also like the fact it has a slight beep like sound when it is time to switch to another section of teeth. My teeth seem to be clean a little better than when I was brushing my self. Will have to wait for the six month review when I go back to the dentist to see how my gums are doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointing-budget-sonicare">Disappointing budget Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Vibrates much more loudly than other Sonicare handles we&rsquo;ve had, while also not vibrating as strongly at it&rsquo;s top setting. Most annoying is the combo button that adjusts the speed as well as turning it on and off; leading to times when you mean to turn it off, but then need to wait longer before you can turn it off, and then also need change the speed again at some point. If you&rsquo;re looking for a simple no-fuss Sonicare, you may want to stick with the Easy Clean until the newer <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> Series brushes get the kinks worked out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="for-once-the-upgrade-is-worth-it">For once the upgrade is worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ended up liking this better than I thought I would. I had to bite the bullet on the price because I always use the timer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Always liked Philips Sonicare!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cleanest-gums-in-town">Cleanest gums in town!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon the advice of my periodontist, I purchased this model. Although it takes a little getting used to, the timing feature is a great reminder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="make-your-dental-hyegnist-happy">make your dental hyegnist happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 5th Sonicare brush, and every one is better than than ever. Has adjusting speeds and times. Love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-buy">Must buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this toothbrush. The charge last longer then other brands and the replacement heads are cheaper and easier to install</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great toothbrush! Excellent to take on trips. Fits easily into my travel bag. Battery life is excellent. Would highly recommend</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gift">Great Gift</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my brother for his birthday. He really likes it. I was recommended by one of my dentist friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-brush">Good brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had to toss my other battery sonics. They just fell apart and sounded like jackhammers. So far this one is great.Quiet and works great. The brush cleans well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-advertised">As Advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. This product is exactly as advertised. I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t purchase it sooner. I have to be careful to not brush too long, as I have very sensitive gums.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-dependable">Not Dependable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to be a cheap version. Brush no longer charges. Useless. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in the different level either. I wish I had better things to say.</p>
