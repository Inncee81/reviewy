<h5 id="multi-use-soundbar">Multi use soundbar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this soundbar during amazon prime day and got a great deal.I had 3 major criterias for a soundbar:1) better than my 65&rdquo; TV speakers. Checked2) Bluetooth and optical input (only options for my TV). Checked3) I did not want something overwhelming loud like a commercial theater. The size and loudness had to be civilized. CheckedBonus: It can also be used as a stand alone sound system to listen to music wirelessly (bluetooth) from a phone or tablet.</p>

<h5 id="buy-it">Buy it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this, I&rsquo;ve been looking at sound bars for a while now but really did not want to spend a small fortune. We have this set up in our living room which isn&rsquo;t huge but decent size and the sound is amazing. The bass on it is great, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect with just one bar but it covers space well! My favorite part is the sound clarity. With kids watching action movies or scary movies there are always the loud part when all you hear is the noise and have to turn it way up just to hear the voices. This makes a huge difference and you can hear the voices so so much better! I will highly recommend and if I ever get another sound bar this will be it!!!</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-value">Fantastic value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No idea why the refurbished version is half the price of the non-refurbished version, but this is an absolute steal. The sound quality outclasses any soundbar I&rsquo;ve heard in the ~$100 range. My old budget Vizio soundbar that cost $80 on sale doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to this.At first, I thought the refurbished soundbar was dead on arrival, but it turns out the included batteries for the remote were dead, which is odd, because I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever received included batteries that were just completely dead before for any other purchase I&rsquo;ve made, but that was a simple fix as I have lots of AAAs lying around (my old Vizio uses the same batteries, and those batteries are still going strong after 4 years).And, unlike some soundbars (*cough*my old vizio<em>cough</em>), this one also has physical buttons on the soundbar itself in case you lose your remote or have no batteries (that&rsquo;s how I realized the included batteries were dead).It looks brand new with all the annoying clear decals to peel off and everything.As long as there isn&rsquo;t some known defect that&rsquo;s going to cause this thing to self destruct within a year, this is a huge steal at its current price.</p>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">Good For the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be a little critical in this review, so let me state right up front for the cost, this is a very good sound bar, and worth the money, if it fits your needs.I purchased this unit almost on accident, looking to order a more robust unit, but gave it a go anyway. Here are some key things to know.â€¢ The unit was super simple to install, and get going. I only glanced at the instructions. The remote is also easy to figure out. The app downloaded fine on my iPhone, and was a little more complicated, but worked as well.â€¢ This is not the same as a full surround system. Not even close. Even it&rsquo;s &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; surround feature is just a little more stereo imagery than regular &ldquo;stereo&rdquo; setting. If you want full surround, buy a surround system.â€¢ The bass on this system is okay. Not closed to a subwoofer at all, but not thin either. Just average I&rsquo;d say. But for being just a bar, that&rsquo;s not bad.â€¢ The Clear Voice feature is slightly noticeable. After all the stellar reviews on it, perhaps my expectations were too high.â€¢ I own a Sony Brava top of the line TV from a couple years back with good stereo speakers built in. I was expecting this sound bar to be significantly better after all the reviews on how this blows away TV speakers, but it was not. It was only slightly better. If you own an average TV, this bar will probably be a noticeable improvement. On a TV with high quality speakers, probably not. Go for something bigger.â€¢ The volume on this bar was able to get louder than my Sony TV. But I have a fairly small living room, where that wasn&rsquo;t necessary most of the time.All in all, I&rsquo;d say for the money this is a good buy if you just need a decent bar. However, if you are like me and looking for a really good sound system, you&rsquo;re going to need a higher end bar, plus a sub woofer, or a full surround system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An excellent sound bar that is beautiful in design and produces better than expected sound. This doesn&rsquo;t come close to producing a cinematic quality sound and won&rsquo;t replace a good 2.1, 5.1, or 7.1 sound system but what it does do it does well.So what does it do?1. It beats the pants of any stock TV speakers.2. The &ldquo;clear voice&rdquo; option allows for listening at lowered volumes and still clearly understanding every word. This is especially handy if you have a napping baby in the house.3. It saves tons of space over most alternatives and can even be wall mounted!4. It produces good sound for most music and general TV.The downside?1. It doesn&rsquo;t have thumping bass. This was not an issue for me but I know is for some.2. Not really good for movies but is not that horrible either. In other words one might say if space or budget are issues then it meets minimal sound standards and will due but will not give you mind blowing sound.3. Adds an additional remote to the mix that will only have some limited functionality with a universal remote.Overall impression: I&rsquo;d buy it again and I definitely recommend if you feel the positives I&rsquo;ve listed out way the negative.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-at-a-great-price">Great sound at a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure what was done to refurbish the unit since it looks brand new. Sound is great and hookup was extremely easy but remember to mute your TV or it won&rsquo;t work. Great and clear instructions in owner&rsquo;s manual. Surround sound is very good especially considering it&rsquo;s from a bar in front of you. A full blown 5 speaker sound system it&rsquo;s not but it does give you a full sound that really enhances action movies. Voices are super clear in movies as well as news and talk shows and regular programming. I may try hooking up my old powered sub woofer for some extra deep base but as it is it&rsquo;s just fine.</p>
