<h5 id="good-value">Good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this today and installed it and it seems to be working great. I ended up hard wiring it to a fuse tap on my jeep, and used the circuit board from inside the cigarette lighter since it drops 12v to 5v. Works great, turns on with ignition, and shuts down after. Video quality is good as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera-in-this-price-range">Great camera in this price range</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I have been using this camera for about 2 months now and I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it. It performs much better than I would assume a camera in this price range would perform. I don&rsquo;t use parking mode so I can&rsquo;t say how that performs. What I do like is that is once you have decided on settings it works flawlessly. I bought a hardwire kit but it is currently hooked up to my cigarette lighter which operates with the ignition. It is mounted behind the rear view mirror on my primary and secondary vehicles and are not visible from the drivers view.Pros:It starts recording within 5 seconds of powering on.Has a great picture both day and night for something in its price range.Comes with 2 mounting shoes that use black double sided tape.It has either a battery or capacitor and will continue to record for the amount of time you specify after power is removed.You can press the red button to save whatever it is currently recording.Has a G-Sensor (I&rsquo;ve yet to test it and hopefully don&rsquo;t have to)Great field of viewIt is tiny.Cons:While it is pretty clear, it does tend to get grainy at night.It picks up a lot of glare from the dashboard. While this isn&rsquo;t necessarily the fault of the camera it would be nice if it included a polarizing filter or had a way to attach one like many other models have. (No stars were removed for this)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera-mounting-system-not-so-much">Great camera. Mounting system, not so much.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, I love the camera, but the windshield mount can&rsquo;t take the heat. Granted, while the Arizona desert is considered an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; environment, still, one must take into consideration the effect of a somewhat weighty object mounted to one&rsquo;s windshield with double-sided tape under such conditions. It probably sticks fine under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions&hellip; ELSEWHERE, but not here. Anyway, I just ordered a rearview-mirror dashcam mount that appears to (by the reviews I read) solve the problem. I&rsquo;m looking forward to putting it to the test when it arrives. For anyone interested, it&rsquo;s this one:<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0102CK1BS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0102CK1BS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>

<h5 id="good-camera-and-great-customer-service">Good camera and great customer service!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera itself compact and does the job.The power cord it came with was dead on arrival, but seller got in contact with me and offered refund/replacement for power cord. Looks like although parts can sometimes be faulty, they make up for it with great customer service, which is very appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-value-for-the-price">Excellent value for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Small and unobtrusive, almost hidden behind the rear view mirror, this dash cam takes clear, wide angled high def pictures. Following the user guide&rsquo;s instructions, it was easy to set up and customize to the way I wanted it to operate. The SUV&rsquo;s nav system made in integrated GPS unnecessary. Access to the SD card to review or archive trip recordings is easy (but a challenge for big fingers). Moving the rear view mirror out of the way makes access to the function buttons easy to see and use. The mounting tape provided for the camera mount and cable cover was very good. The camera is easy to remove should the need occur. It was easy to obtain an optimal picture-taking angle with the adjustable lens housing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-basic-dash-cam">Great basic dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a no frills dash cam that can be easily hidden, look no further. I&rsquo;ve had this in my car for more than a year now and it seems to be working well. It&rsquo;s very discreet, you really don&rsquo;t notice it&rsquo;s even there. There&rsquo;s no annoying flashing lights or sounds (except the sound to let you know it&rsquo;s on/off).I hardwired it into my car, but it comes with a cigarette lighter plug as well if you don&rsquo;t want to wire it in. The quality isn&rsquo;t amazing, you most likely won&rsquo;t be able to read license plates that are far away or dimly lit, but it&rsquo;s more than enough for proving fault. If you wan&rsquo;t those capabilities, you might want to spend a bit more for a 1440p one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price-but-not-great">Great for the price but not great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This work adequately and more or less as expected. In the day time, I can sometimes get a plate from a passing car. If they are too far or in shadow they are too blurry to read. It has a nice wide view that picks up a lot of what goes on in front of the car. I have it hard wired so it stays on all the time so it can pick up parking lot mishaps and suchand it does not seem to drain the battery in any noticeable way. I wish I had chosen the one with a rear camera so I&rsquo;m thinking of getting that one too and moving this one to the other car. If the sun is brought out can wash the picture out or if it&rsquo;s dark the picture get grainy. It remained stuck to the glass all summer, no problem. Given the price I love it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: Been using this a year and it&rsquo;s still fantastic. I verified the g-sensor works great because it automatically stored a 5 minute block when ice flew off my hood and hit the windshield.So far this thing is great. Video quality is great and build quality is great. Menu is a little cumbersome but you get used to it. I hardwired it with the spy tech harness. My cigarette lighter stays on so the auto on feature would not have worked as intended&hellip; I wanted it hard wired anyway though.</p>
