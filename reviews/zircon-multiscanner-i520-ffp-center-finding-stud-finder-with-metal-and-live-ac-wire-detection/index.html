<p>Product Packaging:Frustration-Free Packaging
The multiscanner I520 is one of the most advanced wall scanners and stud finders that Zircon makes. It has 4 scanning modes: 1. Stud scan mode locates the edges and center of wood or metal studs in normal walls up to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch (19 mm) deep 2. Deepscan mode doubles the scanning depth for walls up to 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches (38 mm) deep, and enables scanning for joists in some ceilings and floors 3. Metal scan mode detects non-ferrous metal, such as copper pipes, up to 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches (38 mm) deep, and ferrous metal, such as rebar, up to 3 inches (76 mm) deep 4. AC scan mode finds and traces live, unshielded electrical wiring up to two inches deep in addition to the scanning modes, the I520 is packed with other original and patented features including: 1. Wirewarning detection which indicates the presence of live, unshielded electrical wire up to 2 inches (51 mm) deep in stud and metal scanning modes. Most wires in homes are run along wall studs, causing potential safety hazards. 2. Act (auto correcting technology) automatically corrects common user errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud. The tool constantly scans its surroundings and recalibrates itself if necessary. 3. An ultra-bright LCD screen indicates direction, edges and center of studs. Makes the screen easier to see in low-light the display screen, spotlite pointing system, and audio tone all indicate the location of the target. 4. A signal strength indicator lets you distinguish between Shallow and deep targets. Weak signal strength can also imply other non-stud objects, like wires and pipes. The I520 is a perfect choice for serious users, such as home improvement hobbyists and professional contractors.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="amazing-product">Amazing Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a awesome product, how I lived without it for so long. This device is right on the money I needed to figure out how these conduit lines were running in a wall. This was spot on showing me the bends and turns I did not have to rip up all of the wall to find. I don&rsquo;t have to bring my meter to check for live A/C on a outlet I just use my Zircon Meter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-stud-finder-and-this-zircon-is-definitely-much-better-the-signal-strength-indicator-helped-me-a-lot">&hellip; a stud finder and this Zircon is definitely much better. The signal strength indicator helped me a lot &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I previously had a cheapo version of a stud finder and this Zircon is definitely much better. The signal strength indicator helped me a lot to figure out what was behind the wall as I was getting some weird readings with the old cheapo detector and could not figure out where the studs were. Knowing where the edges are was the reason I bought this one finder. I was able to cut the holes that I needed and it was accurate. The AC line detector is a plus and it warned me about some areas I had to be careful with. Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="finds-studs">Finds studs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This device finds studs and electrical wires and wasn&rsquo;t too expensive.I haven&rsquo;t found any inconsistencies, it&rsquo;s been dead on when compared to measuring 16&rdquo; between studs. Sometimes if you start measuring from on top of a stud it gets confused, but it&rsquo;s pretty clear when that happens. Just make sure to take a few readings from a few different places, I&rsquo;ve found it very consistent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-what-it-says">Does what it says</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This i520 works as advertised in my experience. Accurately detects studs in normal walls with ease. It does not do so well on some of my walls which are made of plaster and lathing. I doubt much of anything would do extremely well on those type of walls.One aspect of performance that I was looking for and did not find about this i520 was how it does on the electrical and metal detection. It seems it works as advertised in these areas but I was hoping for a little more depth when detecting electrical. I think the instructions say it can detect up to 1.5 inches in depth and it will definitely not give you any more than that. I guess that is typically a safe depth when driving nails and screws but don&rsquo;t expect to be able to trace your wires throughout your walls. It did come it handy for checking if exposed wires were live or not without pulling out the multimeter.Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I put up the extra cost for this model.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-wall-scanner">Great wall scanner</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first purchase from Amazon Warehouse and it went great. The item was like new and it worked great right out of the packaging. I used this to install a very heavy duty plasma tv wall mount and it was the first time I used an electric wall scanner. I grew up with a spinning magnet in a plastic box but after using the Zircon Multiscanner, I can&rsquo;t imagine using anything else. It made it so easy to find the center of a stud, electrical wiring and more. I feel the extra money for this model versus scanners that don&rsquo;t show the center of the stud makes it worth it. It even helped me locate studs that were doubled up inside the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-warns-you-for-any-electrical-wiring-that-may-be-behind-the-wall-as-well-which-is-a-great-safety-feature">it warns you for any electrical wiring that may be behind the wall as well which is a great safety feature</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this to mount a tire rack on the wall above the door. Finding the studs was very convenient with this item, it warns you for any electrical wiring that may be behind the wall as well which is a great safety feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-but-battery-issues">Ok, but&hellip; Battery Issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was disappointed to get this, realize it needed a 9-volt battery, and that one was not included. Compounding that was the fact that, be careful, this unit is very battery-picky. I put a brand new Everyready battery in it and the device didn&rsquo;t work. After contacting tech support they said it needs a <em>really</em> brand new battery, say a Duracell with 2017 or later life on it. Well, I went and bought one of those and it did work. I wonder how long it will last.So, the unit seems to work nicely and customer support was responsive, but the battery thing is something you may want to be aware of&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-i-have-been-using-this-device-over">It Works! I have been using this device over &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It Works! I have been using this device over the last several weeks to find studs for hanging TVs, gym equipment, and other types of wall mounts. It even warns you if there are nails or other metal obstructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-stud-finder">Good stud finder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stud finder works perfectly, cable/electricity finder seems a little inaccurate but good enough for home DIY</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this all the time before mounting anything on a wall. Being able to differentiate between a wood and metal stud makes a huge difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="garbage">Garbage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own a construction company. This is a Defective item. Just goes beep beep beep no matter what. I don&rsquo;t have time to mess around with returning because It isn&rsquo;t worth that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Slightly over complicated and don&rsquo;t trust the &ldquo;AC&rdquo; function, but I didn&rsquo;t buy it for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-was-very-pleased-with-how-effective-this-scanner-was-in-detecting-the">I was very pleased with how effective this scanner was in detecting the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving the scanner, I tested it by placing a spare sheet of 10mm drywall over a stud, ac cables and metal bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No Issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="used-better-used-worse">Used better, used worse&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to locate studs through double layer of <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> rock. Even in deep scan mode. Running base trim you kind of have to hold the finder upside down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great tool and prompt delivery!</p>
