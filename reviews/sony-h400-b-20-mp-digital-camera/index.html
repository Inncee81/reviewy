<p>From the Manufacturer</p>

Use Easy Mode to simplify the camera’s menu functions, plus add fun or dramatic looks with the built-in Picture Effects. It’s ready when you are.</p>

<p>Get everything up close with powerful 63x Optical Zoom

<p>Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and stills
Shoot incredibly smooth video1 and still images with Optical SteadyShot Image Stabilization with Active mode. This technology works to deliver sharp image quality with low noise and minimal blur even while the user is strolling and the camera is zoomed in.</p>

<p>20.1MP Super HAD CCD sensor for beautifully detailed images
A powerful 20.1 megapixel super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail.</p>

<p>Picture Effect for more expressive photos
Picture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Picture Effect can be applied to still images (4 modes), movies (4 modes) and panoramic shots (3 modes), giving photos and movies even greater impact.</p>

<p>Sweep Panorama mode (up to 360°)
Reach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360° full circle, the camera can take a variety of panoramic shots. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.</p>

<p>Smile Shutter technology automatically captures smiles

You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.</p>

<p>Shoot in challenging lighting situations with Party Mode

<p>3.0” (921K dots) Clear Photo LCD display
Generous 3.0” (921K dots) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight.</p>

<h5 id="not-bad-for-the-price">Not bad for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like it! As a disclaimer I still have a lot to learn when it comes to photography! I have only been shooting in Auto mode so far. I was looking to replace my old Cybershot that I believe was 10.1 MP &amp; had around 20x zoom (can&rsquo;t find the model for the life of me). It also had the Carl Zeiss lens. It seems this camera&rsquo;s dynamic range is different, so if you are very picky about your dynamic range the hx400 may be worth the upgrade. However, for my purposes: a birthday present to myself with which I can take pictures of birds, it works great!Some people are complaining about the lack of &lsquo;auto-focus&rsquo; but I rather enjoy the fun of pressing the button half-way, trying to get the focus just right and then snapping the picture. It may take some getting used to but I think I would prefer telling it when to adjust the focus to the subject than it auto-focusing wherever it pleases. There is a slight &lsquo;lag&rsquo; when taking the photo but it doesn&rsquo;t seem very significant. Someone said 1-2 seconds. It&rsquo;s more like 200ms. Again, I just consider it a fun handicap. The panorama function is very fun and the included strap feels nice and sturdy.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-amazing-camera-for-the-price">Pretty Amazing Camera for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After schlepping around Europe and losing my interchangeable Alpha Sony in a German airport I just bought this camera for a travel option. The 63x zoom sold me. My husband and I have always traveled with multiple lens cameras and thought we might simplify our lives. This sony has a great feel, not exactly compact, so simple to use and the zoom is incredible. We are impressed with the clarity and image detail-THE ZOOM! The negatives are no manual focus, no remote, wifi or GPS but for the price we can do without. This will probably be the camera we grab first in our bag of of DSLRs.Two months later&hellip;.After using this for a while I have a lot of peeves. The color is pretty bad. The A for aperture setting that is my favorite portrait setting is simply a black fuzzy frame around subject. The focus can be exasperating but for birds and mountain peaks I still love it.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-a-big-sony-camera-fan-but-this-model-disappoints">I am a big Sony Camera fan, but this model disappoints.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I should have heeded the negative reviews of the model camera, but I was soooo looking forward to the big optical zoom of this camera as well as the fact that this a 20 megapixel camera, too, plus it has a large LCD screen and viewfinder for those times when yoy can&rsquo;t see the LCD screen in bright light.But the operation of this camera is ridiculous.And I can&rsquo;t beleive all of the better and glowing reviews of this Sony H400.This Sony camera model disappoints on soooo many levels.First, Screw the users who bought this camera and are telling people that you shouldn&rsquo;t use the full auto shoot mode and learn to use this camera manually to get, sorta past, this cameras big shortcomings.Really???&hellip;When I buy a what I perceive to be a good quality point and shoot camera with full auto shooting features, I expect it to perform fantanstic when using this mode.I may explore the manual photo taking features later as I get used to the camera and all of its feature set, but initially, for awhile, I expect flawless performance of auto shooting camera that touts great peformance and pictures using auto mode!This camera has some sort of issue as the delay in pressing the shutter button and when the shutter actually responds is a good second, maybe two, before the picture is taken.It&rsquo;s a very noticeable lag and I feel this is unacceptable from any good digital camera and very surprised to see this defect in a brand, like Sony.I actually have the hold the camera steady for an additional second or two AFTER I have already pushed the shutter button?I own three Sony digital cameras and one Nikon digital and there is no such shutter lag in Auto mode in any of those cameras.There goes trying to capture ANYTHING that is moving. I would need to try and anticipate when a moving object will reach the camera lens and try to time it so the shot gets taken within that two second delay of pushing the shutter button.Also, both the Electronic viewfinder, as well as the LCD screen are NOT very crisp and clear.The LCD screen ( compared to my other cameras) is very coarse and grainy looking and make it hard to see if the image yoy took is really a good image or not.The color of the images, overall, is good, but still not what I expect from a Sony product and from a company whose products are design for capturing the best images possible in all pricing levels.Also, I tried taking videos (which I realised, that the audio being recorded is only in Monoaural sound and not stereo.And, the video I took which were being taken in good bright sunlight exhibited some strange vertical color streaking/banding effects like either the lens (which is NOT a Carl Zeiss lens I have come to, automatically, expect in their higher priced camera lineups, but a Sony designed lens) couldn&rsquo;t handle the strong sunlight or the Super HAD CCD chip on the backside of the lens was not capable of dealing with the strong sunlight.I have an older, but higher end Sony digital camera and a newer Nikon Bridge camera that take 720p video and neither exhibited this vertical banding/striping/streaking while video-ing a bright sunlight.The video capture of this Sony H400 just couldn&rsquo;t do a video without introducing some weird light artifacts/abborations.It could be either a limitation of the lens or the lower end CCD where newer digital cameras use the more commonly found digital CMOS chips for capturing light.I bought this used, but still paid close to $200.So disappointed and really so unimpressed and upset that Sony created and sells this sub par camera.I will be returning this very soon and pay a little more for something better.Stay away from both the H300 and H400 Sony camera models.I think I am going to spend a little more on Sony&rsquo;s HX camera models, instead or look at other slightly more expensive Nikon models.The Sony HX camera models look to be what the H models should have been.</p>

<h5 id="good-purchase">Good purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first received this camera I almost sent it back. Then I decided to put it to the test just to see what it could accomplish. I am glad I kept this camera. The color renditions are spot on. You have to learn not to go too deep into the zoom, because the 20+ megapixel processor lets you crop your images and get a closer shot without loss of clarity. Kind of disappointed that it has not got a dedicated macro mode, but being able to get clear focus at just a few inches makes up for it. All around good bridge camera. I would have given it a five star if it were not for the LCD screen being too bright no matter what setting you put it on. That&rsquo;s why I almost sent it back. I learned that a refocus of the shot helps this problem, but sometimes to get a good shot you do not always have time to refocus. Still I am pretty impressed with this camera. Think its a good purchase.</p>

<h5 id="bday-gift-to-myself">bday gift to myself!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love this camera! It&rsquo;s a DLSR type camera that has 720p HD recording and a whopping 20MP!!! and a crazy 60 zoom lens that is amazing! I travel alot and this does both the photo and recording needs I have. A great combo buy in one camera! easy to setup, download the software for your pc or laptop and pretty eassy to use as well. suggested for anyone who loves taking pictures or travels alot or a little looking to have a great camera and camcorder all-in-one! does both very well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-a-great-camera-overall">its a great camera overall</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, its a great camera overall. only issue is it was difficult to focus on distant objects. so sad to say I returned the item. Also wish the back display would tilt. Having a fixed display makes it difficult to put the camera at different heights.Took awesome photos of the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-very-pleased-with-the-camera">I&rsquo;m very pleased with the camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, I&rsquo;m very pleased with the camera. It seems to eat batteries a little quickly, especially if you use the screen to review pictures and the 63X zoom will take some getting used to but the camera does an excellent job producing beautiful photos. This camera is for my wife, most commonly referred to as the phantom flasher because she is always taking pictures. She has fallen in love with it.</p>
