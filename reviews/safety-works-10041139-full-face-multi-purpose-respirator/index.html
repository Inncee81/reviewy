<blockquote>
<p>This mask showed up as I was in the middle of scrapping and sanding window frames. I was able to directly compare it to a similar 3M respirator which I&rsquo;ve been using for 10 years. The MSA mask fits better and is more comfortable. I used it for over 2 hours and didn&rsquo;t need to adjust the fit during the job as with the 3M unit. It&rsquo;s light weight and has has a superior field of vision. I later tried it while using some harsh solvent while preparing surfaces to be glued. It did both jobs with flying colors. No hint at all of sanding dust or chemical odor inside the mask.UPDATE: I&rsquo;ve been using it for 10+ hours now. I&rsquo;m happy to report that it remains comfortable and highly effective. No aches or jaw fatigue after wearing it even with the straps pulled up a couple notches tighter than I could tolerate on the 3M mask. It keeps out everything: dust, chemicals, and faint odors wafting in on the breezes.No mention of size in the description, it&rsquo;s a medium. It comes with a nice storage case and a bracket to hang the case on a wall.Further opinions: Half mask respirators are for the birds when you&rsquo;re dealing with dust. For me any job that rates a respirator rates a full face respirator. I bought the previously mentioned 3M full mask for a nasty overhead scrapping and sanding job. I began this project using an industrial quality half face respirator and safety glasses. I couldn&rsquo;t make good time on this job because I had to stop frequently to clean or defog the safety glasses, not to mention my eyes getting irritated by fine dust that got around the glasses. After buying at first full face mask I was amazed to find that my productivity doubled. Besides eliminating many stops to clean the safety glasses I was also willing to get directly underneath of my work as opposed to previously working from off to the side. The half mask hasn&rsquo;t been out of its box since.</p>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re working in environments immediately hazardous to life, this respirator is the one to get. Don&rsquo;t get it from anywhere else either, this is the best deal you&rsquo;re going to find. I saw no mention of this, but it comes with a hard plastic storage case that is practically airtight (im sure it doent take pressure but whatever). It also comes with two GME-P100 cartridges. If you buy this anywhere else they&rsquo;re more than likely going to break this up and sell you just the mask for 150-160. I wound up buying cartridges anyway, because I didnt know about this, but it never hurts to have extras.Highlights:Silicone facepiece instantly conforms to face.Nose/mouth guard prevents almost all mask-fog associated with full-face respiratorsExcellent seal with very minimal adjustment (provided no facial hair)Straps have very intelligent adjustment systems that allow for a consistent fit.That said, you never get rid of condensation, we are water based beings, after all. Expect some fog/condensation even if you&rsquo;re wearing this mask in a air conditioned room at 65 degrees. Still one of the best out there. Some full face-masks don&rsquo;t fit well enough to justify shaving, but this one certainly does. The size seems to be a large, and it seems like it would fit people of different ethnicities very well.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-fit-coverage-and-comfort">Excellent fit, coverage, and comfort.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wearing full face respirators for 13 years, mostly 3M, but also North. As nice as the 3M respirators are, they tend to only last me about one year before a strap breaks. Depending on what part breaks, this can be rectified with a replacement part, but it&rsquo;s still inconvenient and annoying. When my last 3M mask strap assembly broke, only after about 5 months wear, I thought maybe I&rsquo;d try something new.The MSA Safety Works respirator came in just a few days ago, but I&rsquo;m pretty excited about this mask. Upon unpacking, my first reaction was that it didn&rsquo;t quite seem as nicely made as the 3M masks. It doesn&rsquo;t feel cheap, mind you, but it doesn&rsquo;t quite have the same feeling/appearance of quality that the nicer 3M models have. I was very impressed with the included carrying case and wall mount (although it would be much better if you didn&rsquo;t have to remove the cartridges from the mask before putting it in the case).I was very pleasantly surprised, however, with the fit and comfort of this mask. I have sort of a small face I guess, because I sometimes have a hard time getting a good seal on other respirators (I normally wear a small or medium mask). This one size fits all mask had me a little concerned about fitment, but the seal is great. So, too, is the comfort. Definitely the most comfortable full face respirator I&rsquo;ve owned.Time will tell how well this one holds up. Hopefully I can make it a couple years without a strap breaking. So far I&rsquo;m very happy with this purchase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great respirator. I use it for lacquer spraying and dusty construction projects. Also use when crawling under crawl spaces in questionable condition. I was worried about fogging on the interior of the mask due to the extreme temperature difference where I live, but it seems they&rsquo;ve designed this mask with great airflow around the nose mask. Product comes in nice carrying case and seems to be very well put together. So far after two years it&rsquo;s showing very little signs of wear. Great product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this MSA full face respirator for airbrushing Cerakote on my gun parts. It protects me from chemicals that I don&rsquo;t want in my lungs or eyes. It doesn&rsquo;t fog up. The areas that touch your face are soft enough to make an air tight seal across my glasses earpieces. Be healthy to enjoy your life and hobbies. See the picture of my barrel after it came out of my home built oven. With the mask I can concentrate on my painting and not where the vapors are floating. This mask works so good that I couldn&rsquo;t smell a dead mouse in the garbage can right next to me.</p>
