<h5 id="are-you-here-because-you-too-couldn-t-get-a-nes-classic-edition-look-no-further">Are you here because you too couldn&rsquo;t get a NES Classic Edition? Look no further!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tiny computer is amazing for emulation. Why spend $60 on a NES Classic when this can play NES, SNES, GB, GBC, GBA, Master System, Genesis games, and many more! Unlike with the NES Classic Edition, which only has 30 games, this lets you add as many as you want! The NES Classic controller has a 24 inch long cord. lame. Raspberry Pi works with practically any USB controller, even wireless bluetooth ones! This is cheaper than the NES Classic, and you can actually BUY ONE. It&rsquo;s Nintendo&rsquo;s loss for not making more.Assembly of the Retropie is so easy! Just put the motherboard inside the clear case and it snaps shut. Download Retropie from their website, extract the program from the Zip Folder, and write it onto a Micro SD Card using win32diskimager (a free, easy to find program). Then just insert that Micro SD Card in the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. After it boots up, plug any empty flash drive into the Raspberry Pi, and it&rsquo;ll create all the necessary folders for roms. Then remove the flash drive when its light stops flashing and use your PC to put the right roms into the right folders, then plug that flash drive back into the Raspberry Pi. It&rsquo;ll copy over all the roms, so you won&rsquo;t need the flash drive anymore. And that&rsquo;s it! Just configure your controller and your done! Its so easy even a dummy like me could do it! I mostly use it for 2D games and they all run and look great in HD!</p>

<h5 id="the-kit-works-the-stupid-case-needs-some-plastic-removed-to-fit-a-microsd-card-you-might-want-to-do-that">The Kit works. The stupid case needs some plastic removed to fit a microSD card. You might want to do that.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT #2: The seller replaced the Black case with the new Clear VILROS one &ndash; much better. Thanks! Raised rating from 2 stars to 5, on the presumption that this is what people will receive going forward, as the description shows.EDIT: This item has changed since I ordered it in January 2017. The description and picture now say &ldquo;Clear Case&rdquo;. I received a black plastic case that didn&rsquo;t fit. Beware the seller is changing stuff.It&rsquo;s a nicely-packaged kit: Pi3, case, heatsinks, and power supply. The RPi3 is the real deal, from element14, so you&rsquo;re not paying much extra for the bonus giblets. Heatsinks fit okay, but I am unsure about the adhesive used. It feels like regular stickum, not anything specifically thermally conductive. The last thing you want is to put a blanket over your CPU, right? I feel some heat in the fins, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. The second smaller heatsink seems like a &ldquo;why not&rdquo; more than a must-have. Not even warm on my unit. You can see from the thermal photo that the heatsinks are not the warmest part of the board.I&rsquo;m taking off two stars because&hellip; just when you think &ldquo;My, this case fit together well, and fits perfectly!&rdquo; You realize that you&rsquo;ll be taking it all back apart again to get your microSD card in or out. For reasons I can&rsquo;t fathom, the &lsquo;slot&rsquo; cut for the card is not where the card is. In fact, if you try to be clever and put your card in <em>FIRST</em>, then assemble the case, you&rsquo;ll probably bust your card slot! The case will apply a lot of pressure to the lip of the card before the RPi fits on the case mount-posts, and either the card, the slot, or your tender care will fail.Yeah, taking off one more star because using this case as-is can cause damage to card or RPi.That was pretty confusing to explain, so I added a picture for visual types, as a reward for reading through that.I had to hog out the card slot more than a little bit with a knife and file. You can see my &lsquo;expanded&rsquo; microSD card slot. Those of you with power tools will probably make quick work of creating a gaping wound for your microSD card to fit through, but I don&rsquo;t judge. In any case, if you do nothing and use it as-described, it will bust something.Now, if you want to take OFF the top of the case, while the RPi is powered on, to take temperature of whatever, then.. well, you can not. The side covers hold the lid on, and the side covers go around your power connector, so you&rsquo;ll be shutting down that fine operating system.So, let&rsquo;s review.. RPi is just pure gold for value, USB power supply works, heatsinks are the right size, and case is manufactured by someone who&rsquo;s never actually used a RPi.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-kit-wtih-a-nice-case-and-quality-power-supply">Excellent kit wtih a nice case and quality power supply</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice kit. The power supply and its cable feel thick and robust, the clear case is nice, fits the Raspberry Pi perfectly, and clicks together nicely. I didn&rsquo;t bother with the heat sinks though as there is debate on weather they&rsquo;re necessary with some reports of them actually raising chip temperatures if not used with better thermal conducting adhesive.The Raspberry Pi 3 is noticeably higher performance than my 2 was, I especially see this when trying to play Youtube videos in Raspbian or playing retro video games. It has integrated wifi and bluetooth too so no need for USB wifi. My only complaint is that my 2 had a spring loaded micro-SD slot but the 3&rsquo;s microSD slot isn&rsquo;t spring loaded so it&rsquo;s a smidge harder when swapping cards in and out.</p>

<h5 id="case-doesn-t-fit-well-and-causes-pi-to-fail">Case doesn&rsquo;t fit well and causes Pi to fail</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The kit is fine - except the cheap case an ruin your Pi or SD memory card. I&rsquo;ve purchased 10 of these now, and three times, by placing the nice Pi in that cheap case which doesn&rsquo;t fit well, the onboard WiFi has quit working (once), or the SD memory card has shorted-out and gets hot (twice). Each time the Pi had been working fine until I closed it in the case. Once it caused a great inconvenience as I had to rebuild the entire OS and app software stack while on the road. Now I use an alternative case. Two stars as it is a nice kit, and cheap enough, but this failure point makes it a pain if you&rsquo;re using it for an application beyond playing around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-starter-kit">Love this starter kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great package for the price. I wanted to get my own sdcard, and I already had an HDMI cable to use so I just wanted something simple (Case, heatsink, and power). I am using this for Retropie to play some old school games, and this setup works great for that. The power adapter is long and works good for placing on a desk or in an entertainment center. The case was a little finicky at first, but with some effort it did fit. The included screws didn&rsquo;t seem to work, but the snaps on the case did the job. The sink come with what seems to be double sided tape and stick on both cards just fine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone starting with a pi 3 and need it to be enclosed and set somewhere on a desk of sorts.F.Y.I., It does come with the Pi</p>
